When different β/RR/OR values for different percentiles, tertiles, or quartiles of PFOA instead of continuous trends were provided in included studies, the strongest association with the outcome (worst-case scenario) was selected [21]. The effect sizes were pooled using the inverse variance method for random-effects meta-analysis [22]. Heterogeneity was measured with the I 2 statistic and was represented on a scale ranging from 0% to 100%. I 2 values of 25%, 50%, and 75% were considered as low, medium, and high heterogeneity, respectively [23]. A random-effects model was used to summarize data to reduce the impact of heterogeneity between studies [22]. Subgroup analyses were carried out by effect size, measurement timing, geographical region, gender and with or without adjustment of maternal parity and birth weight to explore possible sources of heterogeneity.

Specifically, this systematic review aimed to answer the question, “For the general population, what effect does exposure from PFAS chemicals via indoor media have on serum concentrations of PFAS?” To address this question, estimated serum concentrations of PFAS calculated from measurements of PFAS in these media were calculated to explain variability in participant PFAS levels from sources other than drinking water and diet.

However, two studies (Kim et al., 2015; Derakhshan et al., 2021) did not well define inclusive and exclusive criteria, therefore, they were deemed to be at moderate RoB for this domain. Third, all studies assessed prenatal exposure using appropriate biospecimens (Table 1). So, all studies were deemed to be at low RoB for this domain. Forth, bias due to departures from intended interventions was less likely, because all studies were prospective cohort studies. Fifth, most of the studies excluded subjects if they had missing exposure data, and all of them adopted health registries or local hospital database which was judged to have less missing data. Sixth, all studies extracted thyroid hormone outcomes from health registries or hospital databases. Therefore, they were assessed to be at low RoB in measurement of outcomes. Last, all studies were assessed to be at low risk of bias in selection of the reported result, because none of our included studies had evidence of selective reporting. Ultimately, four studies were judged to have a moderate RoB, and the remaining studies were judged to have a low RoB.""",1 = “Yes” = included only low risk of bias studies OR the review provided a discussion of the likely impact of RoB on the results.,"""In addition, when we excluded studies with moderate RoB, the pooling regression coefficients of TSH ([...]) were also robust.

For that purpose, we used different combinations of contaminant names (PFASs, NFRs, bisphenols, paraffins, neonicotinoids, benzophenones, UV-filters, parabens) and European countries as keywords along with “Europe”, “raptors”, “birds of prey”, “owls” “contamination”, “predators” “scavengers” and species (whitetailed eagle, Northern gowshak, peregrine falcon, Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), red kite (Milvus milvus), long-eared owl (Asio otus), barn owl (Tyto alba), tawny owl (Strix aluco), common buzzard (Buteo buteo), and others) and/or matrices names (eggs, fat, feathers, blood, plasma, liver, internal tissues, bones). References from the collected publications were also reviewed to ensure that all relevant studies were included. Although a limited period of time was not initially set, all the peer-reviewed studies of our interest were published in the period 2002–2020, which was finally considered. Finally, 37 studies were included in the review. For each study, concentrations of contaminants, analytical methods employed, sample types and discussion on temporal trends and comparison of levels with legacy compounds were collected. Contaminants were classified in three major classes: perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), novel flame retardants (NFRs) and other miscellaneous CECs, namely, bisphenols, UV-filters, neonicotinoids, paraffins and parabens. Concentrations in the text are provided as ranges, means or medians of single contaminants or contaminant classes (total sum of the concencentrations of all the contaminants within a class) and expressed in ng g−1 or ng mL−1 .

Studies assessing OC compounds were further subdivided into those investigating polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), chlorophenol pesticides and triclosan.The methodological quality of each study was appraised, and sources of heterogeneity, including differences in exposure measurement (eg, categorical vs continuous, any adjustment) and clinical outcome (eg, type of anthropometric measure, categorical vs continuous) were identified. For studies with a similar data source, we included only the study with the largest sample size. Meta-analysis was performed when more than a single study per outcome had a similar design, exposure assessment and outcome measures so that we could have a meaningful pooled effect. As heterogeneity was high among studies reporting continuous outcome data, only three different categorical outcomes were assessed: prevalent overweight, prevalent obesity and prevalent elevated WC. For each exposure (EDC) and outcome, adjusted OR with 95% CIs were extracted and pooled with random-effect model, as we expected some heterogeneity across the studies. Except for BC studies, we considered OR estimates from the highest versus lower EDCs levels. Because the association between exposure to some brominated metabolites and body mass measures in many studies showed an inverted U-shaped relationship, we collected OR estimates from intermediary categories of metabolite levels. Heterogeneity between study results was evaluated with χ2 test and quantified by I2 statistic (I²>75%considered as high heterogeneity).16 Possible causes of heterogeneity were explored with additional sensitivity analyses clustering the results by age (children vs adults) or by EDC metabolite/compound.

""We considered baby sex, gestational age, maternal age, prepregnancy BMI, education, parity, and smoking to be the most important potential confounders of the relationship between PFAA and BrthW, as they have been shown to be associated with both exposure and outcome. However, when we restricted the analysis to studies with full adjustment for these confounders, results were similar to those including all studies. On one hand, another important potential confounder, related to both exposure and outcome, is glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Some studies have shown that women whose GFR fails to rise sufficiently during pregnancy tend to have smaller babies (Verner et al. 2015). On the other hand, GFR is likely to influence the urinary excretion of xenobiotics like PFAA. Indeed, higher blood PFAA levels have been observed in people with lower GFR (Verner et al. 2015). As renal elimination in humans seems to be negligible and no study adjusted for GFR, the influence of GFR on the results remains undefined. On one hand, fish consumption is another potential confounder since fish contains considerable amounts of PFAAs (Brantsaeter et al. 2013). On the other hand, fish intake has been suggested to have a favorable role on fetal growth (Brantsaeter et al. 2013). One study only (Whitworth et al. 2012) included lean fish intake in the regression model, and its results were not statistically heterogeneous with the pooled estimates of the other studies (data not shown). Besides confounding, other sources of bias must be considered, and for systematic reviews publication bias specifically. Among studies that were excluded because they did not report the outcome of interest, it is possible that some found a null association. However, the statistical tests we applied did not suggest that publication bias did occur.""",1 = “Yes” = There was no significant heterogeneity in the results OR if heterogeneity was present the authors performed an investigation of sources of any heterogeneity in the results and discussed the impact of this on the results of the review.,"""Heterogeneity was quantified by Cochran’s v2 statistic Q and by the I 2 statistics, i.e. the percentage of variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance (Higgins & Thompson 2002). [...] While for PFOA we did not find a marked heterogeneity between subgroups, for PFOS the heterogeneity was marked, with a stronger effect in late pregnancy and even stronger in umbilical cord blood. This is consistent with the reduction in PFOS serum levels during pregnancy; a difference of 1 ng/mL in umbilical cord blood would correspond to a higher difference if the sample were taken early during pregnancy. This would result in a higher difference in BrthW when using umbilical cord blood PFOS levels as a reference. Consequently, to account for these differences, we used a correction coefficient according to timing and matrix of collection to conduct the meta-regression of effect estimate associated with mean/median PFOA/PFOS blood levels in the study population. [...] For PFOS, the summary estimate for eight studies analyzing untransformed PFOS was close to zero and not significant, although with high heterogeneity (I 2 ¼ 74%). Conversely, the meta-analytic estimate of nine studies presenting log-transformed PFOS levels was that BrthW decreases by 46 g for an increase in PFOS blood levels of 2.7 times. This estimate was statistically significant and heterogeneity between studies was low (I 2 ¼ 25%). The difference in these results may be due to the true form of the relation between PFOS levels and BrthW. If this were the case, the relation should be steeper at lower PFOS levels, since the logarithmic transformation tends to accentuate differences at lower values. However, it is also possible that the difference in results is due to the differences between the studies included in the two meta-analyses or to a lower influence of outliers when using the logarithmic transformation.""",1 = “Yes” = The authors performed graphical or statistical tests for publication bias and discussed the likelihood and magnitude of impact of publication bias.,"""Publication bias was investigated by funnel plots (Sterne & Egger 2001) and by the tests proposed by Begg and Mazumdar (1994) and by Egger (Egger et al. 1997).

In order to use all available data, we included in the meta-analysis all studies that reported the GM and GSD for the chemicals of interest, even if the paper was missing other information. Five studies were excluded at this stage because they did not report GM and GSD, or because they examined chemicals measured by fewer than two other studies (so pooled GM estimates from three data sets could not be calculated).54−58 In total, we were able to include data from 26 papers and one unpublished data set in the meta-analysis (Figure 1).

Below-MDL values were imputed by each study’s author, and most commonly were assigned the value of MDL/2 or MDL/√2 (SI Table S4).

In cases where a study contained more than one geographic location (e.g., sampling in two states), each study location was counted as a separate data set. In cases where a corresponding author sent GM or GSD estimates that differed from the published data, we used the estimates sent by the author.

RoB mentioned or not sufficiently assessed (e.g. if multiple sources of bias potentially present, but not all assessed).","The review authors did not use a recognized assessment tool of bias (RoB) in individual studies that were included in the review. However, the authors discussed the selection bias. ""Other than bias due to confounding or systematic differences in the reporting of outcomes, discussed above, selection bias is another potential concern in some of the studies discussed in this review. Particularly in cross-sectional and case-control studies, in which subjects may be aware of their health status and exposure status at the time of enrollment, selection bias may arise if the decision to participate is influenced by this awareness. Even if the exposure and outcome themselves do not directly affect participation rates, selection bias can occur if participation is influenced by other factors, such as sociodemographic characteristics, that are associated with the exposure and outcome. In some cross-sectional and case-control studies, fewer than half of eligible subjects elected to participate (Anderson-Mahoney et al. 2008; Emmett et al. 2006b; Lin et al. 2011), and none had participation rates over 75% after accounting for exclusions due to missing data (Innes et al. 2011; Olsen et al. 2003) (omitting those that did not report participation rates (Costa et al. 2009; Dong et al. 2013; Humblet et al. 2014; Kielsen et al. 2015; Uhl et al. 2013)). In the presence of substantial non-participation, the potential magnitude of selection bias is greater. In prospective cohort studies, the likelihood of selection bias due to unequal participation rates is lower because subjects are recruited prior to the onset of health conditions. Selection bias may occur at the time of enrollment if the decision to participate is affected by one’s awareness of their future disease risk (e.g. due to having a positive family history) and exposure level, or factors associated with both, but this is a less likely scenario. Additionally, selection bias can occur during follow-up if the decision to drop out of the study is related to exposure and outcome. Therefore, reported study follow-up rates of 12–89% among subjects originally enrolled in prospective cohorts (Ashley-Martin et al. 2015; Grandjean et al. 2012; Granum et al. 2013; Okada et al. 2012, 2014; Pennings et al. 2015; Smit et al. 2015; Steenland et al. 2013, 2015; Wang et al. 2011) raise varying degrees of concern about potential selection bias. Selection bias can also arise if the source populations for exposed and unexposed subjects differ systematically by outcome status, or if the source populations for cases and controls differ systematically by exposure status, independently of any true association between the exposure and outcome. Although most studies used internal comparison groups, thereby avoiding bias due to non-comparable source populations, studies susceptible to this bias were a case-control study of children with asthma diagnosed at one of two hospitals, compared with children without asthma selected from seven public schools in the same geographic region of Taiwan (Dong et al. 2013); and especially a crosssectional study of volunteers included in a class action lawsuit due to their residence near a PFOA-contaminated river in Ohio and West Virginia, compared with nationally representative survey data (Anderson-Mahoney et al. 2008).""","1 = “Yes” = Must have reported on the sources of funding for individual studies included in the review.

[...] Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the systematic review were as follows. (1) Exposures: Chemicals that by the European Commission are classified as Category 1 endocrine disruptors with high concern in terms of human or wildlife exposure (McCarthy, 2011). Category 1 compounds are defined as chemicals where at least one study has shown endocrine effects in an intact organism. The EU report lists 60 Category 1 substances (29 chemical groups) that are highly persistent or have high current production volume (McCarthy, 2011). In addition we include the polyfluorinated chemicals, a group of ubiquitous biopersistent emerging endocrine disruptors (White et al., 2011) that are receiving increasing attention. Table I lists the specific chemical substances with abbreviations that are referenced in the text and in Tables II–VII. (2) Outcomes: Cryptorchidism (one or both testicles undescended) ascertained at birth or during childhood, hypospadias, testicular cancer regardless of histological subgroup, and sperm count (number of spermatozoa per volume or mass unit of seminal fluid). (3) Exposure to specific chemicals in utero or in the first year of life (postnatal exposure) documented by measurements in biological specimens (maternal blood or urine, placenta or fat tissue as well as amnion fluid, cord blood or breast milk). In addition serum concentrations in adult life as proxies for fetal or early life exposure were also included for testicular cancer. (4) Outcome ascertainment by medical standardized examination or antecedent medical records or reporting to health registries. (5) Risk estimates (rate risk [RR], OR, hazard ratio [HR]) for an outcome according to higher versus lower levels of prenatal and postnatal exposure defined by exposure contrasts within the given study. Studies reporting alternative measures of association such as difference in mean values of exposure levels in cases and controls were also included, and the authors were contacted to get risk estimates (Hosie et al., 2000; Damgaard et al., 2006; Main et al., 2007; Choi et al., 2012; Fenichel et al., 2012; Komarowska et al., 2015; Virtanen et al., 2012).

For each study, other sources of bias were evaluated against a predefined list of seven potential sources of bias and confounding adapted from validated checklists in order to fit the type of studies and research questions addressed in this review (Shamliyan et al., 2010); these are as follows: (1) Reporting of tested hypotheses: Many studies perform multiple comparisons because numerous chemical compounds have been measured. A high risk of bias towards in flated risk estimates is likely if risk estimates are selectively reported compared to objectives or available data. (2) Sample size justi fication (power calculations and/or addressing sample size in discussion): Small numbers of cases and/or exposed may increase the risk of false negative reporting and thus cause bias towards the null. (3) Selection bias due to attrition in follow-up studies and non-response in case-referent studies: Attrition/non-response >20% or attrition/ non-response differing by >10% in exposed/cases and unexposed/ referents was considered as a potential cause of bias in an unpredictable direction. (4) Information bias (outcome ascertainment): Outcomes identified by patient recall in questionnaires, by interview or medical examination not blinded towards exposure status is a likely cause of inflated risk estimates because of differential exposure misclassification. (5) Confounding: Failure to account by study design or analysis for major potentially confounding factors including maternal age, parity, prematurity, social class and ethnicity was considered as high risk of bias in unpredictable directions. Other potentially confounding factors were considered on an outcome specific basis: Cryptorchidism is a strong risk factor for testis cancer and low sperm count, sexual abstinence and maternal smoking during pregnancy is related to sperm count and the sons age is related to risk of testis cancer. Weak and/or uncertain risk factors such as paternal age, maternal consumption of coffee and alcoholic beverages, infections, malformed uterus and poorly controlled diabetes were not considered. (6) Measuring of confounding factors: Potential bias in an unpredictable direction was considered if measures of confounding factors were invalid or inadequate. (7) Exposure contrast: Studies contrasting exposure levels by the median split rather than by at least exposure-tertiles were considered at risk of bias towards the null because of insufficient exposure contrast. We considered selective reporting related to multiple testing (1), selection bias (3), information bias related to outcome ascertainment (4) and failure to account for major confounding factors (5) as the most important threats to validity. Accordingly, we categorized a study as at higher risk of bias if two or more of these sources of bias were present. Risk of bias across studies was evaluated by means of funnel plots to assess risk of publication bias.""",0 = ”No” = no report of the sources of funding for individual studies included in the review.,no report of the sources of funding for individual studies included in the review,1 = “Yes” = The authors justified combining the data in a meta-analysis AND they used an appropriate technique to combine study results and adjusted for heterogeneity if present AND investigated the causes of any heterogeneity or adjusted for heterogeneity or confounding if present.,"""We applied a stepwise approach addressing four different scenarios for the association between chemical exposure and included outcomes with increasing level of specificity. Only cryptorchidism, hypospadias and testicular cancer were included in Steps (1)–(4) below, as none of the four papers addressing sperm count provided risk estimates. The following associations were analysed: (1) The association between all types of endocrine disrupting chemicals with all outcomes assuming that effects occur regardless of specific mechanisms and that the four outcomes are manifestations of the same underlying condition (testicular dysgenesis syndrome; Skakkebaek, 2002). This analysis assumes that all types of examined individual compounds are proxies for mixtures of substances that carry the same risk for the adverse reproductive outcomes. This assumption is very unlikely to be true, but the analysis is informative when considering global statements on the impact of endocrine disruptors that do not single out individual substances or mixtures of particular concern (Bergman et al., 2013). (2) The associations between specific chemicals and all outcomes. Hereby, we account for different endocrine disrupting actions and potencies exhibited by different compounds and address the testicular dysgenesis hypothesis stating that all male reproductive outcomes at least partly are manifestations of the same underlying causal agents operating in early life (Skakkebaek et al., 2001;Skakkebaek, 2003, 2004). One study reported multiple PCB and PBDE congener specific risk estimates but no summary estimate (Carmichael et al., 2010). For this study, we selected the PCB-153 and PBDE-100 as indicators of the total exposure to these compounds and did not include the other congener specific estimates (12 estimates). Another study reported the p,p′-DDE exposure estimate as well as an estimate for the sum of HCB and p,p′-DDE but no separate estimate for HCB (too few cases). In this case, we used the sum of the p,p′-DDE and HCB estimate (Giannandrea et al., 2011). (3) The associations between all exposures and specific outcomes, assuming that endocrine disrupting chemicals in general carry a risk for some but not other male reproductive disorders. (4) Each of the three outcomes individually in relation to specific compounds or group of compounds under the assumption of specific mechanisms and specific outcomes, but without an a priori ranking of more or less likely specific hypotheses. These exploratory analyses have a narrow scope because data are limited. We only included exposure–outcome estimates in the meta-analysis if four or more risk estimates were available. In sensitivity analyses, we: (i) regrouped compounds into persistent or rapidly metabolised substances with half-lives in the range of hours; (ii) excluded studies with blood sampling after the diagnosis of testicular cancer; (iii) examined the effect of each study on the overall estimate by excluding the studies one at a time; (iv) performed separate analyses of studies with high completeness of reporting and lower risk of bias and confounding as defined above; and (v) performed separate analyses of large case-referent studies with at least 75 cases. We computed a common risk estimate across studies by weighing the risk ratio (RR) or equivalent (OR or HR) by the inverse variance computed from the mean of the provided confidence limits. This is justified because the outcomes are rare (prevalence <5%). Random effects estimates are presented regardless of tests for heterogeneity since all studies are conceptually heterogeneous. Nevertheless we also provide I 2 statistics as a formal measure of heterogeneity. Bootstrapping techniques were used in analyses where the same study yielded more than one risk estimate, to account for multiple risk estimates per person in studies where risk estimates were reported for several compounds or outcomes. Bootstrapping with 500 repeats was applied by sampling among all included risk estimates, ensuring that each study only contributed one risk estimate to each bootstrapping step. Mean values across bootstrapped steps were used as overall measures of common risk estimates and confidence limits. These analyses were repeated for each outcome to account for heterogeneity in the exposure–outcome relation. All statistical analyses were performed using R and a significance level of 0.05. We also used this software to create funnel plots of the standard error by the logarithm of the RR separately for each of the exposures and for the higher quality studies, and inspected these plots for evidence of publication bias"".",0 = ”No” = no assessment of the potential impact of RoB.,"""The completeness of reporting assessed by 11 items were considered high (sum score ≥8 of 11 items) for over 65% of the papers.

We consulted experts in the field of PFOA toxicity, toxicological study design, or human/animal toxicity reviews to develop these characteristics and their associated heterogeneity concerns beforehand. For example, we considered the differences in PFOA clearance rates between female mice (approximately 17 days) and rats (2–4 hr) as a potential biological heterogeneity concern (Lau et al. 2007). From the assessment of specified characteristics, we determined that only a subset of data was combinable in a meta-analysis. This subset of seven studies (eight data sets) had the following characteristics: • Species: mouse • Route of exposure: gavage • Method of outcome measurement: weight • Time point of outcome measurement: at or soon after birth. We used the mean (± SE) pup body weight at birth from each of the eight data sets for all PFOA doses < 5 mg/kg body weight (mg/kg BW)/day. We limited the dose range in order to focus on effects at lower tested doses and to minimize adverse impacts from responses at higher doses (such as litter loss) on the overall estimate. We used a two-step modeling approach. In the first step, we analyzed each data set separately using a linear mixed-effects model, and we obtained a slope estimate of the dose–response effect (and the associated SE). In the second step, we combined the slope and SE estimate from each data set using a random-effects model. The result was an estimate of the overall mean change in body weight per offspring for a 1-unit increase in mg/kg BW/day dose, accounting for within- and betweenstudy variability. We used the programming environment R, version 2.13.1 (R Development Core Team; http://www.Rproject.org/) and its standard packages. We used the metafor package in R (Viechtbauer 2010) for conducting our random effects meta-analysis. To visually assess the possibility of publication bias in a meta-analysis, we considered producing a funnel plot of the estimated effects. However, tests for funnel plot asymmetry are not recommended when there are < 10 studies because test power is usually too low to distinguish chance from real asymmetry (Sterne et al. 2011a). Because our meta-analysis was limited to 7 studies (8 data sets), we did not produce a funnel plot.

We developed an instrument for rating risk of bias by modifying existing risk of bias instruments used in human studies in the clinical sciences, that is the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool (Higgins and Green 2011) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s (AHRQ) criteria (Viswanathan et al. 2012). The Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool does not currently include a specific domain for bias related to study funding source, but this is an area of active discussion among its members (Bero 2013; Sterne 2013). The Cochrane Collaboration has recognized the importance of identifying study funding source, which has been empirically shown to be associated with biases (Krauth et al. 2014; Lundh et al. 2012). However, there is currently limited consensus on whether the study funding source should be included as a separate risk of bias domain or generally reported and commented on within the Cochrane systematic review (Bero 2013; Sterne 2013). A recent report from the NRC recommended that the U.S. EPA consider funding sources in their risk of bias assessment conducted for systematic reviews (NRC 2014). On the basis of the recommendations mentioned above, we also included study funding source and declared financial conflicts of interest as a potential source of bias (i.e., whether the study received support from a company, study author, or other entity having a financial interest in the outcome of the study). We refer to this risk of bias domain generally as “conflicts of interest,” although for this particular case study we assessed only competing financial interests within this domain. A complete list of the human and nonhuman risk of bias domains is presented in Figure 1; detailed descriptions of each domain are provided by Koustas et al. (2014) and Johnson et al. (2014). Each risk of bias domain was assigned a determination of “high,” “probably high,” “low,” or “probably low” risk of bias based on previously determined criteria (Johnson et al. 2014; Koustas et al. 2014). We followed the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) principles for evaluating overall risk of bias by judiciously considering the frequency of each type of bias across all studies, evaluating the extent to which each study contributed toward the magnitude of effect estimate, and being conservative in the judgment of rating down (i.e., evidence was rated down only if risk of bias was clearly a substantial issue across most studies) (Viswanathan et al. 2012).""",0 = ”No” = no report of the sources of funding for individual studies included in the review.,no report of the sources of funding for individual studies included in the review,1 = “Yes” = The authors justified combining the data in a meta-analysis AND they used an appropriate technique to combine study results and adjusted for heterogeneity if present AND investigated the causes of any heterogeneity or adjusted for heterogeneity or confounding if present.,"""For both human and nonhuman studies, we assessed study characteristics (i.e., study features and biological heterogeneity) to identify studies suitable for meta-analysis. We used a random-effects meta-analysis approach using the DerSimonian-Laird estimator of potential statistical heterogeneity across studies (DerSimonian and Laird 1986). All computations for the human studies metaanalysis were done in STATA, version 12.1 (StataCorp LP) using the “metaan” command. All computations for the meta-analysis of nonhuman studies were performed in the programming environment R, version 2.13.1 (R Development Core Team; http://www.Rproject.org/), using the package “metafor” (Viechtbauer 2010). To visually assess the possibility of publication bias in a meta-analysis, we considered producing a funnel plot of the estimated effects. However, tests for funnel plot asymmetry are not recommended when there are fewer than 10 studies because test power is usually too low to distinguish chance from real asymmetry (Sterne et al. 2011). Because our meta-analysis for animals and humans was limited to < 10 studies each, we did not produce a funnel plot. Statistical heterogeneity. We tested study variability using Cochran’s Q statistic to detect whether differences in the estimated effect between studies could be explained by chance alone or due to nonrandom sources of variability between studies. We considered a p-value < 0.05 to be statistically significant. We also calculated the I2 statistic, which estimates the percentage of variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance (Higgins et al. 2003). To assess the impact of existing study heterogeneity on the meta-analysis, we considered the magnitude/ direction of effect estimates, the Cochrane Collaboration’s guidelines to interpreting the I2 values (Deeks et al. 2011), and statistical tests of heterogeneity (e.g., by assessing the p-value from the Cochran’s Q test).""","0.5 = “Can’t answer / not sure / partially” = Cannot decide between “yes” and “no”, basing on the information provided in the paper.",NA,"0.5 = “Can’t answer / not sure / partially” = Cannot decide between “yes” and “no”, basing on the information provided in the paper.",NA,1 = “Yes” = There was no significant heterogeneity in the results OR if heterogeneity was present the authors performed an investigation of sources of any heterogeneity in the results and discussed the impact of this on the results of the review.,"""We tested study variability using Cochran’s Q statistic to detect whether differences in the estimated effect between studies could be explained by chance alone or due to nonrandom sources of variability between studies.

For the pooled analysis, if risk estimates derived from the highest level of exposure versus the reference level were not available, risk estimates for per-unit change in each analyte were extracted. When risk estimates were available for groups of chemicals, for instance, PCB congeners, we used the summed risk estimates. Otherwise, we selected indicator congeners, such as PCB-153, to reflect the levels of all respective congeners. Publication bias was evaluated with funnel plot. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses in our study. χ2-Q statistics and I 2 statistics were used to assess heterogeneity, with I 2 >50% indicating heterogeneity. A random-effects model was adopted regardless of heterogeneity because all studies were conceptually heterogeneous. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were used to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses according to year of publication, study design, study area, race (Asian dominant or non-Asian dominant), maternal age at delivery (more than 30 years of age or not), timing of specimen collection (early, mid or late pregnancy), and biopersistence of EDCs was conducted. Subgroup analyses based on each metal and chemical were performed when three or more risk estimates for each EDC were provided. Meta-regression analyses according to parity, alcohol and smoking exposure, maternal education level (education level above high school), marital status (unmarried or living alone), and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) were performed.

The studies of both Boggia et al. and Yoshinaga et al. had |z| scores > 2. The presence of the latter was visually inspected by funnel plots and tested by Egger’s test [28]. Statistical significance was set at a p level of 0.05.
