rayyan-421819839,Temporal trends of contaminants in Arctic human populations,2018,1,1,,,,,,"Abass K., Emelyanova A., Rautio A.",,,,,"The first Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) report was published in 1998 and followed by three assessment reports of human health (AMAP 2003, 2009 and 2015). The focus area of the AMAP reports was to monitor levels of environmental contaminants in the Arctic and to assess the health effects connected with detected levels in Arctic countries. This review gives an overview of temporal trends of contaminants and their health effects in humans of the Arctic based on data published by AMAP, as well as Russian scientific literature. Several time series of 31 contaminants in humans of the Arctic from different cohorts are reported. The lengths of time series and periods covered differ from each other. International restrictions have decreased the levels of most persistent organic pollutants in humans and food webs. Percentage changes for contaminants in human biological matrices (blood samples from children, mothers and males and breast milk samples) for the period of sampling showed declining trends in most of the monitored Arctic locations, with the exception of oxychlordane, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), 2,2′,4,4′,5,5′-hexabromodiphenyl ether (PBDE153) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs). © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s11356-018-2936-8,Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,
rayyan-421819841,Understanding the impact of perfluorinated compounds on cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors: A meta‐analysis study,2021,1,1,,,,,,"Abdullah Soheimi S.S., Abdul Rahman A., Abdul Latip N., Ibrahim E., Sheikh Abdul Kadir S.H.",,,,,"Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are non‐biodegradable synthetic chemical compounds that are widely used in manufacturing many household products. Many studies have reported the association between PFCs exposure with the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, those reports are still debatable, due to their findings. Thus, this review paper aimed to analyse the association of PFCs compound with CVDs and their risk factors in humans by systematic review and meta‐analysis. Google Scholar, PubMed and ScienceDirect were searched for PFCs studies on CVDs and their risk from 2009 until present. The association of PFCs exposure with the prevalence of CVDs and their risk factors were assessed by calculating the quality criteria, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). CVDs risk factors were divided into serum lipid profile (main risk factor) and other known risk factors. The meta‐analysis was then used to derive a combined OR test for heterogeneity in findings between studies. Twenty‐nine articles were included. Our meta‐analysis indicated that PFCs exposure could be associated with CVDs (Test for overall effect: z= 2.2, p = 0.02; Test for heterogeneity: I2 = 91.6%, CI = 0.92–1.58, p &lt; 0.0001) and their risk factors (Test for overall effect: z= 4.03, p &lt; 0.0001; Test for heterogeneity: I2 = 85.8%, CI = 1.00– 1.14, p &lt; 0.0001). In serum lipids, total cholesterol levels are frequently reported associated with the exposure of PFCs. Among PFCs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) exposure increased the risk of CVDs than other types of PFCs. Although the risk of PFOA and PFOS were positively associated with CVDs and their risk factors, more observational studies shall be carried out to identify the long‐term effects of these contaminants in premature CVDs development in patients. © 2021 by the authors.

This study reviews the issues concerning PFASs exposure and potential risks generated with a focus on PFAS occurrence and transformation in various media, discusses their physicochemical characterization and treatment technologies, before discussing the potential human exposure routes. The various toxicological impacts to human health are also discussed. The article pays particular attention to the complexity and challenging issue of regulating PFAS compounds due to the arising uncertainty and lack of epidemiological evidence encountered. The variation in PFAS regulatory values across the globe can be easily addressed due to the influence of multiple scientific, technical, and social factors. The varied toxicology and the insufficient definition of PFAS exposure rate are among the main factors contributing to this discrepancy. The lack of proven standard approaches for examining PFAS in surface water, groundwater, wastewater, or solids adds more technical complexity. Although it is agreed that PFASs pose potential health risks in various media, the link between the extent of PFAS exposure and the significance of PFAS risk remain among the evolving research areas. There is a growing need to address the correlation between the frequency and the likelihood of human exposure to PFAS and the possible health risks encountered. Although USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) recommends the 70 ng/L lifetime health advisory in drinking water for both perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFO) perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which is similar to the Australian regulations, the German Ministry of Health proposed a health-based guidance of maximum of 300 ng/L for the combination of PFOA and PFOS. Moreover, there are significant discrepancies among the US states where the water guideline levels for the different states ranged from 13 to 1000 ng L−1 for PFOA and/or PFOS. The current review highlighted the significance of the future research required to fill in the knowledge gap in PFAS toxicology and to better understand this through real field data and long-term monitoring programs. © 2020 by the authors.

Emerging pollutants (EPs) are ubiquitous anthropogenic compounds of environmental concern that can be found at different concentration levels in matrices such as sediment, water and aquatic biota. In addition, EPs can be bioaccumulated and biomagnified, inducing adverse effects on biota, and posing a risk to humans when contaminated biota is consumed. Unlike abiotic matrices, the occurrence of EPs in aquatic biota has not been widely studied. This is probably because their complexity, due to the presence of lipids, proteins and other organic compounds, makes the extraction and analysis of EPs difficult. This review gathers the most relevant analytical methods published between 2014 and 2019, comparing them and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses.

We review here the current HBM efforts for organophosphate esters, emerging flame retardants, perfluoroalkyl substances, and phthalate esters. Use of some of these chemicals has already been banned or restricted; they are regularly detected in the environment, wildlife, and human matrices. Traditionally, blood and urine collection have been widely used as sampling methods. New non-invasive approaches (e.g., saliva, hair, nails) are emerging as valid alternatives since they offer advantages with respect to sampling, handling, and ethical aspects, while ensuring similar reliability and sensitivity. Nevertheless, the identification of biomarkers of exposure is often difficult because chemicals may be metabolized in the human body. For many of the above-mentioned compounds, the mechanisms of the favorable metabolization pathways have not been unraveled, but research on important metabolites that could be used as biomarkers of exposure is growing.

They are widely used in industrial and consumer applications and are known for their persistence, long-distance migration and toxicity. Various PFASs have been manufactured and distributed over the years at a global scale. Decades of relevant research on these emerging contaminants has revealed that PFASs are bioaccumulative and possibly carcinogenic to animals as well as humans. Following regulations and public concern about their impact on ecosystems and uncertain environmental fate, some legacy PFASs have been banned in some regions e.g. Europe, and their industrial production has switched to alternative fluoroalkyl substances. Recently, novel PFAS classes have been identified in numerous environmental matrices. The high variety of legacy and emerging PFASs across the ecosystems is alarming and calls for an efficient monitoring strategy for the quantitative determination of known substances as well as the elucidation and discovery of new compounds. This is crucial for PFAS management and risk assessment in the environment and merits the attention of regulators. This review reports and discusses the most recent analytical method development for PFASs in air, water, abiotic solid matrices and biological matrices. Various instrumental analysis techniques and screening approaches are presented, explored, and compared on the basis of their efficiency and applicability, together with sampling, pre-treatment and extraction methods. Additionally, promising non-target and non-specific approaches are addressed as the key-element in future PFAS analysis. © 2022 The Author(s).

Based on information for a few relatively well-understood PFAS such as perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoate, there is ample basis to suspect that at least a subset can be considered persistent, bioaccumulative, and/or toxic. However, data suitable for determining risks in either prospective or retrospective assessments are lacking for the majority of PFAS. In August 2019, the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry sponsored a workshop that focused on the state-of-the-science supporting risk assessment of PFAS. The present review summarizes discussions concerning the ecotoxicology and ecological risks of PFAS. First, we summarize currently available information relevant to problem formulation/prioritization, exposure, and hazard/effects of PFAS in the context of regulatory and ecological risk assessment activities from around the world. We then describe critical gaps and uncertainties relative to ecological risk assessments for PFAS and propose approaches to address these needs. Recommendations include the development of more comprehensive monitoring programs to support exposure assessment, an emphasis on research to support the formulation of predictive models for bioaccumulation, and the development of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods to efficiently assess biological effects for potentially sensitive species/endpoints. Addressing needs associated with assessing the ecological risk of PFAS will require cross-disciplinary approaches that employ both conventional and new methods in an integrated, resource-effective manner.

An association of a reduction of vaccination efficacy with PFAS serum levels in humans was used by the European Food Safety Authority as a key effect for PFAS risk assessment. The data support for using this association is reviewed by a critical analysis of the respective human epidemiology and the available animal studies on the immunomodulation of PFAS. Based on an analysis of the available human epidemiology, the overall level of evidence regarding associations between PFAS serum levels and reduced antibody response remains weak. Absence of an association between an increase in clinical infections and PFAS serum levels and the limited understanding of the importance of antibody levels as an isolated data point further support this conclusion. Animal toxicity studies with PFAS focusing on immunomodulation also provide only limited support for immunomodulation as an important endpoint in PFAS toxicity. While immunomodulation is observed after PFAS administration, generally at blood concentrations several orders of magnitude above those seen in environmentally exposed humans, the relevance of these observation is hampered by the high doses required to influence immune endpoints, the limited number of endpoints assessed, and inconsistent results. The limitations of the current database on associations of human PFAS exposures outlined here indicate that more evidence is required to select immunomodulation as a critical endpoint for human PFAS risk assessment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00204-022-03303-4,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Animals;Animal Shells;Immunologic Factors,,

The aim of this study was to provide comprehensive evidence on PFAS transfer rates across the human placental barrier by means of a meta-analysis based upon a systematic review. The available literature up to April 2021 was reviewed and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) of PFAS assessed. A total of 39 studies reporting data on 20 PFAS were included in the systematic review. Of these, 20 studies with data on 19 compounds were included in the meta-analysis. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA v3.0) was used for quantitative, statistical analyses with random effects models.

Despite having similar physicochemical properties, enantiomers may differ in their interactions with enzymes, receptors and other chiral molecules leading to different biological response. Their differences in bio-degradation, transformation or accumulation should be carefully considered when assessing health risks since they can affect living organisms in a different way. This work reviews the behavior of several groups of environmentally relevant chiral contaminants including pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, perfluoroalkyl substances, brominated flame retardants, pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls and their main metabolites. The enantioselectivity and fate of these compounds in: i) wastewater treatment plants, ii) aquatic and terrestrial environments; and iii) living organisms is discussed. It cannot be predicted whether each specific enantiomer of a chiral compound will be preferably enriched or degraded. The extent of stereoselectivity is associated to several factors, including the specific chiral pollutant, the environmental matrix, the treatment technology used, as well as the season and local environmental factors (pH, soil texture, porosity, organic amended), which are in turn influenced by the activity of the microbial communities.

Aspects of the bioaccumulation potential of IOCs in fish that can be characterized relatively well include the pH dependence of gill uptake and elimination, uptake in the gut, and sorption to phospholipids (membrane–water partitioning). Key challenges include the lack of empirical data for biotransformation and binding in plasma. Fish possess a diverse array of proteins that may transport IOCs across cell membranes. Except in a few cases, however, the significance of this transport for uptake and accumulation of environmental contaminants is unknown. Two case studies are presented. The first describes modeled effects of pH and biotransformation on the bioconcentration of organic acids and bases, while the second employs an updated model to investigate factors responsible for accumulation of perfluorinated alkyl acids. The perfluorinated alkyl acid case study is notable insofar as it illustrates the likely importance of membrane transporters in the kidney and highlights the potential value of read-across approaches. Recognizing the current need to perform bioaccumulation hazard assessments and ecological and exposure risk assessment for IOCs, the authors provide a tiered strategy that progresses (as needed) from conservative assumptions (models and associated data) to more sophisticated models requiring chemical-specific information.

Recent Findings: The evolving knowledge of mechanisms of hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis has recently been reviewed and characterized as ALD, NAFLD, and TAFLD. The most recent mechanistic studies on PFAS and PCBs have revealed a greater role for toxicants in the initiation of not only TAFLD but also NAFLD and the more progressive inflammatory stage of NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In addition to insecticides, recent studies support a significant contribution of fungicides and herbicides to NAFLD. Summary: The mechanisms of PFAS, PCBs, and fungicides in contributing to the increased prevalence of NAFLD remain unclear.

In this review, we have compiled the data on the levels of PFAAs in environmental samples, mainly in estuarine and coastal zones. A worldwide map was generated to show the distribution of PFAAs. The experimental results have also been considered, which, together with those of environmental samples, has allowed us to infer about the factors that intervene in the behavior of PFAAs. The presence of PFAAs is determined primarily by the source of pollution. Salinity is as well shown as a significant condition, dependent too on the sampling environment. The analysis of PFAAs from environmental samples constitutes a fundamental tool for the surveillance of these pollutants, but the lack of homogeneity of protocols for sampling, as well as for the results presentation, limits the comparative capacity. Laboratory studies are also an essential tool in the analysis of particular aspects related to PFAAs, but many times the conditions tested are not environmentally significant. In this way, it would not be prudent to establish “paradigms” about the behavior of the PFAAs in certain areas or organisms, instead to suggest the points that can be considered fundamental for each issue addressed. The main variables that appear to intervene in estuarine and coastal regions are mainly the proximity to the source of pollution, salinity, pH, precipitation (rain) as well as types of PFAAs. All these can synergistically lead to different impacts on the ecosystem. Therefore, the particular risks of PFAAs in estuarine and coastal regions is a set of multiple variables, dependent on each sampling condition and according to the previously named parameters. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144584,,,

The most commonly studied PFASs are perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Animal studies indicate that maternal PFAS exposure is associated with reduced fetal growth. However, the results of human studies are inconsistent. Objectives: To summarize the evidence of an association between exposure to PFASs, particularly PFOS and PFOA, and human fetal growth. Methods: Systematic literature searches were performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE. We included original studies on pregnant women with measurements of PFOA or PFOS in maternal blood during pregnancy or the umbilical cord and associations with birth weight or related outcomes according to the PFAS level. Citations and references from the included articles were investigated to locate more relevant articles. Study characteristics and results were extracted to structured tables. The completeness of reporting as well as the risk of bias and confounding were assessed. Results: Fourteen studies were eligible. In utero PFOA exposure was associated with decreased measures of continuous birth weight in all studies, even though the magnitude of the association differed and many results were statistically insignificant. PFOS exposure and birth weight were associated in some studies, while others found no association. Conclusions: Higher PFOS and PFOA concentrations were associated with decreased average birth weight in most studies, but only some results were statistically significant.

The relation of PFASs to fertility has now been examined in a relatively large number of epidemiologic studies and a synthesis is in order. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFASs and measures of human fertility, with particular emphasis on perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Systematic literature searches were initially conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE and subsequently in references and citations of included papers. Studies were included if they assessed exposure to PFASs in biological samples in relation to reproductive hormones, semen characteristics, or time to pregnancy (TTP). Study characteristics and results were abstracted to predefined forms, and the studies were assessed for the risk of bias and confounding. Sixteen studies investigated the association between PFAS exposure in men and semen parameters, reproductive hormone levels, or TTP. There was a lack of consistent results among the numerous investigated exposure-outcome combinations. However, subtle associations between higher PFOS and lower testosterone or abnormal semen morphology cannot be excluded. Eleven studies assessed the association between PFAS exposure in women and TTP or reproductive hormones levels. Four of eight studies found prolonged TTP with higher PFOS or PFOA, but only one study found an association when restricting to nulliparous women. In men, there is little evidence of an association between PFAS exposure and semen quality or levels of reproductive hormones.

Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and thyroid outcomes during the early stages of life. We aimed to review this evidence. Methods We conducted a systematic review in compliance with the PRISMA Statement (search conducted in PubMed and Embase, as well as in the citations of the selected articles). We chose studies if they dealt with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin (T4), or thyroid dysfunctions, and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measured in the blood of pregnant women and/or children up to 19 years old. Results We included in this review three cross-sectional, one case-control, and six cohort studies (publication: 2011–2015), focusing on prenatal life (n = 7), childhood (n = 2) or both periods (n = 1). We observed a high degree of heterogeneity across studies in terms of sampling time (different gestational weeks, at birth, or childhood), outcomes, adjustment for potential confounders, and statistical approach. We found some evidence of a positive association between PFHxS and PFOS exposure and TSH levels measured in maternal blood, and PFNA and TSH levels measured in the blood of boys aged ≥ 11 years. Conclusion Although there is a small number of studies with comparable data, we found some consistency of a positive association between maternal or teenage male exposure to some PFAS and TSH levels based on the current literature.

In Western countries, health advisories regarding PFAS exposure have been released to warn the public of its potential adverse effects. However, awareness regarding PFAS exposure in Asia is still at its infancy as reflected by the minimal safeguards imposed to protect the population from exposure. Here, we reviewed studies on PFAS contamination in Asia with a focus on freshwater resources to determine whether PFAS is also a concern in this part of the globe. Peer reviewed articles which included information on PFAS levels from 2000 to 2020 were compiled. The highest PFAS contamination was detected in surface water relative to ground, tap, and drinking water. PFAS levels in water resources in several countries in Asia, such as China, Japan, and South Korea, were above the recommended level, similar to that in the United States. PFAS in South and Southeast Asia were just below the recommended level, but the rise of PFAS in China in the recent decade, alongside its remarkable economic and industrial growth, suggests that increased PFAS contamination in South and Southeast Asia may soon follow, as these countries compete with the global economy. Hence, there is a need for these countries to also implement measures that will reduce the exposure of their population to PFAS. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.envres.2021.111122,Health Resources;Asia,,

In wildlife, changes in the biotic and abiotic environment (e.g. salinity, temperature, reproductive stage, and health status) often lead to dynamic and responsive physiological changes that alter the prevalence and location of many proteins, including PFAS-related proteins. Therefore, we hypothesize that if key PFAS-related proteins are impacted as a result of environmentally induced as well as biologically programmed physiological changes (e.g. reproduction), then PFAS that associate with those proteins will also be impacted. Changes in tissue distribution across tissues of PFAS due to these dynamics may have implications for wildlife studies where these chemicals are measured in biological matrices (e.g., serum, feathers, eggs). For example, failure to account for factors contributing to PFAS variability in a tissue may result in exposure misclassification as measured concentrations may not reflect average exposure levels. The goal of this review is to share general information with the PFAS research community on what biotic and abiotic changes might be important to consider when designing and interpreting a biomonitoring or an ecotoxicity based wildlife study. This review will also draw on parallels from the epidemiological discipline to improve study design in wildlife research. Overall, understanding these connections between biotic and abiotic environments, dynamic protein levels, PFAS levels measured in wildlife, and epidemiology serves to strengthen study design and study interpretation and thus strengthen conclusions derived from wildlife studies for years to come. © 2021","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.envint.2021.107037,,,

This critical review summarizes peer reviewed epidemiological studies on PFOA and cancers of the kidneys and testes, using modified Hill’s criteria to assess the evidence for causation. We converted exposures to a common scale based on serum PFOA concentrations and applied meta-analysis to estimate the average increase in cancer risk reported by the studies with sufficient information to estimate serum PFOA. Using random effects meta-analysis, we found that the average relative increase in cancer risk per 10 ng/mL increase in serum PFOA for these studies is 16% (95% CI: 3%, 30%) for kidney cancer and 3% (95% CI: 2%, 4%) for testicular cancer.

Bats provide essential ecosystem services and a sustained, thriving population is vital for ecosystem health. Understanding issues threatening their survival is crucial for their protection and conservation. This paper provides the first review for 12. years on organic pollutants in bats and aims to investigate trends and any new issues impacting bat resilience. Organochlorine (OC) pesticides have been reported most often, especially in the older literature, with the dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), present at highest concentrations in tissues analyzed. The OC pesticide concentrations reported in bat tissues have declined significantly since the late 1970s, presumably as a result of restrictions in use. For example, DDE study mean concentrations over time periods 1970-1980, 1981-1999 and 2000-2013 ranged from 2.6-62, 0.05-2.31, 0.08-0.19. ppm wet weight, respectively. Exposure, however, still occurs from remaining residues, many years after the compounds have been actively used. In recent years (2000-2013), a range of other organic chemicals have been reported in bat tissues including brominated flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ether at a mean concentration of 2.9. ppm lipid weight) and perfluorinated compounds (perfluorooctanyl sulfonate at a mean concentration 0.09. ppm wet weight). The persistent organic compounds concentrate in tissues with higher fat content notably back-depot fat. Numerous factors influence exposure, residues detected and concentrations in different individuals, species and tissues which must be understood to provide meaningful assessment of the impacts of exposure. Exposure can lead to not only acute and lethal impacts, but also physiological sub-lethal and chronic effects, often linked to the annual cycle of fat deposition and withdrawal. Current challenges for bat conservation include collation of a more extensive and standardized database of bat exposure, especially to current use pesticides and emerging contaminants, and better prediction and definition of toxicity end points notably for the sub-lethal effects. Understanding sub-lethal effects will be of greater importance for sustaining populations in the longer-term. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.envint.2013.10.009,,,

They are structurally diverse but comprise a common chemical feature of at least one (though usually more) perfluorocarbon moiety (–CnF2n–) attached to a functional group such as a carboxylic or sulphonic acid. The strength of the Carbon-Fluorine bond means the compounds do not break down easily and can thus bioaccumulate. PFAS are of high concern to regulators and the public due to their potential toxicity and high persistence. At high exposure levels, PFAS have been implicated in a range of harmful effects on human and environmental health, particularly problems in/with development, cholesterol and endocrine disruption, immune system function, and oncogenesis. However, most environmental toxicology studies use far higher levels of PFAS than are generally found in the environment. Additionally, since the type of exposure, the PFAS used, and the organisms tested all vary between studies, so do the results. Traditional ecotoxicology studies may thus not identify PFAS effects at environmentally relevant exposures. Here we conduct a review of omics-based PFAS exposure studies using laboratory ecotoxicological methodologies and environmentally relevant exposure levels and show that common biochemical response pathways are identified in multiple studies. A major pathway identified was the pentose phosphate shunt pathway.

In this systematic review, we compile published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea superorder and present contamination patterns, exposure effects, and potential human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found batoids to accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Accumulation of POPs is reported for chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

Future research efforts must continue to fill the knowledge gap between placental susceptibility to environmental exposures like PFAS, subsequent perinatal health risks for both mother and child, and latent health effects in adult offspring. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.tox.2020.152565,Placenta,,

Long-term human studies on effects of environmental chemicals on thyroid related outcomes such as growth and development are still lacking. The human exposure scenario with life long exposure to a vast mixture of chemicals in low doses and the large physiological variation in thyroid hormone levels between individuals render human studies very difficult.

PFAAs are hormone-disrupting compounds that are strongly suspected to affect mother-child-health such as fetal growth. Thyroid disruption is a plausible mechanism of action. We aim to summarize the epidemiological evidence for the relation between prenatal and postnatal exposure to PFAAs and disruption of thyroid homeostasis in mothers and/or infants. Method: Fifteen original publications on PFAAs concentrations and thyroid hormones (TH) in pregnant women and/or infants were found upon a literature search in the PubMed database. Information on exposure to seven PFAAs congeners [Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), Perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), Perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA), and Perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA)] and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free and total thyroxine (FT4 and TT4), free and total triiodothyronine (FT3 and TT3), T3RU (Free triiodothyronine resin uptake) and FT4-index (FT4I) levels were recorded. We evaluated sampling of maternal TH by trimester, and infant TH by sex stratification. Reported associations between mother or infant PFAAs and TH were not uniformly assessed in the selected studies. Results: Ten out of the fifteen studies examined maternal PFAAs concentration and TSH level. Seven studies showed significant associations between TSH and exposure to six PFAAs congeners, most of them were positive. Maternal T4 and T3 were investigated in nine studies and five studies found inverse associations between exposure to six PFAAs congeners and TH (TT3, TT4, FT3, FT4 and FT4I) levels. Eight of the fifteen studies investigated PFAAs concentrations and infant TSH. Infant TSH level was significantly affected in four studies, positively in three studies. Nine studies investigated infant T4 and T3 and seven studies found significant associations with PFAAs exposure. However, both inverse and positive significant associations with infant TH were found eliciting no clear direction. Conclusion: Results indicate a mainly positive relationship between maternal PFAAs concentrations and TSH levels, and suggestion of an inverse association with T4 and/or T3 levels.

Yet, the contribution of suspended particles has not been systematically reviewed. Analyzing reported studies, we quantitatively demonstrate that suspended particles in surface water can contain significantly higher concentrations of PFAAs than the sediment below, indicating the source of suspended particles are not the sediment but particles eroded and carried from the source zone upstream. The affinity of PFAAs to particles depends on the particle composition, including organic carbon fraction and iron or aluminum oxide content. In soils, most PFAAs are retained within the top 5 m below the ground surface. The distribution of PFAAs in the subsurface varies based on site properties and local weather conditions. The depth corresponding to the maximum concentration of PFAA in soil decreases with an increase in soil organic carbon or rainfall amount received in the catchment areas. We attribute a greater accumulation of PFAAs near the upper layer of the subsurface to an increase in the accumulation of particles eroded from source zones upstream receiving heavy rainfall. Precursor transformation in the aerobic zone is significantly higher than in the anaerobic zone, thereby making the aerobic subsurface zone serve as a long-term source of groundwater pollution.

Human occupational and community exposure to PFAS has been associated with several cancers, including cancers of the kidney, testis, prostate, and liver. While evidence suggests that PFAS are not directly mutagenic, many diverse mechanisms of carcinogenicity have been proposed. In this mini-review, we organize these mechanisms into three major proposed pathways of PFAS action—metabolism, endocrine disruption, and epigenetic perturbation—and discuss how these distinct but interdependent pathways may explain many of the proposed pro-carcinogenic effects of the PFAS class of environmental contaminants. Notably, each of the pathways is predicted to be highly sensitive to the dose and window of exposure which may, in part, explain the variable epidemiologic and experimental evidence linking PFAS and cancer.

This recent body of work has led to a better understanding of the current levels and spatial and temporal trends of contaminants in biota, including the marine food species that northern peoples traditionally consume. Compared to other circumpolar countries, concentrations of many organochlorines (OCs) in Canadian Arctic marine biota are generally lower than in the European Arctic and eastern Greenland but are higher than in Alaska, whereas Hg concentrations are substantially higher in Canada than elsewhere. Spatial coverage of OCs in ringed seals, beluga and seabirds remains a strength of the Arctic contaminant data set for Canada. Concentrations of OCs in marine mammals and seabirds remain fairly consistent across the Canadian Arctic although subtle differences from west to east and south to north are found in the proportions of various chemicals. The most significant development since 1997 is improvement in the temporal trend data sets, thanks to the use of archived tissue samples from the 1970s and 1980s, long-term studies using archeological material, as well as the continuation of sampling. These data cover a range of species and chemicals and also include retrospective studies on new chemicals such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers. There is solid evidence in a few species (beluga, polar bear, blue mussels) that Hg at some locations has significantly increased from pre-industrial times to the present; however, the temporal trends of Hg over the past 20-30 years are inconsistent. Some animal populations exhibited significant increases in Hg whereas others did not. Therefore, it is currently not possible to determine if anthropogenic Hg is generally increasing in Canadian Arctic biota. It is also not yet possible to evaluate whether the recent Hg increases observed in some biota may be due solely to increased anthropogenic inputs or are in part the product of environmental change, e.g., climate warming. Concentrations of most ""legacy"" OCs (PCBs, DDT, etc.) significantly declined in Canadian Arctic biota from the 1970s to the late 1990s, and today are generally less than half the levels of the 1970s, particularly in seabirds and ringed seals. Chlorobenzenes and endosulfan were among the few OCs to show increases during this period while ∑HCH remained relatively constant in most species. A suite of new-use chemicals previously unreported in Arctic biota (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), perfluoro-octane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs)) has recently been found, but there is insufficient information to assess species differences, spatial patterns or food web dynamics for these compounds. Concentrations of these new chemicals are generally lower than legacy OCs, but there is concern because some are rapidly increasing in concentration (e.g., PBDEs), while others such as PFOS have unique toxicological properties, and some were not expected to be found in the Arctic because of their supposedly low potential for long-range transport. Continuing temporal monitoring of POPs and Hg in a variety of marine biota must be a priority. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This is not fully explained by established risk factors. Concurrent, increasing exposure to antiandrogenic environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in fetal life may partially explain this trend. This systematic review assessed available evidence regarding the association between environmental EDC exposure and risk of testicular cancer (seminomas and nonseminomas). Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of English peer-reviewed literature published prior to December 14, 2020 in the databases PubMed and Embase® was performed. Among the 279 identified records, 19 were eligible for quality assessment and 10 for further meta-analysis. The completeness of reporting was high across papers, but over 50% were considered subject to potential risk of bias. Mean age at diagnosis was 31.9 years. None considered effects of EDC multipollutant mixtures. The meta-analyses showed that maternal exposure to combined EDCs was associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer in male offspring [summary risk ratios: 2.16, (95% CI:1.78-2.62), 1.93 (95% CI:1.49-2.48), and 2.78 (95% CI:2.27-3.41) for all, seminoma, and nonseminoma, respectively]. Similarly, high maternal exposures to grouped organochlorines and organohalogens were associated with higher risk of seminoma and nonseminoma in the offspring. Summary estimates related to postnatal adult male EDC exposures were inconsistent. Maternal, but not postnatal adult male, EDC exposures were consistently associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer, particularly risk of nonseminomas. However, the quality of studies was mixed, and considering the fields complexity, more prospective studies of prenatal EDC multipollutant mixture exposures and testicular cancer are needed. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

PFAS cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. Thus, PFAS are a likely risk for neurotoxicity. Studies that measured PFAS levels in the brains of humans, polar bears, and rats have demonstrated that some areas of the brain accumulate greater amounts of PFAS. Moreover, in humans, there is evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and an increased cause of death from Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease in elderly populations. Given possible links to neurological disease, critical analyses of possible mechanisms of neurotoxic action are necessary to advance the field. This paper critically reviews studies that investigated potential mechanistic causes for neurotoxicity including (1) a change in neurotransmitter levels, (2) dysfunction of synaptic calcium homeostasis, and (3) alteration of synaptic and neuronal protein expression and function. We found growing evidence that PFAS exposure causes neurotoxicity through the disruption of neurotransmission, particularly the dopamine and glutamate systems, which are implicated in age-related psychiatric illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases. Evaluated research has shown there are highly reproduced increased glutamate levels in the hippocampus and catecholamine levels in the hypothalamus and decreased dopamine in the whole brain after PFAS exposure. There are significant gaps in the literature relative to the assessment of the nigrostriatal system (striatum and ventral midbrain) among other regions associated with PFAS-associated neurologic dysfunction observed in humans. In conclusion, evidence suggests that PFAS may be neurotoxic and associated with chronic and age-related psychiatric illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, it is imperative that future mechanistic studies assess the impact of PFAS and PFAS mixtures on the mechanism of neurotransmission and the consequential functional effects. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1021/acs.chemrestox.2c00072,Synaptic Transmission,,

This review summarizes and discusses the patterns and trends of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and mercury in ringed seals (Pusa hispida) and polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in the Eastern Canadian Arctic relative to the rest of the Canadian Arctic. The review provides explanations for these trends and looks at the implications of climate-related changes on contaminants in these marine mammals in a region that has been reviewed little. Presently, the highest levels of total mercury (THg) and the legacy pesticide HCH in ringed seals and polar bears are found in the Western Canadian Arctic relative to other locations. Whereas, highest levels of some legacy contaminants, including ∑ PCBs, PCB 153, ∑ DDTs, p,p′-DDE, ∑ CHLs, ClBz are found in the east (i.e., Ungava Bay and Labrador) and in the Beaufort Sea relative to other locations. The highest levels of recent contaminants, including PBDEs and PFOS are found at lower latitudes. Feeding ecology (e.g., feeding at a higher trophic position) is shaping the elevated levels of THg and some legacy contaminants in the west compared to the east. Spatial and temporal trends for POPs and THg are underpinned by historical loadings of surface ocean reservoirs including the Western Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean. Trends set up by the distribution of water masses across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago are then acted upon locally by on-going atmospheric deposition, which is the dominant contributor for more recent contaminants. Warming and continued decline in sea ice are likely to result in further shifts in food web structure, which are likely to increase contaminant burdens in marine mammals. Monitoring of seawater and a range of trophic levels would provide a better basis to inform communities about contaminants in traditionally harvested foods, allow us to understand the causes of contaminant trends in marine ecosystems, and to track environmental response to source controls instituted under international conventions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.052,Canada;Military Personnel,,

The QuEChERS approach is now rapidly developing beyond its original field of application to analytes other than pesticides, and matrices other than food, such as biological fluids and non-edible plants, including Chinese medicinal plants. Recently, the QuEChERS concept has spread to environmental applications by analyzing not only pesticides but also other compounds of environmental concern in soil, sediments, and water.

Several modeling studies have been conducted in attempt to resolve the dominant transport pathway of PFCs to the arctic-atmospheric transport of precursors versus direct transport via ocean currents. These studies are generally limited by their focus on perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) fluxes to arctic seawater and thus far have only used fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and sulfonamide alcohols as inputs for volatile precursors. There have been many monitoring studies from the North American and European Arctic, however, almost nothing is known about PFC levels from the Russian Arctic. In general, there are very few measurements of PFCs from the abiotic environment. Atmospheric measurements show the widespread occurrence of PFC precursors, FTOHs and perfluorinated sulfonamide alcohols. Further, PFCAs and PFSAs have been detected on atmospheric particles. The detection of PFCAs and PFSAs in snow deposition is consistent with the volatile precursor transport hypothesis. There are very limited measurements of PFCs in seawater. PFOA is generally detected in the greatest concentrations. Additional seawater measurements are needed to validate existing model predications. The bulk of the monitoring efforts in biological samples have focused on the perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs) and sulfonates (PFSAs), although there are very few measurements of PFC precursors. The marine food web has been well studied, particularly the top predators. In contrast, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems have been poorly studied. Studies show that in wildlife perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is generally measured in the highest concentration, followed by either perfluorononanoate (PFNA) or perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnA). However, some whale species show relatively high levels of perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA) and seabirds are typically characterized by high proportions of the C11-C15 PFCAs. PFOA is generally infrequently detected and is present in low concentrations in arctic biota. Food web studies show high bioaccumulation in the upper trophic-level animals, although the mechanism of PFC biomagnification is not understood. Spatial trend studies show some differences between populations, although there are inconsistencies between PFC trends. The majority of temporal trend studies are from the Northern American Arctic and Greenland. Studies show generally increasing levels of PFCs from the 1970s, although some studies from the Canadian Arctic show recent declines in PFOS levels. In contrast, ringed seals and polar bears from Greenland continue to show increasing PFOS concentrations.

This review compiles the toxicity researches of regular and emerging PFCs on classical terrestrial biota i.e. microorganisms, earthworms, and plants. In the soil environment, the bioavailability of PFCs much depends on their adsorption in soil, which is affected by soil properties and PFCs structure. By the exploration of bacterial community richness and structure, the gene expression, the influences of PFCs on soil microorganisms were revealed; while the plants and earthworms manifested the PFCs disruption not only through macroscopic indicators, but also from molecular and metabolite responses. Basically, the addition of PFCs would accelerate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in terrestrial organisms, while the excessive ROS could not be eliminated by the defense system causing oxidative damage.

Several issues, such as different levels and time of exposure and different action across different ages as well as gender, make the study of endocrine disruptors still a challenge. The thyroid is very sensitive to the action of disruptors, and considering the importance of a correct thyroid function for physical and cognitive functioning, addressing this topic should be considered a priority. In this review, we examined the most recent studies, many of them concentrating on maternal and child exposure, conducted to assess the impact of industrial chemicals which showed an influence on thyroid function. So far, the number of studies conducted on that topic is not sufficient to provide solid conclusions and lead to homogeneous guidelines. The lack of uniformity is certainly due to differences in areas and populations examined, the different conditions of exposures and the remarkable inter-subject variability. Nonetheless, the European Commission for Health and Food Safety is implementing recommendations to ensure that substances identified as endocrine disruptors will be withdrawn from the market. © 2017 by the authors.

Due to their extensive use and chemical stability, PFAS are ubiquitous environmental contaminants and as such, form an emerging risk factor for male reproductive health. The long half-lives of PFAS is of particular concern as the propensity to accumulate in biological systems prolong the time taken for excretion, taking years in many cases. Accordingly, there is mounting evidence supporting a negative association between PFAS exposure and an array of human health conditions. However, inconsistencies among epidemiological and experimental findings have hindered the ability to definitively link negative reproductive outcomes to specific PFAS exposure. This situation highlights the requirement for further investigation and the identification of reliable biological models that can inform health risks, allowing sensitive assessment of the spectrum of effects of PFAS exposure on humans. Here, we review the literature on the biological effects of PFAS exposure, with a specific focus on male reproduction, owing to its utility as a sentinel marker of general health. Indeed, male infertility has increasingly been shown to serve as an early indicator of a range of co-morbidities such as coronary, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases. It follows that adverse associations have been established between PFAS exposure and the incidence of testicular dysfunction, including pathologies such as testicular cancer and a reduction in semen quality. We also give consideration to the mechanisms that render the male reproductive tract vulnerable to PFAS mediated damage, and discuss novel remediation strategies to mitigate the negative impact of PFAS contamination and/or to ameliorate the PFAS load of exposed individuals.

PFAS have been detected in the blood, liver, kidney, heart, muscle and brain of various species. Although brain is not a dominant tissue for PFAS accumulation compared to blood and liver, adverse effects of PFAS on brain functions have been identified. Here, we review studies related to the absorption, accumulation, distribution and toxicity of PFAS in the brain. We summarize evidence on two potential mechanisms of PFAS entering the brain: initiating blood-brain barrier (BBB) disassembly through disrupting tight junctions and relying on transporters located at the BBB. PFAS with diverse structures and properties enter and accumulate in the brain with varying efficiencies. Compared to long-chain PFAS, short-chain PFAS may not cross cerebral barriers effectively. According to biomonitoring studies and PFAS exposure experiments, PFAS can accumulate in the brain of humans and wildlife species. With respect to the distribution of PFAS in specific brain regions, the brain stem, hippocampus, hypothalamus, pons/medulla and thalamus are dominant for PFAS accumulation. The accumulation and distribution of PFAS in the brain may lead to toxic effects in the central nervous system (CNS), including PFAS-induced behavioral and cognitive disorders. The specific mechanisms underlying such PFAS-induced neurotoxicity remain to be explored, but two major potential mechanisms based on current understanding are PFAS effects on calcium homeostasis and neurotransmitter alterations in neurons. Based on the information available about PFAS uptake, accumulation, distribution and impacts on the brain, PFAS have the potential to enter and accumulate in the brain at varying levels. The balance of existing studies shows there is some indication of risk in animals, while the human evidence is mixed and warrants further scrutiny.

Thousands of distinct PFAS exist in commerce. The 2019 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Action Plan outlines a multiprogram national research plan to address the challenge of PFAS. One component of this strategy involves the use of systematic evidence map (SEM) approaches to characterize the evidence base for hundreds of PFAS. OBJECTIVE: SEM methods were used to summarize available epidemiological and animal bioassay evidence for a set of ∼ 150 PFAS that were prioritized in 2019 by the U.S. EPA’s Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) for in vitro toxicity and toxicokinetic assay testing. METHODS: Systematic review methods were used to identify and screen literature using manual review and machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify mammalian animal bioassay and epidemiological studies that could inform human hazard identification. A variety of supplemental content was also tracked, including information on in vitro model systems; exposure measurement–only studies in humans; and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Animal bioassay and epidemiology studies meeting PECO criteria were summarized with respect to study design, and health system(s) were assessed. Because animal bioassay studies with ≥21-d exposure duration (or reproductive/developmental study design) were most useful to CCTE analyses, these studies underwent study evaluation and detailed data extraction. All data extraction is publicly available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata. RESULTS: More than 40,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes identified 44 animal and 148 epidemiology studies from the peer-reviewed literature and 95 animal and 50 epidemiology studies from gray literature that met PECO criteria. Epidemiological evidence (available for 15 PFAS) mostly assessed the reproductive, endocrine, developmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Animal evidence (available for 40 PFAS) commonly assessed effects in the reproductive, developmental, urinary, immunological, and hepatic systems. Overall, 45 PFAS had evidence across animal and epidemiology data streams. DISCUSSION: Many of the ∼ 150 PFAS were data poor. Epidemiological and animal evidence were lacking for most of the PFAS included in our search. By disseminating this information, we hope to facilitate additional assessment work by providing the initial scoping literature survey and identifying key research needs. Future research on data-poor PFAS will help support a more complete understanding of the potential health effects from PFAS exposures. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Eighteen epidemiologic studies-eight of PFOA, four of PFOS, and six of both PFOA and PFOS-have estimated associations of exposure to these chemicals with cancer incidence or mortality, with studies equally divided between occupational and nonoccupational settings. Although some statistically significant positive associations have been reported, for example, with cancers of the prostate, kidney, testis, and thyroid, the majority of relative risk estimates for both PFOA and PFOS have been between 0.5 and 2.0 (with 95% confidence intervals including 1.0), inconsistently detected across studies, counterbalanced by negative associations, not indicative of a monotonic exposure-response relationship, and not coherent with toxicological evidence in animals, in which the primary target organs are the liver, testis (Leydig cells), and pancreas (acinar cells). Many positive associations with PFOA exposure were detected in community settings without occupational exposure and were not supported by results in exposed workers. Given that occupational exposure to PFOA and PFOS is one to two orders of magnitude higher than environmental exposure, the discrepant positive findings are likely due to chance, confounding, and/or bias.

Accordingly, this article systematically and critically reviews the epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFOA and PFOS and various immune-related health conditions in humans. Twenty-four epidemiologic studies have reported associations of PFOA and/or PFOS with immune-related health conditions, including ten studies of immune biomarker levels or gene expression patterns, ten studies of atopic or allergic disorders, five studies of infectious diseases, four studies of vaccine responses, and five studies of chronic inflammatory or autoimmune conditions (with several studies evaluating multiple endpoints). Asthma, the most commonly studied condition, was evaluated in seven studies. With few, often methodologically limited studies of any particular health condition, generally inconsistent results, and an inability to exclude confounding, bias, or chance as an explanation for observed associations, the available epidemiologic evidence is insufficient to reach a conclusion about a causal relationship between exposure to PFOA and PFOS and any immune-related health condition in humans.

PFASs, such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and related precursors, have elicited attention from both public and national regulatory agencies, which has resulted in worldwide restrictions on their production and use. Apex predators occupy the top trophic positions in ecosystems and are most affected by the biomagnification behavior of PFASs. Meanwhile, the long lifespans of apex predators also lead to the high body burden of PFASs. The high body burden of PFASs might be linked to adverse health effects and even pose a potential threat to their reproduction. As seen in previous reviews of PFASs, knowledge is lacking between the current stage of the PFAS body burden and related effects in apex predators. This review summarized PFAS occurrence in global apex predators, including information on the geographic distribution, levels, profiles, and tissue distribution, and discussed the trophic transfer and ecotoxicity of PFASs. In the case where legacy PFASs were restricted under international convention, the occurrence of novel PFASs, such as 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) and perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate (PFECHS), in apex predators arose as an emerging issue.

We aim to list and discuss occurrence and treatment efficiencies, develop a new way to characterize mobile compounds by their basic properties, and provide a report of status and research needs on aquatic and multimedia models. The compound groups include selected per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and other compounds. Octanol-water distribution coefficients (D) are calculated for PFAS by an expression including octanol-water partition coefficients (P) and ionization (Ka) constants, and by using Chemicalize.com for multi-protic PPCPs and other compounds. Log D ranges between − 6 and 0 for PFAS and between − 8 and 5 for PPCPs and pesticides. This is significantly lower than the ranges of P for nonpolar compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Many pharmaceuticals and potential endocrine disruptors can be removed effectively in source, finished and distribution supply water through sorption, chemical oxidation, photolysis, and biodegradation. Sediment core profiles of polar organics may not reflect the chronology of their production and use, due to post-depositional mobility of the relatively water-soluble compounds. A novel approach for identifying mobile compounds is developed using sediment records extending downcore past authorization or initiation dates for the compounds. We find that an area limited by log water solubility µmol/L &gt; 4.2 and log D &lt; −0.8 approximately defines an area of mobile compounds here represented by perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA) and atenolol.

Research on organic contaminants (OCs) in biosolids has been undertaken for over thirty years and the increasing body of evidence demonstrates that the majority of compounds studied do not place human health at risk when biosolids are recycled to farmland. However, there are 143,000 chemicals registered in the European Union for industrial use and all could be potentially found in biosolids. Therefore, a literature review of 'emerging' OCs in biosolids has been conducted for a selection of chemicals of potential concern for land application based upon human toxicity, evidence of adverse effects on the environment and endocrine disruption. To identify monitoring and research priorities the selected chemicals were ranked using an assessment matrix approach. Compounds were evaluated based upon environmental persistence, human toxicity, evidence of bioaccumulation in humans and the environment, evidence of ecotoxicity and the number and quality of studies focussed on the contaminant internationally. The identified chemicals of concern were ranked in decreasing order of priority: perfluorinated chemicals (PFOS, PFOA); polychlorinated alkanes (PCAs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs); organotins (OTs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC); benzothiazoles; antibiotics and pharmaceuticals; synthetic musks; bisphenol A, quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), steroids; phthalate acid esters (PAEs) and polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMSs).A number of issues were identified and recommendations for the prioritisation of further research and monitoring of 'emerging' OCs for the agricultural use of biosolids are provided.

A critical review and comparison with regulatory criteria and persistent lipophilic compounds,2008,1,1,,,,,,"Conder J.M., Hoke R.A., De Wolf W., Russell M.H., Buck R.C.",,,,,"Perfluorinated acids, including perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs), and perfluorinated sulfonates (PFASs), are environmentally persistent and have been detected in a variety of wildlife across the globe. The most commonly detected PFAS, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), has been classified as a persistent and bioaccumulative substance. Similarities in chemical structure and environmental behavior of PFOS and the PFCAs that have been detected in wildlife have generated concerns about the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs. Differences between partitioning behavior of perfluorinated acids and persistent lipophilic compounds complicate the understanding of PFCA bioaccumulation and the subsequent classification of the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs according to existing regulatory criteria. Based on available research on the bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids, five key points are highlighted in this review: (1) bioconcentration and bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids are directly related to the length of each compound's fluorinated carbon chain; (2) PFASs are more bioaccumulative than PFCAs of the same fluorinated carbon chain length; (3) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (perfluorooctanoate (PFO) and shorter PFCAs) are not considered bioaccumulative according to the range of promulgated bioaccumulation, ""B"", regulatory criteria of 1000-5000 L/kg; (4) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less have low biomagnification potential in food webs, and (5) more research is necessary to fully characterize the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains (>7 fluorinated carbons), as PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains may exhibit partitioning behavior similar to or greater than PFOS. The bioaccumulation potential of perfluorinated acids with seven fluorinated carbons or less appears to be several orders of magnitude lower than ""legacy"" persistent lipophilic compounds classified as bioaccumulative. Thus, although many PFCAs are environmentally persistent and can be present at detectable concentrations in wildlife, it is clear that PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (including PFO) are not bioaccumulative according to regulatory criteria. © 2008 American Chemical Society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1021/es070895g,,,

They were identified as endocrine disruptors due to their ability to interfere with thyroid function. The resistance of PFOA and PFOS to environmental degradation, their bio-accumulation in food chains, and their long half-life raised concern in the scientific community, and several studies were performed with the aim to establish the real dangerousness of these compounds for the human health. Purpose: The present review will focus on the effects of PFOA and PFOS on the thyroid gland taking into account in vitro experiments, animal studies, and human data. PFOS and PFOA reduce the circulating levels of thyroid hormones in diet-exposed animals, mainly by increasing their metabolic clearance rate. Conclusions: An accumulation of PFOS and PFOA was documented in thyroid cells, and a cytotoxic effect was observed after exposure to extremely high concentrations of these compounds. In environmentally exposed communities and in the general population, the most consistent effect of exposure to PFOA, and to a less extent to PFOS, is the occurrence of hypothyroidism. Women and children appear to be more at risk of developing mild thyroid failure. Pregnant women with circulating thyroid antibodies might be at risk of developing subclinical hypothyroidism, mainly when exposed at high doses of PFOS. The relative risks for thyroid cancer in people exposed to PFOA and PFOS were low and based on a few cases.

These characteristics are useful for the industrial production, however they are also potentially dangerous for human health and for the environment. PFAS are persistent pollutants accumulating in waters and soil and recoverable in foods due to their release by food packaging. Humans are daily exposed to PFAS because these compounds are ubiquitous and, when assimilated, they are difficult to be eliminated, persisting for years both in humans and animals. Due to their persistence and potential danger to health, some old generation PFAS have been replaced by newly synthesized PFAS with the aim to use alternative compounds presumably safer for humans and the environment. Yet, the environmental pollution with PFAS remains a matter of concern worldwide and led to large-scale epidemiological studies both on plants’ workers and on exposed people in the general population. In this context, strong concern emerged concerning the potential adverse effects of PFAS on the thyroid gland. Thyroid hormones play a critical role in the regulation of metabolism, and thyroid function is related to cardiovascular disease, fertility, and fetal neurodevelopment. In vitro, ex vivo data, and epidemiological studies suggested that PFASs may disrupt the thyroid hormone system in humans, with possible negative repercussions on the outcome of pregnancy and fetal-child development. However, data on the thyroid disrupting effect of PFAS remain controversial, as well as their impact on human health in different ages of life. Aim of the present paper is to review recent data on the effects of old and new generation PFAS on thyroid homeostasis.

Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent synthetic chemicals widely used in industry and consumer products and bioaccumulate in food webs and human tissues, such as the liver. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis evaluating PFAS exposure and evidence of liver injury from rodent and epidemiological studies. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched for all studies from earliest available indexing year through 1 December 2021 using keywords corresponding to PFAS exposure and liver injury. For data synthesis, results were limited to studies in humans and rodents assessing the following indicators of liver injury: serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or steatosis. For human studies, at least three observational studies per PFAS were used to conduct a weighted z-score meta-analysis to determine the direction and significance of associations. For rodent studies, data were synthesized to qualitatively summarize the direction and significance of effect. RESULTS: Our search yielded 85 rodent studies and 24 epidemiological studies, primarily of people from the United States. Studies focused primarily on legacy PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid. Meta-analyses of human studies revealed that higher ALT levels were associated with exposure to PFOA (z-score = 6.20, p < 0:001), PFOS (z-score = 3.55, p < 0:001), and PFNA (z-score = 2.27, p = 0:023). PFOA exposure was also associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in humans. In rodents, PFAS exposures consistently resulted in higher ALT levels and steatosis. CONCLUSION: There is consistent evidence for PFAS hepatotoxicity from rodent studies, supported by associations of PFAS and markers of liver function in observational human studies.

This review aims to (1) identify PFAS sources and fate processes relevant to agricultural systems and (2) expand on plant uptake mechanisms and plant responses to PFAS. Recent Findings: The number of PFAS being quantified in studies involving soil, water, and plants is increasing. Transformation of precursors that tend to stay in the rhizosphere can lead to long-term PFAS reservoir to plants. Some PFAS are readily taken up, particularly the shorter-chain PFAS, and can evoke metabolic responses and phytotoxic effects at high concentrations. PFAS translocation from roots to shoots occurs through both active and passive transport mechanisms. Both PFAS uptake and effects vary between and within species. Summary: As new PFAS emerge, it will be necessary to continue expanding the list of PFAS quantified in land-applied media and assessing their accumulation potential in plants. While controlled laboratory or greenhouse studies have merit, comprehensive field studies are needed to provide clarity on PFAS fate and their relative risk in agricultural systems. Field studies should include identifying site-specific PFAS sources, quantifying a broader suite of PFAS and identifying potential precursors, evaluating plant uptake of replacement PFAS, reporting of soil properties and climatic conditions, and assessing risk of impacts to source and irrigation waters.

This concept is a novel approach to chemicals management that determines whether using substances of concern, such as PFAS, is truly essential for a given functionality. To assess the essentiality of a particular use case, three considerations need to be addressed: (1) the function (chemical, end use and service) that the chemical provides in the use case, (2) whether the function is necessary for health and safety and critical for the functioning of society and (3) if the function is necessary, whether there are viable alternatives for the chemical for this particular use. A few illustrative examples of the three-step process are provided for use cases of PFAS. The essential-use concept takes chemicals management away from a substance-by-substance approach to a group approach. For PFAS and other substances of concern, it offers a more rapid pathway toward effective management or phase-out. Parts of the concept of essential use have already been widely applied in global treaties and international regulations and it has also been recently used by product manufacturers and retailers to phase out substances of concern from supply chains.

In this paper we review various grouping strategies that could be used to inform actions on these chemicals and outline the motivations, advantages and disadvantages for each. Grouping strategies are subdivided into (1) those based on the intrinsic properties of the PFAS (e.g. persistence, bioaccumulation potential, toxicity, mobility, molecular size) and (2) those that inform risk assessment through estimation of cumulative exposure and/or effects. The most precautionary grouping approach of those reviewed within this article suggests phasing out PFAS based on their high persistence alone (the so-called ""P-sufficient""approach). The least precautionary grouping approach reviewed advocates only grouping PFAS for risk assessment that have the same toxicological effects, modes and mechanisms of action, and elimination kinetics, which would need to be well documented across different PFAS. It is recognised that, given jurisdictional differences in chemical assessment philosophies and methodologies, no one strategy will be generally acceptable. The guiding question we apply to the reviewed grouping strategies is: grouping for what purpose? The motivation behind the grouping (e.g. determining use in products vs. setting guideline levels for contaminated environments) may lead to different grouping decisions.

In this paper, we argue that the higher the persistence of a chemical, the greater the emphasis that it should be given in chemicals assessment and decision making. We provide case studies for three classes of highly persistent chemicals (chlorofluorocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) to exemplify problems unique to highly persistent chemicals, despite their otherwise diverse properties. Many well-known historical chemical pollution problems were the result of the release of highly persistent chemicals. Using evaluative modeling calculations, we demonstrate that if a chemical is highly persistent, its continuous release will lead to continuously increasing contamination irrespective of the chemical's physical-chemical properties. We argue that these increasing concentrations will result in increasing probabilities of the occurrence of known and unknown effects and that, once adverse effects are identified, it will take decades, centuries or even longer to reverse contamination and therefore effects. Based on our findings we propose that high persistence alone should be established as a sufficient basis for regulation of a chemical, which we term the ""P-sufficient approach"". We argue that regulation on high persistence alone is not over-precautionary given the historical and ongoing problems that persistent chemicals have caused. Regulation of highly persistent chemicals, for example by restriction of emissions, would not only be precautionary, but would serve to prevent poorly reversible future impacts. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1039/c8em00515j,,,

Despite these early warnings, the problems of groundwater, and thus drinking water, contaminated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) including PFOS are only beginning to be addressed. It is clear that this PFAS contamination is poorly reversible and that the societal costs of clean-up will be high. This inability to reverse exposure in a reasonable timeframe is a major motivation for application of the precautionary principle in chemicals management. We conclude that exposure can be poorly reversible; 1) due to slow elimination kinetics in organisms, or 2) due to poorly reversible environmental contamination that leads to continuous exposure. In the second case, which is relevant for contaminated groundwater, the reversibility of exposure is not related to the magnitude of a chemical's bioaccumulation potential. We argue therefore that all PFASs entering groundwater, irrespective of their perfluoroalkyl chain length and bioaccumulation potential, will result in poorly reversible exposures and risks as well as further clean-up costs for society. To protect groundwater resources for future generations, society should consider a precautionary approach to chemicals management and prevent the use and release of highly persistent and mobile chemicals such as PFASs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.envint.2016.04.044,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances appear to reduce breastfeeding duration through impaired mammary gland development, lactogenesis, and suppressed endocrine signaling. Halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons have differing associations with lactation duration, likely because of the variety of signaling pathways that they affect, pointing to the importance of complex mixtures in epidemiologic studies. Although epidemiologic literature suggests that pesticides and fungicides decrease or have no effect on lactation duration, toxicology literature suggests enhanced mammary gland development through estrogenic and/or antiandrogenic pathways. Toxicological studies suggest that phthalates may affect mammary gland development via estrogenic pathways but no association with lactation duration has been observed. Bisphenol A was associated with decreased duration of breastfeeding, likely through direct and indirect action on estrogenic pathways. SUMMARY: EDCs play a role in mammary gland development, function, and lactogenesis, which can affect breastfeeding duration. Further research should explore direct mechanisms of EDCs on lactation, the significance of toxicant mixtures, and transgenerational effects of EDCs on lactation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1097/MED.0000000000000577,Breast Feeding,,

The properties that made PFAS into an industrial success also led to their persistence and bioaccumulation. As PFAS were widely used for many decades their presence is evident globally, and their persistence and potential for toxicity create concern for human, animal and environmental health. Following the precautionary principle, a reduction in human exposure is generally recommended. The most significant source of human exposure to PFAS is dietary intake (food and water) with additional exposure via dust. As PFAS concentrations have been more frequently studied in aquatic food sources, there is less understanding of exposure via terrestrial animals. To further define human exposure via animal products, it is necessary to determine PFAS concentrations and persistence in terrestrial livestock and game species. Studies assessing ambient concentrations of PFAS have noted that, aside from point sources of contamination, there is generally low input of PFAS into terrestrial agricultural food chains. However, livestock and game species may be exposed to PFAS via contaminated water, soil, substrate, air or food, and the contribution of these exposures to PFAS concentrations in food products is less well studied. This review focuses on perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAAs) and compiles information from terrestrial livestock and game species as a source of dietary exposure in humans, and discusses toxicokinetics and health effects in animals, while identifying future focus areas.

This is the first review where highly referred articles on PFAS used for policymaking by several regulatory agencies were collected and evaluated based on the review guidelines developed by the US National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) review guidelines. Several limitations were observed, including co-exposure to multiple chemicals and limited measurement of primary and secondary outcomes related to specific toxicity. However, data from all the studies provided a moderate to strong level of confidence for link between PFAS exposure and different adverse outcomes. Secondly, for translating the risk to humans, an in-silico model and scaling approach was utilized. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK) was used to calculate the human equivalent dose (HED) from two widely accepted studies and compared with tolerable daily intakes (TDIs) established by various regulatory agencies. Inter-species dose extrapolation was done to compare with human the relevance of dosing scenarios used in animals.

Previous epidemiological studies suggest association of maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes, while evidences about the association are inconsistent. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the relationship of maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Twenty-one relevant studies were identified from three databases before 2020. The quality, heterogeneity and possibility of publication bias of included studies were evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, Q-statistic and Begg's test, respectively. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained by means of random-effects meta-analysis models. Meta-analysis results revealed that maternal exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) may have a positive association with preterm birth (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.38). The pooled estimates also showed limited evidence of association between maternal perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure and miscarriage (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 0.92, 2.38) with obvious heterogeneity (I2 = 93.9, p &lt; 0.01). However, no such significant associations were found between the other PFASs and miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth. In addition, the subgroup analyses showed that studies on the relationship of maternal PFASs exposure and miscarriage were mainly contributed by developed countries. The meta-analysis results indicated maternal exposure to PFOS can increase the risk of preterm birth. The results of the included studies are inconsistent and the effects of PFASs on human health are complex. Further studies with enough samples are required to verify these findings. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146984,Maternal Exposure;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Outcome,,

These compounds can trigger biological activity by activating the alpha isotype of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate gene expression; however, some biological effects may occur independently of the receptor. Activation of the peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor alpha (PPARα) modulates lipid and glucose homeostasis, cell proliferation and differentiation, and inflammation. Reported immunomodulation in experimental animals exposed to PFOA and PFOS has included altered inflammatory responses, production of cytokines and other proteins, reduced lymphoid organ weights, and altered antibody synthesis. Mounting experimental animal evidence suggests PPARα independence of some immune effects. This evidence originates primarily from studies with PPARα knockout models exposed to PFOA that demonstrate hepatic peroxisome proliferation, reduced lymphoid organ weights, and altered antibody synthesis. As human PPARα expression is significantly less than that of rodents, potential PPARα independence indicates that future research must explore mechanisms of action of these compounds, including PPARα -dependent and -independent pathways.

EDs mimic naturally occurring hormones like estrogens and androgens which can in turn interfere with the endocrine system. As a consequence, EDs affect human reproduction as well as post and pre-natal development. In fact, infants can be affected already at prenatal level due to maternal exposure to EDs. In particular, great attention has been given to those chemicals, or their metabolites, that have estrogenic properties or antagonistic effects on the activity of androgen or even inhibiting their production. These compounds have therefore the potential of interfering with important physiological processes, such as masculinization, morphological development of the urogenital system and secondary sexual traits. Animal and in vitro studies have supported the conclusion that endocrine-disrupting chemicals affect the hormone-dependent pathways responsible for male gonadal development, either through direct interaction with hormone receptors or via epigenetic and cell-cycle regulatory modes of action. In human populations, epidemiological studies have reported an overall decline of male fertility and an increased incidence of diseases or congenital malformations of the male reproductive system. The majority of studies point towards an association between exposure to EDs and male and/or female reproductive system disorders, such as infertility, endometriosis, breast cancer, testicular cancer, poor sperm quality and/or function. Despite promising discoveries, a causal relationship between the reproductive disorders and exposure to specific toxicants has yet to be established, due to the complexity of the clinical protocols used, the degree of occupational or environmental exposure, the determination of the variables measured and the sample size of the subjects examined. Despite the lack of consistency in the results of so many studies investigating endocrine-disrupting properties of many different classes of chemicals, the overall conclusion points toward a positive association between exposure to EDs and reproductive system. Future studies should focus on a uniform systems to examine human populations with regard to the exposure to specific EDs and the direct effect on the reproductive system. © 2019 The Author(s).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: full text checked",10.1186/s12958-018-0449-4,Self-Fertilization,,

Two of them, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are the most known and well investigated. As for many other organic substances that are of environmental concern, the diet is the main route of human exposure to PFAS. However, in certain cases drinking water may also mean a significant contribution to human exposure, and to a lesser extent, dust and air (indoor exposure). In recent years, the environmental persistence of PFAS, their biomagnification in food webs, as well as their potential accumulation and toxicity, have generated a notable interest, which has been evidenced by the considerable number of publications in this regard. Recently, we carried out a wide revision on the levels of PFAS in food and human dietary intake. In the current review, we have summarized the recent information (last 10 years) published in the scientific literature (Scopus and PubMed) on the concentrations of PFAS in drinking water and the human health risks derived from the regular water consumption, when available. A large amount of data belongs to PFOS and PFOA and corresponds to studies mainly conducted in countries of the European Union, USA and China, although no information is available for most countries over the world.

Environmental toxicants, especially those that disrupt normal placental and endothelial function, are emerging as potential risk factors for HDP. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large group of ubiquitous chemicals found in consumer products, the environment, and increasingly in drinking water. PFAS have been associated with a multitude of adverse health effects, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, and more recently, HDP. In this review, we present epidemiological and mechanistic evidence for the link between PFAS and HDP and recommend next steps for research and prevention efforts. To date, epidemiological studies have assessed associations between only ten of the thousands of PFAS and HDP. Positive associations between six PFAS (PFOA, perfluorooctanoic acid; PFOS, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid; PFHxS, perfluorohexane sulfonic acid; PFHpA, perfluoroheptanoic acid; PFBS, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid; and PFNA, perfluoronanoic acid) and risk for HDP have been reported in some, but not all, studies. PFAS disrupt placental and immune function, cause oxidative stress, and disrupt lipid metabolism. These physiological disruptions may be mechanisms through which PFAS can lead to HDP. Overall, limited epidemiological evidence and plausible mechanisms support PFAS as risk factors for HDP. More research is needed in diverse, well-powered cohorts that assess exposures to as many PFAS as possible. Such research should consider not only individual PFAS but also the totality of exposures to PFAS and other environmental chemicals. Pregnant women may be a group that is vulnerable to PFAS exposure, and as such HDP risk should be considered by policymakers setting PFAS exposure limits. In the interim, medical and public health professionals in regions with PFAS contamination could provide short-term solutions in the form of patient-level prevention, increased monitoring, and early intervention for HDP. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.envres.2021.111113,Pregnancy;Environmental Exposure;Risk Factors,,

rayyan-421820370,Persistent organic pollutants and metals in the freshwater biota of the Canadian Subarctic and Arctic: An overview,2005,1,1,,,,,,"Evans M.S., Muir D., Lockhart W.L., Stern G., Ryan M., Roach P.",,,,,"Over 1999-2002, an extensive series of contaminant studies was conducted on freshwater biota of Canada's Arctic and Subarctic regions. The majority of inorganic contaminant studies focused on mercury and fish. While mercury concentrations were low in benthic feeding fish such as whitefish, predatory fish such as lake trout, pike, and walleye frequently had mercury levels which exceeded 0.2 μg/g, the consumption guideline for frequent consumers of fish, and 0.5 μg/g, the guideline for the commercial use of fish. Numerous consumption advisories were issued for lakes along the Mackenzie River. Relatively high mercury levels appear to be due to a combination of relatively old fish populations (because of light fishing pressures) and tend to be more prevalent in smaller lakes where warmer summer water temperatures and watershed influences result in greater mercury and methyl mercury inputs. Mercury levels were substantially lower in char than in lake trout, possibly due to a combination of a less fish-rich diet, a colder environment, and smaller MeHg watershed inputs. Less research has been conducted on other metals but some, such as rubidium, show pronounced variations in concentration that may be related to geological influences. Temporal trend monitoring has revealed little evidence of declining mercury levels in fish that can be attributed to declining atmospheric inputs. Because mercury follows complex pathways in the environment, other factors may operate to counteract reductions in atmospheric mercury sources, e.g., climatic variability, changes in the commercial fishery, and interactions between fish species. Most organochlorine (OC) investigations were based on long term trend monitoring and focused on char (Cornwallis Island), burbot (Great Slave Lake, Yukon lakes, Slave River at Fort Smith, Mackenzie River at Fort Good Hope) and lake trout (Yukon lakes, Great Slave Lake). There was strong evidence of declining OC concentrations in char, particularly ΣHCH and Σchlordane, which may reflect a response to declining atmospheric inputs. Endosulfan concentrations increased, as in the atmosphere. There also was evidence of declining OC concentrations in burbot in the Slave and Mackenzie rivers but not in Great Slave Lake and Yukon lakes. OC concentrations decreased in lake trout in Yukon lakes in the 2000s, most probably because of changes in the fish themselves (i.e., reduced lipid content, condition factor) and possibly climatic variability. Similarly, OCs declined in Great Slave Lake trout. New research on PDBEs and perfluorinated compounds determined that these contaminants are widespread in freshwater fish and concentrations may be increasing. Global warming is a major issue of concern for Arctic and Subarctic waters and may have adverse impacts on contaminant levels in fish and other biota. There is a need for contaminant studies in the north to be broadened to investigate climatic effects. In addition, monitoring studies should be broadened to consider factors affecting other aspects of fish biology. Foremost among these is integrating contaminant monitoring studies on lakes such as Lake Laberge and Great Slave Lake with stock assessment studies. Ecosystem based studies should be conducted on Great Slave Lake and Lake Laberge to more effectively understand contaminant trends and should consider inputs (atmospheric, river inflow, resupension), losses (sedimentation, volatilization), and biological pathways.

The goals of the present review are to assess the state of the science regarding toxicological effects of PFAS and to develop strategies for advancing knowledge on the health effects of this large family of chemicals. Currently, much of the toxicity data available for PFAS are for a handful of chemicals, primarily legacy PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate. Epidemiological studies have revealed associations between exposure to specific PFAS and a variety of health effects, including altered immune and thyroid function, liver disease, lipid and insulin dysregulation, kidney disease, adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes, and cancer. Concordance with experimental animal data exists for many of these effects. However, information on modes of action and adverse outcome pathways must be expanded, and profound differences in PFAS toxicokinetic properties must be considered in understanding differences in responses between the sexes and among species and life stages. With many health effects noted for a relatively few example compounds and hundreds of other PFAS in commerce lacking toxicity data, more contemporary and high-throughput approaches such as read-across, molecular dynamics, and protein modeling are proposed to accelerate the development of toxicity information on emerging and legacy PFAS, individually and as mixtures.

Globally, regulators and researchers seek to identify the organic fluorinated compounds associated with potential adverse effects, bioaccumulation, mobility, and persistence to manage their risks, and, to understand the beneficial attributes they bring to products such as first responder gear, etc. Clarity is needed to determine the best analytical method for the goal of the analyses (e.g., pure research or analysis to determine the extent of an accidental release, monitoring groundwater for specific compounds to determine regulatory compliance, and establish baseline levels in a river of organic fluorinated substances associated with human health risk prior to a clean-up effort). Analytical techniques that identify organic fluorine coupled together with targeted chemical analysis will yield information sufficient to identify public health or environmental hazards.

Based on this target error of 25%, a statistical model using z-scores was applied to assess the performance of analytical laboratories for POPs and a number of matrices. Since the second round of these ‘Bi-ennial Global Interlaboratory Assessment on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)’, carried out in 2012/2013, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been included into the proficiency tests. The third round was carried out in 2016/2017. The test materials included test solutions of PFASs analytical standards, the abiotic matrices sediment, air (extract) and water and the biotic matrices fish, human milk and human plasma. The number of laboratories submitting results for PFASs remained quite stable (IL2 = 27 laboratories; IL3 = 29), but there was broader geographic distribution observed in IL3: in addition to the laboratories from Asia and the Western Europe/other groups, two laboratories from Africa participated, two from Central-Eastern Europe and one from the Latin American/Caribbean region. Considering that PFASs were introduced for the first time in round 2, the results were good to reasonable compared to those of a number of other POPs included in the same study. However, it shall also be mentioned that for some matrices and PFASs, the number of laboratories submitting results was too small and the results too scattered to derive a consensus value. This was especially true for the PFOS precursor compounds and the air matrix. Also, laboratories struggle with the analysis of the branched PFOS isomers. These interlaboratory assessments on PFASs gave promising results and demonstrated the importance of proficiency tests in an international environment to generate trust in laboratory results. The need to participate regularly in such intercomparison assessments is highlighted. The results show the current level of PFAS analysis, which varies by laboratory and by matrix rather than per geographic region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.trac.2019.03.023,,,

It is known that various PFAS are quantifiable in human in blood, but potential adverse health outcomes remain unclear. Sentinel and non-traditional model species are useful to study potential toxicity of PFAS in order to understand the relationship between environmental and human health. Here, we present a critical review of studies on the neurotoxicity of PFAS in sentinel and non-traditional laboratory model systems, including Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode), Dugesia japonica (planarian), Rana pipiens (frogs), Danio rerio and Oryzias melastigma (fish), and Ursus maritimus (polar bears). PFAS have been implicated in developmental neurotoxicity in non-traditional and traditional model systems as well as sentinel species, including effects on neurotransmitter levels, especially acetylcholine and its metabolism. However, further research on the mechanisms of toxicity needs to be conducted to determine if these chemicals are affecting organisms in a similar manner. Overall, findings tend to be similar among the various species, but bioaccumulation may vary, which needs to be taken into account in future studies by quantifying target organ concentrations of PFAS to better compare different species. Furthermore, data on the majority of PFAS is lacking in neurotoxicity testing, and additional studies are needed to corroborate findings thus far. © 2020 by the authors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.3390/TOXICS8020042,Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

PFCs are non-biodegradable and bioaccumulate in the environment and for these reasons they have been a major subject of research regarding their toxicity, environmental fate, and sources of human exposure, since they have been shown to induce severe health consequences, such as neonatal mortality, neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity. The aim of this review is to explore the existing knowledge of the interplay between PFCs exposure and human health, with a focus on male reproductive health, given the emerging gender differences in PFCs clearance and their interaction with sex hormones receptors. A comprehensive PUBMED search was performed using relevant key terms for PFCs and male fertility. Different degrees of evidence suggest an impairment of semen parameters and sex hormones in relation to PFCs exposure. These preliminary results point towards a sex-dependent pharmacodynamics and clearance, with males having a much higher tendency to accumulation. Moreover, because of the widespread environmental occurrence of these chemicals, along with their ability to cross the placental barrier, exposure of the foetus to these compounds is inevitable. This is of concern because foetal development of the male reproductive organs may be disturbed by exposure to exogenous factors. These findings clearly suggest an antiandrogenic potential of PFCs and a link between endocrine disruptors and disorders of male health. © 2017, Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s40618-017-0790-z,Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

Rodent studies show reverse effects, i.e. decreased blood cholesterol and triglycerides, occurring however at PFAS serum levels at least 100-fold higher than those in humans. This paper aims to present the main issues regarding the modulation of lipid homeostasis by the two most common PFASs, PFOS and PFOA, with emphasis on the underlying mechanisms relevant for humans. Overall, the apparent contrast between human and animal data may be an artifact of dose, with different molecular pathways coming into play upon exposure to PFASs at very low versus high levels. Altogether, the interpretation of existing rodent data on PFOS/PFOA-induced lipid perturbations with respect to the human situation is complex. From a mechanistic perspective, research on human liver cells shows that PFOS/PFOA activate the PPARα pathway, whereas studies on the involvement of other nuclear receptors, like PXR, are less conclusive. Other data indicate that suppression of the nuclear receptor HNF4α signaling pathway, as well as perturbations of bile acid metabolism and transport might be important cellular events that require further investigation. Future studies with human-relevant test systems would help to obtain more insight into the mechanistic pathways pertinent for humans. These studies shall be designed with a careful consideration of appropriate dosing and toxicokinetics, so as to enable biologically plausible quantitative extrapolations.

rayyan-421820423,How reliable are field-derived biomagnification factors and trophic magnification factors as indicators of bioaccumulation potential? Conclusions from a case study on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances,2016,1,1,,,,,,Franklin J.,,,,,"This review examines the usefulness of the metrics BMF (biomagnification factor) and TMF (trophic magnification factor), derived from field measurements of the levels of contaminants in naturally occurring biota, for characterizing the bioaccumulation potential (""B"") of chemicals. Trophic magnification factor and BMF values greater than 1.0 are often considered to be the most conclusive indicators of B status, and the TMF criterion has been referred to as the ""gold standard"" for B categorization. Although not wishing to dispute the theoretical primacy of field-derived BMFs and TMFs as B metrics, we make the case that, in practice, the study-to-study (and even within-study) variability of the results is so great that they are of very restricted usefulness for assessing B status, at least in the case of the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), on which we focus here. This conclusion is based on an analysis of the results of 24 peer-reviewed studies reporting field-derived BMFs or TMFs for 14 PFASs, for which BMF values often range over several orders of magnitude from ≪1.0 to ≫1.0, sometimes even in the same study. For TMFs, the range is a factor of approximately 20 for the most intensely studied PFASs (perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA] and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid [PFOS]). We analyze the possible causes for such variability: To some extent it results from the differing ways in which the metrics are expressed, but most of the scatter is likely attributable to such factors as nonachievement of the tacitly assumed steady-state conditions, uncertainties in the feeding ecology, the impact of metabolism of precursor compounds, and so forth. As more trustworthy alternatives to field-derived BMFs and TMFs, we suggest the implementation of dietary BMF studies performed under strictly controlled conditions on aquatic, terrestrial, and avian species, as well as the consideration of measured elimination half-lives, which have been demonstrated to be directly related to BMF values. © 2015 The Author.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1002/ieam.1642,,,

The design of this study is a literature review. The scientific literature concerning BC were reviewed, especially focusing on the Arctic and the special conditions that exist in this region. Breast cancer incidence is increasing all over the world, including in the Arctic. The enormous transition in health conditions and lifestyle in the Arctic might be contributing to the known risk factors. In Greenland, the age at menarche has diminished by 3 years during the course of 100 years, and the number of children per women as well as the duration of breastfeeding is decreasing. Obesity and intake of saturated fat is increasing and the intake of traditional food rich in unsaturated fat and vitamin D decreasing. Smoking and alcohol consumption in the Arctic has been relatively high but is now decreasing. More focus on genetic susceptibility in relation to BC has identified the specific BRCA1 founder mutation in the Greenlandic population, which might appear to be an important risk factor. However, the known established risk factors alone cannot account for the increasing trend observed. Studies suggest that environmental contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) including perfluorinated compounds increase the risk of BC possibly in conjunction with certain genetic polymorphisms involved in carcinogen activation. The lipophilic POPs such as polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides are found at very high levels in the Arctic population. Several factors can explain the increasing incidence of BC in the Arctic. The transition in lifestyle and health conditions unfortunately increases the known risk factors of BC. Moreover, the population of the Arctic might show up to be especially vulnerable because of the contemporary high burden of POPs and genetic susceptibility. © 2012 Stine Overvad Fredslund and Eva Cecilie Bonefeld-Jørgensen.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: full text checked",10.3402/ijch.v71i0.19155,Breast Neoplasms,,

The analysis of the intrinsic effects of perfluorinated organic surfactants shows the group to have a characteristic overall picture: - high polarity - high thermal and chemical stability - ubiquitous distribution - non-biodegradability - multiple toxicity In addition, certain substances belonging to this group (e.g. PFOS) exhibit a very long retention time in the human body. Toxic properties vary and, like the mechanisms for global distribution, have not been fully clarified. In the meantime, individual members of this substance group have been (are being) removed from the market. This report shows that in future the planned EU chemicals law (REACH) can be used to prevent such substances being regulated after they have been distributed in the environment and thus after damage has already occurred. To this end, however, the requirements for registration for low tonnage substances (1-10 tonnes/a) must be supplemented with specific tests (in particular on biodegradability). Aim and Scope. The aim of the work was to analyse the intrinsic properties and risks of a subgroup of fluorinated organic substances. Results. A summarising article describes the toxic effects and properties of a group of substances selected from the approximately 30,000 existing substances. With regard to the ongoing debate on revising the European regulations of existing substances (REACH), it is apparent that standardised test requirements cannot be applied to impact and risk analyses which are at times highly complex. For governments, REACH only provides the starting points for this process in the form of prescribed standard tests. If a substance (or a substance group) draws attention, more detailed tests must be carried out by the industry itself in the framework of responsible care and in the framework of the evaluation step of REACH. It is therefore important that the standard requirements of REACH are selected appropriately. In this respect, the study reveals some serious deficiencies in the Commission proposal. Conclusion. The standard information for low tonnage substances (1-10 tonnes/a) must be supplemented in particular with an obligatory test on biodegradability. The possibility provided by the REACH dossier to evaluate substances on the basis of group observations (SAR, QSAR e.g.) is to be welcomed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1065/uwsf2005.01.093,Surface-Active Agents;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,,

Because of their persistence and their potential to accumulate they are of toxicological concern. The present review presents the current knowledge of PFC monitoring data in environmental media relevant for human exposure. In this context, PFC concentrations in indoor and ambient air, house dust, drinking water and food are outlined. Furthermore, we summarize human biomonitoring data of PFC levels in blood, breast milk, and human tissues. An estimate of the overall exposure of the general adult population is provided and compared with tolerable intake values. Using a simplified model, the average (and upper) level of daily exposure including all potential routes amounts to 1.6 ng/kgbody weight (8.8 ng/kgbody weight) for PFOS and 2.9 ng/kgbody weight (12.6 ng/kgbody weight) for PFOA in adults in the general population. The majority of exposure can be attributed to the oral route, mainly to diet. Overall, the contribution of PFOS and PFOA precursors to total exposure seems to be limited. Besides this background exposure of the general population, a specific additional exposure may occur which causes an increased PFC body burden. This has been observed in populations living near PFC production facilities or in areas with environmental contamination of PFCs. The consumption of highly contaminated fish products may also cause an increase in PFC body burdens. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Currently, data on the associations between exposure to POPs and the risk of mortality in the U.S. population is limited. Our objective was to determine if higher exposure to POPs is associated with greater risk of all-cause, cancer, heart/cerebrovascular disease, or other-cause mortality. Methods: Analyses included participants aged 60 years and older from the 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). We included 483 participants for analyses of PBDEs, 1043 for PFASs, and 461 for PCBs, and 1428 for OC pesticides. Exposures to POPs were estimated using biomarkers measured in serum. Mortality status through December 31, 2011 was obtained from public-use, linked mortality files. We used Cox proportional hazard models to quantify the associations of interest. Where we observed an association, we explored effect modification by sex, body mass index, smoking status, and albuminuria. We also explored the combined effect of PBDEs and OC pesticides in the subsample of participants with measures of both analytes. Results: Serum measurements of PBDEs, PFASs, and PCBs were not clearly associated with increased all-cause or cause-specific mortality in older Americans. Beta-hexachlorocyclohexane was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality [HR per 1 SD increase =1.18, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.38]. Oxychlordane [HR = 1.15 95% CI 1.06, 1.25], p,p'-DDE [HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.23], trans-nonachlor [HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.18], and beta-hexachlorocyclohexane [HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.52] were associated with increased risk of other-cause mortality. Exploratory analyses suggested associations between OC pesticides and other-cause mortality were modified by sex. Exploratory analyses also suggested that the combination of high PBDE and high OC pesticide exposure had a stronger than expected adverse effect on all-cause mortality. Conclusion: Higher exposure to beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, an OC pesticide, is associated with increased all-cause mortality and higher exposure to four OC pesticides is associated with increased non-cancer, non-heart/cerebrovascular disease mortality in U.S. adults 60 years or older.

This paper summarizes results from that program from 1998 to 2003 with respect to terrestrial animals in the Canadian Arctic. The arctic terrestrial environment has few significant contaminant issues, particularly when compared with freshwater and marine environments. Both current and historical industrial activities in the north may have a continuing effect on biota in the immediate area, but effects tend to be localized. An investigation of arctic ground squirrels at a site in the Northwest Territories that had historically received applications of DDT concluded that DDT in arctic ground squirrels livers was the result of contamination and that this is an indication of the continuing effect of a local point source of DDT. Arsenic concentrations were higher in berries collected from areas around gold mines in the Northwest Territories than from control sites, suggesting that gold mining may significantly affect arsenic levels in berries in the Yellowknives Dene traditional territory. Although moose and caribou from the Canadian Arctic generally carry relatively low contaminant burdens, Yukon moose had high renal selenium concentrations, and moose and some woodland caribou from the same area had high renal cadmium levels, which may put some animals at risk of toxicological effects. Low hepatic copper levels in some caribou herds may indicate a shortage of copper for metabolic demands, particularly for females. Similarities in patterns of temporal fluctuations in renal element concentrations for moose and caribou suggest that environmental factors may be a major cause of fluctuations in renal concentrations of some elements. Concentrations of persistent organochlorines and metals in beaver and muskrat from the Northwest Territories, and carnivores from across the Canadian Arctic were very low and considered normal for terrestrial wildlife. Two new classes of persistent fluorinated contaminants, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) were found in arctic carnivores and were most abundant in arctic fox and least abundant in mink. Although trace element concentrations in king and common eider ducks were low and not of toxicological concern, the number of nematode parasites in common eiders was positively correlated with total and organic mercury concentrations. Future research should focus on cadmium in moose and caribou, mercury in caribou, and emerging contaminants, with an effort to sample moose and caribou annually where possible to explore the role of naturally occurring cycles in apparent temporal trends. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

More important, these signaling proteins were also shown to be involved in modulating testis function based on studies in rodents. Collectively, these findings suggest that toxicants are using similar mechanisms that used to support spermatogenesis under physiological conditions to perturb Sertoli and testis function. These observations are physiologically significant, since a manipulation on the expression of these signaling proteins can possibly be used to manage the toxicant-induced male reproductive dysfunction.

The pooled results demonstrated that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure during pregnancy was linearly associated with increased preterm birth risk (pooled OR per 1-ng/ml increase: 1.01, 95% CIs: 1.00–1.02, P = 0.009) and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) exposure showed inverted U-shaped associations with preterm birth risk (P values for the nonlinear trend: 0.025 and 0.030). Positive associations were also observed for exposure to perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) and miscarriage (pooled OR per 1-ng/ml increase: 1.87, 95% CIs: 1.15–3.03) and PFOS and preeclampsia (pooled OR per 1-log increase: 1.27, 95% CIs: 1.06–1.51), whereas exposure to perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA) was inversely associated with preeclampsia risk (pooled OR per 1-log increase: 0.81, 95% CIs: 0.71–0.93). Based on individual evidence, detrimental effects were observed between PFDA exposure and small for gestational age and between PFOA and PFOS and intrauterine growth restriction. No significant associations were found between pregnancy PFAS exposure and other adverse pregnancy outcomes (i.e., gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced hypertension, low birth weight, and large and small for gestational age). Interpretation: Our findings indicated that PFOS, PFOA and PFNA exposure during pregnancy might be associated with increased preterm birth risk and that PFAS exposure might be associated with the risk of miscarriage and preeclampsia. Due to the limited evidence obtained for most associations, additional studies are required to confirm these findings. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.envres.2021.111632,Pregnancy,,

The release of PFAS from e-waste processing sites and storage landfills into wastewaters was reviewed. It appears that e-waste materials in landfills serve as important nodes for PFAS diffusion to water, soil, hence exerting ecotoxicity on exposed human populations. Evidence from cross-sectional, case-control, and longitudinal studies show that co-occurrence of PFAS and other e-waste toxicants in body fluids and organs of humans act synergistically in causing several health disorders.

Recent Findings: Of 37 eligible epidemiological studies among vulnerable populations published between January 2018 and April 2019 in which over half were prospective, the most investigated populations were pregnant women and children. Racial/ethnic minorities, individuals of low socioeconomic status (SES), and those occupationally exposed were studied the least. The most studied persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were per-/poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and the most studied non-POPs were phenols. Across chemical classes, studies found certain POPs (e.g., PFAS) and non-POPs (i.e., phenols, phthalates, and parabens) to be associated with gestational diabetes and dysregulated glucose metabolism. Results for other cardiometabolic health outcomes were inconsistent but suggested certain chemicals may negatively affect cardiometabolic health. Summary: Synthetic chemicals likely adversely affect cardiometabolic health, but current findings were inconclusive. Few recent studies focused on racial/ethnic minorities, low SES, and occupationally exposed populations. To address poor cardiometabolic health and related disparities, more studies across vulnerable populations are warranted. © 2020, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s40572-020-00265-6,,,

An FPP located in the Netherlands has historically used perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) for fluoropolymer production and is currently using GenX (HFPO-DA; 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)propionic acid) as a replacement. This study reviewed existing data from open access reports and peer reviewed publications on the environmental presence of PFOA and GenX in environmental matrices such as surface water, groundwater, soil and vegetation. Published data on human exposure to PFOA and GenX (i.e. via drinking water and food as well as blood monitoring) were reviewed in order to assess the influence of the FPP on contamination of the local population. Concentrations in environmental and human exposure samples were compared to (inter)national quality standards or risk limits. The data showed higher PFOA and GenX concentrations in surface water, groundwater, soil and vegetation samples taken close to point sources, and the highest observed concentrations exceeded these standards and limits (except for PFOA in soil). Drinking water and food also contained higher PFOA and GenX concentrations in samples taken close to point sources compared to samples further away. Tolerable daily intake (TDIs) for both PFASs were exceeded, however, only in a maximum exposure scenario. Blood monitoring of the local population near the FPP, and FPP workers, confirmed high exposure can occur as blood concentrations of several individuals exceeded the safe level.

This review gives an overview of the literature on the effects of contaminants on the European eel and on the consequences on the biology and fitness of the eel in order to document the role of pollution in its decline. A variety of contaminants have been found to affect the eel. These contaminants may cause disturbance of the immune system, the reproduction system, the nervous system and the endocrine system and effects were reported on several levels of biological organization, from subcellular, organ, individual up to even population level.

Given this threat to living organisms, we carried out a broad review of possible sources of PFASs and their potential accumulation in agricultural plants, from where they can transfer to humans through the food chain. Analysis of the literature indicates a direct correlation between PFAS concentrations in soil and bioaccumulation in plants. Furthermore, plant uptake largely changes with chain length, functional group, plant species and organ. Low accumulations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) have been found in peeled potatoes and cereal seeds, while short-chain compounds can accumulate at high levels in leafy vegetables and fruits. Significant variations in PFAS buildup in plants according to soil amendment are also found, suggesting a particular interaction with soil organic matter.

Seafood consumption is thought to be an underappreciated source of PFAS exposure in the general population. This review synthesizes the current understanding of PFAS occurrence in shellfish, a term used to describe animals such as mollusk bivalves, certain gastropods (snails), cephalopods (e.g., octopuses and squid), and crustaceans, and highlights scientific gaps relative to bioaccumulation and the protection of shellfish consumers. Recent findings: A range of sampling methodologies are used across studies, and the suite of PFAS surveyed across studies is highly variable. Concentrations of PFAS observed in shellfish vary by geographic location, shellfish species, habitat, and across PFAS compounds, and studies informing estimates of bioaccumulation of PFAS in shellfish are extremely limited at this time. Summary: This review identifies several important opportunities for researchers to standardize PFAS sampling techniques, sample preparation, and analytical methodologies to allow for better comparison of PFAS analytes both within and across future studies. Increasing the range of geographic locations where samples are collected is also a critical priority to support a greater knowledge of worldwide PFAS contamination. When put into the context of risk to consumer, concentrations of PFAS, especially PFOS, found in shellfish collected from sites containing aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) and industrial contamination may present risks to frequent consumers.

They occupy the highest trophic positions in their food chains and are documented to bioaccumulate high concentrations of persistent pollutants such as toxic metals and legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs).Whereas raptors played a critical role in developing awareness of and policy for chemical pollution, they have thus far played a much smaller role in current research on contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Given the critical knowledge obtained from monitoring 'legacy contaminants' in raptors, more information on the levels and effects of CECs on raptors is urgently needed. This study critically reviews studies on raptors fromEurope reporting the occurrence of CECs with focus on the investigated species, the sampled matrices, and the bioanalytical methods applied. Based on this, we aimed to identify future needs for monitoring CECs in Europe. Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), novel flame retardants (NFRs), and to a lesser extent UV-filters, neonicotinoids, chlorinated paraffins, parabens and bisphenols have been reported in European raptors.

In the meantime, these persistent chemicals accumulated in the global environment. Some early studies e.g., on population exposures and toxicity, were not released to the public until after year 2000. Still, the first PFAS risk assessments ignored these reports and relied on scant journal publications. The first guidelines and legal limits for PFAS exposure, e.g., from drinking water, were proposed 10 years ago. They have decreased substantially since then, but remain higher than suggested by data on human adverse effects, especially on the immune system, that occur at background exposure levels. By now, the best-known PFASs are being phased out, and related PFASs are being introduced as substitutes.

Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on PFAS exposure and birth outcomes. Methods: Three electronic databases were searched for epidemiological studies through February 13, 2021. We used random-effects meta-analysis for eight birth outcome indicators to calculate summary effect estimates for various exposure types. The risk of bias and the overall quality and level of evidence for each exposure-outcome pair were assessed. Results: The initial search identified 58 potentially eligible studies, of which 46 were ultimately included. Many PFAS were found to have previously unrecognized statistically significant associations with birth outcomes. Specifically, birth weight (BW) was associated with PFAS, with effect sizes ranging from −181.209 g (95% confidence interval (CI) = −360.620 to −1.798) per 1 ng/ml increase in perfluoroheptanesulfonate (PFHpS) to −24.252 g (95% CI = −38.574 to −9.930) per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase in perfluorodecaoic acid (PFDA). Similar patterns were observed between other PFAS and birth outcomes: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) with birth length (BL) and ponderal index (PI), PFOS and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA) with head circumference (HC), PFHpS with gestational age (GA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and PFHpS with preterm birth (PTB). Additionally, PFDA showed a statistically significant association with small for gestational age (SGA). The level of the combined evidence for each exposure-outcome pair was considered to be “moderate”. Conclusion: This study showed that PFAS exposure was significantly associated with increased risks of various adverse birth outcomes and that different birth outcome indicators had different degrees of sensitivity to PFAS. Further studies are needed to confirm our results by expanding the sample size, clarifying the effects of different types or doses of PFAS and the time of blood collection on birth outcomes, and fully considering the possible confounders.

Recent Findings: Eleven human studies published before April 1st, 2021 were identified through database searches (PubMed, Dimensions, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus), and citation chaining (Citationchaser). The sample sizes of these studies ranged from 40 to 965, involving children and adolescents (n = 3), non-pregnant adults (n = 5), or pregnant women (n = 3). High-resolution liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was the primary analytical platform to measure both PFAS and metabolome. PFAS were measured in either plasma (n = 6) or serum (n = 5), while metabolomic profiles were assessed using plasma (n = 6), serum (n = 4), or urine (n = 1). Four types of PFAS (perfluorooctane sulfonate (n = 11), perfluorooctanoic acid (n = 10), perfluorohexane sulfonate (n = 9), perfluorononanoic acid (n = 5)) and PFAS mixtures (n = 7) were the most studied. We found that alterations to tryptophan metabolism and the urea cycle were most reported PFAS-associated metabolomic signatures. Numerous lipid metabolites were also suggested to be associated with PFAS exposure, especially key metabolites in glycerophospholipid metabolism which is critical for biological membrane functions, and fatty acids and carnitines which are relevant to the energy supply pathway of fatty acid oxidation. Other important metabolome changes reported included the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle regarding energy generation, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism in cellular energy systems. Conclusions: There is growing interest in using non-targeted metabolomics to study the human physiological changes associated with PFAS exposure. Multiple PFAS were reported to be associated with alterations in amino acid and lipid metabolism, but these results are driven by one predominant type of pathway analysis thus require further confirmation. Standardizing research methods and reporting are recommended to facilitate result comparison. Future studies should consider potential differences in study methodology, use of prospective design, and influence from confounding bias and measurement errors. © 2022","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.envint.2022.107159,Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

However, few studies have evaluated the effect of this exposure on cardiometabolic risk factors in preschool-age children. The health and disease development paradigm (DOHaD) proposes that the physiological and metabolic adaptations triggered by the exposure to these compounds, coupled with postnatal conditions, can modify the risk of disease. In this context, cardiometabolic risk factors in children are not only an important outcome derived from prenatal exposure but a predictor/mediator of the children’s future health. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the evidence published in the last 10 years from cohort studies on the association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and cardiometabolic risk factors in preschoolers. Design: Studies published from January 1, 2007 to May 1, 2017 in PubMed were analyzed. The research strategy was based on specified keywords and following the application of strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, 16 studies were identified and reviewed. Data were extracted and aspects of quality were assessed using an adapted Newcastle–Ottawa scale for cohort studies. Results: Only 5 of the 16 studies reviewed analyzed cardiometabolic risk factors in addition to anthropometric measures in children. The cohort studies included in this review suggest that prenatal exposure to low concentrations of EDCs has an impact on anthropometric variables and biochemical parameters in preschool-age children. Positive associations between prenatal exposure to EDCs and percentage of fat mass, body mass index, waist circumference, skinfolds and risk of overweight persisted after adjustment for important confounding variables. No association was found with lipid profile and glucose levels. Conclusions: Evidence was found to suggest that prenatal exposure to EDCs is positively associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in preschool children. © 2018 The Author(s).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: full text checked",10.29024/aogh.911,Cohort Studies,,

Studies have shown that perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are routinely detected in landfill leachate, with short chain (C4-C7) PFAAs being most abundant, possibly indicating their greater mobility, and reflecting the industrial shift towards shorter-chain compounds. Despite its restricted use, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) remains one of the most abundant PFAAs in landfill leachates. Recent studies have also documented the presence of PFAA-precursors (e.g., saturated and unsaturated fluorotelomer carboxylic acids) in landfill leachates at concentrations comparable to, or higher than, the most frequently detected PFAAs. Landfill ambient air also contains elevated concentrations of PFASs, primarily semi-volatile precursors (e.g., fluorotelomer alcohols) compared to upwind control sites, suggesting that landfills are potential sources of atmospheric PFASs. The fate of PFASs inside landfills is controlled by a combination of biological and abiotic processes, with biodegradation releasing most of the PFASs from landfilled waste to leachate. Biodegradation in simulated anaerobic reactors has been found to be closely related to the methanogenic phase. The methane-yielding stage also results in higher pH (>7) of leachates, correlated with higher mobility of PFAAs. Little information exists regarding PFAA-precursors in landfills. To avoid significant underestimation of the total PFAS released from landfills, PFAA-precursors and their degradation products should be determined in future studies. Owing to the semi-volatile nature of some precursor compounds and their degradation products, future studies also need to include landfill gas to clarify degradation pathways and the overall fate of PFASs. Landfill leachate and potentially landfill gas act as secondary environmental sources of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.envpol.2017.12.030,,,

This is compounded by variable regulatory oversight with respect to storage, use and waste management of these chemicals and their byproducts. This review synthesizes the data on the distribution of selected persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in waters in China. Surface water heavily polluted with POPs is distributed in the Yangtze River Estuary, Pearl River Delta, Minjiang River Estuary, Jiulongjiang Estuary, Daya Bay, Taihu Lake, and the waterways of Zhejiang Province, where concentrations of Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) frequently exceed both international and Chinese guideline values. These areas are mainly distributed along the southeast coast of China, within or downstream of major manufacturing districts, intensive agricultural basins, and other industrial centers. A comparison of the levels of OCPs in the aquatic environment of China with other indicative regions worldwide shows comparable levels of pollution (overall range from below detection limit (BDL) to 5104.8 ng/L and regional means from 2.9–929.6 ng/L). PAHs and PCBs pollution appear to be particularly serious in China (PAHs overall ranging from BDL to 474,000 ng/L with regional means from 15.1–72,400 ng/L; PCBs from BDL to 3161 ng/L with regional means ranging from 0.2–985.2 ng/L). There is as yet limited evidence of serious perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) pollution. We discuss major sources and processes responsible for high POP occurrence using a range of measures (including diagnostic ratios of different compounds), regulatory oversight and policy gaps in the control of POPs in China, and potential long-term health and ecological effects. We argue that water quality guidelines, pollution control measures and cleanup strategies for POPs in China should be urgently improved. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.12.007,China,,

In this review, toxicokinetic data of PFCAs (chain lengths ranging from 4 to 10) in different species are compared with an emphasis on their relevance to renal elimination. PFCAs vary in their affinities to bind to serum albumins in plasma, which is an important factor in determining the renal clearance of PFCAs. PFCA-albumin binding has been well characterized and is summarized in this review. The mechanism of the sex-, species-, and chain length-dependent renal PFCA elimination is a research area that has gained continuous interest since the beginning of toxicological studies of PFCAs. It is now recognized that organic anion transport proteins play a key role in PFCA renal tubular reabsorption, a process that is sex-, species-, and chain length-dependent. Recent studies on the identification of PFCA renal transport proteins and characterization of their transport kinetics have greatly improved our understanding of the PFCA renal transport mechanism at the molecular level. A mathematical representation of this renal tubular reabsorption mechanism has been incorporated in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Improvement of PBPK models in the future will require more accurate and quantitative characterization of renal transport pathways of PFCAs. To that end, a basolateral membrane efflux pathway for the reabsorption of PFCAs in the kidney is discussed in this review, which could provide a future research direction toward a better understanding of the mechanisms of PFCA renal elimination. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1021/tx200363w,,,

The aim of this review is to summarize several monitoring studies in Japan and characterize the toxicokinetics of these compounds. We found that the levels of contamination by these compounds had unique patterns in Japan. The levels of PFOA in serum from inhabitants of the Kansai region were higher than those of other regions. The PFOA levels in air and water samples from the Kansai region were also relatively high. The estimated intakes from these routes partly explain the differences in the serum levels. The toxicokinetics of these compounds have been investigated. Serum samples from male participants had significantly higher geometric means for PFOS and PFOA compared to samples from female participants. This sex-related difference was partly simulated by menstrual blood loss. There are large interspecies differences in the excretion pathways of these compounds. The serum clearances of PFOA via urine were 300-1,000-fold lower in humans than in Wistar rats and Japanese macaques. On the other hand, the biliary excretion of these compounds was comparable in rats and humans, and the long half-lives in humans may be attributable to the low levels of urinary excretion and high biliary reabsorption rates. These findings suggest that qualitative differences in the excretion routes exist between humans and other species.

There is ample evidence of substantial contamination of indoor dust with these chemicals and that their concentrations in indoor air exceed substantially those outdoors. Studies examining the relationship between body burden and exposure via indoor dust are inconsistent; while some indicate a link between body burdens and PBDE and HBCD exposure via dust ingestion, others find no correlation. Likewise, while concentrations in indoor dust and human tissues are both highly skewed, this does not necessarily imply causality. Evidence suggests exposure via dust ingestion is higher for toddlers than adults. Research priorities include identifying means of reducing indoor concentrations and indoor monitoring methods that provide the most ""biologically-relevant"" measures of exposure as well as monitoring a wider range of microenvironment categories.

Due to greater restrictions on PFOS globally in recent years, the production and use of F-53B correspondingly increased, consequently causing more emissions into the environment. In China, an increasing number of studies report frequent detection and broad exposure to F-53B in the natural environment, various wildlife and the human body. In human blood, the detection rate of F-53B is almost 80%, accounting for 8.69 to 28% of ∑per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). F-53B is the most biopersistent PFAS in humans to date, with a half-life of 15.3 years. In addition, F-53B displays protein binding affinity and high human placental permeability. Recently, some epidemiological studies have reported the health risks associated with F-53B in humans, including abnormal serum lipid metabolism, vascular dysfunction, endocrine disorders and even adverse birth outcomes. Various in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated the toxicity of F-53B, such as hepatotoxicity, interference effects on the endocrine system, as well as reproductive and developmental toxicity.

Although the obesity epidemic is largely fueled by poor nutrition and lack of exercise, certain chemicals have been shown to potentially have a role in its aetiology. A substantial body of evidence suggests that a subclass of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which interfere with endocrine signalling, can disrupt hormonally regulated metabolic processes, especially if exposure occurs during early development.

Fluoropolymers, high molecular weight polymers, have unique properties that constitute a distinct class within the PFAS group. Fluoropolymers have thermal, chemical, photochemical, hydrolytic, oxidative, and biological stability. They have negligible residual monomer and oligomer content and low to no leachables. Fluoropolymers are practically insoluble in water and not subject to long-range transport. With a molecular weight well over 100 000 Da, fluoropolymers cannot cross the cell membrane. Fluoropolymers are not bioavailable or bioaccumulative, as evidenced by toxicology studies on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE): acute and subchronic systemic toxicity, irritation, sensitization, local toxicity on implantation, cytotoxicity, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity, hemolysis, complement activation, and thrombogenicity. Clinical studies of patients receiving permanently implanted PTFE cardiovascular medical devices demonstrate no chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity and no reproductive, developmental, or endocrine toxicity. This paper brings together fluoropolymer toxicity data, human clinical data, and physical, chemical, thermal, and biological data for review and assessment to show that fluoropolymers satisfy widely accepted assessment criteria to be considered as “polymers of low concern” (PLC). This review concludes that fluoropolymers are distinctly different from other polymeric and nonpolymeric PFAS and should be separated from them for hazard assessment or regulatory purposes. Grouping fluoropolymers with all classes of PFAS for “read across” or structure–activity relationship assessment is not scientifically appropriate.

This systematic review aims to assess PFAS associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) concentrations in human populations. Method: We systematically searched four online databases, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library for relevant peer-reviewed English language articles published until July 2021. Additional relevant articles identified were also included in the search results. We categorised populations into adults (≥18 years old) and children. Primary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and LDL, HDL, TC, and TG concentrations in the serum, plasma, or whole blood; secondary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and the odds of lipid-related health outcomes. Quantitative synthesis was done by vote counting of the effect directions between concentrations of PFAS and lipids/health outcomes, repeated on articles with sample size >1000. Sign tests were performed to assess the statistical significance of the differences between positive and negative associations. Sensitivity analysis was performed by separating out articles with populations having high concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Quality was assessed with the STROBE checklist and NHBLI Study Quality Assessment Tool. Results: A total of 58 articles were included for review. There was evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with higher concentrations of LDL, HDL, and TC, particularly for PFOA-LDL, PFOA-TC, PFOS-TC, and PFNA-LDL. Associations between PFAS and TG tended to be negative, especially for perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). Associations between PFAS concentration and the odds of secondary outcomes generally supported a positive association between PFAS and cholesterol concentrations. Conclusion: We found evidence of associations between the concentrations of some PFAS-lipid pairs in human populations. Future research should be conducted on the less well-studied PFAS to explore their effects on human health and in regions where such studies are currently lacking.

A wider range of geographical locations (e.g., South America, Russia, Antarctica) and habitats (e.g., high-mountain lakes, deep-ocean, and offshore waters) have been investigated in recent years enabling a better understanding of the global distribution of PFCs in aquatic organisms. High concentrations of PFCs continue to be detected in invertebrates, fish, reptiles, and marine mammals worldwide. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is still the predominant PFC detected (mean concentrations up to 1900 ng/g ww) in addition to important concentrations of long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs; sum PFCAs up to 400 ng/g ww). More studies have evaluated the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of these compounds in both freshwater and marine food webs. Several reports have indicated a decrease in PFOS levels over time in contrast to PFCA concentrations that have tended to increase in tissues of aquatic organisms at many locations.

Temporal trend studies using human, fish, bird, and marine mammal samples indicate that exposure to PFSs has increased significantly over the past 15-25 years. This review summarizes the biological monitoring of PFCAs, PFSAs, and related PFSs in wildlife and humans, compares concentrations and contamination profiles among species and locations, evaluates the bioaccumulation/biomagnification in the environment, discusses possible sources, and identifies knowledge gaps. PFSs can reach elevated concentrations in humans and wildlife inhabiting industrialized areas of North America, Europe, and Asia (2-30 000 ng/mL or ng/g of wet weight (ww)). PFSs have also been detected in organisms from the Arctic and mid-ocean islands (≤3000 ng/g ww). In humans, PFSAs and PFCAs have been shown to vary among ethnic groups and PFCA/PFSA profiles differ from those in wildlife with high proportions of perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate. The pattern of contamination in wildlife varied among species and locations suggesting multiple emission sources. Food web analyses have shown that PFCAs and PFSAs can bioaccumulate and biomagnify in marine and freshwater ecosystems. Knowledge gaps with respect to the transport, accumulation, biodegradation, temporal/spatial trends and PFS precursors have been identified.

The purpose of this study was to understand the levels and profiles of POPs in breast milk in China and assess their potential health risks among breastfed infants under six months of age. A literature review focused on China was performed for studies published from 2001 to 2020. The POP levels in breast milk along with other important variables were extracted, and then the average individual POP levels in breast milk were estimated. This review summarises the distribution of traditional and new POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), legacy brominated flame retardants (BFRs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and chlorinated paraffins (CPs) and reported notably high levels of short-chain chlorinated paraffins and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p’-DDE) in breast milk. Although the levels of traditional POPs generally declined over time, especially p,p’-DDE and beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH), women living in coastal areas, urban areas, and southern China still have a high body burden of certain POPs. In the present study, the estimated daily intake (EDI) of POPs through breastfeeding was used to evaluate the health risk for infants by comparing with acceptable levels. The findings suggested that infants born in coastal areas most likely suffered potential health risk from exposure to DDT, and the health risk of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in infants in most nationwide regions remains a concern. More importantly, the EDI of PCBs for infants exceeds the safe limit on a national scale.

Neither chemical nor biological mechanisms can decompose PFAS due to their strong C-F bonds. PFAS have shown adverse effects on various organisms, even at trace levels. Accordingly, highly sensitive and selective analytical methods are required for their tracing in biological and environmental matrices. The physicochemical properties of PFAS like surfactant characteristics and high-water solubility are unique and different from other known pollutants. Accordingly, the number of articles on the analysis of PFAS is less than the other well-known contaminants. The routine PFAS sample preparation methods (like solvent extraction) coupled with chromatographic systems, face challenges such as high limits of detection, need for laborious derivatization, limited selectivity, and expensive instrumentation. Recent efforts to address these limitations have aroused considerable attention to the development of microextraction techniques, which are consistent with the principles of green chemistry and can be made easily portable and automated. Moreover, these methods have shown enough sensitivity and selectivity for the analysis of different analytes (including PFAS) in a wide range of samples with different matrices.

Obesity occurs when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure; however, individuals vary widely in their propensity to gain weight and accrue fat mass, even at identical levels of excess caloric input. Clinical, epidemiological, and biological studies show that obesity is largely programmed during early life, including the intrauterine period. The environmental obesogen hypothesis holds that prenatal or early life exposure to certain endocrine disrupting chemicals can predispose exposed individuals to increased fat mass and obesity. Obesogen exposure can alter the epigenome of multipotent stromal stem cells, biasing them toward the adipocyte lineage at the expense of bone. Hence, humans exposed to obesogens during early life might have an altered stem cell compartment, which is preprogrammed toward an adipogenic fate. This results in a higher steady state number of adipocytes and potentially a lifelong struggle to maintain a healthy weight, which can be exacerbated by societal influences that promote poor diet and inadequate exercise. This review focuses on the developmental origins of the adipocyte, the relationship between adipocyte number and obesity, and how obesogenic chemicals may interfere with the highly efficient homeostatic mechanisms regulating adipocyte number and energy balance. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: full text checked",10.1002/bdrc.20197,Obesity,,

It has been used in a wide range of industrial and consumer products for decades. The unique properties of PFOS, including its stability and resistance to degradation, have made it highly persistent in the aquatic environment. Because of its persistence, potential toxicity, and occurrence in aquatic ecosystems, interest in PFOS has increased in recent decades. Despite this interest, current information on the environmental distribution of PFOS in ambient surface waters of the United States is fairly limited. This critical review summarizes the currently available literature on PFOS occurrence in surface waters across the United States and highlights existing data gaps. Available data are largely from a handful of study areas with known PFAS manufacturing or industrial uses, with much of the data collected from freshwater systems in eastern states and the upper Midwest. Measured PFOS concentrations in surface waters vary widely, over 8 orders of magnitude, with the highest concentrations occurring downstream from manufacturing and industrial use plants, areas near aqueous film-forming foam–use sites, and sites where PFOS precursors were used in textile treatment. Non–point source–related occurrences are highest near urbanized areas with high population densities. Current data illustrate the occurrence of PFOS in surface waters across multiple US states. Additional data are needed to better understand PFOS occurrence in US aquatic ecosystems, particularly in estuarine and marine systems and where monitoring data are not available (e.g., southwestern, central, and western United States). Additional PFOS occurrence data would provide valuable information on potential spatial and temporal variability in surface waters and possible risks posed to aquatic ecosystems.

That is, especially in countries where an abundance of chemicals called endocrine disruptors has repeatedly been reported, both in the environment and in human matrices. Human exposure to persistent and non-persistent chemicals is ubiquitous and associated with endocrine-disrupting effects. This group of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) can act as agonists or antagonists of hormone receptors and can thus significantly affect a number of physiological processes. It can even negatively affect human reproduction with an impact on the development of gonads and gametogenesis, fertilization, and the subsequent development of embryos. The negative effects of endocrine disruptors on sperm gametogenesis and male fertility in general have been investigated and repeatedly demonstrated in experimental and epidemiological studies. Male reproduction is affected by endocrine disruptors via their effect on testicular development, impact on estrogen and androgen receptors, potential epigenetic effect, production of reactive oxygen species or direct effect on spermatozoa and other cells of testicular tissue. Emerging scientific evidence suggests that the increasing incidence of male infertility is associated with the exposure to persistent and non-persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as bisphenols and perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFAS).

The Navigation Guide was developed to effectively and efficiently translate the available scientific evidence into timely prevention-oriented action.Objectives: We applied the Navigation Guide systematic review method to answer the question “Does fetal developmental exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or its salts affect fetal growth in animals ?” and to rate the strength of the experimental animal evidence.Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature, applied prespecified criteria to the search results to identify relevant studies, extracted data from studies, obtained additional informationfrom study authors, conducted meta-analyses, and rated the overall quality and strength of the evidence.Conclusion: Based on this first application of the Navigation Guide methodology, we found sufficient evidence that fetal developmental exposure to PFOA reduces fetal growth in animals. © 2014, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

We describe recent developments in assessing pollutant exposures and health threats posed by industrial facilities using or releasing synthetic chemicals to nearby communities in the U.S. Recent Findings: More people are living near oil and gas development due to the expansion of unconventional extraction techniques as well as near industrial animal operations, both with suggestive evidence of increased exposure to hazardous pollutants and adverse health effects. Legacy contamination continues to adversely impact a new generation of residents in fenceline communities, with recent studies documenting exposures to toxic metals and poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Researchers are also giving consideration to acute exposures resulting from inadvertent industrial chemical releases, including those resulting from extreme weather events linked to climate change. Natural experiments of industrial closures or cleanups provide compelling evidence that exposures from industry harm the health of nearby residents. Summary: New and legacy industries, coupled with climate change, present unique health risks to communities living near industry due to the release of toxic chemicals.

However, data clearly characterizing the impact of environmental exposures and health endpoints in African populations is limited. To describe recent progress and identify important research gaps, we reviewed literature on environmental health research in African populations over the last decade, as well as research incorporating both genomic and environmental factors. We queried PubMed for peer-reviewed research articles, reviews, or books examining environmental exposures and health outcomes in human populations in Africa. Searches utilized medical subheading (MeSH) terms for environmental exposure categories listed in the March 2018 US National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals, which includes chemicals with worldwide distributions. Our search strategy retrieved 540 relevant publications, with studies evaluating health impacts of ambient air pollution (n=105), indoor air pollution (n = 166), heavy metals (n = 130), pesticides (n = 95), dietary mold (n = 61), indoor mold (n = 9), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs, n = 0), electronic waste (n = 9), environmental phenols (n = 4), flame retardants (n = 8), and phthalates (n = 3), where publications could belong to more than one exposure category. Only 23 publications characterized both environmental and genomic risk factors. Cardiovascular and respiratory health endpoints impacted by air pollution were comparable to observations in other countries. Air pollution exposures unique to Africa and some other resource limited settings were dust and specific occupational exposures. Literature describing harmful health effects of metals, pesticides, and dietary mold represented a context unique to Africa. Studies of exposures to phthalates, PFASs, phenols, and flame retardants were very limited. These results underscore the need for further focus on current and emerging environmental and chemical health risks as well as better integration of genomic and environmental factors in African research studies. Environmental exposures with distinct routes of exposure, unique co-exposures and co-morbidities, combined with the extensive genomic diversity in Africa may lead to the identification of novel mechanisms underlying complex disease and promising potential for translation to global public health. © Copyright © 2020 Joubert, Mantooth and McAllister.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.3389/fgene.2019.01166,Environmental Health,,

These effects include increased β-oxidation of fatty acids, increases in several cytochrome P-450 (CYP450)-mediated reactions, and inhibition of the secretion of very low-density lipoproteins and cholesterol from the liver. These effects on lipid metabolism and transport result in a reduction of cholesterol and triglycerides in serum and an accumulation of lipids in the liver. The triad of tumors observed (liver, Leydig cell, and pancreatic acinar-cell) is typical of many PPAR agonists and is believed to involve nongenotoxic mechanisms. The hepatocellular tumors observed in rats are likely to have been the result of the activation of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα). The tumors observed in the testis (Leydig-cell) have been hypothesized to be associated with an increased level of serum estradiol in concert with testicular growth factors. The mechanism responsible for the acinarcell tumors of the pancreas in rats remains the subject of active investigation. The mechanism resulting in the hepatocellular tumors in rats (PPARα activation) is not likely to be relevant to humans. Similarly, the proposed mechanism for Leydig-cell tumor formation is of questionable relevance to humans. Acinar tumors of the pancreas are rare in humans, and the relevance of the these tumors, as found in rats, to humans is uncertain.

PFCs have been detected in drinking water samples, aquatic life, human tissue, and blood serum. This is attributed to their xenobiotic attributes making them environmentally persistent, bio-accumulative, and globally distributed in water receiving bodies, posing serious health problems to aquatic life and human health. This is ascribed to PFCs’ peculiar physicochemical properties of being hydrophobic and oleophobic and their removal process from wastewater streams is different from any other organic pollutants. Therefore, this review summarizes the environmental occurrence and recent developments on microbial degradation of the most detected PFCs, i.e., perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) in water bodies. The available literature suggests that PFOA and PFOS are susceptible to biodegradation by Acidimicrobium sp. strain A6, Pseudomonas parafulva strain YAB1, Pseudomonas plecoglossicidia 2.4-D, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain HJ4. Moreover, the current study presents a summary on phytoremediation of PFOA and PFOS as a sustainable green technology. Despite the extensive work undertaken on bioremediation of PFOA and PFOS by biological processes, the available literature suggests that a lot of work still needs to be carried out aimed at investigating the biodegradation pathway of PFOA and PFOS by both microbial species and plants. © 2022 by the authors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.3390/app122312196,Body Water,,

In this sense, the present note addresses the role of PFCs as vectors, making this review one of its kind. This graphical review discusses the ability of PFCs to interact with different matrices, such as heavy metals, organic matter, and bacterial cell membranes via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, and aggregation and micelle formation, allowing them to act as vectors for various chemical and biological contaminants. This PFC-mediated transport can alter the tendency of both -PFCs and the contaminant to persist, bioaccumulate, and co-transport between and within disparate environmental matrices, as well as their interfaces.

Objectives: To create a systematic evidence map of environmental epidemiological studies examining environmental contaminant exposures with ‘omics in order to characterize the extent of available studies for future research needs. Methods: Systematic review methods were used to search and screen the literature and included the use of machine learning methods to facilitate screening studies. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were developed to identify and screen relevant studies. Studies that met the PECO criteria after full-text review were summarized with information such as study population, study design, sample size, exposure measurement, and ‘omics analysis. Results: Over 10,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes were used to identify 84 studies considered PECO-relevant after full-text review.

They are highly persistent, bioaccumulative, and cause adverse effects in humans and wildlife. Because of the widespread use of these organohalogens in household items and consumer products, indoor contamination may be a significant source of human exposure, especially for children. One significant concern with regard to health effects associated with exposure to organohalogens is endocrine disruption. This review focuses on PCBs and PBDEs as old and new organohalogens, respectively, and their effects on two neuroendocrine systems; thyroid hormones and the arginine vasopressin system (AVP). Regarding neuroendocrine effects of organohalogens, there is considerable information on the thyroid system as a target and evidence is now accumulating that the AVP system and associated functions are also susceptible to disruption. AVP-mediated functions such as osmoregulation, cardiovascular function as well as social behavior, sexual function and learning/memory are discussed. For both thyroid and AVP systems, the timing of exposure seems to play a major role in the outcome of adverse effects. The mechanism of organohalogen action is well understood for the thyroid system. In comparison, this aspect is understudied in the AVP system but some similarities in neural processes, shown to be targeted by these pollutants, serve as promising possibilities for study. One challenge in understanding modes of action within neuroendocrine systems is their complexity stemming, in part, from interdependent levels of organization. Further, because of the interplay between neuroendocrine and neural functions and behavior, further investigation into organohalogen-mediated effects is warranted and may yield insights with wider scope. Indeed, the current literature provides scattered evidence regarding the role of organohalogen-induced neuroendocrine disruption in the neuroplasticity related to both learning functions and brain structure but future studies are needed to establish the role of endocrine disruption in nervous system function and development. © 2010.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: full text checked",10.1016/j.yfrne.2010.06.005,Arginine;Arginine Vasopressin;Neuronal Plasticity;Thyroid Gland,,

The plight of African vultures exemplifies these challenges due to environmental contaminants and other stressors acting on individuals and populations that are already threatened or endangered. Many of these threats emanate from increasing human population size and settlement density, habitat loss from changing land use for agriculture, residential areas, and industry, and climate-related changes in resource availability. Environmental chemicals that are hazardous include legacy chemicals, emerging chemicals of concern, and high-volume-use chemicals that are employed as weed killers and in other agricultural applications. Furthermore, there are differences in risk for species living in close proximity to humans or in areas affected by habitat loss, climate, and industry. Monitoring programs are essential to track the status of nesting pairs, offspring survival, longevity, and lifetime productivity. This is important for long-lived birds, such as vultures, that may be especially vulnerable to chronic exposure to chemicals as obligate scavengers. Furthermore, their position in the food web may increase risk due to biomagnification of chemicals. We review the primary chemical hazards to Old World vultures and the interacting stressors affecting these and other birds. Habitat is a major consideration for vultures, with tree-nesters and cliff-nesters potentially experiencing different risks of exposure to environmental chemicals. The present review provides information from long-term monitoring programs and discusses a range of these threats and their effects on vulture populations.

PFOA and its salts are commercially used in various industrial processes. The chemical is persistent in the environment and does not undergo biotransformation. It was reported that PFOA is found not only in the serum of occupationally exposed workers but also general populations. Recent studies have suggested that the biological half-life of PFOA in humans is 4.37 years based on study of occupationally exposed workers. It is increasingly suspect that PFOA accumulates and affects human health, although the toxicokinetics of PFOA in humans remain unclear. In experimental animals, PFOA seems low in toxicity. PFOA is well-absorbed following oral and inhalation exposure, and to a lesser extent following dermal exposure. Once absorbed in the body, it distributes predominantly to the liver and plasma, and to a lesser extent the kidney and lungs. PFOA is excreted in both urine and feces. Biological half-life of PFOA is quite different between species and sexes and the difference is due mainly to the difference in renal clearance. In rats, renal clearance of PFOA is regulated by sex hormones, especially testosterone. PFOA is excreted into urine by active tubular secretion, and certain organic anion transporters are thought to be responsible for the secretion. Fecal excretion is also important in the elimination of PFOA. There is evidence that PFOA undergoes enterohepatic circulation resulting in reduced amounts of fecal excretion. Elucidation of the mechanisms of transport in biological systems leads to elimination and detoxification of this chemical in the human body.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.2131/jts.28.49,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Animal Shells;Animals,,

Due to their unique chemical properties, widespread production, environmental distribution, long-term persistence, bioaccumulative potential, and associated risks for human health, PFAS have been classified as persistent organic pollutants of significant concern. Scientific evidence from the last several decades suggests that their widespread occurrence in the environment correlates with adverse effects on human health and ecology. The presence of PFAS in the aquatic environment demonstrates a close link between the anthroposphere and the hydrological cycle, and concentrations of PFAS in surface and groundwater range in value along the ng L−1–μg L−1 scale. Here, we critically reviewed the research published in the last decade on the global occurrence and distribution of PFAS in the aquatic environment. Ours is the first paper to critically evaluate the occurrence of PFAS at the continental scale and the evolving global regulatory responses to manage and mitigate the adverse human health risks posed by PFAS. The review reports that PFAS are widespread despite being phased out—they have been detected in different continents irrespective of the level of industrial development. Their occurrence far from the potential sources suggests that long-range atmospheric transport is an important pathway of PFAS distribution. Recently, several studies have investigated the health impacts of PFAS exposure—they have been detected in biota, drinking water, food, air, and human serum. In response to the emerging information about PFAS toxicity, several countries have provided administrative guidelines for PFAS in water, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Germany, and Australia. In the US, additional regulatory measures are under consideration. Further, many PFAS have now been listed as persistent organic pollutants.

We rated both the human and nonhuman mammalian evidence as “moderate” quality and “sufficient” strength. Integration of these evidence ratings produced a final strength of evidence rating in which review authors concluded that PFOA is “known to be toxic” to human reproduction and development based on sufficient evidence of decreased fetal growth in both human and nonhuman mammalian species.Conclusion: We concluded that developmental exposure to PFOA adversely affects human health based on sufficient evidence of decreased fetal growth in both human and nonhuman mammalian species.

A systematic review,2018,1,1,,,,,,"Land M., De Wit C.A., Bignert A., Cousins I.T., Herzke D., Johansson J.H., Martin J.W.",,,,,"Background: There is a concern that continued emissions of man-made per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may cause environmental and human health effects. Now widespread in human populations and in the environment, several PFASs are also present in remote regions of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of PFASs are not well understood. Phasing out the manufacture of some types of PFASs started in 2000 and further regulatory and voluntary actions have followed. The objective of this review is to understand the effects of these actions on global scale PFAS concentrations. Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations were performed in bibliographic databases, on the internet, through stakeholder contacts and in review bibliographies. No time, document type, language or geographical constraints were applied in the searches. Relevant subjects included human and environmental samples. Two authors screened all retrieved articles. Dual screening of 10% of the articles was performed at title/abstract and full-text levels by all authors. Kappa tests were used to test consistency. Relevant articles were critically appraised by four reviewers, with double checking of 20% of the articles by a second reviewer. Meta-analysis of included temporal trends was considered but judged to not be appropriate. The trends were therefore discussed in a narrative synthesis. Results: Available evidence suggests that human concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) generally are declining, while previously increasing concentrations of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) have begun to level off. Rapid declines for PFOS-precursors (e.g. perfluorooctane sulfonamide, FOSA) have also been consistently observed in human studies. In contrast, limited data indicate that human concentrations of PFOS and PFOA are increasing in China where the production of these substances has increased. Human concentrations of longer-chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) with 9-14 carbon atoms are generally increasing or show insignificant trends with too low power to detect a trend. For abiotic and biological environmental samples there are no clear patterns of declining trends. Most substances show mixed results, and a majority of the trends are insignificant with low power to detect a trend. Conclusions: For electrochemically derived PFASs, including PFOS and PFOA, most human studies in North America and Europe show consistent statistically significant declines. This contrasts with findings in wildlife and in abiotic environmental samples, suggesting that declining PFOS, PFOS-precursor and PFOA concentrations in humans likely resulted from removal of certain PFASs from commercial products including paper and board used in food packaging. Increasing concentrations of long-chain PFCAs in most matrices, and in most regions, is likely due to increased use of alternative PFASs. Continued temporal trend monitoring in the environment with well-designed studies with high statistical power are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of past and continuing regulatory mitigation measures. For humans, more temporal trend studies are needed in regions where manufacturing is most intense, as the one human study available in China is much different than in North America or Europe. © 2018 The Author(s).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s13750-017-0114-y,,,

Identifying the source responsible for a pollution hot spot is vital for assessing remediation measures, however, as there are many possible sources of environmental PFAS pollution, this can be challenging. Chemical fingerprinting has been proposed as an approach to identify contamination sources. Here, concentrations and profiles (relative distribution profiles) of routinely targeted PFAS in freshwater fish from eight sites in Norway, representing three different sources: (1) production of paper products, (2) the use of aqueous film forming foams (AFFF), and (3) long-range atmospheric transport, were investigated. The data were retrieved from published studies. Results showed that fingerprinting of PFAS in fish can be used to identify the dominant exposure source(s), and the profiles associated with the different sources were described in detail. Based on the results, the liver was concluded to be better suited for source tracking compared to muscle. PFAS fingerprints originating from AFFF were dominated by perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and other perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids (PFSA). Fingerprints originating from both long-range atmospheric transport and production of paper products were associated with high percentages of long chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA). However, there were differences between the two latter sources with respect to the ∑PFAS concentrations and ratios of specific PFCA pairs (PFUnDA/PFDA and PFTrDA/PFDoDA). Low ∑PFAS concentrations were detected in fish exposed mainly to PFAS via long-range atmospheric transport. In contrast, ∑PFAS concentrations were high and high percentages of PFOS were detected in fish exposed to pollution from production of paper products. The source-specific fingerprints described here can be used for source tracking.

They have been detected ubiquitously in ambient water along with other environmental matrices, and their adverse effects on aquatic organisms have been a subject of active investigation. Here, we intended to summarize and synthesize the existing body of knowledge on PFAA toxicity through an extensive literature review, and shed light on areas where further research is warranted. PFAA toxicity appears to be influenced by the sex and developmental stages of aquatic organisms, but not significantly by exposure route. PFAA-induced aquatic toxicity could be classified as metabolism disturbance, reproduction disruption, oxidative stress, developmental toxicity, thyroid disruption, etc. At the molecular level, these responses can be initiated by key events, such as nuclear receptor activation, reactive oxygen species induction, or interaction with a membrane, followed by a cascade of downstream responses. PFAA-induced toxicity involves diverse metabolic processes, and therefore elucidating crosstalk or interactions among diverse metabolic pathways is a challenging task. In the presence of other chemicals, PFAAs can function as agonists or antagonists, resulting in different directions of combined toxicity. Therefore, mixture toxicity with other groups of chemicals is another research opportunity. Experimental evidence supports the trans-generational toxicity of PFAAs, suggesting that their long-term consequences for aquatic ecosystems should become of concern. A recent global ban of several PFAAs resulted in an increasing dependence on PFAA alternatives.

EC research in Southeast Asia is especially critical due to its high population density and poor sanitation infrastructure that introduce large amounts of ECs into the aquatic environment. This literature Review investigated the status of EC research in 11 Southeast Asian countries. Key pharmaceutical groups such as antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, sulfamethazine, ciprofloxacin, and lincomycin) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (diclofenac, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen) were among the most frequently studied group of ECs, while other significant groups of interests in this Review included per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and phthalate esters (PAEs). With most Southeast Asian countries having agrarian economies and the onset of climate change, the overutilization of antibiotics and pesticides to meet the commercial demand for agriculture and livestock products is a major threat to aquatic environments and even human health in this region.

Ubiquitous exposures to PFAS, in consideration of their persistence, bioaccumulation potential, and toxicities have led to concerns regarding possible harmful effects during critical periods of development in early-life and long-term consequences on health. The potential effects of PFAS depend on various factors including the type of PFAS and the timing and level of exposure. We performed a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature to assess the effects of early-life PFAS exposure on prenatal and postnatal growth, adiposity, and puberty in children and adolescents. For birth size, most studies indicated that prenatal PFAS exposure, in particular long-chain PFAS, may impair fetal growth, albeit some reports of null associations with maternal PFAS. For growth within 2 years of age, prenatal PFAS exposure showed no associations with height and either null or negative associations with weight. However, postnatal PFAS exposures were inversely related to height and weight at 2 years in a cross-sectional study. For postnatal adiposity, prenatal PFAS may mostly have negative associations with body mass index in the first 2 years of life, but positive relationships with adiposity in childhood and adolescence, although some studies showed null associations. For puberty, the evidence for associations between early-life PFAS exposure and pubertal development or sex hormone levels were limited and inconclusive. From experimental studies, plausible mechanisms through which PFAS may affect early-life growth and puberty include PFAS-induced activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, alterations of thyroid or steroid hormone synthesis and metabolism, and their weak estrogenic or anti-androgenic properties. Although the published literature suggests possible effects of PFAS exposures on early-life growth, adiposity, and puberty, current human evidence is limited in establishing PFAS-induced effects on early-life physical development. Further investigation is warranted to clarify PFAS-induced effects on growth and physical development in consideration of the critical time-window of exposure, concomitant exposure to chemical mixtures including various PFAS types, and possible non-monotonic dose-response relationship for growth and adiposity trajectories. © Copyright © 2021 Lee, Jung, Kim, Choi and Lee.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.3389/fendo.2021.683297,"RNA, Messenger;Polyglactin 910;Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;Poly A-U;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Poly I-C;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins;Growth Substances",,

The incidence of thyroid cancer is thought to be rapidly and steadily increasing in recent decades. Recent studies have described thyroid cancer as the 4th most common cancer today, up from 14th in the early 1990s. This increase is mainly due to various environmental factors including: radiation, smoking, obesity, pollutants such as pesticides, phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluorinated compounds, bromine flame retardants, perchlorates, nitrates and various elements such as metals, non-metals and metalloids. In particular, some metals such as iron, copper, cadmium, lead, vanadium, chromium, manganese and nickel have a positive effect, while others such as zinc and magnesium have a negative correlation with thyroid cancer. Other metals such as molybdenum, tin and cobalt appear to increase the incidence of thyroid cancer in combination, while sodium, mercury, aluminum and silver have no evidence of thyroid carcinogenicity. Of the non-metals, iodine and selenium deficiency are associated with carcinogenic effects on the thyroid, while there is no information on any phosphorus-relative activity. Boron belonging to the metalloids is considered a goitrogenic element and probably increases the incidence of thyroid cancer when it acts in combination with cadmium, molybdenum, taken in small non-toxic doses, for a long time.

Although these compounds have probably been present in the environment for many decades, we are only now beginning to realize that these environmental contaminants may have serious environmental and health effects. This article gives a state-of-the-art review of synthetic approaches that have been employed for the synthesis of these environmentally relevant fluorinated compounds. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid derivatives, in particular, pose a problem because only a few perfluorooctanesulfonic acid derivatives are available from commercial sources-a fact that limits the ability of researchers worldwide to further study these compounds. Because of the limited literature available, this article also describes synthetic approaches for shorter chain homologues or perfluoroether analogues that can potentially be applied for the synthesis of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid derivatives. The preparation of typical starting materials for the synthesis of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid derivatives such as the perfluoroalkanesulfonyl fluorides and chlorides will be discussed. Subsequently, their conversion into relevant perfluoroalkane sulfonate salts (RFSO3M), sulfonamides (RFSO2NH 2), N-alkyl sulfonamides (RFSO2NHR, R = alkyl), N,N-dialkyl sulfonamides (RFSO2NR2, R = alkyl), sulfonamidoethanol (RFSO2NRCH2CH 2OH, R = -H, -CH3 or -C2H5) and sulfonamidoacetates (RFSO2NRCH2CO2H, R = -H, -CH3 or -C2H5) will be described.

Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) can be an important tool to derive recommendations for cultivation or handling of crops prior consumption. This review compiles >4500 soil-to-plant BAFs for 45 PFASs from 24 studies involving 27 genera of agricultural crops. Grasses (Poaceae) provided most BAFs with the highest number of values for perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid. Influencing factors on PFAS transfer like compound-specific properties (hydrophobicity, chain length, functional group, etc.), plant species, compartments, and other boundary conditions are critically discussed. Throughout the literature, BAFs were higher for vegetative plant compartments than for reproductive and storage organs. Decreasing BAFs per additional perfluorinated carbon were clearly apparent for aboveground parts (up to 1.16 in grains) but not always for roots (partly down to zero). Combining all BAFs per single perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid (C4-C14) and sulfonic acid (C4-C10), median log BAFs decreased by −0.25(±0.029) and −0.24(±0.013) per fluorinated carbon, respectively. For the first time, the plant uptake of ultra-short-chain (≤ C3) perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) was reviewed and showed a ubiquitous occurrence of trifluoroacetic acid in plants independent from the presence of other PFAAs. Based on identified knowledge gaps, it is suggested to focus on the uptake of precursors to PFAAs, PFAAs ≤C3, and additional emerging PFASs such as GenX or fluorinated ethers in future research. Studies regarding the uptake of PFASs by sugar cane, which accounts for about one fifth of the global crop production, are completely lacking and are also recommended.

This diversity in PFAS chemical characteristics combined with varying environmental factors also impact the bioaccumulation of these compounds in different organisms. In this review, we evaluate environmental factors (such as organic carbon, proteins, lipids, and dissolved cations) as well as PFAS characteristics (head group, chain-length, and concentration) that contribute to the significant variation seen in the literature of bioaccumulation metrics reported for organisms in aquatic ecosystems. Of the factors evaluated, it was found that PFAS concentration, dissolved organic matter, sediment organic matter, and biotransformation of precursor PFAS tended to significantly impact reported bioaccumulation metrics the most.

As our knowledge on their environmental and health impacts grow, PFAS have drawn increasing regulatory attention and research interest in recent years. While long-chain PFAS have been the center of active research in the past decade or so, and while industrial production and applications of short-china PFAS continue to rise, very few studies have focused on the occurrence, fate, and transformation of short-chain PFAS in the environment. This review aimed to provide an updated overview of the state of the science about the fundamentals, occurrence, impacts and treatment of short-chain PFAS. The key findings from this review include: 1) Short-chain PFAS are more widely detected, more persistent and mobile in aquatic systems, and thus may pose more risks on the human and ecosystem health; 2) conventional adsorption, ion-exchange, and membrane filtration can remove short-chain PFAS, but are less effective than the long-chain homologues, and are challenged with poor material regeneration efficiency and disposal of process waste residual; 3) advanced oxidation such as thermolysis and sonolysis can achieve complete mineralization, but come with a high process cost; and 4) direct photolysis, oxidation/reduction, photocatalysis, and electrochemical reaction may degrade short-chain PFAS following similar degradation pathways as long-chain PFAS, but at a slower rate, and photocatalytic processes appear most promising. Overall, this review reveals an urgent need for developing more cost-effective treatment technologies for short-chain PFAS in drinking water, for advancing our knowledge on the environmental fate, transport and impacts of short-chain PFAS in the environment, and for developing science-based regulations for short-chain PFAS. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.cej.2019.122506,,,

These processes are orchestrated by intracellular, endocrine, and paracrine signaling processes. Because of this complexity, testis development can be disrupted by a variety of environmental toxicants. The toxicity of phthalic acid esters (phthalates) on the fetal testis has been the subject of extensive research for two decades, and phthalates have become an archetypal fetal testis toxicant. Phthalates disrupt the seminiferous cord formation and maturation, Sertoli cell function, biosynthesis of testosterone in Leydig cells, and impair germ cell survival and development, producing characteristic multinucleated germ cells. However, the mechanisms responsible for these effects are not fully understood. This review describes current knowledge of the adverse effects of phthalates on the fetal testis and their associated windows of sensitivity, and compares and contrasts the mechanisms by which toxicants of current interest, bisphenol A and its replacements, analgesics, and perfluorinated alkyl substances, alter testicular developmental processes.

Here, we review the toxic effects of PFASs encountered by various plants from physiological, biochemical and molecular perspectives. The exposure routes and bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites are also summarized. The bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites varied between ng/g and μg/g levels. The 50% inhibition concentration of PFASs for plant growth is often several orders of magnitude higher than the environmentally relevant concentrations (ERCs). ERCs of PFASs rarely lead to obvious phenotypic/physiological damages in plants, but markedly perturb some biological activities at biochemical and molecular scales. PFAS exposure induces the over-generated reactive oxygen species and further damages plant cell structure and organelle functions. A number of biochemical activities in plant cells are perturbed, such as photosynthesis, gene expression, protein synthesis, carbon and nitrogen metabolisms. To restore the desire states of cells exposed to PFASs, plants initiate several detoxifying mechanisms, including enzymatic antioxidants, non-enzymatic antioxidants, metallothionein genes and metabolic reprogramming.

Recent findings The BTB divides the seminiferous epithelium into the basal and the adluminal compartments. The BTB is constituted by coexisting actin-based tight junction, basal ectoplasmic specialization, and gap junction, and also intermediate filament-based desmosome between Sertoli cells near the basement membrane. Junctions at the BTB undergo continuous remodeling to facilitate the transport of preleptotene spermatocytes residing in the basal compartment across the immunological barrier during spermatogenesis. Thus, meiosis I/II and postmeiotic spermatid development take place in the adluminal compartment behind the BTB. BTB remodeling also regulates exchanges of biomolecules between the two compartments. As tight junction, basal ectoplasmic specialization, and gap junction use F-actin for attachment, actin microfilaments rapidly convert between their bundled and unbundled/branched configuration to confer BTB plasticity. The events of actin reorganization are regulated by two major classes of ABPs that convert actin microfilaments between their bundled and branched/unbundled configuration. Summary We provide a model on how ABPs regulate BTB remodeling, shedding new light on unexplained male infertility, such as environmental toxicant-induced reproductive dysfunction since the testis, in particular the BTB, is sensitive to environmental toxicants, such as cadmium, bisphenol A, phthalates, and PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid or perfluorooctane sulfonate).

The hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of PFASs affect the sorption behaviour and suggest organic carbon may not be the only factor affecting sorption. We reviewed the quality of all data published in peer-reviewed literature on sorption of PFASs to critically evaluate the role organic carbon (OC) and other properties have in sorption of PFASs in soils or sediments. The largest data sets available were for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, n = 147) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS, n = 178), and these analyses showed very weak correlations between sorption coefficient (Kd) and OC alone (R2 = 0.05–0.07). When only laboratory-derived Kd values of PFASs and OC were analysed, the R2 values increased for PFOA (R2 = 0.24, n = 42), PFOS (R2 = 0.38, n = 69), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA, R2 = 0.77 n = 12), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA, R2 = 0.78, n = 13). However, the relationships were heavily skewed by one or two high OC values. Similarly there was no significant relationship between Kd values and pH for PFOS (R2 = 0.06) and PFOA (R2 = 0.07), across a range of environmental pH values. Our analyses showed sorption behaviour of a range of PFASs could not be explained by a single soil or sediment property. Multiple regression models better explained the sorption behaviour of a number of PFASs. Regressions of OC and pH together explained a significant proportion of the variation in Kd values for 9 out of 14 PFASs and 8 of these regressions had ≥10 data points. This review highlighted that at least OC, pH and clay content are properties having significant effect on sorption. There is a clear need for more data and studies with thorough characterisation of soils or sediments to better understand their role in PFASs sorption.

Due to their persistence, toxicity and bioaccumulation, ECF-associated chemicals perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (POSF) are placed into the Annex B of the Stockholm Convention (SC) on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in 2009. The ECF production has also been phased out gradually in the developed countries. However, the production of fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) by telomerization has increased significantly. Recent studies have demonstrated that the biotransformation and abiotic transformation of FTOHs yielded perfluocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), which may be router for the ubiquitous distribution of PFCAs. Besides, some of the FTOHs intermediate metabolites have been demonstrated to be able to covalently bind with various biomolecules and thereby cause serious toxicity, while the final metabolites are showed to cause hepatotoxicity and renal toxicity. Recently, the environmental problems related to FTOHs have become the hotspots in environmental science, toxicology and epidemiology.

Recent Findings: PFASs are persistent organic pollutants that have been widely produced and used in a range of commercial products since the 1950s. Human exposures to PFASs are nearly ubiquitous globally, but studies that addressed potential health effects of PFASs have only begun to accumulate in recent years. Animal studies suggest adverse effects resulting from developmental encompasses prenatal exposures to PFASs. In humans, the developing fetus is exposed to PFASs via active or passive placenta transfer, while newborns might be exposed via breastfeeding or PFAS in the home environment. Summary: Overall, epidemiological findings are consistent and suggest possible associations with fetal and postnatal growth and immune function, while the findings on neurodevelopmental endpoints to date are rather inconclusive.

rayyan-421821017,Progress on analytical methods and environmental behavior of emerging per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances,2017,1,1,,,,,,"Lin Y., Ruan T., Jiang G.",,,,,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a group of anthropogenic chemicals widely used in manufacture and daily necessities, which are contaminants ubiquitous existed in various environmental matrices and biota. Due to the persistent, bioaccumulative, long-range transport and potential toxic behaviors, production of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid was voluntarily phased out. Perfluorooctanoic acid, its salt and related compounds were also proposed to be included the Stockholm Convention. Restrictions on production and usage of PFAS chemicals have resulted in emergence of novel PFAS compounds through direct manufacturing emissions and indirect transformation pathways, and increasing attention has been focused on these alternatives. In this review, we summarized recent investigations on major groups of emerging PFASs with various molecular structures, and current analytical strategies on the identification of unknown organic fluoride components were overviewed. Four classes of emerging PFASs are covered, including short-chain perfluoroalkyl substances, cyclic perfluoroalkyl acids, perfluoropolyethers and chlorine or hydrogen-substituted polyfluoroalkyl substances. Current knowledge on molecular structures, production and application, environmental behaviors and potential biological effects are summarized, if available. Known PFASs were noticed as a small part of organic fluorinated compounds in the environment. Consequently, new analytical strategies, such as the mass balance analysis and the oxidative conversion methods, were developed for the analysis of unknown fluorinated components. Mass balance analysis of extractable organic fluorine were used to predict the content of unknown organic fluorine in various environmental matrices including sea water, soil, and human blood. Extractable organic fluorine could be exactly quantified after conversion into inorganic fluoride by high-temperature combustion, and known fluorinated components could also be measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The difference in contents between extractable organic fluorine and known fluorinated components was thus considered as components of unknown organic fluorine. The oxidative conversion method was especially superior for the analysis of fluorinated precursors such as fluorotelomer sulfonates, perfluoroalkane sulfonamides and fluorotelomer phosphate diesters, in which these poly-fluoroalkyl substances could be transformed into known perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) by reaction with hydroxyl radicals at basic conditions. The content of polyfluoroalkyl precursors could be determined by comparing the change of PFCAs contents before and after the oxidation assay. Compared with the mass balance analysis method, this oxidative conversion method require quantification of more PFAS terminal products, and it was not applicable for stable perfluorinated compounds. Meanwhile, occurrence of a variety of novel PFAS analogues have brought challenges on PFAS analysis. For instance, varied molecular structures of emerging PFASs result in distinct physical-chemical properties, which further complicate the analytical process including sample pretreatment and chromatographic isolation. Development of additional methods, such as hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) for the analysis of short chain PFASs and orthogonal liquid chromatography for the analysis of zwitterionic, cationic, and anionic fluorinated chemicals, are urgently needed. Statistical tools including mass spectrum deconvolution, peak picking, alignment and feature filtering would be promising for confirmation of novel PFAS molecular structures. Also, environmental transformation of PFAS precursors are still ambiguous. Application of strategies in metabolomics analysis might facilitate studies on degradation mechanism of PFAS chemicals. © 2017, Science Press.

In the present review, the occurrence of PFAAs and their behavior in aquatic ecosystem were summarized, and the health and ecological risk assessment and the multimedia fate simulation were investigated. PFAAs are most likely to exist in the aqueous phase, and PFAAs in atmosphere are also able to enter water bodies through diffusion and wet and dry deposition and eventually become widely distributed in various environmental media. The air-solid partition is considered to be one of the major factors in the long-distance transportation of the pollutants. The pKa values and organic carbon fraction of the sediment could influence the partition of PFAAs between water and sediment. Otherwise, PFAAs have teratogenic, mutagenic and other toxic effects and they could be accumulated by biota, and magnified through trophic level. The ecological and health risks of PFOA and PFOS were assessment. In order to explore the partition mechanism and reduce the uncertainty of the simulation of the transport, transformation and fate, the experimental methods on physicochemical properties of PFAAs should be developed.

Hypogonadism can be caused by testicular disease (primary hypogonadism) or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (secondary hypogonadism). The present strategy for treating hypogonadism is the administration of exogenous testosterone. But exogenous testosterone is reported to have negative side effects including adverse cardiovascular events and disruption of physiological spermatogenesis probably due to its inability to mimic the physiological circadian rhythm of testosterone secretion in vivo. In recent years, a growing number of articles demonstrated that stem Leydig cells (SLCs) can not only differentiate into functional Leydig cells (LCs) in vivo to replace chemically disrupted LCs, but also secrete testosterone in a physiological pattern. The proliferation and differentiation of SLCs are regulated by various factors. However, the mechanisms involved in regulating the development of SLCs remain to be summarized. Factors involved in the regulation of SLCs can be divided into environmental pollutants, growth factors, cytokine and hormones. Environmental pollutants such as Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and Triphenyltin (TPT) could suppress SLCs proliferation or differentiation. Growth factors including FGF1, FGF16, NGF and activin A are essential for the maintenance of SLCs self-renewal and differentiation. Interleukin 6 family could inhibit differentiation of SLCs. Among hormones, dexamethasone suppresses SLCs differentiation, while aldosterone suppresses their proliferation. The present review focuses on new progress about factors regulating SLC’s proliferation and differentiation which will undoubtedly deepen our insights into SLCs and help make better clinical use of them.

Results from recent cruises in the Atlantic Ocean are examined for POP distributions across ocean fronts in (i) the Canary Current; (ii) the Gulf Stream; and (iii) the Amazon and Rio de la Plata Plumes. Few studies achieved a spatial resolution of 10-20. km, while most had 100-300. km between adjacent stations. The majority of the well-resolved studies measured perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), which seem particularly well suited for frontal resolution. In the NE Atlantic, concentrations of PFCs sharply decreased between SW Europe and NW Africa upon crossing the Canary Current Front at 24-27°N. In the Western Atlantic, the PFC concentrations sharply increased upon entering the Amazon River Plume and Rio de la Plata Plume. In the NW Atlantic, concentrations of several pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are very high in Rhode Island Sound, decreasing to below detection limit in the open ocean.

Their resistance to degradation, however, means that PFAS are ubiquitous in the environment and bioaccumulate. PFAS exposure has also been linked to a variety of adverse health effects. Occupational PFAS exposure is of particular concern as research on PFAS exposure in worker populations has historically been limited and generally restricted to fluorochemical plant workers involved in PFAS production. Methods: A comprehensive review of peer-reviewed scientific literature was conducted to investigate which worker populations may experience occupational exposure to PFAS. Serum PFAS levels reported in various occupations were analyzed and compared to serum PFAS levels published on the general public exposed to PFAS-contaminated drinking water and the study population of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Results: Our analysis indicates that professional ski waxers and firefighters may be exposed to several different PFAS at levels often similar to or higher than levels among fluorochemical plant workers and individuals in communities with PFAS-contaminated drinking water, and higher than levels in the general public. PFAS serum level data on other occupations were largely absent. Conclusions: Results highlight a need for additional research on occupational PFAS exposures and concomitant environmental exposures in these populations.

Persistent organic pollutants and environmental hormones have replaced particulate matter (PM2.5) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in causing indoor air pollution. This review summarises the differences in the types and concentrations of indoor organic environmental pollutants detected in pet dogs and cats. This includes an analysis of the main exposure routes of different types of pollutants. To identify which of the two pet species are better sentinels, cats and dogs were compared based on their metabolic capacities of various indoor organic pollutants.

Pets often accumulate PBDEs from dust; however, traces of PBDEs are present in their diet. The indoor pollutant contamination levels in internal cats were generally higher than those in dogs. Cats accumulate organic pollutants associated with indoor environments, but they are sensitive to their toxicity because, unlike dogs, cats cannot metabolise most of the accumulated pollutants. Moreover, cats share similar clinical symptoms of thyroid diseases in humans.

Its accumulation in living organisms and foods has accentuated the importance of investigations into aquatic organisms at the bottom of the food chain, as the stability and integrity of the food web as well as the population quantity and structure of the aquatic ecosystem may be affected. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the toxic and toxicity-related effects of PFASs on aquatic plankton, aquatic invertebrates and microorganisms, the characteristics of different target aquatic organisms in toxicity investigations, and a feasibility evaluation of PFAS substitutes to provide valuable suggestions for further utilization and regulation of PFASs and their substitutes. © 2022 by the authors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.3390/ijerph192416729,,,

The main aim of the study was to review the current data on PFASs in human breast milk, including the challenges of analysis as well as the possible modes of transfer from maternal blood. In this paper, previously published data on the concentrations of PFASs in human breast milk from around the world were reviewed and summarised. Eligible studies with reference lists published before 1 June 2017 were included by searching several databases (including Scopus, ScienceOpen and SciFinder). From this search, studies with the number of participants in each study ranging from 2 to 1237 were identified. The review indicated that based on the structural profiles and concentration levels, there was variation in the geographical distribution of these compounds in breast milk. Although there are no recorded investigations on the modes of transfer from maternal blood to breast milk, literature suggests that the PFASs tend to be transferred through binding to various proteins. The review also examined the different sample preparation and analytical methods employed to measure the concentrations of PFASs in human breast milk. This showed that solid phase extraction was the most common extraction method. After extraction, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was the most common analysis method. Since several of these methods were initially dedicated to monitoring PFASs in food and water, they demonstrate some limitations with regard to specificity and sensitivity to human fluids. Additionally, there are currently no published records of certified reference materials and/or proficiency scheme devoted to standardising PFAS concentrations in breast milk. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s11356-018-3483-z,"Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Milk Ejection;Milk, Human",,

Recent developments in chemical analysis have revealed that fluorinated compounds have become ubiquitously spread and are regarded as a potential threats to the environment. Due to the carbon-fluorine bond, which has a very high bond strength, these chemicals are extremely persistent towards degradation and some PFCs have a potential for bioaccumulation in organisms. Of particular concern has been the developmental toxicity of PFOS and PFOA, which has been manifested in rodent studies as high mortality of prenatally exposed newborn rats and mice within 24 h after delivery. The nervous system appears to be one of the most sensitive targets of environmental contaminants. The serious developmental effects of PFCs have lead to the upcoming of studies that have investigatedneurotoxic effects of these substances. In this review the major findings of the neurotoxicity of the main PFCs and their suggested mechanisms of action are presented. The neurotoxic effects are discussed in light of other toxic effects of PFCs to indicate the significance of PFCs as neurotoxicants. The main findings are that PFCs may induce neurobehavioral effects, particularly in developmentally exposed animals. The effects are, however, subtle and inconclusive and are often induced at concentrations where other toxic effects also are expected. Mechanistic studies have shown that PFCs may affect the thyroid system, influence the calcium homeostasis, protein kinase C, synaptic plasticity and cellular differentiation. Compared to other environmental toxicants the human blood levels of PFCs are high and of particular concern is that susceptible groups may be exposed to a cocktail of substances that in combination reach harmful concentrations. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00204-012-0822-6,,,

Their widespread use makes them a potential route of exposure for certain contaminants to which human would not be normally exposed. One of these contaminants includes endocrine disrupting chemicals, molecules capable of mimicking the body's natural hormones and interfering with the endocrine system. Some of them are ingredients included in the product's formulation, such as UV-filters (sunscreens), phthalates (plasticizers and preservatives), synthetic musks (fragrances), parabens and other antimicrobial agents (antimicrobial preservatives). Others are non-intended added substances that may result from the manufacturing process or migration from the plastic packaging, as with bisphenols and perfluorinated compounds. Some of these endocrine disruptors have been restricted or even banned in cosmetics and PCPs given the high risk they pose to health. Thus, the development of fast, sensitive and precise methods for the identification and quantification of these compounds in cosmetics is a substantial need in order to ensure consumer safety and provide insight into the real risk of human exposure.

The diversity of manufactured PreFOS and its degradation products (e.g. C8F17SO2R and C 8F17SO2NR′R′′, where R is H or F, and R′ and R′′ are various) has made it difficult to track their fate. Temporal trends of PFOS in both humans and wildlife are discrepant, thus it is difficult to predict future exposure, and hypotheses about the role of PreFOS have been raised. Although abiotic degradation of commercially important PreFOS materials requires further research, current data suggest that the yield of PFOS is negligible or minor. On the other hand, in vivo biotransformation of PreFOS yields PFOS as the major metabolite, and &gt;32% yields have been observed. In Canadians, exposure to PreFOS was equivalent or greater than direct PFOS exposure prior to 2002. In most ocean water, PFOS is dominant to PreFOS, but in the oceans east of Greenland there may be more PreFOS than PFOS, consistent with the fact that whales and humans in this region also show evidence of substantial PreFOS exposure. Quantitative assessments of PFOS body-burdens coming from PreFOS are complicated by the fact that PreFOS partitions to the cellular fraction of blood, thus biomonitoring in serum under predicts PreFOS relative to PFOS. Many unknowns exist that prevent accurate modelling, thus analytical methods that can distinguish directly manufactured PFOS, from PFOS that has been biotransformed from PreFOS, should be applied in future human and environmental monitoring.

An increase in cardiovascular disease or death related to PFAS exposure has been reported from cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies with evidence concerning the relation with early vascular lesions and atherosclerosis.

We also examined the recent evidence indicating that legacy and new PFAS can be incorporated in platelet cell membranes giving a solid rationale to the observed increase risk of cardiovascular events in the populations exposed to PFAS by directly promoting thrombus formation. Exposure to PFAS has been related to altered plasma membrane fluidity and associated with altered calcium signal and increased platelet response to agonists, both in vitro and ex vivo in subjects exposed to PFAS. All the functional responses are increased in platelets by incorporation of PFAS: adhesion, aggregation, microvesicles release and experimental thrombus formation.

We found 25 published studies of the biomagnification of 35 specific PFAS, for which the TMF was generated through linear regression of individual log-PFAS concentration and the δ15N-based trophic position of each organism in the food webs. Studies were concentrated mainly in China, North America, and Europe, and the most investigated compound was perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), which was frequently shown to be biomagnified in the food web (TMFs ranging from 0.8 to 20). Other long-chain carboxylates displayed substantial variation in trophic magnification. Observed differences in the TMF were associated with length of the food web, geographic location, sampling methodologies, tissue analyzed, and distance from known direct PFAS inputs. In addition to biomagnification of legacy PFAS, precursor substances were observed to bioaccumulate in the food web, which suggests they may biotransform to more persistent PFAS compounds in upper trophic levels.

This shift in focus is a result of the rapidly increasing prevalence of ASD coupled with the incomplete penetrance of this disorder in monozygotic twins. One such area of environmentally focused research is the association of exposures to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) with elevated risk for ASD. EDCs are exogenous chemicals that can alter endogenous hormone activity and homeostasis, thus potentially disrupting the action of sex and other natural hormones at all stages of human development. Inasmuch as sex hormones play a fundamental role in brain development and sexual differentiation, exposure to EDCs in utero during critical stages of development can have lasting neurological and other physiological influences on the developing fetus and, ultimately, the child as well as adult. This review will focus on the possible contributions of EDCs to autism risk and pathogenesis by first discussing the influence of endogenous sex hormones on the autistic phenotype, followed by a review of documented human exposures to EDCs and associations with behaviors relevant to ASD. Mechanistic links between EDC exposures and aberrant neurodevelopment and behaviors are then considered, with emphasis on EDC-induced transcriptional profiles derived from animal and cellular studies.

We draw mostly on epidemiological and experimental data published in the last decade. For each chemical class considered, we deal with not only the thyroid hormone–disrupting effects but also briefly mention the main mechanisms by which the same chemicals could modify estrogen and/or androgen signalling, thereby exacerbating adverse effects on endocrine-dependent developmental programmes. Further, we emphasize recent data showing how maternal thyroid hormone signalling during early pregnancy affects not only offspring IQ, but also neurodevelopmental disease risk. These recent findings add to established knowledge on the crucial importance of iodine and thyroid hormone for optimal brain development.

The Stockholm Convention, a global agreement on POPs, came into force in 2004. There has been a major expansion of measurements and risk assessments of new chemical contaminants in the global environment, particularly brominated diphenyl ethers and perfluorinated alkyl acids. However, the list of chemicals measured represents only a small fraction of the approximately 30,000 chemicals widely used in commerce (>1 t/y). The vast majority of existing and new chemical substances in commerce are not monitored in environmental media. Assessment and screening of thousands of existing chemicals in commerce in the United States, Europe, and Canada have yielded lists of potentially persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals. Here we review recent screening and categorization studies of chemicals in commerce and address the question of whether there is now sufficient information to permit a broader array of chemicals to be determined in environmental matrices. For example, Environment Canada's recent categorization of the Domestic (existing) Substances list, using a wide array of quantitative structure activity relationships for PB&T characteristics, has identified about 5.5% of 11,317 substances as meeting P & B criteria. Using data from the Environment Canada categorization, we have listed, for discussion purposes, 30 chemicals with high predicted bioconcentration and low rate of biodegradation and 28 with long range atmospheric transport potential based on predicted atmospheric oxidation half-lives >2 days and log air-water partition coefficients ≥5 and ≤1. These chemicals are a diverse group including halogenated organics, cyclic siloxanes, and substituted aromatics. Some of these chemicals and their transformation products may be candidates for future environmental monitoring. However, to improve these predictions data on emissions from end use are needed to refine environmental fate predictions, and analytical methods may need to be developed. © 2006 American Chemical Society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1021/es061677a,,,

Opponents are concerned about exposure to hazardous chemicals leaching from the crumb rubber cushioning fill made of recycled tires, the plastic carpet, and other synthetic components. Numerous studies have shown that chemicals identified in artificial turf, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalates, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), are known carcinogens, neurotoxicants, mutagens, and endocrine disruptors. However, few studies have looked directly at health outcomes of exposure to these chemicals in the context of artificial turf. Ecotoxicology studies in invertebrates exposed to crumb rubber have identified risks to organisms whose habitats have been contaminated by artificial turf. Chicken eggs injected with crumb rubber leachate also showed impaired development and endocrine disruption. The only human epidemiology studies conducted related to artificial turf have been highly limited in design, focusing on cancer incidence. In addition, government agencies have begun their own risk assessment studies to aid community decisions. Additional studies in in vitro and in vivo translational models, ecotoxicological systems, and human epidemiology are strongly needed to consider exposure from both field use and runoff, components other than crumb rubber, sensitive windows of development, and additional physiological endpoints.

An extensive search for toxicological information in rats and mice, and a systematic search for epidemiological evidence were conducted. The linear regression coefficient (LRC) of birth weight (BrthW) on PFOA/PFOS was considered, and separate random effects meta-analyses for untransformed (i.e. not mathematically transformed) and log-transformed values were performed. Toxicological evidence: PFOA: 12 studies (21 datasets) in mice showed statistically significant lower birth/fetal weights from 5 mg/kg body weight per day. PFOS: most of the 13 studies (19 datasets) showed lower birth/fetal weights following in utero exposure. Epidemiological evidence: Sixteen articles were considered. The pooled LRC for a 1 ng/mL increase in untransformed PFOA (12 studies) in maternal plasma/serum was −12.8 g (95% CI −23.2; 2.4), and −27.1 g (95% CI −50.6; −3.6) for an increase of 1 loge ng/mL PFOA (nine studies). The pooled LRC for untransformed PFOS (eight studies) was −0.92 g (95%CI −3.4; 1.6), and for an increase of 1 loge ng/mL was −46.1(95% CI −80.3; −11.9). No consistent pattern emerged for study location or timing of blood sampling. Conclusions: Epidemiological and toxicological evidence suggests that PFOA and PFOS elicit a decrease in BrthW both in humans and rodents. However, the effective animal extrapolated serum concentrations are 102–103 times higher than those in humans. Thus, there is no quantitative toxicological evidence to support the epidemiological association, thus reducing the biological plausibility of a causal relationship. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1080/10408444.2016.1271972,,,
rayyan-421821293,Bioaccumulation of perfluorinated alkyl acids: Observations and models,2014,1,1,,,,,,"Ng C.A., Hungerbühler K.",,,,,"In this review, we consider the two prevailing hypotheses for the mechanisms that control the bioaccumulation of perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAAs). The first assumes that partitioning to membrane phospholipids, which have a higher affinity for charged species than neutral storage lipids, can explain the high bioaccumulation potential of these compounds. The second assumes that interactions with proteins-including serum albumin, liver fatty acid binding proteins (L-FABP), and organic anion transporters-determine the distribution, accumulation and half-lives of PFAAs. We consider three unique phenomena to evaluate the two models: (1) observed patterns of tissue distribution in the laboratory and field, (2) the relationship between perfluorinated chain length and bioaccumulation, and (3) species- and gender-specific variation in elimination half-lives. Through investigation of these three characteristics of PFAA bioaccumulation, we show the strengths and weaknesses of the two modeling approaches. We conclude that the models need not be mutually exclusive, but that protein interactions are needed to explain some important features of PFAA bioaccumulation. Although open questions remain, further research should include perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) beyond the long-chain PFAAs, as these substances are being phased out and replaced by a wide variety of PFASs with largely unknown properties and bioaccumulation behavior. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1021/es404008g,,,

Lipids comprised of Fatty Acids (FA) play many important roles in the physiology and life history of fishes. Toxic effects of OC are partly dependent on its bioaccumulation in the lipids of aquatic organisms due its physicochemical properties. Therefore, there is an increasing interest to investigate the gene expression as well as the presence and activity of proteins involved in FA metabolism. The attention on Peroxisome Proliferation Activate Receptors (PPARs) also prevails in fish species exposed to OC and in the transport, biosynthesis and β-oxidation of FA. Several studies have been conducted under controlled conditions to evaluate these biological aspects of fish species exposed to OC, as fibrates, endocrine disrupting compounds, perfluoroalkyl acids, flame retardants, metals and mixtures of organic compounds associated with a polluted area. However, only fibrates, which are agonists of PPARs, induce biological responses suitable to be considered as biomarkers of exposure to these pollutants. According to the documented findings on this topic, it is unlikely that these physiological aspects are suitable to be employed as biomarkers with some noticeable exceptions, which depend on experimental design.

Its long half-life in humans, indefinite persistence in the environment, and awareness of its widespread presence in drinking water make the human health assessment of PFOS a priority. While developmental, endocrine, and hepatic effects, and increased serum cholesterol are among the outcomes resulting from PFOS exposure, immunosuppression has also consistently emerged as an adverse effect. An in-depth review of the relevant scientific literature on the toxicology of PFOS has identified immunosuppression as a sensitive endpoint for PFOS toxicity. Here, we focus specifically on that endpoint and provide a detailed derivation of a Reference Dose (RfD) of 1.8 × 10−6 mg/kg/day for chronic human exposure to PFOS. This RfD is based on decreased plaque-forming cell (PFC) response in mice, an endpoint that reflects suppression of the immune response to a foreign antigen. We additionally identify two endpoints in the epidemiology literature, decreased vaccine response and increased incidence of childhood infections, that are associated with PFOS exposure and that are consistent with and support the decreased PFC response endpoint from animal studies. We provide a weight of evidence analysis integrating the evidence from animal and epidemiology endpoints. Finally, we compare this RfD to the PFOS RfD derived by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Office of Water based on a developmental endpoint. Based on this comparison, and given our assessment, the USEPA RfD does not provide sufficient protection against the adverse health effects of PFOS.

Necessarily, the behavior of PFAS in water and wastewater needs to be understood better. This study attempts to comprehensively review, analyze and discuss PFAS based on the following key aspects: (i) sources, (ii) occurrence in water and wastewater, (iii) transformation, fate and migration, and (iv) remediation technologies. Studies indicated that modern water and wastewater treatment plants cannot deal completely with PFAS and in some cases, the removal efficiency is minus -3500-fold. The main reasons are the high hydrophobicity of PFAS and presence of PFAS precursors. Precursors can account for 33–63% of total PFAS concentration in water and wastewater. Detection and identification of precursors are challenging due to the requirement of advanced analytical instrument and standard chemicals. Several technologies have been developed for PFAS remediation involving two main mechanisms: separation-concentration and destruction. The most widespread in-use technology is adsorption because it is reasonably affordable. Anion exchange resin and synthesized materials are the most effective sorbents having a sorption capacity of 100–2000 mg PFAS/g sorbent, effective within a few hours. The destruction technology such as plasma can also be a promising one for degrading PFAS to below health-based standard in 1 min. However, plasma is costly and not yet ready for full scale application. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.jwpe.2020.101393,"Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins;Poly I-C;RNA, Messenger;Poly A-U;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Polyglactin 910;Poly G;Polylysine;Poly T;Polymethyl Methacrylate",,

These results are supported by epidemiological evidence in humans and experimental evidence in animals that demonstrate numerous and varied PFAA impacts on the nervous system. However, the methods commonly used in animal models of PFAA exposure result in durations of exposure and serum PFAA concentrations in blood that may not appropriately mimic human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. If animal models lack validity, confidence in mechanistic inferences regarding PFAA exposure and brain function is reduced, limiting these studies’ utility.

This review paper aims to provide a holistic review in the emerging area of PFAS research by summarizing the spatiotemporal variations in PFAS concentrations in surface water systems globally, highlighting the possible trends of occurrences of PFAS, and presenting potential human health impacts as a result of PFAS exposure through surface water matrices. From the data analysis in this study, occurrences of PFOA and PFOS in many surface water matrices were observed to be several folds higher than the US EPA health advisory level of 70 ng/L for lifetime exposure from drinking water. Direct discharge and atmospheric deposition were identified as primary sources of PFAS in surface water and cryosphere, respectively. While global efforts focused on limiting usages of long-chain PFAS such as PFOS and PFOA, the practices of using short-chain PFAS such as perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and PFAS alternatives increased substantially.

rayyan-421821448,Recent US State and Federal Drinking Water Guidelines for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances,2021,1,1,,,,,,Post G.B.,,,,,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a class of synthetic chemicals produced for over 70 years, are of increasing concern because of their widespread environmental presence, extreme persistence, bioaccumulative nature, and evidence for health effects from environmentally relevant exposures. In 2016, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) established nonregulatory drinking water Health Advisories of 70 ng/L for individual and total concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), the 8-carbon perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) that are the most thoroughly studied PFAS. As of May 2020, 9 US states had concluded that the USEPA Health Advisories are insufficiently protective and developed more stringent PFOA and PFOS guidelines. In addition, 10 states had developed guidelines for other PFAS, primarily PFAAs. This Critical Review discusses the scientific basis for state and USEPA drinking water guidelines for PFOA and PFOS; the same principles apply to guidelines for other PFAS. Similarities and differences among guidelines arise from both toxicity and exposure considerations. The approximately 4-fold range among state guidelines (8–35 ng/L for PFOA, 10–40 ng/L for PFOS) is not large or unexpected for guidelines developed by different scientists at different time points, especially when compared with older USEPA and state guidelines that were generally several orders of magnitude higher. Additional state guidelines for PFOA, PFOS, and other PFAS are expected to become available.

PFOA is extremely resistant to environmental degradation processes and thus persists indefinitely. Unlike most other persistent and bioaccumulative organic pollutants, PFOA is water-soluble, does not bind well to soil or sediments, and bioaccumulates in serum rather than in fat. It has been detected in finished drinking water and drinking water sources impacted by releases from industrial facilities and waste water treatment plants, as well as in waters with no known point sources. However, the overall occurrence and population exposure from drinking water is not known. PFOA persists in humans with a half-life of several years and is found in the serum of almost all U.S. residents and in populations worldwide. Exposure sources include food, food packaging, consumer products, house dust, and drinking water. Continued exposure to even relatively low concentrations in drinking water can substantially increase total human exposure, with a serum:drinking water ratio of about 100:1. For example, ongoing exposures to drinking water concentrations of 10. ng/L, 40. ng/L, 100 ng/L, or 400 ng/L are expected to increase mean serum levels by about 25%, 100%, 250%, and 1000%, respectively, from the general population background serum level of about 4. ng/mL. Infants are potentially a sensitive subpopulation for PFOA's developmental effects, and their exposure through breast milk from mothers who use contaminated drinking water and/or from formula prepared with contaminated drinking water is higher than in adults exposed to the same drinking water concentration. Numerous health endpoints are associated with human PFOA exposure in the general population, communities with contaminated drinking water, and workers. As is the case for most such epidemiology studies, causality for these effects is not proven. Unlike most other well-studied drinking water contaminants, the human dose-response curve for several effects appears to be steepest at the lower exposure levels, including the general population range, with no apparent threshold for some endpoints. There is concordance in animals and humans for some effects, while humans and animals appear to react differently for other effects such as lipid metabolism. PFOA was classified as ""likely to be carcinogenic in humans"" by the USEPA Science Advisory Board. In animal studies, developmental effects have been identified as more sensitive endpoints for toxicity than carcinogenicity or the long-established hepatic effects. Notably, exposure to an environmentally relevant drinking water concentration caused adverse effects on mammary gland development in mice. This paper reviews current information relevant to the assessment of PFOA as an emerging drinking water contaminant. This information suggests that continued human exposure to even relatively low concentrations of PFOA in drinking water results in elevated body burdens that may increase the risk of health effects. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.envres.2012.03.007,Drinking,,

This study was designed to explore the association between PFCs and cognitive ability in older adults. Methods: We assessed the association between four PFCs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and self-reported limitation due to difficulty remembering or periods of confusion using data from participants aged 60-85 years from the 1999-2000 and 2003-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. We also considered whether diabetic status or diabetic medication use modifies this association in light of in vitro evidence that PFCs may act on the same receptors as some diabetic medications. Results: In multivariable adjusted models, point estimates suggest a protective association between PFCs and self-reported cognitive limitation (odds ratio, OR; 95% confidence interval, CI) for a doubling in PFC concentration: PFOS (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78, 1.03), PFOA (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.78, 1.09), PFNA (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.79, 1.04) and PFHxS (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.82, 1.06). The protective association was concentrated in diabetics, with strong, significant protective associations in nonmedicated diabetics. Conclusions: This cross-sectional study suggests that there may be a protective association between exposure to PFCs and cognition in older adults, particularly diabetics. Copyright © 2012 S.

The etiology of T1D is not fully understood but it seems multifactorial. The genetic background determines the predisposition to develop T1D, while the autoimmune process against β-cells seems to be also determined by environmental triggers, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Environmental EDCs may act throughout different temporal windows as single chemical agent or as chemical mixtures. They could affect the development and the function of the immune system or of the β-cells function, promoting autoimmunity and increasing the susceptibility to autoimmune attack. Human studies evaluating the potential role of exposure to EDCs on the pathogenesis of T1D are few and demonstrated contradictory results. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize experimental and epidemiological studies on the potential role of exposure to EDCs in the development of T1D. We highlight what we know by animals about EDCs’ effects on mechanisms leading to T1D development and progression. Studies evaluating the EDC levels in patients with T1D were also reported.

The global historical industry-wide emissions of total PFCAs from direct (manufacture, use, consumer products) and indirect (PFCA impurities and/or precursors) sources were estimated to be 3200-7300 tonnes. It was estimated that the majority (∼80%) of PFCAs have been released to the environment from fluoropolymer manufacture and use. Although indirect sources were estimated to be much less important than direct sources, there were larger uncertainties associated with the calculations for indirect sources. The physical-chemical properties of PFO (negligible vapor pressure, high solubility in water, and moderate sorption to solids) suggested that PFO would accumulate in surface waters. Estimated mass inventories of PFO in various environmental compartments confirmed that surface waters, especially oceans, contain the majority of PFO. The only environmental sinks for PFO were identified to be sediment burial and transport to the deep oceans, implying a long environmental residence time. Transport pathways for PFCAs in the environment were reviewed, and it was concluded that, in addition to atmospheric transport/degradation of precursors, atmospheric and ocean water transport of the PFCAs themselves could significantly contribute to their long-range transport. It was estimated that 2-12 tonnes/ year of PFO are transported to the Artic by oceanic transport, which is greater than the amount estimated to result from atmospheric transport/degradation of precursors. © 2006 American Chemical Society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1021/es0512475,,,

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic evidence map (SEM) is to summarize the epidemiology evidence on approximately 150 lesser studied PFAS prioritized by the EPA for tiered toxicity testing, facilitating interpretation of those results as well as identification of priorities for risk assessment and data gaps for future research. METHODS: The Populations, Exposure, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were intentionally broad to identify studies of any health effects in humans with information on associations with exposure to the identified PFAS. Systematic review methods were used to search for literature that was screened using machine-learning software and manual review. Studies meeting the PECO criteria underwent quantitative data extraction and evaluation for risk of bias and sensitivity using the Integrated Risk Information System approach. RESULTS: 193 epidemiology studies were identified, which included information on 15 of the PFAS of interest. The most commonly studied health effect categories were metabolic (n = 37), endocrine (n = 30), cardiovascular (30), female reproductive (n = 27), developmental (n = 26), immune (n = 22), nervous (n = 21), male reproductive (n = 14), cancer (n = 12), and urinary (n = 11) effects. In study evaluation, 120 (62%) studies were con-sidered High/Medium confidence for at least one outcome. DISCUSSION: Most of the PFAS in this SEM have little to no epidemiology data available to inform evaluation of potential health effects. Although exposure to the 15 PFAS that had data was fairly low in most studies, these less-studied PFAS may be used as replacements for “legacy” PFAS, leading to potentially greater exposure. It is impractical to generate epidemiology evidence to fill the existing gaps for all potentially relevant PFAS.

In this review, we summarize the results of investigations of environmental exposures evaluated in 360 free-ranging dolphins between 2003 and 2015. Bottlenose dolphins inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon, Florida (IRL, n = 246), and coastal waters of Charleston, South Carolina (CHS, n = 114), were captured, given comprehensive health examinations, and released as part of a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional study of individual and population health. High concentrations of persistent organic pollutants including legacy contaminants (DDT and other pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl compounds) as well as 'emerging' contaminants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluorinated compounds) were detected in dolphins from CHS, with lower concentrations in the IRL. Conversely, the concentrations of mercury in the blood and skin of IRL dolphins were among the highest reported worldwide and approximately 5 times as high as those found in CHS dolphins. A high prevalence of resistance to antibiotics commonly used in humans and animals was detected in bacteria isolated from fecal, blowhole, and/or gastric samples at both sites, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at CHS. Collectively, these studies illustrate the importance of long-term surveillance of estuarine populations of bottlenose dolphins and reaffirm their important role as sentinels for marine ecosystems and public health. © 2017 Inter-Research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.3354/dao03143,Risk Assessment;Environmental Health,,

PFAS are resistant to chemical and biological degradation and are ubiquitous in the environment, including in water, sediment, and biota in the Laurentian Great Lakes. This critical review evaluates the spatial and temporal variability of commonly studied perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) in the Great Lakes by synthesizing data collected in water, surface sediment, sediment cores, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and herring gull (Larus argentatus) eggs. The lowest PFAS concentrations in all matrices are detected in Lake Superior, which is located in the most pristine region of the Great Lakes Basin. In contrast, higher concentrations are observed in Lakes Erie and Ontario, which are more impacted by industrial activity and wastewater discharge. The distribution of individual PFAS compounds also varies across the lakes in response to changes in PFAS sources, with higher proportions of PFSAs in the eastern lakes. Sediment and biota are enriched in long chain PFSAs and PFCAs relative to concentrations in the water column, as expected based on predicted partitioning behavior. Sediment cores and bioarchives consistently demonstrate that PFAS concentrations increased in the Great Lakes from the initial time points until the early 2000s. The available data indicate that PFOS and PFOA concentrations decline after this period in the upper Great Lakes, but are stable in Lake Ontario. However, these trends depend on the lake, the individual compound, and the organism considered. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1039/c9em00265k,,,

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between exposure to EDCs and obesity. Data sources, design and eligibility criteria PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched from inception to 6 June 2018 for studies primarily addressing the association between exposure to EDCs after the age of 2 years and anthropometric measures of obesity or body fat. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias. Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers screened and conducted data extraction and synthesis. A third reviewer resolved disagreements. Results A total of 73 studies investigating bisphenol A (32 286 individuals), organochlorine compounds (34 567 individuals), phthalates (21 401 individuals), polybrominated biphenyls (2937 individuals), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (5174 individuals), parabens (4097 individuals), benzoic acid (3671 individuals) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (349 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Most had a cross-sectional design and low or medium risk of bias. In qualitative analysis, bisphenol A and phthalates were consistently associated with general and abdominal obesity, in children and adults, and some studies suggested this association was age-dependent and gender-dependent. Meta-analysis indicated a significant association between exposure to bisphenol A and overweight (OR 1.254, 95% CI 1.005 to 1.564), obesity (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.273 to 1.774) and increased waist circumference (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.267 to 1.783) in adults, and between exposure to 2,5-dichlorophenol and obesity in children (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1018 to 3.184). Conclusion Most observational studies supported a positive association between obesity and exposure to EDCs. Although causality cannot be determined from these data, they underscore the need to limit human exposure to EDCs in light of the evidence from animal and cell-based studies indicating the effects of these chemicals on adiposity.

Although attention to effects of exposure to mixtures of PFAS has grown in recent years, there is no consensus on the appropriate statistical methods that can be used to assess their combined effect on human health. Objectives: We aim to perform a comprehensive review of the statistical methods used in the existing studies which evaluate the association between exposure to mixtures of PFAS and any adverse human health effect. Methods: The online databases PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched for eligible studies, published during the last ten years (last search performed on April 08, 2021). Covidence software was used by two different reviewers to perform a title/abstract screening, followed by a full text revision of the selected papers. Results: A total of 3640 papers were identified, and after the screening process, 53 papers were included in the current review. Most of the studies were published between 2019 and 2021 and were conducted mainly in North America and Europe; more than half of the studies (28 out of 53) were conducted on mother and child pairs. WQS (Weighted Quantile Sum) Regression and BKMR (Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression) were used in 36 out of 53 papers to model mixtures’ effects. Health outcomes included in the studies are immunotoxicity (n = 8), fetal development (n = 7), neurodevelopment (n = 9), reproductive hormones (n = 6), thyroid hormones (n = 7), outcomes related to metabolic pathways (n = 16). Conclusion: Studies on human exposure to PFAS as complex mixtures and health consequences have substantially increased in the last few years. Based on our findings, we propose that addressing risk from PFAS mixtures will likely require combinations of approaches and implementation of constantly evolving statistical methods.

PFAS consist of a large family of synthetic chemicals, with over 4000 distinct varieties having been identified and around 250 currently being manufactured at globally relevant levels. Numerous epidemiological studies have linked exposure to PFAS with adverse health effects ranging from immunotoxicity, cardiometabolic disease, developmental and reproductive effects, cancer, and recently type 2 diabetes. Several studies have demonstrated associations between serum PFAS concentrations and glycemic indicators of type 2 diabetes including glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR in adolescent and adult cohorts. In addition, some studies have shown positive associations with incident type 2 diabetes and multiple PFAS. However, the link between PFAS exposure and the development of diabetes continues to be a disputed area of study, with conflicting data having been reported from various epidemiological studies.

The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of current exposure, fate, and potential health effects of contaminants in polar bears from the circumpolar Arctic required by the Circumpolar Action Plan for polar bear conservation. Overall results suggest that legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) including polychlorinated biphenyls, chlordanes and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), followed by other perfluoroalkyl compounds (e.g. carboxylic acids, PFCAs) and brominated flame retardants, are still the main compounds in polar bears. Concentrations of several legacy POPs that have been banned for decades in most parts of the world have generally declined in polar bears. Current spatial trends of contaminants vary widely between compounds and recent studies suggest increased concentrations of both POPs and PFCAs in certain subpopulations. Correlative field studies, supported by in vitro studies, suggest that contaminant exposure disrupts circulating levels of thyroid hormones and lipid metabolism, and alters neurochemistry in polar bears.

Owing to their persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) characteristics, PFOS has been phased out by its principal producer and the use of PFOA has been reduced. This PBT potential and a number of pollution incidents have led in recent years to an increase in studies surveying the concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in environmental waters worldwide. This paper reviews the results of these studies, as well as the monitoring that was conducted after the pollution incidents. The results of surveys suggest that PFOS and PFOA are found in environmental waters worldwide at low levels. In general, these levels are below health-based values set by international authoritative bodies for drinking water. There have been limited measurements of these chemicals in drinking water, but again these are below health-based values, except in some cases following pollution incidents. Monitoring studies suggested that where PFOS and PFOA were detected, they were at similar levels in both source and drinking water, suggesting that drinking water treatment does not remove these chemicals.

In particular, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDC) are harmful to endocrine receptor actions and signaling in the breast tissue. Usually, there is a long interval of time between the exposure to EDC and BC incidence, and this often represents a serious obstacle for effective BC prophylaxis. Notably, during certain periods of a woman’s life cycle, the BC risk is particularly elevated due to increased susceptibility to some EDC. These windows of susceptibility (WOS) include prenatal, puberty, pregnancy, and menopausal transition stages of a female’s life course. Four WOS have been considered as the most vulnerable periods for BC since the mammary gland undergoes the main anatomical and physiological transformations at those intervals. This means that during specific WOS, the EDC from the environment can have the most dangerous impact on BC risk and possible BC development later in a woman’s life. However, most clinical BC studies related to toxic environmental exposures have not been connected to the specific WOS. Therefore, the goal of this article is to briefly describe some important research results, focused on the links between EDC and BC, within four critical WOS. In addition, this mini-review outlines some useful biomarkers for further research and prophylaxis of BC and also for both the research community and the medical professionals. Conclusion: To bridge the gap in BC prevention, it is essential to recognize the links between EDC and BC within the critical WOS. Moreover, an integrative model of BC research, applying intermediate biomarkers, is necessary to determine the mechanisms of action of various EDC during critical periods in a woman’s lifespan. Hopefully, this will lead to progress in BC prevention. © 2021 Katarzyna Rygiel.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: full text checked",10.2174/1875318302111010054,Biological Markers;Breast Neoplasms,,

Notwithstanding their wide range of applications in consumer products and industrial processes, PFASs have been detected in the environment as well as in human body. Due to their potential adverse human health effects, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set the combined concentration of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water at 70 ng/L or 70 ppt (parts per trillion) as a lifetime health advisory level. Current standard detection methods for PFASs heavily rely on chromatographic techniques coupled with mass spectrometry. Although these methods provide accurate, specific, and sensitive measurements, their applications are greatly limited in advanced analytical laboratories because it necessitates expensive instrumentations, professional operators, complicated sample pretreatment, and considerable analysis time. Therefore, other detection methods beyond chromatographic based techniques, such as optical and electrochemical techniques, have also been extensively explored for simple, accessible, inexpensive, rapid, and sensitive detection of PFASs, particularly PFOA and PFOS.

In this review, we summarize recent epidemiological and molecular studies on 2 lesser-studied EDCs, the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and the parabens, the health disparities that exist in EDC exposure between populations, and their association with breast carcinogenesis. We discuss the importance of understanding the relationship between EDC exposure and breast cancer development, particularly to promote efforts to mitigate exposures and improve breast cancer disparities in socially disadvantaged populations. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

While indirect additives can be found in traces in food and come from materials used for packaging, storage, and technological processing of food, direct additives are added to food with a special purpose (canning). The use of additives is justified if it is in accordance with legal regulations and does not pose a health or danger to consumers in the prescribed concentration. However, due to the specificity of the child’s metabolic system, there is a greater risk that the negative effects of the additive will manifest. Considering the importance of the potential negative impact of additives on children’s health and the increased interest in the control and monitoring of additives in food for children, we have reviewed the latest available literature available through PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Expert data were taken from publicly available documents published from January 2010 to April 2022 by internationally recognized professional organizations. It was found that the most frequently present additives in the food consumed by children are bisphenols, phthalates, perfluoroalkyl chemicals, perchlorates, pesticides, nitrates and nitrites, artificial food colors, monosodium glutamate, and aspartame. Increasing literacy about the presence and potential risk through continuous education of parents and young people as well as active monitoring of newly registered additives and harmonization of existing legal regulations by competent authorities can significantly prevent the unwanted effects of additives on children’s health. © 2022 by the authors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.3390/ijerph192013452,Only Child;Child,,

The carbon-fluorine bond of PFAS provides desirable hydrophobic and oleophobic properties and stability that has led to widespread usage in consumer products and industrial applications. The strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also prevents appreciable degradation once released into the environment. Consequently, various household products can release volatile and nonvolatile PFAS into the indoor environment that often concentrate in dust. We discuss the diversity of PFAS in settled dust, emission sources of these chemicals, changes in PFAS profiles in dust over the past century, and the implications for human health. Recent Findings: Sources of PFAS found in dust include building materials and furnishings and consumer products used in typical indoor spaces. Daycares and workplaces are emphasized as locations with widespread exposure due to the presence of treated carpeting and industrial-strength cleaners. Comparison and interpretation of findings across studies are complicated by the different ways in which PFAS are screened across studies. We further discuss recent developments in non-targeted software for the comprehensive annotation of PFAS in indoor dust and emphasize the need for comprehensive and harmonized analytical workflows. Summary: We highlight the detection and diversity of PFAS in settled dust collected from various indoor spaces, including locations with vulnerable subpopulations. There are opportunities for future research to leverage settled dust as a sentinel environmental matrix to evaluate the link between inhalation and ingestion routes of PFAS exposure to adverse health. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s40572-021-00326-4,Prevalence;Dust,,

Results from generic multimedia box models, spatially resolved multimedia box models, and atmospheric transport models are highlighted, including conceptual investigations of cold-trap effect and global fractionation as well as results for particular chemicals, such as hexachlorocyclohexanes, DDT, polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluoroocctanoic acid, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Comparison of model results to field data shows that in many cases environmental fate models provide a good description of the distribution dynamics observed in the field, with deviations between measured and modeled concentrations around a factor of five. Sorption to atmospheric aerosols as a key process influencing the LRT of semivolatile organic chemicals (SOCs) is discussed, and the need for more measurements of the aerosol-air partitioning of SOCs and of the reactivity of particle-bound chemicals is pointed out. Key findings from field campaigns measuring legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) as well as new POPs are summarized. Finally, the relationship between science and politics in the field of POPs is addressed. Research into the LRT of organic chemicals has always occurred in interaction with political activities aiming to reduce the emissions of POPs. Since the late 1990s, the Stockholm Convention and the Aarhus Protocol on POPs have formed an important political context for research concerning POPs; the implementation of these international treaties creates a demand for ongoing research into the LRT of organic chemicals. © 2009 SETAC.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1897/08-324R.1,Organic Chemicals,,

Because of the long-term production of PFAS using ECF, which created branched isomers as byproducts in addition to the intended linear product, branched isomers of PFAS account for a significant portion of PFAS load in the environment. The distribution of isomers is not consistent in the environment, however. Geographic location appears to be a major factor in determining the isomer makeup of PFAS in surface and groundwater as well as in humans and animals. This is largely to differences in production methods; a region that produced PFAS via ECF for many years would have a higher ratio of branched isomers than one that produces PFAS using telomerization. In addition, the different structures of branched PFAS isomers as compared to linear PFAS appear to affect transport in the environment. Research suggests that linear PFAS sorb preferentially to soil and sediments, whereas branched isomers are more likely to remain in water. The higher polarity of the branched structure explains this difference. Studies in humans and animals show that most animals preferentially accumulate the linear PFOS isomer, but humans appear to preferentially accumulate the branched isomers as they are often found in human serum at percentages higher than that of ECF product. In addition, some studies have indicated that linear and branched PFAS isomers have some unique negative health associations. Very few studies, however, account for linear and branched PFAS separately. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139186,,,

However, only small number of studies can be found in the literature due to the major drawbacks associated with the GC determination of PFCAs such as high detection limits, a small range of analytes, long analysis time, and laborious derivatization prior to chromatographic separation. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS2) can overcome these limitations of GC, and therefore has become the method of choice for the determination of PFCAs since 2001. Nevertheless, GC as a low-cost and commonly available analytical technique should not be ignored because of its inherent advantage over LC to identify PFCA isomers in environmental and biological matrices owing to its high-resolution power. In addition, GC provides an opportunity to crosscheck LC–MS2 results that are often suspicious due to background contamination. This tutorial provides an overview of GC methods that have been used for the determination of PFCAs after derivatization. Moreover, performance characteristics of GC–MS are compared with that of LC–MS2. PFCAs in aqueous samples were determined by both analytical techniques, and two sets of measurements were compared using the Bland-Altman plot. For both methods, reasons for false-positive and false-negative results (overestimation and underestimation of the PFCA concentration, respectively) are discussed, and accordingly some advice is offered on how to avoid erroneous results.

There is increasing epidemiologic evidence that abnormal maternal thyroid function during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of child ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is known to disrupt thyroid function and can affect early brain development; thus, thyroid dysfunction is hypothesized to mediate this relationship.

Once these ""normal"" values have been established, the diagnosis of environmental contaminant-mediated ill-health (such as manifestations of sickness, increased mortality, a reduction in population, poor breeding success, abnormal behavior) in an individual bird or in a population could be facilitated by comparing exposure values in the investigation to reference values of the same species in the database. One might then identify the cause and pave the way for a mitigating response. The toxicant component of DABSE is being examined at the low ng ml-1 level in 200 μl of whole blood.

However, very few studies have focused on modeling PFAS in the soil-water environment. In this review, we summarized the recent development in PFAS modeling for various chemical, physical, and biological processes, including sorption, volatilization, degradation, bioaccumulation, and transport. PFAS sorption is kinetic in nature with sorption equilibrium commonly quantified by either a linear, the Freundlich, or the Langmuir isotherms. Volatilization of PFAS depends on carbon chain length and ionization status and has been simulated by a two-layer diffusion process across the air water interface. First-order kinetics is commonly used for physical, chemical, and biological degradation processes. Uptake by plants and other biota can be passive and/or active. As surfactants, PFAS have a tendency to be sorbed or concentrated on air-water or non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL)-water interfaces, where the same three isotherms for soil sorption are adopted. PFAS transport in the soil-water environment is simulated by solving the convection-dispersion equation (CDE) that is coupled to PFAS sorption, phase transfer, as well as physical, chemical, and biological transformations. As the physicochemical properties and concentration vary greatly among the potentially thousands of PFAS species in the environment, systematic efforts are needed to identify models and model parameters to simulate their fate, transport, and response to remediation techniques. Since many process formulations are empirical in nature, mechanistic approaches are needed to further the understanding of PFAS-soil-water-plant interactions so that the model parameters are less site dependent and more predictive in simulating PFAS remediation efficiency. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143793,"RNA, Messenger;Polyglactin 910;Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;Poly A-U;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Poly I-C;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins",,

However, little data exists on the effects of exposure to PFAS at environmentally relevant concentrations and this hampers the effective management of these compounds. This paper reviews current research on the occurrence and ecotoxicology of PFAS at environmentally relevant doses to assess their potential biological impacts. Hazard Quotient (HQ) analysis was undertaken as part of this assessment. Most PFAS detected in the environment were found to have a HQ risk value of <1 meaning their reported concentrations are below their predicted no effect concentration. This indicates many reported toxic effects of PFAS are, theoretically, unlikely to occur outside the laboratory. However, lack of information on new PFAS as well as their precursors and degradation products, coupled with lack of knowledge of their mixture toxicity means our understanding of the risks of PFAS is incomplete, especially in regard to sub-lethal and/or chronic effects.

All studies, except one from Arctic Finland, were either from Nunavik or Greenland. Most studies assessed polychlorinated biphenyls (n=43) and organochlorine pesticides (n=29). Fewer studies examined heavy metals, perfluorinated compounds, or polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Details of study results for each health category are provided.CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to make conclusive statements about the effects of environmental contaminants on health due to mixed results, small number of studies and studies being restricted to a small number of regions. Meta-analytical synthesis of the evidence should be considered for priority contaminants and health outcomes. The following research gaps should be addressed in future studies: association of contaminants and health in other Arctic regions (i.e. Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Nunavut, Nunatsiavut, Alaska, European North and Russian North); assessment of contaminants on chronic diseases; inclusion of clinical endpoints in assessments; and assessment of the emerging contaminants of perfluorinated compounds and polybrominated diphenyl ethers.BACKGROUND: Since the 1990s, research has been carried out to monitor environmental contaminants and their effects on human health in the Arctic. Although evidence shows that Arctic indigenous peoples are exposed to higher levels of contaminants and do worse on several dimensions of health compared with other populations, the contribution of such exposures on adverse outcomes is unclear.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to provide a synopsis of the published epidemiological literature that has examined association between environmental contaminants and health outcomes in Arctic indigenous populations.DESIGN: A literature search was conducted in OVID Medline (1946-January 2014) using search terms that combined concepts of contaminant and indigenous populations in the Arctic.

Multiple scientific studies of polar bears indicate negative relationships between exposure to these contaminants and health parameters; however, these are all of a correlative nature and do not represent true cause-and-effects. Therefore, information from controlled studies of farmed Norwegian Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and housed East and West Greenland sledge dogs (Canis familiaris) were included as supportive weight of evidence in the clarification of contaminant exposure and health effects in polar bears. The review showed that hormone and vitamin concentrations, liver, kidney and thyroid gland morphology as well as reproductive and immune systems of polar bears are likely to be influenced by contaminant exposure. Furthermore, exclusively based on polar bear contaminant studies, bone density reduction and neurochemical disruption and DNA hypomethylation of the brain stem seemed to occur. The range of tissue concentration, at which these alterations were observed in polar bears, were ca. 1-70,000. ng/g lw for OCs (blood plasma concentrations of some PCB metabolites even higher), ca. 1-1000. ng/g lw for PBDEs and for PFCs and Hg 114-3052. ng/g ww and 0.1-50 Μg/g ww, respectively. Similar concentrations were found in farmed foxes and housed sledge dogs while the lack of dose response designs did not allow an estimation of threshold levels for oral exposure and accumulated tissue concentrations. Nor was it possible to pinpoint a specific group of contaminants being more important than others nor analyze their interactions. For East Greenland polar bears the corresponding daily ΞOC and oral exposure was estimated to be 35 and 0.34 Μg/kg body weight, respectively. Furthermore, PFC concentrations, at which population effect levels could occur, are likely to be reached around year 2012 for the East Greenland polar bear subpopulation if current increasing temporal trends continue. Such proposed reproductive population effects were supported by physiological based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling of critical body residues (CBR) with risk quotients > 1 for ΞPCB, dieldrin, ΞPFC and ΞOHC (organohalogen contaminant). The estimated daily TEQ for East Greenland polar bears and East Greenland sledge dogs were 32-281-folds above WHO ΞTEQ guidelines for humans. Compared to human tolerable daily intake (TDI), these were exceeded for PCBs, dieldrin, chlordanes and ΞHCH in East Greenland polar bears. Comparisons like these should be done with caution, but together with the CBR modelling and T-score estimations, these were the only available tools for polar bear risk evaluation. In conclusion, polar bears seem to be susceptible to contaminant induced stress that may have an overall sub-clinical impact on their health and population status via impacts on their immune and reproductive systems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.envint.2010.03.002,Prednisolone,,

This paper synthesises literature about the status of the pollutants and their precursors, identifies knowledge gaps and discusses future perspectives on the study of PFASs in Africa. Limited data on PFASs prevalence in Africa is available because there is limited capacity to monitor PFASs in African laboratories. The levels of PFASs in Africa are higher in samples from urban and industrialized areas compared to rural areas. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are the dominant PFASs in human samples from Africa. Levels of PFOS and PFOA in these samples are lower than or comparable to those from industrialized countries. PFOA and PFOS levels in drinking water in Africa are, in some cases, higher than the EPA drinking water guidelines suggesting potential risk to humans. The levels of PFASs in birds' eggs from South Africa are higher, while those in other environmental media from Africa are lower or comparable to those from industrialized countries. Diet influences the pollutant levels in fish, while size and sex affect their accumulation in crocodiles. No bioaccumulation of PFASs in aquatic systems in Africa could be confirmed due to small sample sizes. Reported sources of PFASs in Africa include municipal landfills, inefficient wastewater treatment plants, consumer products containing PFASs, industrial wastewater and urban runoff.

PFCs are molecules made up of carbon chains to which fluorine atoms are bound. Due to the strength of the carbon/fluorine bond, the molecules are chemically very stable and are highly resistant to biological degradation; therefore, they belong to a class of compounds that tend to persist in the environment. These compounds can bioaccumulate and also undergo biomagnification. Within the class of PFC chemicals, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorosulphonic acid are generally considered reference substances. Meanwhile, PFCs can be detected almost ubiquitously, e.g., in water, plants, different kinds of foodstuffs, in animals such as fish, birds, in mammals, as well as in human breast milk and blood. PFCs are proposed as a new class of 'persistent organic pollutants'. Numerous publications allude to the negative effects of PFCs on human health. The following review describes both external and internal exposures to PFCs, the toxicokinetics (uptake, distribution, metabolism, excretion), and the toxicodynamics (acute toxicity, subacute and subchronic toxicities, chronic toxicity including carcinogenesis, genotoxicity and epigenetic effects, reproductive and developmental toxicities, neurotoxicity, effects on the endocrine system, immunotoxicity and potential modes of action, combinational effects, and epidemiological studies on perfluorinated compounds). © 2011 Stahl et al.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1186/2190-4715-23-38,,,

Data synthesis: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) does not occur naturally but is present in the serum of most residents of industrialized countries (U.S. median, 4 ng/mL). Drinking water is the primary route of exposure in some populations, but exposure sources are not well understood. PFOA has been used to manufacture such products as Gore-Tex and Teflon. PFOA does not break down in the environment; the human half-life is estimated at about 3 years. PFOA is not metabolized in the body; it is not lipophilic. PFOA is not directly genotoxic; animal data indicate that it can cause several types of tumors and neonatal death and may have toxic effects on the immune, liver, and endocrine systems. Data on the human health effects of PFOA are sparse. There is relatively consistent evidence of modest positive associations with cholesterol and uric acid, although the magnitude of the cholesterol effect is inconsistent across different exposure levels. There is some but much less consistent evidence of a modest positive correlation with liver enzymes. Most findings come from cross-sectional studies, limiting conclusions. Two occupational cohort studies do not provide consistent evidence for chronic disease; both are limited by sample size and reliance on mortality data. Reproductive data have increased recently but are inconsistent, and any observed adverse effects are modest. Conclusions: Epidemiologic evidence remains limited, and to date data are insufficient to draw firm conclusions regarding the role of PFOA for any of the diseases of concern.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1289/ehp.0901827,,,

The Panel determined in 2012 there was a ‘probable link’ (i.e., more probable than not based on the weight of the available scientific evidence) between PFOA and high cholesterol, thyroid disease, kidney and testicular cancer, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. Objective: Here, former C8 Science Panel members and collaborators comment on the PFOA literature regarding thyroid disorders, cancer, immune and auto-immune disorders, liver disease, hypercholesterolemia, reproductive outcomes, neurotoxicity, and kidney disease. We also discuss developments regarding fate and transport, and pharmacokinetic models, and discuss causality assessment in cross-sectional associations among low-exposed populations. Discussion: For cancer, the epidemiologic evidence remains supportive but not definitive for kidney and testicular cancers. There is consistent evidence of a positive association between PFOA and cholesterol, but no evidence of an association with heart disease. There is evidence for an association with ulcerative colitis, but not for other auto-immune diseases. There is good evidence that PFOA is associated with immune response, but uneven evidence for an association with infectious disease. The evidence for an association between PFOA and thyroid and kidney disease is suggestive but uneven. There is evidence of an association with liver enzymes, but not with liver disease. There is little evidence of an association with neurotoxicity. Suggested reductions in birthweight may be due to reverse causality and/or confounding. Fate and transport models and pharmacokinetic models remain central to estimating past exposure for new cohorts, but are difficult to develop without good historical data on emissions of PFOA into the environment. Conclusion: Overall, the epidemiologic evidence remains limited. For a few outcomes there has been some replication of our earlier findings. More longitudinal research is needed in large populations with large exposure contrasts.

Many communities have had water contaminated by PFAS, and cancer is one of the important community concerns related to PFAS exposure. Objectives: We critically reviewed the evidence relating to PFAS and cancer from an epidemiologic standpoint to highlight directions for future research that would be the most likely to meaningfully increase knowledge. Methods: We conducted a search in PubMed for studies of cancer and PFAS (through 9/20/2020). We identified epidemiologic studies that provided a quantitative estimate for some measure of the association between PFAS and cancer. Here, we review that literature, including several aspects of epidemiologic study design that impact the usefulness of study results. Results: We identified 16 cohort (or case-cohort) studies, 10 case-control studies (4 nested within cohorts and 6 non-nested), 1 cross sectional study and 1 ecologic study. The cancer sites with the most evidence of an association with PFAS are testicular and kidney cancer. There are also some suggestions in a few studies of an association with prostate cancer, but the data are inconsistent. Discussion: Each study's design has strengths and limitations. Weaknesses in study design and methods can, in some cases, lead to questionable associations, but in other cases can make it more difficult to detect true associations, if they are present. Overall, the evidence for an association between cancer and PFAS remains sparse.

Adverse pregnancy outcomes are multifactorial in nature and increasing evidence suggests that the pathophysiology behind preterm birth and preeclampsia may be similar—specifically, both of these disorders may involve abnormalities in placental vasculature. A growing body of literature supports that exposure to environmental contaminants in the air, water, soil, and consumer and household products serves as a key factor influencing the development of adverse pregnancy outcomes. In pregnant women, toxic metals have been detected in urine, peripheral blood, nail clippings, and amniotic fluid. The placenta serves as a “gatekeeper” between maternal and fetal exposures, because it can reduce or enhance fetal exposure to various toxicants. Proposed mechanisms underlying toxicant-mediated damage include disrupted placental vasculogenesis, an up-regulated proinflammatory state, oxidative stressors contributing to prostaglandin production and consequent cervical ripening, uterine contractions, and ruptured membranes and epigenetic changes that contribute to disrupted regulation of endocrine and immune system signaling. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of studies examining the relationships between environmental contaminants in the US setting, specifically inorganic (eg, cadmium, arsenic, lead, and mercury) and organic (eg, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) toxicants, and the development of preeclampsia and preterm birth among women in the United States. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.ajogmf.2021.100308,Pre-Eclampsia;United States,,

Research over the last 10 years has shown that these compounds are ubiquitous environmental contaminants they are extremely persistent, show toxic effects and accumulate in the food chain. We evaluate global, temporal and spatial trends of these important emerging contaminants. Abstract This review gives an overview of existing knowledge of polyfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) in humans and in marine biota. Temporal trends and spatial distribution of PFCs were globally compared in humans, marine mammals, seabirds and fish. In general, PFC concentrations in the environment have increased significantly from the beginning of the production up to the 1990s. After the phase-out of perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (POSF) production starting in 2000, PFC concentrations in humans generally decreased. In marine biota no clear temporal trends were observed. The temporal trends depended on the species, their trophic levels and the geographical locations. PFC patterns in humans and in marine wildlife species were compared regarding perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), their shorter and longer chain homologues (C4C15) and precursor compounds.

More than 4000 PFASs have been manufactured by humans and hundreds have been detected in environmental samples. Direct exposures due to use in products can be quickly phased out by shifts in chemical production but exposures driven by PFAS accumulation in the ocean and marine food chains and contamination of groundwater persist over long timescales. Serum concentrations of legacy PFASs in humans are declining globally but total exposures to newer PFASs and precursor compounds have not been well characterized. Human exposures to legacy PFASs from seafood and drinking water are stable or increasing in many regions, suggesting observed declines reflect phase-outs in legacy PFAS use in consumer products. Many regions globally are continuing to discover PFAS contaminated sites from aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) use, particularly next to airports and military bases. Exposures from food packaging and indoor environments are uncertain due to a rapidly changing chemical landscape where legacy PFASs have been replaced by diverse precursors and custom molecules that are difficult to detect. Multiple studies find significant associations between PFAS exposure and adverse immune outcomes in children. Dyslipidemia is the strongest metabolic outcome associated with PFAS exposure. Evidence for cancer is limited to manufacturing locations with extremely high exposures and insufficient data are available to characterize impacts of PFAS exposures on neurodevelopment. Preliminary evidence suggests significant health effects associated with exposures to emerging PFASs.

It highlights human population-based associations as well as in vitro-based experimental data to inform an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these health effects. Among the mechanisms by which PFAS may induce toxicity is via their interaction with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), nuclear receptors that regulate lipid metabolism and placental functions important to healthy pregnancies, as well as fetal and child development. Recent Findings: In utero exposure to prevalent environmental contaminants such as PFAS is associated with negative health outcomes during pregnancy, birth outcomes, and later in life. Specifically, PFAS have been associated with increased incidence of gestational diabetes, childhood obesity, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. In terms of placental molecular mechanisms underlying these associations, studies demonstrate that PFAS interfere with trophoblast lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and invasion. Moreover these effects could be mediated in part by the interaction between PFAS and PPARs, as well as other biological mechanisms.

Ubiquities and persistence of some PFAS detected in environmental samples (water, soil, air) have attracted much attention and regulatory actions in recent years. This review provides an overview of PFAS use in electronic components; trends in quantities of e-waste generation; PFAS exposure pathways during e-waste handling and processing; reported PFAS in environmental samples and samples of serum, blood, and hair collected from people living near and working at e-waste processing sites. Processes used for manufacturing electronic components (e.g., embedded processes, additive manufacturing) make recycling or materials recovery from discarded electronic units and components very difficult and unfeasible. Exposure during numerous processing steps for materials recovery and scavenging at disposal sites can result in PFAS intake through inhalation, ingestion, and dermal routes. Chemical risk assessment approaches have been continuously evolving to consider chemical-specific dosimetric and mechanistic information. While the metabolic fate of PFAS is not well understood, some PFAS bioaccumulate and bind to proteins (but not to lipids) in biota and humans due to their surface-active characteristics and very low solubility in water and fat. It is difficult to associate the adverse health effects due to exposure to e-waste directly to PFAS as there are other factors that could contribute to the observed adverse effects.

China is one of the countries with a high density of lakes in the world. Lakes play an important role in many aspects such as water supply, fisheries, and maintenance of ecosystem diversity. In addition, lakes are important sinks of POPs. The POPs in lake water can absorb and be utilized by aquatic organisms, which poses great risk to ecosystems and human health. Therefore, the distribution of POPs in lake water has an important impact on the surrounding ecosystem and human health. We collected 80 articles on the topic of POPs in Chinese lake water published from 2003 to February 2019. We collected and analyzed the published data of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDX), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated diphenyl ethers (PCDEs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and phthalate esters (PAEs). The POPs in Chinese lake water have been investigated in 49 lakes, involving 19 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China, mainly located in the eastern region (n=32), and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (n=14). There were fewer studies in the Qinghai-Xinjiang Lake District (n=3), and other areas. Among them, PAHs, HCHs and DDX were the most studied POPs. Their average concentrations of ΣPAHs, ΣHCHs, and ΣDDX in Chinese lake water were 360.0±433.8 ng/L (n=26), 12.8±23.5 ng/L (n=30), and 12.8±24.6 ng/L (n=24). The concentrations of POPs in water of eastern lakes were higher than those in lakes in other areas. Although the relative proportions of ΣPAHs, ΣHCHs and ΣDDX to the concentration of total pollutants did not change significantly before and after the year of 2010, their concentrations decreased, suggesting that the compliance with the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and the mitigation of PAHs were effective in China. The depth of water (overlying water and interstitial water), sampling location (the inlet and outlet of lakes and within the lakes) were important factors for concentrations of POPs in Chinese lake water. The concentrations of POPs in Chinese lake water were correlated with human activities such as agricultural farming, domestic sewage, industrial sewage, and docks, and the type of POPs and geographical location of the studied area. Based on the research data collected from a large number of published literatures, this review revealed the distribution characteristics of POPs in Chinese lake water, and provided a scientific basis for the control and mitigation of POPs in Chinese lakes. © 2020 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.18307/2020.0203,,,

Though they are currently being phased out, their persistence in the environment is widespread. There is increasing evidence linking PFAS exposure to health effects, an issue of concern since PFAS such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooc-tanoic acid (PFOA) bioaccumulate in humans, with a half-life of years. Many epidemiological studies suggest that, worldwide, semen quality has decreased over the past several decades. One of the most worrying effects of PFOS and PFOA is their associations with lower testosterone levels, similar to clinical observations in infertile men. This review thus focuses on PFOS/PFOA-associated effects on male reproductive health. The sources of PFAS in drinking water are listed. The current epide-miological studies linking increased exposure to PFAS with lowered testosterone and semen quality, and evidence from rodent studies supporting their function as endocrine disruptors on the reproductive system, exhibiting non-monotonic dose responses, are noted. Finally, their mechanisms of action and possible toxic effects on the Leydig, Sertoli, and germ cells are discussed. Future research efforts must consider utilizing better human model systems for exposure, using more accurate PFAS exposure susceptibility windows, and improvements in statistical modeling of data to account for the endocrine disruptor properties of PFAS. © 2021 by the authors.

We found strong evidence that multiple PFAS induce oxidative stress, are immunosuppressive, and modulate receptor-mediated effects. We also found suggestive evidence indicating that some PFAS can induce epigenetic alterations and influence cell proliferation. Experimental data indicate that PFAS are not genotoxic and generally do not undergo metabolic activation. Data are currently insufficient to assess whether any PFAS promote chronic inflammation, cellular immortalization or alter DNA repair.

Growing evidence from animal and human studies indicates that distinct time periods of heightened susceptibility to endocrine disruptors exist throughout the life course. The influence of environmental chemicals on breast cancer risk may be greater during several windows of susceptibility (WOS) in a woman's life, including prenatal development, puberty, pregnancy, and the menopausal transition. These time windows are considered as specific periods of susceptibility for breast cancer because significant structural and functional changes occur in the mammary gland, as well as alterations in the mammary micro-environment and hormone signaling that may influence risk. Breast cancer research focused on these breast cancer WOS will accelerate understanding of disease etiology and prevention. Main text: Despite the plausible heightened mechanistic influences of environmental chemicals on breast cancer risk during time periods of change in the mammary gland's structure and function, most human studies of environmental chemicals are not focused on specific WOS. This article reviews studies conducted over the past few decades that have specifically addressed the effect of environmental chemicals and metals on breast cancer risk during at least one of these WOS. In addition to summarizing the broader evidence-base specific to WOS, we include discussion of the NIH-funded Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Program (BCERP) which included population-based and basic science research focused on specific WOS to evaluate associations between breast cancer risk and particular classes of endocrine-disrupting chemicals - including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, perfluorinated compounds, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and phenols - and metals. We outline ways in which ongoing transdisciplinary BCERP projects incorporate animal research and human epidemiologic studies in close partnership with community organizations and communication scientists to identify research priorities and effectively translate evidence-based findings to the public and policy makers. Conclusions: An integrative model of breast cancer research is needed to determine the impact and mechanisms of action of endocrine disruptors at different WOS. By focusing on environmental chemical exposure during specific WOS, scientists and their community partners may identify when prevention efforts are likely to be most effective. © 2019 The Author(s).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s13058-019-1168-2,Breast Neoplasms;Environmental Exposure,,

PFOS is an environmentally persistent compound used as a surfactant and occurs as a degradation product of both perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride and substituted perfluorooctane sulfonamido components found in many commercial and consumer applications. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were given 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg PFOS daily by gavage from gestational day (GD) 2 to GD 20; CD-1 mice were similarly treated with 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg PFOS from GD 1 to GD 17. Controls received 0.5% Tween-20 vehicle (1 ml/kg for rats and 10 ml/kg for mice). Maternal weight gain, food and water consumption, and serum chemistry were monitored. Rats were euthanized on GD 21 and mice on GD 18. PFOS levels in maternal serum and in maternal and fetal livers were determined. Maternal weight gains in both species were suppressed by PFOS in a dose-dependent manner, likely attributed to reduced food and water intake. Serum PFOS levels increased with dosage, and liver levels were approximately fourfold higher than serum. Serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the PFOS-treated rat dams were significantly reduced as early as one week after chemical exposure, although no feedback response of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was observed. A similar pattern of reduction in T4 was also seen in the pregnant mice. Maternal serum triglycerides were significantly reduced, particularly in the high-dose groups, although cholesterol levels were not affected. In the mouse dams, PFOS produced a marked enlargement of the liver at 10 mg/kg and higher dosages. In the rat fetuses, PFOS was detected in the liver but at levels nearly half of those in the maternal counterparts, regardless of administered doses. In both rodent species, PFOS did not alter the numbers of implantations or live fetuses at term, although small deficits in fetal weight were noted in the rat. A host of birth defects, including cleft palate, anasarca, ventricular septal defect, and enlargement of the right atrium, were seen in both rats and mice, primarily in the 10 and 20 mg/kg dosage groups, respectively.

Toxicological studies have suggested that exposure to PFASs may lead to several adverse effects, including infertility and cancer development. In light of their widespread use, the contamination of food products has created health concerns in sites directly influenced by industrial and anthropogenic activity. In the present contribution, the current knowledge of PFAS contamination was systematically reviewed in order to provide with the knowledge gaps and main sources of contamination, as well as critically evaluate estimated dietary intake and relative risk values of the consulted studies. Legacy PFASs remain the most abundant despite their production restrictions. Edible species from freshwater bodies exhibit higher PFAS concentrations than marine species, probably due to low hydrodynamics and dilution in lentic ecosystems. Studies in food products from multiple sources, including aquatic, livestock, and agricultural, agree that the proximity to factories and fluorochemical industries rendered significantly higher and potentially hazardous PFAS contamination.

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are representatives of PFASs. Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) set the health advisory level as 70 parts per trillion for lifetime exposure to PFOS and PFOA from drinking water, based on the EPA’s 2016 Health Effects Support Documents. Then, a monograph on PFOA was made available online by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, where the agency classified PFOA as “possibly carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2B). The distinction between PFOS and PFOA, however, may not be easily understood from the above documents. This paper discussed differential toxicity between PFOS and PFOA focusing on neurotoxicity, developmental toxicity and carcinogenicity, mainly based on these documents. The conclusions are as follows: Further mechanistic studies may be necessary for ultrasonic-induced PFOS-specific neurotoxicity. To support the hypothesis for PFOS-specific neonatal death that PFOS interacts directly with components of natural lung surfactant, in vivo studies to relate the physicochemical effects to lung collapse may be required. PFOA-induced DNA damage secondary to oxidative stress may develop to mutagenicity under the condition where PFOA-induced apoptosis is not sufficient to remove the damaged cells. A study to find whether PFOA induces apoptosis in normal human cells may contribute to assessment of human carcinogenicity. Studies for new targets such as hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) may help clarify the underlying mechanism for PFOA-induced carcinogenicity. © 2016, Japanese Society of Toxicology.

The methods available for biota analysis are mostly based on three extraction procedures: ion-pair extraction, solvent liquid extraction, and alkaline digestion. The resulting extracts are then subjected to different clean-up or enrichment steps on solid adsorbents, for example graphitized carbon black, C18, and WAX phases. All methods reviewed in this work give reliable results but are partially validated only, because of the lack of certified reference materials and regular interlaboratory exercises. The few interlaboratory exercises performed on real unspiked samples did not afford satisfactory results for PFAS other than PFOS, especially for matrices with high lipid content, for example mussels.

Although microbiological contamination remains the largest cause of water-related morbidity and mortality globally, chemicals in water supplies may also cause disease, and evidence of the human health consequences is limited or lacking for many of them. Objectives: We aimed to summarize the state of knowledge, identify gaps in understanding, and provide recommendations for epidemiological research relating to chemicals occurring in drinking water. Discussion: Assessing exposure and the health consequences of chemicals in drinking water is challenging. Exposures are typically at low concentrations, measurements in water are frequently insufficient, chemicals are present in mixtures, exposure periods are usually long, multiple exposure routes may be involved, and valid biomarkers reflecting the relevant exposure period are scarce. In addition, the magnitude of the relative risks tends to be small. Conclusions: Research should include well-designed epidemiological studies covering regions with contrasting contaminant levels and sufficient sample size; comprehensive evaluation of contaminant occurrence in combination with bioassays integrating the effect of complex mixtures; sufficient numbers of measurements in water to evaluate geographical and temporal variability; detailed information on personal habits resulting in exposure (e.g., ingestion, showering, swimming, diet); collection of biological samples to measure relevant biomarkers; and advanced statistical models to estimate exposure and relative risks, considering methods to address measurement error. Last, the incorporation of molecular markers of early biological effects and genetic susceptibility is essential to understand the mechanisms of action.

Research on PBDEs has been extensively conducted in e-waste dumping sites in Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, where the PBDE levels in the environmental matrices and human bodies are relatively high. PFOS/PFOA levels are relatively low in environmental matrices and human bodies in China, perhaps because of the lower usage in China compared with North America. The recent studies have indicated the widespread occurrence of PBDEs and perfluorinated compounds in China. Usually, PBDE-209 is the predominant component of PBDEs, and PFOS is the major perfluorinated compounds in environmental samples.

In this study, the related published articles with sampling years from 2010 to 2020 were reviewed, and the concentration levels, composition characteristics and possible sources of PFASs in surface water (rivers and lakes) and precipitation in China were summarized, including those in the Tibetan Plateau region. The results show that the concentrations of PFASs in surface water in different areas of China vary greatly, ranging from 0.775 to 1.06 × 106 ng/L. The production processes of fluorinated manufacturing facilities (FMFs) and sewage discharge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPS) were the main sources of PFASs in surface water in China, and the concentrations of PFASs in water flowing through cities with high urbanization increased significantly compared with those before water flowed through cities with high urbanization. The compositions of PFASs in surface water gradually changed from long-chain PFASs, such as per-fluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA) and per-fluoro-octanesulfonic acid (PFOS) to short-chain PFASs, such as per-fluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), per-fluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and per-fluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA). The concentrations of PFASs in precipitation in China ranged from 4.2 to 191 ng/L, which were lower than those of surface water. The precipitation concentrations were relatively high around a fluorination factory and in areas with high urbanization levels. PFASs were detected in the surface water and precipitation in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is the global “roof of the world”, but the concentrations were low (0.115–6.34 ng/L and 0.115–1.24 ng/L, respectively). Local human activities and surface runoff were the main sources of PFASs in the surface water of the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, under the influence of the Southeast Asian monsoon in summers, marine aerosols from the Indian Ocean and air pollutants from human activities in Southeast Asia and South Asia will also enter the water bodies through dry and wet depositions. With the melting of glaciers caused by global warming, the concentration of PFASs in the surface water of the TP was higher than that before the melting of glaciers flowed into the surface water of the TP. Generally, this study summarized the existing research progress of PFAS studies on surface water and precipitation in China and identified the research gaps, which deepened the researchers’ understanding of this field and provided scientific support for related research in the future. The concentrations of PFASs in the water bodies after flowing through FMFs were significantly higher than those before water flowed through FMFs, so the discharge of the FMF production process was one of the main sources of PFASs in surface water. © 2022 by the authors.

In this study, we conducted a continuous monitoring program over the period 2011–2014 with seasonal monitoring in 2013 for PFAAs emitted from two rapidly developing fluorochemical industry parks located in the Daling River Basin, Northern China. The trend of PFAA contamination was identified, dominated by perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), with the maximum concentrations of 3.78 μg/L, 3.70 μg/L, and 1.95 μg/L, respectively. Seasonal monitoring uncovered the occasional emission of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). Construction trends of new facilities and associated manufacturing capacity of the main products were also analyzed to assess correlations with PFAA emissions. An assessment of the data over the period 2011–2014 found a positive correlation with fluorocarbon alcohol (FCA) production and emission of PFAAs. Groundwater and tap water around the main source indicated that the dominant PFAAs had different diffusion behaviors. PFBS levels were higher in surface water, while PFBA was dominant in groundwater and tap water, with PFOA levels being higher in downstream groundwater.

We begin in this article by reviewing the available literature on the levels of POPs over the TP. In general, the levels of most POPs are similar or lower than values reported for other background regions. However, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) levels in air and soil far exceed those measured in other mountainous areas. The East Asian monsoon, Indian Monsoon and westerly winds are responsible for the long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT) and arrival of POPs over the TP. Surface soil and vegetation act as “final sinks” for DDTs and other high molecular weight POPs. Linked to the continuous use of POPs in surrounding counties, LRAT and “cold trapping” by the TP can happen following emission–transport–deposition events, leading to the enrichment of POPs in the TP environment. Bioaccumulation of DDTs and high chlorinated PCBs have been found in Tibetan terrestrial and aquatic food chains, and newly emerging compounds such as polyfluoroalkyl substances and hexabromocyclododecanes have been widely detected in wild fish species. The corresponding ecological risks should be of great concern. Climate change, such as increased temperatures and changing coverage of snow and glaciers, has the potential to affect the behavior and distribution of POPs. Therefore, long-term monitoring data are required. Ineffective regulation regarding POPs has been reported for countries in South Asia, emissions patterns, the outflow of POPs, and their seasonal and inter-annual variability should therefore be clarified. Estimating the loading of POPs, as well as how they move, within the TP, especially under the impact of glacial melt and global warming, should be a priority. © 2016","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.08.107,,,

We performed a systematic literature review of the relevant literature of PubMed, Cochrane Library databases, Web of Science and Embase from the establishment to April 2020. Studies included the effects of PFOA on the reproductive system of male rodents. The meta-analysis was performed on the basis of the following points: level of testosterone and estradiol in serum, development of reproductive organs, pathological changes of reproduction organs and parameters of semen. A series of 16 studies was enrolled in this study. The standard mean difference (SMD) for PFOA-related reproductive toxicity was summarised as −0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71, −0.07). The lower serum testosterone levels, decreased absolute testicular and epididymal weights, higher serum estradiol levels, elevated relative testicular and seminal vesicle weights and increased incidence of Leydig cell adenoma and percentage of abnormal sperm were observed in the exposed group compared with the control group. However, no statistical difference was found in the day of preputial separation of pups and percentage of motile sperm. In conclusion, PFOA exposure heightens the reproductive system damage in male rodents. However, many studies included in the review did not identify mechanisms by which PFOA induces changes to the male reproductive system, which is an area for additional study. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128608,Rodentia,,

This paper reviews past experiences with such disposal practices and highlights their unsustainability due to the risks of contamination of ecosystems, the food chain, together with ground and drinking water supplies. The use and associated disposal of POPs have been occurring for over 50 years. Concurrent with the phase-out of some of the most hazardous chemicals, the production of new POPs, such as brominated and fluorinated compounds has increased since the 1990s. These latter compounds are commonly used in a wide range of consumer goods, and as consumer products reach the end of their useful lives, ultimately enter waste recycling and disposal systems, in particular at municipal landfills. Because of their very slow, or lack of degradability, POPs will persist in landfills for many decades and possibly centuries. Over these extended time periods engineered landfill systems and their liners are likely to degrade, thus posing a contemporary and future risk of releasing large contaminant loads to the environment. This review highlights the necessity for alternative disposal methods for POP wastes, including destruction or complete removal from potential environmental release. In addition to such end of pipe solutions a policy change in the use pattern of persistent toxic chemicals is inevitable. In addition, inventories for the location and quantity of POPs in landfills, together with an assessment of their threat to ecosystems, drinking water and food resources are identified as key measures to facilitate appropriate management of risks. Finally the challenges of POP wastes in transition/developing countries, the risk of increased leaching of POPs from landfills due to climate change, and the possible negative impact of natural attenuation processes are considered. © The Author(s) 2011.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1177/0734242X10390730,,,
rayyan-421822022,Potential role of sea spray generation in the atmospheric transport of perfluorocarboxylic acids,2010,1,1,,,,,,"Webster E., Ellis D.A.",,,,,"The observed environmental concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and its conjugate base (PFO) in remote regions such as the Arctic have been primarily ascribed to the atmospheric transport and degradation of fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and to direct PFO transport in ocean currents. These mechanisms are each capable of only partially explaining observations. Transport within marine aerosols has been proposed and may explain transport over short distances but will contribute little over longer distances. However, PFO(A) has been shown to have a very short half-life in aqueous aerosols and thus sea spray was proposed as a mechanism for the generation of PFOA in the gas phase from PFO in a water body. Using the observed PFO concentrations in oceans of the Northern Hemisphere and estimated spray generation rates, this mechanism is shown to have the potential for contributing large amounts of PFOA to the atmosphere and may therefore contribute significantly to the concentrations observed in remote locations. Specifically, the rate of PFOA release into the gas phase from oceans in the Northern Hemisphere is calculated to be potentially comparable to global stack emissions to the atmosphere. The subsequent potential for atmospheric degradation of PFOA and its global warming potential are considered. Observed isomeric ratios and predicted atmospheric concentrations due to FTOH degradation are used to elucidate the likely relative importance of transport pathways. It is concluded that gas phase PFOA released from oceans may help to explain observed concentrations in remote regions. The model calculations performed in the present study strongly suggest that oceanic aerosol and gas phase field monitoring is of vital importance to obtain a complete understanding of the global dissemination of PFCAs. © 2010 SETAC.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1002/etc.228,,,

Notably, human health risk assessment is required for risk mitigation. The lack of human health risk assessment and management may thus unreliably regulate the quality of water resources and efficiency of treatment processes. Therefore, drinking water supply systems (DWSSs) may be still unwarranted in assuring safe access to potable drinking water. Drinking water supply, such as tap water, is an additional and crucial route of human exposure to the health risks associated with EDCs. A holistic system, incorporating continuous research in DWSS monitoring and management using multi-barrier approach, is proposed as a preventive measure to reduce human exposure to the risks associated with EDCs through drinking water consumption. The occurrence of EDCs in DWSSs and corresponding human health risk implications are analyzed using the Needs, Approaches, Benefits, and Challenges (NABC) method. Therefore, this review may act as a supportive tool in protecting human health and environmental quality from EDCs, which is essential for decision-making regarding environmental monitoring and management purposes.

While such compounds have been environmentally present for some time, new pharmaceuticals and replacements for other ECs phased out due to regulatory limitations are continually being introduced to market. Non-target lower organisms are exposed through affected water, atmospheric emissions, precipitation, sediments, among other routes. Biological disruption/dysfunction (such as endocrine, developmental, and epigenetic disruption) has been reported in lower organisms exposed to trace levels of PPCPs and other ECs. Such disruption/dysfunction may not be exclusively present as traditional toxic response (e.g., cancer or death) but may only slightly alter natural biological processes as a result of exposure to an exogenous chemical (e.g., an increased heart rate or altered size of dorsal fat pads in fish). The epigenome and endocrine system appear to be relatively sensitive to many PPCPs/ECs, particularly during early development.Humans are exposed to ECs such as plasticizers and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) mainly through ingestion (food and contaminated liquid) as well as interaction with day-to-day products (detergents, musk compounds in fragrances, etc.). Few, if any, studies have investigated trace-level toxicity of such ECs to humans as direct-exposure trials are highly unethical. However, numerous epidemiological links exist between the presence of contaminants in humans (blood, urine, and tissues) and the occurrence of diseases or other phenotypic alterations. Despite mounting interest and research, such trace-level effects on humans are greatly debated and often criticized.This paper reviews the current understanding of PPCP/EC toxicity. Discussion of general biological disruption/dysfunction of the following seven classes of PPCP/ECs is included: analgesics, antibiotics, antineoplastic compounds, beta-blockers, endocrine disrupting compounds, PFCs, and plasticizers.

In this review we critically evaluate the current state of the science regarding human early life exposure processes (until 18 years of age) to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Efficient placental transfer of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) results in relatively high prenatal exposure compared with many neutral organic contaminants. The few biomonitoring studies that specifically target infants, toddlers and other children suggest relatively high serum concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in early life with peak concentrations occurring sometime before the child reaches 20 months. This peak in serum concentrations is most likely explained by exposure via breastfeeding, ingestion of house dust and/or specific contact events with consumer products leading to high body weight normalized estimated daily intakes (EDIs). Although children have higher EDIs of PFASs than adults, these are not always reflected by higher serum levels of PFASs in children in cross-sectional biomonitoring studies due to the confounding effect of age and birth cohort, and different exposure histories due to production changes. Longitudinal exposure studies measuring internal and external exposure (for multiple pathways and PFASs) at several time points during early life are strongly encouraged to understand temporal changes in exposure of individual children. A better quantitative understanding of early life exposure processes would help to improve the validity of epidemiological studies and allow informed decisions regarding setting of regulatory thresholds and appropriate mitigation actions. © 2017 The Authors","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.emcon.2017.05.001,,,

It also surveys the removal of these compounds during conventional and advanced drinking-water and wastewater treatment, predicts the relevant physicochemical properties by means of four software programs, and identifies major knowledge gaps. Notably, a number of these newly identified PFASs are potential precursor compounds of PFOS and PFOA.

Increasing evidence shows that plants are at a risk of being adversely affected by PFASs. This review concludes that PFASs are predominantly absorbed by roots from sources in the soil; besides, the review also discusses several factors such as soil properties and the species of PFASs and plants. In addition, following uptake by root, long-chain PFASs (C ≥ 7 for PFCA and C ≥ 6 for PFSA) were preferentially retained within the root, whereas the short-chain PFASs were distributed across tissues above the ground — according to the studies. The bioaccumulation potential of PFASs within various plant structures are further expressed by calculating bioaccumulation factor (BAF) across various plant species. The results show that PFASs have a wide range of BAF values within root tissue, followed by straw, and then grain. Furthermore, owing to its high water solubility than other PFASs, PFOA is the predominant compound accumulated in both the soil itself and within the plant tissues. Among different plant groups, the potential BAF values rank from highest to lowest as follows: leaf vegetables > root vegetables > flower vegetables > shoot vegetables. Several PFAS groups such as PFOA, PFBA, and PFOS, may have an increased public health risk based on the daily intake rate (ID).

Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between PFAS exposure and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the results are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFAS and MetS. We performed a systematic search strategy using three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies concerning the associations of PFAS with MetS and its clinical relevance from inception until January 2021. We undertook meta-analyses where there were five or more studies with exposure and outcomes assessments that were reasonably comparable. The pooled odd ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects models and heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 index and Q test. A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (10 studies on the general population and two studies in the occupational settings) investigated the association between PFAS exposure and MetS. We pooled data from seven studies on the general population for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and five studies for perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Predominately, most studies reported no statistically significant association between concentrations of PFAS and MetS. In the meta-analysis, the overall measure of effect was not statistically significant, showing no evidence of an association between concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS and the risk of MetS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, current small body of evidence does not support association between PFAS and MetS. However, due to limited number of studies and substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Further scrutinizing cohort studies are needed to evaluate the association between various and less well-known PFAS substances and their mixture with MetS and its components in both adults and children in different settings. © 2021 Maryam Zare Jeddi et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1515/reveh-2020-0144,"RNA, Messenger;Polyglactin 910;Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;Poly I-C;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins;Poly A-U;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases",,

Here we reviewed sorption coefficients for PFCs derived from laboratory experiments and compared these values with the gross distribution between the concentrations of PFCs in surface waters and sediments or between wastewater and sewage sludge. Sorption experiments with perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) suggest that their sorption can be described reasonably well as a partitioning-like process with an average logKoc of approximately 2.8 for PFOA and 3.0 for PFOS. However, median concentrations in sediments (PFOA, 0.27ngg-1; PFOS, 0.54ngg-1) or sewage sludge (PFOA, 37ngg-1; PFOS, 69ngg-1) in relation to median concentrations in surface water (PFOA, 3ngl-1; PFOS, 3ngl-1) or wastewater treatment effluent (PFOA, 24ngl-1; PFOS, 11ngl-1), suggest that effective logKoc distribution coefficients for the field situation may be close to 3.7 for PFOA and 4.2 for PFOS. Applying lab-based logKoc distribution coefficients can therefore result in a serious overestimation of PFC concentrations in water and in turn to an underestimation of the residence time of PFOA and PFOS in contaminated soils.

Another possibility may be that most BC studies are skewed towards individuals at average risk, which may limit the ability to detect signals from ECE. Objectives: We reviewed the literature on ECE and BC focusing on three types of studies or subgroup analyses based on higher absolute BC risk: BC family history (Type 1); early onset BC (Type 2); and/or genetic susceptibility (Type 3). Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed database to identify epidemiologic studies examining ECE and BC risk published through June 1, 2019. Results: We identified 100 publications in 56 unique epidemiologic studies. Of these 56 studies, only 2 (3.6%) were enriched with BC family history and only 11% of studies (6/56) were specifically enriched with early onset cases. 80% of the publications from these 8 enriched studies (Type 1: 8/10 publications; Type 2: 8/10 publications) supported a statistically significant association between ECE and BC risk including studies of PAH, indoor cooking, NO2, DDT; PCBs, PFOSA; metals; personal care products; and occupational exposure to industrial dyes. 74% of Type 3 publications (20/27) supported statistically significant associations for PAHs, traffic-related air pollution, PCBs, phthalates, and PFOSAs in subgroups of women with greater genetic susceptibility due to variants in carcinogen metabolism, DNA repair, oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis and tumor suppressor genes. Discussion: Studies enriched for women at higher BC risk through family history, younger age of onset and/or genetic susceptibility consistently support an association between an ECE and BC risk. In addition to measuring exposures during WOS, designing studies that are enriched with women at higher absolute risk are necessary to robustly measure the role of ECE on BC risk. © 2020 The Authors","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.envres.2020.109346,Environmental Exposure;Breast Neoplasms,,

The immunotoxicity of these environmental toxicants are well acknowledged and a few studies have focused on the relationship between environmental toxicant exposure and vaccine antibody potency or immunoglobulin (Ig) levels in children. Altered antibody titers or Ig levels in post-vaccination children were correlated with these environmental exposures; however, the effects of environmental toxicants on post-vaccination antibody potency or Ig levels in children have not been summarized. The objectives of this systematic review are therefore 1) to summarize the current studies concerning the associations of early-life exposure to environmental toxicants with vaccine antibody potency or Ig levels in children; and 2) to analyze the possible mechanisms underlying exposure-related alterations of antibody titers or Ig levels against different vaccines. We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database for relevant literature with the key terms and included articles up to September 30, 2020. Based on the eligibility criteria, 28 articles were selected. These studies investigated the associations of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (5 studies), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) (6 studies), other OPs (4 studies), heavy metals (11 studies) and air pollutants, e.g. PM2.5, (3 studies) with the serum-specific antibody concentrations or Ig levels against different vaccines, such as anti-Hib, tetanus, diphtheria toxoid, IgA, IgE, etc. These studies suggest that exposure to these toxicants is generally associated with decreased potency of antibodies produced from childhood immunizations and overall deficiency in vaccines' provided protection. This systematic review provides evidence that exposure-induced changes to humoral immune-related tissue/cells/molecules response to vaccines may play predominant roles in the inverse associations between antibody responsiveness to vaccines and environmental toxicants. This review could thus also help us to conduct better immunization policies for children under environmental toxicant burdens. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146714,Immunoglobulins;Vaccination;Immunoglobulin D;Immunoglobulin M;Immunoglobulin G;Immunoglobulin Variable Region;Immunoglobulin A;Immunoglobulin E,,

Known causes of these diseases include anomalous immune responses and allergic inflammatory reactions, but the causes of allergic diseases in childhood are complex. Data sources: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Science were searched for articles focusing on environmental exposure during pregnancy and the risk of childhood allergic diseases, including asthma and atopic dermatitis, and the possible underlying mechanism. Results: In terms of environmental factors, allergic diseases in childhood are closely related to environmental chemical exposure during pregnancy, including bisphenols, phthalates acid esters, perfluorochemicals, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and polychlorinated biphenyls. However, allergic diseases in childhood are also closely associated with maternal dietary nutrition, maternal intake of drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), paracetamol and antibiotics, and maternal lifestyle. Conclusions: Several harmful environmental factors during pregnancy can result in the interruption of the function of helper T cells (Th1/Th2), cytokines and immunoglobulins and may activate allergic reactions, which can lead to allergic diseases during childhood. © 2021, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s12519-021-00448-7,Pregnancy;Environmental Exposure,,

The very large number of CECs reported in the literature makes it difficult to interpret potential risks as well as the removal efficiencies, especially for the more recalci-trant compounds. As such, there is a need for indicator compounds that are representative of CECs detected in systems worldwide. In an effort to develop such a list, five criteria were used to address the potential for applying indicator compounds; these criteria include usage, occurrence, resistance to treatment, persistence, and physicochemical properties that shed light on the potential degradability of a class of compounds. Additional constraints applied included the feasibility of procuring and analyzing compounds. In total, 22 CECs belonging to 13 groups were selected as indicator compounds. These compounds include acetaminophen and ibuprofen (analgesic); erythromycin, sulfamethox-azole, and trimethoprim (antibiotics); diazepam and fluoxetine (antidepressants); carbamazepine (antiepileptic); atenolol and propranolol (β-blockers); gemfibrozil (blood lipid regulator); tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP) (fire retardant); cotinine (nicotine metabolite); atrazine, metolachlor, and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) (pesticides); 17β-estradiol and cholesterol (steroids); caffeine (psychomotor stimulant); perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (surfactants); and iopromide (X-ray contrast agent). These thirteen groups of compounds represent CECs with the greatest resistance to treatment processes, most persistent in surface waters, and detected with significant frequency throughout the water cycle. Among the important implications of using indicator compounds are the ability to better understand the efficacy of treatment processes as well as the transport and fate of these compounds in the environment. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we review reported internal exposure levels of various HOPs (organochlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, short- and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) in placenta, and both maternal and umbilical cord sera. We also present analyses of the transplacental transfer and placental distribution characteristics of each class of compounds, and discuss effects of several factors on the transfer and accumulation efficiencies of HOPs, as well as the main mechanisms of HOPs’ transfer across the placental barrier. Reported compound-specific transplacental transfer efficiencies and distribution efficiencies, expressed as umbilical cord:maternal serum and placental:maternal serum concentration ratios (RCM and RPM, respectively), are summarized. Average published RCM values of the HOPs range from 0.24 to 3.08 (lipid-adjusted) and from 0.04 to 3.1 (based on wet weights), and are highest for perfluoroalkylcarboxylates (PFCAs) and tetrabromobisphenol A. Average published RPM values range from 0.14 to 1.02 (lipid-adjusted) and from 0.30 to 1.4 (based on wet weights). The broad RCM and RPM ranges may reflect effects of various factors, inter alia physicochemical properties of HOPs, metabolic capacities of mothers and fetuses, placental maturity, and differential expression of influx/efflux transporters in the placenta. Generally, HOPs’ RCM values decline linearly with molecular size, and are curvilinearly related to solubility. Plasma protein binding affinity and the difference between maternal and fetal metabolic capacities may also affect some HOPs’ transfer efficiencies. HOPs’ molecular size may be influential. Transplacental transport of HOPs likely occurs mostly through passive diffusion, although influx/efflux transporters expressed on maternal and/or fetal sides of the placenta may also facilitate or hinder their transport. Overall, the review highlights clear gaps in our understanding of mechanisms involved in HOPs’ transplacental transport. © 2020 The Author(s)","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.envint.2020.106224,,,

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging contaminants with the characteristics of persistence and bioaccumulation. PFAS exposure can affect the function of the nervous, endocrine, and immune system of animals and humans. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the epidemiological studies investigating potential relationships between PFAS exposure and vaccine antibody levels, and assessed whether PFAS would affect vaccine response in healthy children. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases up to February 2022. We chose studies that measured serum vaccines antibodies and PFAS concentrations of the participants. Essential information, including mean difference of percentage change, regression coefficient, odds ratio, Spearman correlation coefficient, and 95% confidence intervals, were extracted from the selected studies to conduct descriptive analysis and meta-analysis where appropriate. The qualities of these studies were evaluated as well. Finally, nine epidemiological studies about children met our inclusion criteria. A high degree of heterogeneity is observed in terms of breastfeeding time, confounder control, and detection method. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level in children without heterogeneity by Cochran's Q test (p = 0.26; p = 0.55), and exposure to perfluorohexane sulfonate is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level but with heterogeneity (p = 0.04). This comprehensive review suggests that PFAS can have adverse health effects on children by hindering the production of vaccine antibodies. There are some consistent and negative associations between children exposure to certain PFAS and tetanus antibody level.

Carotid artery atherosclerosis has been related to elevated levels of mainly highly chlorinated PCBs and to highly fluorinated PFASs, but in this case only in women. Both cross-sectional and prospective studies have shown dioxins, PCBs, as well as PFASs to be linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. In conclusion, as highlighted in this review, several lines of evidence support the view that POPs of different chemical classes could be linked to lipid abnormalities, carotid atherosclerosis and overt CVD like myocardial infarction and stroke. © 2020 The Korean Society of Lipid and Atherosclerosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.12997/jla.2020.9.3.334,Cardiovascular Diseases,,
rayyan-421822223,Assfociations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with lower birth weight: An evaluation of potential confounding by glomerular filtration rate using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK),2015,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been associated with lower birth weight in epidemiologic studies. This association could be attributable to glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is related to PFAS concentration and birth weight. OBJECTIVES: We used a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of pregnancy to assess how much of the PFAS–birth weight association observed in epidemiologic studies might be attributable to GFR. METHODS: We modified a PBPK model to reflect the association of GFR with birth weight (estimated from three studies of GFR and birth weight) and used it to simulate PFAS concentrations in maternal and cord plasma. The model was run 250,000 times, with variation in parameters, to simulate a population. Simulated data were analyzed to evaluate the association between PFAS levels and birth weight due to GFR. We compared simulated estimates with those from a meta-analysis of epidemiologic data. RESULTS: The reduction in birth weight for each 1-ng/mL increase in simulated cord plasma for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was 2.72 g (95% CI: –3.40, –2.04), and for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was 7.13 g (95% CI: –8.46, –5.80); results based on maternal plasma at term were similar. Results were sensitive to variations in PFAS level distributions and the strength of the GFR–birth weight association. In comparison, our meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies suggested that each 1-ng/mL increase in prenatal PFOS and PFOA levels was associated with 5.00 g (95% CI: –21.66, –7.78) and 14.72 g (95% CI: –8.92, –1.09) reductions in birth weight, respectively. CONCLUSION: Results of our simulations suggest that a substantial proportion of the association between prenatal PFAS and birth weight may be attributable to confounding by GFR and that confounding by GFR may be more important in studies with sample collection later in pregnancy. © 2015 Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis to identify the association between PFAS and the risk of GDM. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for appropriate articles about the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of GDM before September 28, 2020. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized by Stata 16.0 through fixed effect models according to heterogeneity. We also carried out subgroup analyses by geographic location, blood sampling time of subjects, method of chemical analysis, study design, sample size, and sampling year. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the robustness of the results. Results: A total of eight studies involving 5654 pregnant women were included in the meta-analysis. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was positively and significantly associated with the risk of GDM (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02–1.59). Exposure to other types of PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of GDM with the pooled effect estimates of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86–1.09), 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86–1.24), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55–1.16) respectively. Conclusion: We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and GDM and found that PFOA concentration was significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of GDM in public health.

rayyan-421822225,Association between perfluoroalkyl substances exposure and thyroid function in adults: A meta-analysis,2018,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"Objective Many people are exposed to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) because these substances are widely used as industrial products. Although epidemiological studies suggest that PFASs can disrupt thyroid hormones, the association between PFAS exposure and thyroid function remains inconclusive. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and thyroid hormones. Methods We searched medical literature databases for articles on the association between PFASs–perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS)–and thyroid hormone levels in adults. Twelve articles were included in the meta-analysis, and the pooled z values were calculated with correlation or regression coefficients. Results The blood PFOS concentration was positively correlated with free T4. The pooled z value was 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03, 0.08). PFOS was negatively correlated with total T4 and total T3 when excluding outlier studies. In a subgroup analysis stratified by mean PFOS concentration, PFOS was observed to be positively associated with free T4 and TSH and negatively associated with total T3 in the intermediate concentration group (8–16 ng/mL). PFOA concentration was negatively correlated with total T4 (z value, -0.06; 95% CI: -0.09, -0.03) after omitting one outlier study. PFHxS also showed a negative correlation with total T4 (z value, -0.04; 95% CI: -0.07, -0.01). A subgroup analysis of pregnant women showed that there was no association between PFASs and thyroid hormones. Conclusions Our meta-analysis suggests that PFASs are negatively associated with total T4, and their effect can be different depending on the PFAS concentration. © 2018 Kim et al.

PFAS exposure has been linked to adverse health effects such as low infant birth weights, cancer, and endocrine disruption, though increasingly studies have demonstrated that they may perturb metabolic processes and contribute to dysfunction. This scoping review summarizes the chemistry of PFAS exposure and the epidemiologic evidence for associations between exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and the development of diabetes, hyperglycemia, and/or insulin resistance. We identified 11 studies on gestational diabetes mellitus, 3 studies on type 1 diabetes, 7 studies on type 2 diabetes, 6 studies on prediabetes or unspecified diabetes, and 15 studies on insulin resistance or glucose tolerance using the SCOPUS and PubMed databases. Approximately 24 reported positive associations, 9 negative associations, 2 non-linear associations, and 2 inverse associations, and 8 reported no associations found between PFAS and all diabetes search terms.

The aim of the present study was to systematically review and evaluate the human evidence on the associations between internal levels of POPs and in vitro Fertilization (IVF) outcomes among women. We applied a protocol based on the National Toxicology Program Office of Health Assessment and Translation's guidelines for the study search, selection and quality assessment. Fifteen studies were finally retained in the present work. The results showed that main families of POPs are still pervasive in follicular fluid and serum of women undergoing IVF treatments. Globally, we found inconsistent findings across studies for specific exposure-outcome dyads, suggesting that adverse effects of POPs on IVF outcomes cannot be ruled out. Specifically, there is evidence that POPs, notably some polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides, may impair embryo quality and pregnancy rates. Most studies have been performed in small cohorts (n<50) and focused on PCBs and OCPs, whereas major research gaps remain for emerging compounds (e.g. perfluoroalkylated substances) and the most clinically relevant outcome, live birth rate. The overall evidence presented ‘serious’ or ‘very serious’ risk of bias, mainly due to the lack of consideration of relevant confounding variables, low sample size or underreporting of methods. Globally, we judged the level of evidence being “low”.

Most people in developed countries have detectable serum concentrations. Lower birth weight has been associated with serum PFOS in studies world-wide, many of which have been published only recently. Methods: To facilitate a causal assessment of the birth weight and PFOS association, we updated previous meta-analyses of the association and employed a method that facilitated inclusion of all available data in one analysis. Our analysis was based on observations from 29 studies. Results: The random effects summary was -3.22 g/ng/ml (95% confidence interval [CI] = -5.11, -1.33). In a subgroup analysis stratified by when in pregnancy the PFOS concentration was measured, the summary for the early group was -1.35 (95% CI = -2.33, -0.37) and for the later group was -7.17 (95% CI = -10.93, -3.41). In a meta-regression model including a term for timing of blood draw, the intercept was slightly positive but essentially zero (0.59 g/ng/ml, 95% CI = -1.94, 3.11). In other words, the model indicated that when blood was drawn at the very beginning of pregnancy, there was essentially no relation of birth weight to PFOS. The results from the subgroup analyses differed from those from the model because the average gestational age at blood draw in the early group was 14 weeks, when bias would still be expected. A stronger inverse association in Asian studies was not completely explained by their blood draws being from later in pregnancy.

They cause a range of adverse effects to human health and the environment around the world. There is growing concern that POPs may increase breast cancer risk due to their xenoestrogenic properties. The aim of this systematic literature review is to summarize and integrate the risks of breast cancer following environmental exposure to POPs (other than DDT) from primary epidemiological studies published between 2006 and 2015. After searching various databases, 14 case-control studies and one cohort study were included. Evidence of an association between increased breast cancer risk and environmental exposure to these chemicals is inconsistent and inadequate to conclude with certainty. However, most of the studies have examined exposure to the pollutants after diagnosis of breast cancer, overlooking exposure during critical windows of vulnerability. They have also largely focused on individual chemicals but ignored the combined effects of different chemicals. Therefore, major data gaps remain in examining exposure during critical windows of vulnerability and assessing combined effects of multiple chemicals. Development of better exposure assessment methods addressing these gaps is required for future research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: full text checked",10.1007/s11356-016-7577-1,Breast Neoplasms;Neoplasms,,

At the same time, remarkable shifts in the regulations governing the composition of some consumer products that contain endocrine disruptors (EDs) has occurred. However, important questions remain as to the weight of evidence linking EDs to human health end points. In this review, we critically examine the literature linking ED exposures to child neurodevelopment, focusing in particular on two model exposures to demonstrate issues related to bioaccumulative [e. g., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)] and rapidly metabolized (e. g., phthalates) compounds, respectively. Issues of study design, confounding, and exposure measurement are considered. Given widespread exposure to these compounds, the potential public health consequences of even small effects on human health are substantial.

We systematically searched the U.S. indoor dust literature on phthalates, replacement flame retardants (RFRs), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), synthetic fragrances, and environmental phenols and estimated pooled geometric means (GMs) and 95% confidence intervals for 45 chemicals measured in ≥3 data sets. In order to rank and contextualize these results, we used the pooled GMs to calculate residential intake from dust ingestion, inhalation, and dermal uptake from air, and then identified hazard traits from the Safer Consumer Products Candidate Chemical List. Our results indicate that U.S. indoor dust consistently contains chemicals from multiple classes. Phthalates occurred in the highest concentrations, followed by phenols, RFRs, fragrance, and PFASs. Several phthalates and RFRs had the highest residential intakes. We also found that many chemicals in dust share hazard traits such as reproductive and endocrine toxicity. We offer recommendations to maximize comparability of studies and advance indoor exposure science.

These tissue concentrations may then be compared with in vitro bioactivity assays to perhaps identify mechanisms relevant to the lowest observed effect level (LOEL) dose group and the onset of the observed in vivo toxicity. Here, we examine the perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS). We analyzed 9 in vivo toxicity studies for PFOA and 13 in vivo toxicity studies for PFOS. Both PFCs caused multiple effects in various test species, strains, and genders. We used a Bayesian pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling framework to incorporate data from 6 PFOA PK studies and 2 PFOS PK studies (conducted in 3 species) to predict dose metrics for the in vivo LOELs and no observed effect levels (NOELs). We estimated PK parameters for 11 combinations of chemical, species, strain, and gender. Despite divergent study designs and species-specific PK, for a given effect, we found that the predicted dose metrics corresponding to the LOELs (and NOELs where available) occur at similar concentrations. In vitro assay results for PFOA and PFOS from EPA's ToxCast project were then examined. We found that most in vitro bioactivity occurs at concentrations lower than the predicted concentrations for the in vivo LOELs and higher than the predicted concentrations for the in vivo NOELs (where available), for a variety of nonimmunological effects. These results indicate that given sufficient PK data, the in vivo LOELs dose regimens, but not necessarily the effects, could have been predicted from in vitro studies for these 2 PFCs. © The Author 2013.

We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database for relevant literature conducted up to September 18, 2019 with some key terms. From the initial 155 artides, 15 artides met the inclusion and exclusion aiteria, and consist of highly heterogeneous research methods. Seven studies assessed the effects of multiple environmental pollutants (metals, organic pollutants, nicotine, air pollutants) on the maternal urine and blood metabolomic profile; five studies evaluated the effects of arsenic, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), nicotine, and ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on the cord blood metabolomic profile; and one study assessed the effects of smoking exposure on the amniotic fluid metabolomic profile. The alteration of metabolic pathways in these studies mainly involve energy metabolism, hormone metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation. No population study investigated the association between environmental toxicants and placental metabolomics. This systematic review provides evidence that prenatal exposure to a variety of environmental pollutants can affect maternal and fetal metabolomic characteristics. Integration of environmental toxicant exposure and metabolomics data in maternal-fetal samples is helpful to understand the interaction between toxicants and metabolites, so as to reveal the pathogenesis of fetal disease or diseases of fetal origin.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between early life exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and ADHD in a collaborative study including nine European population-based studies, encompassing 4,826 mother–child pairs. METHODS: Concentrations of PFOS and PFOA were measured in maternal serum/plasma during pregnancy, or in breast milk, with different timing of sample collection in each cohort. We used a validated pharmacokinetic model of pregnancy and lactation to estimate concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in children at birth and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of age. We classified ADHD using recommended cutoff points for each instrument used to derive symptoms scores. We used multiple imputation for missing covariates, logistic regression to model the association between PFAS exposure and ADHD in each study, and combined all adjusted study-specific effect estimates using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 399 children were classified as having ADHD, with a prevalence ranging from 2.3% to 7.3% in the studies. Early life exposure to PFOS or PFOA was not associated with ADHD during childhood [odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 0.96 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.06) to 1.02 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.11)]. Results from stratified models suggest potential differential effects of PFAS related to child sex and maternal education. CONCLUSION: We did not identify an increased prevalence of ADHD in association with early life exposure to PFOS and PFOA. However, stratified analyses suggest that there may be an increased prevalence of ADHD in association with PFAS exposure in girls, in children from nulliparous women, and in children from low-educated mothers, all of which warrant further exploration. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5444. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The immunotoxicity of EDCs involves many mechanisms altering gene expression that depend on the activation of nuclear receptors such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the estrogen receptor (ER), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which also results in skin and intestinal disorders, microbiota alterations and inflammatory diseases. This systematic review aims to review different mechanisms of immunotoxicity and immunomodulation of T cells, focusing on T regulatory (Treg) and Th17 subsets, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) caused by specific EDCs such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), bisphenols (BPs) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). To achieve this objective, a systematic study was conducted searching various databases including PubMed and Scopus to find in-vitro, in-vivo, and biomonitoring studies that examine EDC-dependent mechanisms of immunotoxicity. While doing the systematic review, we found species- and cell-specific outcomes and a translational gap between in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. Finally, an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework is proposed, which explains mechanistically toxicity endpoints emerging from different EDCs having similar key events and can help to improve our understanding of EDCs mechanisms of immunotoxicity. In conclusion, this review provides insights into the mechanisms of immunotoxicity mediated by EDCs and will help to improve human health risk assessment. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1080/10408444.2021.2009438,,,
rayyan-421822239,Effects of Environmental Contaminants in Inflammatory Bowel Disease ; A Systematic Review,2020,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"Introduction: The Inflammatory Bowel Disease is characterized by a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and it has two important forms: Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Although the pathophysiology of the disease is mostly unknown, an interaction between immune system, genetics, microbiome and environmental factors seem to be responsible for the disease onset. The role of environmental factors in the pathophysiology of this disease is reinforced if we consider the rapid growth in incidence and prevalence rates of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in areas where the incidence was low as for example Asia. However, the literature on the role of environmental factors in Inflammatory Bowel Disease is reduced and not systematized. Objectives: To study the effect of environmental contaminants on Inflammatory Bowel Disease through a systematic review of the literature. Methods: For this systematic review the methodology ""Navigation Guide Method for Grading Human Evidence"" was used. The research was carried out in three databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed / MEDLINE). The inclusion criteria used were: research articles with original human data, clinically diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease, quantification of environmental contaminants and study of the association between environmental contaminants and Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Only written articles Portuguese, English, French or Spanish were included. Results: Sixteen studies were included in this systematic review. Of these, 13 studied Inflammatory Bowel Disease in general, 2 studies included only patients with Crohn's Disease and 1 study included only patients with Ulcerative Colitis. The most studied environmental contaminants were sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, perfluorooctanoic acid, aluminum, iron, zinc, copper, titanium dioxide, silicates and endotoxins. We also identified different categories, 4 studies on the effects of air pollution, 3 on the intake of contaminated water, 3 on the effects of diet. Additionally, 2 studies evaluated the serum concentrations of contaminants, 1 studied the impact of exposure to house dust, 2 tried to characterize cells of patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and in one study colitis was induced. Overall, the quality of evidence is moderate to low, and there is inadequate evidence on the effect of environmental contaminants on Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Discussion: In this systematic review, we have identified different classes of environmental contaminants, but studies analyzing the concentration of environmental contaminants in biological matrices are rare. Given the different confounding factors that were not taken into account and the variability between studies it is difficult to draw conclusions on the real role of environmental contaminants on the onset of Inflammatory Bowel Disease or in flares. Conclusion: Based on a moderate to low level of quality, the available evidence gathered in this systematic review is insufficient to access the effects of environmental contaminants Inflammatory Bowel Disease. New epidemiological studies are necessary. ; Introdução: A Doença Inflamatória Intestinal é caracterizada por uma inflamação crónica do trato gastrointestinal e possui duas formas importantes: Doença de Crohn e Colite Ulcerosa.

Apenas artigos escritos português, inglês, francês ou espanhol foram incluídos. Resultados: Foram incluídos nesta revisão sistemática 16 estudos. Destes, 13 estudaram a Doença Inflamatória Intestinal com referências para a Doença de Crohn e Colite Ulcerosa, 2 estudos incluem apenas pacientes com Doença de Crohn e 1 apenas pacientes com Colite Ulcerosa. Os contaminantes ambientais mais estudados foram dióxido de enxofre, dióxido de nitrogénio, monóxido de carbono, material particulado, ácido perfluorooctanóico, alumínio, ferro, zinco, cobre, dióxido de titânio, silicatos e endotoxinas. Identificamos também grupos de estudo, 4 relacionados com poluição do ar, 3 relacionados com a ingestão de água contaminada 3 relacionados com a dieta, 2 em que as concentrações séricas de contaminantes foram avaliadas, 1 estudou a exposição a pó doméstico, 2 tentaram caracterizar células de pacientes com Doença Inflamatória Intestinal e num estudo tentaram induzir colite. De uma forma geral, a qualidade do corpo de evidência é moderada a baixa, e o efeito dos contaminantes ambientais na Doença Inflamatória Intestinal não foi comprovado. Discussão: Nesta revisão sistemática, identificamos várias classes diferentes de contaminantes ambientais, mas estudos que analisam a concentração real de contaminantes ambientais em matrizes biológicas são raros. Considerando os vários fatores de confundimento que não foram tidos em consideração e a variabilidade entre estudos, torna-se difícil extrair conclusões sobre a influência destes contaminantes no início da Doença Inflamatória Intestinal ou em crises. Conclusão: Com base num nível de qualidade moderado a baixo, a evidência reunida nesta revisão sistemática é insuficiente para avaliar o efeito dos contaminantes ambientais na doença inflamatória intestinal, pelo que novos estudos epidemiológicos necessitam ser realizados.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1080/07853890.2018.1561618,Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,,
rayyan-421822240,Effects of Maternal Reproductive Investment on Sex-Specific Pollutant Accumulation in Seabirds: A Meta-Analysis,2019,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"Avian egg production demands resources such as lipids and proteins. Relative egg size and mass varies across species, reflecting differences in maternal investment. This variability may affect the maternal transfer of anthropogenic pollutants including lipophilic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and protein-associated per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mercury (Hg). We conducted a meta-analysis on seabirds and investigated whether interspecies variation in maternal investment contributes toward skewed pollutant concentration ratios between males and females, as Cmale/Cfemale (80 studies). Overall concentrations of PCBs and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were 1.6 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, in males than females, whereas mercury was similar between sexes. Few studies compared females and eggs (n = 6), highlighting a knowledge gap. We found that an increasing maternal investment as a clutch-to-female mass ratio resulted in lower PCB concentrations in females than in males during the incubation period, but no sex-specific differences were observed for mercury and PFOS. Egg production is both a lipid dominated and protein-limited process. Females transfer lipophilic pollutants more easily to eggs, and to a higher degree with increasing maternal investment, but feeding ecology may be more important. Interspecies variation in maternal pollutant transfer may lead to negative effects scaling from an offspring to population level. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1021/acs.est.9b01296,,,

Objectives: To systematically review the epidemiologic literature on the adverse effects of early-life exposure to POPs on respiratory health, allergy and the immune system in infancy, childhood and adolescence. Methods: Based on published guidelines for systematic reviews, two independent researchers searched for published articles in MEDLINE and SCOPUS using defined keywords on POPs and respiratory health, immune function and allergy. Study eligibility criteria were defined to select the articles. Results: This review of 41 studies finds limited evidence for prenatal exposure to DDE, PCBs and dioxins and risk of respiratory infections. Evidence was limited also for postnatal exposure to PCBs, specifically ndl-PCBs, and reduced immune response after vaccination in childhood. The review indicates lack of association between postnatal exposure to PCBs/ndl-PCBs and risk of asthma-related symptoms. For the other exposure-outcome associations reviewed evidence was inadequate. Discussion and conclusion: Current epidemiological evidence suggests that early-life exposure to POPs can adversely influence immune and respiratory systems development. Heterogeneity between studies in exposure and outcome assessment and the small number of studies for any given exposure-outcome relationship currently make comparisons difficult and meta-analyses impossible. Also, mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Recommendations for significantly improving our understanding thus include harmonization of exposure and outcome assessment between studies, conduct of larger studies, long-term assessment of respiratory infections and asthma symptoms in order to identify critical periods of susceptibility, integration of the potential immunotoxic mechanisms of POPs, and use of new statistical tools to detangle the role of multiple exposures on multiple outcomes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: full text checked",10.1016/j.envint.2012.11.005,Immune System,,

The findings were subjected to evidence grading according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) classification. We found >40 cross-sectional and seven prospective studies regarding EDCs and risk of diabetes. Taken together, there is moderate evidence for a relationship between exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE), a metabolite of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, and diabetes development. Regarding polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), it is likely that the rodent models used are not appropriate, and therefore the evidence is poorer than for p,p′-DDE. For other EDCs, such as bisphenol A, phthalates and perfluorinated chemicals, the evidence is scarce, since very few prospective studies exist. Brominated flame retardants do not seem to be associated with a disturbed glucose tolerance. Thus, evidence is accumulating that EDCs might be involved in diabetes development.

These pathways include a multitude of biochemical reactions, as well as hormonal cues. Dysfunction of this homeostatic control system results in common metabolism-related pathologies, which include obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metabolism-disrupting chemicals (MDCs) are a particular class of endocrine-disrupting chemicals that affect energy homeostasis. MDCs affect multiple endocrine mechanisms and thus different cell types that are implicated in metabolic control. MDCs affect gene expression and the biosynthesis of key enzymes, hormones and adipokines that are essential for controlling energy homeostasis. This multifaceted spectrum of actions precludes compensatory responses and favours metabolic disorders. Herein, we review the main mechanisms used by MDCs to alter energy balance. This work should help to identify new MDCs, as well as novel targets of their action.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: full text checked",10.1038/nrendo.2017.51,,,

It is considered one of the main temporal windows of susceptibility for the influence of the endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). EDCs may act as single chemical agents or as chemical mixtures; they can be pubertal influencers, accelerating and anticipating the processing of maturation of secondary sexual characteristics. Moreover, recent studies have started to point out how exposure to EDCs during puberty may predispose to breast cancer later in life. In fact, the estrogen-mimicking endocrine disruptors (EEDs) may influence breast tissue development during puberty in two main ways: the first is the action on the proliferation of the breast stromal cells, the second concerns epigenetic mechanisms. The aim of this mini-review was to better highlight what is new and what is not completely known regarding the role of EDCs during puberty. © 2020 by the authors.

Maternal exposure to phthalates has been associated with shorter AGD in male offspring although not consistently, whereas too few studies on the effects of exposure to PFAS and BPA on AGD are found to draw firm conclusion. Meta-analyses suggest that adult phthalate exposure may affect semen quality, whereas the results for the effect of PFAS and BPA exposure on semen quality are contradictory. Interestingly, few studies suggest that maternal exposure to these chemicals may affect semen quality in the offspring.

Increasing epidemiological evidence suggest that EDCs may affect the development or progression of breast cancer and consequently lead to lifelong harmful health consequences, especially when exposure occurs during early life in humans. Yet so far no appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic. Objective: To systematically review all the available epidemiological studies about the association of the levels of environmental exposures of EDCs with breast cancer risk. Methods: The search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved articles from PubMed (MEDLINE) until 10 March 2021. The key words used in this research were: “Endocrine disruptor(s)” OR “Endocrine disrupting chemical(s)” OR any of the EDCs mentioned below AND “Breast cancer” to locate all relevant articles published. We included only cohort studies and case-control studies. All relevant articles were accessed in full text and were evaluated and summarized in tables. Results: We identified 131 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. EDCs reviewed herein included pesticides (e.g. p,p’-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), atrazine, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin)), synthetic chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), parabens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contraceptive pills), phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein, resveratrol), and certain mycotoxins (e.g. zearalenone). Most studies assessed environmental EDCs exposure via biomarker measurements. Conclusion: We identified certain EDC exposures could potentially elevate the risk of breast cancer. As majority of EDCs are highly persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative, it is essential to assess the long-term impacts of EDC exposures, especially multi-generational and transgenerational. Also, since food is often a major route of exposure to EDCs, well-designed exposure assessments of potential EDCs in food and food packing are necessary and their potential link to breast cancer development need to be carefully evaluated for subsequent EDC policy making and regulations. © 2021 The Author(s).

This escalating yet constant exposure is postulated to partially explain the concurrent decline in human fertility that has occurred over the last 50 years. Controversy however remains as to whether associations exist, with conflicting findings commonly reported for all major EDC classes. The primary aim of this extensive work was to identify and review strong peer-reviewed evidence regarding the effects of environmentally-relevant EDC concentrations on adult male and female fertility during the critical periconception period on reproductive hormone concentrations, gamete and embryo characteristics, as well as the time to pregnancy in the general population. Secondly, to ascertain whether individuals or couples diagnosed as sub-fertile exhibit higher EDC or toxicant concentrations. Lastly, to highlight where little or no data exists that prevents strong associations being identified. From the greater than 1480 known EDCs, substantial evidence supports a negative association between exposure to phthalates, PCBs, PBDEs, pyrethroids, organochloride pesticides and male fertility and fecundity. Only moderate evidence exists for a negative association between BPA, PCBs, organochloride pesticides and female fertility and fecundity. Overall fewer studies were reported in women than men, with knowledge gaps generally evident for both sexes for all the major EDC classes, as well as a paucity of female fertility studies following exposure to parabens, triclosans, dioxins, PFAS, organophosphates and pyrethroids. Generally, sub-fertile individuals or couples exhibit higher EDC concentrations, endorsing a positive association between EDC exposure and sub-fertility. This review also discusses confounding and limiting factors that hamper our understanding of EDC exposures on fertility and fecundity. Finally, it highlights future research areas, as well as government, industry and social awareness strategies required to mitigate the negative effects of EDC and environmental toxicant exposure on human fertility and fecundity. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.envres.2020.110694,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Self-Fertilization;Fertility,,

There is also evidence that ED exposure has trans-generational effects. In this systematic review, we evaluate the evidence for an association between EDC exposure and women's reproductive health. Methods: Studies were found by searching the PubMed database for articles published up to 2010. Associations between ED exposure and women's reproductive health reported in the PubMed database are summarized and classified as fertility and fecundity, pregnancy outcomes, transgenerational exposure and effects. Results: Epidemiological studies on EDCs are not always consistent, in part due to limitations imposed by practical constraints. In order to make progress in this field, we recommend taking advantage of biomonitoring and biobanks, including the development of appropriate biomarkers, and taking into greater consideration modulating factors such as genetic polymorphisms and dietary habits. Further human studies are warranted with particular focus on impaired fertility/fecundity associated with currently widespread ED (e.g. bisphenol A, phthalates and polybrominated flame retardants). Conclusions: A detailed appraisal of compounds specifically related to adverse reproductive outcomes is very important for prevention and risk-communication strategies.

The main causes of the decline are social factors. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that many environmental chemicals show endocrine disrupting properties. Thus, we hypothesized that exposure to these chemicals would also be a causal for the fertility crisis. In this review, we examined current evidence that focused on environmental chemical exposure in utero and its association with reproductive hormones in children. We have included the findings from a prospective birth cohorts, the Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health Sapporo cohort. According to the literature, environmental chemical levels in utero, such as polychlorinated biphenyl, dioxins, perfluorinated chemical substances, phthalates, and bisphenol A were somewhat associated with the levels of reproductive hormones, such as testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, inhibin B, and insulin-like factor-3 in cord blood, in early childhood and adolescence. The literature also suggests the association between exposure to these chemicals and brain-sexual differentiation or the anogenital distance, which suggests the disruption of androgen shower during the developmental stage in the fetal period. There are still knowledge gaps on whether these hormones at an early stage affect the pubertal development and reproductive functions in later life. In addition, alternative chemicals are produced after banning one type. The health effects of alternative chemicals should be evaluated. Effects of exposure to a mixture of the chemicals should also be examined in future studies.

Breast cancer's long latency and multifactorial etiology make evaluation of these chemicals in humans challenging. Objective For chemicals previously identified as mammary gland toxicants, we evaluated epidemiologic studies published since our 2007 review. We assessed whether study designs captured relevant exposures and disease features suggested by toxicological and biological evidence of genotoxicity, endocrine disruption, tumor promotion, or disruption of mammary gland development. Methods We systematically searched the PubMed database for articles with breast cancer outcomes published in 2006–2016 using terms for 134 environmental chemicals, sources, or biomarkers of exposure. We critically reviewed the articles. Results We identified 158 articles. Consistent with experimental evidence, a few key studies suggested higher risk for exposures during breast development to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dioxins, perfluorooctane-sulfonamide (PFOSA), and air pollution (risk estimates ranged from 2.14 to 5.0), and for occupational exposure to solvents and other mammary carcinogens, such as gasoline components (risk estimates ranged from 1.42 to 3.31). Notably, one 50-year cohort study captured exposure to DDT during several critical windows for breast development (in utero, adolescence, pregnancy) and when this chemical was still in use. Most other studies did not assess exposure during a biologically relevant window or specify the timing of exposure. Few studies considered genetic variation, but the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project reported higher breast cancer risk for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in women with certain genetic variations, especially in DNA repair genes. Conclusions New studies that targeted toxicologically relevant chemicals and captured biological hypotheses about genetic variants or windows of breast susceptibility added to evidence of links between environmental chemicals and breast cancer. However, many biologically relevant chemicals, including current-use consumer product chemicals, have not been adequately studied in humans.

RECENT FINDINGS: Studies in recent years have revealed thyroid-disrupting properties of many environmentally abundant chemicals. Of special concern is the exposure of pregnant women and infants, as thyroid disruption of the developing fetus may have deleterious effects on neurological outcome. Evidence is reviewed for the following groups of chemicals: polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, flame retardants, pesticides, perfluorinated chemicals, phthalates, bisphenol A and ultraviolet filters. Chemicals may exert thyroid effects through a variety of mechanisms of action, and some publications have focused on elucidating the mechanisms of specific (groups of) chemicals. SUMMARY: A large variety of ubiquitous chemicals have been shown to have thyroid-disrupting properties, and the combination of mechanistic, epidemiological and exposure studies indicates that the ubiquitous human and environmental exposure to industrial chemicals may impose a serious threat to human and wildlife thyroid homeostasis. Currently, available evidence suggests that authorities need to regulate exposure to thyroid-disrupting chemicals of pregnant women, neonates and small children in order to avoid potential impairment of brain development.

Mortality is associated mainly with the development of metastases. Identification of the mechanisms involved in metastasis formation is, therefore, a major public health issue. Among the proposed risk factors, chemical environment and pollution are increasingly suggested to have an effect on the signaling pathways involved in metastatic tumor cells emergence and progression. The purpose of this article is to summarize current knowledge about the role of environmental chemicals in breast cancer progression, metastasis formation and resistance to chemotherapy. Through a scoping review, we highlight the effects of a wide variety of environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants and endocrine disruptors, on invasion mechanisms and metastatic processes in BC. We identified the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer-stemness (the stem cell-like phenotype in tumors), two mechanisms suspected of playing key roles in the development of metastases and linked to chemoresistance, as potential targets of contaminants. We discuss then the recently described pro-migratory and pro-invasive Ah receptor signaling pathway and conclude that his role in BC progression is still controversial. In conclusion, although several pertinent pathways for the effects of xenobiotics have been identified, the mechanisms of actions for multiple other molecules remain to be established. The integral role of xenobiotics in the exposome in BC needs to be further explored through additional relevant epidemiological studies that can be extended to molecular mechanisms. © 2020, The Author(s).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: full text checked",10.1186/s12940-020-00670-2,Breast Neoplasms;Drug Resistance,,

Studies were included in our review if they included at least 10 cases, evaluated preeclampsia independent of gestational hypertension, and used either measured or modeled exposure assessments. Our review contained 28 investigations examining persistent organic pollutants (POP) (6 studies), drinking water contaminants (1 study), atmospheric pollutants (11 studies), metals and metalloids (6 studies), and other environmental contaminants (4 studies). There were an insufficient number of investigations on most chemicals to draw definitive conclusions, but strong evidence existed for an association between preeclampsia and cadmium (Cd). There is suggestive evidence for associations between nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM)(2.5), and traffic exposure with preeclampsia. There is evidence for an association between preeclampsia and Cd but insufficient literature to evaluate many other environmental chemicals. Additional studies using repeated measures, appropriate biological matrices, and mixtures methods are needed to expand this area of research and address the limitations of previous studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: full text checked",10.1080/10937404.2018.1554515,Pre-Eclampsia,,
rayyan-421822260,Environmental pollutants and child health-A review of recent concerns,2016,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"In recent years, many new studies have evaluated associations between environmental pollutants and child health. This review aims to provide a broad summary of this literature, comparing the state of epidemiological evidence for the effects of a wide range of environmental contaminants (air pollutants, heavy metals, organochlorine compounds, perfluoroalkyl substances, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, pesticides, phthalates and bisphenol A) on child health outcomes. The review addresses effects on foetal growth and prematurity, neurodevelopment, respiratory and immune health, and childhood growth and obesity. Findings of recent prospective studies and meta-analyses have corroborated previous good evidence, often at lower exposure levels, for effects on foetal growth of air pollution and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), for neurotoxic effects of lead, methylmercury, PCBs and organophosphate pesticides, and for respiratory health effects of air pollution. Moderate evidence has emerged for a potential role of environmental pollutants in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism (lead, PCBs, air pollution), respiratory and immune health (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene - DDE - and PCBs), and obesity (DDE). In addition, there is now moderate evidence that certain chemicals of relatively recent concern may be associated with adverse child health outcomes, specifically perfluorooctanoate and foetal growth, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers and neurodevelopment. For other chemicals of recent concern, such as phthalates and bisphenol A, the literature is characterised by large inconsistencies preventing strong conclusions. In conclusion, since most of the recent literature evaluates common exposures in the general population, and not particularly high exposure situations, this accumulating body of evidence suggests that the unborn and young child require more protection than is currently provided. Large, coordinated research efforts are needed to improve understanding of long-term effects of complex chemical mixtures. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.ijheh.2016.05.001,Child Welfare;Only Child;Child,,

Astrocytes, the most numerous cell type, are increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases of the central nervous system, including neurodegenerative diseases. Astrocytes are critical for proper brain function in part due to their robust antioxidant and unique metabolic capabilities. Additionally, astrocytes are positioned both at the blood-brain barrier, where they are the primary responders to xenobiotic penetrance of the CNS, and at synapses where they are in close contact with neurons and synaptic machinery. While exposure to several classes of environmental toxicants, including chlorinated and fluorinated compounds, and trace metals, have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, their impact on astrocytes represents an important and growing field of research. Here, we review existing literature focused on the impact of a range of synthetic compounds on astrocytic function.

Understanding the role of environmental chemicals in the development or progression of diabetes is an emerging issue in environmental health. Objective: We assessed the epidemiologic literature for evidence of associations between persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and type 2 diabetes. Methods: Using a PubMed search and reference lists from relevant studies or review articles, we identified 72 epidemiological studies that investigated associations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) with diabetes. We evaluated these studies for consistency, strengths and weaknesses of study design (including power and statistical methods), clinical diagnosis, exposure assessment, study population characteristics, and identification of data gaps and areas for future research. Conclusions: Heterogeneity of the studies precluded conducting a meta-analysis, but the overall evidence is sufficient for a positive association of some organochlorine POPs with type 2 diabetes. Collectively, these data are not sufficient to establish causality. Initial data mining revealed that the strongest positive correlation of diabetes with POPs occurred with organochlorine compounds, such as trans-nonachlor, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dioxins and dioxin-like chemicals. There is less indication of an association between other nonorganochlorine POPs, such as perfluoroalkyl acids and brominated compounds, and type 2 diabetes. Experimental data are needed to confirm the causality of these POPs, which will shed new light on the pathogenesis of diabetes. This new information should be considered by governmental bodies involved in the regulation of environmental contaminants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1289/ehp.1205502,,,

This review aims to evaluate the impact of environmental exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals [phthalates, parabens, triclosan, bisphenol A (BPA), organochlorine (PCBs) and perfluorinated (PFCs) compounds] on the reproductive potential among women, by reviewing most recently published literature. Epidemiological studies focusing on EDCs exposure and reproductive potential among women for the last 16 years were identified by a search of the PUBMED, MEDLINE, EBSCO and TOXNET literature databases. The results of the presented studies show that exposure to EDCs impacts the reproductive potential in women, measured by ovarian reserve and by assisted reproductive technology outcomes. Exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals decrease: (i) oestradiol levels (BPA); (ii) anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations (PCBs); (iii) antral follicle count (BPA, parabens, phthalates); (iv) oocyte quality (BPA, triclosan, phthalates, PCBs); (v) fertilization rate (PFCs, PCBs); (vi) implantation (BPA, phthalates, PCBs); (vii) embryo quality (triclosan, PCBs, BPA); (viii) rate of clinical pregnancy and live births (parabens, phthalates).

Although exposure to PFASs may contribute to the development of allergic diseases in children, evidence about this association remains inconclusive. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between PFASs exposure and allergic diseases in children based on current evidence. Methods: The databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched to identify all observational studies that examined the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of childhood allergic diseases. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of case-crossover studies, and a previously validated quality assessment framework was used for observational studies lacking control groups. Random-effects meta-analysis models were applied to pool odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: From an initial 94 articles (after duplicate removal), 13 studies through full-text assessment were included for quantitative assessment and descriptive synthesis. They are ten cohort studies, two cross-sectional studies, and one case-control study. The pooled estimates showed that perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was associated with eczema (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.80–0.99), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) with atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.01–1.58), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) with allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.13–1.56). However, no such significant associations were found for wheeze and asthma. Conclusions: The meta-analysis results suggest that PFASs exposure could potentially be associated with eczema, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis during childhood, but not with childhood asthma or wheeze.

rayyan-421822266,Fate and effects of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the aquatic environment: A review,2014,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are distributed ubiquitously in the aquatic environment, which raises concern for the flora and fauna in hydrosystems. The present critical review focuses on the fate and adverse effects of PFASs in the aquatic environment. The PFASs are continuously emitted into the environment from point and nonpoint sources such as sewage treatment plants and atmospheric deposition, respectively. Although concentrations of single substances may be too low to cause adverse effects, their mixtures can be of significant environmental concern. The production of C8-based PFASs (i.e., perfluorooctane sulfonate [PFOS] and perfluorooctanoate [PFOA]) is largely phased out; however, the emissions of other PFASs, in particular short-chain PFASs and PFAS precursors, are increasing. The PFAS precursors can finally degrade to persistent degradation products, which are, in particular, perfluoroalkane sulfonates (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs). In the environment, PFSAs and PFCAs are subject to partitioning processes, whereby short-chain PFSAs and PFCAs are mainly distributed in the water phase, whereas long-chain PFSAs and PFCAs tend to bind to particles and have a substantial bioaccumulation potential. However, there are fundamental knowledge gaps about the interactive toxicity of PFAS precursors and their persistent degradation products but also interactions with other natural and anthropogenic stressors. Moreover, because of the continuous emission of PFASs, further information about their ecotoxicological potential among multiple generations, species interactions, and mixture toxicity seems fundamental to reliably assess the risks for PFASs to affect ecosystem structure and function in the aquatic environment. © 2014 SETAC.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1002/etc.2663,"RNA, Messenger;Polyglactin 910;Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins;Poly I-C;Poly A-U;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Polymethyl Methacrylate",,
rayyan-421822267,Human exposure pathways to poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from indoor media: A systematic review,2022,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"Background: Human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been primarily attributed to contaminated food and drinking water. There is information indicating other sources and pathways of exposure in residential environments, but few studies report relationships between these indoor media and human biomonitoring measurements. Methods: This study adapts existing systematic review tools and methodologies to synthesize evidence for PFAS exposure pathways from indoor environment media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust. Studies were identified using innovative machine learning approaches and pathway-specific search strings to reduce time needed for literature search and screening. The included studies and systematic review were evaluated using tools modified specifically for exposure studies. The systematic review was conducted following a previously published protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) that describes the systematic review methodology used in detail. Results: Only 7 studies were identified that measured the targeted subset of 8 PFAS chemicals in concordant household media (primarily house dust) and participant serum. Data extracted from the included studies were used to calculate exposure intake rates and estimate a percentage of occupant serum concentrations that could be attributed to the indoor exposure pathways. These calculations showed that exposure to PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS from contaminated house dust could account for 13%, 3%, 7%, and 25% of serum concentrations, respectively. Inhalation of PFAS in indoor air could account for less than 4% of serum PFOA concentrations and less than 2% of serum PFOS and PFNA concentrations. A risk of bias was identified due to participant profiles in most of the studies being skewed towards white, female, and higher socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Along with synthesizing evidence for estimated contributions to serum PFAS levels from indoor exposure media, this systematic review also identifies a consistent risk of bias across exposure study populations that should be considered in future studies. It highlights a major research gap and need for studies that measure concordant data from both indoor exposure media and participant serum and the need for continued research on exposure modeling parameters for many PFAS chemicals. © 2022","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.envint.2022.107149,"Humanities;Humanism;Humans;RNA, Messenger;Polyglactin 910;Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins;Poly I-C;Poly A-U;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Polymethyl Methacrylate",,

rayyan-421822269,Impact of Contaminants on Microbiota: Linking the Gut–Brain Axis with Neurotoxicity,2022,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"Over the last years, research has focused on microbiota to establish a missing link between neuronal health and intestine imbalance. Many studies have considered microbiota as critical regulators of the gut–brain axis. The crosstalk between microbiota and the central nervous system is mainly explained through three different pathways: the neural, endocrine, and immune pathways, intricately interconnected with each other. In day-to-day life, human beings are exposed to a wide variety of contaminants that affect our intestinal microbiota and alter the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, causing neuronal disorders. The interplay between xenobiotics, microbiota and neurotoxicity is still not fully explored, especially for susceptible populations such as pregnant women, neonates, and developing children. Precisely, early exposure to contaminants can trigger neurodevelopmental toxicity and long-term diseases. There is growing but limited research on the specific mechanisms of the microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA), making it challenging to understand the effect of environmental pollutants. In this review, we discuss the biological interplay between microbiota–gut–brain and analyse the role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals: Bisphenol A (BPA), Chlorpyrifos (CPF), Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in MGBA perturbations and subsequent neurotoxicity. The complexity of the MGBA and the changing nature of the gut microbiota pose significant challenges for future research. However, emerging in-silico models able to analyse and interpret meta-omics data are a promising option for understanding the processes in this axis and can help prevent neurotoxicity. © 2022 by the authors.

rayyan-421822270,Impact of perfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS) exposure on maternal and newborn health in Veneto region,2018,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"Background. Perfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS) are persistent organic pollutants that accumulate in the fish, wildlife, and humans. In 2013, it has been discovered an area of the Veneto Region in which ground water, surface water, and drinking water were contaminated by PFAS. Appropriate interventions have been undertaken to contain the water pollution, reducing it effectively. However, it has been estimated that the contamination had started about fifty years before its discovery, leading to the long-term exposure of the population. The long-term exposure to PFAS is worrying because PFAS have been suggested to affect human health. Veneto Region has therefore organized a health surveillance programme of the population living in the polluted area. A specific aspect of such programme concerns the maternal and newborn health, which represents the focus of my PhD research project. The aims of the project were to review animal and human evidence related to this topic and to assess the effects of the exposure to PFAS on maternal and newborn health in the population living in the polluted area of Veneto Region. Methods. The systematic review included relevant studies in the English language identified through the online database PubMed. Studies were eligible to the review if they assess the effect of PFAS exposure during the reproductive period on the health of the pregnant women and of the infant. The identification of the outcomes of interest assessed in the study about maternal and newborn health in Veneto Region was based on the systematic review. The outcomes investigated were preeclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (pregnancy complications), and intrauterine growth restriction, evaluated using a proxy of fetal growth, the Small for Gestational Age (SGA) (birth outcomes). The study was performed using an indirect measure of exposure to PFAS, defined as woman’s residence in the contaminated area (including 21 municipalities identified according to a Veneto Region Official Resolution). A control area that included 48 municipalities not exposed to PFAS contamination according to the performance limits of the National Institue of Health was chosen for comparision. The information sources included two administrative datasets, the Veneto Region Birth Registry and the Veneto Region hospital discharge records. For the pregnancy complications (preeclampsia and GDM), a medical chart review of pregnant women hospitalized is ongoing to validate the cases identified from the hospital discharge records. Results. The systematic review led to the retrieval of 1096 records from PubMed. One hundred and thirty-nine records were judged to be eligible to the study. Overall, evidence retrieved suggests that PFAS exposure might affect the health of the pregnant woman and the development of the fetus. The epidemiological study showed that newborns of mothers living in the contaminated area were significantly more likely to be SGA compared to newborns of mothers living in the control area (adjusted Odds Ratio 1.26, 95% C.I. 1.14-1.38). Looking at pregnancy complications (preeclampsia and GDM), preliminary results were available because the review of the medical chart is ongoing. Such preliminary results seem to suggest that the frequency of these pathological conditions is slightly higher in women living in the contaminated area compared to those living in the control ones. However, they must be taken with caution because the validation of preeclampsia and GDM cases is ongoing. Conclusions. The results of the present research project suggest that PFAS exposure might affect maternal and newborn health. The present topic deserves further research, not only from the epidemiological point of view, but also for what concerns the pathophysiological mechanisms potentially involved in the association between PFAS exposure and adverse health outcomes in pregnant women and newborns.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",NA,"Maternal Exposure;Infant, Newborn",,

A systematic review of epidemiological studies,2020,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"Anti-androgenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can cross the placenta to modify early offspring sexual dimorphic markers. These changes are linked to anogenital distance (AGD), which is an androgen-sensitive anthropometric parameter used as a biomarker of perineal growth and caudal migration of the genital tubercle. This review aimed to summarize strength of evidence for associations of in utero exposure to EDCs with AGD and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature so as to inform future research. We performed an electronic search of English literature in September 2019 in medical literature analysis and retrieval system online (MEDLINE), Web of Science and Toxline. We included epidemiological studies that examined in utero exposure to persistent and nonpersistent EDCs and considered AGD in offspring as an outcome. Our review contained 16 investigations examining exposure to persistent EDCs (nine studies) and nonpersistent EDCs (seven studies). Some individual studies reported an inverse association between exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), dioxins, perfluoroalkyl substances, and organochlorides and AGD in both male and female offspring. Meta-analysis of three studies found a small reduction of AGD in female offspring exposed to BPA. The number of studies per chemical is small, and number of subjects examined is limited; so, replication of these results is needed. To achieve more specificity and better replication of results, future studies should establish the association of nonpersistent EDCs using multiple urine samples, evaluate the cumulative impact of exposure to a mixture of anti-androgenic chemicals, and offer adequate consideration of more maternal- and children-related confounding factors. © 2019 The Author(s).

Following rapid weight loss such as when induced by bariatric surgery, an increased release of potential harmful lipophilic compounds into the blood circulation may occur. Weight reduction is recommended for overweight and obese individuals in order to decrease risk of weight-related health problems. However, in cases of significant weight reduction POP become mobilized chemicals and consequently may adversely affect health, including endocrine disruption. The objective of the present investigation was to estimate quantitatively the level of mobilization of POP following weight loss over time. According to literature search criteria, 17 studies were identified with 2061 participants. Data from 5 of the studies with 270 participants were used to assess the change in blood levels of POP in percent per kilogram weight loss. Weight loss in the included studies varied from 4.4 to 64.8 kg. In all studies, the majority of POP concentrations in blood were found to rise following weight reduction. Blood concentrations following weight reduction were elevated by 2–4% per kilogram weight loss for most POP examined. The increased POP levels were still elevated 12 mo after intervention. Most research in this field, including animal studies, is carried out on a single compound or group of selected compounds, not taking the “cocktail effect” into consideration. This does not reflect the true range of POP to which humans are actually exposed. Few chronic investigations have been published and, in particular, few studies were available that compared the increase in POP concentrations with clinical consequences as individuals lost weight. These limitations call for caution in interpreting results. The benefits of losing weight still far outweigh the potential adverse health risks. However, further studies are recommended to determine the clinical significance of increased blood levels of POPs following rapid and excessive weight loss, particularly for women attending weight reduction treatment before pregnancy. © 2016, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © Aina Jansen, Jan L.

This model has been widely used by investigators to study the biology of the TJ and the BTB. Studies have shown that environmental toxicants (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), bisphenol A (BPA) and cadmium) that exert their disruptive effects to induce Sertoli cell injury using this in vitro model are reproducible in studies in vivo. Thus, this in vitro system provides a convenient approach to probe the molecular mechanism(s) underlying toxicant-induced testis injury but also to provide new insights in understanding spermatogenesis, such as the biology of cell adhesion, BTB restructuring that supports preleptotene spermatocyte transport, and others. Herein, we provide a brief and critical review based on studies using this in vitro model of Sertoli cell cultures using primary cells isolated from rodent testes vs. humans to monitor environmental toxicant-mediated Sertoli cell injury. In short, recent findings have shown that environmental toxicants exert their effects on Sertoli cells to induce testis injury through their action on Sertoli cell actin- and/or microtubule-based cytoskeleton. These effects are mediated via their disruptive effects on actin- and/or microtubule-binding proteins. Sertoli cells also utilize differential spatiotemporal expression of these actin binding proteins to confer plasticity to the BTB to regulate germ cell transport across the BTB. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.semcdb.2016.01.003,Spermatogenesis,,

Humans are constantly exposed to ECs, primarily through environmental components. This review compiled human epidemiological study findings of associations between blood and/or urinary exposure levels of ECs and anthropometric overweight and obesity indices. The findings reveal research gaps that should be addressed. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed) for full text English articles published in 2006-2020 using the keywords ""environmental exposure"" and ""obesity"". A total of 821 articles were retrieved; 102 reported relationships between environmental exposure and obesity indices. ECs were the predominantly studied environmental exposure compounds. The ECs were grouped into phenols, phthalates, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to evaluate obesogenic roles. In total, 106 articles meeting the inclusion criteria were summarized after an additional search by each group of EC combined with obesity in the PubMed and Scopus databases. Dose-dependent positive associations between bisphenol A (BPA) and various obesity indices were revealed. Both individual and summed di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and non-DEHP metabolites showed inconsistent associations with overweight and obesity indices, although mono-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), and mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) seem to have obesogenic roles in adolescents, adults, and the elderly. Maternal exposure levels of individual POP metabolites or congeners showed inconsistent associations, whereas dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were positively associated with obesity indices. There was insufficient evidence of associations between early childhood EC exposure and the subsequent development of overweight and obesity in late childhood. Overall, human evidence explicitly reveals the consistent obesogenic roles of BPA, DDE, and PFOA, but inconsistent roles of phthalate metabolites and other POPs.

This review aims to identify epidemiological studies focusing on the association between MetS or its individual components (e.g., obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension) and eight HBM4EU priority substances (bisphenol A (BPA), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides and heavy metals (cadmium, arsenic and mercury)). Thus far, human biomonitoring (HBM) studies have presented evidence supporting the role of EDC exposures on the development of individual MetS components. The strength of the association varies between the components and EDCs. Current evidence on metabolic disturbances and EDCs is still limited and heterogeneous, and mainly represent studies from North America and Asia, highlighting the need for well-conducted and harmonized HBM programmes among the European population. Rigorous and ongoing HBM in combination with health monitoring can help to identify the most concerning EDC exposures, to guide future risk assessment and policy actions. © 2021 by the authors.

In this comprehensive worldwide review, we collected ecotoxicology and concentration data observed in surface water for 53 high-potency EDs and performed a risk assessment. The compounds were selected from the EU watchlist of priority substances, expanded with new compounds of emerging concern (total 41), where quantifiable data were available for the past three years (2018–2020). The risk quotients ranged from <0.01 for 22 substances to 1974 for tamoxifen. The frequency of samples in which the predicted no-effect concentrations were exceeded also varied, from 1.8% to 92.7%. By using the comprehensive multi-parameter risk assessment in our study, the most current to date, we determined that tamoxifen, imidacloprid, clothianidin, four bisphenols (BPA, BPF, BPS, and BPAF), PFOA, amoxicillin, and three steroid hormones (estriol, estrone, and cyproterone) pose significant risks in the environment. Comparing two structurally very similar bisphenols, BPA and BPB, suggested that the risk from BPB is currently underestimated by at least four orders of magnitude due to the lack of ecotoxicological data availability. The methodological limitations encountered suggest that a standardized methodology for data selection and assessment is necessary, highlighting the fact that some substances are currently under-represented in the field of ecotoxicological research.

Over the last decade there have been increasing reports in the epidemiological literature of the potential association of exposure to polybromo diphenylethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) with neurodevelopmental and/or neurobehavioural effects in infants and children, such as adverse birth outcomes, cognitive deficits, developmental delay and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). However, direct evidence from epidemiology studies has been limited and contradictory. Given the general lack of comparability across studies in terms of design, conduct, methodology and reporting, we developed a checklist-type quality assessment scheme based on the STROBE guidelines and the proposed HONEES criteria, and conducted a systematic review of the epidemiological peer-reviewed literature published since 2006 on neurodevelopmental and/or neurobehavioural effects following prenatal and postnatal exposure to PBDEs and PFCs. We rated 7 of the 18 studies that met our inclusion criteria as being of high quality, 7 of moderate quality and 4 of low quality. Frequently observed shortcomings were the lack of consideration of confounding factors; uncertainties regarding exposure characterization; inadequate sample size; the lack of a clear dose-response; and the representativeness/generalizability of the results. Collectively, the epidemiological evidence does currently not support a strong causal association between PBDEs and PFCs and adverse neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioural outcomes in infants and children.

This review summarizes the underlying evidence on the primary fate and in vitro/vivo toxic effects of PFCs and their interactions and relationships with thyroid dysfunction and cancer induction in exposed groups, including the general population, occupationally exposed groups, highly exposed individuals, and prone subjects (pregnant women and neonates). The potential endocrine-disrupting mechanism of PFCs may include multiple processes of thyroid malfunction or hormonal imbalance. The increased level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was observed as the most consistent outcome of PFC exposure among generally exposed populations. Specifically, the levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and TSH were significantly correlated among pregnant women. In some instances, the maternal PFC level was negatively correlated with the neonatal thyroxine (T4) level in serum. The PFCs and thyroid malfunction or thyroid hormone (TH) levels also revealed a potential association among the population under high-level environmental exposure, albeit not always following a strict exposure-response relationship. Moreover, occupational exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) showed a probable link with TH (excluding TSH) alterations in serum. Importantly, no concrete and statistically significant evidence highlighted the risk of thyroid cancer in humans exposed to PFCs. Highlights The first robust review describing the effects of PFCs on thyroid dysfunctions. PFC exposure induces sex- and age-specific responses in the human thyroid system.

Several associations have been studied between chemical exposure in utero and postnatally. Current opinion among researchers indicates that the obesogen theory is very likely; however, limited published studies show inconsistent support for the obesogenic effects of most substances in children and are limited by difficulty in providing the exact mechanisms of action, nor is their mutual effect in humans known, let alone in children.

It also receives organic pollutants from anthropogenic sources, which threatens the ecological function of the deep sea. In this Review, critically examined data on the distribution of organic pollutants in the deep sea to outline the role of biogeochemical and geophysical factors on the global distribution and regional chemodynamics of organic pollutants in the deep sea. We found that the contribution of deep water formation to the influx of perfluorinated compounds reached a maximum, following peak emission, faster in young deep waters (&lt; 10 years) compared to older deep waters (&gt; 100 years). For example, perfluorinated compounds had low concentrations (&lt; 10 pg L−1) and vertical variations in the South Pacific Ocean where the ocean currents are old (&lt; 1000 years). Steep geomorphologies of submarine canyons, ridges, and valleys facilitated the transport of sediments and associated organic pollutants by oceanic currents from the continental shelf to remote deep seas. In addition, we found that, even though an estimated 1.2–4.2 million metric tons of plastic debris enter the ocean through riverine discharge annually, the role of microplastics as vectors of organic pollutants (e.g., plastic monomers, additives, and attached organic pollutants) in the deep sea is often overlooked.

Integrated crop–livestock systems combine agricultural crop production with milk and/or meat production and processing. Key sources of PFAS in these systems include firefighting foams near military bases, wastewater sludge and industrial discharge. Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances regularly move from soils to nearby surface water and/or groundwater because of their high mobility and persistence. Irrigating crops or managing livestock for milk and meat production using adjacent waters can be detrimental to human health. The presence of PFAS in both groundwater and milk have been reported in dairy production states (e.g., Wisconsin and New Mexico) across the United States.

Despite increasing awareness as global pollutants, the impact of PFAS exposure on human health is not well understood, and there are growing concerns for adverse effects on kidney function. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review to summarize and identify gaps in the understanding between PFAS exposure and kidney health. Design, setting, participants, & measurements We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO Global Health, World Health Organization Global Index, and Web of Science for studies published from 1990 to 2018. We included studies on the epidemiology, pharmacokinetics, or toxicology of PFAS exposure and kidney-related health, including clinical, histologic, molecular, and metabolic outcomes related to kidney disease, or outcomes related to the pharmacokinetic role of the kidneys. Results We identified 74 studies, including 21 epidemiologic, 13 pharmacokinetic, and 40 toxicological studies. Three population-based epidemiologic studies demonstrated associations between PFAS exposure and lower kidney function. Along with toxicology studies (n=10) showing tubular histologic and cellular changes from PFAS exposure, pharmacokinetic studies (n=5) demonstrated the kidneys were major routes of elimination, with active proximal tubule transport. In several studies (n=17), PFAS exposure altered several pathways linked to kidney disease, including oxidative stress pathways, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor pathways, NF-E2– related factor 2 pathways, partial epithelial mesenchymal transition, and enhanced endothelial permeability through actin filament modeling.

rayyan-421822287,Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and their effects on the ovary,2020,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"BACKGROUND: Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are found widespread in drinking water, foods, food packaging materials and other consumer products. Several PFAS have been identified as endocrine-disrupting chemicals based on their ability to interfere with normal reproductive function and hormonal signalling. Experimental models and epidemiologic studies suggest that PFAS exposures target the ovary and represent major risks for women's health. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: This review summarises human population and toxicological studies on the association between PFAS exposure and ovarian function. SEARCH METHODS: A comprehensive review was performed by searching PubMed. Search terms included an extensive list of PFAS and health terms ranging from general keywords (e.g. ovarian, reproductive, follicle, oocyte) to specific keywords (including menarche, menstrual cycle, menopause, primary ovarian insufficiency/premature ovarian failure, steroid hormones), based on the authors' knowledge of the topic and key terms. OUTCOMES: Clinical evidence demonstrates the presence of PFAS in follicular fluid and their ability to pass through the blood-follicle barrier. Although some studies found no evidence associating PFAS exposure with disruption in ovarian function, numerous epidemiologic studies, mostly with cross-sectional study designs, have identified associations of higher PFAS exposure with later menarche, irregular menstrual cycles, longer cycle length, earlier age of menopause and reduced levels of oestrogens and androgens. Adverse effects of PFAS on ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis have been confirmed in experimental models. Based on laboratory research findings, PFAS could diminish ovarian reserve and reduce endogenous hormone synthesis through activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, disrupting gap junction intercellular communication between oocyte and granulosa cells, inducing thyroid hormone deficiency, antagonising ovarian enzyme activities involved in ovarian steroidogenesis or inhibiting kisspeptin signalling in the hypothalamus. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The published literature supports associations between PFAS exposure and adverse reproductive outcomes; however, the evidence remains insufficient to infer a causal relationship between PFAS exposure and ovarian disorders. Thus, more research is warranted. PFAS are of significant concern because these chemicals are ubiquitous and persistent in the environment and in humans. Moreover, susceptible groups, such as foetuses and pregnant women, may be exposed to harmful combinations of chemicals that include PFAS. However, the role environmental exposures play in reproductive disorders has received little attention by the medical community. To better understand the potential risk of PFAS on human ovarian function, additional experimental studies using PFAS doses equivalent to the exposure levels found in the general human population and mixtures of compounds are required. Prospective investigations in human populations are also warranted to ensure the temporality of PFAS exposure and health endpoints and to minimise the possibility of reverse causality. © The Author(s) 2020.

The transition to short-chain fluorotelomer-based products as a cornerstone in replacement fluorochemistry has raised questions regarding potential human health risks associated with exposure to fluorotelomer-based substances and therefore, PFHxA. Here, we present a critical review of data relevant to such a risk assessment, including epidemiological studies and in vivo and in vitro toxicity studies that examined PFHxA acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicity. Key findings from toxicokinetic and mode-of-action studies are also evaluated. Sufficient data exist to conclude that PFHxA is not carcinogenic, is not a selective reproductive or developmental toxicant, and does not disrupt endocrine activity. Collectively, effects caused by PFHxA exposure are largely limited to potential kidney effects, are mild and/or reversible, and occur at much higher doses than observed for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). A chronic human-health-based oral reference dose (RfD) for PFHxA of 0.25 mg/kg-day was calculated using benchmark dose modeling of renal papillary necrosis from a chronic rat bioassay. This RfD is four orders of magnitude greater than the chronic oral RfD calculated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for PFOA. The PFHxA RfD can be used to inform public health decisions related to PFHxA and fluorotelomer precursors for which PFHxA is a terminal degradant. These findings clearly demonstrate that PFHxA is less hazardous to human health than PFOA.

With the shift towards short-chain PFAA chemistry, uncertainties remain regarding human health risks associated with current exposure levels. Here, we present a critical review and assessment of data relevant to human health risk assessment to today's short-chain PFAA chemistry. Human biomonitoring surveys indicate that PFHxA is infrequently detected in the environment as well as in human serum and urine; however, human health concerns may persist in locations where PFHxA is detected. In a companion paper (Luz et al., 2019) we comprehensively evaluate the available toxicity data for PFHxA, and derive a chronic human health-based reference dose (RfD) for PFHxA of 0.25 mg/kg-day based on benchmark dose modeling of renal papillary necrosis in chronically exposed female rats. In this paper, we apply this RfD in human health-based screening levels calculations, and derive a drinking water lifetime health advisory of 1400 μg/L and a residential groundwater screening level for children of 4000 μg/L. Compared to environmental concentration data, even sites with more elevated concentrations of PFHxA in the environment are at least an order of magnitude lower than these screening levels. Available PFHxA human serum and urine biomonitoring data, used as a biomarker for general population exposure, demonstrates that the general human population exposures to PFHxA are low. Previous estimates of daily intake rates for infants exposed to PFHxA through breast milk, formula, and baby foods (Lorenzo et al., 2016) combined with the most conservative PFHxA peer-reviewed toxicity value (Luz et al., 2019) demonstrate that the margin of safety for PFHxA is high. Therefore, PFHxA and related fluorotelomer precursors currently appear to present negligible human health risk to the general population and are not likely to drive or substantially contribute to risk at sites contaminated with PFAS mixtures. PFHxA may also represent a suitable marker for the safety of fluorotelomer replacement chemistry used today. © 2019","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.yrtph.2019.01.020,Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

The PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify studies that examined the impact of PFOA exposure in early life on childhood adiposity. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to pool the statistical estimates. We identified ten prospective cohort studies comprising 6076 participants with PFOA exposure.

Sex-specific differences in the development of NAFLD are apparent. While obesity and insulin resistance are major contributors to the increasing prevalence of NAFLD, a growing body of literature suggests that exposure to persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals (pEDCs) may also play a role. This review summarizes recent (2011 and later) scientific literature investigating exposures to pEDCs, specifically persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and NAFLD, with a focus on sex-specific associations. RECENT FINDINGS: The overwhelming majority of studies were conducted in single-sex animal models and provide biological evidence that exposures to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin polychlorinated biphenyls, and other POPs or POP mixtures are negatively associated with liver health. There were four cross-sectional epidemiological studies in humans that reported associations for several POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls and perfluorinated chemicals, with elevated liver enzymes. Only one of these studies, using a sample of gastric bypass surgery patients, examined sex-specific associations of POPs and liver enzymes, finding adverse associations among women only. The noticeable lack of studies investigating how differences (i.e., biochemical, physiological, and behavioral) between men and women may influence associations of pEDCs and NAFLD represents a large research gap in environmental health. Sexual dimorphism in metabolic processes throughout the body, including the liver, is established but often overlooked in the designs and analyses of studies. Other factors identified in this review that may also act to modulate associations of environmental chemicals and NAFLD are reproductive status and dietary nutrient intakes, which also remain understudied in the literature. Despite knowledge of sexual dimorphism in the actions of pEDCs, as well as in metabolic processes related to NAFLD development, few experimental or epidemiological studies have investigated sex-dependent associations. Future studies, especially those in humans, should be designed to address this research need. Consideration of other factors, such as reproductive status, dietary intakes, and mixtures of chemicals with varying endocrine-disrupting capabilities, should be explored.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s40572-017-0166-8,Liver Diseases;Fatty Liver;Liver,,
rayyan-421822292,Persistent organic pollutants and couple fecundability: a systematic review,2021,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"BACKGROUND: Despite increasing regulation, exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) remains a serious public health concern due to their accumulation in the environment and ability to biomagnify up the food chain. POPs are associated with endocrine-disrupting effects including adverse reproductive outcomes that could affect fecundability, i.e. the capacity to conceive a pregnancy, quantified as time to pregnancy (TTP). OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Results of epidemiologic studies that examine the impact of various chemical classes of POPs on TTP have not been synthesised. We undertook a systematic review to summarise the strength of evidence for associations of four common groups of POPs with couple fecundability and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature in order to inform policy decisions and future research. SEARCH METHODS: We performed an electronic search of literature published between 1 January 2007 and 6 August 2019 in MEDLINE, EMBASE.com, Global Health, DART/TOXLINE and POPLINE. We included empirical research papers that examined human exposure to organochlorine (OC) pesticides, brominated flame retardants, polychlorinated organic compounds and/or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and considered TTP or fecundability as an outcome. Standardised forms for screening, data extraction and study quality were developed using DistillerSR software, and all reviews were completed in duplicate. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias and devised additional quality metrics based on specific methodological features of fecundability studies. OUTCOMES: The search returned 4573 articles, and 28 papers from 19 different studies met inclusion criteria. Among them, four studies measured TTP prospectively, three had data on participants' prenatal exposure, three examined associations in both male and female partners and one focused exclusively on males. Analyses varied widely in terms of exposure characterisation, precluding a meta-analytic approach. Evidence was strongest for adverse associations of female exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls with TTP, with some additional support for associations of female exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers and PFAS with longer TTP. Our review provided little or no support for associations between female exposure to OC pesticides or male exposure to any of the POP groups and TTP. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Evidence suggests that female exposure to at least some POPs may reduce fecundability. Although many of these chemicals are no longer in production, they are still detectable in human biosamples because of their persistence in the environment. Replacement chemicals that are being introduced as older ones are restricted may have similar reproductive consequences. Future studies should examine these newer POPs, assess interactions between POPs and other chemical and non-chemical exposures, investigate how POPs are distributed in and metabolised by the human body and focus on populations that may be disproportionately exposed. © The Author(s) 2020.

Obesity alters metabolism, induces an inflammatory tissue microenvironment, and is also linked to diabetes and breast cancer risk/promotion of the disease. However, no direct evidence exists with regard to the correlation among all three of these factors ( POPs, obesity, and breast cancer). Herein, we present results from current correlative studies indicating a causal link between POP exposure through diet and their bioaccumulation in adipose tissue that promotes the development of obesity and ultimately influences breast cancer development and/or progression. Furthermore, as endocrine disruptors, POPs could interfere with hormonally responsive tissue functions causing dysregulation of hormone signaling and cell function. This review highlights the critical need for advanced in vitro and in vivo model systems to elucidate the complex relationship among obesity, POPs, and breast cancer, and, more importantly, to delineate their multifaceted molecular, cellular, and biochemical mechanisms.

This review comprehensively summarizes the data on the levels and distributions of POPs in selected typical lake ecosystems in China and worldwide, involving water, sediments, organisms, and surrounding soils and atmosphere. It was found that current publications on POPs in Chinese lakes are mainly related to lakes in the developed eastern plain area, with only a few studies concerning the less-developed Qinghai-Tibet Plateau area. Similarly, around the world, there are more research on POPs in developed countries and less in relatively less-developed areas. Moreover, there are significant differences in the levels of POPs in different matrices in different lake ecosystems. Legacy POPs, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), were commonly detected and reported in different lakes, while emerging POPs like perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), and hexabromocyclododecane (HCBD) were relatively less detected or reported. A comprehensive summarization on the levels and distributions of traditional and emerging POPs in lake ecosystems could be significant for further understanding the behaviors and risks of POPs in lake ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.05.060,,,
rayyan-421822295,Pollution pathways and release estimation of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in central and eastern China.,2017,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"China has gradually become the most important manufacturing and consumption centre for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the world, and inadvertently become the world's major contamination hotspots. However, a systematic analysis of pollution pathways for PFOS/PFOA into the different environmental compartments and their quantification in China has yet to be carried out. This study focused on PFOS and PFOA release into the environment in the central and eastern region of China, which accounts for the vast majority of national emission. About 80-90% of PFOS/PFOA contamination in the Chinese environment was estimated to come directly from manufacturing and industrial sites mostly via wastewater discharge from these facilities. The other major contamination sources for PFOS were identified as being linked to aqueous fire-fighting foams (AFFFs), and pesticides including sulfluramid. For PFOA, following some way behind industrial wastewater, were industrial exhaust gas, domestic wastewater and landfill leachate as contamination sources. For surface water contamination, the major pollution contributors after industrial wastewater were AFFF spill runoff for PFOS, and domestic wastewater and precipitation-runoff for PFOA. The majority of PFOS that contaminated soil was considered to be linked with infiltration of AFFF and pesticides, while most PFOA in soil was attributed to atmospheric deposition and landfill leachate. Where groundwater had become contaminated, surface water seepage was estimated to contribute about 50% of PFOS and 40% of PFOA while the remainder was mostly derived from soil leaching. A review of the available monitoring data for PFOS/PFOA in the literature supported the view that industrial wastewater, landfill leachate and AFFF application were the dominant sources. Higher concentrations of PFOA than PFOS found in precipitation also corroborated the prediction of more PFOA release into air. To reduce PFOS/PFOA contamination of the Chinese environment the focus for control should be on industrial wastewater emissions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.12.085,Sulfones;China,,

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to organochlorine (β coefficient, −0.022; 95% CI, −0.04 to −0.003) and PFAS (β coefficient, −0.017; 95% CI, −0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level.

Almost all studies were done in low-exposed populations. There are nine new studies, adding 6,019 births to the previous 6,937 births. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of 24 studies. To combine all results, we approximated results for untransformed PFOA from nine studies using log-transformed PFOA. We also included another large study, excluded from previous analyses, in a sensitivity analysis. Results: We found a change of birthweight of −10.5 g (−16.7, −4.4) for every ng/ml PFOA in maternal or cord blood. After adding one previously excluded large study, we found little evidence of an association (−1.0 g; 95% CI = −2.4, 0.4). Restricting to studies where blood was sampled from mothers early in the pregnancy or shortly before conception (5,393 births), we found little association of PFOA with birthweight (−3.3 g [−9.6, 3.0]). In studies where blood was sampled late in the pregnancy (7563 pregnancies), lower birthweight was associated with higher PFOA (−17.8 [−25.0, −10.6]). Conclusion: Present human evidence provides only modest support for decreased birthweight with increasing PFOA. Studies with a wide range of exposure, and studies with blood sampled early in pregnancy, showed little or no association of PFOA with birthweight.

rayyan-421822299,Signaling in a polluted world: Oxidative stress as an overlooked mechanism linking contaminants to animal communication,2016,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"The capacity to communicate effectively with other individuals plays a critical role in the daily life of an individual and can have important fitness consequences. Animals rely on a number of visual and non-visual signals, whose production brings costs to the individual. The theory of honest signaling states that these costs are higher for low than for high-quality individuals, which prevents cheating and makes signals, such as skin and plumage coloration, indicators of individual's quality or condition. The condition-dependent nature of signals makes them ideally suited as indicators of environmental quality, implying that signal production might be affected by contaminants. In this mini-review article, we have made the point that oxidative stress (OS) is one overlooked mechanism linking exposure to contaminants to signaling because (i) many contaminants can influence the individual's oxidative balance, and (ii) generation of both visual and non-visual signals is sensitive to OS. To this end, we have provided the first comprehensive review on the way both non-organic (heavy metals, especially mercury) and organic [persistent organic pollutants (POPs)] contaminants may influence either OS or sexual signaling. We have also paid special attention to emerging classes of pollutants like brominated flame-retardants (BFRs) and perfluoroalkoxy alkanes (PFAs) in order to stimulate research in this area. We have finally provided suggestions and warnings for future work on the links among OS, sexual signaling, and contaminant exposure. © 2016 Marasco and Costantini.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.3389/fevo.2016.00095,Animals;Oxidative Stress;Animal Shells,,
rayyan-421822300,Socio-Economic Status and Health: Evaluation of Human Biomonitored Chemical Exposure to Per- and Polyfluorinated Substances across Status,2018,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"Research on the environment, health, and well-being nexus (EHWB) is shifting from a silo toward a systemic approach that includes the socio-economic context. To disentangle further the complex interplay between the socio-exposome and internal chemical exposure, we performed a meta-analysis of human biomonitoring (HBM) studies with internal exposure data on per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and detailed information on risk factors, including descriptors of socio-economic status (SES) of the study population. PFASs are persistent in nature, and some have endocrine-disrupting properties. Individual studies have shown that HBM biomarker concentrations of PFASs generally increase with SES indicators, e.g., for income. Based on a meta-analysis (five studies) of the associations between PFASs and SES indicators, the magnitude of the association could be estimated. For the SES indicator income, changes in income were expressed by a factor change, which was corrected by the Gini coefficient to take into account the differences in income categories between studies, and the income range between countries. For the SES indicator education, we had to conclude that descriptors (<college, x years of study, etc.) differed too widely between studies to perform a meta-analysis. Therefore, the use of the uniform ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education) is recommended in future studies. The meta-analysis showed that a higher income is associated with a higher internal exposure to PFASs (PFOS or perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, PFOA or perfluorooctanoic acid, PFNA or perfluorononanoic acid, PFHxS or perfluorohexane sulfonate). This is opposite to the environmental justice hypothesis, referring to an inequitable distribution of detrimental environmental effects toward poor and minority communities by a practice or policy. With a doubling of the income, internal exposure increased on average by 10%–14%. Possible explanations for this difference are given, e.g., underlying differences in diet. However, other sources can also contribute, and the exact causes of SES-related differences in PFAS concentrations remain unclear. Studies are needed that include social descriptors together with lifestyle and dietary information as explanatory variables for internal chemical exposure levels. This will help clarify the underlying factors that link SES with inequity to environmental exposures, and will raise awareness and knowledge to strengthen the capacities of people and communities to advocate chemical exposure reduction in order to reduce this health inequity. © 2018 by the authors.

rayyan-421822301,Solution by dilution?-A review on the pollution status of the Yangtze River,2013,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"The Yangtze River has been a source of life and prosperity for the Chinese people for centuries and is a habitat for a remarkable variety of aquatic species. But the river suffers from huge amounts of urban sewage, agricultural effluents, and industrial wastewater as well as ship navigation wastes along its course. With respect to the vast amounts of water and sediments discharged by the Yangtze River, it is reasonable to ask whether the pollution problem may be solved by simple dilution. This article reviews the past two decades of published research on organic pollutants in the Yangtze River and several adjacent water bodies connected to the main stream, according to a holistic approach. Organic pollutant levels and potential effects of water and sediments on wildlife and humans, measured in vitro, in vivo, and in situ, were critically reviewed. The contamination with organic pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and others, of water and sediment along the river was described. Especially Wuhan section and the Yangtze Estuary exhibited stronger pollution than other sections. Bioassays, displaying predominantly the endpoints mutagenicity and endocrine disruption, applied at sediments, drinking water, and surface water indicated a potential health risk in several areas. Aquatic organisms exhibited detectable concentrations of toxic compounds like PCBs, OCPs, PBDEs, and PFCs. Genotoxic effects could also be assessed in situ in fish. To summarize, it can be stated that dilution reduces the ecotoxicological risk in the Yangtze River, but does not eliminate it. Keeping in mind an approximately 14 times greater water discharge compared to the major European river Rhine, the absolute pollution mass transfer of the Yangtze River is of severe concern for the environmental quality of its estuary and the East China Sea.

rayyan-421822303,"Systematic Review, An Illustration of Increased Transparency in a Framework for Evaluating Immunotoxicity Associated with PFOA and PFOS Exposure",2015,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"Background: Systematic review methodologies were first developed to assess the efficacy of health care interventions, but these approaches can be adapted to evaluations of environmental health questions such as immunotoxicity associated with PFOA and PFOS exposure. This structured approach provides objectivity and transparency to the process of collecting, synthesizing, and reaching conclusions based on the scientific evidence available. Objectives: To outline the process of systematic review and evidence integration and demonstrate each step by following a single research question from start to finish. The example systematic review will evaluate the evidence that PFOA and PFOS exposure are associated with immunotoxicity – using a subset of the available evidence to illustrate concepts, not to develop hazard identification conclusions. Methods: The Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Approach to evaluating the scientific evidence for immunotoxicity of PFOA and PFOS is detailed in a protocol that is laid out in seven steps: scoping and problem formulation, search for and select studies for inclusion, extract data from studies, assess quality of individual studies, rate confidence in the body of evidence, translate confidence ratings into level of evidence, and integrate evidence to develop hazard identification conclusions incorporating human, animal, and mechanistic evidence. Results and Discussion: Eligibility criteria for identifying important exposures and outcomes were presented as the basis for assembling the relevant studies for evaluating whether or not PFOA or PFOS exposure is associated with immunotoxicity (human, n = 18; animal, n = 80; and mechanistic/in vitro assays, n = 19). A tool for assessing study quality in terms of risk of bias or internal validity was tailored to the research question – particularly for evaluating PFC exposure and assessing immunological outcomes. An example of an evidence profile is provided to illustrate the basis for confidence ratings using a hypothetical set of studies of PFOS and functional antibody response. Finally, a discussion is presented on how the hazard identification conclusions would be reached and interpreted by integrating the human, animal, and mechanistic evidence. Conclusion: The OHAT Approach to hazard identification of health effects of PFCs is illustrated with a case study on PFOA/PFOS and immunotoxicity. Communication of the evaluation process is enhanced by using objective, reproducible methods that transparently document scientific judgments and the scientific basis for hazard identification conclusions. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1007/978-3-319-15518-0_16,,,
rayyan-421822304,The Association between ADHD and Environmental Chemicals—A Scoping Review,2022,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"The role of environmental chemicals in the etiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been of interest in recent research. This scoping review aims to summarize known or possible associations between ADHD and environmental exposures to substances selected as priority chemicals of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU). Literature searches were performed in PubMed to identify relevant publications. Only meta-analyses and review articles were included, as they provide more extensive evidence compared to individual studies. The collected evidence indicated that lead (Pb), phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) are moderately to highly associated with ADHD. Limited evidence exists for an association between ADHD and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), flame retardants, mercury (Hg), and pesticides. The evidence of association between ADHD and cadmium (Cd) and per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) based on the identified reviews was low but justified further research. The methods of the individual studies included in the reviews and meta-analyses covered in the current paper varied considerably. Making precise conclusions in terms of the strength of evidence on association between certain chemicals and ADHD was not straightforward.

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to verify this association by reviewing existing studies and to provide a strong basis for preventing ADHD. The researchers searched electronic databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Embase for all studies published before October 2020. Finally, we included nine articles for analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that maternal exposure to PFASs was not significantly associated with the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD (perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), odds ratio (OR) = 1.00, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.75–1.25; perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.88–1.14; perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.80–1.09; perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.99–1.28; perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.15–2.32). Due to significant heterogeneity, we subsequently performed subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. Through subgroup analysis, we found that PFOS concentration of children’s blood and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD were statistically positively correlated, and there was also a positive correlation between PFOS exposure and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD in the America. Moreover, there was also a statistically positive correlation between PFNA concentration in maternal blood and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD. Sensitivity analysis showed that the final results did not change much, the sensitivity was low, and the results were relatively stable. In conclusion, a causal relationship between maternal PFASs exposure and ADHD in children was unlikely. Among them, PFOS, PFNA, and ADHD might have positive associations worthy of further investigation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s11356-021-15136-2,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity;Only Child;Child,,

rayyan-421822307,The epidemiologic evidence linking prenatal and postnatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals with male reproductive disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2016,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"BACKGROUND: More than 20 years ago, it was hypothesized that exposure to prenatal and early postnatal environmental xenobiotics with the potential to disrupt endogenous hormone signaling might be on the causal path to cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low sperm count and testicular cancer. Several consensus statements and narrative reviews in recent years have divided the scientific community and have elicited a call for systematic transparent reviews. We aimed to fill this gap in knowledge in the field of male reproductive disorders. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The aim of this study was to systematically synthesize published data on the risk of cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low sperm counts and testicular cancer following in utero or infant exposure to chemicals that have been included on the European Commission's list of Category 1 endocrine disrupting chemicals defined as having documented adverse effects due to endocrine disruption in at least one intact organism. SEARCH METHODS: A systematic literature search for original peer reviewed papers was performed in the databases PubMed and Embase to identify epidemiological studies reporting associations between the outcomes of interest and exposures documented by biochemical analyses of biospecimens including maternal blood or urine, placenta or fat tissue as well as amnion fluid, cord blood or breast milk; this was followed by meta-analysis of quantitative data. OUTCOMES: The literature search resulted in 1314 references among which we identified 33 papers(28 study populations) fulfilling the eligibility criteria. These provided 85 risk estimates of links between persistent organic pollutants and rapidly metabolized compounds (phthalates and Bisphenol A) and male reproductive disorders. The overall odds ratio (OR) across all exposures and outcomes was 1.11 (95% CI 0.91-1.35). When assessing four specific chemical subgroups with sufficient data for meta-analysis for all outcomes, we found that exposure to one of the four compounds, p,p'-DDE, was related to an elevated risk: OR 1.35 (95% CI 1.04-1.74). The data did not indicate that this increased risk was driven by any specific disorder. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The current epidemiological evidence is compatible with a small increased risk of male reproductive disorders following prenatal and postnatal exposure to some persistent environmental chemicals classified as endocrine disruptors but the evidence is limited. Future epidemiological studies may change the weight of the evidence in either direction. No evidence of distortion due to publication bias was found, but exposure-response relationships are not evident. There are insufficient data on rapidly metabolized endocrine disruptors and on specific exposure-outcome relations. A particular data gap is evident with respect to delayed effects on semen quality and testicular cancer. Although high quality epidemiological studies are still sparse, future systematic and transparent reviews may provide pieces of evidence contributing to the narrative and weight of the evidence assessments in the field. © The Author 2016.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: full text checked",10.1093/humupd/dmw036,,,

Using food consumption and body weight parameters, estimated dietary intakes (EDIs) were calculated for evaluation using the Scenario-Based Risk Assessment (SceBRA) modelling. Among food groups, the highest ΣPFAAs concentrations and EDI contributions were both found in poultry (363 ng/g), fish and shrimp (313 ng/g), dark vegetables (309 ng/g), fruits (116 ng/g) and pork (25 ng/g). The EDI of adults in the high-exposure scenario was about twice that of the intermediate-exposure scenario, while the EDI of children was about twice that of adults’ EDI in the intermediate-exposure scenario. In addition, the PFOS EDI for children under high exposure approached its tolerable daily intake (TDI). Therefore high dietary exposure to PFAAs is giving rise to an increased health risk, especially for children. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1080/19440049.2017.1347282,Risk Assessment;China;Food,,

Despite recent increases in published data, there is limited information on how POP concentrations have changed, post ratification of the Stockholm Convention. As a result, this review aims to address these knowledge gaps by collating available data that reported POPs in Ghanaian environmental matrices, identify spatial and temporal trends, and establish potential health risks. It is worth noting that Ghana has not developed its own regulatory standards for POPs, but adapts United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) standards. Results obtained showed concentrations in excess of USEPA regulatory standards for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl sulphonates (PFASs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) in water, polychlorinated and polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs) in e-waste soils, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in aquatic organisms and dairy products.

However, the data did indicate decreasing concentrations of some legacy POPs in soil/sediment and aquatic organisms, with increasing concentrations of some POPs in water, fish, fruits and vegetables. Studies that performed health risks assessments were limited although the data indicated risks to e-waste workers, some farmers and vulnerable sub-populations. This review identified potential human health risks from POPs in the Ghanaian environment and the need for more consistent and widespread monitoring program. This paper provides a critical review of studies of POPs in Ghana which can be used as a reference for all of Africa, as well as other developing countries, for compliance with the requirements for POPs monitoring in the e-waste, food and environmental sectors to inform the mitigation of health risks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.envpol.2018.10.107,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Ghana,,
rayyan-421822312,Toxicological function of adipose tissue: Focus on persistent organic pollutants,2013,1,1,,,,,,NA,,,,,"Background: A dipose tissue (AT) is involved in several physiological functions, including metabolic regulation, energy storage, and endocrine functions. Objectives: In this review we examined the evidence that an additional function of AT is to modulate persistent organic pollutant (POP) toxicity through several mechanisms. Methods: We reviewed the literature on the interaction of AT with POPs to provide a comprehensive model for this additional function of AT. discussion: As a storage compartment for lipophilic POPs, AT plays a critical role in the toxico-kinetics of a variety of drugs and pollutants, in particular, POPs. By sequestering POPs, AT can protect other organs and tissues from POPs overload. However, this protective function could prove to be a threat in the long run. Te accumulation of lipophilic POPs will increase total body burden. These accumulated POPs are slowly released into the bloodstream, and more so during weight loss. Thus, AT constitutes a continual source of internal exposure to POPs. In addition to its buffering function, AT is also a target of POPs and may mediate part of their metabolic effects. This is particularly relevant because many POPs induce obesogenic effects that may lead to quantitative and qualitative alterations of AT. Some POPs also induce a proinflammatory state in AT, which may lead to detrimental metabolic effects. Conclusion: AT appears to play diverse functions both as a modulator and as a target of POPs toxicity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1289/ehp.1205485,Adipose Tissue,,

Although overexploitation and habitat degradation are the two biggest threats to batoid populations, coastal and oceanic pollution is also a pervasive potential threat. In this systematic review, we compile published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea superorder and present contamination patterns, expos re effects, and potential human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found batoids to accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Accumulation of POPs is reported for chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Hg levels in muscle tissue were significantly different among oceanic basins and habitats, consistent with previous global assessments of Hg oceanic background levels. Some batoid species presented Hg levels higher than large pelagic teleost fishes and comparable to sharks. Ecological traits such as, bottom feeding, upper trophic position and elasmobranch-specific physiology and metabolism are discussed as potential factors associated with Hg uptake and accumulation in batoids. Some species exceeded USEPA’s maximum contamination safety limits in edible tissues for Hg, As and ΣPCBs. For most trace metals and POPs, there is a lack of studies focusing on contamination levels in batoids. We recommend future research increasing reporting on POPs and trace metals besides Hg in batoids to further investigate the role of Elasmobranch as a bioindicator for marine pollution. ; San Diego State University","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",NA,California,,

Consumption of PFAS-contaminated agricultural products represents a feasible pathway for the trophic transfer of these toxic chemicals along food chains/webs, leading to risks associated with human and animal health. Recently, studies on plant uptake and accumulation of PFASs have rapidly increased; consequently, a review to summarize the current knowledge and highlight future research is needed. Analysis of the publications indicates that a large variety of plant species can take up PFASs from the environment. Vegetables and grains are the most commonly investigated crops, with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) as the most studied PFASs. The potential sources of PFASs for plant uptake include industrial emissions, irrigation with contaminated water, land application of biosolids, leachates from landfill sites, and pesticide application. Root uptake is the predominant pathway for the accumulation of PFASs in agricultural crops, and uptake by plant aboveground portions from the ambient atmosphere could play a minor role in the overall PFAS accumulation. PFAS uptake by plants is influenced by physicochemical properties of compounds (e.g., perfluorocarbon chain length, head group functionality, water solubility, and volatility), plant physiology (e.g., transpiration rate, lipid and protein content), and abiotic factors (e.g., soil organic matters, pH, salinity, and temperature).

Two major PFA subclasses are the perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) and carboxylic acids (PFCAs). The physicochemical properties and partitioning behavior for the linear PFA members are poorly understood and widely debated. Even less is known about the numerous branched congeners with varying perfluoroalkyl chain lengths, leading to confounding issues around attempts to constrain the properties of PFAs. Current computational methods are not adequate for reliable multimedia modeling efforts and risk assessments. These compounds are widely present in surface, ground, marine, and drinking waters at concentrations that vary from pg L- 1 to g L- 1. Concentration gradients of up to several orders of magnitude are observed in all types of aquatic systems and reflect proximity to known industrial sources concentrated near populated regions. Some wastewaters contain PFAs at mg L- 1 to low g L- 1 levels, or up to 10 orders of magnitude higher than present in more pristine receiving waters. With the exception of trifluoroacetic acid, which is thought to have both significant natural and anthropogenic sources, all PFSAs and PFCAs are believed to arise from human activities. Filtration and sorption technologies offer the most promising existing removal methods for PFAs in aqueous waste streams, although sonochemical approaches hold promise. Additional studies need to be conducted to better define opportunities from evaporative, extractive, thermal, advanced oxidative, direct and catalyzed photochemical, reductive, and biodegradation methods. Most PFA treatment methods exhibit slow kinetic profiles, hindering their direct application in conventional low hydraulic residence time systems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",10.1080/10934520903139811,Sulfones;Carboxylic Acids,,

The aim of this review is to summarize several studies in Japan and characterize the toxicities of these compounds. We also compared the levels of contamination with those reported from various countries to illustrate the unique situation of the toxicological issues within Japan. PFOA and PFOS concentrations in surface water in Japan are in the ranges of 0.1-67,000 ng/L and 0.1-526 ng/L, respectively. While the origin of PFOS in surface water remains unknown, PFOA present in surface water is very likely to have been released from a few industries. The levels of PFOA and PFOS in the atmosphere are 71.8-919 pg/m3 and 2.3-21.8 pg/m3, respectively. The concentrations of PFOA and PFOS in Japanese serum range from an undetectable level to 52.2 ng/ml and from 0.2 to 57.7 ng/ml, respectively. The levels of PFOA and PFOS present in the serum of the inhabitants of Kyoto are higher than those of other cities. One epidemiological study conducted by 3M revealed an increase in prostate cancer mortality [3.3-fold increase (95% CI, 1.02-10.6)] among workers exposed to PFOA. Another study conducted by 3M revealed an increase in bladder cancer mortality (SMR 12.77, 95% CI 2.63-37.35) among workers exposed to PFOS. PFOA and PFOS had a low order of toxicity in an acute toxicity study in rodents; however, they exhibited versatile toxicities in primates. Both chemicals are carcinogenic in rodents, causing reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity.

Long term consequences of the newborns' contamination by PFAS on thyroid function are of concern. The aim of this study is to assess the potential associations between PFAS contamination measured at birth and thyroid function assessed few months later. PFAS levels were previously determined in cord blood from a cohort of newborns recruited in Liege. METHOD: Parents of the children belonging to the first and the fifth quintiles of exposure to PFAS were contacted in order to measure the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in their child few months after birth. Twenty-eight children participated in the study. Moreover, we performed a literature review about associations between pre- or perinatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants and thyroid function during early childhood. RESULT: No significant difference was highlighted between both groups of contamination (Mann-Whitney, p-value = 0.91). Literature review highlighted the critical need of new longitudinal data about this problematic. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the PFAS levels at birth are not associated with TSH levels later in life. Large scale studies are required to confirm our results.Objectif : Notre but est d’étudier les associations potentielles entre contamination par les composés perfluorés (PFC) mesurée à la naissance et fonction thyroïdienne évaluée quelques mois plus tard.

These compounds are ubiquitously bioaccumulated in the environment and food chain for a long period due to their high chemical and biological stability. PFOS and PFOA are currently being transmitted via the aquatic medium, posing a concern not only to the aquatic ecosystem but also to human and animal health. Evidence of PFOS and PFOA-based toxicity has been associated with hepatoxicity, immunotoxicity, developmental toxicity, endocrine disruptor, and cancer. PFOS and PFOA are primarly absorbed into the animal and human body through ingestion and bioaccumulate in the plasma, liver, and kidney. PFOS and PFOA are difficult to degrade, and as a result, they are frequently excreted in urine in their unchanged form. Methods for detecting PFOS and PFOA at trace levels in environmental and food matrices have been improved over time, resulting in their detection in a variety of environmental and food matrices. Nowadays, PFOS and PFOS have been identified as potential hazards and are included as novel persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the Stockholm Convention, however their use in some countries such as Malaysia is unregulated. Although PFOS and PFOA have been widely explored in the environment and in food, and toxicological effects in some animals have been identified, human studies warrant further investigation. © 2021 UPM Press.
