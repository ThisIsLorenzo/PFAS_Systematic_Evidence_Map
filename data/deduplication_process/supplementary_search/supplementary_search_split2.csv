This review presents the fundamental scientific principles underpinning the operation of polymers for gas separations, including the solution-diffusion model and various structure/property relations, describes membrane fabrication technology, describes polymers believed to be used commercially for gas separations, and discusses some challenges associated with membrane materials development. A description of new classes of polymers being considered for gas separations, largely to overcome existing challenges or access applications that are not yet practiced commercially, is also provided. Some classes of polymers discussed in this review that have been the focus of much recent work include thermally rearranged (TR) polymers, polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), perfluoropolymers, and high-performance polyimides. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Concurrently, many regulatory agencies are publishing criteria used in practice to define the ""nature and extent""of PFAS-impacted environmental media. Specific to the soil-to-groundwater transport pathway protective of the groundwater ingestion end point, these soil criteria (or screening values) are to date exclusively based on the traditional approach used for hydrophobic organics with a number of simplifying assumptions. Research has clearly contradicted these assumptions, yet alternative methodologies have yet to emerge from the literature. This Perspective provides a rationale for why alternative approaches are critically necessary and proposes the application of lysimetry as a practical solution to accurately assess PFAS transport within unsaturated vadose zone soils. Ultimately, there is an urgent need to justify soil remediation on the basis of groundwater protection and to prioritize remedial efforts in order to optimize limited fiscal resources. © Not subject to U.S. Copyright.

As such, it is important in several biological recognition/communication events mediated by sialic acid recognising proteins that play integral roles in these phenomena. It is therefore necessary to develop synthetic routes to sialic acid and its derivatives and analogues. Many of these routes have led to compounds used as enzyme inhibitors for treatment of disease states and also as probes of biologically relevant binding events and of the mechanisms of enzyme action. Every position on the nine-carbon backbone of sialic acid has been derivatised for such purposes, being synthesised both chemoenzymatically and chemically from precursors ranging from non-carbohydrate sources to sialic acid itself. This review describes various synthetic strategies developed for the synthesis of sialic acid and its variants at each position on the carbon skeleton. 1 Introduction 2 Naturally Occurring Variants 3 Synthesis of Sialic Acid 3.1 Enzymatic Syntheses 3.2 Chemical Syntheses 4 Substituted Sialic Acid Analogues 4.1 Substitution at Cl 4.2 Variation at C3 4.3 Modification at C4 4.4 Amide Variation at C5 4.5 Modification at C6 4.5.1 Substitution of the Ring Oxygen 4.5.2 Substitution of the Glycerol Side Chain 4.6 Modifications at C7, C8, and C9 5 Conclusions. © Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart.","Organometallic reagents; Ozonolysis; Sialic acids; Synthetic routes; Biological systems; Carbohydrates; Derivatives; Oligosaccharides; Proteins; Stereoselectivity; Amino acids; 3 deoxy d glycero d galacto non 2 ulopyranosonic acid; 3 deoxy d manno oct 2 ulopyranosonic acid; acetic acid derivative; aldehyde; alkene; enzyme inhibitor; mannosamine; methyl [bis_2,2,2 trifluoroethoxy)phosphoryl]acetate; n acetylmannosamine; n acetylneuraminic acid; n bromosuccinimide; n glycoloylneuraminic acid; oligosaccharide; osmium tetraoxide; phosphoenolpyruvate; pyran derivative; sialic acid; unclassified drug; ammonolysis; chemical structure; coupling factor; cycloaddition; deacetylation; debromination; decarboxylation; deprotection reaction; drug synthesis; enzyme synthesis; Horner Wadsworth Emmons reaction; hydroboration; nonhuman; olefination; oxidation reduction reaction; ozonolysis; phosphorylation; review; stereochemistry; Wittig reaction"

A literature search for bioconcentration factors (BCFs) and bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for PFAS has been done, and data for 22 taxonomic classes were assembled. The assembled data were evaluated for quality, and for gaps and limitations in bioaccumulation information for the PFAS universe of chemicals. In general, carbonyl and sulfonyl PFAS classes are relatively data rich, whereas phosphate, fluorotelomer, and ether PFAS classes are data limited for fish and nonexistent for most other taxonomic classes. Taxonomic classes with the most measurements were, in descending order, Teleostei (fish), Bivalvia, and Malacostraca. For fish, median whole-body log BAFs (L/kg wet wt) for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid and perfluorooctanoic acid were 3.55 (standard deviation [SD] = 0.83, n = 84) and 2.16 (SD = 0.85, n = 48) using all measurements, respectively. In comparison with freshwater species, data are limited for marine species, and further research is needed to determine whether the BAFs for freshwater and marine species should be the same or different. The BAFs for some PFAS appear to be consistent with the BCFs developed with laboratory experiments, in which values decline with increasing concentrations in water.

These compounds, being very polar, are able to spread through the surface waters, and reach groundwaters and drinking water sources. The challenges in the analysis of these compounds in water include their poor extraction efficiencies from environmental matrices and weak retention in conventional chromatographic columns. As a result, the toxicity and environmental fate of PMOCs are largely unknown. This review will examine recent developments in sorbent and chromatographic column technologies, and other sample preparation strategies that will enable analysis of PMOCs and advance our knowledge on their fate and transport in the environment. In addition, analysis of these compounds in water via liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) are discussed in this review. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",NA

Data on clinical symptoms, prevalence, diagnosis, and immunotherapies for the treatment of Rosaceae allergy are herein stated. Allergen molecular characterization, cross-reactivity/co-sensitization phenomena, the impact of food processing and digestibility, and the methods currently available for the Rosaceae detection/quantification in foods are also described. Rosaceae allergy has a major impact in context to pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS) and lipid transfer protein (LTP) allergies, being greatly influenced by geography, environment, and presence of cofactors. Peach, apple, and almond allergies are probably the ones most affecting the quality of life of the allergic-patients, although allergies to other Rosaceae fruits cannot be overlooked. From patients’ perspective, self-allergy management and an efficient avoidance of multiple fruits are often difficult to achieve, which might raise the risk for cross-reactivity and co-sensitization phenomena and increase the severity of the induced allergic responses with time. At this point, the absence of effective allergy diagnosis (lack of specific molecular markers) and studies advancing potential immunotherapies are some gaps that certainly will prompt the progress on novel strategies to manage Rosaceae food allergies. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Allergens; Allergies; Food processing; Fruits; Clinical relevance; Co-sensitization; Cross-reactivity; Cross-reactivity/co-sensitization phenomenon; Detection methods; Food allergen; Food allergies; Food processing and digestibility; Lipid transfer protein; Lipid transfer protein allergy; Pollen-food allergy syndrome; Diagnosis

It is required for healing wounds and infections. Despite their indispensable role in microbial killing, the inflammation reactions may also cause diseases to a host such as hay fever, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The enzymes and oxidizing species released during the inflammatory process can cause damages to the host tissues which lead to inflammatory syndromes. The role of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the inflammatory reactions is well documented. It contributes in killing the pathogens but it is also implicated in several inflammatory syndromes such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis. Thus, this enzyme has attracted more attention of the scientists and it has become a target for drug designing. In the last decade, several reversible and irreversible MPO inhibitors were identified as very high potent inhibitors such as fluoroalkylindole, aromatic hydroxamic acid, thioxanthine and benzoic acid hydrazide derivatives. In this review, we tried to illustrate the MPO inhibitors and highlight their structure activity relationship (SAR).

The long retention times and large surface areas exposed to light potentially allow more opportunities for EC removal to occur, but experimental evidence is lacking to enable definite predictions about EC fate across different algal WWT systems. This study reviews the mechanisms of EC hydrolysis, sorption, biodegradation, and photodegradation, applying available knowledge to the case of algal WWT. From this basis the review identifies three main areas that need more research due to the unique environmental and ecological conditions occurring in algal WWT ponds: i) the effect of diurnally fluctuating pH and dissolved oxygen upon removal mechanisms; ii) the influence of algae and algal biomass on biodegradation and sorption under relevant conditions; and iii) the significance of EC photodegradation in the presence of dissolved and suspended materials. Because of the high concentration of dissolved organics typically found in algal WWT ponds, most EC photodegradation likely occurs via indirect mechanisms rather than direct photolysis in these systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Algae; Antibiotics; Biodegradation; Dissolution; Dissolved oxygen; Drug products; Impurities; Lakes; Photodegradation; Photolysis; Ponds; Ecological conditions; Emerging contaminant; Emerging contaminant (ECs); Emerging pollutants; Estrogen; Experimental evidence; HRAP; Waste-water treatment ponds; Wastewater treatment; antibiotic agent; dissolved oxygen; surface water; water; waste water; alga; antibiotics; biodegradation; estrogenic compound; hydrolysis; organic pollutant; photodegradation; pollutant removal; pond; research work; sorption; wastewater; water treatment; alga; antibiotic resistance; biodegradation; conjugation; degradation; human; hydrolysis; microbial biomass; nonhuman; pH; photodegradation; pond; Review; waste component removal; waste water management; water contamination; biomass; bioremediation; chemistry; metabolism; microalga; photolysis; pond; sewage; waste water; algae; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biomass; Microalgae; Photolysis; Ponds; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water"

PFAS have been detected in the blood, liver, kidney, heart, muscle and brain of various species. Although brain is not a dominant tissue for PFAS accumulation compared to blood and liver, adverse effects of PFAS on brain functions have been identified. Here, we review studies related to the absorption, accumulation, distribution and toxicity of PFAS in the brain. We summarize evidence on two potential mechanisms of PFAS entering the brain: initiating blood-brain barrier (BBB) disassembly through disrupting tight junctions and relying on transporters located at the BBB. PFAS with diverse structures and properties enter and accumulate in the brain with varying efficiencies. Compared to long-chain PFAS, short-chain PFAS may not cross cerebral barriers effectively. According to biomonitoring studies and PFAS exposure experiments, PFAS can accumulate in the brain of humans and wildlife species. With respect to the distribution of PFAS in specific brain regions, the brain stem, hippocampus, hypothalamus, pons/medulla and thalamus are dominant for PFAS accumulation. The accumulation and distribution of PFAS in the brain may lead to toxic effects in the central nervous system (CNS), including PFAS-induced behavioral and cognitive disorders. The specific mechanisms underlying such PFAS-induced neurotoxicity remain to be explored, but two major potential mechanisms based on current understanding are PFAS effects on calcium homeostasis and neurotransmitter alterations in neurons. Based on the information available about PFAS uptake, accumulation, distribution and impacts on the brain, PFAS have the potential to enter and accumulate in the brain at varying levels. The balance of existing studies shows there is some indication of risk in animals, while the human evidence is mixed and warrants further scrutiny.

Complement factors are produced in adipose tissue and appear to be involved in adipose tissue metabolism and local inflammation. Thereby complement links adipose tissue inflammation to systemic metabolic derangements, such as low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. Furthermore, complement has been implicated in pathophysiological mechanisms of diet- and alcohol induced liver damage, hyperglycaemia, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis and fibrinolysis.In this review, we summarize current evidence on the role of the complement system in several processes of human cardiometabolic disease. C3 is the central component in complement activation, and has most widely been studied in humans. C3 concentrations are associated with insulin resistance, liver dysfunction, risk of the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and CVD. C3 can be activated by the classical, the lectin and the alternative pathway of complement activation; and downstream activation of C3 activates the terminal pathway. Complement may also be activated via extrinsic proteases of the coagulation, fibrinolysis and the kinin systems. Studies on the different complement activation pathways in human cardiometabolic disease are limited, but available evidence suggests that they may have distinct roles in processes underlying cardiometabolic disease. The lectin pathway appeared beneficial in some studies on type 2 diabetes and CVD, while factors of the classical and the alternative pathway were related to unfavourable cardiometabolic traits.

These proteins are directed to the division site by the combination of two negative regulatory systems. Nucleoid occlusion is a poorly understood mechanism whereby the nucleoid prevents division in the cylindrical part of the cell, until chromosome segregation has occurred near midcell. The Min proteins prevent division in the nucleoid-free spaces near the cell poles in a manner that is beginning to be understood in cytological and biochemical terms. The hierarchy whereby the essential division proteins assemble at the midcell division site has been worked out for both E. coli and B. subtilis. They can be divided into essentially three classes depending on their position in the hierarchy and, to a certain extent, their subcellular localization. FtsZ is a cytosolic tubulin-like protein that polymerizes into an oligomeric structure that forms the initial ring at midcell. FtsA is another cytosolic protein that is related to actin, but its precise function is unclear. The cytoplasmic proteins are linked to the membrane by putative membrane anchor proteins, such as ZipA of E. coli and possibly EzrA of B. subtilis, which have a single membrane span but a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. The remaining proteins are either integral membrane proteins or transmembrane proteins with their major domains outside the cell. The functions of most of these proteins are unclear with the exception of at least one penicillin-binding protein, which catalyzes a key step in cell wall synthesis in the division septum.","bacterial protein; cell cycle protein; FtsZ protein; membrane protein; MinC protein; MinD protein; penicillin binding protein; peptidoglycan; protein FtsA; protein FtsI; protein FtsK; protein FtsL; protein FtsN; protein FtsQ; protein FtsW; protein MinE; protein ZipA; unclassified drug; anchorage independent growth; bacterial growth; bacterial membrane; bacterium; cell division; cellular distribution; cytokinesis; DNA replication; nonhuman; protein assembly; protein function; protein localization; protein polymerization; review; sporogenesis; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Carrier Proteins; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Division; Cell Membrane; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Escherichia coli Proteins; Hexosyltransferases; Membrane Proteins; Multienzyme Complexes; Muramoylpentapeptide Carboxypeptidase; Penicillin-Binding Proteins; Peptidoglycan; Peptidoglycan Glycosyltransferase; Peptidyl Transferases; Spores, Bacterial; Bacillus subtilis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli"

Here we review emerging pollutants in wastewater treatment plants, before and after anaerobic digestion. We present their inhibitory effects and remediation methods to alleviate inhibition. Pharmaceuticals have been detected in about 50% of the sludge samples. Sewage sludge contaminants include 19% of diuretics, 16–21% of lipid-modifying agents, hydrochlorothiazide, diclofenac, furosemide, clarithromycin, atorvastatin, and carbamazepine. Levels of antibiotics, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and estrone range from 500 to 600 ng/g in sludges from wastewater treatment plants. Remediation methods comprise electrooxidation, ultrasonication, thermal hydrolysis, ozonation, and bioaugmentation. Fermenting the sludges with acidogenic bacteria reduces the level of emerging pollutants in the supernatant. Nonetheless, liquid digestates still contains emerging pollutants such as sunscreen octocrylene at 147 ug/L and acetaminophen at 58.6 ug/L.

Antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) are a class of emerging pollutants that are difficult to remove once introduced. Understanding the environmental transfer of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) and ARGs is pivotal for creating control measures. In this review, we summarize the research progress on the spread and detection of ARB and ARG pollution related to animal husbandry. Molecular methods such as high-throughput sequencing have greatly enriched the information about ARB communities. However, it remains challenging to delineate mechanisms regarding ARG induction, transmission, and tempo-spatial changes in the whole process, from animal husbandry to multiple ecosystems. As a result, future research should be more focused on the mechanisms of ARG induction, transmission, and control.

Assembly of proteins into the cytokinetic ring appears to occur in a hierarchial order that is initiated by the FtsZ protein, a structural and functional analog of eukaryotic tubulins. Placement of the division site at its correct location in Escherichia coil requires a division inhibitor (MinC), that is responsible for preventing septation at unwanted sites near the cell poles, and a topological specificity protein (MinE), that forms a ring at midcell and protects the midcell site from the division inhibitor. However, the mechanism responsible for identifying the position of the midcell site or the polar sites used for spore septum formation is still unclear. Regulation of the division process and its coordination with other cell cycle events, such as chromosome replication, are poorly understood. However, a protein has been identified in Caulobacter (CtrA) that regulates both the initiation of chromosome regulation and the transcription of ftsZ, and that may play an important role in the coordination process.","bacterial protein; tubulin; Caulobacter; cell cycle; cell division; cell shape; chromosome replication; Escherichia coli; morphogenesis; priority journal; protein assembly; review; transcription regulation; translation regulation; Cell Division; Escherichia coli; Protein Biosynthesis; Transcription, Genetic; Bacteria (microorganisms); Caulobacter; Escherichia; Escherichia coli; Eukaryota; Negibacteria"

This review focuses on recent experimental advances for candidate obesogens that target nuclear hormone receptors when a direct link between exposure, modulation of transcriptional networks and adipogenic phenotypes can be rationalized. Recent Findings: Various endocrine disrupting chemicals can disrupt hormonal signaling relevant to adipose tissue biology. In this review, progress on one identified obesogen, the organotin tributyltin, will be outlined to highlight principles and novel insights into its high-affinity nuclear hormone receptor-mediated mechanism, its effects on adipocyte biology, its potential to promote long-term obesogenic changes and its epidemiological relevance. When appropriate, important results for other suspected obesogenic ligands, including bisphenol A, phthalates, polybrominated diphenyl ethers and perfluoro-compounds, will highlight corroborating principles. Summary: These examples serve to provide perspective on the potential harm that man-made obesogenic pollutants pose to human health, focus attention on areas in which knowledge remains inadequate and prompt a re-evaluation of the causative risk factors driving the current changes in obesity rates. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","complement; complement component C1; complement component C2; complement component C3; complement component C4; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; glycoprotein; multienzyme complex; properdin; thiol derivative; anaphylaxis; binding site; biological model; cell membrane; chemical structure; enzyme activation; human; metabolism; molecular weight; oxidation reduction reaction; protein conformation; review; solubility; Anaphylaxis; Binding Sites; Cell Membrane; Complement C1; Complement C2; Complement C3; Complement C4; Complement C5; Complement C6; Complement C7; Complement C8; Complement C9; Complement System Proteins; Enzyme Activation; Glycoproteins; Humans; Models, Biological; Models, Molecular; Molecular Weight; Multienzyme Complexes; Oxidation-Reduction; Properdin; Protein Conformation; Solubility; Sulfhydryl Compounds"

This trial randomized 811 individuals who were overweight or obese to one of four diets that contained either 15% or 25% protein and 20% or 40% fat in a 2 × 2 factorial design. A standard behavioral weight loss program was available for all participants who were followed for 2 years with an 80% completion rate. Recent Findings: Nineteen genes and five genetic risk scores were used along with demographic, behavioral, endocrine, and metabolic measurements. Genetic variations in most of the genes were associated with weight loss, but this association often varied with the dietary assignment. A number of demographic and behavioral factors, including attendance at behavioral sessions and food cravings were predictive of weight changes. A high baseline level of free triiodothyronine or free thyroxine predicted the magnitude of weight loss. Several perfluoroakyl compounds predicted more rapid weight regain. Summary: Genetic evidence from POUNDS Lost provides guidance toward selection of a personalized weight loss diet and improvement in metabolic profile.

Hereditary platelet function disorders (PFDs) are at least as prevalent in the general population as von Willebrand disease (VWD) although PFDs tend not be as well recognized or evaluated. Clinical mucous and skin bleeding in patients with PFDs is prototypic of primary hemostasis disorders, and the bleeding pattern is not distinguishable from that of other primary hemostasis disorders such as VWD. However, different treatment needs, between these discrete disorders, make a precise diagnosis mandatory. Currently, clinicians receive reliable laboratory reports when testing patients with severe PFDs, such as Glanzmann thrombasthenia and Bernard-Soulier syndrome, due to the distinctive laboratory defects that these disorders present, together with the availability of differential diagnostic tests. This is not the case for the majority of PFDs generically classified as ""platelet secretion disorders,"" which are a heterogeneous group of ""mild bleeding disorders,"" for which there are not universally accepted diagnostic criteria. An important reason for robust diagnostic tests is the high proportion (more than 50% in some reports) of patients with unequivocal bleeding who have no precise diagnosis established after a complete laboratory workup. It is paradoxical that the current ""gold standard"" test for PFD diagnosis, light transmission aggregometry (LTA), has not been standardized after more than four decades of worldwide clinical use. This review describes current diagnostic assays for PFD in a clinical hemostasis laboratory, relating these with current knowledge on platelet function and pathophysiology. Special emphasis will be given to LTA and platelet secretion tests, as well as to the reasons why sensitive tests are needed to explore the lesser known participation of platelets in blood clotting and fibrinolytic processes.

This is a highly specialized type of heme found as prosthetic group in cytochrome a-containing respiratory oxidases. Heme A differs structurally from heme B (protoheme IX) by the presence of a hydroxyethylfarnesyl group instead of a vinyl side group at the C2 position and a formyl group instead of a methyl side group at position C8 of the porphyrin macrocycle. Heme A synthase catalyzes the formation of the formyl side group and is a poorly understood heme-containing membrane bound atypical monooxygenase. This review presents our current understanding of heme A synthesis at the molecular level in mitochondria and aerobic bacteria.

Increasing evidence shows that plants are at a risk of being adversely affected by PFASs. This review concludes that PFASs are predominantly absorbed by roots from sources in the soil; besides, the review also discusses several factors such as soil properties and the species of PFASs and plants. In addition, following uptake by root, long-chain PFASs (C ≥ 7 for PFCA and C ≥ 6 for PFSA) were preferentially retained within the root, whereas the short-chain PFASs were distributed across tissues above the ground — according to the studies. The bioaccumulation potential of PFASs within various plant structures are further expressed by calculating bioaccumulation factor (BAF) across various plant species. The results show that PFASs have a wide range of BAF values within root tissue, followed by straw, and then grain. Furthermore, owing to its high water solubility than other PFASs, PFOA is the predominant compound accumulated in both the soil itself and within the plant tissues. Among different plant groups, the potential BAF values rank from highest to lowest as follows: leaf vegetables > root vegetables > flower vegetables > shoot vegetables. Several PFAS groups such as PFOA, PFBA, and PFOS, may have an increased public health risk based on the daily intake rate (ID). Finally, future research is suggested on the possible PFASs degradation occurring in plant tissues and the explanations at genetic-level for the metabolite changes that occur under PFASs stress. © 2022 The Author(s)",NA

This hypothesis is tested by comparing the levels of four selected perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) (i.e., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA)) in various global environmental media (i.e., rainwater, soils, and surface waters) with recently proposed guideline levels. On the basis of the four PFAAs considered, it is concluded that (1) levels of PFOA and PFOS in rainwater often greatly exceed US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Lifetime Drinking Water Health Advisory levels and the sum of the aforementioned four PFAAs (ς4 PFAS) in rainwater is often above Danish drinking water limit values also based on ς4 PFAS; (2) levels of PFOS in rainwater are often above Environmental Quality Standard for Inland European Union Surface Water; and (3) atmospheric deposition also leads to global soils being ubiquitously contaminated and to be often above proposed Dutch guideline values. It is, therefore, concluded that the global spread of these four PFAAs in the atmosphere has led to the planetary boundary for chemical pollution being exceeded. Levels of PFAAs in atmospheric deposition are especially poorly reversible because of the high persistence of PFAAs and their ability to continuously cycle in the hydrosphere, including on sea spray aerosols emitted from the oceans. Because of the poor reversibility of environmental exposure to PFAS and their associated effects, it is vitally important that PFAS uses and emissions are rapidly restricted. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Microcystins can be accumulated in various matrices in two forms: a free cellular fraction and a covalently protein-bound form. To detect and quantify the concentration of microcystins, a panel of techniques on various matrices (water, sediments, and animal tissues) is available. The analysis of MCs can concern the free or the total (free plus covalently bound) fractions. Free-form analyses of MCs are the most common and easiest to detect, whereas total-form analyses are much less frequent and more complex to achieve. The objective of this review is to summarize the different methods of extraction and analysis that have been developed for total forms. Four extraction methods were identified: MMPB (2-methyl-3-methoxy-4-phenylbutyric acid) method, deconjugation at basic pH, ozonolysis, and laser irradiation desorption. The study of the bibliography on the methods of extraction and analysis of the total forms of MCs showed that the reference method for the subject remains the MMPB method even if alternative methods and, in particular, deconjugation at basic pH, showed results encouraging the continuation of the methodological development on different matrices and on naturally-contaminated samples. © 2022 by the authors.","2 methyl 3 methoxy 4 phenylbutyric acid; 4 phenylbutyric acid; carboxen; chemical compound; cyanobacterium toxin; dimeticone; glutathione; mercaptoethanol; microcystin; permanganate potassium; trypsin; unclassified drug; microcystin; water; Ameiurus nebulosus; Coregonus clupeaformis; covalent bond; cyanobacterium; electron impact mass spectrometry; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; extracellular matrix; flame ionization detection; gas chromatography; high performance liquid chromatography; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liquid liquid extraction; Lymnaea stagnalis; mass fragmentography; mass spectrometry; Metacarcinus magister; Mugil cephalus; Mytilus edulis; nonhuman; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Osmerus mordax; ozonolysis; Perca flavescens; pH; Review; Salmo salar; Salvelinus fontinalis; size exclusion chromatography; solid phase extraction; solid phase microextraction; spectrofluorometry; tandem mass spectrometry; animal; water pollutant; Animals; Cyanobacteria; Cyanobacteria Toxins; Microcystins; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

NA,Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and their effects on the ovary,2020,NA,NA,"BACKGROUND: Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are found widespread in drinking water, foods, food packaging materials and other consumer products. Several PFAS have been identified as endocrine-disrupting chemicals based on their ability to interfere with normal reproductive function and hormonal signalling. Experimental models and epidemiologic studies suggest that PFAS exposures target the ovary and represent major risks for women's health. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: This review summarises human population and toxicological studies on the association between PFAS exposure and ovarian function. SEARCH METHODS: A comprehensive review was performed by searching PubMed. Search terms included an extensive list of PFAS and health terms ranging from general keywords (e.g. ovarian, reproductive, follicle, oocyte) to specific keywords (including menarche, menstrual cycle, menopause, primary ovarian insufficiency/premature ovarian failure, steroid hormones), based on the authors' knowledge of the topic and key terms. OUTCOMES: Clinical evidence demonstrates the presence of PFAS in follicular fluid and their ability to pass through the blood-follicle barrier. Although some studies found no evidence associating PFAS exposure with disruption in ovarian function, numerous epidemiologic studies, mostly with cross-sectional study designs, have identified associations of higher PFAS exposure with later menarche, irregular menstrual cycles, longer cycle length, earlier age of menopause and reduced levels of oestrogens and androgens. Adverse effects of PFAS on ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis have been confirmed in experimental models. Based on laboratory research findings, PFAS could diminish ovarian reserve and reduce endogenous hormone synthesis through activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, disrupting gap junction intercellular communication between oocyte and granulosa cells, inducing thyroid hormone deficiency, antagonising ovarian enzyme activities involved in ovarian steroidogenesis or inhibiting kisspeptin signalling in the hypothalamus. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The published literature supports associations between PFAS exposure and adverse reproductive outcomes; however, the evidence remains insufficient to infer a causal relationship between PFAS exposure and ovarian disorders. Thus, more research is warranted. PFAS are of significant concern because these chemicals are ubiquitous and persistent in the environment and in humans. Moreover, susceptible groups, such as foetuses and pregnant women, may be exposed to harmful combinations of chemicals that include PFAS. However, the role environmental exposures play in reproductive disorders has received little attention by the medical community. To better understand the potential risk of PFAS on human ovarian function, additional experimental studies using PFAS doses equivalent to the exposure levels found in the general human population and mixtures of compounds are required. Prospective investigations in human populations are also warranted to ensure the temporality of PFAS exposure and health endpoints and to minimise the possibility of reverse causality. © The Author(s) 2020.

Areas covered: PXR activities are implicated in drugdrug interactions and endocrine disruption. Recent evidence supports a hepatoprotective role for PXR in chronic liver injury, inhibiting liver inflammation through suppression of the NF-κB pathway. However, PXR-mediated induction of CYP3A enhances APAP-induced acute liver injury by generating toxic metabolites. While these observations implicate PXR as a therapeutic target for liver injury, they also caution against PXR activation by pharmaceutical drugs. Expert opinion: While evidence of PXR involvement in acute and chronic liver injuries identifies it as a possible therapeutic target, it raises additional concerns for all drug candidates. The in vitro and in vivo tests for human PXR activation should be incorporated into the FDA regulations for therapeutic drug approval to identify potential liver toxicities. In addition, PXR pharmacogenetic studies will facilitate the prediction of patient-specific drug reactivities and associated liver disorders. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.","1,4 bis(3,5 dichloro 2 pyridyloxy)benzene; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; cafestol; chlordane; clofibrate; clotrimazole; corticosterone; coumestrol; dieldrin; diethylstilbestrol; endosulfan; estradiol; flucloxacillin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; hyperforin; hypocholesterolemic agent; paclitaxel; paracetamol; perfluorodecanoic acid; phenobarbital; phytoestrogen; pregnane X receptor; rifampicin; sr 12813; tacrolimus; tetracycline; trabectedin; troglitazone; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; xenobiotic agent; acute liver failure; chronic liver disease; drug clearance; drug metabolism; drug targeting; endocrine disease; genetic polymorphism; hepatitis; human; in vitro study; liver injury; liver protection; nonhuman; pharmacogenetics; review; Animals; Humans; Liver; Liver Diseases; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Receptors, Steroid"

As with other environmental exposures, a major hurdle for gaining a better understanding of their human health impacts is the limited utility of cell culture and animal models serving as convenient, yet imperfect proxies to human physiology and disease.

Remediation of environmental PFAS contamination and their presence in consumer products have led to the production of solid and liquid waste streams containing high concentrations of PFASs, which require efficient and cost-effective treatment solutions. PFASs are challenging to defluorinate by conventional and advanced destructive treatment processes, and physical separation processes produce waste streams (e.g., membrane concentrate, spent activated carbon) requiring further post-treatment. Incineration and other thermal treatment processes are widely available, but their use in managing PFAS-containing wastes remains poorly understood. Under specific operating conditions, thermal treatment is expected to mineralize PFASs, but the degradation mechanisms and pathways are unknown. In this review, we critically evaluate the thermal decomposition mechanisms, pathways, and byproducts of PFASs that are crucial to the design and operation of thermal treatment processes. We highlight the analytical capabilities and challenges and identify research gaps which limit the current understanding of safely applying thermal treatment to destroy PFASs as a viable end-of-life treatment process. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

In this review, we discuss various approaches of MSCs transplantation for bone regeneration including scaffold and hydrogel constructs, genetic modifications and surface engineering of the cell membrane aimed to improve homing and increase cell viability, proliferation and differentiation. © 2020",adeno associated virus vector; adenovirus vector; alpha 1 antitrypsin; baculovirus vector; bone morphogenetic protein 2; bone morphogenetic protein 4; bone morphogenetic protein 6; bone morphogenetic protein 9; chemokine receptor CXCR4; collagen sponge; hyaluronic acid; hydrogel; interleukin 4; lentivirus vector; liposome; osteogenic protein 1; perfluorotributylamine; recombinant bone morphogenetic protein; recombinant bone morphogenetic protein 2; recombinant bone morphogenetic protein 6; retrovirus vector; transcription factor RUNX2; transcription factor Sox11; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; adipose derived stem cell; bone defect; bone density; bone development; bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell; bone regeneration; bone remodeling; cell differentiation; cell engineering; cell homing; cell proliferation; dental pulp stem cell; encapsulation; endothelium cell; ex vivo gene transfer; femur head necrosis; fracture healing; fracture nonunion; fragility fracture; genetic engineering; human; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; microcapsule; nonhuman; open fracture; osseointegration; osteoblast; ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis; priority journal; Review; skull defect; tibia fracture; animal; bone disease; chemistry; cytology; mesenchymal stem cell; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; procedures; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; Animals; Bone Diseases; Bone Regeneration; Humans; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Osteoblasts; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging contaminants with the characteristics of persistence and bioaccumulation. PFAS exposure can affect the function of the nervous, endocrine, and immune system of animals and humans. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the epidemiological studies investigating potential relationships between PFAS exposure and vaccine antibody levels, and assessed whether PFAS would affect vaccine response in healthy children. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases up to February 2022. We chose studies that measured serum vaccines antibodies and PFAS concentrations of the participants. Essential information, including mean difference of percentage change, regression coefficient, odds ratio, Spearman correlation coefficient, and 95% confidence intervals, were extracted from the selected studies to conduct descriptive analysis and meta-analysis where appropriate. The qualities of these studies were evaluated as well. Finally, nine epidemiological studies about children met our inclusion criteria. A high degree of heterogeneity is observed in terms of breastfeeding time, confounder control, and detection method. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level in children without heterogeneity by Cochran's Q test (p = 0.26; p = 0.55), and exposure to perfluorohexane sulfonate is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level but with heterogeneity (p = 0.04). This comprehensive review suggests that PFAS can have adverse health effects on children by hindering the production of vaccine antibodies. There are some consistent and negative associations between children exposure to certain PFAS and tetanus antibody level. The association of the other four vaccines (measles, rubella, mumps, and influenza) with PFAS remains uncertain, because very few studies are available. Further studies are needed to validate the possible associations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biochemistry; Quality control; Vaccines; Emerging contaminant; Environmental exposure; Epidemiological studies; Literature search; Meta-analysis; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Systematic Review; Vaccine antibody; Web of Science; Antibodies; antibody; diphtheria vaccine; influenza vaccine; measles vaccine; mumps vaccine; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; rubella vaccine; tetanus antibody; tetanus toxoid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; virus antibody; antibody; bioaccumulation; chemical pollutant; disease control; endocrine system; epidemiology; immune system; literature review; meta-analysis; model validation; pollution effect; vaccination; vaccine; antibody blood level; antibody production; bioaccumulation; breast feeding; confounding variable; correlation coefficient; drug response; environmental exposure; Haemophilus influenzae type b; human; influenza; measles; mumps; Review; rubella; systematic review; treatment outcome; epidemiology; meta analysis; pollutant; tetanus; toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Antibodies, Viral; Environmental Pollutants; Epidemiologic Studies; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Tetanus"

Moreover, due to their recalcitrant nature, these emerging contaminants are not effectively removed by existing conventional wastewater treatment technologies. In this regard, the present review focuses on the development of electrochemical oxidation (EO) as a sustainable and efficacious technology for the treatment of wastewater containing xenobiotics. The technology of EO works on the process of in-situ generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (OḢ), commonly via metallic cathode catalysts due to the application of electric current, which further oxidizes and is thus effective in eliminating pollutants such as xenobiotics from wastewater. This mini-review will aid in understanding the application of EO for the removal of xenobiotics from wastewater and different metal catalysts employed in EO for the production of hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, the critical factors affecting the performance of EO for xenobiotics removal have also been elucidated for enhancing the understanding of the readers in terms of scaling-up of an EO reactor. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Biochemistry; Catalysts; Electrochemical oxidation; Endocrine disrupters; Hydrogen production; Wastewater treatment; Critical factors; Emerging contaminant; Hydroxyl radicals; Metallic cathodes; Potential threats; Production of hydrogen; Wastewater treatment technologies; Xenobiotic compounds; Chemicals removal (water treatment); catalyst; drug; electrochemical method; hydroxyl radical; oxidation; toxicity; wastewater treatment; xenobiotics

This review summarizes the available data regarding the toxic effects of OUVFs on marine and freshwater organisms and generates the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) values necessary for assessing ecological risk. Through a systematic search of the literature, 89 studies were identified and ecotoxicological data extracted. Collectively, these studies described toxicity testing with 39 OUVF from 10 structural classes, with derivatives of benzophenones (49%) and camphors (16%) most studied. There was a bias towards selecting freshwater species (61%), and evaluating single OUVF effects (87%) rather than OUVF mixtures. Short-term (acute) experimentation (58%) was marginally more common than long-term (chronic) testing (42%). Reproductive, developmental, genetic, and neurological toxicity were the most commonly identified effects in aquatic organism, and were associated with molecular interactions with steroid receptors, DNA, or the production of reactive oxygen species. Species sensitivity distribution and/or assessment factors were used to calculate PNECs for 22 OUVFs and the risk quotients for 12 OUVFs. When using maximum concentrations, high risk was observed for six OUVFs in marine environments (4-methylbenzylidene-camphor, octocrylene, padimate-O, benzophenone-1, and oxybenzone, ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate), and for four OUVFs in freshwater environments (ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, avobenzone and oxybenzone). When using median concentrations, a risk to marine environments was observed for oxybenzone.

After passing the ganglion stellatum and neighbouring ganglia, the nerves enter the dorsal horn of the spinal cord at C8-Th9 (especially Th2-Th6). Here the nerve synapses for the first time, mainly to neurons which run up to the thalamus contralaterally by the tractus spinothalamicus. Apart from atypically localised pain (jaw, head, neck), the nervus vagus is rarely involved in transmitting agina pectoris pain. There is no close relation between peripheral pain localisation and localisation of coronary stenosis or myocardial ischemia areas. The localisation of angina pectoris is decided by viscero-somatic summation (convergence-projection-theory). Almost all the ascending tracts of the tractus spinothalamicus with visceral inflow also receive inflow from somatic afferences, from skin areas of the dermatome from the same segment level, and especially from deep somatic structures such as muscle and ligaments (Head's zones). Additional reflex mechanisms, where the efferent part is probably sympathetic, explain transferred effects in the matching dermatome such as hypothermic skin zones, cutaneous hyperalgesia, higher pressure sensitivity of the muscles and occasionally even dystrophic changes. The amount of spinal visceral afferences is relatively small (only 1.5-2.5% of all somatic spinal afferences). The low amount, the pronounced divergence and, compared to converging somatic afferences, the larger receptive fields in the organ explain the diffuse, barely localisable character of angina pectoris pain. Cardiac afferences are tonically and phasically inhibited at spinal and supraspinal levels, especially by descending tracts. This explains why angina pectoris can be missing in spite of pronounced peripheral nociceptive impulse rates. Patients with silent myocardial ischemia have a higher central pain threshold than patients with symptomatic myocardial ischemia. Endogenous opioids are involved in the body's own analgesia system. The beta-endorphin level in the serum rises significantly in many patients during exercise diagnostic tests. Patients with silent myocardial ischemia have higher beta-endorphin levels compared to symptomatic patients at the same exercise level. This can be interpreted as expressing quantitative differences in a superior pain regulation system. Myocardial ischemia is experienced as angina pectoris pain when the peripheral nociceptive impulse rate is so pronounced that the prevailing inhibitory pain threshold can be overcome and when the pain pathways are intact.",beta endorphin; adult; aged; angina pectoris; female; human; ischemia; male; nociception; priority journal; review; sympathetic nerve; Angina Pectoris; Animal; English Abstract; Human; Nociceptors; Peripheral Nerves; Skin; Spinal Cord; Spinothalamic Tracts

NA,"Perfluorohexanoic acid toxicity, part II: Application of human health toxicity value for risk characterization",2019,NA,NA,"Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) is a short-chain, six-carbon PFAA and is a primary impurity, degradant, and metabolite associated with the short-chain fluorotelomer-based chemistry used in the United States, Europe and Japan today. With the shift towards short-chain PFAA chemistry, uncertainties remain regarding human health risks associated with current exposure levels. Here, we present a critical review and assessment of data relevant to human health risk assessment to today's short-chain PFAA chemistry. Human biomonitoring surveys indicate that PFHxA is infrequently detected in the environment as well as in human serum and urine; however, human health concerns may persist in locations where PFHxA is detected. In a companion paper (Luz et al., 2019) we comprehensively evaluate the available toxicity data for PFHxA, and derive a chronic human health-based reference dose (RfD) for PFHxA of 0.25 mg/kg-day based on benchmark dose modeling of renal papillary necrosis in chronically exposed female rats. In this paper, we apply this RfD in human health-based screening levels calculations, and derive a drinking water lifetime health advisory of 1400 μg/L and a residential groundwater screening level for children of 4000 μg/L. Compared to environmental concentration data, even sites with more elevated concentrations of PFHxA in the environment are at least an order of magnitude lower than these screening levels. Available PFHxA human serum and urine biomonitoring data, used as a biomarker for general population exposure, demonstrates that the general human population exposures to PFHxA are low. Previous estimates of daily intake rates for infants exposed to PFHxA through breast milk, formula, and baby foods (Lorenzo et al., 2016) combined with the most conservative PFHxA peer-reviewed toxicity value (Luz et al., 2019) demonstrate that the margin of safety for PFHxA is high. Therefore, PFHxA and related fluorotelomer precursors currently appear to present negligible human health risk to the general population and are not likely to drive or substantially contribute to risk at sites contaminated with PFAS mixtures. PFHxA may also represent a suitable marker for the safety of fluorotelomer replacement chemistry used today. © 2019",NA
NA,In utero exposure to persistent and nonpersistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals and anogenital distance. A systematic review of epidemiological studies,2020,NA,NA,"Anti-androgenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can cross the placenta to modify early offspring sexual dimorphic markers. These changes are linked to anogenital distance (AGD), which is an androgen-sensitive anthropometric parameter used as a biomarker of perineal growth and caudal migration of the genital tubercle. This review aimed to summarize strength of evidence for associations of in utero exposure to EDCs with AGD and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature so as to inform future research. We performed an electronic search of English literature in September 2019 in medical literature analysis and retrieval system online (MEDLINE), Web of Science and Toxline. We included epidemiological studies that examined in utero exposure to persistent and nonpersistent EDCs and considered AGD in offspring as an outcome. Our review contained 16 investigations examining exposure to persistent EDCs (nine studies) and nonpersistent EDCs (seven studies). Some individual studies reported an inverse association between exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), dioxins, perfluoroalkyl substances, and organochlorides and AGD in both male and female offspring. Meta-analysis of three studies found a small reduction of AGD in female offspring exposed to BPA. The number of studies per chemical is small, and number of subjects examined is limited; so, replication of these results is needed. To achieve more specificity and better replication of results, future studies should establish the association of nonpersistent EDCs using multiple urine samples, evaluate the cumulative impact of exposure to a mixture of anti-androgenic chemicals, and offer adequate consideration of more maternal- and children-related confounding factors. © 2019 The Author(s).

Emerging pollutants typically occur in low concentrations and are not removed by conventional DWT processes. Emerging DBPs appear within the DWT or in the distribution system due to the combination of disinfection agents (especially chlorine) with precursors as: natural organic matter (NOM), algal organic matter (AOM), anthropogenic contaminants (pesticides, pharmaceuticals, detergents etc.), brominated and iodinated compounds. This study has as main goal a consistent analysis of the major problems caused by emerging DBPs to drinking water supplies. It presents a comprehensive review of the research efforts related to emerging DBPs considering three viewpoints: 1. an overview of their classification, legislative framework, methods of analysis, disinfection operational conditions and removal processes; 2. their occurrence, fate, health effects and impacts; 3. the analysis of the advanced DWT processes that might be used for the removal and control of precursors and DBPs, with a focus on pilot and full-scale installations. All presented case studies considered pollutants removed, process conditions and efficiencies, and a critical assessment of processes based on membranes, advanced oxidation and adsorption on activated carbon or other materials. The main challenges of the control and removal of emerging DBPs are their low concentrations and the technical and economic sustainability of their application at full-scale, which need to be carefully adapted to local boundary conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Activated carbon; Biogeochemistry; Discrete wavelet transforms; Disinfection; Membranes; Organic compounds; Pollution; Potable water; Soaps (detergents); Water supply; Anthropogenic contaminants; Disinfection by-product; Disinfection byproducts; Drinking water treatment process; Economic sustainability; Legislative frameworks; Natural organic matters; Operational conditions; Activated carbon treatment; activated carbon; bromine derivative; chlorine; chlorine dioxide; detergent; drinking water; iodine derivative; iron derivative; natural organic matter; organic matter; ozone; pesticide; activated carbon; byproduct; disinfection; drinking water; installation; iodine; operations technology; organic matter; pollutant removal; water treatment; adsorption; amination; disinfection; environmental impact; health impact assessment; oxidation; Review; water pollutant; water treatment; algae

Furthermore, HTC offers several advantages over conventional dry-thermal pre-treatments, as no prior drying is requested, and the high quality of the char produced promotes applications as energy production and storage, wastewater remediation, and soil amendment. Relationships between char yields, physicochemical properties and process parameters are here analysed, with the aim to provide insight into the choice of the process severity required to fit the desired application. Moreover, presence and fate of heavy metals and organic contaminants are discussed. The highest reaction temperature is the main parameter affecting the physicochemical characteristics of the char produced, while the heating rate governs the heat mass transfer and the rate of intermediates formation. Depolymerization of the biomass results in a reduction of the oxygen to carbon ratio and, therefore, in augmented high heating values, further increased by deposition of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural. Recirculation of process water may enhance dehydration reactions and the deposition of degraded polymers, increasing dewaterability and yield, but field trials are recommended to assess the feasibility of this option. An overuse of chars for energy generation purposes would be deleterious for the environmental life cycle.

While current Smart Cities are often inaccessible, the experience of everyday citizens may be enhanced with a combination of the emerging technologies Digital Twins (DTs) and Situated Analytics. DTs represent their Physical Twin (PT) in the real world via models, simula-tions, (remotely) sensed data, context awareness, and interactions. However, interaction requires appropriate interfaces to address the complexity of the city. Ultimately, leveraging the potential of Smart Cities requires going beyond assembling the DT to be comprehensive and accessible. Situated Analytics allows for the anchoring of city information in its spatial context. We advance the concept of embedding the DT into the PT through Situated Analytics to form Fused Twins (FTs). This fusion allows access to data in the location that it is generated in in an embodied context that can make the data more understandable. Prototypes of FTs are rapidly emerging from different domains, but Smart Cities represent the context with the most potential for FTs in the future. This paper reviews DTs, Situated Analytics, and Smart Cities as the foundations of FTs. Regarding DTs, we define five components (physical, data, analytical, virtual, and Connection Environments) that we relate to several cognates (i.e., similar but different terms) from existing literature. Regarding Situated Analytics, we review the effects of user embodiment on cognition and cognitive load. Finally, we classify existing partial examples of FTs from the literature and address their construction from Augmented Reality, Geographic Information Systems, Building/City Information Models, and DTs and provide an overview of future directions. © 2022 by the authors.

The search for cost-effective and environmental-friendly bio-jet fuels derived from natural resources is gaining momentum. The microalgae cultivation conditions including temperature, pH, light intensity and nutrients have shown significant influence on the microalgae growth rate and chemical composition, which create the opportunities to enhance the yield and quality of microalgae bio-jet fuel. This review is focused on the hydroprocessing method for converting microalgae oil into bio-jet fuel, as well as the novel conceptual approaches for bio-jet fuel production such as gasification with Fischer-Tropsch and sugar-to-jet. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of biomass is one of the best alternative ways to replace natural aviation fuel due to the high maximum energy efficiency and low emission of greenhouse gas. In addition, hydroprocessing with the aid of Ni and zeolites catalysts has successfully converted the microalgae biodiesel to bio-jet fuel with high yield and alkane selectivity. Among these techniques, hydroprocessing used the lowest production cost with the longest duration, whereas the bio-jet fuel with high selectivity (C8–C16) could be produced by using gasification with the Fischer-Tropsch process. Consequently, gasification and Fischer-Tropsch and sugar-to-jet can become the future alternative process to convert microalgae to bio-jet fuel. The development of microalgae bio-jet fuel will increase the security of energy supply and reduce the fuel expenses in aviation industry. © 2021",Biofuels; Biomass; Catalyst selectivity; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Gasification; Greenhouse gases; Microalgae; Microorganisms; Productivity; Aviation energy; Aviation sector; Bio-jet fuel; Bio-mass energy; Energy; Fischer Tropsch; Fuel production; Gasification fischer-topsch; Hydroprocessing; Micro-algae; Jet fuel

Inflammation is central to the process of neuronal death, yet the roles of the complement cascade in this process have proven to be complex and hard to unravel. The complement cascade is involved in triggering cell death and recruiting cells of the immune system to sites of inflammation, including the brain. However, complement might also have important neuroprotective roles that are only now coming to light. Recent evidence suggests that targeted activation of complement might be a potential approach for treatment of stroke and other acute neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review these novel neuroprotective roles of the complement cascade, focusing on signaling pathways that might provide new therapeutic targets in acute neuronal injury. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Slaughterhouse wastewater (SWW) contains proteins, fats, high organic contents, microbes, and other emerging pollutants (pharmaceutical and veterinary residues). It is important to first characterize the wastewater so that adequate treatment techniques can be employed so that discharge of this wastewater does not negatively impact the environment. Conventional characterization bulk parameters of slaughterhouse wastewater include pH, color, turbidity, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and coliform counts. Characterization studies conducted have revealed the effects of the pollutants on microbial activity of SWW through identification of toxicity of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Due to the high-strength characteristics and complex recalcitrant pollutants, treatment techniques through combined processes such as anaerobic digestion coupled with advanced oxidation process were found to be more effective than stand-alone methods. Hence, there is need to explore and evaluate innovative treatments and techniques to provide a comprehensive summary of processes that can reduce the toxicity of slaughterhouse wastewater to the environment. This work presents a review of recent studies on the characterization of SWW, innovative treatments and technologies, and critical assessment for future research. © 2022 by the authors.

Organic contaminants are characterized by a variety of physical and chemical properties, including aggregation phase, concentration level, and life time. This variety widens the spectrum of procedures developed to assess their occurrence in the environment and biota, but prevents the complete speciation of the ""organic fraction"" of air, waters and particulates, and attention is paid to a few substances. The progress in health sciences stimulates the concern on contaminants and the development of new instrumental apparatuses and methods; new chemicals are continuously identified or recognized as capable of injuring the environment and organisms. Persistent organic pollutants and persistent biologically active toxicants are subject to regulation and extensively measured by means of standard procedures. For instance, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorobiphenyls and polychlorodibenzodioxins are recovered from air through phase partition, thermal desorption or solvent extraction, then separated and detected through GC-MS or HPLC-MS procedures. By contrast, dedicated methods must be still optimized to monitor candidates or possible candidates as emerging organic pollutants, e. g. phthalates, flame retardants and perfluoroalkanes. Also, psychotropic substances appear of potential concern. Legal and illicit substances are commonly detected in the urban air besides waste and surface waters. If nicotine, caffeine and cocaine will result to enough persistence in the air, their monitoring will become an important issue of global chemical watching in the next future. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","phthalic acid derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; psychotropic agent; air sampling; analytical method; atmospheric pollution; desorption; environmental assessment; environmental impact; literature review; organic pollutant; PAH; persistence; phthalate; physicochemical property; pollution monitoring; speciation (chemistry); air pollutant; atmosphere; environmental monitoring; Italy; methodology; review; Air Pollutants; Atmosphere; Environmental Monitoring; Italy; Phthalic Acids; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Psychotropic Drugs; Italy"

PFOS is an environmentally persistent compound used as a surfactant and occurs as a degradation product of both perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride and substituted perfluorooctane sulfonamido components found in many commercial and consumer applications. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were given 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg PFOS daily by gavage from gestational day (GD) 2 to GD 20; CD-1 mice were similarly treated with 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg PFOS from GD 1 to GD 17. Controls received 0.5% Tween-20 vehicle (1 ml/kg for rats and 10 ml/kg for mice). Maternal weight gain, food and water consumption, and serum chemistry were monitored. Rats were euthanized on GD 21 and mice on GD 18. PFOS levels in maternal serum and in maternal and fetal livers were determined. Maternal weight gains in both species were suppressed by PFOS in a dose-dependent manner, likely attributed to reduced food and water intake. Serum PFOS levels increased with dosage, and liver levels were approximately fourfold higher than serum. Serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the PFOS-treated rat dams were significantly reduced as early as one week after chemical exposure, although no feedback response of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was observed. A similar pattern of reduction in T4 was also seen in the pregnant mice. Maternal serum triglycerides were significantly reduced, particularly in the high-dose groups, although cholesterol levels were not affected. In the mouse dams, PFOS produced a marked enlargement of the liver at 10 mg/kg and higher dosages. In the rat fetuses, PFOS was detected in the liver but at levels nearly half of those in the maternal counterparts, regardless of administered doses. In both rodent species, PFOS did not alter the numbers of implantations or live fetuses at term, although small deficits in fetal weight were noted in the rat. A host of birth defects, including cleft palate, anasarca, ventricular septal defect, and enlargement of the right atrium, were seen in both rats and mice, primarily in the 10 and 20 mg/kg dosage groups, respectively.

Visible-light-mediated photoredox catalysis also offers exciting opportunities to achieve challenging carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond formations with excellent chemo-, regio-, or stereoselectivity under mild and ecologically benign conditions. The greater part of photoredox reactions depends on heavy metals like ruthenium(ii) or iridium(iii) based complexes as photoredox catalysts owing to their strong absorption, long-lived excited-state lifetimes and high oxidation or redox potentials. However, these transition metal complexes are expensive and pose severe drawbacks with respect to large scale application and sustainability. Organic dyes are also commonly used as a low-cost alternative to Ru- or Ir-based complexes. However, they have inferior photostability. Thus, further development of alternative photocatalysts based on copper salts or copper complexes is widely investigated because of their economic and environmental benefits. In recent years, visible-light-mediated direct functionalization of olefins or alkynes to afford a diverse range of organic compounds has received extensive interest from synthetic chemists due to their easy availability and reactivity towards a large number of reactants.

With over 9000 compounds belonging to this chemical class, there is increasing concern regarding human exposure to these compounds due to their persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic nature. Human exposure to PFAS may occur from a variety of exposure sources, including, air, food, indoor dust, soil, water, from the transfer of PFAS from non-stick wrappers to food, use of cosmetics, and other personal care products. This critical review presents recent research on the health-related impacts of PFAS exposure, highlighting compounds other than Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and Perfluoroctane sulfonate (PFOS) that cause adverse health effects, updates the current state of knowledge on PFAS toxicity, and, where possible, elucidates cause-and-effect relationships. Recent reviews identified that exposure to PFAS was associated with adverse health impacts on female and male fertility, metabolism in pregnancy, endocrine function including pancreatic dysfunction and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, lipid metabolism and risk of childhood adiposity, hepatic and renal function, immune function, cardiovascular health (atherosclerosis), bone health including risk for dental cavities, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deficiency, neurological function, and risk of developing breast cancer. However, while cause-and-effect relationships for many of these outcomes were not able to be clearly elucidated, it was identified that 1) the evidence derived from both animal models and humans suggested that PFAS may exert harmful impacts on both animals and humans, however extrapolating data from animal to human studies was complicated due to differences in exposure/elimination kinetics, 2) PFAS precursor kinetics and toxicity mechanism data are still limited despite ongoing exposures, and 3) studies in humans, which provide contrasting results require further investigation of the long-term-exposed population to better evaluate the biological toxicity of chronic exposure to PFAS. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","perfluoroctane sulfonate; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; chemical substance; comparative study; health impact; knowledge; lipid; metabolism; reaction kinetics; toxicity; acute toxicity; adverse event; bioaccumulation; bone disease; breast cancer; cardiovascular effect; carotid atherosclerosis; childhood; clinical evaluation; comparative study; cytotoxicity; disease association; endocrine function; female fertility; health status; human; immune response; immunotoxicity; kidney dysfunction; kidney function; lipid metabolism; liver dysfunction; liver function; locomotion; long term exposure; male fertility; metabolic regulation; neurologic disease; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; osteoporosis; oxidative stress; pancreas disease; population; pregnancy; reproductive toxicity; respiratory function; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; thyroid function; tooth disease; vitamin D deficiency; animal; dust; female; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Caprylates; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dust; Female; Fluorocarbons; Male; Pregnancy"

In recent years, cinnamon (one of the most widely used spices) has attracted attention from researchers as a natural product with numerous health benefits for poultry. The essential oils in cinnamon, in particular, are of interest because of their antioxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and hypocholesterolaemic effects, in addition to their ability to stimulate digestive enzymes in the gut. This review mainly emphasizes the potential impact of cinnamon as a natural feed additive on overall gut health, nutrient digestibility, blood biochemical profile, gene expression, gut microbiota and immune response. © 2021 by the authors.

Temporal trend studies on water, sediments, bird, fish, marine mammal and the human show that the exposure of PFAS has significantly increased over the last 20–30 years. Different physical, biological and chemical treatment processes have been investigated for PFAS removal from water. However, there is a lack of detailed understating of the mechanism of removal by different methods, especially by different advanced chemical treatment processes. This article reviews PFASs removal efficacy and mechanism by the advanced chemical treatment methods from aqueous solution. Review shows that several advanced oxidation processes (e.g., electrochemical oxidation, activated persulfate oxidation, photocatalysis, UV-induced oxidation) are successful in degrading PFASs. Moreover, defluorination treatment, some thermal and non-thermal degradation processes are also found to be prominent for the degradation of PFASs with some limitations including process costs over physical treatment (e.g., sorption), production of toxic by-products and greenhouse gases. Finally, knowledge gaps concerning the advanced chemical treatment of PFASs are discussed. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Adsorption; Degradation; Electrochemical oxidation; Greenhouse gases; Health risks; Mammals; Photocatalysis; Reduction; Activated persulfate; Advanced oxidation; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Chemical treatment method; Chemical treatments; Degradation process; Natural environments; PFAS; Wastewater treatment

Methods: We searched several medical literature data bases with the following key words: ""oral allergy syndrome,"" ""OAS,"" ""pollen-food allergy syndrome,"" ""PFAS,"" ""allergy,"" ""diagnosis,"" ""treatment."" Results: Oral allergy syndrome (OAS), also called ""pollen-food allergy syndrome,"" is a type of food allergy brought about by flavors, nuts, raw fruit, and vegetables. The most well-known symptoms are mouth and throat itching, which starts rapidly after a food is placed in the mouth, and that, as a rule, continues for just a couple of minutes after the food has been swallowed. The frequency of OAS with pollen allergy has been reported as 5-8%; 1-2% of patients with OAS with pollen allergy show extreme responses, e.g., anaphylaxis. Birch tree pollen, ragweed pollen, and grass pollen hypersensitivity cause the symptoms. The diagnosis of OAS is confirmed by a positive history and positive skin-prick test result triggered by the food's fresh extract. Oral challenge result is normally positive with the raw food and negative with the similar cooked food. Conclusion: Patients with grass allergy may have a response to peaches, oranges, celery, tomatoes, and melons. Patients with ragweed allergy may show OAS symptoms with melon, cucumber, banana, and zucchini. Physicians should be aware of OAS and know the appropriate treatment. © Copyright 2018, OceanSide Publications, Inc., U.S.A.","antihistaminic agent; corticosteroid; epinephrine; allergen; breath analysis; cross reaction; food allergy; grass pollen; human; lactose intolerance; nose obstruction; nutritional intolerance; oral allergy syndrome; pollen allergy; prick test; pruritus; ragweed pollen; Review; sneezing; systematic review; voice change; anaphylaxis; animal; birch; eating; food; food allergy; immunology; Poaceae; pollen; pollen allergy; ragweed; skin test; Allergens; Ambrosia; Anaphylaxis; Animals; Betula; Eating; Food; Food Hypersensitivity; Humans; Poaceae; Pollen; Pruritus; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal; Skin Tests"

Hence, the development of highly efficient methods for introducing fluoroalkyl groups is of primary importance. In recent years, the reactions based on fluoroalkyl radicals have been developed into competent methods for introducing fluoroalkyl groups. On the other hand, the synthesis of the chiral molecules containing fluoroalkyl groups has attracted considerable attentions. However, attributed to the high reactivity of the fluoroalkyl radicals, the control of the reaction selectivity is difficult. Particularly, so far there have been only limited reports on the enantiocontrol of the reaction in this regard and the corresponding review of the field still lacks. This review summarizes the research on the asymmetric synthesis based on fluoroalkyl radical reactions developed over the past 20 years. The review introduces the selectivities, scope and mechanism of various reactions. It is divided into three different parts according to the type of the reaction: (1) asymmetric fluoroalkylation of enol/enamine intermediate through fluoroalkyl radical, (2) asymmetric difunctionalization of olefin through fluoroalkyl radical, (3) stereoselective 1,2-shift of vinylboronate complexes through fluoroalkyl radical. © 2019 Chinese Chemical Society & SIOC, CAS.",NA
NA,Consumer Product Chemicals in Indoor Dust: A Quantitative Meta-analysis of U.S. Studies,2016,NA,NA,"Indoor dust is a reservoir for commercial consumer product chemicals, including many compounds with known or suspected health effects. However, most dust exposure studies measure few chemicals in small samples. We systematically searched the U.S. indoor dust literature on phthalates, replacement flame retardants (RFRs), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), synthetic fragrances, and environmental phenols and estimated pooled geometric means (GMs) and 95% confidence intervals for 45 chemicals measured in ≥3 data sets. In order to rank and contextualize these results, we used the pooled GMs to calculate residential intake from dust ingestion, inhalation, and dermal uptake from air, and then identified hazard traits from the Safer Consumer Products Candidate Chemical List. Our results indicate that U.S. indoor dust consistently contains chemicals from multiple classes. Phthalates occurred in the highest concentrations, followed by phenols, RFRs, fragrance, and PFASs. Several phthalates and RFRs had the highest residential intakes. We also found that many chemicals in dust share hazard traits such as reproductive and endocrine toxicity. We offer recommendations to maximize comparability of studies and advance indoor exposure science. This information is critical in shaping future exposure and health studies, especially related to cumulative exposures, and in providing evidence for intervention development and public policy. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",NA

They are the downstream target of various signaling pathways, and their up/down-regulation affects various physiological processes. PIM family comprises three isoforms, namely, PIM-1, PIM-2, and PIM-3, on alternative initiation of translation and they have different levels of expression in different types of cancers. Its structure shows a unique ATP-binding site in the hinge region which makes it unique among other kinases. Scope of review: PIM kinases are widely reported in hematological malignancies along with prostate and breast cancers. Currently, many drugs are used as inhibitors of PIM kinases. In this review, we highlighted the physiological significance of PIM kinases in the context of disease progression and therapeutic targeting. We comprehensively reviewed the PIM kinases in terms of their expression and regulation of different physiological roles. We further predicted functional partners of PIM kinases to elucidate their role in the cellular physiology of different cancer and mapped their interaction network. Major conclusions: A deeper mechanistic insight into the PIM signaling involved in regulating different cellular processes, including transcription, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, cell migration and senescence, is provided. Furthermore, structural features of PIM have been dissected to understand the mechanism of inhibition and subsequent implication of designed inhibitors towards therapeutic management of prostate, breast and other cancers. General significance: Being a potential drug target for cancer therapy, available drugs and PIM inhibitors at different stages of clinical trials are discussed in detail. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","ABC transporter subfamily B; abemaciclib; androgen receptor; apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1; basic helix loop helix leucine zipper transcription factor; beta catenin; BH3 protein; breast cancer resistance protein; capivasertib; casein kinase II; CD135 antigen; chemokine receptor CXCR4; choline kinase; cyclin dependent kinase 2; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; cytokine; epidermal growth factor receptor 3; Flt3 ligand; gelatinase B; growth factor receptor bound protein 2; guadecitabine; heat shock protein 70; heat shock protein 90 alpha; heterochromatin protein 1; histone; homeobox protein Hox-A10; hormone; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 3; lymphoid enhancer factor 1; magnesium ion; mammalian target of rapamycin; Max protein; microRNA; mixed lineage leukemia protein; mouse double minute 2 homolog; multidrug resistance protein 1; octamer transcription factor 4; perfluorooctanoic acid; phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1; phosphoprotein; phosphotransferase inhibitor; positive transcription elongation factor b; proteasome; protein bcl 2; protein bcl xl; protein kinase Pim 1; protein p21; S phase kinase associated protein 2; S6 kinase; scatter factor; serine threonine protein kinase 3; short hairpin RNA; silmitasertib; STAT3 protein; STAT5 protein; STAT5a protein; STAT5b protein; stress activated protein kinase; stromal cell derived factor 1; suppressor of cytokine signaling 1; suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; T cell factor protein; transcription factor; transcription factor FKHR; troponin I; ubiquitin; uzansertib; vasculotropin; X linked inhibitor of apoptosis; antineoplastic agent; protein kinase inhibitor; protein kinase Pim 1; proto-oncogene proteins pim; acute myeloid leukemia; Akt/mTOR signaling; androgen deprivation therapy; angiogenesis; antiapoptotic activity; B cell lymphoma; bladder cancer; breast cancer; cancer immunotherapy; cancer therapy; Canis lupus; carcinogenesis; cardiac stem cell; catalysis; cell aging; cell cycle progression; cell cycle regulation; cell death; cell function; cell metabolism; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell regeneration; cell survival; cell transformation; cellular distribution; chromosome 6; chronic lymphatic leukemia; computer model; Coturnix japonica; crystallization; disease exacerbation; domestic cat; down regulation; Dromaius novaehollandiae; drug sensitivity; drug targeting; E box element; eel; epigenetics; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene duplication; gene expression; gene overexpression; genetic similarity; genetic transcription; genomic instability; hematologic malignancy; JAK-STAT signaling; lateral geniculate body; lung cancer; lymphatic leukemia; mantle cell lymphoma; marginal zone lymphoma; metastasis; microarray analysis; mRNA expression level; multiple myeloma; Mus musculus; NF kB signaling; nodal marginal zone lymphoma; nonhuman; oncogene c myc; oncogene src; pancreas cancer; pancreatic ductal carcinoma; phosphorylation; phylogenetic tree; proapoptotic activity; prospective study; prostate cancer; prostate hypertrophy; prostate tumor; protein degradation; protein motif; protein network; protein protein interaction; Review; senescence; sequence alignment; signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; stomach cancer; structural genomics; synergistic effect; systems pharmacology; therapeutic targeting; transcription regulation; triple negative breast cancer; tumor invasion; ubiquitination; xenograft; apoptosis; cell cycle; chemistry; drug effect; drug screening; human; metabolism; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Cycle; Cell Proliferation; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Humans; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1; Signal Transduction"

When entering the environment, MAs can interfere with the growth, development and reproduction of organisms, which has attracted extensive attention. However, there are few reviews on the occurrence characteristics, migration and transformation law, ecotoxicity and related removal technologies of MAs in the environment. In this work, combined with the existing relevant research, the migration and transformation law and ecotoxicity characteristics of MAs in the environment are summarized, and the removal mechanism of MAs is clarified. Currently, most studies on MAs are based on laboratory simulation experiments, and there are few studies on the migration and transformation mechanism between multiphase states. In addition, the cost of MAs removal technology is not satisfactory. Therefore, the following suggestions are put forward for the future research direction. The migration and transformation process of MAs between multiphase states (such as soil–water–sediment) should be focused on. Apart from exploring the new treatment technology of MAs, the upgrading and coupling of existing MAs removal technologies to meet emission standards and reduce costs should also be concerned.

Growing evidence from animal and human studies indicates that distinct time periods of heightened susceptibility to endocrine disruptors exist throughout the life course. The influence of environmental chemicals on breast cancer risk may be greater during several windows of susceptibility (WOS) in a woman's life, including prenatal development, puberty, pregnancy, and the menopausal transition. These time windows are considered as specific periods of susceptibility for breast cancer because significant structural and functional changes occur in the mammary gland, as well as alterations in the mammary micro-environment and hormone signaling that may influence risk. Breast cancer research focused on these breast cancer WOS will accelerate understanding of disease etiology and prevention. Main text: Despite the plausible heightened mechanistic influences of environmental chemicals on breast cancer risk during time periods of change in the mammary gland's structure and function, most human studies of environmental chemicals are not focused on specific WOS. This article reviews studies conducted over the past few decades that have specifically addressed the effect of environmental chemicals and metals on breast cancer risk during at least one of these WOS. In addition to summarizing the broader evidence-base specific to WOS, we include discussion of the NIH-funded Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Program (BCERP) which included population-based and basic science research focused on specific WOS to evaluate associations between breast cancer risk and particular classes of endocrine-disrupting chemicals - including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, perfluorinated compounds, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and phenols - and metals. We outline ways in which ongoing transdisciplinary BCERP projects incorporate animal research and human epidemiologic studies in close partnership with community organizations and communication scientists to identify research priorities and effectively translate evidence-based findings to the public and policy makers. Conclusions: An integrative model of breast cancer research is needed to determine the impact and mechanisms of action of endocrine disruptors at different WOS. By focusing on environmental chemical exposure during specific WOS, scientists and their community partners may identify when prevention efforts are likely to be most effective. © 2019 The Author(s).",metal; perfluoro compound; phenol derivative; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; birth weight; breast cancer; cancer growth; cancer prevention; cancer risk; cancer susceptibility; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; environmental exposure; health care policy; human; mammography; medical research; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; optical spectroscopy; postmenopause; pregnancy; prenatal period; Review; self report; sex differentiation; adverse event; animal; breast tumor; disease predisposition; environmental exposure; female; maternal exposure; menopause; puberty; research; risk factor; time factor; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Disease Susceptibility; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Menopause; Pregnancy; Puberty; Research; Risk Factors; Time Factors

However, short-chain PFASs re-main persistent, potentially toxic, and extremely mobile, posing potential threats to human health because of their widespread pollution and accumulation in the water cycle. This study systemati-cally summarized the removal effect, operation conditions, treating time, and removal mechanism of various low carbon treatment techniques for short-chain PFASs, involving adsorption, advanced oxidation, and other practices. By the comparison of applicability, pros, and cons, as well as bottle-necks and development trends, the most widely used and effective method was adsorption, which could eliminate short-chain PFASs with a broad range of concentrations and meet the low-carbon policy, although the adsorbent regeneration was undesirable. In addition, advanced oxidation techniques could degrade short-chain PFASs with low energy consumption but unsatisfied mineralization rates. Therefore, combined with the actual situation, it is urgent to enhance and upgrade the water treatment techniques to improve the treatment efficiency of short-chain PFASs, for providing a scientific basis for the effective treatment of PFASs pollution in water bodies globally. © 2022 by the authors.

In the present overview we will briefly describe the above-mentioned techniques with the aim of underlining potential hematological alternatives to gene doping for increasing aerobic capacity in sport. ©2008, Editrice Kurtis.",continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator; efaproxiral; fluorocarbon; hypoxia inducible factor 1; illicit drug; lactic acid; novel erythropoiesis stimulating protein; oxygen; polymerized hemoglobin; recombinant erythropoietin; aerobic capacity; aerobic metabolism; anaerobic metabolism; anemia; athlete; blood transfusion; blood viscosity; convulsion; doping; gene control; genetic transfection; headache; human; hypertension; leukoencephalopathy; muscle contraction; muscle cramp; muscle function; muscle tissue; myeloproliferative disorder; oxygen transport; physical performance; pure red cell anemia; respiratory tract infection; review; side effect; thrombocyte adhesion; thrombocyte count; thrombosis

Anthropogenic contaminants are mainly introduced via riverine discharge and atmospheric deposition. Regional and international measures have successfully been employed to reduce concentrations of several legacy contaminants. However, current Baltic Sea monitoring programs do not address compounds of emerging concern. Hence, potentially harmful pharmaceuticals, UV filters, polar pesticides, estrogenic compounds, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or naturally produced algal toxins are not taken into account during the assessment of the state of the Baltic Sea. Herein, we conducted literature searches based on systematic approaches and compiled reported data on these substances in Baltic Sea surface water and on methodological advances for sample processing and chemical as well as effect-based analysis of these analytically challenging marine pollutants. Finally, we provide recommendations for improvement of future contaminant and risk assessment in the Baltic Sea, which revolve around a combination of both chemical and effect-based analyses. © 2021, The Author(s).","pesticide; sea water; Baltic States; chemistry; environmental monitoring; sea; water pollutant; Baltic States; Environmental Monitoring; Oceans and Seas; Pesticides; Seawater; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

An extensive collection of PPCP data from the published literature was compiled to determine the occurrence, pathways, and the effectiveness of current treatment technologies for the removal of PPCPs in water and wastewater. Approximately 90% of the compiled published papers originated from Asia, Europe, and the North American regions. The incomplete removal of PPCPs in different water and wastewater treatment processes was widely reported, thus resulting in the occurrence of PPCP compounds in various environmental compartments. Caffeine, carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, triclosan, and triclocarban were among the most commonly reported compounds detected in water and solid matrices. Trace concentrations of PPCPs were also detected on plants and animal tissues, indicating the bioaccumulative properties of some PPCP compounds. A significant lack of studies regarding the presence of PPCPs in animal and plant samples was identified in the review. Furthermore, there were still knowledge gaps on the ecotoxicity, sub-lethal effects, and effective treatment processes for PPCPs. The knowledge gaps identified in this study can be used to devise a more effective research paradigm and guidelines for PPCP management. © 2021 by the authors.

The past decades have witnessed a boom in organofluorine chemistry and heterocyclic chemistry mainly owing to the importance of fluorine-containing heterocycles. As a result, the exploitation of readily available fluorinated building blocks to attach Rf groups to various heterocycles has become an important topic in synthetic chemistry. On the other hand, perfluoroalkyl halide, as a low-toxic and environmentally friendly perfluoroalkyl building block, has been extensively utilized as a unique reagent in the heterocycle construction. Considering the great influence and synthetic potential of these novel avenues, we summarize the recent advances for the synthesis of fluoroalkylated heterocycles by using perfluoroalkyl halides as key fluorine-containing building blocks. One or three C-X bonds of perfluoroalkyl halides are cleaved/functiona- lized during the perfluoroalkylation and cyclization process, and a series of perfluoroalkylated heterocycles such as quinoxalines, phenanthridines, hydrazones, thiazoles, pyrimidines, aza-tricycles, isoxazoles,etc. were synthesized in moderate to good yields. With a specific emphasis on their proposed mechanism, we hope this review will be useful for medicinal and synthetic organic chemists who are interested in radical-mediated perfluoroalkylation. © 2021 Chinese Chemical Society & SIOC, CAS.",NA

PFAS are a diverse set of chemicals that accumulate and transport quite differently in the environment depending on the length of their fluoroalkyl chains and their functional groups. This diversity in PFAS chemical characteristics combined with varying environmental factors also impact the bioaccumulation of these compounds in different organisms. In this review, we evaluate environmental factors (such as organic carbon, proteins, lipids, and dissolved cations) as well as PFAS characteristics (head group, chain-length, and concentration) that contribute to the significant variation seen in the literature of bioaccumulation metrics reported for organisms in aquatic ecosystems. Of the factors evaluated, it was found that PFAS concentration, dissolved organic matter, sediment organic matter, and biotransformation of precursor PFAS tended to significantly impact reported bioaccumulation metrics the most. Based on this review, it is highly suggested that future studies provide sufficient details of important environmental factors, specific organism traits/ behavior, and PFAS concentrations/compounds when reporting on bioaccumulation metrics to further fill data gaps and improve our understanding of PFAS in aquatic ecosystems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic organisms; Bioaccumulation; Biogeochemistry; Organic carbon; Water; Biotransformation; Environmental factors; Environmental pollutions; Exposure pathways; Fresh Water; Geochemical factors; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Substance concentrations; Trophic transfer; Aquatic ecosystems; fluorocarbon; fresh water; bioaccumulation; ecosystem; water pollutant; Bioaccumulation; Ecosystem; Fluorocarbons; Fresh Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

In the last years, asymmetric domino reactions have widely benefited from this fast-growing field, as exemplified by the development of an explosive number of novel and powerful asymmetric organocatalytic domino processes, which allowed the easy construction of complex chiral molecular architectures from simple materials with high yields and very often remarkable enantioselectivities in a metal-free environment. Indeed, the possibility to join two or more organocatalytic reactions in one asymmetric domino process has become a challenging goal for chemists, due to several advantages from economical and environmental points of view, avoiding costly protecting groups and time-consuming purification procedures after each step, for example.

O. melastigma has several promising features for research, which include a short generation period (3-4 months), daily spawning, small size (3-4 cm), transparent embryos, sexual dimorphism, and ease of mass culture in the laboratory. There have been extensive transcriptome and genome studies on the marine medaka in the past decade. Such omics data can be useful in understanding the signal transduction pathways of small teleosts in response to environmental stressors. An omics-integrated approach in the study of the marine medaka is important for strengthening its role as a small fish model for marine environmental studies. In this review, we present current omics information about the marine medaka and discuss its potential applications in the study of various molecular pathways that can be targets of marine environmental stressors, such as chemical pollutants.

NA,The Association between ADHD and Environmental Chemicals—A Scoping Review,2022,NA,NA,"The role of environmental chemicals in the etiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been of interest in recent research. This scoping review aims to summarize known or possible associations between ADHD and environmental exposures to substances selected as priority chemicals of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU). Literature searches were performed in PubMed to identify relevant publications. Only meta-analyses and review articles were included, as they provide more extensive evidence compared to individual studies. The collected evidence indicated that lead (Pb), phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) are moderately to highly associated with ADHD. Limited evidence exists for an association between ADHD and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), flame retardants, mercury (Hg), and pesticides. The evidence of association between ADHD and cadmium (Cd) and per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) based on the identified reviews was low but justified further research. The methods of the individual studies included in the reviews and meta-analyses covered in the current paper varied considerably. Making precise conclusions in terms of the strength of evidence on association between certain chemicals and ADHD was not straightforward. More research is needed for stronger evidence of associations or the lack of an association between specific chemical exposures and ADHD. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",NA

Prenylated flavonoids have a more lipophilic structure, which leads to its high affinity to the cell membranes and enhancement of the biological activity, which includes cytotoxicity, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and estrogenic activities. However, it is reported that prenylation decreases the plasma absorption but increases the tissue accumulation. The presence of the prenyl or lavandulyl groups on C8 position of flavonoids plays an important role in the biological activity.

The HPTLC-CAMAG® consists of: 1) an HPTLC-Vario® development chamber for optimization of the mobile phases; 2) TLC Sampler III® automated sample applicators; 3) solid teflon migration chambers, i.e., horizontal tanks that enable separation to be carried out either in sandwich or in saturation mode; 4) a TLC Scanner 3® densitometer controlled by CATS 4® software; and 5) a Pentium MMX 233 MHz personal computer with an external backup unit. HPTLC quantitative and qualitative analysis has now reached a remarkably high level of development and performance. The samples (aqueous or non-aqueous solutions) that are to be processed are automatically applied by spraying (50-300 nl) in calibrated bands of a few mm (with up to 64 3-mm bands per 10 × 20 cm plate) on high-performance stationary phases and of wide technological diversity. The chromatogram is obtained in 10 min. and run over a migration pathway of 5-6 cm. The plates are read by absorption-reflection or fluorescence-reflection at an ad hoc wavelength (190-800 nm), then the peak areas which have been scanned are calculated by the trapezoid method. The calibration curves are generated by Michaelis-Menten non-linear regression, and validated by internal quality control. The analytical yield is high, i.e., up to 50 assays and 250 determinations per day. HPTLC analysis covers a wide functional range, and can be used in the following ways: 1) as a teaching tool for separative analysis and GLP; 2) it is an invaluable method for the optimization of mobile phases and for the determination of absorption spectra and absorption maxima, with a view to developing HPLC methods in complex matrices; 3) it provides major support for post-production quality control of prescribed hospital preparations of all types, e.g., those connected with parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy, synthetic narcotic analgesia; and it can also be used for dry dosage analysis; 4) it is useful in pharmaceutical assessment, e.g., in studies on the physico-chemical characteristics of various substances, such as their identity, purity, concentration, stability and compatibility, particularly with regard to generic products; 5) it can contribute to monitoring the safety of medical apparatus and equipment via the analysis of container-content interactions; 6) it provides a qualification system for personnel and procedures for within- and between-center validation of GMP. Setting up such an HPTLC quality control unit requires a basic investment of about 0.9 MF or 70,000 US dollars for a cost of no more than 10 F or 1.5 US dollars (including tax) per routine assay. After 18 months in operation and 16 500 assays, the HPTLC analysis unit has become one of the mainstays of the Gustave-Roussy QAP. © 2001 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.","densitometry; device; France; high performance thin layer chromatography; hospital pharmacy; Michaelis constant; nonlinear system; parenteral nutrition; quality control; review; spectral sensitivity; technology; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Chromatography, Thin Layer; Pharmacy Service, Hospital; Quality Control; Technology, Pharmaceutical"

It has the highest electronegativity of all elements. Fluoride is widely distributed in the environment, occurring in the air, soils, rocks, and water. Although fluoride is used industrially in a fluorine compound, the manufacture of ceramics, pesticides, aerosol propellants, refrigerants, glassware, and Teflon cookware, it is a generally unwanted byproduct of aluminium, fertilizer, and iron ore manufacture. The medicinal use of fluorides for the prevention of dental caries began in January 1945 when community water supplies in Grand Rapids, United States, were fluoridated to a level of 1 ppm as a dental caries prevention measure. However, water fluoridation remains a controversial public health measure. This paper reviews the human health effects of fluoride. The authors conclude that available evidence suggests that fluoride has a potential to cause major adverse human health problems, while having only a modest dental caries prevention effect. As part of efforts to reduce hazardous fluoride ingestion, the practice of artificial water fluoridation should be reconsidered globally, while industrial safety measures need to be tightened in order to reduce unethical discharge of fluoride compounds into the environment. Public health approaches for global dental caries reduction that do not involve systemic ingestion of fluoride are urgently needed. © 2014 Stephen Peckham and Niyi Awofeso.",fluorapatite; fluoride; drinking water; fluoride; bioethics; caries prevention; cognitive defect; cognitive development; dental caries; dental fluorosis; fluid intake; fluoridation; health care policy; human; hypothyroidism; intelligence quotient; meta analysis (topic); mouth hygiene; neurotoxicity; occupational safety; ossification; osteofluorosis; osteolysis; public health; review; water supply; chemistry; public health; Drinking Water; Fluoridation; Fluorides; Humans; Public Health

A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed for studies on PFAS and child health outcomes. We identified 64 studies for inclusion and performed risk of bias analysis on those studies. We determined that risk of bias across studies was low to moderate. Six categories of health outcomes emerged. These were: immunity/infection/asthma, cardio-metabolic, neurodevelopmental/attention, thyroid, renal, and puberty onset. While there are a limited number of studies for any one particular health outcome, there is evidence for positive associations between PFAS and dyslipidemia, immunity (including vaccine response and asthma), renal function, and age at menarche. One finding of note is that while PFASs are mixtures of multiple compounds few studies examine them as such, therefore the role of these compounds as complex mixtures remains largely unknown. © 2017 by the authors.

The work emphasizes molecular structure and intermolecular self-organization that typically determine transport and optical emission in π-conjugated oligomers and polymers. In this context, hydrostatic pressure through diamond anvil cells has proven to be an elegant tool to control structure and interactions without chemical intervention. This has been highlighted by high pressure optical spectroscopy whilst analogous x-ray diffraction experiments remain less frequent. By focusing on a class of blue-emitting π-conjugated polymers, polyfluorenes, this article reviews optical spectroscopic studies under hydrostatic pressure, addressing the impact of molecular and intermolecular interactions on optical excitations, electron-phonon interaction, and changes in backbone conformations. This picture is connected to the optical high pressure studies of other π-conjugated systems and emerging x-ray scattering experiments from polyfluorenes which provides a structure-property map of pressure-driven intra- and interchain interactions.

The FTS reaction has received many attentions due to a limited petroleum resource with an increased demand for using alternative carbon sources such as stranded gas or shale gas. Some proper synthetic methods of an effective FTS catalyst having a larger active metal surface area and a lower deactivation rate are the most important issues for a long-term operation. Therefore, some ordered mesoporous materials (OMM) have been widely investigated in the field of CO hydrogenation using some heterogeneous catalysts. The present brief review paper summarized the various preparation methods of the ordered mesoporous materials for the possible applications of FTS reaction with a lower deactivation rate and a higher catalytic performance. The applications of the ordered mesoporous cobalt oxides for FTS reaction are briefly introduced and the ways to improve a structural stability even under reductive CO hydrogenation conditions by using efficient pillaring materials as well as by preparing mixed metal oxides. A higher catalytic activity of the ordered mesoporous cobalt oxide was also verified in a multi-channel fixed-bed compact reactor having the intersected interlayers of micro-channel heat exchanger.

The objectives of this report are to present a short review illustrated by a case study, followed by recommendations for future stream flow augmentation projects. Despite the fact that wastewater discharge to streams is commonplace, a water agency pursuing stream flow augmentation with recycled water will face unique challenges. For example, recycled water typically contains trace amounts of organic wastewater-derived compounds (OWCs) for which the potential ecological risks must be balanced against the benefits of an augmentation project. Successful stream flow augmentation with recycled water requires that the lead agency clearly articulate a strong project rationale and identify key benefits. It must be assumed that the public will have some concerns about water quality. Public acceptance may be better if an augmentation project has co-benefits beyond maintaining stream ecosystems, such as improving water system supply and reliability (i.e. potable use offset). Regulatory or project-specific criteria (acceptable concentrations of priority OWCs) would enable assessment of ecosystem impacts and demonstration of practitioner compliance. Additional treatment (natural or engineered) of the recycled water may be considered. If it is not deemed necessary or feasible, existing recycled water quality may be adequate to achieve project goals depending on project rationale, site and water quality evaluation, and public acceptance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Additional treatment; Environmental reuse; PFOA; PFOS; Potential ecological risk; Project goals; Public acceptance; Recycled water; Recycled water quality; Stream ecosystems; Stream habitats; Trace amounts; Wastewater discharge; Water agencies; Water quality evaluation; Water system; Ecosystems; Image enhancement; Potable water; Regulatory compliance; Reviews; Stream flow; Water quality; Water supply; Water recycling; alkylphenolpolyethoxylate metabolite; arsenic; caffeine; dimethylnitrosamine; drinking water; drug; endocrine disruptor; ground water; haloacetic acid; n butylbenzenesulfonamide; n ethylperfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetate; organic compound; organic wastewater derived compound; oxadiazon; perfluoro compound; perfluorodecanesulfonate; perfluorodecanoate; perfluoroheptanoate; perfluorohexanesulfonate; perfluorononoate; perfluorooctanesulfonamide; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; recycled water; trihalomethane; tris(2,3 dichloropropyl)phosphate; tris(3 chloropropyl)phosphate; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; water; organic compound; recycling; streamflow; wastewater; water management; water quality; water treatment; benthos; dechlorination; ecotoxicity; environmental health; environmental impact; environmental planning; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; government regulation; motivation; nonhuman; priority journal; reliability; review; risk; sewage disposal; sewer outfall; stream (river); stream flow augmentation; urban area; waste water management; waste water recycling; waste water treatment plant; water analysis; water contamination; water quality; water supply; water temperature; California; Conservation of Natural Resources; Organic Chemicals; Recycling; Rivers; Waste Water; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

We report here identification of 32 CSIs in widely distributed proteins such as RpoB, RpoC, UvrD, GyrA, PolA, PolC, MraW, NadD, PyrE, RpsA, RpsH, FtsA, RadA, etc., including a large [300 aa insert within the RpoC protein, that are present in various Synergistetes species, but except for isolated bacteria, these CSIs are not found in the protein homologues from any other organisms. These CSIs provide novel molecular markers that distinguish the species of the phylum Synergistetes from all other bacteria. The large numbers of other CSIs discovered in this work provide valuable information that supports and consolidates evolutionary relationships amongst the sequenced Synergistetes species. Of these CSIs, seven are specifically present in Jonquetella, Pyramidobacter and Dethiosulfovibrio species indicating a cladal relationship among them, which is also strongly supported by phylogenetic trees. A further 15 CSIs that are only present in Jonquetella and Pyramidobacter indicate a close association between these two species. Additionally, a previously described phylogenetic relationship between the Aminomonas and Thermanaerovibrio species was also supported by 9 CSIs. The strong relationships indicated by the indel analysis provide incentives for the grouping of species from these clades into higher taxonomic groups such as families or orders. The identified molecular markers, due to their specificity for Synergistetes and presence in highly conserved regions of important proteins suggest novel targets for evolutionary, genetic and biochemical studies on these bacteria as well as for the identification of additional species belonging to this phylum in different environments. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.","amino acid; bacterial protein; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing) A; molecular marker; protein FtsA; protein MraW; protein NadD; protein PolA; protein PolC; protein PyrE; protein RadA; protein RpoC; protein RpsA; protein RpsH; protein UvrD; RNA polymerase beta subunit; unclassified drug; bacterial DNA; amino acid sequence; bacterial genome; bacterial metabolism; bacterium identification; cladistics; Dethiosulfovibrio; fermentation; genetic association; genetic conservation; Gram negative bacterium; indel mutation; Jonquetella; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogenetic tree; phylum; priority journal; Pyramidobacter; review; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; Synergistetes; bacterial genome; bacterium; biology; classification; DNA fingerprinting; genetic marker; genetics; methodology; phylogeny; Aminomonas; Dethiosulfovibrio; Negibacteria; Thermanaerovibrio; Bacteria; Computational Biology; DNA Fingerprinting; DNA, Bacterial; Genetic Markers; Genome, Bacterial; INDEL Mutation; Phylogeny"

These include a variety of subtypes including partial facet joint resection, complete facet joint resection, opening wedge osteotomy (OWO), and closing wedge osteotomy (CWO). The partial facet joint resection provides limited lordosis but can be applied across multiple levels and provides bony surface for fusion. Complete facet joint resection can also be performed across multiple segments for a cumulative effect and like the partial facet joint resection requires mobility of the anterior column. The OWO is traditionally performed at C7 and involves complete a complete laminectomy, facetectomy, and pediculectomy with special care to fully decompress the C8 nerve roots prior to osteotomy closure. The osteotomy utilizes a fulcrum of rotation in the middle column with shortening of the posterior column and lengthening of the anterior column with an osteoclastic fracture that must be performed with significant care. The CWO is similar to an OWO with the addition of an osteotomy into the vertebral body that is closed like a pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO). The goal of this review article is to summarize posterior osteotomy techniques for cervical deformity correction. © 2020, AME Publishing Company. All rights reserved.",NA

An octanoyl moiety is transferred from the octanoyl-ACP of fatty acid synthetase to a specific lysine residue of the cognate protein followed by sulfur insertion at C6 and C8 of the octanoyl chain. The challenging chemistry of this last step is performed by the radical Sadenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme lipoyl synthase (LipA). In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Harmer et al. report the first crystal structure of a lipoyl synthase and demonstrate that it contains two [4Fe-4S] clusters, the canonical radical SAM cluster plus a second auxiliary cluster having an unprecedented serine ligand.

Such generation systems allow for significant reduction of CO2 emissions compared with a traditional fossil fuel plant. Furthermore, several improvements in power systems network configuration and operation combined with new technologies have enabled reduction of losses and energy demand, thus contributing to reduction of CO2 emissions. Another environmental threat identified in electrical networks is the leaking of insulating sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas used in electrical gas insulated substations (GIS) and equipment. Because of its Global Warming Potential (GWP) of nearly 24,000 and its long life in the atmosphere (over 3000 years), SF6 gas was recognized as a greenhouse gas at the 1997 COP3; since then its use and emissions in the atmosphere have been regulated by international treaties. It is expected that as soon as an alternative insulating gas is found, SF6 use in high-voltage (HV) equipment will be banned. This paper presents an overview of the key research advances made in recent years in the quest to find eco-friendly gases to replace SF6. The review reports the main properties of candidate gases that are being investigated; in particular, natural gases (dry air, N2 or CO2) and polyfluorinated gases especially Trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I), Perfluorinated Ketones, Octafluorotetra-hydrofuran, Hydrofluoroolefin (HFOs), and Fluoronitriles are presented and their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with an emphasis on their dielectric properties (especially their dielectric strength), GWP, and boiling point with respect to the minimum operating temperature for HV power network applications. © 2017 by the authors.",Carbon dioxide; Dielectric properties of gases; Electric network analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Environmental protection; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Gas mixtures; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Insulation; Ketones; Renewable energy resources; Sulfur hexafluoride; Dielectric strengths; Eco-friendly; Fluoronitriles; Global warming potential; Hydrofluoroolefin; Trifluoroiodomethane; SF6 insulation

Although actual increased incidence versus improved diagnosis remains controversial, the increased prevalence of ASD suggests non-inherited factors as likely contributors. There is increasing epidemiologic evidence that abnormal maternal thyroid function during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of child ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is known to disrupt thyroid function and can affect early brain development; thus, thyroid dysfunction is hypothesized to mediate this relationship. The concept of a potential pathway from prenatal PFAS exposure through thyroid dysfunction to ASD etiology is not new; however, the extant literature on this topic is scant.

Farnesyltransferase (FTase) and geranylgeranyl transferase I (GGTase I) are the prenyltransferases that catalyze the irreversible attachment of C15 farnesyl (Ras, Rnd) or C20 (R-Ras, Ral, Rap, Rho, Rac, Cdc42) isoprenoid lipid moieties to these small GTPases and other proteins. Therefore, pharmacological inhibitors of FTase (FTIs) and GGTase I (GGTIs) have been developed to prevent these modifications and thereby to block the lipid-mediated association of Ras and Rho proteins with cellular membranes and the consequent signaling and transforming activities. In addition, other small molecule inhibitors such as farnesyl thiosalicylic acid (FTS) can compete with the isoprenoid moiety of small GTPases for membrane binding sites. Finally, endogenous regulatory proteins such as RhoGDIs can bind to and mask the prenyl groups of small GTPases, leading to their sequestration from membranes.

The major subclass of HCAs found in the human diet comprise the amino-imidazoazaarenes (AIAs) 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP). All, except DiMeIQx, have been shown to be carcinogenic in animals. These compounds are present in cooked muscle meats at the p.p.b. level. Since the discovery of the HCAs in the late 1970s, many studies have examined the DNA adducts of these compounds. This review compiles the literature on AIA-DNA adducts including their identification and characterization, pathways of formation, mutagenesis in vitro and in vivo, and their association with carcinogenesis in animal models. It is now known that metabolic activation leading to the formation of DNA adducts is critical for mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of these compounds. All of the AIAs studied adduct to the guanine base, the major adduct being formed at the C8 position. Two AIAs, IQ and MeIQx, also form minor adducts at the NZ position of guanine. A growing body of literature has reported on the mutation spectra induced by AIA-guanine adducts. Studies of animal tumors induced by AIAs have begun to relate AIA-DNA adduct-induced mutagenic events with the mutations found in critical genes associated with oncogenesis. Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of chemoprevention of AIA tumorigenesis. Only a few studies have reported on the detection of AIA-DNA adducts in human tissues; difficulties persist in the routine detection of ALA-DNA adducts in humans for the purpose of biomonitoring of exposure to AIAs. The AIAs are nevertheless regarded as possible human carcinogens, and future research on AIA-DNA adducts is likely to help address the role of AIAs in human cancer.",guanine; heterocyclic amine; biological monitoring; carcinogenesis; chemoprophylaxis; DNA adduct; food processing; human; metabolic activation; mutagenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; review

This paper reviews past experiences with such disposal practices and highlights their unsustainability due to the risks of contamination of ecosystems, the food chain, together with ground and drinking water supplies. The use and associated disposal of POPs have been occurring for over 50 years. Concurrent with the phase-out of some of the most hazardous chemicals, the production of new POPs, such as brominated and fluorinated compounds has increased since the 1990s. These latter compounds are commonly used in a wide range of consumer goods, and as consumer products reach the end of their useful lives, ultimately enter waste recycling and disposal systems, in particular at municipal landfills. Because of their very slow, or lack of degradability, POPs will persist in landfills for many decades and possibly centuries. Over these extended time periods engineered landfill systems and their liners are likely to degrade, thus posing a contemporary and future risk of releasing large contaminant loads to the environment. This review highlights the necessity for alternative disposal methods for POP wastes, including destruction or complete removal from potential environmental release. In addition to such end of pipe solutions a policy change in the use pattern of persistent toxic chemicals is inevitable. In addition, inventories for the location and quantity of POPs in landfills, together with an assessment of their threat to ecosystems, drinking water and food resources are identified as key measures to facilitate appropriate management of risks. Finally the challenges of POP wastes in transition/developing countries, the risk of increased leaching of POPs from landfills due to climate change, and the possible negative impact of natural attenuation processes are considered. © The Author(s) 2011.",Brominated flame retardants; HCH; PBDE; PCB; PCDD/PCDFs; Persistent organic pollutants; PFOS; POPs; Stockholm; Chemical contamination; Climate change; Consumer products; Ecosystems; Fire fighting equipment; Flame retardants; Land fill; Leaching; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Potable water; Water supply; Waste disposal; bromine; diphenyl ether; drinking water; fluorine; ground water; hexachlorobenzene; pentachlorobenzene; pesticide; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; climate change; developing world; drinking water; food chain; HCH; landfill; leaching; literature review; natural attenuation; organic pollutant; PBDE; PCB; persistence; recycling; Stockholm Convention; toxic substance; waste disposal; biodegradability; climate change; contamination; destruction; developing country; ecosystem; environmental release; fluorination; food chain; landfill; leaching; policy; pollutant; priority journal; recycling; review; threat; waste disposal; water supply; dangerous goods; environmental monitoring; methodology; pollution; risk assessment; waste disposal; waste management; Developing Countries; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Food Chain; Hazardous Substances; Refuse Disposal; Risk Assessment; Waste Management; Water Supply

Its compounds, showing Lewis acidic behavior and high catalytic performance, have been recognized as a relatively cheap, low-toxicity, stable, green, and efficient catalysts for various important organic transformations. Commercially available inorganic zirconium chloride was widely applied as a catalyst to accelerate amination, Michael addition, and oxidation reactions. Well-designed zirconocene perfluorosulfonates can be applied in allylation, acylation, esterification, etc. N-Chelating oganozirconium complexes accelerate polymerization, hydroaminoalkylation, and CO2 fixation efficiently. In this review, the applications of both commercially available and synthesized zirconium catalysts in organic reactions in the last 5 years are highlighted. Firstly, the properties and application of zirconium and its compounds are simply introduced. After presenting the superiority of zirconium compounds, their applications as catalysts to accelerate organic transformations are classified and presented in detail. On the basis of different kinds of zirconium catalysts, organic reactions accelerated by inorganic zirconium catalysts, zirconium catalysts bearing Cp, and organozirconium catalysts without Cp are summarized, and the plausible reaction mechanisms are presented if available.

Originally described as a heat-labile fraction of the serum responsible for the opsonization and subsequent lytic killing of bacteria, work over the last century firmly established complement as a key mediator of the general inflammatory response but also as an acknowledged vital bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. However, recent studies particularly spanning the last decade have provided new insights into the novel modes and locations of complement activation and highlighted unexpected additional biological functions for this ancient system, for example, in regulating basic processes of the cell. In this review, we will cover the current knowledge about complement’s established and novel roles in innate and adaptive immunity with a focus on the functional differences between serum circulating and intracellularly active complement and will describe and discuss the newly discovered cross-talks of complement with other cell effector systems particularly during T-cell induction and contraction. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Though they are currently being phased out, their persistence in the environment is widespread. There is increasing evidence linking PFAS exposure to health effects, an issue of concern since PFAS such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooc-tanoic acid (PFOA) bioaccumulate in humans, with a half-life of years. Many epidemiological studies suggest that, worldwide, semen quality has decreased over the past several decades. One of the most worrying effects of PFOS and PFOA is their associations with lower testosterone levels, similar to clinical observations in infertile men. This review thus focuses on PFOS/PFOA-associated effects on male reproductive health. The sources of PFAS in drinking water are listed. The current epide-miological studies linking increased exposure to PFAS with lowered testosterone and semen quality, and evidence from rodent studies supporting their function as endocrine disruptors on the reproductive system, exhibiting non-monotonic dose responses, are noted. Finally, their mechanisms of action and possible toxic effects on the Leydig, Sertoli, and germ cells are discussed. Future research efforts must consider utilizing better human model systems for exposure, using more accurate PFAS exposure susceptibility windows, and improvements in statistical modeling of data to account for the endocrine disruptor properties of PFAS. © 2021 by the authors.

We performed a literature search using PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus via the library at University of California San Francisco, and a hand search of relevant text books to investigate products that can be considered anti-irritants in either prevention or treatment. Emphasis was placed on studies that included quantitative and qualitative results and that followed evidence-based dermatological guidelines. Anti-irritants provide some evidences that they may be beneficial in reducing ICD though some studies indicated no effect. The conflicting observations summarized here suggest that well controlled, but often arduous, field type studies are required for confirmation. Anti-irritant agents counteract or suppress irritation responses. These agents/ingredients, regardless of whether naturally occurring or man-made, used alone or in formulations, should possess the capacity to reduce irritation caused by acute and chronic exposure to irritants [1]. Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is common in the workplace and at home [2]. During daily activities, human skin may be exposed to potential irritants (for example, surfactants, cutting oils, etc.) that might result in ICD [3, 4]. Minimizing exposure to such harmful substances is recommended but often not practical since in many occupations, for instance, farmers, forest firefighters, outdoor activities, hospitals and even households such encounters are ubiquitous. To prevent or reduce the risk of developing ICD, anti-irritants agents/substances including barrier creams (BC) and moisturizers are widely utilized [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Though BC and moisturizers are not identical, probably, due to their ambiguous definitions, the terms BC and moisturizers are often used interchangeably in the literature and marketplace. The BC target is in the prevention of external noxious substances penetrating skin, used usually in occupational settings [6, 8, 9, 10] and moisturizers are frequently used for ""dry"" skin conditions as well as to maintain healthy skin [5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13]. However, moisturizers and BC may share characteristics [5]; to strictly distinguish between them may be difficult. Therefore, standardized terminology of skin protection is suggested [14]. We summarize the common terms and definitions in this field, as listed in Table 1. Numerous ingredients have been formulated into the skin protection products in the marketplace. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only endorsed 13 skin protectants for over-the-counter (OTC) products [15]. Based (Table Presented) on an extensive literature review, we summarize related studies and data of the efficacy of proposed anti-irritant agents/substances in reducing ICD in man. Studies were excluded if not conducted inman, as there is limited validation data relating such animal studies to men. © 2010 Dustri-Verlag Dr. Karl Feistle.",allantoin; aluminum hydroxide; aluminum hydroxychloride; borage oil; calamine; dexpanthenol; dimeticone; fish oil; glycerol; hydrocortisone; kaolin; lipid emulsion; non prescription drug; perfluoropolyether derivative; petrolatum; pimecrolimus; polyether derivative; propolis; rapeseed oil; skin protective agent; sunflower oil; tannin; Theobroma oil; unclassified drug; urea; water oil cream; white petrolatum; zinc acetate; zinc carbonate; zinc oxide; agricultural worker; contact dermatitis; emulsion; evidence based practice; fire fighter; food and drug administration; home; human; hydrogel; irritant dermatitis; long term exposure; nonhuman; practice guideline; review; skin penetration; skin protection; workplace

PFOA in soil can enter plants, affect plant growth and threaten food safety. Therefore, understanding the plant utilization and phytotoxicity of PFOA is conducive to assessing the environmental risk of soil contaminated with PFOA. This review analyzed recent studies about the uptake and effects of PFOA on terrestrial plants from the aspects of absorption, transport, distribution, phytotoxicity, and the underlying mechanism. Based on current research, PFOA was predominantly taken by plant roots and showed adverse effects on plants by affecting the antioxidant system and metabolic process. Research in field or higher terrestrial plants is still very scarce. Given the importance of exploring the potential remediation methods for PFOA, more research with comprehensive consideration of soil and environmental factors should be carried out to tell its specific mechanisms of plant utilization and toxicity action. © 2022 The Author(s).

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overview of these associations. Methods: The online databases PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched comprehensively for eligible studies from inception to February 2021. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random- or fixed-effects models, and dose-response meta-analyses were also conducted when possible. Findings: A total of 29 studies (32,905 participants) were included. The pooled results demonstrated that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure during pregnancy was linearly associated with increased preterm birth risk (pooled OR per 1-ng/ml increase: 1.01, 95% CIs: 1.00–1.02, P = 0.009) and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) exposure showed inverted U-shaped associations with preterm birth risk (P values for the nonlinear trend: 0.025 and 0.030). Positive associations were also observed for exposure to perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) and miscarriage (pooled OR per 1-ng/ml increase: 1.87, 95% CIs: 1.15–3.03) and PFOS and preeclampsia (pooled OR per 1-log increase: 1.27, 95% CIs: 1.06–1.51), whereas exposure to perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA) was inversely associated with preeclampsia risk (pooled OR per 1-log increase: 0.81, 95% CIs: 0.71–0.93). Based on individual evidence, detrimental effects were observed between PFDA exposure and small for gestational age and between PFOA and PFOS and intrauterine growth restriction. No significant associations were found between pregnancy PFAS exposure and other adverse pregnancy outcomes (i.e., gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced hypertension, low birth weight, and large and small for gestational age). Interpretation: Our findings indicated that PFOS, PFOA and PFNA exposure during pregnancy might be associated with increased preterm birth risk and that PFAS exposure might be associated with the risk of miscarriage and preeclampsia. Due to the limited evidence obtained for most associations, additional studies are required to confirm these findings. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","n methyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide acetate; organofluorine derivative; perfluoroalkanoic acid; perfluorobutane sulfonate; perfluorobutanoate; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctane sulfonamide; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoropentanoate; perfluorotetradecanoate; perfluorotridecanoate; perfluoroundecanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; sulfonamide; sulfonic acid derivative; toxic substance; unclassified drug; chemical substance; concentration (composition); diabetes; health risk; literature review; meta-analysis; pollution exposure; pregnancy; risk factor; adolescent; adult; adverse outcome; case control study; cohort analysis; disease association; Embase; environmental exposure; evidence based practice; female; fetus outcome; high risk pregnancy; human; intrauterine growth retardation; large for gestational age; low birth weight; maternal blood; maternal exposure; maternal hypertension; Medline; mother; newborn disease; nonlinear system; observational study; preeclampsia; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; prenatal exposure; progeny; Review; risk factor; small for date infant; spontaneous abortion; systematic review; trend study; Web of Science; meta analysis; newborn; pregnancy; prematurity; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Premature Birth"

Many of the common luminescent conjugated polymers, e.g. derivatives of poly(phenylenevinylene) and poly(fluorene), are predominantly hole transporters (i.e. p-dopable). This article gives a brief overview of organic electroluminescence and electrophosphorescence and provides a more detailed consideration of ways in which electron transport in these systems has been enhanced by the incorporation of electron-deficient (i.e. n-dopable) small molecules and polymers into the devices, either as blends or by covalent attachment of sub-units to the luminophore or as an additional electron-transporting, hole-blocking (ETHB) layer adjacent to the cathode. The chemical structures of these systems are presented and their roles are assessed. Most of these ETHB molecules are electron-deficient aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocycles, e.g. derivatives of 1,3,4-oxadiazole, pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, quinoline, etc. Non-aromatic thiophene-S,S-dioxide derivatives are also discussed.

In this paper we review various grouping strategies that could be used to inform actions on these chemicals and outline the motivations, advantages and disadvantages for each. Grouping strategies are subdivided into (1) those based on the intrinsic properties of the PFAS (e.g. persistence, bioaccumulation potential, toxicity, mobility, molecular size) and (2) those that inform risk assessment through estimation of cumulative exposure and/or effects. The most precautionary grouping approach of those reviewed within this article suggests phasing out PFAS based on their high persistence alone (the so-called ""P-sufficient""approach). The least precautionary grouping approach reviewed advocates only grouping PFAS for risk assessment that have the same toxicological effects, modes and mechanisms of action, and elimination kinetics, which would need to be well documented across different PFAS. It is recognised that, given jurisdictional differences in chemical assessment philosophies and methodologies, no one strategy will be generally acceptable. The guiding question we apply to the reviewed grouping strategies is: grouping for what purpose? The motivation behind the grouping (e.g. determining use in products vs. setting guideline levels for contaminated environments) may lead to different grouping decisions. This assessment provides the necessary context for grouping strategies such that they can be adopted as they are, or built on further, to protect human and environmental health from potential PFAS-related effects. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",Biochemistry; International trade; Motivation; Philosophical aspects; Risk perception; Bioaccumulation potential; Contaminated environment; Cumulative exposures; Elimination kinetics; Environmental health; Grouping strategies; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Toxicological effects; Risk assessment; bioaccumulation; environmental health; human; kinetics; molecular size; motivation; philosophy; practice guideline; review; risk assessment; toxicology; fluorocarbon; Bioaccumulation; Environmental Health; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Risk Assessment

In the present work we review the characteristics of bronchoalveolar lavage in patients suffering from hypersensitivity pneumonitis in order to study the mechanisms through which the disease appears after integrating such characteristics with the classical histological, clinical and biochemical data. Bronchoalveolar lavage in these patients demonstrates the following: An elevation in the number of total cells that is higher than in any other interstitial pathology. Morphological, biochemical and functional data suggestive of activation of alveolar macrophages. An elevation in lymphocyte percentages with data characteristic of activation. The rise occurs in the two lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4 and CD8), although there is a predominance, in the rise in C8 lymphocytes, such that the CD4/CD8 ratio decreases. A rise is also observed in ""natural killer"" cells. Functionally, there are data that reveal an increase in the inducer potential of T lymphocytes together with an increase in cytotoxic capacity, in all their subpopulations. The results on the lymphocyte count vary broadly according to the course of the disease. Varying increases in neutrophils, eosinophils and mast cells. The rises in the first two kinds of cells indicate recent contact with the antigen, while the rise in mast cells seems to be of pathogenic significance.

These problems can both be potentially solvedviaa bifunctional catalytic system with integrated components that can directly convert CO2into hydrocarbons. There are two possible reaction pathways involved in this catalytic system, but compared to the reverse water gas shift-Fischer Tropsch synthesis (RWGS-FTS) route, the methanol route potentially has a higher selectivity of desired products due to its ability to overcome the restriction of the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) distribution. The methanol route requires bifunctional catalysts consisting of metal/metal oxide and zeolite components. The former is used to convert CO2into methanol, whereas the latter is used to convert methanol into hydrocarbons. This review first discusses the development of metal/metal oxide single component catalysts to enhance the hydrogenation of CO2, methanol selectivity, and methanol yield. Next, the development of zeolite single-component catalysts for the methanol to hydrocarbon (MTH) reaction by minimising coke formation and tuning the hydrocarbon selectivity is discussed, and finally the development of integrated bifunctional catalystsviathe methanol route is introduced. Overall, although bifunctional catalytic systems can successfully achieve the desired product selectivity for all hydrocarbons, they suffer from high CO selectivity at a high operating temperature, which needs to be addressed to enhance the yield and selectivity of a specific hydrocarbon. At this stage, it could not be confirmed if bifunctional catalytic systems can effectively decrease the CO2content globally, while acting as an effective alternative hydrocarbon source until a complete life cycle analysis is conducted. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that bifunctional catalytic systems demonstrate much better potential and benefits than separate multi-step catalysts in different reactors because under the same reaction conditions, bifunctional catalysts demonstrate higher CO2conversion and lower CO selectivity than single metal/metal oxide catalysts and longer catalyst lifetimes than single zeolite catalysts, while maintaining selectivity for desired hydrocarbon products. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",Carbon dioxide; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogenation; Life cycle; Methanol; Water gas shift; Zeolites; Anderson-Schulz-Flory distributions; Bi-functional catalysts; Carbon dioxide hydrogenation; High operating temperature; Methanol-to-hydrocarbons; Product selectivities; Reverse water gas shift; Single-component catalysts; Catalyst selectivity

Fosfomycin is a broad-spectrum bactericidal antibiotic that inhibits cell wall biosynthesis in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. This antibiotic has a unique mechanism of action and inhibits the initial step in peptidoglycan biosynthesis by blocking the enzyme, MurA. Fosfomycin has been used successfully for the treatment of urinary tract infections for a long time, but the increased emergence of antibiotic resistance has made fosfomycin a suitable candidate for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens, especially in combination with other therapeutic partners. The acquisition of fosfomycin resistance could threaten the reintroduction of this antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infection. Here, we analyse the mechanism of action and molecular mechanisms for the development of fosfomycin resistance, including the modification of the antibiotic target, reduced antibiotic uptake and antibiotic inactivation.

Contaminated drinking water and food are the most significant exposure sources to these chemicals. Ingested PFASs are bio-accumulative and have adverse effect on health of humans as well as animal organisms. This paper reviews the most significant information on the origin, properties, distribution, environmental fate, human exposure, health effects, and the environmental regulations on PFASs and summarizes the latest advances in the development of novel methods for the effective removal of these chemicals from the aqueous environment. Recognized (reverse osmosis, adsorption on activated carbon) and most promising developing removal methods such as adsorption on biomaterials (plant proteins, chitosan beds), mineral adsorbents (LDHs, hydrotalcite), ion-exchange resins, and photocatalytic degradation have been emphasized. © Copyright by Polish Academy of Sciences.",NA

Organically complexed minerals have many advantages over inorganic sources. It has improved absorption and efficacy, which meets the bird's requirements comfortably with a low-dose level. Hence, inorganic forms can be replaced with lower-dose levels of organic minerals without any adverse effects on production performances in broilers and layers. PFAs possess medicinal properties, such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, adaptogenic, and immunomodulatory, therefore, could be recommended as supplements. They are also growth promoters that enhance the overall health status and augment poultry birds' production performance. Furthermore, the tremendous potential of PFAs could be extracted with the recent advances in science and technology. With the advantages of organically complexed minerals and multiple beneficial applications, there is a resurgence to develop PFAs as a cocktail of organic minerals to improve the overall health status of poultry birds and augment their productivity, which, in turn, helps the poultry industry to grow decisively and economically. © Bhagwat, et al.

Cholangitis was the cause of death in three patients. Repeated endoscopic interventions were: transient nasobiliary drainage without drain replacement in two patients and four changes of stents in three patients. In the 13 patients, surviving and wearing their drains at least for 100 days the patency of the double drains was 157 days. These results obtained in the long-time survivors support the comparability of the patency of double teflon stent to that of metalstents.

Outside red blood cells, the Hb tetramer dissociates into dimers, which exhibit high oxygen affinity and neither cooperativity nor allosteric regulation. They are prone to extravasate, thus scavenging endothelial NO and causing hypertension, and cause nephrotoxicity. In addition, they are more prone to autoxidation, generating radicals. The need to overcome the adverse effects associated with cell-free Hb has always been a major hurdle in the development of substitutes of allogeneic blood transfusions for all clinical situations where blood is unavailable or cannot be used due to, for example, religious objections. This class of therapeutics, indicated as hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs), is formed by genetically and/or chemically modified Hbs. Many efforts were devoted to the exploitation of the wealth of biochemical and biophysical information available on Hb structure, function, and dynamics to design safe HBOCs, overcoming the negative effects of free plasma Hb. Unfortunately, so far, no HBOC has been approved by FDA and EMA, except for compassionate use. However, the unmet clinical needs that triggered intensive investigations more than fifty years ago are still awaiting an answer.

Although humans may be exposed simultaneously to numerous hazards, little is known about the interaction of prenatal chemical exposures with other factors, such as maternal stress, itself a modifier of fetal development. Gestational stress has been hypothesized to enhance the developmental toxicity of chemicals. This review identified 36 animal studies investigating if maternal stress may enhance the effects of prenatal chemical exposure, and evaluated the presented hypothesis. Studies of a broad range of chemicals and developmental endpoints support the notion, that maternal stress is able to enhance the effects of developmental toxicants, although stress mitigated chemically induced effects in a few cases. Maternal stress most often enhanced chemical developmental toxicity at dose levels associated with severe maternal toxicity or where test agents were already above threshold for effect. Thus, LOAELchemical was generally similar to LOAELchemical + stress, although not necessarily for the same endpoint. It should be noted that the database contained a limited number of studies, and only a single high dose level was applied in most studies, rendering establishment of NOAELs for combined exposures impossible. Furthermore, for some compounds, the margin between human exposure levels and the LOAELchemical + stress seems small. Future studies are recommended to investigate compounds, for which maternal stress was already proven as an enhancer, at lower dose levels. Interactive response seems to depend on stressor severity and timing of chemical exposure relative to maternal stress which should be further scrutinized. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, this positivism on the market is fogged because the discharge of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites into the environment, including water, also increases due to their inappropriate management, treatment and disposal; now, worldwide, this fact is recognized as an environmental concern and human health risk. Intriguingly, researchers have studied the most effective methods for pharmaceutical removal in wastewater; however, the types of pharmaceuticals investigated in most of these studies do not reflect the most produced and consumed pharmaceuticals on the market. Hence, an attempt was done to analyze the pharmaceutical market, drugs consumption trends and the pharmaceutical research interests worldwide. Notwithstanding, the intensive research work done in different pharmaceutical research fronts such as disposal and fate, environmental impacts and concerns, human health risks, removal, degradation and development of treatment technologies, found that such research is not totally aligned with the market trends and consumption patterns. There are other drivers and interests that promote the pharmaceutical research.

When assembly occurs on a target cell membrane the forming complex inserts into and through the bilayer to create a pore, the membrane attack complex (MAC). On some targets, pore formation causes rapid lytic destruction; however, most nucleated cell targets resist lysis through a combination of ion pumps, membrane regulators and active recovery processes. Cells survive but not without consequence. The MAC pore causes ion fluxes and directly or indirectly impacts several important signalling pathways that in turn activate a diverse series of events in the cell, many of which are highly pro-inflammatory. Although this non-lytic, pro-inflammatory role of MAC has been recognised for thirty years, no consensus signalling pathway has emerged.

This important platelet function has received significant research attention for >150 years. The immune cell functions of platelets are much less appreciated. Platelets interact with and activate cells of all branches of immunity in response to pathogen exposures and infection, as well as in response to sterile tissue injury. In this review, we focus on innate immune mechanisms of platelet activation, platelet interactions with innate immune cells, as well as the intersection of platelets and adaptive immunity. The immune potential of platelets is dependent in part on their megakaryocyte precursor providing them with the molecular composition to be first responders and immune sentinels in initiating and orchestrating coordinated pathogen immune responses. There is emerging evidence that extramedullary megakaryocytes may be immune differentiated compared with bone marrow megakaryocytes, but the physiological relevance of immunophenotypic differences are just beginning to be explored. These concepts are also discussed in this review. The immune functions of the megakaryocyte/ platelet lineage have likely evolved to coordinate the need to repair a vascular breach with the simultaneous need to induce an immune response that may limit pathogen invasion once the blood is exposed to an external environment. © 2022 American Heart Association, Inc.","alpha defensin; beta defensin; C type lectin receptor; caspase recruitment domain protein 15; caspase recruitment domain protein 4; complement; complement component C1; complement component C3; complement component C3a; complement component C3b; complement component C4d; complement component C5a; complement component C5a receptor; complement component C5b; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; Fc receptor; lectin receptor; toll like receptor; toll like receptor 1; toll like receptor 2; toll like receptor 3; toll like receptor 4; toll like receptor 7; toll like receptor 8; toll like receptor 9; unclassified drug; adaptive immunity; bone marrow; cell differentiation; cell function; cell lineage; cell maturation; complement system; endosome; extracellular trap; heterotypic aggregate; human; immune response; immunocompetent cell; immunophenotyping; infection; infectious agent; innate immunity; lung; lymphocyte differentiation; megakaryocyte; molecular recognition; monocyte; NETosis; neutrophil; nonhuman; protein function; Review; T lymphocyte activation; thrombocyte activation; thrombocyte aggregation; thrombocyte function; thrombosis; animal; immunology; megakaryocyte; thrombocyte; Adaptive Immunity; Animals; Blood Platelets; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Megakaryocytes"

Activation of the complement system plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of SLE. For the past several decades, laboratory monitoring of SLE has focused primarily on measurement of serum C3, C4, and their activation products. However, the utility of these measures as biomarkers for diagnosis and assessment of disease activity of SLE is still debated. Over the same time span, knowledge of the complement system has advanced remarkably, with more than 30 proteins identified. In view of the urgent need for identifying reliable lupus biomarkers, it is appropriate to revisit the issue of whether the complement system is a potential source of biomarkers for SLE. This article will review historical aspects of complement measurement in SLE, and summarize recent advances that may lead to a newly rejuvenated ""gold rush"" to mine the complement system for biomarkers of SLE. Specifically, development and utility of a novel assay that measures cell-bound complement activation products as lupus biomarkers will be discussed. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Previous epidemiological studies suggest association of maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes, while evidences about the association are inconsistent. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the relationship of maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Twenty-one relevant studies were identified from three databases before 2020. The quality, heterogeneity and possibility of publication bias of included studies were evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, Q-statistic and Begg's test, respectively. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained by means of random-effects meta-analysis models. Meta-analysis results revealed that maternal exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) may have a positive association with preterm birth (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.38). The pooled estimates also showed limited evidence of association between maternal perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure and miscarriage (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 0.92, 2.38) with obvious heterogeneity (I2 = 93.9, p &lt; 0.01). However, no such significant associations were found between the other PFASs and miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth. In addition, the subgroup analyses showed that studies on the relationship of maternal PFASs exposure and miscarriage were mainly contributed by developed countries. The meta-analysis results indicated maternal exposure to PFOS can increase the risk of preterm birth. The results of the included studies are inconsistent and the effects of PFASs on human health are complex.

However, AR ramifications in developing countries are worsened by limited molecular diagnostics, expensive therapeutics, inadequate numbers of skilled clinicians and scientists, and unsanitary environments. The epidemiology of Gram-negative bacteria, their AR genes, and geographical distribution in Africa are described here. Data were extracted and analyzed from English-language articles published between 2015 and December 2019. The genomes and AR genes of the various species, obtained from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) and NCBI were analyzed phylogenetically using Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood (RAxML) and annotated with Figtree. The geographic location of resistant clones/clades was mapped manually. Thirty species from 31 countries and 24 genera from 41 countries were analyzed from 146 articles and 3,028 genomes, respectively. Genes mediating resistance to β-lactams (including blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M, blaNDM, blaIMP, blaVIM, and blaOXA-48/181), fluoroquinolones (oqxAB, qnrA/B/ D/S, gyrA/B, and parCE mutations, etc.), aminoglycosides (including armA and rmtC/ F), sulfonamides (sul1/2/3), trimethoprim (dfrA), tetracycline [tet(A/B/C/D/G/O/M/39)], colistin (mcr-1), phenicols (catA/B, cmlA), and fosfomycin (fosA) were mostly found in Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and also in Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter baumannii, etc., on mostly IncF-type, IncX3/4, ColRNAI, and IncR plasmids, within IntI1 gene cassettes, insertion sequences, and transposons. Clonal and multiclonal outbreaks and dissemination of resistance genes across species and countries and between humans, animals, plants, and the environment were observed; Escherichia coli ST103, K. pneumoniae ST101, S. enterica ST1/2, and Vibrio cholerae ST69/515 were common strains. Most pathogens were of human origin, and zoonotic transmissions were relatively limited. IMPORTANCE Antibiotic resistance (AR) is one of the major public health threats and challenges to effective containment and treatment of infectious bacterial diseases worldwide. Here, we used different methods to map out the geographical hot spots, sources, and evolutionary epidemiology of AR. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., Neisseria meningitis/gonorrhoeae, Vibrio cholerae, Campylobacter jejuni, etc., were common pathogens shuttling AR genes in Africa. Transmission of the same clones/strains across countries and between animals, humans, plants, and the environment was observed. We recommend Enterobacter spp. or K. pneumoniae as better sentinel species for AR surveillance. Copyright © 2020 Osei Sekyere and Reta.

The incense mixtures contained either a CP47,497-C8-homologe or JWH-018, or both in combination. Synthetic cannabinoids could not be detected in some mixtures. The German penal code sanctions persons who drive a motor vehicle unsafely following consumption of inebriating substances. Therefore the legal basis of the sanction is analytical proof of psycho-active substances in the driver's blood. A method for quantitative detection of JWH-018 in serum was developed because some of the ""Spice"" incense mixtures contained JWH-018 as the only active component. More specifically, serum samples were concentrated using a C18 solid-phase extraction column and the extracts were effectively analyzed using the LC-MS/MS System. The detection limit and the quantification limit were 0.2 ng/mL and 0.6 ng/mL respectively. Other popular drugs did not interfere with this highly selective quantification of JWH-018 in serum. When using this detection method to test forensic blood samples, JWH-018 concentrations ranging from 0.2 ng/mL to 2.5 ng/mL were measured. Therefore it is possible to detect JWH-018 - one of the psycho-active ingredients of the incense drug ""Spice"" - in serum and thus provide the analytical evidence necessary for criminal prosecution.",3 (1 naphthoyl) 1 pentylindole; cannabinoid derivative; unclassified drug; human; liquid chromatography; review; solid phase extraction; tandem mass spectrometry

We critically reviewed current evidence from human epidemiological, in vitro, and animal studies, including mammalian and aquatic model organisms. Epidemiological studies identified the associations between perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure and epigenetic changes in both adult populations and birth cohorts. For in vitro studies, various cell types including neuroblasts, preadipocytes, and hepatocytes have been employed to understand epigenetic effects of PFAS. In studies with animal models, effects of early life exposure to PFAS have been examined using rodent models, and aquatic models (e.g., zebrafish) have been more frequently used in recent years. Several studies highlighted oxidative stress as a key mediator between epigenetic modification and health effects. Collectively, previous research clearly suggest involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in PFAS induced toxicity, though these efforts have primarily focused on specific PFASs (i.e. mainly PFOS and PFOA) or endpoints (i.e. cancer). Additional studies are necessary to define specific linkages among epigenetic mechanisms and related biomarkers or phenotypical changes. In addition, future research is also needed for understudied PFAS and complex mixtures.

These features make high-melting waxes suitable for use in foods, cosmetics, materials processing, electronic machinery, national defense, aviation, medical fields, etc. Considering the fast growth of technology and the electronics industry, the world’s economy relies on the production and utilization of high-quality high-melting waxes. However, most waxes in the world’s current markets are prepared from mineral oils, and such commercial waxes have melting points in the range of 50–70 °C. Considering the rapid consumption of high-melting waxes and specialty waxes, their supply insufficiency is anticipated to exceed 700000 t. High-melting waxes are divided into polyethylene (PE) wax and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) wax, based on synthesis methodology. PE wax can be obtained via the polymerization of ethylene and can also be prepared via the thermal or catalytic cracking of plastics. PE cracking to form waxes, with the advantage of low cost, can effectively solve the problem of “white pollution” and make use of existing catalytic cracking units. However, this process results in high energy consumption to achieve waste polymer depolymerization and exhibits some drawbacks, such as a wide carbon number distribution and high impurity content in the obtained PE waxes. However, there are some new methods for synthesizing PE waxes, such as cross alkane metathesis. The FTS, which uses carbon monoxide and hydrogen as raw materials, realizes the synthesis of waxes through carbon chain growth. Although the high-melting FTS waxes display excellent performance and the technology is gradually maturing, FTS waxes with different melting points are produced by rectification of products with various carbon chain lengths. Nonetheless, PE and FTS waxes are widely used in various industries because of their excellent properties. However, their synthesis is based on petroleum and coal-derived chemical products. Biomass-derived waxes have a narrow melting range due to their precise carbon chain growth process. Based on different application demands, small biomass platform molecules can be functionalized to fabricate biomass-derived waxes with special functions. More importantly, the biomass-based synthesis route is sustainable and in-line with the global values for mitigating carbon dioxide emissions and achieving carbon neutrality. This review discusses the recent advances in the synthesis techniques for high-melting waxes, including PE waxes, FTS waxes, and biomass-derived waxes. Furthermore, the catalysts and reaction mechanisms involved in the synthesis of high-melting waxes are discussed in detail. Finally, the perspectives and trends of high-melting waxes are reviewed to promote the emergence of new processes and technical routes. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.",NA

Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on PFAS exposure and birth outcomes. Methods: Three electronic databases were searched for epidemiological studies through February 13, 2021. We used random-effects meta-analysis for eight birth outcome indicators to calculate summary effect estimates for various exposure types. The risk of bias and the overall quality and level of evidence for each exposure-outcome pair were assessed. Results: The initial search identified 58 potentially eligible studies, of which 46 were ultimately included. Many PFAS were found to have previously unrecognized statistically significant associations with birth outcomes. Specifically, birth weight (BW) was associated with PFAS, with effect sizes ranging from −181.209 g (95% confidence interval (CI) = −360.620 to −1.798) per 1 ng/ml increase in perfluoroheptanesulfonate (PFHpS) to −24.252 g (95% CI = −38.574 to −9.930) per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase in perfluorodecaoic acid (PFDA). Similar patterns were observed between other PFAS and birth outcomes: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) with birth length (BL) and ponderal index (PI), PFOS and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA) with head circumference (HC), PFHpS with gestational age (GA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and PFHpS with preterm birth (PTB). Additionally, PFDA showed a statistically significant association with small for gestational age (SGA). The level of the combined evidence for each exposure-outcome pair was considered to be “moderate”. Conclusion: This study showed that PFAS exposure was significantly associated with increased risks of various adverse birth outcomes and that different birth outcome indicators had different degrees of sensitivity to PFAS. Further studies are needed to confirm our results by expanding the sample size, clarifying the effects of different types or doses of PFAS and the time of blood collection on birth outcomes, and fully considering the possible confounders.

Results from generic multimedia box models, spatially resolved multimedia box models, and atmospheric transport models are highlighted, including conceptual investigations of cold-trap effect and global fractionation as well as results for particular chemicals, such as hexachlorocyclohexanes, DDT, polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluoroocctanoic acid, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Comparison of model results to field data shows that in many cases environmental fate models provide a good description of the distribution dynamics observed in the field, with deviations between measured and modeled concentrations around a factor of five. Sorption to atmospheric aerosols as a key process influencing the LRT of semivolatile organic chemicals (SOCs) is discussed, and the need for more measurements of the aerosol-air partitioning of SOCs and of the reactivity of particle-bound chemicals is pointed out. Key findings from field campaigns measuring legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) as well as new POPs are summarized. Finally, the relationship between science and politics in the field of POPs is addressed. Research into the LRT of organic chemicals has always occurred in interaction with political activities aiming to reduce the emissions of POPs. Since the late 1990s, the Stockholm Convention and the Aarhus Protocol on POPs have formed an important political context for research concerning POPs; the implementation of these international treaties creates a demand for ongoing research into the LRT of organic chemicals. © 2009 SETAC.","Atmospheric transport models; Box models; Environmental fate models; Environmental fates; Field campaigns; Field datum; Hexachlorocyclohexanes; International treaties; Key process; Long-range transport; Model results; Persistent organic pollutants Current-use pesticides; Political activities; Political contexts; Poly-brominated diphenyl ethers; Spatially resolved; Stockholm; Transboundary air pollution; Trap effects; Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; Ethers; Industrial chemicals; Organic pollutants; Pesticides; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Sorption; Organic chemicals; chlorphenotane; hexachlorocyclohexane; organic compound; perfluorooctanoic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; DDT; environmental fate; environmental modeling; fractionation; HCH; long range transport; organic pollutant; PBDE; PCB; sorption; volatile organic compound; aerosol; air pollution control; atmospheric transport; controlled study; fractionation; model; organic pollution; pollution transport; priority journal; review; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Models, Chemical; Organic Chemicals"
NA,Dosimetric anchoring of In vivo and In vitro studies for perfluorooctanoate and perfluorooctanesulfonate,2013,NA,NA,"In order to compare between in vivo toxicity studies, dosimetry is needed to translate study-specific dose regimens into dose metrics such as tissue concentration. These tissue concentrations may then be compared with in vitro bioactivity assays to perhaps identify mechanisms relevant to the lowest observed effect level (LOEL) dose group and the onset of the observed in vivo toxicity. Here, we examine the perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS). We analyzed 9 in vivo toxicity studies for PFOA and 13 in vivo toxicity studies for PFOS. Both PFCs caused multiple effects in various test species, strains, and genders. We used a Bayesian pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling framework to incorporate data from 6 PFOA PK studies and 2 PFOS PK studies (conducted in 3 species) to predict dose metrics for the in vivo LOELs and no observed effect levels (NOELs). We estimated PK parameters for 11 combinations of chemical, species, strain, and gender. Despite divergent study designs and species-specific PK, for a given effect, we found that the predicted dose metrics corresponding to the LOELs (and NOELs where available) occur at similar concentrations. In vitro assay results for PFOA and PFOS from EPA's ToxCast project were then examined. We found that most in vitro bioactivity occurs at concentrations lower than the predicted concentrations for the in vivo LOELs and higher than the predicted concentrations for the in vivo NOELs (where available), for a variety of nonimmunological effects. These results indicate that given sufficient PK data, the in vivo LOELs dose regimens, but not necessarily the effects, could have been predicted from in vitro studies for these 2 PFCs. © The Author 2013.

NA,Persistent Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals and Fatty Liver Disease.,2017,NA,NA,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prominent chronic liver disease in Western countries, affecting approximately 25% of the population worldwide. Sex-specific differences in the development of NAFLD are apparent. While obesity and insulin resistance are major contributors to the increasing prevalence of NAFLD, a growing body of literature suggests that exposure to persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals (pEDCs) may also play a role. This review summarizes recent (2011 and later) scientific literature investigating exposures to pEDCs, specifically persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and NAFLD, with a focus on sex-specific associations. RECENT FINDINGS: The overwhelming majority of studies were conducted in single-sex animal models and provide biological evidence that exposures to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin polychlorinated biphenyls, and other POPs or POP mixtures are negatively associated with liver health. There were four cross-sectional epidemiological studies in humans that reported associations for several POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls and perfluorinated chemicals, with elevated liver enzymes. Only one of these studies, using a sample of gastric bypass surgery patients, examined sex-specific associations of POPs and liver enzymes, finding adverse associations among women only. The noticeable lack of studies investigating how differences (i.e., biochemical, physiological, and behavioral) between men and women may influence associations of pEDCs and NAFLD represents a large research gap in environmental health. Sexual dimorphism in metabolic processes throughout the body, including the liver, is established but often overlooked in the designs and analyses of studies. Other factors identified in this review that may also act to modulate associations of environmental chemicals and NAFLD are reproductive status and dietary nutrient intakes, which also remain understudied in the literature. Despite knowledge of sexual dimorphism in the actions of pEDCs, as well as in metabolic processes related to NAFLD development, few experimental or epidemiological studies have investigated sex-dependent associations. Future studies, especially those in humans, should be designed to address this research need. Consideration of other factors, such as reproductive status, dietary intakes, and mixtures of chemicals with varying endocrine-disrupting capabilities, should be explored.",NA

Secondly, the synthesis of dendritic hyperbranched poly(methyl methacrylate)s (PMMAs) and their functionalized block copolymers using a novel iterative methodology is described. The methodology involves a two-reaction sequence in each iterative process: (a) a linking reaction of α-functionalized living anionic PMMA with tert-butyldimethylsilyloxymethylphenyl (SMP) groups with benzyl bromide (BnBr)-chain-end-functionalized polymer and (b) a transformation reaction of the SMP groups into BnBr functions. This reaction sequence is repeated several times to construct high-generation (maximum seventh generation) dendritic hyperbranched polymers. Similar branched architectural block copolymers have also been synthesized by the same iterative methodology using other α-functionalized living anionic polymers. Surface structures of the resulting dendritic hyperbranched block copolymers composed of PMMA and poly(2-(perfluorobutyl)ethyl methacrylate) segments have been characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle measurements.

The diversity of manufactured PreFOS and its degradation products (e.g. C8F17SO2R and C 8F17SO2NR′R′′, where R is H or F, and R′ and R′′ are various) has made it difficult to track their fate. Temporal trends of PFOS in both humans and wildlife are discrepant, thus it is difficult to predict future exposure, and hypotheses about the role of PreFOS have been raised. Although abiotic degradation of commercially important PreFOS materials requires further research, current data suggest that the yield of PFOS is negligible or minor. On the other hand, in vivo biotransformation of PreFOS yields PFOS as the major metabolite, and &gt;32% yields have been observed. In Canadians, exposure to PreFOS was equivalent or greater than direct PFOS exposure prior to 2002. In most ocean water, PFOS is dominant to PreFOS, but in the oceans east of Greenland there may be more PreFOS than PFOS, consistent with the fact that whales and humans in this region also show evidence of substantial PreFOS exposure. Quantitative assessments of PFOS body-burdens coming from PreFOS are complicated by the fact that PreFOS partitions to the cellular fraction of blood, thus biomonitoring in serum under predicts PreFOS relative to PFOS. Many unknowns exist that prevent accurate modelling, thus analytical methods that can distinguish directly manufactured PFOS, from PFOS that has been biotransformed from PreFOS, should be applied in future human and environmental monitoring. Two new source tracking principles are presented and applied to human serum. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",drinking water; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid precursor; sea water; unclassified drug; ambient air; atmosphere; bioaccumulation; biological monitoring; biotransformation; dust; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; food; human; hydrolysis; microbial degradation; nonhuman; oxidation; photolysis; priority journal; review; sea; sediment; serum; waste water management; whale; wildlife; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Biotransformation; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Food Analysis; Humans; Cetacea

The majority of inorganic contaminant studies focused on mercury and fish. While mercury concentrations were low in benthic feeding fish such as whitefish, predatory fish such as lake trout, pike, and walleye frequently had mercury levels which exceeded 0.2 μg/g, the consumption guideline for frequent consumers of fish, and 0.5 μg/g, the guideline for the commercial use of fish. Numerous consumption advisories were issued for lakes along the Mackenzie River. Relatively high mercury levels appear to be due to a combination of relatively old fish populations (because of light fishing pressures) and tend to be more prevalent in smaller lakes where warmer summer water temperatures and watershed influences result in greater mercury and methyl mercury inputs. Mercury levels were substantially lower in char than in lake trout, possibly due to a combination of a less fish-rich diet, a colder environment, and smaller MeHg watershed inputs. Less research has been conducted on other metals but some, such as rubidium, show pronounced variations in concentration that may be related to geological influences. Temporal trend monitoring has revealed little evidence of declining mercury levels in fish that can be attributed to declining atmospheric inputs. Because mercury follows complex pathways in the environment, other factors may operate to counteract reductions in atmospheric mercury sources, e.g., climatic variability, changes in the commercial fishery, and interactions between fish species. Most organochlorine (OC) investigations were based on long term trend monitoring and focused on char (Cornwallis Island), burbot (Great Slave Lake, Yukon lakes, Slave River at Fort Smith, Mackenzie River at Fort Good Hope) and lake trout (Yukon lakes, Great Slave Lake). There was strong evidence of declining OC concentrations in char, particularly ΣHCH and Σchlordane, which may reflect a response to declining atmospheric inputs. Endosulfan concentrations increased, as in the atmosphere. There also was evidence of declining OC concentrations in burbot in the Slave and Mackenzie rivers but not in Great Slave Lake and Yukon lakes. OC concentrations decreased in lake trout in Yukon lakes in the 2000s, most probably because of changes in the fish themselves (i.e., reduced lipid content, condition factor) and possibly climatic variability. Similarly, OCs declined in Great Slave Lake trout. New research on PDBEs and perfluorinated compounds determined that these contaminants are widespread in freshwater fish and concentrations may be increasing. Global warming is a major issue of concern for Arctic and Subarctic waters and may have adverse impacts on contaminant levels in fish and other biota. There is a need for contaminant studies in the north to be broadened to investigate climatic effects. In addition, monitoring studies should be broadened to consider factors affecting other aspects of fish biology. Foremost among these is integrating contaminant monitoring studies on lakes such as Lake Laberge and Great Slave Lake with stock assessment studies. Ecosystem based studies should be conducted on Great Slave Lake and Lake Laberge to more effectively understand contaminant trends and should consider inputs (atmospheric, river inflow, resupension), losses (sedimentation, volatilization), and biological pathways.

It is a serious problem that requires urgent attention. In this work, we review various PhCs detected in water treatment plants. We propose that fungi, particularly white-rot fungi (WRF), can be used for their bioremediation and describe the main mechanisms used for degrading this type of emerging pollutants; however, we also highlight the need to prospect for new fungal models. A conceptual proposal is made to develop an immobilization device containing a consortium of fungal species that can be placed in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP).

Their high consumption in human and veterinary medicine, food-producing animals and aquaculture, as well as persistence and poor absorption have caused antimicrobials to be discharged into receiving waters, with or without prior treatment, where they have been detected at ng-mg L−1 levels with the potential to cause effects on the various organisms living within aquatic systems.

Bats provide essential ecosystem services and a sustained, thriving population is vital for ecosystem health. Understanding issues threatening their survival is crucial for their protection and conservation. This paper provides the first review for 12. years on organic pollutants in bats and aims to investigate trends and any new issues impacting bat resilience. Organochlorine (OC) pesticides have been reported most often, especially in the older literature, with the dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), present at highest concentrations in tissues analyzed. The OC pesticide concentrations reported in bat tissues have declined significantly since the late 1970s, presumably as a result of restrictions in use. For example, DDE study mean concentrations over time periods 1970-1980, 1981-1999 and 2000-2013 ranged from 2.6-62, 0.05-2.31, 0.08-0.19. ppm wet weight, respectively. Exposure, however, still occurs from remaining residues, many years after the compounds have been actively used. In recent years (2000-2013), a range of other organic chemicals have been reported in bat tissues including brominated flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ether at a mean concentration of 2.9. ppm lipid weight) and perfluorinated compounds (perfluorooctanyl sulfonate at a mean concentration 0.09. ppm wet weight). The persistent organic compounds concentrate in tissues with higher fat content notably back-depot fat. Numerous factors influence exposure, residues detected and concentrations in different individuals, species and tissues which must be understood to provide meaningful assessment of the impacts of exposure. Exposure can lead to not only acute and lethal impacts, but also physiological sub-lethal and chronic effects, often linked to the annual cycle of fat deposition and withdrawal. Current challenges for bat conservation include collation of a more extensive and standardized database of bat exposure, especially to current use pesticides and emerging contaminants, and better prediction and definition of toxicity end points notably for the sub-lethal effects. Understanding sub-lethal effects will be of greater importance for sustaining populations in the longer-term. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Ecosystems; Histology; Organic chemicals; Pesticides; Tissue; Toxicity; Bats; Brominated flame retardants; Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane; Mortality; Organic contaminant; Organochlorine pesticides; Persistent organic compounds; Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Tissue engineering; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethane; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; beta hexachlorocyclohexane; campheclor; chlordane; chlorphenotane; chlorpyrifos; dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene; dieldrin; endrin; fenvalerate; flame retardant; heptachlor epoxide; hexachlorobenzene; hexachlorocyclohexane; lindane; nonachlor; organic compound; organochlorine pesticide; organotin compound; oxychlordane; pentachlorophenol; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanylsulfonate; permethrin; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polyfluoroalkyl compound; pyrethroid; unclassified drug; annual cycle; bat; concentration (composition); ecosystem service; mortality; organic pollutant; organochlorine; pesticide; population decline; bat; behavior change; bioaccumulation; carcinogenesis; diet; ecosystem; environmental protection; exposure; foraging; immunotoxicity; lipid storage; longevity; metabolism; nonhuman; pollutant; prediction; priority journal; reproductive toxicity; review; risk assessment; species difference; survival; toxicity testing; trend study; Bats; Mortality; Organic contaminants; Pesticides; Animals; Chiroptera; DDT; Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Organic Chemicals; Pesticides; Tissue Distribution"

PFASs, such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and related precursors, have elicited attention from both public and national regulatory agencies, which has resulted in worldwide restrictions on their production and use. Apex predators occupy the top trophic positions in ecosystems and are most affected by the biomagnification behavior of PFASs. Meanwhile, the long lifespans of apex predators also lead to the high body burden of PFASs. The high body burden of PFASs might be linked to adverse health effects and even pose a potential threat to their reproduction. As seen in previous reviews of PFASs, knowledge is lacking between the current stage of the PFAS body burden and related effects in apex predators. This review summarized PFAS occurrence in global apex predators, including information on the geographic distribution, levels, profiles, and tissue distribution, and discussed the trophic transfer and ecotoxicity of PFASs. In the case where legacy PFASs were restricted under international convention, the occurrence of novel PFASs, such as 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) and perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate (PFECHS), in apex predators arose as an emerging issue. Future studies should develop an effective analytical method and focus on the toxicity and trophic transfer behavior of novel PFASs. © 2021",Biochemistry; Cell proliferation; Ecosystems; Health risks; Adverse health effects; International conventions; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Poly and perfluoroalkyl substance (PFASs); Regulatory agencies; Tissue distributions; Geographical distribution; aliphatic hydrocarbon; bioaccumulation; chemical pollutant; chemical substance; ecological impact; ecotoxicology; food web; pollution incidence; predator; trophic level; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; ecosystem; tissue distribution; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Ecosystem; Fluorocarbons; Tissue Distribution

In previous studies, the prenatal exposure levels and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTE) of PFASs have been reported and discussed. Specifically, the binding affinities between PFASs and some transporters were determined, demonstrating that the TTE values of PFASs are highly dependent on their binding behaviors. To summarize primary findings of previous studies and propose potential guidance for future research, this article provides a systematic overview on levels and characteristics of prenatal exposure to PFASs worldwide, summarizes relationships between TTE values and structures of PFASs, and discusses possible transplacental transfer mechanisms, especially for the combination between PFASs and transporters. Given the critical roles of transporters in the transplacental transfer of PFASs, we conducted molecular docking to further clarify the binding behaviors between PFASs and the selected transporters.

Ubiquities and persistence of some PFAS detected in environmental samples (water, soil, air) have attracted much attention and regulatory actions in recent years. This review provides an overview of PFAS use in electronic components; trends in quantities of e-waste generation; PFAS exposure pathways during e-waste handling and processing; reported PFAS in environmental samples and samples of serum, blood, and hair collected from people living near and working at e-waste processing sites. Processes used for manufacturing electronic components (e.g., embedded processes, additive manufacturing) make recycling or materials recovery from discarded electronic units and components very difficult and unfeasible. Exposure during numerous processing steps for materials recovery and scavenging at disposal sites can result in PFAS intake through inhalation, ingestion, and dermal routes. Chemical risk assessment approaches have been continuously evolving to consider chemical-specific dosimetric and mechanistic information. While the metabolic fate of PFAS is not well understood, some PFAS bioaccumulate and bind to proteins (but not to lipids) in biota and humans due to their surface-active characteristics and very low solubility in water and fat. It is difficult to associate the adverse health effects due to exposure to e-waste directly to PFAS as there are other factors that could contribute to the observed adverse effects. However, PFAS have been detected in the samples collected from different environmental compartments (e.g., water, soil, leachate, blood sera, rainwater) at and near e-waste processing sites, landfills, and near electronics and optoelectronics industries indicating that e-waste collection, processing, and disposal sites are potential PFAS exposure locations. Better monitoring of e-waste handling sites and detailed epidemiological studies for at risk populations are needed for assessing potential health risks due to PFAS exposure at these sites. © 2022",organofluorine derivative; fluorocarbon; water; chemical substance; electronic waste; health risk; literature review; performance assessment; pollution exposure; bioaccumulation; e-waste; environmental exposure; health hazard; human; nonhuman; recycling; Review; risk assessment; waste management; electronics; soil; Electronic Waste; Electronics; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Soil; Water

Bleeding control, maintenance of tissue oxygenation with fluid resuscitation, coagulation support, and maintenance of normothermia remain mainstays of therapy for patients with hemorrhagic shock. Although now widely practised as standard in the USA and Europe, shock resuscitation strategies involving blood replacement and fluid volume loading to regain tissue perfusion and oxygenation vary between trauma centers; the primary cause of this is the scarcity of published evidence and lack of randomized controlled clinical trials. Despite enormous efforts to improve outcomes after severe hemorrhage, novel strategies based on experimental data have not resulted in profound changes in treatment philosophy. Recent clinical and experimental studies indicated the important influences of sex and genetics on pathophysiological mechanisms after hemorrhage. Those findings might provide one explanation why several promising experimental approaches have failed in the clinical arena. In this respect, more clinically relevant animal models should be used to investigate pathophysiology and novel treatment approaches. This review points out new therapeutic strategies, namely immunomodulation, cardiovascular maintenance, small volume resuscitation, and so on, that have been introduced in clinics or are in the process of being transferred from bench to bedside. Control of hemorrhage in the earliest phases of care, recognition and monitoring of individual risk factors, and therapeutic modulation of the inflammatory immune response will probably constitute the next generation of therapy in hemorrhagic shock. Further randomized controlled multicenter clinical trials are needed that utilize standardized criteria for enrolling patients, but existing ethical requirements must be maintained. © 2008 BioMed Central Ltd.","adrenomedullin; aminocaproic acid; antifibrinolytic agent; blood derivative; diaspirin crosslinked hemoglobin; estrogen; flutamide; hemoglobin; hemoglobin containing liposome; hemospan; hypertensive factor; maleimide activated polyethylene glycol modified hemoglobin; oxy 0301; oxygenix; perfluorooctyl bromide; polymerized hemoglobin; recombinant blood clotting factor 7a; sodium chloride; tranexamic acid; unclassified drug; age distribution; blood transfusion; clinical trial; disease control; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug fever; drug induced headache; drug safety; flu like syndrome; fluid resuscitation; genetic susceptibility; hemodynamic monitoring; hemorrhagic shock; human; ileus; immunomodulation; medical ethics; multiple organ failure; myalgia; nausea; neurologic disease; nonhuman; outcome assessment; oxygen transport; pathophysiology; patient selection; point of care testing; priority journal; review; risk factor; sex difference; standardization; vasoconstriction; hemorrhagic shock; hospital information system; methodology; Humans; Point-of-Care Systems; Research Design; Shock, Hemorrhagic"

The potential roles of these microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs in oral cancer development, with their attendant involvement in various cellular processes including proliferation, invasion, migration, epithelial–mesenchymal transition and metastasis is gaining credence. An interaction network of HOX-embedded non-coding RNAs was constructed to identify the RNA interaction landscape using the arena-Idb platform and visualized using Cytoscape. The miR-10a was shown to interact with HOXA1, miR-10b with HOXD10, miR-196a1 with HOXA5, HOXA7, HOXB8, HOXC8, HOXD8, and miR-196a2 with HOXA5. The lncRNAs, HOTAIR interacted with HOXC11, HOTAIRM1 with HOXA1 and HOXA4, HOTTIP with HOXA13, HOXA-AS2 with HOXA3, HOXA11-AS with HOXA11 and HOXD-AS1 with HOXB8. Changes in the HOX cluster-embedded non-coding RNAs have implications for prognosis and overall disease survival. Our review aims to analyze the functional significance and clinical relevance of non-coding RNAs within the HOX cluster in the context of oral carcinogenesis. Elucidating these interactions between the non-coding RNAs and HOX genes in oral cancer development and progression could pave the way for the identification of reliable biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

That is, especially in countries where an abundance of chemicals called endocrine disruptors has repeatedly been reported, both in the environment and in human matrices. Human exposure to persistent and non-persistent chemicals is ubiquitous and associated with endocrine-disrupting effects. This group of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) can act as agonists or antagonists of hormone receptors and can thus significantly affect a number of physiological processes. It can even negatively affect human reproduction with an impact on the development of gonads and gametogenesis, fertilization, and the subsequent development of embryos. The negative effects of endocrine disruptors on sperm gametogenesis and male fertility in general have been investigated and repeatedly demonstrated in experimental and epidemiological studies. Male reproduction is affected by endocrine disruptors via their effect on testicular development, impact on estrogen and androgen receptors, potential epigenetic effect, production of reactive oxygen species or direct effect on spermatozoa and other cells of testicular tissue. Emerging scientific evidence suggests that the increasing incidence of male infertility is associated with the exposure to persistent and non-persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as bisphenols and perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFAS). These chemicals may impact men’s fertility through various mechanisms. This study provides an overview of the mechanisms of action common to persistent (PFAS) and nonpersistent (bisphenols) EDC on male fertility. © Copyright © 2021 Ješeta, Navrátilová, Franzová, Fialková, Kempisty, Ventruba, Žáková and Crha.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; androstanolone; endocrine disruptor; estrogen receptor; gonadotropin; luteinizing hormone; perfluoroalkyl substance; pregnenolone; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; acrosome; apoptosis; biosynthesis; biotransformation; blood testis barrier; cell membrane permeability; DNA damage; DNA fragmentation; DNA methylation; drug mechanism; epigenetics; exposure; gametogenesis; histone methylation; human; male; male fertility; nonhuman; oxidative stress; phosphorylation; reproduction; Review; spermatozoon; spermatozoon motility; steroidogenesis; testis development"

Additionally, the inequity in environmental exposures has yet to be remedied. Exposure to EDCs due to structural racism poses an unequivocal risk to marginalized communities.

Despite having similar physicochemical properties, enantiomers may differ in their interactions with enzymes, receptors and other chiral molecules leading to different biological response. Their differences in bio-degradation, transformation or accumulation should be carefully considered when assessing health risks since they can affect living organisms in a different way. This work reviews the behavior of several groups of environmentally relevant chiral contaminants including pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, perfluoroalkyl substances, brominated flame retardants, pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls and their main metabolites. The enantioselectivity and fate of these compounds in: i) wastewater treatment plants, ii) aquatic and terrestrial environments; and iii) living organisms is discussed. It cannot be predicted whether each specific enantiomer of a chiral compound will be preferably enriched or degraded. The extent of stereoselectivity is associated to several factors, including the specific chiral pollutant, the environmental matrix, the treatment technology used, as well as the season and local environmental factors (pH, soil texture, porosity, organic amended), which are in turn influenced by the activity of the microbial communities.

Howbeit, the current literature lacks a comprehensive and comparative overview of the various degradation pathways and mechanisms. This systematic review compiles and analyzes the mechanisms and degradation pathways of PFAS by persulfate activation, photocatalysis, UV/sulfite, electron beam, electrochemical oxidation, plasma, ozonation, and sonochemical oxidation. We found that the degradation pathways of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and Perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids (PFSAs) were investigated more than any other PFAS. This review implies that the defluorination and degradation pathways of PFAS are reliant on the type of dominant reactive oxidant or reductive species. For instance, holes usually oxidize PFAS to unstable perfluoroalkyl radicals accompanied by losing head groups, whereas hydroxyl and superoxide radicals cleave C–C and C-F bonds. On the other hand, hydrated electrons directly eliminate the head group followed by releasing CF2 units. Furthermore, the imposed crystal facets and functional groups of the introduced catalytic surfaces in the case of heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., photocatalysts) affected the degradation pathways and defluorination rates by anchoring PFAS molecules from the head groups (e.g., carboxylate and sulfonate group). This study lays the groundwork for future research to analyze and elucidate the transformation products and pathways of PFAS in various treatment systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Carboxylation; Catalysis; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Advanced Oxidation Processes; AOP; Critical review; Defluorination; Degradation pathways; Head groups; Oxidation and reduction; Perfluoroalkyl substances; PFOA; Reduction process; Electrochemical oxidation

Therefore, we have designated norharman as a ""co-mutagen"". Since, humans are simultaneously exposed to norharman and aromatic amines in daily life, it is important to clarify the mechanisms of its co-mutagenic action to further understanding of the potential genotoxic effects in humans. Regarding the mechanisms of this action of norharman with aniline, a mutagenic compound, 9-(4′-aminophenyl)-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole[aminophenylnorharman (APNH)] is produced by their interaction, and converted to the hydroxyamino derivative which eventually forms the DNA adduct, dG-C8-APNH through possible ultimate reactive forms with esterification, and this induces mutations. Also other aminophenyl-β-carboline compounds, such as 9-(4′-amino-3′- methylphenyl)-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole[amino-3′-methylphenylnorharman (3′-AMPNH)], 9-(4′-amino-2′-methylphenyl)-9H-pyrido[3,4-b] indole [amino-2′-methylphenylnorharman (2′-AMPNH)], 9-(4′-aminophenyl)-1-methyl-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole[aminophenylharman (APH)] and 9-(4′-amino-3′-methylphenyl)-1-methyl-9H-pyrido[3,4-b] indole[amino-3′-methylphenylharman (AMPH)], have been found on reaction of norharman or harman with aniline or toluidine isomers. These compounds showed mutagenic and clastogenic actions in bacterial and mammalian cells. Among them, APNH demonstrated the most potent activity, and it was most extensively studied. When APNH was administered as a single dose to F344 rats, severe testicular toxicity was observed after 6 days. Moreover, liver preneoplastic lesions (GST-P-positive foci) in the liver clearly developed in animals fed 10-50ppm of APNH in the diet for 4 weeks. Since, APNH was detected in 24h urine of rats upon simultaneous administration with norharman and aniline by gavage, it is likely to be also produced from norharman and aniline in the human body. From these findings, it is suggested that aminophenyl-β-carboline derivatives may be classified as one of the novel types of endogenous mutagens and carcinogens. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Bacteria; Carcinogens; Cells; DNA; Esterification; Mutagens; Tobacco; Clastogenic actions; Norharman; Amines; 9 (4' amino 2' methylphenyl) 9h pyrido[3,4 b]indole(amino 2' methylphenylnorharman); 9 (4' amino 3' methylphenyl) 1 methyl 9h pyrido[3,4 b]indole(amino 3' methylphenylharman); 9 (4' amino 3' methylphenyl) 9h pyrido[3,4 b]indole(amino 3' methylphenylnorharman); 9 (4' aminophenyl) 1 methyl 9h pyrido[3,4 b]indole(aminophenylharman); 9 (4' aminophenyl) 9h pyrido[3,4 b]indole(aminophenylnorharman); aniline; aromatic amine; beta carboline derivative; cigarette smoke; glutathione transferase; harman; hydroxyamino acid; indole derivative; methyl group; mutagenic agent; phenyl group; tolonium chloride; unclassified drug; bacterial cell; bacterial strain; chemical interaction; chemical reaction; chemical structure; classification; cooking; dietary intake; disease course; DNA adduct; esterification; feeding; food; genotoxicity; human; in vivo study; isomer; liver tumor; mammal cell; metabolism; mutation; nonhuman; priority journal; rat strain; review; Salmonella; Salmonella typhimurium; synthesis; testis; toxicity; urine level; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Mammalia; Salmonella; Salmonella typhimurium; Salmonella typhimurium; Typhimurium"

In this mini-review, we organize these mechanisms into three major proposed pathways of PFAS action—metabolism, endocrine disruption, and epigenetic perturbation—and discuss how these distinct but interdependent pathways may explain many of the proposed pro-carcinogenic effects of the PFAS class of environmental contaminants. Notably, each of the pathways is predicted to be highly sensitive to the dose and window of exposure which may, in part, explain the variable epidemiologic and experimental evidence linking PFAS and cancer. We highlight testicular and prostate cancer as models to validate this concept. © 2022 by the authors.

There has been a continuing level of research into the delivery of oxygen during solid organ preservation with the use of PFCs. The one-and two-layer methods have been used as static storage techniques, proving particularly successful for pancreas preservation. They can also be formulated as an emulsion for continual perfusion or as a simple flush solution. The success of PFCs in organ preservation seems to be somewhat organ and species dependant, and further experimental evidence is needed to establish their application.

However, the physical stability of the LE can substantially be improved with help of suitable emulsifiers that are capable of forming a mono- or multi-layer coating film around the dispersed liquid droplets in such a way to reduce interfacial tension or to increase droplet-droplet repulsion. Depending on the concentrations of these three components (oil-water-emulsifier) and the efficiency of the emulsification equipments used to reduce droplet size, the final LE may be in the form of oil-in-water (o/w), water-in-oil (w/o), micron, submicron and double or multiple emulsions (o/w/o and w/o/w). The o/w type LEs (LE) are colloidal drug carriers, which have various therapeutic applications. As an intravenous delivery system it incorporates lipophilic water non-soluble drugs, stabilize drugs that tend to undergo hydrolysis and reduce side effects of various potent drugs. When the LE is used as an ocular delivery systems they increase local bioavailability, sustain the pharmacological effect of drugs and decrease systemic side effects of the drugs. Thus, the rationale of using LE as an integral part of effective treatment is clear. Following administration of LE through these routes, the biofate of LE associated bioactive molecules are somehow related to the vehicles disposition kinetics inside blood or eyeball. However, the LE is not devoid from undergoing various bio-process while exerting their efficacious actions. The purpose of this review is therefore to give an implication of LE for parenteral and ocular delivering systems. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Since its introduction, and until December 2013, about 700 papers have been published using the QuEChERS technique, according to a literature overview carried out using SciFinder, Elsevier SciVerse, and Google search engines. Most of these papers were dedicated to pesticide multiresidue analysis in food matrices, and this topic has been thoroughly reviewed over recent years. The QuEChERS approach is now rapidly developing beyond its original field of application to analytes other than pesticides, and matrices other than food, such as biological fluids and non-edible plants, including Chinese medicinal plants. Recently, the QuEChERS concept has spread to environmental applications by analyzing not only pesticides but also other compounds of environmental concern in soil, sediments, and water. To the best of our knowledge, QuEChERS environmental applications have not been reviewed so far; therefore, in this contribution, after a general discussion on the evolution and changes of the original QuEChERS method, a critical survey of the literature regarding environmental applications of conventional and modified QuEChERS methodology is provided. The overall recoveries obtained with QuEChERS and other extraction approaches (e.g., accelerated solvent extraction, ultrasonic solvent extraction, liquid/solid extraction, and soxhlet extraction) were compared, providing evidence for QuEChERS higher recoveries for various classes of compounds, such as biopesticides, chloroalkanes, phenols, and perfluoroalkyl substances. The role of physicochemical properties of soil (i.e., clay and organic carbon content, as well as cation exchange capacity) and target analytes (i.e., log KOW, water solubility, and vapor pressure) were also evaluated in order to interpret recovery and matrix effect data. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Chemical analysis; Electrophoresis; Pesticides; Recovery; Search engines; Sediments; Soils; Solvent extraction; Water; Water pollution; Accelerated solvent extraction; Cation exchange capacities; Environmental applications; Environmental pollutants; Physicochemical properties of soils; Quechers; Quick , Easy , Cheap , Effective , Rugged , and Safe; Ultrasonic solvent extraction; Chemical contamination; organic compound; pesticide residue; pollutant; analysis; food contamination; fractionation; isolation and purification; pollutant; procedures; Chemical Fractionation; Environmental Pollutants; Food Contamination; Organic Chemicals; Pesticide Residues"

To complement its ongoing research efforts addressing PFAS contamination, the U.S. EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) commissioned the PFAS Innovative Treatment Team (PITT) to provide new perspectives on treatment and disposal of high priority PFAS-containing wastes. During its six-month tenure, the team was charged with identifying and developing promising solutions to destroy PFAS. The PITT examined emerging technologies for PFAS waste treatment and selected four technologies for further investigation. These technologies included mechanochemical treatment, electrochemical oxidation, gasification and pyrolysis, and supercritical water oxidation. This paper highlights these four technologies and discusses their prospects and the development needed before potentially becoming available solutions to address PFAS-contaminated waste. Implications: This paper examines four novel, non-combustion technologies or applications for the treatment of persistent per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) wastes.

The review focuses on Pd/Cu-catalyzed couplings between unactivated nucleoside bases with aryl halides. It also discusses cross-dehydrogenative arylations and alkenylations as well as other reactions used for modification of nucleoside bases that avoid the use of organometallic precursors and involve direct C-H bond activation in at least one substrate.

In this review, the roles of aquatic plants in the process of PFASs remediation were highlighted. Moreover, there were different underlying mechanisms of PFASs uptake between terrestrial and aquatic plants. On the other hand, a wide range of influencing factors for bioaccumulation and translocation of PFASs within plant compartments are also presented and discussed. In response to exposure of PFASs, corresponding phytotoxic effects has affected the growth and metabolism of plants, which could provide beneficial guides of the phytotoxic tolerance for plant species selection in applications of phytoremediation.

A multitude of racemic oxygen-, nitrogen- and sulfur-containing selectands can be separated without prior derivatization into enantiomers by complexation GC on optically active metal(II) bis[3-(perfluoroacyl)-(1R)-camphorate] selectors. Peak inversion is obtained when the selectors with opposite configuration are employed. Applications pertain to chiral analysis in asymmetric synthesis, enzymatic reactions, pheromone and flavour chemistry. Although the use of enantioselective complexation GC has diminished recently with the advent of modified cyclodextrins in enantioselective GC, the inherent principles of enantiorecognition together with other enantioselective phenomena can be elucidated easily by complexation GC. Using the concept of the retention-increment R′ which allows the distinction between non-enantioselective and enantioselective contributions to retention, concise thermodynamic parameters of enantioselectivity -ΔD,L(ΔG) are accessible.

Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are known as emerging contaminants, widely used by modern society. This objective ensures availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, according to the 2030 Agenda. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) do not always mitigate the presence of these emerging contaminants in effluents discharged into the environment, although the removal efficiency of WWTP varies based on the techniques used. This main subject is framed within a broader environmental paradigm, such as the transition to a circular economy. The research and innovation within the WWTP will play a key role in improving the water resource management and its surrounding industrial and natural ecosystems. Even though bioremediation is a green technology, its integration into the bio-economy strategy, which improves the quality of the environment, is surprisingly rare if we compare to other corrective techniques (physical and chemical). This work carries out a bibliographic review, since the beginning of the 21st century, on the biological remediation of some PPCPs, focusing on organisms (or their by-products) used at the scale of laboratory or scale-up. PPCPs have been selected on the basics of their occurrence in water resources. The data reveal that, despite the advantages that are associated with bioremediation, it is not the first option in the case of the recovery of systems contaminated with PPCPs. The results also show that fungi and bacteria are the most frequently studied microorganisms, with the latter being more easily implanted in complex biotechnological systems (78% of bacterial manuscripts vs. 40% fungi). A total of 52 works has been published while using microalgae and only in 7% of them, these organisms were used on a large scale. Special emphasis is made on the advantages that are provided by biotechnological systems in series, as well as on the need for eco-toxicological control that is associated with any process of recovery of contaminated systems. © 2020 by the authors.",NA

Based on this target error of 25%, a statistical model using z-scores was applied to assess the performance of analytical laboratories for POPs and a number of matrices. Since the second round of these ‘Bi-ennial Global Interlaboratory Assessment on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)’, carried out in 2012/2013, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been included into the proficiency tests. The third round was carried out in 2016/2017. The test materials included test solutions of PFASs analytical standards, the abiotic matrices sediment, air (extract) and water and the biotic matrices fish, human milk and human plasma. The number of laboratories submitting results for PFASs remained quite stable (IL2 = 27 laboratories; IL3 = 29), but there was broader geographic distribution observed in IL3: in addition to the laboratories from Asia and the Western Europe/other groups, two laboratories from Africa participated, two from Central-Eastern Europe and one from the Latin American/Caribbean region. Considering that PFASs were introduced for the first time in round 2, the results were good to reasonable compared to those of a number of other POPs included in the same study. However, it shall also be mentioned that for some matrices and PFASs, the number of laboratories submitting results was too small and the results too scattered to derive a consensus value. This was especially true for the PFOS precursor compounds and the air matrix. Also, laboratories struggle with the analysis of the branched PFOS isomers. These interlaboratory assessments on PFASs gave promising results and demonstrated the importance of proficiency tests in an international environment to generate trust in laboratory results. The need to participate regularly in such intercomparison assessments is highlighted. The results show the current level of PFAS analysis, which varies by laboratory and by matrix rather than per geographic region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Geographical distribution; Isomers; Laboratories; Matrix algebra; Monitoring; Global monitoring; Interlaboratory assessment; LC/MS methods; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Stockholm; Organic pollutants; chemical compound; interleukin 2; interleukin 3; perfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; Africa; Asia; Caribbean; concentration (parameter); Eastern Europe; environmental aspects and related phenomena; geographic distribution; Global interlaboratory assessment; isomer; persistent organic pollutant; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Review; sediment; South and Central America; Western Europe

Special attention has been paid to perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the most extensively investigated PFASs. Although human exposure to PFASs may occur through different pathways, dietary intake seems to be the main route of exposure to these compounds. In 2012, we published a wide revision on the state of the science regarding the concentrations of PFASs in foodstuffs, the human dietary exposure to these compounds, and their health risks. In the present review, we have updated the information recently (2011-2016) published in the scientific literature. As in our previous review, we have also observed considerable differences in the PFASs detected-and their concentrations-in the food items analyzed in samples from a number of regions and countries However, fish and other seafood seem to be the food group in which more PFASs are detected and where the concentrations of these compounds are higher. On the basis of the recommendations of the EFSA on the maximum dietary intakes of PFOS and PFOA, human health risks would not be of concern for nonoccupationally exposed populations, at least in the very limited countries for which recent data are available. ©2017 American Chemical Society.",Health; Health risks; Population statistics; Dietary intakes; Human dietary exposures; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Perfluorooctanoic acid; PFOA; PFOS; Polyfluorinated alkyl substances; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Nutrition; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; analysis; environmental exposure; food contamination; human; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Environmental Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Food Contamination; Humans

The current basis of preservation for transplantation is static cold storage using specific preservation solutions which minimise cellular swelling and membrane pump activity, thus maintaining cellular ATP levels. The current organ shortage and consequent expansion of donor criteria places even greater reliance on minimising graft injury during preservation. This review focuses on current and future advances in preservation technology. The key areas of advance are additives to preservation solutions, alternatives/adjuncts to preservation solutions including perfluorocarbons. A major area of advance is in the modulation of organs during the storage period. This may be achieved by biochemical additives or genetic manipulation. Machine perfusion technology is improving, and this is discussed together with the recent concept of warm (normothermic) perfusion as an alternative means of preservation. The authors provide an overview over the current methods of organ preservation. Cold storage, effective in the short-term is insufficient for marginal organs, does not allow assessment of viability markers, and provokes ischaemic injury. Potential strategies for minimising ischaemic injury include additives to preservation solutions; the two-layer method with perfluorcarbons and UW solution - at present limited to pancreas preservation; organ modulation; organ preconditioning and genetic modification of organs.

Maternal factors during pregnancy including coffee drinking or polydrug use, and malconditions, such as premature rupturing of the membranes or placental abnormalities, were present at higher frequencies in FTE than FTS, although the factors of smoking and light drinking during pregnancy did not differ between them. As an indicator of maldevelopment of the brain, CNS involvement was more frequent and severer in FTE than in FTS. These findings suggest that factors in addition to smoking causing reduction in the gestation period may contribute to CNS involvement. As to the concomitant effects of ethanol and tobacco on maldevelopment of the brain, CNS involvement was highest in the offspring of women who both smoked and drank heavily. In conclusion, based on the concept of FTE in addition to FTS, a causal relationship between prenatal smoking and maldevelopment of the brains of offspring has to be investigated, especially as to factors modifying the effects of tobacco during pregnancy.",NA

It has recently been recognized that advanced oxidation–reduction technologies (AO/RTs) exhibit superior removal performance for these ubiquitous pollutants. However, the detailed mechanisms and product risks have not been well summarized and systematically deciphered. In this mini-review article, the basic operating principles of two typical AO/RTs (electron beam and plasma irradiation) and their reported applications in the abatement of PFASs are described in detail. It is noteworthy that these reductive treatments induced remarkable defluorination efficiency of PFOA and PFOS with the generation of short-chain congeners in water. The reaction mechanisms mainly included desulfonization, decarboxylation, H/F exchange, radical cyclization, and stepwise losses of CF2 groups. Unexpectedly, partial degradation products manifested high potential in triggering acute and chronic aquatic toxicity, genotoxicity, and developmental toxicity. Additionally, high or even increased resistance to biodegradability was observed for multiple products relative to the parent chemicals. Taken together, both electron beam and plasma irradiation hold great promise in remediating PFAS-contaminated water and wastewater, while the secondary ecological risks should be taken into account during practical applications. © 2022 by the authors.

The first section of this overview examines in detail recent techno-economic analyses on the utilization of biomass as a source of syngas for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS). FTS is a highly localized industry, and depends on the sources of syngas available, the products desired, and the demand for co- production of electricity. Where coal or natural gas coexist in the region where biomass is available, economics may favor producing or blending syngas from multiple resources, making biomass-to-liquids a highly complex scenario. Land use management is essential for sustainable biomass production, if used as the carbon source for FTS. The second section discusses FTS mechanisms, reactions and catalysts. Supposing the catalyst surface energy favors CO hydrogenation to FTS products, the sweet spot of FTS, selectivity will depend on the degree of back- donation from the metal. The degree of electron back-donation from the catalyst surface to both adsorbed CO and vinylic intermediates in part controls the FT synthesis product distribution. When the back-donation is sufficient, chain growth favors longer chained linear hydrocarbons (paraffins, alpha olefins, linear alcohols) suitable for upgrading to diesel, jet fuels, lubricants, and waxes. When back-donation is less significant, monomethyl branched hydrocarbons, internal olefins, and oxygenates (esters, acids and ketones) are elevated. Lastly, active supports are discussed for increasing the termination rate to oxygenates and olefins, as are hybrid catalysts that simultaneously carry out FTS and upgrading, often through secondary reactions. The last section provides an overview of the commercial scale reactor designs including the fixed bed, fluidized bed, and slurry bubble column reactor currently used in the FTS process. Economically, FTS is favored at larger scales; however, new compact reactor designs are coming into play aimed at monetizing highly localized (e.g. biomass) and stranded resources (e.g. natural gas). These types of reactors, involving microchannel and heat exchanger designs, must be highly efficient at managing heat, cost-effective, and mobile in order to exploit non-traditional sources of syngas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Biomass; Blending; Bubble columns; Catalyst selectivity; Coal deposits; Cost effectiveness; Economic analysis; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Ketones; Land use; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Olefins; Synthesis gas; Synthesis gas manufacture; Biomass productions; Branched hydrocarbons; Heat exchanger design; Land-use management; Product distributions; Secondary reactions; Slurry bubble column reactors; Techno-Economic analysis; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis

A time-constrained therapeutic window, with the drug to be given within 4.5 h after stroke onset, and lethal side effects associated with delayed treatment, most notably hemorrhagic transformation (HT), limit the clinical use of tPA. Co-administering tPA with other agents, including drug or non-drug interventions, has been proposed as a practical strategy to address the limitations of tPA. Here, we discuss the pharmacological and non-drug approaches that were examined to mitigate the complications—especially HT—associated with delayed tPA treatment. The pharmacological treatments include those that preserve the blood-brain barrier (e.g., atovarstatin, batimastat, candesartan, cilostazol, fasudil, minocycline, etc.), enhance vascularization and protect the cerebrovasculature (e.g., coumarin derivate IMM-H004 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)), and exert their effects through other modes of action (e.g., oxygen transporters, ascorbic acid, etc.). The non-drug approaches include stem cell treatments and gas therapy with multi-pronged biological effects. Co-administering tPA with the abovementioned therapies showed promise in attenuating delayed tPA-induced side effects and stroke-induced neurological and behavioral deficits. Thus, adjunctive treatment approach is an innovative therapeutic modality that can address the limitations of tPA treatment and potentially expand the time window for ischemic stroke therapy. © 2017 by the authors.

It is known that various PFAS are quantifiable in human in blood, but potential adverse health outcomes remain unclear. Sentinel and non-traditional model species are useful to study potential toxicity of PFAS in order to understand the relationship between environmental and human health. Here, we present a critical review of studies on the neurotoxicity of PFAS in sentinel and non-traditional laboratory model systems, including Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode), Dugesia japonica (planarian), Rana pipiens (frogs), Danio rerio and Oryzias melastigma (fish), and Ursus maritimus (polar bears). PFAS have been implicated in developmental neurotoxicity in non-traditional and traditional model systems as well as sentinel species, including effects on neurotransmitter levels, especially acetylcholine and its metabolism. However, further research on the mechanisms of toxicity needs to be conducted to determine if these chemicals are affecting organisms in a similar manner. Overall, findings tend to be similar among the various species, but bioaccumulation may vary, which needs to be taken into account in future studies by quantifying target organ concentrations of PFAS to better compare different species. Furthermore, data on the majority of PFAS is lacking in neurotoxicity testing, and additional studies are needed to corroborate findings thus far. © 2020 by the authors.",acetylcholine; perfluoroalkanoic acid; perfluorobutane sulfonate; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; adverse outcome; Anura; bioaccumulation; Caenorhabditis elegans; drinking; Dugesia japonica; human; motor performance; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; Oryzias melastigma; polar bear; prediction; Rana pipiens; Review; sentinel species; walking; zebra fish

Since fronts are associated with convergent currents and productive fishing grounds, any possible convergence of pollutants at fronts would raise concerns. The focus here is on relatively persistent organic pollutants, POPs, as non-persistent organic pollutants are rarely found in the open ocean. Results from recent cruises in the Atlantic Ocean are examined for POP distributions across ocean fronts in (i) the Canary Current; (ii) the Gulf Stream; and (iii) the Amazon and Rio de la Plata Plumes. Few studies achieved a spatial resolution of 10-20. km, while most had 100-300. km between adjacent stations. The majority of the well-resolved studies measured perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), which seem particularly well suited for frontal resolution. In the NE Atlantic, concentrations of PFCs sharply decreased between SW Europe and NW Africa upon crossing the Canary Current Front at 24-27°N. In the Western Atlantic, the PFC concentrations sharply increased upon entering the Amazon River Plume and Rio de la Plata Plume. In the NW Atlantic, concentrations of several pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are very high in Rhode Island Sound, decreasing to below detection limit in the open ocean. The more persistent and already phased-out polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) displayed elevated concentrations in the Gulf Stream and Rhode Island Sound, thereby highlighting the importance of ocean fronts, along-front currents, and cross-frontal transport for the dispersal of PCBs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Ocean currents; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; River pollution; Atlantic Ocean; Detection limits; Elevated concentrations; Perfluorinated compound (PFCs); Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Spatial resolution; Western Atlantic; Organic pollutants; concentration (composition); oceanic front; organic pollutant; PCB; pollutant transport; river plume; spatial distribution; Amazon River; Atlantic Ocean; Canary Current; Gulf Stream; Rio de la Plata
NA,Environmental contaminants and preeclampsia: a systematic literature review,2018,NA,NA,"Preeclampsia is a medical condition specific to pregnancy characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the woman's urine, indicating kidney damage. It is one of the most serious reproductive conditions, posing substantial risks to the baby and potentially fatal for the mother. The causes of preeclampsia are largely unknown and environmental contaminants merit further investigation. The aim of this review was to determine the association between environmental chemical exposures and preeclampsia. PubMed was searched for articles examining a priori chemical exposures and preeclampsia through April 2018. Studies were included in our review if they included at least 10 cases, evaluated preeclampsia independent of gestational hypertension, and used either measured or modeled exposure assessments. Our review contained 28 investigations examining persistent organic pollutants (POP) (6 studies), drinking water contaminants (1 study), atmospheric pollutants (11 studies), metals and metalloids (6 studies), and other environmental contaminants (4 studies). There were an insufficient number of investigations on most chemicals to draw definitive conclusions, but strong evidence existed for an association between preeclampsia and cadmium (Cd). There is suggestive evidence for associations between nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM)(2.5), and traffic exposure with preeclampsia. There is evidence for an association between preeclampsia and Cd but insufficient literature to evaluate many other environmental chemicals. Additional studies using repeated measures, appropriate biological matrices, and mixtures methods are needed to expand this area of research and address the limitations of previous studies.",NA

Endocrine disruptor chemicals generate transgenerational epigenetic problems, besides being associated with male infertility. Epidemiological data indicate that the increase in reproductive problems in males in the last 50 years is correlated with the increase of endocrine disrupting chemicals in the environment, being associated with a decrease in semen quality and direct effects on spermatozoa, such as alterations in motility, viability and acrosomal reaction, due to the generation of oxidative stress, and have also been postulated as a possible cause of testicular dysgenesis syndrome. Diverse antioxidants, such as C and E vitamins, N-acetylcysteine, selenium and natural vegetable extracts, are among the alternatives under study to counter the effects of endocrine disruptor chemicals.

This recent body of work has led to a better understanding of the current levels and spatial and temporal trends of contaminants in biota, including the marine food species that northern peoples traditionally consume. Compared to other circumpolar countries, concentrations of many organochlorines (OCs) in Canadian Arctic marine biota are generally lower than in the European Arctic and eastern Greenland but are higher than in Alaska, whereas Hg concentrations are substantially higher in Canada than elsewhere. Spatial coverage of OCs in ringed seals, beluga and seabirds remains a strength of the Arctic contaminant data set for Canada. Concentrations of OCs in marine mammals and seabirds remain fairly consistent across the Canadian Arctic although subtle differences from west to east and south to north are found in the proportions of various chemicals. The most significant development since 1997 is improvement in the temporal trend data sets, thanks to the use of archived tissue samples from the 1970s and 1980s, long-term studies using archeological material, as well as the continuation of sampling. These data cover a range of species and chemicals and also include retrospective studies on new chemicals such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers. There is solid evidence in a few species (beluga, polar bear, blue mussels) that Hg at some locations has significantly increased from pre-industrial times to the present; however, the temporal trends of Hg over the past 20-30 years are inconsistent. Some animal populations exhibited significant increases in Hg whereas others did not. Therefore, it is currently not possible to determine if anthropogenic Hg is generally increasing in Canadian Arctic biota. It is also not yet possible to evaluate whether the recent Hg increases observed in some biota may be due solely to increased anthropogenic inputs or are in part the product of environmental change, e.g., climate warming. Concentrations of most ""legacy"" OCs (PCBs, DDT, etc.) significantly declined in Canadian Arctic biota from the 1970s to the late 1990s, and today are generally less than half the levels of the 1970s, particularly in seabirds and ringed seals. Chlorobenzenes and endosulfan were among the few OCs to show increases during this period while ∑HCH remained relatively constant in most species. A suite of new-use chemicals previously unreported in Arctic biota (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), perfluoro-octane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs)) has recently been found, but there is insufficient information to assess species differences, spatial patterns or food web dynamics for these compounds. Concentrations of these new chemicals are generally lower than legacy OCs, but there is concern because some are rapidly increasing in concentration (e.g., PBDEs), while others such as PFOS have unique toxicological properties, and some were not expected to be found in the Arctic because of their supposedly low potential for long-range transport. Continuing temporal monitoring of POPs and Hg in a variety of marine biota must be a priority. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The most commonly detected PFAS, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), has been classified as a persistent and bioaccumulative substance. Similarities in chemical structure and environmental behavior of PFOS and the PFCAs that have been detected in wildlife have generated concerns about the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs. Differences between partitioning behavior of perfluorinated acids and persistent lipophilic compounds complicate the understanding of PFCA bioaccumulation and the subsequent classification of the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs according to existing regulatory criteria. Based on available research on the bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids, five key points are highlighted in this review: (1) bioconcentration and bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids are directly related to the length of each compound's fluorinated carbon chain; (2) PFASs are more bioaccumulative than PFCAs of the same fluorinated carbon chain length; (3) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (perfluorooctanoate (PFO) and shorter PFCAs) are not considered bioaccumulative according to the range of promulgated bioaccumulation, ""B"", regulatory criteria of 1000-5000 L/kg; (4) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less have low biomagnification potential in food webs, and (5) more research is necessary to fully characterize the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains (>7 fluorinated carbons), as PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains may exhibit partitioning behavior similar to or greater than PFOS. The bioaccumulation potential of perfluorinated acids with seven fluorinated carbons or less appears to be several orders of magnitude lower than ""legacy"" persistent lipophilic compounds classified as bioaccumulative. Thus, although many PFCAs are environmentally persistent and can be present at detectable concentrations in wildlife, it is clear that PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (including PFO) are not bioaccumulative according to regulatory criteria. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",Bioaccumulation; Biomagnetism; Structure (composition); Lipophilic compounds; Perfluorinated acids; Esters; carbon; carboxylic acid derivative; organic compound; organic matter; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; sulfonic acid derivative; Bioaccumulation; Biomagnetism; Esters; Structure (composition); bioaccumulation; comparative study; environmental legislation; fluorocarbon; food web; organic sulfur compound; partitioning; persistence; wild population; aquatic species; bioaccumulation; chemical structure; fluorination; food web; organic pollution; review; trophic cascade; wildlife; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Fluorocarbons

In this paper, we have reviewed and summarized the influence of PFAS exposure on health, pointing the quality of evidence, and applied translational techniques to integrate evidence for PFAS policy making. This is the first review where highly referred articles on PFAS used for policymaking by several regulatory agencies were collected and evaluated based on the review guidelines developed by the US National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) review guidelines. Several limitations were observed, including co-exposure to multiple chemicals and limited measurement of primary and secondary outcomes related to specific toxicity. However, data from all the studies provided a moderate to strong level of confidence for link between PFAS exposure and different adverse outcomes. Secondly, for translating the risk to humans, an in-silico model and scaling approach was utilized. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK) was used to calculate the human equivalent dose (HED) from two widely accepted studies and compared with tolerable daily intakes (TDIs) established by various regulatory agencies. Inter-species dose extrapolation was done to compare with human the relevance of dosing scenarios used in animals. Overall, a framework for translation of risk was proposed based on the conclusions of this review with the goal of improving policymaking. The current paper can improve the methodological protocols for PFAS experimental studies and encourage the utilization of in-silico models for translating risk. © 2022 The Authors",alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; animal; computer simulation; pharmacokinetics; pollutant; risk assessment; toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Computer Simulation; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Risk Assessment

Zinc finger proteins are categorized into nine subfamilies based on their conserved Cys and His motifs, including the Cys2/His2-type (C2H2), C3H, C3HC4, C2HC5, C4HC3, C2HC, C4, C6, and C8 subfamilies. Over the past two decades, much progress has been made in understanding the roles of C2H2 zinc finger proteins in plant growth, development, and stress signal transduction. In this review, we focus on recent progress in elucidating the structures, functions, and classifications of plant C2H2 zinc finger proteins and their roles in abiotic stress responses. © Copyright © 2020 Han, Lu, Guo, Qiao, Sui, Qiu and Wang.",NA

The chemical degradation is caused by the chemical reaction between the PFSA membrane and chemical species such as free radicals. Although chemical degradation of the PFSA membrane has been studied by various experimental techniques, the mechanism of chemical degradation relies much on speculations from ex-situ observations. Recent activities applying theoretical methods such as density functional theory, in situ experimental observation, and mechanistic study by using simplified model compound systems have led to gradual clarification of the atomistic details of the chemical degradation mechanism.

These products are also referred to as 'oxygen carriers' or 'oxygen therapeutics'. Blood substitutes are a new generation of oxygen therapeutics and their introduction will redefine treatment approaches in a wide range of medical and surgical practices. There are two major classes of this new generation of oxygen therapeutics; (1) modified haemoglobin solutions, referred to as haemoglobin-based blood substitutes (HBBS) and (2) perfluorocarbon emulsions. Tremendous progress has been made in the past four years with the development of HBBS. In comparison, not much progress has been made in the development of perfluorocarbons as oxygen carriers. In the present review discussion is limited to the development of HBBS. Several types of HBBS have been developed and are in different phases of clinical trials. Free haemoglobin has been crosslinked, conjugated, polymerised or encapsulated to prevent its dissociation into dimers. The stability and purity of HBBS are extremely important in overcoming most of the significant toxicities of these products. Commercial manufacturers have utilised better proprietary formulations and purification technologies, and HBBS developed by these organisations have demonstrated safety in both preclinical and clinical studies. Recent research activities suggest a broad range of therapeutic applications for this new generation of oxygen therapeutics. The introduction of HBBS in critical care medicine will provide a new approach of not only improving perfusion, but also delivering oxygen to tissues.",blood substitute; cyclic gmp; endothelin; fluorocarbon; hemoglobin; nitric oxide; cardiovascular system; drug safety; human; intensive care; review; sepsis; transfusion

This has led to the gradual phase-out from production and commerce of some legacy PFAS. Fluoroalkylether compounds (ether-PFAS) are among the fluorinated alternative chemicals that are beginning to be reported in impacted and background environments. Extensive monitoring activities were conducted since 2015–2019 to bridge knowledge gaps on the environmental fate and effects of ether-PFAS including F-53B (6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate [6:2 Cl-PFAES] and 8:2 Cl-PFAES), Gen-X (hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid [HFPO-DA]), and ADONA (dodecafluoro-3H-4,8-dioxanonanoate). In recent years, advances in nontarget screening using high-resolution mass spectrometry have revealed the identities of other infrequently monitored ether-PFAS. In this critical review, we provide an up-to-date inventory of the structures of ether-PFAS discovered in the recent literature. Their environmental occurrence, fate, and effects are discussed on a comparative perspective with some legacy PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). Information on the methods employed for the quantitative and semi-quantitative analysis of ether-PFAS is also provided, including sample preparation and mass spectrometry analysis, analytical performance, and limitations. In particular, the compiled database of MS/MS fragment ions (n = 111) can be useful in spectrum interpretation of novel ether-PFAS.

Human exposure to PFAS is extensive, and PFAS contamination has been reported in drinking water and food supplies as well as in the serum of nearly all people. The most well-studied member of the PFAS class, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), induces tumors in animal bioassays and has been associated with elevated risk of cancer in human populations. GenX, one of the PFOA replacement chemicals, induces tumors in animal bioassays as well. Using the Key Characteristics of Carcinogens framework for cancer hazard identification, we considered the existing epidemiological, toxicological and mechanistic data for 26 different PFAS. We found strong evidence that multiple PFAS induce oxidative stress, are immunosuppressive, and modulate receptor-mediated effects. We also found suggestive evidence indicating that some PFAS can induce epigenetic alterations and influence cell proliferation. Experimental data indicate that PFAS are not genotoxic and generally do not undergo metabolic activation. Data are currently insufficient to assess whether any PFAS promote chronic inflammation, cellular immortalization or alter DNA repair. While more research is needed to address data gaps, evidence exists that several PFAS exhibit one or more of the key characteristics of carcinogens. © 2020 by the authors.

Specifically, PFC-based treatment modalities have been shown to reduce levels of cytokines, chemokines and other mediators of pulmonary inflammation in a PFC- and, to some extent, concentration-dependent manner. As a result, neutrophil adhesion, accumulation and activation are reduced in PFC-treated animals and in humans undergoing partial liquid ventilation.

PFAS are stable and extremely resistant to degradation, resulting in high persistence throughout the environment as well as in human blood. PFAS consist of a large family of synthetic chemicals, with over 4000 distinct varieties having been identified and around 250 currently being manufactured at globally relevant levels. Numerous epidemiological studies have linked exposure to PFAS with adverse health effects ranging from immunotoxicity, cardiometabolic disease, developmental and reproductive effects, cancer, and recently type 2 diabetes. Several studies have demonstrated associations between serum PFAS concentrations and glycemic indicators of type 2 diabetes including glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR in adolescent and adult cohorts. In addition, some studies have shown positive associations with incident type 2 diabetes and multiple PFAS. However, the link between PFAS exposure and the development of diabetes continues to be a disputed area of study, with conflicting data having been reported from various epidemiological studies. In this mini review we will summarize the current state of the literature linking PFAS to type 2 diabetes and discuss important future directions including the use of more complex mixtures-based statistical analyses.

There is a growing consensus that brain injury, whether it is ischemic, hemorrhagic, or traumatic, leads to dysfunction of the BBB. Changes in BBB function observed after injury are thought to contribute to the loss of neural tissue and to affect the response to neuroprotective drugs. New discoveries suggest that considering the entire gliovascular unit, rather than the BBB alone, will expand our understanding of the cellular and molecular responses to traumatic brain injury (TBI). This review will address the BBB breakdown in TBI, the role of blood-borne factors in affecting the function of the gliovascular unit, changes in BBB permeability and post-traumatic edema formation, and the major pathophysiological factors associated with TBI that may contribute to post-traumatic dysfunction of the BBB. The key role of neuroinflammation and the possible effect of injury on transport mechanisms at the BBB will also be described. Finally, the potential role of the BBB as a target for therapeutic intervention through restoration of normal BBB function after injury and/or by harnessing the cerebrovascular endothelium to produce neurotrophic growth factors will be discussed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",ABC transporter; ABC transporter A1; albumin; atp binding cassette transporter c8; cytokine; fibrinogen; glutamic acid; matrix metalloproteinase; reactive oxygen metabolite; sodium potassium chloride cotransporter; sodium proton exchange protein; thrombin; transforming growth factor beta; unclassified drug; vasculotropin A; blood brain barrier; blood clotting; brain dysfunction; brain edema; cell invasion; cell migration; encephalitis; human; inflammatory cell; leukocyte; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; priority journal; protein function; review; traumatic brain injury

A part of innate immunity, the complement system, is an important player in the induction and progression of atherosclerosis. The accumulation of either oxidized or enzymatically modified LDL—bound to C-reactive protein or not—prompts complement activation leading to the assembly of the terminal complement C5b-9 complex in the atherosclerotic lesion. The sublytic C5b-9 assembly leads to the activation and proliferation of smooth muscle and endothelial cells, accompanied by the release of various chemotactic, pro-adhesion, and procoagulant cytokines from these cells. Response gene to complement (RGC)-32, an essential effector of the terminal complement complex C5b-9, also affects atherogenesis, propelling vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, stimulating endothelial proliferation, and promoting vascular lesion formation. A substantial amount of experimental work has suggested a role for the complement system activation during atherosclerotic plaque formation, with the proximal classical complement pathway seemingly having a protective effect and terminal complement contributing to accelerated atherogenesis.

This has resulted in the ‘re-discovery’ of some older antimicrobials and development of new agents, however resistance has also rapidly emerged to these agents. Areas covered: Here we describe recent developments in resistance to three of the most important last-line antimicrobials for treatment of MDR and XDR Gram negatives: fosfomycin, colistin and ceftazidime-avibactam. Expert commentary: A key challenge for microbiologists and clinicians using these agents for treating patients with MDR and XDR Gram negative infections is the need to ensure appropriate reference methods are being used to test susceptibility to these agents, especially colistin and fosfomycin. These methods are not available in all laboratories meaning accurate results are either delayed, or potentially inaccurate as non-reference methods are employed. Combination therapy for MDR and XDR Gram negatives is likely to become more common, and future studies should focus on the clinical effects of monotherapy vs combination therapy, as well as validation of synergy testing methods. Effective national and international surveillance systems to detect and respond to resistance to these last line agents are also critical. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","avibactam plus ceftazidime; beta lactamase; cell membrane protein; colistin; fosfomycin; polymyxin derivative; porin; protein MurA; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; avibactam, ceftazidime drug combination; azabicyclo derivative; ceftazidime; colistin; fosfomycin; amino acid sequence; antibiotic sensitivity; bacterial gene; bacterial virulence; clinical effectiveness; combination drug therapy; diagnostic accuracy; drug design; drug mechanism; drug surveillance program; Enterobacteriaceae; enzyme inactivation; enzyme modification; epidemiology; fosA gene; gene mutation; general practitioner; Gram negative infection; human; intrinsic activity; laboratory diagnosis; mcr 1 gene; mcr 2 gene; mcr 3 gene; mcr 4 gene; mcr 5 gene; mcr 6 gene; mcr 7 gene; microbiology; monotherapy; multidrug resistance; nonhuman; plasmid; protein targeting; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Review; treatment planning; animal; drug combination; drug effect; Gram negative bacterium; Gram negative infection; isolation and purification; microbial sensitivity test; multidrug resistance; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Azabicyclo Compounds; Ceftazidime; Colistin; Drug Combinations; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Fosfomycin; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests"

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride/perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (POSF/PFOS) had been newly listed in Stockholm Convention in 2009, and short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) and hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) were listed as candidate POPs. Bohai Sea is located in the arms of numbers of industrial cities, the semienclosed location of which makes it an ideal sink of emerging pollutants. In the present paper, latest contamination status of emerging POPs in Bohai Sea was reviewed. According to the literature data, Bohai Sea areas are not heavily contaminated by emerging POPs (PBDE: 0.01-720 ng/g; perfluorinated compounds: 0.1-304 ng/g; SCCPs: 64.9-5510 ng/g; HBCDs: nd-634 ng/g). Therefore, humans are not likely to be under serious risk of emerging POPs exposure through consuming seafood from Bohai Sea. However, the ubiquitous occurrence of emerging POPs in Bohai Sea region might indicate that more work should be done to expand the knowledge about potential risk of emerging POPs pollution. © 2014 Xiaomin Li et al.","hexabromocyclododecane; perfluorooctane; perfluorooctanoic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated naphthalene; organic compound; sea water; water pollutant; bioaccumulation; bioavailability; biota; biotransformation; China; coastal waters; comparative study; developed country; estuary; exposure; food web; geographic distribution; human; hydrophobicity; industrial area; intertidal zone; limit of detection; lipophilicity; nonhuman; organ distribution; persistent organic pollutant; pollutant; review; sea; sea food; seashore; sediment; thermostability; analysis; chemistry; water pollutant; China; Geologic Sediments; Organic Chemicals; Seawater; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The Panel determined in 2012 there was a ‘probable link’ (i.e., more probable than not based on the weight of the available scientific evidence) between PFOA and high cholesterol, thyroid disease, kidney and testicular cancer, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. Objective: Here, former C8 Science Panel members and collaborators comment on the PFOA literature regarding thyroid disorders, cancer, immune and auto-immune disorders, liver disease, hypercholesterolemia, reproductive outcomes, neurotoxicity, and kidney disease. We also discuss developments regarding fate and transport, and pharmacokinetic models, and discuss causality assessment in cross-sectional associations among low-exposed populations. Discussion: For cancer, the epidemiologic evidence remains supportive but not definitive for kidney and testicular cancers. There is consistent evidence of a positive association between PFOA and cholesterol, but no evidence of an association with heart disease. There is evidence for an association with ulcerative colitis, but not for other auto-immune diseases. There is good evidence that PFOA is associated with immune response, but uneven evidence for an association with infectious disease. The evidence for an association between PFOA and thyroid and kidney disease is suggestive but uneven. There is evidence of an association with liver enzymes, but not with liver disease. There is little evidence of an association with neurotoxicity. Suggested reductions in birthweight may be due to reverse causality and/or confounding. Fate and transport models and pharmacokinetic models remain central to estimating past exposure for new cohorts, but are difficult to develop without good historical data on emissions of PFOA into the environment. Conclusion: Overall, the epidemiologic evidence remains limited. For a few outcomes there has been some replication of our earlier findings. More longitudinal research is needed in large populations with large exposure contrasts. Additional cross-sectional studies of low exposed populations may be less informative. © 2020",Cholesterol; Pharmacokinetics; Cross-sectional study; Fate and transport; Hypercholesterolemia; Longitudinal research; Pharmacokinetic model; Pregnancy-induced hypertensions; Scientific evidence; Ulcerative colitis; Diseases; cholesterol; liver enzyme; octanoic acid derivative; perfluoroctanoate; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; environmental fate; enzyme; health impact; immune response; infectious disease; pollutant transport; public health; autoimmune disease; birth weight; cancer risk; environmental exposure; environmental health; genital system disease; health hazard; human; hypercholesterolemia; immune response; immunotoxicity; kidney cancer; liver disease; maternal hypertension; neurotoxicity; Ohio; population research; population size; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; testis cancer; thyroid disease; toxicokinetics; ulcerative colitis; cross-sectional study; female; male; pregnancy; testis tumor; Caprylates; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Male; Ohio; Pregnancy; Testicular Neoplasms

Over 40,000 chemicals are approved for commercial use. The challenge is to prioritize chemicals for biomonitoring that may present health risk concerns. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to prioritize chemicals that may elicit child health effects of interest to ECHO but that have not been biomonitored nationwide and to identify gaps needing additional research. METHODS: We searched databases and the literature for chemicals in environmental media and in consumer products that were potentially toxic. We selected chemicals that were not measured in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. From over 700 chemicals, we chose 155 chemicals and created eight chemical panels. For each chemical, we compiled biomonitoring and toxicity data, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency exposure predictions, and annual production usage. We also applied predictive modeling to estimate toxicity. Using these data, we recommended chemicals either for biomonitoring, to be deferred pending additional data, or as low priority for biomonitoring. RESULTS: For the 155 chemicals, 97 were measured in food or water, 67 in air or house dust, and 52 in biospecimens. We found in vivo endocrine, developmental, reproductive, and neurotoxic effects for 61, 74, 47, and 32 chemicals, respectively. Eighty-six had data from high-throughput in vitro assays. Positive results for endocrine, developmental, neurotoxicity, and obesity were observed for 32, 11, 35, and 60 chemicals, respectively. Predictive modeling results suggested 90% are toxicants. Biomarkers were reported for 76 chemicals. Thirty-six were recommended for biomonitoring, 108 deferred pending additional research, and 11 as low priority for biomonitoring. DISCUSSION: The 108 deferred chemicals included those lacking biomonitoring methods or toxicity data, representing an opportunity for future research. Our evaluation was, in general, limited by the large number of unmeasured or untested chemicals. © 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

IPLNs are benign lesions and do not require follow-up after initial detection. There are indications that IPLNs represent a considerable portion of incidentally found pulmonary nodules seen at high-resolution CT. The reliable and accurate identification of IPLNs as benign nodules may substantially reduce the number of unnecessary follow-up CT examinations. Typical CT features of IPLNs are a noncalcified solid nodule with sharp margins; a round, oval, or polygonal shape; distanced 15 mm or less from the pleura; and most being located below the level of the carina. The term perifissural nodule (PFN) was coined based on some of these characteristics. Standardization of those CT criteria are a prerequisite for accurate nodule classification. However, four different definitions of PFNs can currently be found in the literature. Furthermore, there is considerable variation in the reported interobserver agreement, malignancy rate, and prevalence of PFNs. The purpose of this review was to provide an overview of what is known about PFNs. In addition, knowledge gaps in defining PFNs will be discussed.

The A2B subtype is a low affinity receptor, which couples to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and also leads to a rise in intracellular calcium modulating important physiological processes. Adenosine exhibiting activity at this subtype is at concentrations greater than 10 μM. The A2B receptors show a ubiquitous distributions, the highest levels are present in ceeum, colon and bladder, followed by blood vessels, mast cells and lung. Through A2B receptors, adenosine also regulates the growth of smooth muscle cell populations in blood vessels, cell growth, intestinal function, inhibition of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α), vascular tone, and inflammatory processes such as diarrhea and asthma. Potent and selective adenosine agonists are the result of modifications of the parent ligand adenosine by substitution, namely at N6 or C2 position of the purine heterocycle or at the 5′ position of the ribose moiety. 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosina (NECA) is one of the most potent A2B adenosine receptor agonist,.

Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and thyroid outcomes during the early stages of life. We aimed to review this evidence. Methods We conducted a systematic review in compliance with the PRISMA Statement (search conducted in PubMed and Embase, as well as in the citations of the selected articles). We chose studies if they dealt with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin (T4), or thyroid dysfunctions, and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measured in the blood of pregnant women and/or children up to 19 years old. Results We included in this review three cross-sectional, one case-control, and six cohort studies (publication: 2011–2015), focusing on prenatal life (n = 7), childhood (n = 2) or both periods (n = 1). We observed a high degree of heterogeneity across studies in terms of sampling time (different gestational weeks, at birth, or childhood), outcomes, adjustment for potential confounders, and statistical approach. We found some evidence of a positive association between PFHxS and PFOS exposure and TSH levels measured in maternal blood, and PFNA and TSH levels measured in the blood of boys aged ≥ 11 years. Conclusion Although there is a small number of studies with comparable data, we found some consistency of a positive association between maternal or teenage male exposure to some PFAS and TSH levels based on the current literature. However, further studies are required to confirm these possible relationships. © 2016 The Authors",Hormones; Sampling; Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS); Perfluorononanoic acids; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Prenatal and infant exposure; Thyroid; Blood; liothyronine; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; thyrotropin; thyroxine; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perflexane; blood; child health; cohort analysis; epidemiology; pollution exposure; pregnancy; sulfonate; womens health; birth; case control study; childhood; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; data base; epidemiological data; exposure; human; maternal blood; pregnant woman; prenatal period; Review; systematic review; thyroid disease; thyroid function; thyroid hormone blood level; adolescent; child; drug effects; environmental exposure; female; male; pollutant; pregnancy; thyroid gland; toxicity; Adolescent; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Child; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Male; Pregnancy; Thyroid Gland

Neurotoxicity has been recognized as a major public health problem. The Chinese government, research institutes, and scientists conducted extensive studies concerning the source, characteristics, and mechanisms of neurotoxicants. Objectives: This paper presents, for the first time, a comprehensive history and review of major sources of neurotoxicants, national bodies/legislation engaged, and major neurotoxicology research in China. Methods: Peer-reviewed research and pollution studies by Chinese scientists from 1991 to 2015 were examined. PubMed, Web of Science and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were the major search tools. Results: The central problem is an increased exposure to neurotoxicants from air and water, food contamination, e-waste recycling, and manufacturing of household products. China formulated an institutional framework and standards system for management of major neurotoxicants. Basic and applied research was initiated, and international cooperation was achieved. The annual number of peer-reviewed neurotoxicology papers from Chinese authors increased almost 30-fold since 2001. Conclusions: Despite extensive efforts, neurotoxicity remains a significant public health problem. This provides great challenges and opportunities. We identified 10 significant areas that require major educational, environmental, governmental, and research efforts, as well as attention to public awareness. For example, there is a need to increase efforts to utilize new in vivo and in vitro models, determine the potential neurotoxicity and mechanisms involved in newly emerging pollutants, and examine the effects and mechanisms of mixtures. In the future, we anticipate working with scientists worldwide to accomplish these goals and eliminate, prevent and treat neurotoxicity. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Traditionally, PFASs are produced via two major manufacturing processes: electrochemical fluorination (ECF) and telomerization. Due to their persistence, toxicity and bioaccumulation, ECF-associated chemicals perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (POSF) are placed into the Annex B of the Stockholm Convention (SC) on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in 2009. The ECF production has also been phased out gradually in the developed countries. However, the production of fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) by telomerization has increased significantly. Recent studies have demonstrated that the biotransformation and abiotic transformation of FTOHs yielded perfluocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), which may be router for the ubiquitous distribution of PFCAs. Besides, some of the FTOHs intermediate metabolites have been demonstrated to be able to covalently bind with various biomolecules and thereby cause serious toxicity, while the final metabolites are showed to cause hepatotoxicity and renal toxicity. Recently, the environmental problems related to FTOHs have become the hotspots in environmental science, toxicology and epidemiology. This paper reviews the research progress on the production status, environmental occurrence, and the toxicities of FTOHs and the related metabolites. Finally, the currently existing problems and trends are discussed. © 2016, Editorial Office of Progress in Chemistry. All right reserved.",NA

At present, many prominent groups are dedicating significant resources to tailoring and optimising the performance of potential contrast agents. Whilst 1H MRI has become an indispensable tool for the imaging of disease states, it frequently suffers from low contrast owing to background signal from intrinsic 1H. As a result, increasing attention is being directed at compounds containing 19F as this nucleus has a similar NMR sensitivity to 1H and, importantly, intrinsic 19F signals are virtually undetectable in vivo. For several decades, perfluorinated molecules (in which all of the C-H bonds in the parent molecule have been replaced with C-F bonds) and highly fluorous gases such as SF 6 have traditionally been used for these kinds of investigations and there have been some excellent reviews of these compounds and their applications. However, recently 19F imaging is showing signs of evolution, particularly as there have been several reports of fluorinated responsive (smart) agents, micelles, dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers being investigated as targets for 19F-MRI. Furthermore, examples of multimodal contrast agents containing 19F nuclei are also starting to emerge.

The metabolism of compounds commonly found in living things is limited to several thousand metabolites whereas ∼100 million chemical substances have been devised by chemical synthesis, and ∼100 000 are used commercially. Since most of those compounds are not natively found in living things, and some are toxic or carcinogenic, the question arises as to whether there is some organism somewhere with the enzymes that can biodegrade them. Repeatedly, anthropogenic chemicals have been denoted 'non-biodegradable,' only to find they are reactive with one or more enzyme(s). Enzyme reactivity has been organized into categories of functional group transformations. The discovery of new functional group transformations has continually expanded our knowledge of enzymes and biodegradation. This expansion of new-chemical biodegradation is driven by the evolution and spread of newly evolved enzymes. This review describes the biodegradation of widespread commercial chemicals with a focus on four classes: polyaromatic, polychlorinated, polyfluorinated, and polymeric compounds. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons include some of the most carcinogenic compounds known. Polychlorinated compounds include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and many pesticides of the twentieth century. Polyfluorinated compounds are a major focus of bioremediation efforts today. Polymers are clogging landfills, killing aquatic species in the oceans and increasingly found in our bodies. All of these classes of compounds, each thought at one time to be non-biodegradable, have been shown to react with natural enzymes. The known limits of enzyme catalysis, and hence biodegradation, are continuing to expand. © 2020 The Author(s).

It presents desirable characteristics for biomonitoring, including being sessile, widely distributed and abundant, and is a filter-feeder able to accumulate several classes of pollutants (e.g., metals, hydrocarbons, among others). Mussels’ biological responses to pollution exposure can be measured as biomarkers, which include alterations ranging from molecular to physiological levels, to estimate the degree of environmental contamination and its effects on biota. This full review compiles two decades (2000–2020) of literature concerning biological effects on P. perna mussel caused by environmental pollutants (i.e., metals, hydrocarbons, and emerging pollutants), considering environmental and farm-based biomonitoring. Biochemical markers related to mussels’ oxidative status were efficient for the biomonitoring of metals (i.e., antioxidant enzymes associated with oxidative damage in biomolecules). Genotoxicity and cytotoxicity indicators (i.e., comet, micronucleus, and neutral red assays) provided a depiction of hydrocarbon contamination. The neutral red assay gave a time-concentration cytotoxic response to a wide range of pollutants, including emerging pollutants (e.g., pharmaceuticals and biocides) and hydrocarbons. Perna perna hemocyte parameters provided a useful approach for biocide biomonitoring. This paper summarizes useful biomarkers from molecular to physiological levels in this mussel species used to identify and quantify the degree of coastal pollution. An integrated biomarker analysis may provide a way to overcome possible biomarker variations and assess multi-polluted sites. Nevertheless, it is necessary to investigate biomarker variations according to natural factors (e.g., season and gonad maturation stage) to standardize them for trustworthy biomonitoring. © 2021","Biocides; Hydrocarbons; Marine pollution; Molecular biology; Molluscs; Physiological models; Physiology; Tropics; Biochemical markers; Emerging pollutants; Environmental contamination; Environmental pollutants; Environmental pollutions; Hydrocarbon contamination; Physiological levels; Pollution biomarkers; Biomarkers; biomarker; biomonitoring; environmental conditions; heavy metal; hydrocarbon; mussel culture; oxidative stress; seasonal variation; species diversity; Perna perna; biological marker; analysis; animal; environmental monitoring; Perna; pollution; toxicity; water pollutant; Animals; Biomarkers; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Perna; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

They are arguably connected with the active phase in iron-based Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS). In FTS, different phases of iron carbide have been identified, including Hägg carbide (χ-Fe5C2), pseudo-hexagonal iron carbide (ἐ-Fe2.2C), hexagonal iron carbide (ɛ-Fe3C), cementite (θ-Fe3C), and Eckstrom-Adcock iron carbide (Fe7C3). However, despite decades of existence of FTS technology, the exact roles played by carbide phases have been the subject of intense debate due to the complex and dynamic nature of carbide phases. This drawback usually frustrates the establishment of a clear-cut structure-perfomance relationship. In light of these concerns, it is very imperative to critically review the challenges and various approaches aimed at demystifying their roles and improving their performance in FTS for sustainable production of clean fuels. First, the structures and essential properties of iron carbides were evaluated and recent research advances in the synthesis of iron carbides were discussed and compared. Second, the structural elucidations of carbide phases using in situ studies, their performances and thermodynamic stability in FT reaction were discussed. Finally, outlooks on future research directions are outlined. This review provides insights into understanding the evolution and performance of carbide phases in FTS, and motivating researchers to further contribute towards designing iron-based FTS catalysts with highly active and selective carbide phase as the predominant phase. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Fuels; Iron compounds; Carbide phasis; Fe$+3+$; Fischer Tropsch; Hagg carbide; Iron carbides; Iron-based; Performance; Structure and performance; Structure-performance relationship; Tropsch synthesis; Carbides

Plasma volume expanders are well known in clinical practice. The main subject of this paper is the complex area of red cell substitutes with particular reference to the oxygen carrying capacity. The history of blood oxygen carrying capacity is briefly presented with particular reference to contributions by G. S. Adair, C. Bohr, M. Perutz and R. R. Benesch. 3 oxygen carrying developments are discussed in detail: 1) perfluorocarbons 2) artificial red cells 3) stroma-free haemoglobin solution Perfluorocarbons were used as carriers of oxygen in experiments and clinical practice. Before their wide clinical application a number of potential problems must be solved. In selected patients (coronary angioplasty, cerebral thrombosis, cardiopulmonary by-pass) perfluorocarbons (Fluosol D-A) could be considered as beneficial. Artificial red cells (neohaemocytes) are available in some centres in which progress of micro-technology appears to lead to encapsulation of purified human haemoglobin. These preparations should receive more attention. Finally stroma-free haemoglobin solution was the subject of our own research for several years. Our preparation met the requirements of the blood substitute, but had the short half-life in the circulation. Recent advances in chemistry in some centres resulted in the modification of hb molecule and linking with P-5-P. The modified poly hb solution is an ideal oxygen delivering fluid.",blood substitute; oxygen; comparative study; human; metabolism; review; Blood Substitutes; Humans; Oxygen

Using the Great Lakes Initiative, water concentrations of PFOS were calculated to protect aquatic plants and animals. The screening plant value (SPV) protective of aquatic algae and macrophytes was calculated as 2.3mg PFOS/L. The secondary chronic value protective of aquatic organisms was 1.2μg PFOS/L. The screening-value water concentrations less than or equal to 1.2μg PFOS/L would not pose a potential risk to aquatic organisms. Because the aquatic benchmark is based on the most sensitive species, this benchmark should also be protective of other aquatic organisms, including amphibians. The tissue-based TRV for fish was determined to be 87μg PFOS/kgww. For terrestrial plants, a screening benchmark was determined to be 1.3 mg PFOS/kg soil ww or 1.5 mg PFOS/kg soil dw, whereas for soil invertebrates such as earthworms the benchmark value was 39mg PFOS/kgdw soil or 33mg PFOS/kgww soil. For avian species, dietary, ADI, and egg yolk-based benchmarks were determined as 0.28 mg PFOS/kg diet, 0.021mg PFOS/kg bw/d, and 1.7μg PFOS/mL yolk, respectively. Benchmarks for serum and liver for the protection of avian species were 1.0μg PFOS/mL and 0.6μg PFOS/gww, respectively. However, no-effect levels in laboratory studies suggest actual population-level effects would not be expected to occur until a concentration of 6.0 mg PFOS/kg in the diet, 5.0μg PFOS/gww in the liver, or 9.0μg PFOS/mL in the serum was exceeded, thus indicating the conservative nature of the benchmarks. © Springer 2006.","alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctane sulfonic acid; animal; bird; chemistry; fish; human; plant; review; soil pollutant; water pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Birds; Fishes; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Plants; Soil Pollutants; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Although the majority of studies on C8-dG adducts have focused on lesions containing a C8-N-C tether between the bulky moiety and the nucleobase, the formation of O-linked lesions with a similar tether topology and C-linked adducts involving direct C8-C connectivity have also been uncovered. Several studies have been done to try to better understand the structural impact and mutagenicity of O-linked and C-linked aryl C8-dG adducts, including lesions arising from unsub-stituted and chloro-substituted phenols and the food mutagen ochratoxin A (OTA). Information about the structural preferences of the adducts in duplexes containing the NarI sequence has been gained from optical spectroscopy (UV-vis, CD, and fluorescence), 19F NMR spectroscopy, and computational chemistry (density functional theory calculations at the nucleobase, nucleoside, and nucleotide levels and molecular dynamics simulations of adducted duplexes). The replication of select adducts has also been investigated using primer-elongation assays, and model high-fidelity and Y-family polymerases. Although the (unsubstituted) O-linked phenoxy-dG adduct preferentially induces a single duplex conformation and is replicated as per natural dG, chloro substitution blocks DNA replication. In contrast, the unsubstituted C-linked phenyl-dG adduct induces mismatches, while the C-linked ortho- and para-phenoxy-dG lesions lead to conformational heterogeneity of adducted DNA indicative of strong mutagenic potential. Finally, the C-linked OTA-derived lesion exhibits the greatest conformational flexibility in duplexes, which provides structural explanations for observed outcomes in OTA-exposed cells. Overall, the variation in the conformational preferences of DNA containing O-linked and C-linked aryl-dG adducts highlights the fact that the type of C8 linkage, the presence and location of functional groups in the bulky moiety, the adduct ionization state, and the sequence context can have profound effects on the conformational outcomes of adducted DNA, which directly dictate the activity of the original toxin. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","2,4,6 trichlorophenol; chlorophenol; deoxyguanosine; DNA; double stranded DNA; guanine; nucleic acid base; nucleoside; nucleotide; ochratoxin; pentachlorophenol; phenol derivative; DNA adduct; guanine; mutagenic agent; carcinogenicity; conformational transition; density functional theory; DNA adduct; DNA conformation; DNA damage; DNA replication; DNA structure; DNA synthesis; human; hydrogen bond; ionization; molecular dynamics; mutagenicity; nucleotide sequence; Review; animal; chemistry; mutagenesis; Animals; Deoxyguanosine; DNA Adducts; Guanine; Humans; Mutagenesis; Mutagens; Ochratoxins"

The active core of ghrelin is highly conserved among vertebrates, suggesting its biological activity to be also conserved. In fish, both acylated forms of ghrelin have been identified; however, the ratio of the ghrelin-C8 to ghrelin-C10 is not as great as observed in mammals. In the tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), ghrelin-C10 is the major form of ghrelin. Since fish are known to inhabit every ecological niche on earth, studies on fish have provided valuable insight into vertebrate physiology in general; it is likely that understanding the role of both acylated forms of ghrelin, in more detail, in fish will result into novel insights in the biology of ghrelin within vertebrates. In this paper we discuss ghrelin's role in regulating appetite and metabolism in fish, in general, and provide evidence that the two tilapia ghrelins exhibit different biological roles. © 2010 Sara E.

The monitoring of these compounds is difficult because the detection limits of the majority of the available analytical methods cannot achieve the very low target concentrations required to meet proposed environmental quality criteria. In 2014, a combined Science-Policy Interface/Chemical Monitoring of Emerging Pollutants project was launched to meet this monitoring challenge. The project involved 24 research organizations and environmental agencies from 12 different countries. Methods: Sixteen surface water (SW) and 17 wastewater (WW) samples were collected across Europe and analysed using five in vitro effect-based and three chemical analytical methods. A general description of the project and data evaluation is provided by Könemann and colleagues in the companion publication 2018. In our study, we compared bioanalytical and chemical analytical results with regard to their application for aquatic status assessment. Therefore we considered the potential to predict population-relevant risks for aquatic organisms and the specificity and sensitivity of the various methods used in both approaches. Finally, we tested and discussed the applicability and relevance of previously suggested effect-based trigger values (EBT). Results and discussion: Results of the risk assessment based on chemical analytical data correlated highly with estrogenic activities (expressed as 17β-estradiol equivalents (EEQ) determined using effect-based methods), demonstrating the ability of the bioassays to predict the mixture risk caused by steroidal estrogens. For about 15% of SW and 40% of WW samples detection limits of chemical-analytical methods were too high to allow a status assessment, while detection limits of all effect-based methods were below proposed EBT. This demonstrates that effect-based methods are suitable for status assessment of surface waters. The in vitro effect-based methods were quite specific for steroidal estrogens and highly sensitive, meaning they have a low probability to detect false positive or negative results. After testing of three alternative EBT proposals, we concluded to use preliminary 400 pg/L EEQ as screening EBT corresponding to the AA-EQS of E2. Further test specific refinements in the application of this value are not excluded. Conclusions: We conclude that water quality assessment can progress from a purely analytical approach to effect-based monitoring, from single substance to known and unknown mixture assessment and from in vitro screening to population-relevant risk assessment. Despite a few limitations, effect-based in vitro methods are recommendable for monitoring steroidal estrogens under the WFD because they, a) are able to sensitively quantify the activity of steroidal estrogens in all surface and wastewater samples, b) are able to detect the combined effect of estrogen mixtures including unknown chemicals with estrogen receptor activating properties, c) allow an ecotoxicological status assessment using EBT to calculate risk quotients. This approach is similar to the risk ratio used in regulatory environmental risk assessments, but allows for an integrated mixture assessment. Outlook: The results of this study support the introduction of a holistic approach for the regulation of chemicals in the aquatic environment under the EU WFD, as proposed recently by EU Water Directors. An ecotoxicological status assessment for one of the most relevant modes of action of endocrine disruption will allow authorities responsible for water quality assessment to focus available monitoring resources and to improve the ecological status of EU waterbodies. © 2018 Swiss Centre for Applied Ecotoxicology Eawag/EPFL",Aquatic organisms; Chemical detection; Endocrine disrupters; Environmental regulations; Mixtures; Monitoring; Pollution detection; Risk management; Surface waters; Watches; Water conservation; Water pollution; Water pollution control; Water quality; Effect-based methods; Emerging pollutants; Endocrine disruption; Oestrogens; Risk-based; Science - policy interfaces; Watch list; Water Framework Directives; Risk assessment; 17alpha ethinyl estradiol; estradiol; estrogen; estrone; surface water; unclassified drug; analytic method; aquatic environment; bioassay; controlled study; ecotoxicity; environmental monitoring; Europe; false negative result; false positive result; in vitro study; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; risk management; sensitivity and specificity; waste water; water quality

These new compounds, hereafter referred to as emerging PFASs, continue to be discovered and are now showing ubiquity in abiotic and biotic environments. Thus, there is an urgent need for robust, yet sensitive analytical methods to determine their occurrence and understand their behavior, fate, impact, and toxicity. Here, we review the up-to-date sample preparation and analytical methodologies for emerging PFASs based on peer-reviewed literature published in the past three years (2015–2018). The determination of emerging PFASs is similar to that of legacy PFASs, with satisfactory performances for most emerging PFASs achieved using conventional extraction and analytical approaches. However, the determination of certain specific analytes remains challenging due to the unavailability of standards and reference materials, low recoveries and matrix effects, background contamination, and poor sensitivities due to in-source fragmentation. Despite recent progress in identifying ionic semi-volatile PFASs with liquid chromatograph-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), our knowledge on new types of neutral volatile PFASs remains poor due to limited non-target analysis using gas chromatograph (GC)-HRMS. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Extraction; Mass spectrometry; Emerging contaminant; High resolution mass spectrometry; Non-target screenings; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Quantification; Triple quadrupole; Liquid chromatography; fluorine derivative; ground water; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; surface water; unclassified drug; airborne particle; analytic method; bioaccumulation; calibration; extraction; human; ion pair liquid extraction; limit of detection; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liquid liquid extraction; mass fragmentography; nonhuman; priority journal; quality control; quantitative analysis; Review; sediment; serum; sludge; soil; solid liquid extraction; solid phase extraction; standard; waste water

One of the reasons probably is the assumption that the aerobic degradation is more energetically favorable than degradation under strictly anaerobic conditions. Certain aerobically recalcitrant contaminants, however, are biodegraded under strictly anaerobic conditions and little is known about the organisms and enzymatic processes involved in their degradation. This review provides a comprehensive survey of characteristic anaerobic biotransformation reactions for a variety of well-studied, structurally rather simple contaminants (SMOCs) bearing one or a few different functional groups/structural moieties. Furthermore it summarizes anaerobic degradation studies of more complex contaminants with several functional groups (CMCs), in soil, sediment and wastewater treatment. While strictly anaerobic conditions are able to promote the transformation of several aerobically persistent contaminants, the variety of observed reactions is limited, with reductive dehalogenations and the cleavage of ether bonds being the most prevalent. Thus, it becomes clear that the transferability of degradation mechanisms deduced from culture studies of SMOCs to predict the degradation of CMCs, such as EOCs, in environmental matrices is hampered due the more complex chemical structure bearing different functional groups, different environmental conditions (e.g. matrix, redox, pH), the microbial community (e.g. adaptation, competition) and the low concentrations typical for EOCs. © 2017 The Authors","Biocides; Biodegradation; Degradation; Dehalogenation; Drug products; Pesticides; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic biodegradation; Complex multifunctional contaminants (CMCs); Emerging organic contaminants; Simple mono- or oligofunctional contaminants (SMOCs); Transformation; Contamination; aldehyde; alkane; alkanol; amine; aromatic compound; azo compound; benzene; carbamazepine; carboxylic acid; diatrizoate; diclofenac; ester; ether; ether derivative; ethylbenzene; glyceryl trinitrate; hydrocarbon; imazosulfuron; metolachlor; o demethylase; perfluoro compound; phenol derivative; polycyclic aromatic compound; polyhalogenated hydrocarbon; sulfamethoxazole; sulfonic acid derivative; toluene; triclosan; trimethoprim; unclassified drug; venlafaxine; waste water; anoxic conditions; aquatic environment; biodegradation; biotransformation; concentration (composition); drug; environmental conditions; microbial community; organic pollutant; pesticide; pollutant removal; water treatment; adaptation; anaerobic metabolism; aquatic environment; biodegradation; biotransformation; chemical bond; dehalogenation; microbial community; organic pollution; oxidation reduction reaction; pH; priority journal; Review; sediment; soil; waste water management; water pollutant; bioremediation; waste water; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biotransformation; Waste Water"

The isolation of a cDNA clone encoding a mannan-binding protein associated serine protease (MASP)-1-like protein from the Japanese dog fish (Triakis scyllia) suggests the presence of a lectin pathway. The CCP consists of six functionally distinct components: C1n, C2n, C3n, C4n, C8n and C9n, and is activated by immune complexes in the presence of Ca++ and Mg++ ions. The ACP is antibody independent, requiring Mg++ ions and a heat-labile 90 kDa factor B-like protein for activity. Proteins considered homologues of C1q, C3 and C4 (C2n) of the mammalian complement system have been isolated from nurse shark serum. Shark C1q is composed of at least two chain types each showing 50% identity to human C1q chains A and B. Partial sequence of the globular domain of one of the chains shows it to be C1q-like rather than like mannan-binding protein. N-terminal amino acid sequences of the α and β chain of shark C3 and C4 molecules show significant identity with corresponding human C3 and C4 chains. A sequence representing shark C4 γ chain, shows little similarity to human C4 γ chain. The terminal shark components C8n and C9n are functional analogues of mammalian C8 and C9.

Despite their unprecedented combination of desirable attributes, PTFE and copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) with hexafluoropropylene and perfluoropropylvinylether are crystalline and exhibit poor solubility in solvents, which makes their processability very challenging.

The region immediately downstream of ftsZ encodes the ylm genes and is conserved across diverse lineages of Gram-positive bacteria and Cyanobacteria. In some organisms, this region remains part of the dcw cluster, but in others, it appears as an independent operon. A well-studied protein coded from this region is the positive FtsZ regulator SepF (YlmF), which anchors FtsZ to the membrane. Recent developments have shed light on the importance of SepF in a range of species. Additionally, new studies are highlighting the importance of the other conserved genes in this neighborhood. In this minireview, we aim to bring together the current research linking the ylm region to cell division and highlight further questions surrounding these conserved genes.

This shift in focus is a result of the rapidly increasing prevalence of ASD coupled with the incomplete penetrance of this disorder in monozygotic twins. One such area of environmentally focused research is the association of exposures to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) with elevated risk for ASD. EDCs are exogenous chemicals that can alter endogenous hormone activity and homeostasis, thus potentially disrupting the action of sex and other natural hormones at all stages of human development. Inasmuch as sex hormones play a fundamental role in brain development and sexual differentiation, exposure to EDCs in utero during critical stages of development can have lasting neurological and other physiological influences on the developing fetus and, ultimately, the child as well as adult. This review will focus on the possible contributions of EDCs to autism risk and pathogenesis by first discussing the influence of endogenous sex hormones on the autistic phenotype, followed by a review of documented human exposures to EDCs and associations with behaviors relevant to ASD. Mechanistic links between EDC exposures and aberrant neurodevelopment and behaviors are then considered, with emphasis on EDC-induced transcriptional profiles derived from animal and cellular studies. Finally, this review will discuss possible mechanisms through which EDC exposure can lead to persistent changes in gene expression and phenotype, which may in turn contribute to transgenerational inheritance of ASD. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; atrazine; chlorphenotane; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1; DNA methyltransferase 3A; estrogen receptor alpha; estrogen receptor beta; organochlorine derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; retinoid related orphan receptor alpha; endocrine disruptor; hormone; autism; brain development; DNA methylation; Dnmt1 gene; Dnmt3a gene; epigenetics; Esr1 gene; Esr2 gene; Esrrg gene; gene; gene expression; homeostasis; hormone action; human; nonhuman; pathogenesis; phenotype; priority journal; Review; risk factor; RORA gene; sex difference; sex differentiation; animal; autism; chemically induced; child; drug effect; environmental exposure; gene expression regulation; genetics; genotype environment interaction; inheritance; physiology; statistics and numerical data; Animals; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene-Environment Interaction; Hormones; Humans; Inheritance Patterns; Risk Factors"

The number of studies in this area has increased; however, presently there is no scientometric perspective addressing this topic. The purpose of this study is to identify the intellectual base and research front using the visualization and analysis software, CiteSpace. We retrieved 453 articles, published in print or online as an early-access article between 2002 and 2020, from the Web of Science with a topic search related to OUVFs, environment, and toxicology. We then analysed synthesized networks of co-authorship (author, institution, country), co-citation (author, document, journal) and co-occurring keywords. The annual publication output has trended upwards since 2002. Authors based in China accounted for 29.4% of the total publications, followed by USA (17.4%); but overall publications from Switzerland and Spain were more influential. Major research themes identified included OUVF concentrations in aquatic environments, and hormonal effects. Emerging themes included improving the sensitivity of analytical detection methods for both OUVFs and their metabolites, consequences of OUVF transport to the marine environment, and concerns over prenatal exposure. Based on keyword analysis, benzophenone-3, 4-methylbenzylidene-camphor, 3-benzylidene camphor, and ethylhexyl-methoxycinnamate are the most studied OUVFs, and effects on estrogenic activity, gene expression, reproduction, and more recently, oxidative stress, have received most attention from a toxicological perspective. Other prominent topics were sources of environmental contamination and ecological risk assessments.

In this review, the compatibilization of ceramic molecular sieves with perfluorinated matrices is considered first, examining the effect of the surface treatment on the gas transport properties of the filler. Then the preparation of the defect-free hybrid membranes and their gas separation capabilities are described. Finally, recent modelling of the gas transport properties of the perfluoropolymer MMMs is reviewed. The systematic use of molecular sieves of different size and shape, either permeable or impermeable, and the calculation of the bulk transport properties of the molecular sieves-i.e., the unrestricted diffusion and permeability-allow to understand the nature of the physical phenomena at work in the MMMs, that is the larger the perfluoropolymer fractional free volume at the interface, and restricted diffusion at the molecular sieves. This knowledge led to the formulation of a new four-phase approach for the modelling of gas transport. The four-phase approach was implemented in the frame of the Maxwell model and also for the finite element simulation. The four-phase approach is a convenient representation of the transport in MMMs when more than one single interfacial effect is present. © 2019 by the authors.

Obesity occurs when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure; however, individuals vary widely in their propensity to gain weight and accrue fat mass, even at identical levels of excess caloric input. Clinical, epidemiological, and biological studies show that obesity is largely programmed during early life, including the intrauterine period. The environmental obesogen hypothesis holds that prenatal or early life exposure to certain endocrine disrupting chemicals can predispose exposed individuals to increased fat mass and obesity. Obesogen exposure can alter the epigenome of multipotent stromal stem cells, biasing them toward the adipocyte lineage at the expense of bone. Hence, humans exposed to obesogens during early life might have an altered stem cell compartment, which is preprogrammed toward an adipogenic fate. This results in a higher steady state number of adipocytes and potentially a lifelong struggle to maintain a healthy weight, which can be exacerbated by societal influences that promote poor diet and inadequate exercise. This review focuses on the developmental origins of the adipocyte, the relationship between adipocyte number and obesity, and how obesogenic chemicals may interfere with the highly efficient homeostatic mechanisms regulating adipocyte number and energy balance. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; ataxin 1; beta1 integrin; CD24 antigen; CD34 antigen; endocrine disruptor; estrogen derivative; hexachlorobenzene; lipid; olanzapine; organotin compound; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; serotonin uptake inhibitor; thyroid hormone; triacylglycerol; tributyltin; tricyclic antidepressant agent; xenobiotic agent; adipocyte; adipogenesis; body fat; body mass; cell differentiation; cell lineage; cell maturation; drug use; energy balance; energy expenditure; epigenetics; health status; homeostasis; human; lipid metabolism; maternal smoking; nonhuman; obesity; prenatal exposure; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; review; side effect; thyroid function; thyroid hormone metabolism; thyroid hormone synthesis; triacylglycerol blood level; white adipose tissue; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Animals; Body Composition; Body Weight; Endocrine Disruptors; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Fetal Development; Humans; Japan; Obesity; PPAR gamma; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Republic of Korea; Stem Cells"

Their widespread use makes them a potential route of exposure for certain contaminants to which human would not be normally exposed. One of these contaminants includes endocrine disrupting chemicals, molecules capable of mimicking the body's natural hormones and interfering with the endocrine system. Some of them are ingredients included in the product's formulation, such as UV-filters (sunscreens), phthalates (plasticizers and preservatives), synthetic musks (fragrances), parabens and other antimicrobial agents (antimicrobial preservatives). Others are non-intended added substances that may result from the manufacturing process or migration from the plastic packaging, as with bisphenols and perfluorinated compounds. Some of these endocrine disruptors have been restricted or even banned in cosmetics and PCPs given the high risk they pose to health. Thus, the development of fast, sensitive and precise methods for the identification and quantification of these compounds in cosmetics is a substantial need in order to ensure consumer safety and provide insight into the real risk of human exposure. The present work aims at reviewing the more recently developed analytical methods published in the literature for the determination of endocrine disrupting chemicals in cosmetics and PCPs using chromatographic techniques, with a focus on sample treatment and the quality of analytical parameters.

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is one of these sources, which converts syngas (a mixture of CO and H2) to a wide range of hydrocarbons. Liquid transportation fuels produced via FTS from biomass-derived syngas introduce an attractive, clean, carbon-neutral, and sustainable energy source. Reactor and catalyst designs play a significant role in the improvement of FTS efficiency. Flow hydrodynamics coupled with reaction kinetics makes this process challenging. Numerical methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can help us effectively understand the fluid dynamics within FT reactor. The main objective of CFD simulation for FTS can be summarized in three points (1) to analyze the conservation laws (mass, heat, and momentum transport) coupled with the catalytic reactions in the reactor, (2) to optimize the operating conditions to maximize the catalytic activity and selectivity to desired products, and (3) to support the reactor design and engineering. A CFD code consists of four steps: geometry generation, meshing, solver, and post-processing. Emerging data-driven techniques were also reviewed in this work to analyze the fluid dynamics of FTS. FTS is mainly operated in fixed bed, slurry bubble column, fluidized bed, micro-structured, and membrane reactors. This review aims to analyze the capability of CFD simulation in predicting the FTS performance in different reactor types and address the present challenges. © Elsevier Ltd",Bioreactors; Computational fluid dynamics; Energy conservation; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Fluidized beds; Numerical methods; Physical properties; Product design; Reaction kinetics; Synthesis gas; Clean energy; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Conservation law; Fluid-dynamics; Global energy demand; Reactor configuration; Reactor designs; Renewable energies; Sustainable energy; Syn gas; Catalyst activity

PFAS have been widely used for many decades, and the persistence and potential toxicity of PFAS are an emerging concern in the world. PFAS exposed via diet can be readily absorbed by the intestine and enter the circulatory system or accumulate directly at intestinal sites, which could interact with the intestine and cause the destruction of intestinal barrier. This review summarizes current relationships between PFAS exposure and intestinal barrier damage with a focus on more recent toxicological studies. Exposure to PFAS could cause inflammation in the gut, destruction of the gut epithelium and tight junction structure, reduction of the mucus layer, and induction of the toxicity of immune cells. PFAS accumulation could also induce microbial disorders and metabolic products changes. In addition, there are limited studies currently, and most available studies converge on the health risk of PFAS exposure for human intestinal disease. Therefore, more efforts are deserved to further understand potential associations between PFAS exposure and intestinal dysfunction and enable better assessment of exposomic toxicology and health risks for humans in the future. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Cardiovascular system; Risk assessment; Toxicity; 'current; Circulatory systems; Gastrointestinal Disease; Intestinal barriers; Intestinal microflora; Microflorae; Natural environments; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Synthetic organic compounds; Health risks; chemical compound; perfluoroalkanoic acid; perfluorodecane sulfonate; perfluoroheptanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonamide; perfluoropentanoic acid; perfluorotridecanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; perpolyfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; organic compound; dietary intake; digestive system disorder; future prospect; health impact; health risk; metabolism; organic compound; pollution effect; pollution exposure; polymer; toxicology; celiac disease; cell structure; chemical parameters; Crohn disease; drug absorption; drug distribution; drug excretion; drug metabolism; drug transport; enteropathy; environmental exposure; environmental impact; gastritis; gastrointestinal toxicity; health hazard; human; immune system; immunocompetent cell; immunotoxicity; intestine epithelium; microbiology; nonhuman; physical parameters; Review; tight junction; toxicology; ulcerative colitis; chemistry; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Organic Chemicals

In addition to this common ground, each specialty has its own particular aspects; the historical development of these are presented here with respect to otorhinolaryngology. Intravenous injections: The first experiments with intravenous injections were carried out in 1642 by a gentleman's hunting servant in eastern Germany. Similar experiments were done in 1656 by Christopher Wren, the astronomer, mathematician, and architect in Oxford, England, and a group of scientists around the physicist Robert Boyle. These experiments were prompted by new knowledge about blood circulation provided by William Harvey in 1628. The first books on the applications of intravenous infusions in humans were published in Germany by Major 1664 (Chirurgia Infusoria) and Elsholtz 1667 (Clysmatica Nova). Bladders of animals or enema syringes were used as instruments. Because of lethal accidents the infusions soon fell from favour. Kohler in Germany in 1776 eliminated a large bolus impacted in a patient's esophagus by an intravenous infusion of tartar emetic thus inducing violent vomiting. After this crucial experiment, foreign bodies in the esophagus were the most important indication for applying intravenous injections until Killian introduced extraction by esophagoscopy in 1990. Calibrated syringes after Pravaz: The French surgeon C. Pravaz in Lyon in 1853 invented a small syringe, the piston of which could be driven by a screw thus allowing exact dosage. A sharp needle with a pointed trocar could be introduced into the vessel making a dissection unnessessary. Pravazused his syringe for obliteration of arterial aneurysms by injection of ferric sesquichlorate. Pravaz's syringe initiated the invention of a great number of various calibrated syringes made of glass or metal combined with glass. Subcutaneous Injection and local anaesthesia: The calibrated syringes were commonly used in the treatment of syphilis by mercurialization. In otorhinolaryngology, they had and still have their primary application in local anaesthesia, which was introduced by Carl Ludwig Schleich in Berlin in 1892. Paraffin-injections: Around 1900 the injection of liquid paraffin for closing defects in subcutaneous tissues came into use (Gersuny in Vienna, Delangre in Tournai). This technique was immediately applied to rhinological indications such as a saddle nose (Stein 1901). This gave rise to the invention of special syringes and modifications of paraffin with different hardnesses and melting points. Around the middle of this century, paraffin was abandoned for this application because of serious complications, and new substances were introduced such like teflon, silicone and collagen. The historical development of these techniques of injections is described in details with many literature citations and figures.","paraffin; esophagoscopy; foreign body; Germany; history of medicine; infusion; injection; local anesthesia; otorhinolaryngology; priority journal; review; subcutaneous drug administration; syringe; vomiting; Anesthesia, Local; England; Germany; History, 17th Century; History, 18th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Injections; Injections, Intravenous; Injections, Subcutaneous; Medical Illustration; Museums; Otolaryngology; Paraffin; Syringes"

However, the reactivity, removal efficiency, transformation products (TPs), and mechanisms of such emerging pollutants by different treatment processes have not been well elucidated. Particularly, the transformation-driven environmental risks have been mostly overlooked. Therefore, we present a review to address these issues from chemical and toxicological viewpoints. Four degradation systems can be largely classified as catalytic persulfate (PS) oxidation, non-catalytic oxidation, photolysis and photocatalysis, and biodegradation. It was found that bisphenol alternatives possess distinct reactivities with different oxidizing species, with the highest performance for hydroxyl radicals. All systems exhibit superior elimination efficiency for these compounds. The inadequate mineralization suggests the formation of recalcitrant TPs, from which the overall reaction pathways are proposed. The combined experimental and in silico analysis indicates that many TPs have developmental toxicity, endocrine-disrupting effects, and genotoxicity. Notably, catalytic PS systems and non-catalytic oxidation result in the formation of coupling products as well as halogenated TPs with higher acute and chronic toxicity and lower biodegradability than the parent compounds. In contrast, photolysis and photocatalysis generate hydroxylated and bond-cleavage TPs with less toxicity. Overall, this review highlights the secondary environmental risks from the transformation of bisphenol alternatives by conventional and emerging treatment processes. Finally, future perspectives are recommended to address the knowledge gaps of these contaminants in aquatic ecosystems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic ecosystems; Biodegradability; Biodegradation; Catalytic oxidation; Chemical bonds; Efficiency; Endocrine disrupters; Hydroxylation; Photocatalysis; Photolysis; Alternative; Aqueous transformation; Bisphenols; Ecotoxicity; Environmental risks; Non-catalytic; Secondary environmental risk; Transformation mechanisms; Transformation products; Treatment process; Phenols; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; hydroxyl radical; ion; organic matter; water; aqueous solution; chemical compound; chemical pollutant; environmental risk; photolysis; toxicology; aquatic environment; biodegradability; biodegradation; chronic toxicity; computer model; developmental toxicity; ecotoxicity; hydroxylation; mineralization; nonhuman; oxidation; photocatalysis; photolysis; reaction analysis; Review; toxicology; water treatment; analysis; bioremediation; ecosystem; toxicity; water pollutant; Biodegradation, Environmental; Ecosystem; Photolysis; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The usage of iron to synthesize consumer products and to remediate environment is an attractive approach. This perspective presents applications of the high-valent iron oxo compound FeVIO42- (ferrate) in sustainable organic synthesis and treatment technology. In synthesizing organic molecules, C-H bond activation and selectivity are two basic ingredients of efficiency, which are attainable by ferrate. Examples of hydroxylation of hydrocarbons and conversion of alcohols to aldehyde/ketone are presented. In addition, many other organic molecules of amines, aniline, phenolic, and thiol functionalities can be oxidized by ferrate. This oxidation chemistry of ferrate is expedient in transforming pharmaceuticals, micropollutants in bodies of water with implications for human and ecological health. A wide range of micropollutants, which are commonly found in drinking water resources and wastewater effluents, can be efficiently oxidized by ferrate on a seconds to minutes time scale. These molecules include endocrine disruptors, antibiotics, β-blockers, antidepressants, X-ray contrast media, and cosmetic products. The reaction pathways of transformation of the studied pharmaceuticals are discussed. The results of the evaluation of toxicity of the oxidized products are given. The reduced product of ferrate is the environmentally friendly and magnetic iron(III) oxide. Ferrate, as a green molecule, has true potential in sustainable production of organics and treating emerging pollutants in water. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",Antibiotics; Catalyst selectivity; Chemical activation; Chemical bonds; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Consumer products; Contrast media; Iron; Iron compounds; Mechanisms; Molecules; Oxidation; Pollution; Potable water; Remediation; Sustainable development; Synthesis (chemical); Toxicity; Water pollution; Water resources; Water treatment; CH-bond activation; High-valent irons; Hydroxylation of hydrocarbons; Pollutants; Sustainable production; Treatment technologies; Wastewater effluents; X ray contrast media; Effluents

In this study, we conducted a continuous monitoring program over the period 2011–2014 with seasonal monitoring in 2013 for PFAAs emitted from two rapidly developing fluorochemical industry parks located in the Daling River Basin, Northern China. The trend of PFAA contamination was identified, dominated by perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), with the maximum concentrations of 3.78 μg/L, 3.70 μg/L, and 1.95 μg/L, respectively. Seasonal monitoring uncovered the occasional emission of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). Construction trends of new facilities and associated manufacturing capacity of the main products were also analyzed to assess correlations with PFAA emissions. An assessment of the data over the period 2011–2014 found a positive correlation with fluorocarbon alcohol (FCA) production and emission of PFAAs. Groundwater and tap water around the main source indicated that the dominant PFAAs had different diffusion behaviors. PFBS levels were higher in surface water, while PFBA was dominant in groundwater and tap water, with PFOA levels being higher in downstream groundwater. Considering the continuous expansion and development of fluorochemical industry in the Daling River Basin, this study will provide abundant information on the effectiveness of risk assessment and management. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Chains; Groundwater; Manufacture; Rivers; Surface waters; Watersheds; PFBA; PFBS; PFOA; Seasonal trends; Yearly trend; Risk assessment; alcohol; fluorocarbon; fluorocarbon alcohol; ground water; haloacid; perfluoroalkane sulfonic acid; perfluoroalkyl acid; perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid; perfluorobutane sulfonic acid; perfluorobutanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; river water; surface water; tap water; unclassified drug; water pollutant; emission; environmental monitoring; risk assessment; river pollution; seasonal variation; chemical industry; China; concentration (parameters); controlled study; diffusion; environmental monitoring; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; Review; seasonal variation; water contamination; water sampling; chemistry; environmental monitoring; procedures; time factor; water pollutant; China; Chemical Industry; China; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Time Factors; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The major clinical manifestation of PNH is chronic intravascular hemolysis of various severity. Patients-mostly young adults - may also present with episodes of abdominal or back pain. Common cause of death is thrombosis especially of the hepatic veins. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia may be the initial manifestation of PNH, indicating that the disorder is a primary bone-marrow disease, affecting not only the erythrocytes but also other peripheral blood cells and the haematopoietic stem cell. The course of the disease is variable. Partial complete recovery was described, but also fatal thrombosis. The major phenotypic expression of PNH is an increased susceptibility of the erythrocytes to the lytic action of complement in vitro. The enhanced complement susceptibility is most probably due to membrane defects: two membrane proteins regulating the complement cascade in PNH cells were missing, the decay-accelerating factor, DAF, inhibiting the activation of the lytic complement complex and the C8 binding protein, C8bp, which interferes with the lytic process. Aside from the lack of the complement regulators also other membrane defects have been described (e.g. of acetylcholinesterase or alkaline phosphatase). The proteins as well as DAF and C8bp are linked to the cell membrane via a phosphatidylinositol (PI) anchor, leading to the speculation that the disease results from a deficiency in the posttranslational PI anchoring mechanism. The diagnosis of PNH is based on the Hamtest, but will be extended to the quantitation of the above described membrane proteins. Therapy of PNH is restricted to treatment of symptoms: Transfusion of washed erythrocytesnecessary when the hemoglobin level is critically low, iron supplementation, or in cases of thrombosis anticoagulans. Ideal treatment of PNH would be a replacement of the abnormal stem cells by bone-marrow transplantation. Due to its limitations bone-marrow transplantation have been done only in a few cases. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.","androgen; complement; iron; prednisone; complement; hemoglobinemia; hemoglobinuria; human; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; priority journal; review; differential diagnosis; erythrocyte; immunology; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; physiology; Complement; Diagnosis, Differential; English Abstract; Erythrocytes; Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal; Human"

The characteristics of OM affects the removal efficiency and influences its reactivity with disinfectants to form DBPs. Research on DBPs is interesting because of their potential carcinogenic health risks. Although the link between DBP precursors such as natural organic matter (NOM) and DBP formation is well established, knowledge on the individual NOM fractions and other DBP precursors responsible for various DBPs is poor. Moreover, data on other precursors of DBPs has not been synthesized. The aim of this paper is therefore to review literature on the quantity and quality of NOM and other DBP precursors, evaluate the formation and treatability of the individual NOM fractions, and establish their influence on the DBPs formation. Possible removal processes for DBPs and their precursors, along with their economic feasibility were discussed. The key findings were: (1) certain fractions of NOM play a pivotal role in the formation of DBPs, (2) commonly used DBP control approaches include post-formation treatment, while targeting the removal of specific DBP precursors is hard to achieve, and (3) membrane technologies, enhanced coagulation, and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are effective in removing NOM, although AOP technologies are generally not economically feasible and still need further development and up-scaling. Future research should focus on: (1) toxicological studies to establish public health risks associated with specific emerging DBPs, (2) providing sufficient empirical data to determine whether to regulate currently unregulated DBPs, and (3) economic analyses to inform implementation of DBP precursor removal methods such as AOPs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The RSC reflects the proportion of the total daily intake of a chemical that can be derived from water when all other sources of exposure (e.g., food, air) are considered. This term is applied by the USEPA and state regulatory agencies when deriving ambient water quality criteria, maximum contaminant level goals, and drinking water health advisories for noncarcinogenic and threshold carcinogenic compounds. The value assigned to the RSC term affects the calculated criteria directly, with the allowable concentration in water decreasing with a decreasing RSC. A default RSC value of 20%—applied by regulatory entities in the USA for more than 40 years—assumes that 80% of an individual's exposure to a chemical's reference dose is from nonwater sources. Although the RSC is a chemical-specific parameter, there are few instances where a value other than the default of 20% has been approved and used. In 2000, USEPA outlined the process for developing chemical-specific RSC values, yet primary use of the default RSC value has continued since then. This article reviews USEPA's methodology for deriving chemical-specific RSC values and provides a case example using perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) to explore how the USEPA and state regulatory agencies are applying USEPA's guidance. The case study highlights inconsistent derivation of the RSC term, rooted in limitations in the current methodology. We suggest additional clarification of and more thoughtful use of the available data that may not meet USEPA's current adequacy requirements. We also recommend that the USEPA discuss recommendations for using biomonitoring data to set RSCs. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2022;00:1–8. © 2022 SETAC. © 2022 SETAC.",NA

To facilitate the ever-changing needs of diagnosis, the development of detection approaches and FRET signal analysis are highlighted in this review. Due to their exceptional brightness, excellent photostability, and low or absent toxicity, conjugated polymers are verified as superior materials for in-vivo imaging, and provide feasibility for future clinical molecular-imaging applications.

Specifically, metabolomics is the systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specifically conveys cell processes. Fetal growth aberrations, including fetal growth restriction and macrosomia, convey the highest risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity, as well as increasing the chance of developing chronic disease in later life. We searched the electronic database PubMed for preclinical as well as clinical controlled studies pertaining to metabolomics analyses of maternal parameters and their influence on fetal growth. It was observed clearly that metabolic profiling/metabolomics approaches in maternal urine samples provide information on early-life exposure and are potentially linked to child health outcomes, in addition to identifying new biomarkers of exposure. This review article is aimed to discuss intra- and inter-individual variations in maternal urine profiles during pregnancy, fetal growth outcomes and environmental sources of metabolic variations.

The relation of PFASs to fertility has now been examined in a relatively large number of epidemiologic studies and a synthesis is in order. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFASs and measures of human fertility, with particular emphasis on perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Systematic literature searches were initially conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE and subsequently in references and citations of included papers. Studies were included if they assessed exposure to PFASs in biological samples in relation to reproductive hormones, semen characteristics, or time to pregnancy (TTP). Study characteristics and results were abstracted to predefined forms, and the studies were assessed for the risk of bias and confounding. Sixteen studies investigated the association between PFAS exposure in men and semen parameters, reproductive hormone levels, or TTP. There was a lack of consistent results among the numerous investigated exposure-outcome combinations. However, subtle associations between higher PFOS and lower testosterone or abnormal semen morphology cannot be excluded. Eleven studies assessed the association between PFAS exposure in women and TTP or reproductive hormones levels. Four of eight studies found prolonged TTP with higher PFOS or PFOA, but only one study found an association when restricting to nulliparous women. In men, there is little evidence of an association between PFAS exposure and semen quality or levels of reproductive hormones. For PFOS and PFOA, the literature indicates an association with female fecundability in parous women, which is most likely not causal. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",alkyl group; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pollutant; environmental exposure; female; fertility; hormone determination; human; infertility; male; outcome assessment; Review; risk assessment; semen analysis; systematic review; time to pregnancy; drug effects; fertility; pollutant; reproduction; toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Environmental Pollutants; Fertility; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Reproduction

While the elevated levels of various inorganic constituents could be attributed to natural processes, such as geological weathering and aquifer characteristics, many times, anthropogenic activities also substantially pollute the groundwater. On the contrary, the occurrence of organic pollutants is primarily due to various anthropogenic activities. Extensive groundwater mining, the hydraulic connection between groundwater and other surface water bodies, and leaking underground buried infrastructure also contribute to groundwater pollution. Water resources are scarce commodities, and preserving groundwater quality is of critical concern. This paper documents instances of groundwater quality impact during the year 2019 due to both natural and anthropogenic activities throughout the world.

Immobilization is one of the critical points to improve the storage and operational stability of enzymes. Additionally, immobilized enzymes have a significant benefit over free enzymes in terms of reusability.

The exposure begins while in utero and continues in infancy, during the potentially most sensitive early stages of life. This review summarizes the current knowledge on pre- and neo-natal exposures based on more than 200 articles published from 2000 to date. All relevant biological matrices used in the cited studies were included, such as maternal blood, umbilical cord blood, breast milk, placenta, amniotic fluid, fetal organs, newborns’ dried blood spots, and infant serum. We show that such exposures are geographically global with significant discrepancies among countries and continents, and that while the levels of major legacy PFASs (PFOS and PFOA) have declined since 2000, those of others may have not. We also show that levels of PFOS and PFOA exceed those of some major environmental toxins, such as p,p′-DDE, BDE-47, PCB-153, PBB-153, and OH-PBDEs in maternal blood. Given that the behavior and potential effects have an origin in molecular structure, biomonitoring and research at the levels of isomers and enantiomers are critically important. Through critical analysis of these works, we summarize the major achievements, consensus, and the deficiencies of existing research.

The primary sources of EPs in the environment include anthropogenic release, atmospheric deposition, untreated or substandard treated wastewater, and extreme weather events. Intensive research has been done covering the environmental distribution, ecological disturbance, fate, and removal of EPs in the past decades. However, a systematic review on the distribution of EPs in the engineered and natural aquatic environment and the degradation of different EPs by using anaerobic sludge, aerobic bacteria, and isolated strains are limited. This review article aims to highlight the importance, application, and future perceptions of using different microbes to degrade EPs.

Polyfluoroarylation has inevitably lagged somewhat behind its fluoroalkylation counterparts, emanating from a lack of awareness and understanding of the synthetic significance. Together with the renaissance of photochemistry, the photocatalytic polyfluoroarylation using polyfluoroarenes as an inexpensive and easy-available radical precursor has emerged as a topical interest and vibrant area of chemical research.

The complete removal of Tl(I) from wastewater is of significant emergency due to its high toxicity and mobility, however, Tl(I) removal is always confronted with numerous technical difficulties because of the extremely low Tl(I) concentration in wastewater and the disturbances of many accompanying impurity ions. Adsorption is currently the most widely used method for Tl(I) removal on industrial scale and varied kinds of adsorbents such as Prussian blue analogues, biosorbents, and metal oxides have been developed. However, the adsorption process of Tl(I) is always affected by the co-existing cations, resulting in low Tl(I) removal efficiency. Recently, the development of a variety of novel adsorbents or ion sensors based on macrocyclic compounds for enrichment and accurate determination of trace Tl(I) in aqueous solutions exhibits great potential for application in Tl(I) removal from wastewater with high selectivity and process efficiency. This paper provides an overview of the adsorption methods for Tl(I) removal from wastewater with emphasis on complexation properties between varied types of adsorbents and Tl(I).

Currently, data on the associations between exposure to POPs and the risk of mortality in the U.S. population is limited. Our objective was to determine if higher exposure to POPs is associated with greater risk of all-cause, cancer, heart/cerebrovascular disease, or other-cause mortality. Methods: Analyses included participants aged 60 years and older from the 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). We included 483 participants for analyses of PBDEs, 1043 for PFASs, and 461 for PCBs, and 1428 for OC pesticides. Exposures to POPs were estimated using biomarkers measured in serum. Mortality status through December 31, 2011 was obtained from public-use, linked mortality files. We used Cox proportional hazard models to quantify the associations of interest. Where we observed an association, we explored effect modification by sex, body mass index, smoking status, and albuminuria. We also explored the combined effect of PBDEs and OC pesticides in the subsample of participants with measures of both analytes. Results: Serum measurements of PBDEs, PFASs, and PCBs were not clearly associated with increased all-cause or cause-specific mortality in older Americans. Beta-hexachlorocyclohexane was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality [HR per 1 SD increase =1.18, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.38]. Oxychlordane [HR = 1.15 95% CI 1.06, 1.25], p,p'-DDE [HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.23], trans-nonachlor [HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.18], and beta-hexachlorocyclohexane [HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.52] were associated with increased risk of other-cause mortality. Exploratory analyses suggested associations between OC pesticides and other-cause mortality were modified by sex. Exploratory analyses also suggested that the combination of high PBDE and high OC pesticide exposure had a stronger than expected adverse effect on all-cause mortality. Conclusion: Higher exposure to beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, an OC pesticide, is associated with increased all-cause mortality and higher exposure to four OC pesticides is associated with increased non-cancer, non-heart/cerebrovascular disease mortality in U.S. adults 60 years or older. These associations may be modified by sex or exposure to other POPs. © 2017 The Author(s).","2,2',4,4' tetrabromodiphenyl ether; 2,2',4,4',5,5' hexabromobiphenyl; 2,2',4,4',5,5' hexabromodiphenyl ether; 2,2',4,4',6 pentabromodiphenyl ether; beta hexachlorocyclohexane; organochlorine pesticide; oxychlordane; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; chlorinated hydrocarbon; diphenyl ether derivative; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; pesticide; flame retardant; health risk; mortality; organochlorine pesticide; PBDE; PCB; persistent organic pollutant; pollution exposure; public health; adult; albuminuria; all cause mortality; body mass; cancer mortality; cerebrovascular disease; environmental exposure; female; heart disease; human; male; mortality rate; persistent organic pollutant; priority journal; Review; smoking; United States; aged; blood; epidemiology; middle aged; mortality; nutrition; pollutant; proportional hazards model; very elderly; United States; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Body Mass Index; Caprylates; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Nutrition Surveys; Pesticides; Proportional Hazards Models; Smoking; United States"

Despite these early warnings, the problems of groundwater, and thus drinking water, contaminated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) including PFOS are only beginning to be addressed. It is clear that this PFAS contamination is poorly reversible and that the societal costs of clean-up will be high. This inability to reverse exposure in a reasonable timeframe is a major motivation for application of the precautionary principle in chemicals management. We conclude that exposure can be poorly reversible; 1) due to slow elimination kinetics in organisms, or 2) due to poorly reversible environmental contamination that leads to continuous exposure. In the second case, which is relevant for contaminated groundwater, the reversibility of exposure is not related to the magnitude of a chemical's bioaccumulation potential. We argue therefore that all PFASs entering groundwater, irrespective of their perfluoroalkyl chain length and bioaccumulation potential, will result in poorly reversible exposures and risks as well as further clean-up costs for society. To protect groundwater resources for future generations, society should consider a precautionary approach to chemicals management and prevent the use and release of highly persistent and mobile chemicals such as PFASs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Chemicals; Contamination; Fire extinguishers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Potable water; Bioaccumulation potential; Chemicals management; Environmental contamination; Microgram-per-liter level; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; PFASs; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Precautionary principle; Groundwater pollution; alkyl group; drinking water; fluoride; ground water; perfluoroalkane sulfonyl fluoride; perfluoroalkyl acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; surface water; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; ground water; bioaccumulation; chemical pollutant; drinking water; groundwater pollution; organic acid; persistent organic pollutant; precautionary principle; reaction kinetics; bioaccumulation; case study; concentration (parameters); cost benefit analysis; environmental exposure; environmental management; human; limit of detection; priority journal; Review; sediment; soil analysis; water analysis; water pollution; prevention and control; water pollutant; water pollution; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Groundwater; Humans; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution"

PFAS have drawn increasing attention due to their frequent occurrence in the aquatic environment and their toxicity to animals and humans. Developing effective and efficient detection and remediation methods for PFAS in aquatic systems is critical to mitigate ongoing exposure and promote water reuse. Adsorption-based removal is the most common method for PFAS remediation since it avoids hazardous byproducts; in situ sensing technology is a promising approach for PFAS monitoring due to its fast response, easy operation, and portability. This review summarizes current materials and devices that have been demonstrated for PFAS adsorption and sensing. Selectivity, the key factor underlying both sensor and sorbent performance, is discussed by exploring the interactions between PFAS and various probes. Examples of selective probes will be presented and classified by fluorinated groups, cationic groups, and cavitary groups, and their synergistic effects will also be analyzed.

Due to its chemical and physical properties, it is accumulated in food chains and not metabolized. PFOA has been found in detectable levels in biological samples of animals and humans all over the world. Reported mean serum levels of PFOA is about 4 ng/ml in general population, and its estimated half-life is 3.8 years in humans. Although the exposure ways to PFOA is not exactly described for humans, it is suggested that contaminated drinking water, food, breast milk, indoor air, dust and non-stick pans might be the possible sources. While limited in number, the results of human studies suggested that blood, breast milk, liver, kidneys, lungs, seminal plasma, thyroid gland and bones are the principal organs for PFOA distribution. Epidemiological studies showed that there is a positive correlation between PFOA exposure and various health problems including carcinogenesis, cardiovascular and thyroid diseases, chronic kidney failure, hepatotoxicity, high cholesterol and obesity. In addition, data obtained from general population studies emphasized that PFOA affects reproductive, developmental and immune systems. In the present review, besides possible exposure ways of humans to PFOA, its toxicokinetic properties, and effects on human health have been explained. © 2018 Society of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ankara (FABAD).

This review summarizes the brief historical use and chemistry of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, routes of human exposure, as well as the epidemiologic evidence for associations between exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and the development of obesity, diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. We identified 22 studies on obesity and 32 studies on diabetes, while only 1 study was found for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis by searching PubMed for human studies. Approximately two-third of studies reported positive associations between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances exposure and the prevalence of obesity and/or type 2 diabetes.

The experiments were performed at 1.55 μm telecommunication wavelength. The Brillouin frequency shift (BFS) and the Brillouin bandwidth were 2.83 GHz and 105 MHz, respectively. The Brillouin gain coefficient was calculated to be 3.09 × 10-11 m/W, which was comparable to that of fused silica fibers. The Brillouin threshold power of the 100 m POF was estimated to be as high as 24 W, which can be, for practical applications, reduced by using POFs with smaller cores. These properties were compared with those of silica-based graded-index multi-mode fibers. We also investigated the BFS dependences on strain and temperature. They showed negative dependences with coefficients of -121.8 MHz/% and -4.09 MHz/K, respectively, which are -0.2 and -3.5 times as large as those in silica fibers. These BFS dependences indicate that the Brillouin scattering in PFGI-POFs can be potentially applied to high-accuracy temperature sensing with reduced strain sensitivity. © 2011 by the authors.",Brillouin; Brillouin frequency shifts; Brillouin gain; Brillouin threshold; Core diameters; Fiber-optic sensing; Fundamental properties; Fused-silica fibers; Graded index; Graded-index polymer optical fibers; High-accuracy; Polymer optical fiber; Polymer optical fibers; Silica fibers; Strain sensitivity; Telecommunication wavelengths; Temperature sensing; Brillouin scattering; Fibers; Nonlinear optics; Optical fibers; Polymers; Scattering; Ultrasonics; Fused silica

Structural analysis of four of these seemingly unrelated proteins revealed the recurrent use of a conserved beta-sandwich fold that has not been observed in any eukaryotic or prokaryotic protein. Herein we propose to call this unique structural scaffolding the PIE (Poxvirus Immune Evasion) domain. PIE domain containing proteins are abundant in chordopoxvirinae, with our analysis identifying 20 likely PIE subfamilies among 33 representative genomes spanning 7 genera. For example, cowpox strain Brighton Red appears to encode 10 different PIEs: vCCI, A41, C8, M2, T4 (CPVX203), and the SECRET proteins CrmB, CrmD, SCP-1, SCP-2, and SCP-3. Characterized PIE proteins all appear to be nonessential for virus replication, and all contain signal peptides for targeting to the secretory pathway. The PIE subfamilies differ primarily in the number, size, and location of structural embellishments to the beta-sandwich core that confer unique functional specificities. Reported ligands include chemokines, GM-CSF, IL-2, MHC class I, and glycosaminoglycans. We expect that the list of ligands and receptors engaged by the PIE domain will grow as we come to better understand how this versatile structural architecture can be tailored to manipulate host responses to infection. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","binding protein; protein binding; viral protein; binding affinity; bioinformatics; calcium transport; cell migration; conservation genetics; immune evasion; immune response; immunogenicity; microbial diversity; nonhuman; poxvirus immune evasion; protein expression; protein structure; Review; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; structural proteomics; structure analysis; chemistry; genetics; immunology; physiology; Poxviridae; protein tertiary structure; Immune Evasion; Poxviridae; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Viral Proteins"

Fluorine present in a molecule largely determines its specific chemical and biological properties. This thematic issue covers the trends of organofluorine chemistry that have been actively developed in Russia the last 15 ± 20 years. The review describes nucleophilic substitution and heterocyclization reactions involving fluorinated arenes and quinones and skeletal cationoid rearrangements in the polyfluoroarene series. The transformations involving CF3-substituted carbocations and radical cations are considered. Heterocyclization and oxidative addition reactions of trifluoroacetamide derivatives and trans- formations of the organic moiety in polyfluorinated organoboranes and borates with retention of the carbon - boron bond are discussed. Particular attention is devoted to catalytic olefination using freons as an efficient synthetic route to fluorinated compounds. The application of unsymmetrical fluorine-containing N-heterocyclic carbene ligands as catalysts for olefin metathesis is demonstrated. A variety of classes of organofluorine compounds are considered, in particular, polyfluorinated arenes and 1,2-diaminobenzenes, 1-halo-2-trifluoroacetylacetylenes, α-fluoronitro compounds, fluorinated heterocycles, 2-hydrazinylidene-1,3-dicarbonyl derivatives, imines and silanes.

Due to greater restrictions on PFOS globally in recent years, the production and use of F-53B correspondingly increased, consequently causing more emissions into the environment. In China, an increasing number of studies report frequent detection and broad exposure to F-53B in the natural environment, various wildlife and the human body. In human blood, the detection rate of F-53B is almost 80%, accounting for 8.69 to 28% of ∑per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). F-53B is the most biopersistent PFAS in humans to date, with a half-life of 15.3 years. In addition, F-53B displays protein binding affinity and high human placental permeability. Recently, some epidemiological studies have reported the health risks associated with F-53B in humans, including abnormal serum lipid metabolism, vascular dysfunction, endocrine disorders and even adverse birth outcomes. Various in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated the toxicity of F-53B, such as hepatotoxicity, interference effects on the endocrine system, as well as reproductive and developmental toxicity. Our aims are to review studies on human F-53B exposure levels, trends and associated health effects; evaluate the potential toxicity; and predict directions for future research. © 2022 The Authors","Binding energy; Biochemistry; Electroplating; Health risks; China; Electroplating industry; F-53b; Human bloods; Human bodies; Human exposures; Natural environments; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Sulphonic acids; Toxicity; chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acid; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; sulfonic acid derivative; chlorinated hydrocarbon; endocrine system disorder; ether; metabolism; pollution exposure; potential field; toxicity; air pollutant; binding affinity; blood level; blood placenta barrier; China; ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; half life time; human; membrane permeability; protein binding; Review; toxicity testing; trend study; animal; chemistry; female; metabolism; placenta; pregnancy; water pollutant; zebra fish; China; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; China; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Placenta; Pregnancy; Sulfonic Acids; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish"

They are widely used in industrial and consumer applications. Due to their persistence, bioaccumulation, long-distance migration and toxicity, it is important to find new compounds that can replace PFASs. The present review investigated the sources, fates and environmental effects of alternative PFAS compounds using surveys have been conducted over the past several years. Concentrations of PFAS alternatives in various environmental media, as well as human tissues, are summarized based on the available data. The results showed that hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer (HFPO-DA), hexafluoropropylene trimer acids (HFPO-TA), and 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid (6:2 Cl-PFESA) have become the dominant global perfluorinated pollutants. Currently, there are a few toxicity assessments of these novel fluorinated alternatives, showing that they have systemic multiple organ toxicities. PFAS alternatives exhibited comparable or even more serious potential toxicity than legacy PFASs, indicating that these fluorinated alternatives are also harmful to the environment. Therefore, these alternatives require additional toxicological studies to confirm whether they can be used for a long time. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","ammonium 4,8 dioxa 3h perfluorononanoate; chlorinated polyfluorinatedether sulfonate; drinking water; fluorotelomer carboxylic acid; fluorotelomer sulfonic acid; ground water; hexafluoropropylene oxidedimer acid; hexafluoropropylene oxidetrimer acid; industrial chemical; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; concentration (composition); health risk; literature review; persistent organic pollutant; risk assessment; source apportionment; surfactant; toxicity; bioaccumulation; chemical structure; concentration (parameter); ecotoxicity; environmental factor; environmental impact; fluorination; geographic distribution; health hazard; health survey; human; municipal wastewater; Review; risk assessment; sewage; surface water hydrology; trend study; wildlife; adverse event; analysis; animal; environmental exposure; pollutant; toxicity; Animals; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Risk Assessment"

The tolerability and safety of triclosan has been evaluated in human volunteers with little indication of toxicity or sensitization. Although information in humans from chronic usage of personal care products is not available, triclosan has been extensively studied in laboratory animals. When evaluated in chronic oncogenicity studies in mice, rats, and hamsters, treatment-related tumors were found only in the liver of male and female mice. Application of the Human Relevance Framework suggested that these tumors arose by way of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) activation, a mode of action not considered to be relevant to humans. Consequently, a Benchmark Dose (BMDL10) of 47mg/kg/day was developed based on kidney toxicity in the hamster. Estimates of the amount of intake from in the use of representative personal care products for men, women, and children were derived in two ways: (1) using known or assumed triclosan levels in various consumer products and assumed usage patterns (product-based estimates); and (2) using upper bound measured urinary triclosan levels from human volunteers (biomonitoring-based estimates) using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the product-based estimates, the margin of safety (MOS) for the combined exposure estimates of intake from the use of all triclosan-containing products considered were approximately 1000, 730, and 630 for men, women, and children, respectively. The MOS calculated from the biomonitoring-based estimated intakes were 5200, 6700, and 11,750 for men, women, and children, respectively.

Infant markets already exist and, in 2002, they traded perhaps $10 million worth of emissions allowances. We estimate conservatively that, by 2010, the EU scheme will trade as much as $1 billion in allowances each year. The motor of the carbon markets is a worldwide effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Its most visible symbol is the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, formally known as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Even if Kyoto is not ratified and, despite the US's decision to opt out of the treaty, the genie of greenhouse-gas reduction is out of the bottle. We believe that trading of greenhouse gases will be a real, day-to-day activity by 2010, almost certainly in Europe and probably in Canada and Japan. Carbon trading in these areas will affect the US, whether or not America sets up a programme of its own. The conclusion of this study is that industry should get involved in defining carbon trading-and now-to advance and defend their interests. Interest should be greatest among producers and users of the greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide, namely methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the connections between pet animals, humans, and the environment, pet cats and dogs are often recommended as sentinels for the detection of environmental contaminants and for comorbidity tracking. However, their suitability as sentinels is yet to be established. Persistent organic pollutants and environmental hormones have replaced particulate matter (PM2.5) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in causing indoor air pollution. This review summarises the differences in the types and concentrations of indoor organic environmental pollutants detected in pet dogs and cats. This includes an analysis of the main exposure routes of different types of pollutants. To identify which of the two pet species are better sentinels, cats and dogs were compared based on their metabolic capacities of various indoor organic pollutants. In addition to PM2.5, a range of organic compounds including polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), bromophenols, perfluoroalkyl substances, organochlorine pesticides, fungicides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalic acid esters, organophosphate pesticides, organophosphorus flame retardants, and melamine have been detected in both dogs and cats. Pets often accumulate PBDEs from dust; however, traces of PBDEs are present in their diet. The indoor pollutant contamination levels in internal cats were generally higher than those in dogs. Cats accumulate organic pollutants associated with indoor environments, but they are sensitive to their toxicity because, unlike dogs, cats cannot metabolise most of the accumulated pollutants. Moreover, cats share similar clinical symptoms of thyroid diseases in humans. Based on the above observations of detection of indoor organic pollutants, it could be said that cats are better sentinels than dogs. Copyright © 2022 Ma, Wu, Ding, Wang and Luo.",NA

Currently, perfluorinatedsulfonicacid (PFSA) membrane has been widely employed in the membrane industry in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs); however, Nafion™ suffers reduced proton conductivity at a higher temperature, requiring noble metal catalyst (Pt, Ru, and Pt-Ru), and catalyst poisoning by CO. Non-fluorinated polymers are a promising substitute. Polysulfone (PSU) is an aromatic polymer with excellent characteristics that have attracted membrane scientists in recent years. The present review provides an up-to-date development of PSU based electrolyte membranes and its composites for PEMFCs, alkaline membrane fuel cells (AMFCs), and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) application. Various fillers encapsulated in the PEM/AEM moiety are appraised according to their preliminary characteristics and their plausible outcome on PEMFC/DMFC/AMFC. The key issues associated with enhancing the ionic conductivity and chemical stability have been elucidated as well. Furthermore, this review addresses the current tasks, and forthcoming directions are briefly summarized of PEM/AEMs for PEMFCs, DMFCs, AMFCs. © 2022 by the authors.

It can help provide insight into the ""black box"" and increase the understanding of the complex processes in CWs. In the last few decades, several process-based numerical models were developed to depict the pollutants removal processes in CWs, which include biochemical model, hydraulic model, reactive-transport model, plants model, clogging model, and coupling model combining two or more sub-models. However, there was a long way to go before fully understanding the decontamination mechanisms of CWs. On the one hand, single or a composite model coupling a small number of sub-models cannot fully reveal the decontamination processes. On the other hand, a comprehensive model including all sub-models of current cognition involves numerous parameters, most of which are interaction and cannot quantitatively determined, thus making the model complex and leading to diffuse interaction. Therefore, in order to describe the reaction processes in CWs more accurately, it is expected that all parameters should be quantified as far as possible in the future model. This study aims to provide a review of the numerical models of CWs and to reveal mechanism of decontamination. Based on the advantages and disadvantages of existing models, the study presented the improvement method and future research direction: (1) new detection/monitoring technique or computing method to quantitatively assess the parameters in CWs models, (2) correcting the simulation errors caused by the assumption of Activated Sludge Models (ASMs) and developing a complete biofilm reaction sub-model, (3) simplification of the comprehensive model, and (4) need of emerging pollutants modeling. © 2020 by the authors.",constructed wetland; degradation; future prospect; literature review; numerical model; parameter estimation; pollutant removal; subsurface flow

NA,The effects of postnatal exposure of endocrine disruptors on testicular function: a systematic review and a meta-analysis,2020,NA,NA,"Background Despite many epidemiological studies having been conducted, the impact of postnatal exposure of endocrine disruptors (EDs) on testicular function remains a controversial issue. Aim To systematically review the literature and perform a quantitative synthesis to evaluate the effect of EDs on testicular function. Materials and methods A comprehensive search was conducted in the MEDLINE, Scopus, and CENTRAL databases. Eligible for the systematic review were observational (cross-sectional and cohort) studies with (i) adult men who had a high probability of postnatal exposure to EDs (""exposed""), (ii) adult men who had a low probability of postnatal exposure to EDs (""non-exposed""), and (iii) an outcome of interest [seminal parameters and reproductive hormone concentrations]. The continuous outcomes in each of the studies were synthesized by the random effects model and expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Thirteen studies, including 959 exposed and 907 non-exposed men, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Exposure to EDs was associated with decreased LH [SMD - 0.17, 95% CI - 0.33 to - 0.02, 10 studies (616 exposed, 563 non-exposed), I-2 40%, p = 0.09], progressive motility [SMD - 0.45, 95% CI - 0.77 to - 0.13, three studies (133 cases, 153 controls), I-2 38%, p = 0.20], and normal morphology [SMD - 0.50, 95% CI - 0.85 to - 0.14, eight studies (562 cases, 540 controls), I-2 87%, p < 0.01] compared with non-exposure. No difference was observed between the other study groups. Conclusions Postnatal exposure to EDs is associated with decreased semen quality. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that a disruption of testicular function mediates the deterioration in semen quality.",NA

There is growing evidence that several of these chemical compounds interfere with human development in various ways. The aim of this review is to provide an update on the relationship between various persistent organic pollutants and childhood neurodevelopmental outcome from studies from the past 10 years. This review focuses on exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and in addition on exposure to phthalates, bisphenol A, and perfluorinated compounds and their associations with neurodevelopmental outcome in childhood, up to 18 years of age. This review shows that exposure to environmental chemicals affects neurodevelopmental outcome in children. Regarding exposure to PCBs and OH-PCBs, most studies report no or inverse associations with neurodevelopmental outcomes. Regarding exposure to PBDEs, lower mental development, psychomotor development and IQ were found at preschool age, and poorer attention at school age. Regarding exposure to DDE, most studies reported inverse associations with outcome, while others found no associations. Significant relations were particularly found at early infancy on psychomotor development, on attention and ADHD, whereas at school age, no adverse relationships were described. Additionally, several studies report gender-related vulnerability. Future research should focus on the long-term effects of prenatal and childhood exposure to these environmental chemicals, on sex-specific and combined exposure effects of environmental chemicals, and on possible mechanisms by which these chemicals have their effects on neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzhydryl derivative; diphenyl ether derivative; phenol derivative; phthalic acid derivative; pollutant; polychlorinated biphenyl; adolescent; animal; chemically induced; child; female; human; infant; mental disease; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; newborn; pollutant; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; preschool child; toxicity; Adolescent; Animals; Benzhydryl Compounds; Child; Child, Preschool; Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Phenols; Phthalic Acids; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"

Fosfomycin is known for its robust bactericidal effect against ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and CRE. However, fosfomycin-modified genes have been reported in transposon elements and conjugative plasmids, resulting in fosfomycin resistance in parts of East Asia. Here we review reports of fosfomycin-modified (fos) genes in Enterobacteriaceae and assess the efficacy of fosfomycin against multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections. At least 10 kinds of fos genes have been identified in the past decade; of these, fosA (and fosA subtypes) and fosC2 are primarily found in Enterobacteriaceae. All fosA subtypes except fosA2 are found in plasmids and transposons, nearby insertion sequence elements, or integrons, indicating that mobilizing elements also play an important role in plasmid-mediated fos genes in Enterobacteriaceae. fosA3, which is prevalent in East Asia, has been transmitted (mostly by animals) within and across continents via IS26 mobile elements. The acquisition of multiple antibiotic resistance genes via plasmids and mobile elements has resulted in a need for combined treatments for Enterobacteriaceae cases. The combination of fosfomycin and carbapenem has been the focus of many in vitro studies, but there is a clear need for additional in vivo investigations involving pharmacokinetics. © 2017","carbapenem; fosfomycin; glutathione transferase; protein disulfide reductase (glutathione); antiinfective agent; bacterial protein; beta lactamase; carbapenemase; fosfomycin; Achromobacter denitrificans; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic therapy; Bacillus subtilis; bacterial gene; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterobacteriaceae infection; fosA2 gene; fosA4 gene; fosA5 gene; fosA6 gene; fosB2 gene; fosB3 gene; fosC2 gene; fosD gene; fosE gene; fosG gene; fosK gene; gene insertion sequence; integron; multidrug resistant Enterobacteriaceae; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oncogene c fos; plasmid; Pseudomonas syringae; Review; Staphylococcus epidermidis; transposon; carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae; classification; drug effect; Enterobacteriaceae infection; genetics; human; microbiology; multidrug resistance; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins; beta-Lactamases; Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae; DNA Transposable Elements; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Enterobacteriaceae Infections; Fosfomycin; Humans; Plasmids"

We show how the optoelectronic properties may be tuned by varying the amount of bridging between one bridge per two phenylenes in polyfluorenes through to completely bridged ladder-type polyphenylenes, and by changing the nature of the substituents at the bridgeheads. Of particular importance is the suppression of undesirable long wavelength emission by controlling interchain interactions and choosing synthetic methods so as to hinder or prevent the formation of emissive defects. The electroluminescence efficiency of these materials can also be enhanced by the use of charge-transporting substituents.

Notably, human health risk assessment is required for risk mitigation. The lack of human health risk assessment and management may thus unreliably regulate the quality of water resources and efficiency of treatment processes. Therefore, drinking water supply systems (DWSSs) may be still unwarranted in assuring safe access to potable drinking water. Drinking water supply, such as tap water, is an additional and crucial route of human exposure to the health risks associated with EDCs. A holistic system, incorporating continuous research in DWSS monitoring and management using multi-barrier approach, is proposed as a preventive measure to reduce human exposure to the risks associated with EDCs through drinking water consumption. The occurrence of EDCs in DWSSs and corresponding human health risk implications are analyzed using the Needs, Approaches, Benefits, and Challenges (NABC) method. Therefore, this review may act as a supportive tool in protecting human health and environmental quality from EDCs, which is essential for decision-making regarding environmental monitoring and management purposes.

Although these compounds have probably been present in the environment for many decades, we are only now beginning to realize that these environmental contaminants may have serious environmental and health effects. This article gives a state-of-the-art review of synthetic approaches that have been employed for the synthesis of these environmentally relevant fluorinated compounds. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid derivatives, in particular, pose a problem because only a few perfluorooctanesulfonic acid derivatives are available from commercial sources-a fact that limits the ability of researchers worldwide to further study these compounds. Because of the limited literature available, this article also describes synthetic approaches for shorter chain homologues or perfluoroether analogues that can potentially be applied for the synthesis of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid derivatives. The preparation of typical starting materials for the synthesis of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid derivatives such as the perfluoroalkanesulfonyl fluorides and chlorides will be discussed. Subsequently, their conversion into relevant perfluoroalkane sulfonate salts (RFSO3M), sulfonamides (RFSO2NH 2), N-alkyl sulfonamides (RFSO2NHR, R = alkyl), N,N-dialkyl sulfonamides (RFSO2NR2, R = alkyl), sulfonamidoethanol (RFSO2NRCH2CH 2OH, R = -H, -CH3 or -C2H5) and sulfonamidoacetates (RFSO2NRCH2CO2H, R = -H, -CH3 or -C2H5) will be described.

While each formulation has its own physical characteristics, biological activities, and adverse reaction profile. In this article, we provided an overview focusing main on current status of haemoglobin-derived red blood cell substitutes from human, bovine and recombinant sources, as well as perfluorochemicals that dissolve O2 . Development, product specification, physiologic effects, efficacy and side effects of the following products are described: polymerized Hb (PolyHeme®, HBOC-201, Hemolink®), diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin (HemAssist®), human recombinant hemoglobin (rHb1.1 and rHb2.0), maleimide-activated polyethylene glycol-modified hemoglobin (MP4), Hb-vesicles, albumin-heme and perflubron emulsion (Oxygent®, Oxyfluor®, Perftoran®). In addition, we presented some possible interests in the future artificial oxygen carriers research.",diaspirin crosslinked hemoglobin; hemoglobin; oxygen; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctyl bromide; polymerized hemoglobin; recombinant hemoglobin; blood donor; erythrocyte transfusion; human; nonhuman; polymerization; review; solution and solubility; Bovinae
NA,Increased blood levels of persistent organic pollutants (POP) in obese individuals after weight loss—A review,2017,NA,NA,"Lipophilic persistent organic pollutants (POP) are stored in adipose tissue. Following rapid weight loss such as when induced by bariatric surgery, an increased release of potential harmful lipophilic compounds into the blood circulation may occur. Weight reduction is recommended for overweight and obese individuals in order to decrease risk of weight-related health problems. However, in cases of significant weight reduction POP become mobilized chemicals and consequently may adversely affect health, including endocrine disruption. The objective of the present investigation was to estimate quantitatively the level of mobilization of POP following weight loss over time. According to literature search criteria, 17 studies were identified with 2061 participants. Data from 5 of the studies with 270 participants were used to assess the change in blood levels of POP in percent per kilogram weight loss. Weight loss in the included studies varied from 4.4 to 64.8 kg. In all studies, the majority of POP concentrations in blood were found to rise following weight reduction. Blood concentrations following weight reduction were elevated by 2–4% per kilogram weight loss for most POP examined. The increased POP levels were still elevated 12 mo after intervention. Most research in this field, including animal studies, is carried out on a single compound or group of selected compounds, not taking the “cocktail effect” into consideration. This does not reflect the true range of POP to which humans are actually exposed. Few chronic investigations have been published and, in particular, few studies were available that compared the increase in POP concentrations with clinical consequences as individuals lost weight. These limitations call for caution in interpreting results. The benefits of losing weight still far outweigh the potential adverse health risks. However, further studies are recommended to determine the clinical significance of increased blood levels of POPs following rapid and excessive weight loss, particularly for women attending weight reduction treatment before pregnancy. © 2016, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © Aina Jansen, Jan L.

Decades of work on essential bacterial genes and the recent explosion in the number of available bacterial genomic sequences set the groundwork for the identification of essential genes from diverse bacteria. This knowledge has allowed for the substitution of essential genes from cold-loving bacteria into the chromosomes of pathogenic bacteria.

The EDX examination is probably the best procedure available by which to evaluate brachial plexus lesions. It provides localizing, pathologic, pathophysiologic, severity, and prognostic information. By localizing the lesion and identifying the underlying pathophysiology, it often predicts the underlying etiologic process; for example, (1) major T1 APR involvement with true neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome; (2) C8 APR involvement with postmedian sternotomy brachial plexopathies; (3) supraclavicular demyelinating conduction block with classic postoperative paralysis (often confined to the upper plexus); (4) widespread infraclavicular demyelinating conduction blocks with radiation plexopathy; (5) severe progressive axon loss with neoplastic processes; (6) motor NCS abnormalities exceeding sensory NCS abnormalities for the same peripheral nervous system segment with intraspinal canal lesions (eg, avulsions); (7) demyelinating conduction block with sparing of the pertinent sensory NCS study with multifocal motor neuropathy; and (8) lack of EDX abnormalities with hysteria, conversion reactions, and malingering, as well as with disputed neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. In addition, incorrect clinical considerations may be excluded (eg, when abnormal SNAPs are identified, an isolated radiculopathy is excluded). Among the various EDX study components, the sensory NCS are the most useful for brachial plexus element localization. One drawback of the sensory NCS for localization occurs in the setting of concomitant carpal tunnel syndrome; the latter negates the utility of the median sensory NCS for brachial plexus localization. The motor NCS and NEE often overcome this drawback and, regardless of sensory NCS findings, are always performed.","brachial plexus neuropathy; disease classification; electrodiagnosis; human; neuroanatomy; pathophysiology; priority journal; review; article; brachial plexus; differential diagnosis; electrodiagnosis; electromyography; methodology; motoneuron; physiology; sensitivity and specificity; sensory receptor; Brachial Plexus; Brachial Plexus Neuropathies; Diagnosis, Differential; Electrodiagnosis; Electromyography; Human; Motor Neurons; Receptors, Sensory; Sensitivity and Specificity; Brachial Plexus; Diagnosis, Differential; Humans; Motor Neurons; Receptors, Sensory; Sensitivity and Specificity"

Indoor air models, in turn, are incorporated into the structure of total human exposure models. Fragmentary data on residential ventilation rates are available in various governmental reports, journal articles, and contractor reports. Most of the published papers present data on only a few homes to answer very specialized questions, and none of these publications summarize the ventilation rates of a large population of homes across the United States. Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has conducted more than 4000 residential perfluorocarbon tracer (PFT) measurements and brought them together into a large data base from about 100 studies in the United States and elsewhere. This paper analyzes the BNL PFT data base to generate frequency distributions and summary statistics for different regions of the United States, different seasons, and different levels within the homes. The data analyses suggest that residential ventilation rates are similar in the northeastern and northwestern states but higher in the southwestern states. Winter and fall ventilation rates are similar, but the rates are slightly higher in spring, and much higher in summer. Multi-level residences have higher air exchange rates than single-level residences. Although the BNL data are not a representative sample of homes in the United States, these analyses give insight into the range of air exchange rates found in the United States under a great variety of conditions and are intended for use by developers of models of indoor air quality and total human exposure.","air conditioning; biological model; environmental exposure; human; indoor air pollution; review; season; standard; statistics; United States; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Models, Biological; Seasons; United States; Ventilation"

Adsorption not only is an effective technology to remove PFCs from water or wastewater, but also affects PFC distribution at solid-liquid interfaces and their fate in aquatic environments. This article reviews the adsorption behavior of different PFCs (mainly perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoate) on various adsorptive materials. Some effective adsorbents are introduced in detail in terms of their preparation, characteristics, effects of solution chemistry and PFC properties on adsorption. Adsorption mechanisms of PFCs on different adsorbents are summarized, and various interactions including electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interaction, ligand exchange, and hydrogen bond are fully reviewed. The adsorbents with amine groups generally have high adsorption capacity for PFCs, and formation of micelles/hemi-micelles plays an important role in achieving high adsorption capacity of perfluorinated surfactants on some porous adsorbents. Hydrophobic interaction is mainly responsible for PFC adsorption, but the difference between PFCs and traditional hydrocarbons has not clearly clarified. This review paper would be helpful for the preparation of effective adsorbents for PFC removal and understanding interfacial process of PFCs during their transport and fate in aquatic environments. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Coulomb interactions; Electrostatic separators; Hydrogen bonds; Hydrophobicity; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption mechanism; Perfluorinated compound (PFCs); Perfluorinated compounds; Perfluorinated surfactants; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; PFOA; PFOS; Adsorption; activated carbon; adsorbent; amine; biomaterial; hydrocarbon; ion; mineral; molecularly imprinted polymer; organic compound; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; resin; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; water pollutant; adsorption; adsorption kinetics; aquatic environment; chemical procedures; human; hydrogen bond; hydrophobicity; ion exchange; isotherm; ligand exchange; nonhuman; particle size; pH; review; static electricity; surface property; waste component removal; adsorption; chemistry; procedures; sewage; water pollutant; Adsorption; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Because of the associated practices, the flows of several environmental pollutants into the organic products threaten food safety and human health. The contaminants that occur at higher concentrations in organic produce include persistent organic pollutants (61.3–436.9 ng g−1 lamb meat, and 0.28 pg g−1-2.75 ng g−1 bovine meat), heavy metals (0.5–33.0 mg kg−1 lettuce), organochlorine pesticides (11–199 μg g−1 carrots), cyclodienes, hexachlorocyclohexanes, hexabromocyclododecane (2–3 times higher than in conventionally produced porcine meat), hexachlorobenzene (1.38–14.49 ng g−1 fat in milk), and non-brominated flame retardants (1.3–3.2 times higher than in conventional produce of greenhouse-grown tomato and cucumber). Moreover, some pollutants like per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances with a longer half-life (1.50–9.10 yrs) are reported to occur in several organic products. In fact, several legacy persistent organic pollutants are known for their significant trophic magnification in an urban terrestrial ecosystem. In addition, many plant functionalities are adversely affected in organic farming. Therefore, the long-term usage of organic products containing such pollutants poses a significant threat to human health. The major limitation in organic livestock production is the severe shortage of organic feed. Several variable standards and technical regulations set by the government and private agencies are the major obstacles in the global marketing of organic products. The present review critically addresses the impact of organic farming on hidden risks due to the use of composts as the amendment resources that enhance the phytoaccumulation and trophic transfer of pollutants, the functional diversity of the ecosystems, and poor harmonization among the policies and regulations in different countries for organic farming.

Osteoporosis affects approximately 200 million people worldwide, and nearly 9 million fractures occur annually. Evidence exists that, in addition to traditional risk factors, certain environmental substances may increase the risk of osteoporosis. Methods: The European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU) is a joint program coordinating and advancing human biomonitoring in Europe. HBM4EU investigates citizens’ exposure to several environmental substances and their plausible health effects aiming to contribute to policymaking. In HBM4EU, 18 priority substances or substance groups were selected. For each, a scoping document was prepared summarizing existing knowledge and health effects. This scoping review is based on these chemical-specific scoping documents and complementary literature review. Results: A possible link between osteoporosis and the body burden of heavy metals, such as cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), and industrial chemicals such as phthalates and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) was identified. Conclusions: Evidence shows that environmental substances may be related to osteoporosis as an adverse health effect. Nevertheless, more epidemiological research on the relationship between health effects and exposure to these chemicals is needed. Study results are incoherent, and pervasive epidemiological studies regarding the chemical exposure are lacking. © 2021 by the authors.

The prefoldin-group II chaperonin system is thought to be important for the folding of newly synthesized proteins and for their maintenance, or proteostasis, in the cytosol. Based on structural information of archaeal prefoldins, the mechanisms of substrate recognition and prefoldin-chaperonin cooperation have been investigated. In contrast, the role and mechanism of eukaryotic PFDs remain unknown. Recent studies have shown that prefoldin plays an important role in proteostasis and is involved in various diseases. In this paper, we review a series of studies on the molecular mechanisms of archaeal prefoldins and introduce recent findings about eukaryotic prefoldin. © 2018, International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB) and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",chaperone; chaperonin; prefoldin; unclassified drug; genome analysis; nonhuman; protein aggregation; protein function; protein homeostasis; protein localization; protein structure; Review

Despite restricted use due to current regulations on their use, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) remain the most commonly detected long-chain PFAS. This article reviews UV-based oxidative and reductive studies for the degradation of PFAS. Most of the UV-based processes studied at lab-scale include low pressure mercury lamps (emitting at 254 and 185 nm) with some studies using medium pressure mercury lamps (200–400 nm). A critical evaluation of the findings is made considering the degradation of PFAS, the impact of water quality conditions (pH, background ions, organics), types of oxidizing/reducing species, and source of irradiation with emphasis given to mechanisms of degradation and reaction by-products. Research gaps related to understanding of the factors influencing oxidative and reductive defluorination, impact of co-existing ions from the perspective of complexation with PFAS, and post-treatment toxicity are highlighted. The review also provides an overview of future perspectives regarding the challenges in relation to the current knowledge gaps, and future needs. © 2021 by the author.

In this review, relationship between PFASs and vegetables is summarized comprehensively. PFASs could transfer to cultivation soils by irrigation water, bio-amended soil, and atmospheric deposition mainly from industrial emissions. Carbon chain length of PFASs, species of vegetables and so on are key factors for PFASs migration and bioaccumulation in soils, plants and vegetables. Studies on food risk assessment of PFOA and PFOS show low consumption risk for most vegetables, however researches on other substances are lacking. In the future, we need to pay more attention on novel pollution pathway in cultivation, traceability research for considerable contamination, dietary exposure levels for different vegetables and more substances, as well as more exact and scientific food risk assessments.

These bound proteins can be imaged directly, or they may form 2-D crystalline arrays that are amenable to structure determination by single particle analysis or 2-D electron crystallography. 2-D crystals grown by this technique can also be used to initiate the growth of 3-D crystals for X-ray diffraction analysis. Many derivatized lipids have been prepared for use with this technique, incorporating a diverse range of ligands to enable binding to specific proteins. Synthetic lipids containing functionalized head groups that chelate Ni2+ or Cu2+ have also been prepared to bind and orient expressed proteins that contain His-tags. Protein-binding monolayer-forming lipids generally consist of two distinct components: (1) a branched hydrocarbon tail to confer fluidity to the monolayer and (2) a functionalized hydrophilic head group to facilitate binding of protein molecules at the air-water interface. Newer examples of these compounds also incorporate perfluorinated hydrocarbon moieties to confer detergent resistance to these lipids.

This review aims to evaluate the impact of environmental exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals [phthalates, parabens, triclosan, bisphenol A (BPA), organochlorine (PCBs) and perfluorinated (PFCs) compounds] on the reproductive potential among women, by reviewing most recently published literature. Epidemiological studies focusing on EDCs exposure and reproductive potential among women for the last 16 years were identified by a search of the PUBMED, MEDLINE, EBSCO and TOXNET literature databases. The results of the presented studies show that exposure to EDCs impacts the reproductive potential in women, measured by ovarian reserve and by assisted reproductive technology outcomes. Exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals decrease: (i) oestradiol levels (BPA); (ii) anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations (PCBs); (iii) antral follicle count (BPA, parabens, phthalates); (iv) oocyte quality (BPA, triclosan, phthalates, PCBs); (v) fertilization rate (PFCs, PCBs); (vi) implantation (BPA, phthalates, PCBs); (vii) embryo quality (triclosan, PCBs, BPA); (viii) rate of clinical pregnancy and live births (parabens, phthalates). The studies were mostly well-designed and used prospective cohorts with the exposure assessment based on the biomarker of exposure.

Mitochondrial unacylated holo-ACP is a component of mammalian mitoribosomes, and acylated ACP species participate as interaction partners in several ACP-LYRM (leucine-tyrosine-arginine motif)-protein heterodimers that act either as assembly factors or subunits of the electron transport chain and Fe-S cluster assembly complexes. Moreover, octanoyl-ACP provides the C8 backbone for endogenous lipoic acid synthesis.

The ecotoxicity and microbial resistance are considered to be major adverse environmental and health impact of pharmaceuticals even in trace amounts, which raise global concern. The recalcitrant nature of these pollutants restricts the application of the conventional treatment system for their remediation and triggers extensive research on the various advanced oxidation processes as a promising treatment system. Among them, visible-light-assisted semiconductor photocatalysis has significant potential as an efficient, low-cost, and green technology, which can use even solar energy as a clean and sustainable light source. A comprehensive review on the application of various visible light photocatalysts on the degradation of aqueous pharmaceutical pollutants was attempted to highlight their physiochemical properties, reaction mechanism, and catalytic activity in the laboratory- as well as field-scale operations.

Despite this there has been a continued and expanding use of polyclonal anti-T cell globulins in the management of cardiac, lung and renal transplants in many centres. As with all immunosuppressive drugs over and under-immunosuppression remains a major problem. A number of different methods have been described for monitoring anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) therapy in transplant patients. These include: monitoring serum IgG levels, the E- rosette assay; flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies. The measurement of serum IgG levels of the host animal (rabbit or horse) has been shown not to correlate with the presence of acute rejection episodes. The E-rosette assay has been found to be extremely time consuming and unreliable. With flow cytometric techniques, monoclonal antibodies directed against the T lymphocytes have been used to monitor ATG therapy and this has allowed the adjustment of the ATG administered to each individual patient. In patients receiving, renal, cardiac, lung or heart lung transplants we have developed flow cytometric assays to monitor ATG therapy on a daily basis with adjustment of the dosage of ATG administered according to this result. We have progressed from a dual platform assay where the T-cell percent from flow cytometry is combined with the lymphocyte count determined from a Haematology Cell Analyser to a single platform flow cytometric assay using commercially available polyfluorescent beads of two different types. An increasing problem with transplant patients is that ATG once given may induce antibodies against the heterologous rabbit or horse IgG. With time, a number of renal, cardiac and lung transplant patients have lost their grafts and are retransplanted. A similar situation is seen in patients who are given regular ATG therapy for the treatment of aplastic anemia. We have developed a flow cytometric duplex assay for the detection of such antibodies. This has allowed us to screen the sera of transplant patients for the presence of such antibodies before therapy is given and to suggest for that patient the most appropriate ATG to be used. The cellular and humoral assays we have developed are rapid and reproducible and are now used as routine in the clinical management of patients who are receiving or about to receive ATG therapy in transplantation. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

EPFRs can induce the formation of reactive oxygen species, which poses huge agro-environmental and human health risks. Their half-lives and persistence in both biochar residues and in the atmosphere may lead to potentially adverse risks in the environment. This review highlights the comprehensive research into these bioreactive radicals, as well as the bottlenecks of biochar production leading up to the formation and persistence of EPFRs.

A global joint initiative to create an all-encompassing regulations policy document that will improve both the technological and the quality control aspects of biochars to reduce EPFR generation at the production level. Furthermore, environmental impact and risk assessment studies should be conducted in the extensive applications of biochars in order to protect the environmental and human health. The highlighted key research directions proposed herein will shape the production, research, and adoption aspects of biochars, which will mitigate the considerable concerns raised on EPFRs. © 2019 The Authors",Agricultural robots; Crops; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Free radicals; Health risks; Reactive oxygen species; Risk assessment; Risks; Agricultural crops; Bio chars; Comprehensive research; Emerging pollutants; Environmental fate; Environmental remediation; Human health risks; Quality control aspects; Environmental protection; biochar; charcoal; free radical; unclassified drug; biochar; charcoal; free radical; biochar; bioremediation; environmental fate; environmental risk; reactive oxygen species; risk assessment; carbonization; cation exchange; chemical analysis; chemical bond; decomposition; depolymerization; ecosystem restoration; electron spin resonance; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental monitoring; germination; priority journal; pyrolysis; Review; risk assessment; soil acidity; chemistry; ecosystem restoration; human; Charcoal; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Free Radicals; Humans; Pyrolysis

This continued supply and use, despite strong evidence of negative impacts, is not unique to chemicals management. In the field of climate change, the concept of ""lock-in"" has been used to explain the complex interactions among economic, social, technological, and political dynamics that reinforce global reliance on the extraction and use of fossil fuels. Learning from carbon ""lock-in"" phenomena, this Perspective explores the challenges of chemicals management from the perspective of lock-in through three case studies: paraquat, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), and asbestos. These case studies illustrate that most current chemicals management frameworks fail to address the concerns arising from this complex interplay by not involving all relevant stakeholder groups that are part of lock-in, from producers to consumers. This results in a relatively narrow consideration (e.g., only demand but not supply) of the effectiveness and consequences of regulations. We submit that to break lock-in and address the global threat of chemical pollution, current approaches to managing hazardous chemicals should be broadened to take a comprehensive approach to understanding and managing factors contributing to lock-in, notably both supply and demand on national and international scales. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Several modeling studies have been conducted in attempt to resolve the dominant transport pathway of PFCs to the arctic-atmospheric transport of precursors versus direct transport via ocean currents. These studies are generally limited by their focus on perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) fluxes to arctic seawater and thus far have only used fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and sulfonamide alcohols as inputs for volatile precursors. There have been many monitoring studies from the North American and European Arctic, however, almost nothing is known about PFC levels from the Russian Arctic. In general, there are very few measurements of PFCs from the abiotic environment. Atmospheric measurements show the widespread occurrence of PFC precursors, FTOHs and perfluorinated sulfonamide alcohols. Further, PFCAs and PFSAs have been detected on atmospheric particles. The detection of PFCAs and PFSAs in snow deposition is consistent with the volatile precursor transport hypothesis. There are very limited measurements of PFCs in seawater. PFOA is generally detected in the greatest concentrations. Additional seawater measurements are needed to validate existing model predications. The bulk of the monitoring efforts in biological samples have focused on the perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs) and sulfonates (PFSAs), although there are very few measurements of PFC precursors. The marine food web has been well studied, particularly the top predators. In contrast, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems have been poorly studied. Studies show that in wildlife perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is generally measured in the highest concentration, followed by either perfluorononanoate (PFNA) or perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnA). However, some whale species show relatively high levels of perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA) and seabirds are typically characterized by high proportions of the C11-C15 PFCAs. PFOA is generally infrequently detected and is present in low concentrations in arctic biota. Food web studies show high bioaccumulation in the upper trophic-level animals, although the mechanism of PFC biomagnification is not understood. Spatial trend studies show some differences between populations, although there are inconsistencies between PFC trends. The majority of temporal trend studies are from the Northern American Arctic and Greenland. Studies show generally increasing levels of PFCs from the 1970s, although some studies from the Canadian Arctic show recent declines in PFOS levels. In contrast, ringed seals and polar bears from Greenland continue to show increasing PFOS concentrations. The inconsistent temporal trends between regions may be representative of differences in emissions from source regions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric measurement; Atmospheric particles; Atmospheric transport; Biological samples; Biomagnification; Canadian Arctic; Fluorotelomer alcohols; Food webs; Greenland; Low concentrations; Marine food web; Modeling studies; North American; Perfluorinated compounds; Perfluorinated sulfonamides; Perfluorooctane sulfonamide; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Perfluorooctanoate; Polar bears; Ringed seals; Source region; Spatial trends; Sulfonamide alcohols; Temporal trends; Terrestrial ecosystems; Top predator; Transport pathways; Volatile precursors; Animals; Biochemistry; Carboxylation; Concentration (process); Ecology; Monitoring; Ocean currents; Seawater; Sulfur compounds; Atmospheric movements; carboxylic acid derivative; lake water; organic compound; organofluorine derivative; perfluoro compound; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluoroundecanoate; sea water; sulfonic acid derivative; surface water; unclassified drug; arctic environment; concentration (composition); detection method; modeling; organic compound; seawater; sulfonate; temporal variation; Arctic; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric transport; bioaccumulation; chemical analysis; concentration (parameters); food web; freshwater environment; isomer; marine environment; ocean current; pollution monitoring; priority journal; review; sediment; trend study; Animals; Arctic Regions; Atmosphere; Birds; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Environmental Pollution; Fishes; Fluorocarbons; Fresh Water; Geologic Sediments; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Kinetics; Mammals; Octanoic Acids; Seawater; Snow; Arctic; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Greenland; Animalia; Cetacea; Phoca hispida; Ursus maritimus"

Worldwide detection of legacy and emerging PFAS as well as their toxicity and high persistence against most water treatment methods pose a serious environmental challenge. Photochemical processes offer feasible methods for PFAS decomposition due to their simplicity, operating in mild conditions, and high degree of efficacy. This paper identifies and compares mechanisms of photo-chemical/catalytic oxidation and reduction of different PFAS structures. The effects of adding different oxidative and reductive mediators - inorganic ions (e.g., persulfate and sulfite), organic solutes (e.g., aminopolycarboxylic acids), and photocatalysts - are comprehensively studied. Oxidative agents (e.g., SO4˙− and h+) and hydrated electrons (eaq−) are identified as the main active agents carrying out photo-oxidative and -reductive processes, respectively. PFAS are oxidatively degraded through one electron transfer to photo-induced oxidants followed by functional group detachment and chain shortening. On the other hand, cleavage of the C-F bond, functional group detachment followed by chain shortening, and center C-C or C-O bond scissions are proposed reductive pathways of PFAS decomposition upon reaction with eaq−. Moreover, the effects of key parameters on photodegradation of PFAS including operational parameters (i.e., pH, dissolved oxygen, and temperature), irradiation (i.e., wavelength and intensity), PFAS concentration and structure, and various water solutes (i.e., organic and inorganic matters) are evaluated in detail. In addition, the synergistic effects of combining other remediation processes, i.e., removal and degradation processes, with photochemical processes and benefits and challenges of such combinations are presented. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry",Image processing; Industrial chemicals; Industrial water treatment; Anthropogenic chemicals; Chain shortening; Commercial applications; Condition; Decomposition mechanism; Environmental challenges; Key factors; Photochemical process; Reductive decomposition; Water treatment methods; Dissolved oxygen; chemical compound; concentration (composition); decomposition; dissolved oxygen; photochemistry; photodegradation; photolysis; polymer; redox conditions; solute transport

Altered mammary gland development may impact a woman's lactation ability. Objective: This review identifies modern exogenous exposures which alter mammary gland development during embryonic life, puberty and pregnancy. Methods: A systematic review was undertaken whereby Medline, CINAHL and Embase articles published from January 1, 2005 to November 20, 2020 were searched using the keywords puberty or embry* or fetal or foetal or foetus or fetus or pregnan* or gestation* AND “mammary gland development” or “breast development” or “mammary development” or “mammary gland function” or “mammary function” or “insufficient glandular tissue” or “mammary hypoplasia” or “breast hypoplasia” or “mammary gland hypoplasia” or “tubular breast*” or “tuberous breast*” or “glandular tissue” or “breast composition” or “mammary composition” or “mammary gland composition”. After initial screening of 1207 records, 60 full texts were assessed for eligibility; 6 were excluded due to lack of information about exposure or outcome, leaving 54 studies. Results: The review included results from 52 animal (rats and mice, monkeys, rabbits, sheep, goats pigs and cows) and 2 human studies. Various endocrine disrupting chemicals and an obesogenic diet were found to be associated with altered mammary gland morphology during key development stages. Conclusions: To improve lactation outcomes, future studies need to focus on lactation as the endpoint and be conducted in a standardised manner to allow for a more significant contribution to the literature that allows for better comparison across studies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; endocrine disruptor; ethinylestradiol; perfluorooctanoic acid; endocrine disruptor; animal experiment; body weight; breast hypoplasia; breast tissue; case control study; case report; cell differentiation; clinical article; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; cow; cross-sectional study; embryo; gland tissue; goat; Haplorhini; histology; human; Leporidae; mammary gland; mammary gland function; mouse; nonhuman; obesogenic diet; observational study; pregnancy; puberty; Review; sheep; systematic review; animal; bovine; female; lactation; milk; pig; pregnancy; rat; sexual maturation; udder; Animals; Cattle; Endocrine Disruptors; Female; Lactation; Mammary Glands, Animal; Mice; Milk; Pregnancy; Rabbits; Rats; Sexual Maturation; Sheep; Swine"

The discovery of the existence of a prokaryotic cytoskeleton has changed this picture significantly. As a result, the idea has taken shape that the appearance of actin occurred in the very first cell; therefore, the emergence of microfilaments precedes that of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. The discovery of nuclear actin opened new perspective on the field, suggesting that the nuclear activities of actin reflect the functions of primordial actin-like proteins. In this paper, we review the recent literature to explore the evolutionary origin of nuclear actin. We conclude that both ancient and eukaryotic features of the actin world can be detected in the nucleus today, which supports the idea that the cytoskeleton attained significant eukaryotic innovations before the tandem evolution of the cytoskeleton and nucleus occurred. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",actin; actin related protein; heat shock protein 70; MreB protein; polymer; protein arp4; protein ftsa; protein parm; unclassified drug; actin; actin filament; cell nucleus; cytoskeleton; eukaryote; evolution; nonhuman; nucleocytoplasmic transport; priority journal; protein function; Review; structural homology; eukaryote; human; metabolism; Actins; Cell Nucleus; Eukaryota; Humans

PFASs have been detected globally in the aquatic environment including drinking water at trace concentrations and due, in part, to their persistence in human tissue some are being investigated for regulation. They are aliphatic compounds containing saturated carbon-fluorine bonds and are resistant to chemical, physical, and biological degradation. Functional groups, carbon chain length, and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity are some of the important structural properties of PFASs that affect their fate during drinking water treatment. Full-scale drinking water treatment plant occurrence data indicate that PFASs, if present in raw water, are not substantially removed by most drinking water treatment processes including coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, biofiltration, oxidation (chlorination, ozonation, AOPs), UV irradiation, and low pressure membranes. Early observations suggest that activated carbon adsorption, ion exchange, and high pressure membrane filtration may be effective in controlling these contaminants. However, branched isomers and the increasingly used shorter chain PFAS replacement products may be problematic as it pertains to the accurate assessment of PFAS behaviour through drinking water treatment processes since only limited information is available for these PFASs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Activated carbon; Aliphatic compounds; Chemical water treatment; Ion exchange; Irradiation; Isomers; Microfiltration; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Potable water; Surface waters; Water filtration; Activated carbon adsorption; Drinking water treatment process; High-pressure membranes; Membrane filtrations; PFASs; PFCs; PFOA/PFOS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Activated carbon treatment; activated carbon; aliphatic compound; carbon; drinking water; fluorine; fluorine derivative; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; surface water; unclassified drug; activated carbon; biodegradation; biofiltration; coagulation; concentration (composition); drinking water; environmental fate; filtration; flocculation; hydrophobicity; ion exchange; membrane; organofluorine; sedimentation; water treatment; adsorption; aquatic environment; biofiltration; chlorination; drinking; filtration; flocculation; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; hyperbarism; hypobarism; ion exchange; isomer; membrane filter; oxidation; ozonation; priority journal; review; sedimentation; ultraviolet irradiation; water treatment; Activated carbon; Drinking water treatment; Ion exchange; Membrane filtration; PFASs; PFCs; PFOA/PFOS; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Biodegradation, Environmental; Drinking Water; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Water Purification"

For decades researchers have been trying to develop approaches that mimic these two immediately vital functions of blood. Oxygen is crucial for the long-term survival of tissues and cells in vertebrates. Hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) and even at times anoxia (absence of oxygen) can occur during organ preservation, organ and cell transplantation, wound healing, in tumors and engineering of tissues. Different approaches have been developed to deliver oxygen to tissues and cells, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), normobaric hyperoxia therapy (NBOT), using biochemical reactions and electrolysis, employing liquids with high oxygen solubility, administering hemoglobin, myoglobin and red blood cells (RBCs), introducing oxygen-generating agents, using oxygen-carrying microparticles, persufflation, and peritoneal oxygenation. Metabolic waste accumulation is another issue in biological systems when blood flow is insufficient. Metabolic wastes change the microenvironment of cells and tissues, influence the metabolic activities of cells, and ultimately cause cell death.

Since dietary intake plays an important role in human exposure, the transfer of PFOS throughout the food chain needs further investigation. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of PFOS concentrations and transfer for the various chain steps from farm-to-fork. This reveals that most research focused on levels of PFOS in surface water and fish but data on soil and crops are largely missing. Furthermore, the uptake of PFOS by farm animals and subsequent transfer into meat and animal products needs further attention, as these products will eventually be consumed by the human population. Once the necessary data gaps are filled, the contribution of the various chain steps on the total PFOS intake can be established.

PFC was first used in organ preservation as a component of the two-layer method (TLM). The TLM is comprised of University of Wisconsin solution [UW] and oxygenated PFC for pancreas preservation. Pancreata preserved in the TLM are oxygenated through the PFC and substrates are supplied by the UW. TLM has been shown to prolong the preservation period and repair pancreatic injury caused by warm ischemia. Currently the TLM was used for pancreas preservation prior to clinical whole organ transplant. In this first clinical trial, the morphologic quality of the human pancreas graft after reperfusion was excellent compared with the pancreas stored in UW. In addition, there was no acute rejection episode of pancreata preserved by the TLM. TLM preservation of human pancreata, without initial cold UW storage, prior to islet isolation, resulted in better isolation results and improved the success rate of islet transplantation. Thus preservation of human pancreata by the TLM has become an important process for successful islet transplantation.

Rygiel K.,The hidden danger of environmental chemicals during the “windows of susceptibility” in a woman’s life – how can we use intermediate biomarkers to improve breast cancer prevention?,2021,10.2174/1875318302111010054,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109063408&doi=10.2174%2f1875318302111010054&partnerID=40&md5=31d67e304505ed03b1e2422341fdfbb0,"Introduction: It has been observed that many toxic environmental agents increase risk, accelerate development, or deteriorate the course of breast cancer (BC). In particular, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDC) are harmful to endocrine receptor actions and signaling in the breast tissue. Usually, there is a long interval of time between the exposure to EDC and BC incidence, and this often represents a serious obstacle for effective BC prophylaxis. Notably, during certain periods of a woman’s life cycle, the BC risk is particularly elevated due to increased susceptibility to some EDC. These windows of susceptibility (WOS) include prenatal, puberty, pregnancy, and menopausal transition stages of a female’s life course. Four WOS have been considered as the most vulnerable periods for BC since the mammary gland undergoes the main anatomical and physiological transformations at those intervals. This means that during specific WOS, the EDC from the environment can have the most dangerous impact on BC risk and possible BC development later in a woman’s life. However, most clinical BC studies related to toxic environmental exposures have not been connected to the specific WOS. Therefore, the goal of this article is to briefly describe some important research results, focused on the links between EDC and BC, within four critical WOS. In addition, this mini-review outlines some useful biomarkers for further research and prophylaxis of BC and also for both the research community and the medical professionals. Conclusion: To bridge the gap in BC prevention, it is essential to recognize the links between EDC and BC within the critical WOS. Moreover, an integrative model of BC research, applying intermediate biomarkers, is necessary to determine the mechanisms of action of various EDC during critical periods in a woman’s lifespan. Hopefully, this will lead to progress in BC prevention. © 2021 Katarzyna Rygiel.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; biological marker; cadmium; dimethylbenz[a]anthracene; endocrine disruptor; enterolactone; estradiol; low density lipoprotein; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; phytoestrogen; triclosan; adult; angiogenesis; bioaccumulation; body mass; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer prevention; cancer research; cancer risk; cell proliferation; climacterium; dietary intake; digital breast tomosynthesis; echography; endocrine system; energy expenditure; environmental exposure; environmental factor; ethnicity; female; food contamination; genetic resistance; hormone substitution; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; lactation; life cycle; lifespan; male; mammary gland; mammography; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; oocyte development; oocyte maturation; postnatal development; pregnancy; prenatal period; prevalence; prophylaxis; puberty; Review; risk factor; signal transduction; tumor invasion; tumor microenvironment"

Typologies of these owners have been developed to provide an understanding of the diversity of owners’ attitudes, values, beliefs, management objectives and behaviour. We analyzed PFO typologies from 28 European countries published from 1985 to 2015 in peer-reviewed journals and grey literature with respect to 1) research approaches and methods used; 2) typology objectives and problems addressed; 3) policy and management recommendations given. Using an on-line questionnaire we asked the first authors of the most relevant publications to retrospectively assess 4) the use of their typologies in education, science and forest policy. Most of the 66 publications reviewed share the common objective of providing a better understanding of forest ownership. Typologies were also developed to address roundwood mobilization, delivery of public goods, forest management approaches, involvement in PFO associations and entrepreneurship. The most common methodological approach was quantitative where owners were grouped by k-means clustering into 2 to 6 types and labelled with various names. Most frequently used labels were Multiobjective owners, Recreationists, Investors, Farmers, Indifferent owners, Conservationists, Multifunctional owners and Self-employed owners. Policy implications remain vague. The typologies had mostly been used in teaching and occasionally by politicians, civil servants or stakeholders. Only a half of the typologies had a follow-up study or was updated over time by the authors. After decades of classifying PFOs, it seems necessary to explore the link between typologies and forest owners’ overt behaviour. © 2017 The Authors",Classification (of information); Environmental protection; K-means clustering; Public policy; Family forests; Landowners; Literature reviews; Non-industrial; Policy instruments; Forestry; Delivery; Documents; Europe; Forest Management; Forestry; Labels; Methods; Psychology

Undecanol (C11) was found to be the most potent fungicide against this yeast with the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of 25 μg/ml (0.14 mM), followed by decanol (C10) with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 50 μg/ml (0.31 mM). The time-kill curve study showed that undecanol was fungicidal against S. cerevisiae at any growth stages. This fungicidal activity was not influenced by pH values. Dodecanol (C12) was the most effective fungistatic but did not show any fungicidal activity up to 1600 μg/mL. Fungistatic dodecanol quickly reduced cell viability, but the cell viability recovered shortly after and then finally became no longer different from the control indicating that the effect of dodecanol on S. cerevisiae was classified as a sublethal damage. However, fungistatic dodecanol combined with sublethal amount of anethole showed a fungicidal activity against this yeast. Anethole completely restricted the recovery of cell viability. Therefore expression of the synergistic effect was probably due to the blockade of the recovering process from dodecanol induced-stress. The alkanols tested inhibited glucose-induced acidification by inhibiting the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Octanol (C8) increased plasma membrane fluidity in the spheroplast cells of S. cerevisiae. The same series of aliphatic primary alkanols was also tested against a food spoilage fungus Zygosaccharomyces bailii and compared with their effects against S. cerevisiae. Decanol was found to be the most potent fungicide against Z. bailii with an MFC of 50 μg/ml (0.31 mM), whereas undecanol was found to be the most potent fungistatic with an MIC of 25 μg/ml (0.14 mM). The time-kill curve study showed that decanol was fungicidal against Z. bailii at any growth stage. This antifungal activity was slightly enhanced in combination with anethole. The primary antifungal action of medium-chain (C9-C 12) alkanols comes from their ability as nonionic surfactants to disrupt the native membrane-associated function of the integral proteins. Hence, the antifungal activity of alkanols is mediated by biophysical process, and the maximum activity can be obtained when balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic portions becomes the most appropriate. © Springer Science+Business Media 2013.",alkanol; anethole; decanol; glucose; lauryl alcohol; octanol; proton transporting adenosine triphosphatase; undecanol; acidification; cell membrane fluidity; cell viability; drug concentration; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug potency; drug potentiation; fungicidal activity; fungus growth; growth inhibition; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; minimum fungicidal concentration; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; priority journal; review; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; spheroplast; yeast; Zygosaccharomyces bailii

The adverse consequences of such psychiatric disorders for relatives have been studied since the early 1950s, when psychiatric institutions began discharging patients into the community. According to Treudley (1946) « burden on the family » refers to the consequences for those in close contact with a severely disturbed psychiatric patient. Grad and Sainsbury (1963) and Hoenig and Hamilton (1966) developed the first burden scales for caregivers of severely mentally ill patients, and a number of authors further developed instruments trying to distinguish between « objective » and « subjective » burden. Objective burden concerns the patient's symptoms, behaviour and socio-demographic characteristics, but also the changes in household routine, family or social relations, work, leisure time, physical health... Subjective burden is the mental health and subjective distress among family members. While the first authors refered to those problems which are deemed to be related to, or caused by the patient, Platt et al. (1983) tried to distinguish between the occurrence of a problem, its alleged aetiology, and the perceived distress, when developing the SBAS questionnaire. These authors also proposed separate evaluations of behavioral disturbance and social performance by relatives, and a report of extra-disease stressors in family life. The SBAS is actually the most complete, but also complex instrument for evaluating burden in caregivers. Since 1967 Pasamanick and others proposed questionnaires for burden evaluation in relatives of schizophrenic patients. Relatives may be included in specific psychoeducational programs, but few of these programs have been evaluated in terms of caregiver burden. The theoretical approach in schizophrenia was not different from that one adopted in mentally ill population. Some instruments were validated first in a mentally ill group and then adapted for schizophrenic population. This paper describes the available data about intruments measuring caregiver burden in relatives of schizophrenic patients. Mesures are summarized according to purpose, content and psychometric properties. Sixteen instruments have been collected from the litterature (1955-2001), and 2 instruments developed for relatives of mentally ill have also been taken into account. A group of 5 instruments focuses on the measurement of behavioural disturbance in persons with schizophrenia as perceived by their family members. Eleven scales include behavioural disturbance in a more complete decription of objective burden. Thirteen questionnaires also report the subjective distress in caregivers. One instrument has been developed in french language. Few of these instuments have been developed from a verbatim and really describe the caregiver's point of view. Most of them rely on experts point of view or on previously published studies. The content and domains explored by these instruments are variable. The psychometric properties are poorly documented for a number of them and no information is published about responsiveness. Some validated instruments are the Perceived Family Burden Scale (PFBS) the Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire (IEQ) and the Experience of Caregiving Inventory (ECI). In past studies, researchers more or less agreed about the dimensions that comprise the family burden. There was less agreement with regard to the definition of objective and subjective burden, and quite no agreement about the theoretical approach to the concept of burden. The evaluation of behavioural disturbance should now be excluded from the objective burden dimension. It is a specific domain, both objective and subjective, which can be described as a stressor in the stress-appraisal-coping model. A good approach of this domain can be found in the PFBS. It comprises 24 items and the principal components analysis produces 2 factors (« active » and « passive »), explaining 35 % of the variance, with good consitency and acceptable test-retest reliability. The evaluation is both objective (presence or absence) and subjective (induced distress). The Behavior Disturbance Scale (BDS) may also be taken into account, although it is less validated. This scale derives from the SBAS, modified as a self-questionnaire, with both objective and subjective evaluations of all items. The concept of burden was recently modified in a new theoretical approach by Schene, when developing the IEQ. According to this author, the burden scale is supposed to exclude stressors (patient's behaviors), as well as outcome variables (distress or psychological impairment in caregiver). The « caregiving consequences » section comprises 36 items, which focus on the subjective aspects of the caregiver's experience. Principal component factor analysis generates 4 factors which explain 45 % of the variance: tension, supervision, worrying, urging. The overall caregiving score substantially explains the connection between patient, caregiver, relationship variables and the caregiver's distress. This scale is a valid and simple instrument for caregiving eveluation. The ECI also introduces a new approach of caregiving and rejects the notion of burden. The 66 item version is composed of 10 factors (8 « negative » and 2 « positive ») with good internal consistency. The introduction of two positive factors (rewarding personal experiences, good aspects of the relationship with the patient) might be the basis of a usefull outcome measure for intervention aimed at promoting caregiver well-being. Nevertheless, the authors fail to develop an overall score that includes these factors, and focus on the negative dimensions as predictors of morbidity and well-being. None of the variables included in the regression model explain a significant percent of the variance of the ECI positive score. None of these instruments was employed for evaluating programs or treatments, even psychoeducational programs for caregivers. This may be partly due to the lack of data about sensitivity to change. No instrument is now available for evaluating therapeutics from the caregiver's point of view.","behavior disorder; caregiver; distress syndrome; family life; human; interview; leisure; prevalence; principal component analysis; psychometry; quality of life; questionnaire; review; schizophrenia; social behavior; symptom; Caregivers; Cost of Illness; Family Health; Humans; Questionnaires; Schizophrenia; Stress, Psychological"
NA,Is toxicant-induced Sertoli cell injury in vitro a useful model to study molecular mechanisms in spermatogenesis?,2016,NA,NA,"Sertoli cells isolated from rodents or humans and cultured in vitro are known to establish a functional tight junction (TJ)-permeability barrier that mimics the blood–testis barrier (BTB) in vivo. This model has been widely used by investigators to study the biology of the TJ and the BTB. Studies have shown that environmental toxicants (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), bisphenol A (BPA) and cadmium) that exert their disruptive effects to induce Sertoli cell injury using this in vitro model are reproducible in studies in vivo. Thus, this in vitro system provides a convenient approach to probe the molecular mechanism(s) underlying toxicant-induced testis injury but also to provide new insights in understanding spermatogenesis, such as the biology of cell adhesion, BTB restructuring that supports preleptotene spermatocyte transport, and others. Herein, we provide a brief and critical review based on studies using this in vitro model of Sertoli cell cultures using primary cells isolated from rodent testes vs. humans to monitor environmental toxicant-mediated Sertoli cell injury. In short, recent findings have shown that environmental toxicants exert their effects on Sertoli cells to induce testis injury through their action on Sertoli cell actin- and/or microtubule-based cytoskeleton. These effects are mediated via their disruptive effects on actin- and/or microtubule-binding proteins. Sertoli cells also utilize differential spatiotemporal expression of these actin binding proteins to confer plasticity to the BTB to regulate germ cell transport across the BTB. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",NA

This paper summarizes results from that program from 1998 to 2003 with respect to terrestrial animals in the Canadian Arctic. The arctic terrestrial environment has few significant contaminant issues, particularly when compared with freshwater and marine environments. Both current and historical industrial activities in the north may have a continuing effect on biota in the immediate area, but effects tend to be localized. An investigation of arctic ground squirrels at a site in the Northwest Territories that had historically received applications of DDT concluded that DDT in arctic ground squirrels livers was the result of contamination and that this is an indication of the continuing effect of a local point source of DDT. Arsenic concentrations were higher in berries collected from areas around gold mines in the Northwest Territories than from control sites, suggesting that gold mining may significantly affect arsenic levels in berries in the Yellowknives Dene traditional territory. Although moose and caribou from the Canadian Arctic generally carry relatively low contaminant burdens, Yukon moose had high renal selenium concentrations, and moose and some woodland caribou from the same area had high renal cadmium levels, which may put some animals at risk of toxicological effects. Low hepatic copper levels in some caribou herds may indicate a shortage of copper for metabolic demands, particularly for females. Similarities in patterns of temporal fluctuations in renal element concentrations for moose and caribou suggest that environmental factors may be a major cause of fluctuations in renal concentrations of some elements. Concentrations of persistent organochlorines and metals in beaver and muskrat from the Northwest Territories, and carnivores from across the Canadian Arctic were very low and considered normal for terrestrial wildlife. Two new classes of persistent fluorinated contaminants, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) were found in arctic carnivores and were most abundant in arctic fox and least abundant in mink. Although trace element concentrations in king and common eider ducks were low and not of toxicological concern, the number of nematode parasites in common eiders was positively correlated with total and organic mercury concentrations. Future research should focus on cadmium in moose and caribou, mercury in caribou, and emerging contaminants, with an effort to sample moose and caribou annually where possible to explore the role of naturally occurring cycles in apparent temporal trends. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, the application of UV/sulfite as an ARP and AOP (or oxidation-reduction coupling process) during water and wastewater treatments is reviewed respectively. (1) In the absence of O2, UV/sulfite works as an ARP. The generation mechanism of reactive reduction species and various contaminants removal (including degradation kinetics and efficiency, decomposition mechanisms, effects of some factors, etc.) is summarized in detail and systematically. Moreover, both the application of different types of UV lights and the economic evaluation are summarized systematically. (2) In the presence of O2, UV/sulfite could be used as an AOP or oxidation-reduction coupling process. The generation mechanism of reactive oxidation species and influencing factors is also presented in detail. Moreover, two ways (including homogeneous and heterogeneous activation) used to enhance the UV/sulfite oxidation potential are summarized respectively.

To date, three PPAR subtypes have been discovered and characterized (PPARα, β/δ, γ). Different PPAR subtypes have been shown to play crucial roles in important diseases and conditions such as obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, cancer, and fertility. Among the most studied roles of PPARs is their involvement in inflammatory processes. Numerous studies have revealed that agonists of PPARα and PPARγ exert anti-inflammatory effects both in vitro and in vivo. Using the carrageenan-induced paw edema model of inflammation, a recent study in our laboratories showed that these agonists hinder the initiation phase, but not the late phase of the inflammatory process. Furthermore, in the same experimental model, we recently also observed that activation of PPARδ exerted an anti-inflammatory effect. Despite the fact that exclusive dependence of these effects on PPARs has been questioned, the bulk of evidence suggests that all three PPAR subtypes, PPARα, δ, γ, play a significant role in controlling inflammatory responses. Whether these subtypes act via a common mechanism or are independent of each other remains to be elucidated. However, due to the intensity of research efforts in this area, it is anticipated that these efforts will result in the development of PPAR ligands as therapeutic agents for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.","15 deoxy delta12,14 prostaglandin J2; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; 3 chloro 4 [3 (7 propyl 3 trifluoromethylbenzisoxazol 6 yloxy)propylthio]phenylacetic acid; 4 [4 [3 (4 acetyl 3 hydroxy 2 propylphenoxy)propoxy]phenoxy]acetic acid; carrageenan; DNA; gw 7647; leukotriene B4; n (2 cyclohexyloxy 4 nitrophenyl)methanesulfonamide; nitric oxide; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; pirinixic acid; rosiglitazone; troglitazone; unclassified drug; aging; antiinflammatory activity; atherosclerosis; autoimmune disease; cancer; cell cycle; cytokine production; degenerative disease; diabetes mellitus; DNA binding; DNA binding motif; drug DNA binding; drug mechanism; drug specificity; fertility; human; inflammation; ligand binding; nonhuman; obesity; pathophysiology; paw edema; protein family; review"

Although overall mortality appears to be decreasing in recent years due to improvements in supportive care, there are presently no proven, effective pharmacological therapies to treat ARDS and prevent its associated complications. The most common cause of death in ARDS is not hypoxemia or pulmonary failure, but rather multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), suggesting that improving survival in patients with ARDS may be linked to decreasing the incidence or severity of MODS. The key to developing novel treatments depends, in part, on identifying and understanding the mechanisms by which ARDS leads to MODS, although the heterogeneity and complexity of this disorder certainly poses a challenge to investigators. Novel therapies in development for treatment of ALI/ARDS include exogenous surfactant, therapies aimed at modulating neutrophil activity, such as prostaglandin and complement inhibitors, and treatments targeting earlier resolution of ARDS, such as β-agonists and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. From a clinical perspective, identifying subpopulations of patients most likely to benefit from a particular therapy and recognising the appropriate stage of illness in which to initiate treatment could potentially lead to better outcomes in the short term. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.","acetylcysteine; adenosine triphosphatase (potassium sodium); beractant; beta adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; calfactant; complement inhibitor; dx 890; epi hne 4; fluorovent; gamma linolenic acid; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; icosapentaenoic acid; inasurf; ketoconazole; leukocyte elastase inhibitor; lipoprostaglandin E1; lisofylline; lucinactant; lusupultide; methylprednisolone; nitric oxide; perfluorooctyl bromide; placebo; prostaglandin; prostaglandin E1; recombinant granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; reltran; salbutamol; salbutamol sulfate; sivelestat; tp 10; tp 20; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; vitamin; antiinflammatory agent; antioxidant; fluorocarbon; lung surfactant; new drug; nitric oxide; perfluorooctyl bromide; respiratory tract agent; vasodilator agent; acute lung injury; adult respiratory distress syndrome; artificial ventilation; cause of death; clinical trial; critically ill patient; disease severity; drug dose increase; drug dose reduction; drug effect; drug efficacy; fluid therapy; heart supraventricular arrhythmia; human; mortality; multiple organ failure; neutrophil; nonhuman; outcome assessment; review; survival rate; adult respiratory distress syndrome; animal; chemistry; drug design; inhalational drug administration; multiple organ failure; pathology; patient selection; treatment outcome; Administration, Inhalation; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antioxidants; Drug Design; Drugs, Investigational; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Multiple Organ Failure; Neutrophils; Nitric Oxide; Patient Selection; Pulmonary Surfactants; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Respiratory System Agents; Treatment Outcome; Vasodilator Agents"

Hence, textile treatments for water or oil repellency should be non-toxic, biocompatible, and comply with stringent health standards. Moreover, considering the volume of the worldwide textile industry, these treatments should be scalable, sustainable, and eco-friendly. Due to this awareness, more and more non-wettable textile treatments with eco-friendly processes and green or non-toxic chemicals are being adopted and reported. Although fluorinated alkylsilanes or fluorinated polymers with C8 chemistry (with ≥ 8 fluorinated carbon atoms) are the best performing materials to render textiles water or oil repellent, they pose substantial health and environmental problems and are being banned. For this reason, water/solvent-borne, C8-free vehicles for non-wettable treatment formulations are probably the only ones that can have commercialization prospects. Hence, researchers have come up with a variety of new, non-toxic, green formulations and materials to render fabrics liquid repellent that constitute the focus of this review paper. As such, this review article discusses and summarizes recent developments and techniques on various sustainable superhydrophobic treatments for textiles, with comparable performance and durability to formulations based on fluorinated C8 compounds. The current state-of-the-art technologies, potential commercialization prospects, and relevant limitations are discussed and summarized with examples.

Environmental exposures can have lifelong consequences. In particular, exposures during the vulnerable fetal or early development period can affect structure, physiology and metabolism, causing potential adverse, often permanent, health effects at any point in life. External exposures, such as the “chemical exposome” (exposures to environmental chemicals), affect the host’s metabolism and immune system, which, in turn, mediate the risk of various diseases. Linking such exposures to adverse outcomes, via intermediate phenotypes such as the metabolome, is one of the central themes of exposome research. Much progress has been made in this line of research, including addressing some key challenges such as analytical coverage of the exposome and metabolome, as well as the integration of heterogeneous, multi-omics data. There is strong evidence that chemical exposures have a marked impact on the metabolome, associating with specific disease risks. Herein, we review recent progress in the field of exposome research as related to human health as well as selected metabolic and autoimmune diseases, with specific emphasis on the impacts of chemical exposures on the host metabolome. © 2020 by the authors.

Most of these SCs are potent cannabinoid receptor agonists that were initially developed to carry out scientific research but were lately hijacked by the illegal clandestine drug operators. SCs psychoactive effects, along with their dubious legitimate status, have made them notoriously attractive for clandestine recreational purposes. Many SC-containing products are labelled “Not for Human Consumption” in an effort to bypass regulation that prohibits the selling and manufacturing of such substances for human usage. SCs solutions are splashed onto herbal stuff and marketed as “herbal incense” worldwide. JWH-073, JWH-018, and CP 47,497, along with their C6, C7, and C8 analogs were the very first SCs detected by following the exploratory forensic analysis of seized botanical materials and street drugs. The number of these psychoactive compounds have grown over time, and appeared in the market as street drugs. These include numerous diverse classes of compounds having psychotropic properties which were characterized and identified. Governments all over the world are taking measures to prohibit and regulate these drugs of abuse. As many of these compounds are not included in the present drug laws they are posing serious legal problems for their effective control. As the forensic laboratories are receiving seized samples of this category for analysis, the knowledge and methodology of their analysis has become the urgent need of the hour.

In these types of systems, the anodic oxidation reaction is catalyzed by anaerobic microorganisms, while the cathodic reduction reaction can be carried out biotically or abiotically. Membranes as separators in MFCs are the primary requirements for optimal electrochemical and microbiological performance. MFC configuration and operation are similar to those of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs)—both having at least one anode and one cathode split by a membrane or separator. The Nafion® 117 (NF-117) membrane, made from perfluorosulfonic acid, is a membrane used as a separator in PEMFCs. By analogy of the operation between electrochemical systems and MFCs, NF-117 membranes have been widely used as separators in MFCs. The main disadvantage of this type of membrane is its high cost; membranes in MFCs can represent up to 60% of the MFC’s total cost. This is one of the challenges in scaling up MFCs: finding alternative membranes or separators with low cost and good electrochemical characteristics. The aim of this work is to critically review state-of-the-art membranes and separators used in MFCs. The scope of this review includes: (i) membrane functions in MFCs, (ii) most-used membranes, (iii) membrane cost and efficiency, and (iv) membrane-less MFCs. Currently, there are at least 20 different membranes or separators proposed and evaluated for MFCs, from basic salt bridges to advanced synthetic polymer-based membranes, including ceramic and unconventional separator materials. Studies focusing on either low cost or the use of natural polymers for proton-exchange membranes (PEM) are still scarce. Alternatively, in some works, MFCs have been operated without membranes; however, significant decrements in Coulombic efficiency were found. As the type of membrane affects the performance and total cost of MFCs, it is recommended that research efforts are increased in order to develop new, more economic membranes that exhibit favorable properties and allow for satisfactory cell performance at the same time. The current state of the art of membranes for MFCs addressed in this review will undoubtedly serve as a key insight for future research related to this topic. © 2021 by the authors.

Of special concern is the exposure of pregnant women and infants, as thyroid disruption of the developing organism may have deleterious effects on neurological outcome. Chemicals may exert thyroid effects through a variety of mechanisms of action, and some animal experiments and in vitro studies have focused on elucidating the mode of action of specific chemical compounds. Long-term human studies on effects of environmental chemicals on thyroid related outcomes such as growth and development are still lacking. The human exposure scenario with life long exposure to a vast mixture of chemicals in low doses and the large physiological variation in thyroid hormone levels between individuals render human studies very difficult.

Aggregates of the involved proteins, independently from their primary sequence, induced neuron membrane permeabilization able to trigger an abnormal Ca2+ influx leading to synaptotoxicity, resulting in reduced expression of synaptic proteins and impaired synaptic transmission. Emerging evidence is now focusing on low‐molecular‐weight pre-fibrillar oligomers (PFOs), which mimic bacterial pore‐forming toxins that form well‐ordered oligo-meric membrane‐spanning pores. At the same time, the neuron membrane composition and its chemical microenvironment seem to play a pivotal role. In fact, the brain of AD patients contains increased fractions of anionic lipids able to favor cationic influx. However, up to now the existence of a specific “common structure” of the toxic aggregate, and a “common mechanism” by which it induces neuronal damage, synaptotoxicity and impaired synaptic transmission, is still an open hy-pothesis. In this review, we gathered information concerning this hypothesis, focusing on the proteins linked to several amyloid diseases.

This review article emphasizes the importance of perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) polymer-based proton exchange membranes (PEMs) for fuel cell applications and their recent achievements, difficulties, and prospects. The most widely used PEMs for low-temperature PEMFCs are PFSA polymer-based membranes and some non-fluorinated polymers such as sulfonated poly(ether ketone) (SPEEK), sulfonated polysulfone (SPSF), sulfonated polyimide (SPI), and sulfonated polystyrene (SPS). Among these PEMs, PFSA membranes (such as Nafion) are the most often utilized low-temperature PEM for fuel cell applications because of their outstanding chemical, mechanical, and thermal stability with higher proton conductivity under-hydrated conditions. Due to some limitations of PFSA membranes, such as poor conductivity in anhydrous conditions, high manufacturing costs, and degradation of their properties at higher temperatures, research on low-temperature PEM has been shifted to the development of polymer electrolyte composite membranes incorporating various multifunctional organic, inorganic, and hybrid fillers. The PFSA polymer composite membranes show better chemical, thermal, and oxidative stability with higher proton conductivity and fuel cell performance than pristine PFSA membranes. In addition, the PFSA polymer composite membranes maintain proton conductivity and fuel cell performance in low humidity conditions. These findings show that developing suitable PFSA polymer composite membranes could enhance the possibility of commercial applications of PEMFCs. © 2022",NA

Due to the persistent, bioaccumulative, long-range transport and potential toxic behaviors, production of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid was voluntarily phased out. Perfluorooctanoic acid, its salt and related compounds were also proposed to be included the Stockholm Convention. Restrictions on production and usage of PFAS chemicals have resulted in emergence of novel PFAS compounds through direct manufacturing emissions and indirect transformation pathways, and increasing attention has been focused on these alternatives. In this review, we summarized recent investigations on major groups of emerging PFASs with various molecular structures, and current analytical strategies on the identification of unknown organic fluoride components were overviewed. Four classes of emerging PFASs are covered, including short-chain perfluoroalkyl substances, cyclic perfluoroalkyl acids, perfluoropolyethers and chlorine or hydrogen-substituted polyfluoroalkyl substances. Current knowledge on molecular structures, production and application, environmental behaviors and potential biological effects are summarized, if available. Known PFASs were noticed as a small part of organic fluorinated compounds in the environment. Consequently, new analytical strategies, such as the mass balance analysis and the oxidative conversion methods, were developed for the analysis of unknown fluorinated components. Mass balance analysis of extractable organic fluorine were used to predict the content of unknown organic fluorine in various environmental matrices including sea water, soil, and human blood. Extractable organic fluorine could be exactly quantified after conversion into inorganic fluoride by high-temperature combustion, and known fluorinated components could also be measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The difference in contents between extractable organic fluorine and known fluorinated components was thus considered as components of unknown organic fluorine. The oxidative conversion method was especially superior for the analysis of fluorinated precursors such as fluorotelomer sulfonates, perfluoroalkane sulfonamides and fluorotelomer phosphate diesters, in which these poly-fluoroalkyl substances could be transformed into known perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) by reaction with hydroxyl radicals at basic conditions. The content of polyfluoroalkyl precursors could be determined by comparing the change of PFCAs contents before and after the oxidation assay. Compared with the mass balance analysis method, this oxidative conversion method require quantification of more PFAS terminal products, and it was not applicable for stable perfluorinated compounds. Meanwhile, occurrence of a variety of novel PFAS analogues have brought challenges on PFAS analysis. For instance, varied molecular structures of emerging PFASs result in distinct physical-chemical properties, which further complicate the analytical process including sample pretreatment and chromatographic isolation. Development of additional methods, such as hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) for the analysis of short chain PFASs and orthogonal liquid chromatography for the analysis of zwitterionic, cationic, and anionic fluorinated chemicals, are urgently needed. Statistical tools including mass spectrum deconvolution, peak picking, alignment and feature filtering would be promising for confirmation of novel PFAS molecular structures. Also, environmental transformation of PFAS precursors are still ambiguous. Application of strategies in metabolomics analysis might facilitate studies on degradation mechanism of PFAS chemicals. © 2017, Science Press.

Genetic susceptibility to TB in HIV negative subjects is well documented. Since coinfections can influence the way in which immune system respond to different pathogens, genetic susceptibility to TB in HIV patients might also change. Studies from India and other parts of the world have shown that genetic susceptibility to TB is influenced by HIV infection. In the present review, we emphasize the role of genetic factors in determining susceptibility to HIV infection, disease progression and development of TB in HIV-infected patients. Polymorphisms in human leukocyte antigen (HLA), MBL2, CD209, vitamin D receptor, cytokine, chemokine and chemokine receptor genes have been shown to be associated with development of TB in HIV patients. However, the results are inconclusive and larger well-defined studies with precise clinical data are required to validate these associations. Apart from candidate gene approach, genome-wide association studies are also needed to unravel the unknown or to establish the previously reported genetic associations with HIV associated TB. Despite the preliminary status of the reported associations, it is becoming clear that susceptibility to development of TB in HIV patients is influenced by both environmental and genetic components. Understanding the genetic and immunologic factors that influence susceptibility to TB in HIV patients could lead to novel insights for vaccine development as well as diagnostic advances to target treatment to those who are at risk for developing active disease. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast to granulomatous diseases and aneurysms of the ascending thoracic aorta, which have decreased, the incidence of benign tumors is essentially unchanged. Clinical features of superior vena cava obstruction in relation to the anatomical site of obstruction and collateral pathways are correlated. Diagnostic approaches, including angiography and technetium scanning, are usually definitive in outlining the site of obstruction. Experimental data and the numerous available techniques for surgical correction indicate that an entirely satisfactory procedure is not available for all patients.

Perfluorochemicals have also been detected in human and animals due to direct or indirect exposures, giving rise to health concerns. This review aims to examine the bioremediation of perfluorochemicals with plants, bacteria and fungi, including their efficiency and limitations. It also aims to propose the future prospects of bioremediation of perfluorochemicals. This review retrieved peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2010 and 2021 from journal databases consisting of Web of Science, Scopus and ScienceDirect. This review shows that multiple Pseudomonas species could degrade perfluorochemicals particularly perfluoroalkyl acids under aerobic condition. Acidimicrobium sp. degraded perfluoroalkyl acids anaerobically in the presence of electron donors. A mixed Pseudomonas culture was more effective than pure cultures. Multiple plants were found to bioconcentrate perfluorochemicals and many demonstrated the ability to hyperaccumulate perfluoroalkyl acids, particularly Festuca rubra, Salix nigra and Betula nigra. Fungal species, particularly Pseudeurotium sp. and Geomyces sp., have the potential to degrade perfluorooctanoic acid or perfluorooctane sulphonic acid. Perfluorochemicals bioremediation could be advanced with identification of more candidate species for bioremediation, optimization of bioremediation conditions, mixed culturing, experiments with environmental media and studies on the biochemical pathways of biotransformation.

These β-oxidation systems may play different physiological roles in the cell. Peroxisomal β-oxidation system has been demonstrated to participate in the catabolism of intarcellular acyl compounds such as very long chain fatty acids, long chain dicarboxylic acids and bile acid precursors in addition to fatty acids. The difference of functions between mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation systems is mainly due to the difference of characteristics of enzymes participating in the β-oxidation in both organella. We have studied the β-oxidation of xenobiotic acyl compounds and found that the peroxisomal β-oxidation is involved in the chain-shortening of acyl side chains of several compounds.

The crucial step in activating the complement system is the generation and regulation of C3 convertase complexes, which are needed to generate opsonins that promote phagocytosis, to generate C3a that regulates inflammation, and to initiate the lytic terminal pathway through the generation and activity of C5 convertases. A growing body of evidence has highlighted the interplay between the complement system, coagulation system, platelets, neutrophils, and endothelial cells. The kidneys are highly susceptible to complement-mediated injury in several genetic, infectious, and autoimmune diseases. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and lupus nephritis (LN) are both characterized by thrombosis in the glomerular capillaries of the kidneys. In aHUS, congenital or acquired defects in complement regulators may trigger platelet aggregation and activation, resulting in the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the kidneys. Because glomerular vasculopathy is usually noted with immunoglobulin and complement accumulation in LN, complement-mediated activation of tissue factors could partly explain the autoimmune mechanism of thrombosis. Thus, kidney glomerular capillary thrombosis is mediated by complement dysregulation and may also be associated with complement overactivation. Further investigation is required to clarify the interaction between these vascular components and develop specific therapeutic approaches.

A biorefinery based on palm oil and oil palm biomass for the production of biofuels has been proposed. The catalytic technology plays major role in the different processing stages in a biorefinery for the production of liquid as well as gaseous biofuels. There are number of challenges to find suitable catalytic technology to be used in a typical biorefinery. These challenges include (1) economic barriers, (2) catalysts that facilitate highly selective conversion of substrate to desired products and (3) the issues related to design, operation and control of catalytic reactor. Therefore, the catalytic technology is one of the critical factors that control the successful operation of biorefinery. There are number of catalytic processes in a biorefinery which convert the renewable feedstocks into the desired biofuels. These include biodiesel production from palm oil, catalytic cracking of palm oil for the production of biofuels, the production of hydrogen as well as syngas from biomass gasification, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) for the conversion of syngas into liquid fuels and upgrading of liquid/gas fuels obtained from liquefaction/pyrolysis of biomass. The selection of catalysts for these processes is essential in determining the product distribution (olefins, paraffins and oxygenated products). The integration of catalytic technology with compatible separation processes is a key challenge for biorefinery operation from the economic point of view.

Available data dealing with the sources, occurrence and removal of EPs within the MENA region in different categories of water is collected, presented and analyzed in this literature review. According to the collected database, the occurrence and removal efficiency of EPs in the water matrix in the MENA region is available, respectively, for 13 and six countries of the 18 in total; no available data is registered for the rest. Altogether, 290 EPs have been observed in different water matrices across the MENA countries, stemming mainly from industrial effluents, agricultural practices, and discharge or reuse of treated wastewater (TWW). Pharmaceutical compounds figure among the most frequently reported compounds in wastewater, TWW, surface water, and drinking water. Nevertheless, pesticides are the most frequently detected pollutants in groundwater. Worryingly, 57 cases of EPs have been reported in different fresh and drinking waters, exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) and European Commission (EC) thresholds. Overall, pharmaceuticals, organic compounds, and pesticides are the most concerning EP groups. The review revealed the ineffectiveness of treatment processes used in the region to remove EPs. Negative removals of some EPs such as carbamazepine, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole were recorded, suggesting their possible accumulation or release during treatment. This underlines the need to set in place and strengthen control measures, treatment procedures, standards, and policies for such pollutants in the region. © 2021, The Author(s).","European Commission; freshwater; literature review; pollutant removal; wastewater treatment; water pollution; water quality; Middle East; North Africa; drug; ground water; environmental monitoring; pollutant; wastewater; water pollutant; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Groundwater; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Elements of the FTS are pathophysiologically linked, leading to several disease risks and even to mortality. In spite of the considerable knowledge about sports nutrition, there is no consensus as to the correct nutrition regime for the female athlete. There is consensus that minimizing fluctuations in 'target-body-weight' is an indication of a long-term energy balance. Female athletes (e.g. in endurance events and gymnastics) are less likely to achieve the recommended carbohydrates (CHO) and fat consumption due to chronic or episodic constraints of total energy intake while struggling to achieve or maintain low levels of body fat. It is recommended that dietary CHO and fat content be increased to preserve fat-free mass thus enhancing health and performance. Energy balance should also be maintained during recesses.

Activation of the complement system via classical, lectin, or alternative pathways generates anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) and membrane attack complex (C5b-9) and opsonizes targeted cells. Complement activation end products and their receptors mediate cell-cell interactions that regulate several biological functions in the extravascular tissue. Signaling of anaphylatoxin receptors or assembly of membrane attack complex promotes cell dedifferentiation, proliferation, and migration in addition to reducing apoptosis. As a result, complement activation in the tumor microenvironment enhances tumor growth and increases metastasis.

Some novel amine-boranes R(CF3)2B·NHMe2 with R = CF3, C2F5, C4F9, C6F5, F2C=CF, CF3-FC=CF that are precursor molecules for the borates are reported; cleavage of their BN bond by NEt3 × 3HF furnishes fluoroborates [R(CF3)2BF]-. Cyanomethylborates [R(CF3)2BCH2CN]- with R = t-Bu, C6H5, F2C=CF, CH2CN result from reaction of NCCH2(CF3)2B·NMe3 with RLi. The well-known aminoborate [(CF3)3BNH2]- reacts with OCl- and OBr- to yield N,N-dihalogenoaminoborates [(CF3)3BNX2]- (X = Cl and Br), which can be fluorinated to form the N,N-difluoroborate anion [(CF3)3BNF2]-. Condensation of [(CF3)3BNH2]- with ONRf yields diazenidoborates [(CF3)3BN=NRf]-. The fluoroborate [(CF3)3BF]- is obtained by fluorination of [(CF3)3BNF2]- or by pyrolysis of [(CF3)3BN=NRf]-, whereas [(CF3)3BX]- (X = Cl and Br) are formed when dihalogenoaminoborates [(CF3)3BNX2]- are pyrolyzed. Nitroborates [Rf(CF3)2BNO2]- and [(C2F5)3BNO2]- are accessible by ozone oxidation of the corresponding dimethylamine-boranes.

NA,Children's environmental health based on birth cohort studies of Asia,2017,NA,NA,"Numerous studies have explored the associations between environmental pollutants and pediatric health. Recent studies have investigated the issue in Asia, but no systematic review has been published to date. This study aims to elucidate the issue by summarizing relevant epidemiologic evidence for cohorts in Asia, using information from the Birth Cohort Consortium of Asia (BiCCA). Environmental pollutants include mercury, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and phthalates. This study sought to classify the effects of such compounds on fetal growth and pregnancy outcomes, neurodevelopment and behavioral problems, allergic disease and immune function and the endocrine system and puberty. These evidences showed ETS has been associated with infant birth weight, children's neurodevelopment and allergy disease; mercury and PCB have been shown to affect children's neurodevelopment; phthalate has effects on endocrine function; PFAS alters children's neurodevelopment, the endocrine system, and the allergic response. However, more consistent and coordinated research is necessary to understand the whole picture of single environmental and/or co-exposure and children's health. Therefore, harmonization and international collaboration are also needed in Asia. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",NA

Industrial chemical production has increased over the past 30 to 40 years. Basic science, animal models, and epidemiologic data suggest that certain chemicals may act as endocrine disruptors (substances that interfere with normal hormonal action) and may play an etiologic role in a number of conditions whose incidence has also increased during this same period. These include low birth weight, gestational diabetes, obesity, certain cancers, certain birth defects, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit disorder and autism. In addition, some environmental chemicals may have epigenetic effects, resulting in transgenerational health impacts. The epidemiologic and experimental evidence that links chemicals such as plasticizers (eg, phthalates and phenols), flame retardants, perfluorinated compounds, and pesticides with adverse reproductive health outcomes is reviewed. Women's health care providers are the liaison between scientific research and their patients; they should educate themselves on the significance of environmental toxins to health. They are ideally positioned, not only to counsel and reassure pregnant women, but also to suggest practicable changes in dietary and lifestyle habits to improve their health. Furthermore, women's health care providers should advocate for regulatory changes that protect women and their families from the health effects of environmental toxins. © 2016 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; endocrine disruptor; environmental chemical; flame retardant; perfluoro compound; pesticide; phenol; phthalic acid; plasticizer; attention deficit disorder; autism; congenital malformation; developmental disorder; environmental health; epigenetics; health care personnel; health impact assessment; human; incidence; lifestyle; low birth weight; neoplasm; neurologic disease; obesity; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnant woman; priority journal; reproductive health; Review"

The most commonly studied PFASs are perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Animal studies indicate that maternal PFAS exposure is associated with reduced fetal growth. However, the results of human studies are inconsistent. Objectives: To summarize the evidence of an association between exposure to PFASs, particularly PFOS and PFOA, and human fetal growth. Methods: Systematic literature searches were performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE. We included original studies on pregnant women with measurements of PFOA or PFOS in maternal blood during pregnancy or the umbilical cord and associations with birth weight or related outcomes according to the PFAS level. Citations and references from the included articles were investigated to locate more relevant articles. Study characteristics and results were extracted to structured tables. The completeness of reporting as well as the risk of bias and confounding were assessed. Results: Fourteen studies were eligible. In utero PFOA exposure was associated with decreased measures of continuous birth weight in all studies, even though the magnitude of the association differed and many results were statistically insignificant. PFOS exposure and birth weight were associated in some studies, while others found no association. Conclusions: Higher PFOS and PFOA concentrations were associated with decreased average birth weight in most studies, but only some results were statistically significant. The impact on public health is unclear, but the global exposure to PFASs warrants further investigation. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pollutant; birth weight; cord serum; environmental exposure; fetus growth; gestational age; human; low birth weight; maternal blood; outcome assessment; pregnant woman; Review; small for date infant; umbilical cord; adverse effects; animal; drug effects; female; fetus development; pollutant; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; toxicity; Animalia; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Birth Weight; Caprylates; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fetal Development; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome

Due to their extensive use and chemical stability, PFAS are ubiquitous environmental contaminants and as such, form an emerging risk factor for male reproductive health. The long half-lives of PFAS is of particular concern as the propensity to accumulate in biological systems prolong the time taken for excretion, taking years in many cases. Accordingly, there is mounting evidence supporting a negative association between PFAS exposure and an array of human health conditions. However, inconsistencies among epidemiological and experimental findings have hindered the ability to definitively link negative reproductive outcomes to specific PFAS exposure. This situation highlights the requirement for further investigation and the identification of reliable biological models that can inform health risks, allowing sensitive assessment of the spectrum of effects of PFAS exposure on humans. Here, we review the literature on the biological effects of PFAS exposure, with a specific focus on male reproduction, owing to its utility as a sentinel marker of general health. Indeed, male infertility has increasingly been shown to serve as an early indicator of a range of co-morbidities such as coronary, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases. It follows that adverse associations have been established between PFAS exposure and the incidence of testicular dysfunction, including pathologies such as testicular cancer and a reduction in semen quality. We also give consideration to the mechanisms that render the male reproductive tract vulnerable to PFAS mediated damage, and discuss novel remediation strategies to mitigate the negative impact of PFAS contamination and/or to ameliorate the PFAS load of exposed individuals.

NA,"Perfluorohexanoic acid toxicity, part I: Development of a chronic human health toxicity value for use in risk assessment",2019,NA,NA,"Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) is a short-chain, six-carbon perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) and is a primary impurity, degradant, and metabolite associated with the short-chain fluorotelomer-based chemistry used globally today. The transition to short-chain fluorotelomer-based products as a cornerstone in replacement fluorochemistry has raised questions regarding potential human health risks associated with exposure to fluorotelomer-based substances and therefore, PFHxA. Here, we present a critical review of data relevant to such a risk assessment, including epidemiological studies and in vivo and in vitro toxicity studies that examined PFHxA acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicity. Key findings from toxicokinetic and mode-of-action studies are also evaluated. Sufficient data exist to conclude that PFHxA is not carcinogenic, is not a selective reproductive or developmental toxicant, and does not disrupt endocrine activity. Collectively, effects caused by PFHxA exposure are largely limited to potential kidney effects, are mild and/or reversible, and occur at much higher doses than observed for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). A chronic human-health-based oral reference dose (RfD) for PFHxA of 0.25 mg/kg-day was calculated using benchmark dose modeling of renal papillary necrosis from a chronic rat bioassay. This RfD is four orders of magnitude greater than the chronic oral RfD calculated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for PFOA. The PFHxA RfD can be used to inform public health decisions related to PFHxA and fluorotelomer precursors for which PFHxA is a terminal degradant. These findings clearly demonstrate that PFHxA is less hazardous to human health than PFOA. The analyses presented support site-specific risk assessments as well as product stewardship initiatives for current and future short-chain fluorotelomer-based products. © 2019 The Authors",NA

In this review, persulfate activation methods and operational factors in persulfate-based PFOA / PFOS degradation are analyzed and summarized. Moreover, the decomposing mechanisms of PFOA and PFOS are outlined in terms of molecular structures based a series of proposed pathways. PFOS could be converted to PFOA with the attack of SO4[rad]− and OH[rad]. And then PFOA defluorination occurs with one CF2 unit missing in each round and the similar procedure would occur continuously with sufficient SO4[rad]− and OH[rad] until entire decomposition.

We have contributed to this multi-faceted, worldwide effort with the development of predictors for GPI lipid anchor sites, for N-terminal N-myristoylation sites, for farnesyl and geranylgeranyl anchor attachment as well as for the PTS1 peroxisomal signal. Although the substrate protein sequence signals for various PTMs or translocation systems vary dramatically, we found that their principal architecture is similar for all the cases studied. Typically, a small stretch of the amino acid residues is buried in the catalytic cleft of the protein-modifying enzyme (or the binding site of the transporter). This piece most intensely interacts with the enzyme and its sequence variability is most restricted. This stretch is surrounded by linker segments that connect the part bound by the enzyme with the rest of the substrate protein. These residues are, as a trend, small with a flexible backbone and polar. Due to the mechanistic requirements of binding to the enzyme, we suggest that most PTM sites are necessarily embedded into intrinsically disordered regions (except for cases of autocatalytic PTMs, PTMs executed in the unfolded state or non-enzymatic PTMs) and this issue requires consideration in structural studies of proteins with complex architecture. Surprisingly, some proteins carry sequence signals for posttranslational modification or translocation that remain hidden in the normal biological context but can become fully functional in certain conditions. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","amino acid; carrier protein; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; copper amine oxidase; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; enzyme; erythropoietin receptor; globular protein; glycosylphosphatidylinositol; interleukin 12; oxidoreductase; properdin; ribonuclease; tryptophan; tyrosine; unclassified drug; amino acid sequence; amino terminal sequence; binding site; catalysis; cellular distribution; computer aided design; enzyme degradation; enzyme substrate complex; myristylation; peroxisome; prediction; protein farsenylation; protein folding; protein function; protein geranylgeranylation; protein localization; protein modification; protein motif; protein phosphorylation; protein processing; protein protein interaction; protein structure; protein transport; review; sensitivity and specificity; sequence analysis; signal transduction; Amino Acid Sequence; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Conformation; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Proteins; Signal Transduction; Subcellular Fractions"
NA,Assfociations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with lower birth weight: An evaluation of potential confounding by glomerular filtration rate using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK),2015,NA,NA,"BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been associated with lower birth weight in epidemiologic studies. This association could be attributable to glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is related to PFAS concentration and birth weight. OBJECTIVES: We used a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of pregnancy to assess how much of the PFAS–birth weight association observed in epidemiologic studies might be attributable to GFR. METHODS: We modified a PBPK model to reflect the association of GFR with birth weight (estimated from three studies of GFR and birth weight) and used it to simulate PFAS concentrations in maternal and cord plasma. The model was run 250,000 times, with variation in parameters, to simulate a population. Simulated data were analyzed to evaluate the association between PFAS levels and birth weight due to GFR. We compared simulated estimates with those from a meta-analysis of epidemiologic data. RESULTS: The reduction in birth weight for each 1-ng/mL increase in simulated cord plasma for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was 2.72 g (95% CI: –3.40, –2.04), and for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was 7.13 g (95% CI: –8.46, –5.80); results based on maternal plasma at term were similar. Results were sensitive to variations in PFAS level distributions and the strength of the GFR–birth weight association. In comparison, our meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies suggested that each 1-ng/mL increase in prenatal PFOS and PFOA levels was associated with 5.00 g (95% CI: –21.66, –7.78) and 14.72 g (95% CI: –8.92, –1.09) reductions in birth weight, respectively. CONCLUSION: Results of our simulations suggest that a substantial proportion of the association between prenatal PFAS and birth weight may be attributable to confounding by GFR and that confounding by GFR may be more important in studies with sample collection later in pregnancy. © 2015 Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

NA,Environmental toxicants in the brain: A review of astrocytic metabolic dysfunction,2021,NA,NA,"Exposure to environmental toxicants is linked to long-term adverse outcomes in the brain and involves the dysfunction of glial and neuronal cells. Astrocytes, the most numerous cell type, are increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases of the central nervous system, including neurodegenerative diseases. Astrocytes are critical for proper brain function in part due to their robust antioxidant and unique metabolic capabilities. Additionally, astrocytes are positioned both at the blood-brain barrier, where they are the primary responders to xenobiotic penetrance of the CNS, and at synapses where they are in close contact with neurons and synaptic machinery. While exposure to several classes of environmental toxicants, including chlorinated and fluorinated compounds, and trace metals, have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, their impact on astrocytes represents an important and growing field of research. Here, we review existing literature focused on the impact of a range of synthetic compounds on astrocytic function.

Due to the lack of strategies, regioselective functionalization of 9-hydroxyphenanthrene is very challenging, especially on C1-C8 sites. In order to promote the application of phenanthrene, this review summarizes the methods for regioselective functionalization of 9-hydroxyphenanthrene and its ether derivatives on different sites. The corresponding reaction mechanisms are introduced in detail. We also provide the reaction characteristics of 9-hydroxyphenanthrene, and we offer our views on the challenges and the future research direction of 9-hydroxyphenanthrene.

Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are emerging pollutants which possess adverse ecological risk. In this review, we have compiled the data on the levels of PFAAs in environmental samples, mainly in estuarine and coastal zones. A worldwide map was generated to show the distribution of PFAAs. The experimental results have also been considered, which, together with those of environmental samples, has allowed us to infer about the factors that intervene in the behavior of PFAAs. The presence of PFAAs is determined primarily by the source of pollution. Salinity is as well shown as a significant condition, dependent too on the sampling environment. The analysis of PFAAs from environmental samples constitutes a fundamental tool for the surveillance of these pollutants, but the lack of homogeneity of protocols for sampling, as well as for the results presentation, limits the comparative capacity. Laboratory studies are also an essential tool in the analysis of particular aspects related to PFAAs, but many times the conditions tested are not environmentally significant. In this way, it would not be prudent to establish “paradigms” about the behavior of the PFAAs in certain areas or organisms, instead to suggest the points that can be considered fundamental for each issue addressed. The main variables that appear to intervene in estuarine and coastal regions are mainly the proximity to the source of pollution, salinity, pH, precipitation (rain) as well as types of PFAAs. All these can synergistically lead to different impacts on the ecosystem. Therefore, the particular risks of PFAAs in estuarine and coastal regions is a set of multiple variables, dependent on each sampling condition and according to the previously named parameters. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Estuaries; Pollution; Rain; Ecological values; Emerging pollutants; Environmental factors; Environmental sample; Laboratory studies; Perfluoroalkyl acids; Results presentation; Sampling conditions; Coastal zones; aquatic organism; chemical pollutant; coastal zone; environmental factor; estuarine pollution; estuarine sediment; organohalogen; pollutant source; salinity; spatial distribution; toxicity; aquatic species; coastal waters; environmental factor; estuary; human; nonhuman; pollutant; precipitation; review; salinity; seashore; sediment

In this review, the possible consequences on human health of DU released in the environment are critically analyzed. In the first part, the chemical properties of DU and the principal civil and military uses are summarized. A concise analysis of the mechanisms underlying absorption, blood transport, tissue distribution and excretion of DU in the human body is the subject of the second part of this article. The following sections deal with pathological condition putatively associated with overexposure to DU. Developmental and birth defects, the Persian Gulf syndrome, and kidney diseases that have been associated to DU are the arguments treated in the third section. Finally, data regarding DU exposure and cancer insurgence will be critically analyzed, including leukemia/lymphoma, lung cancer, uterine cervix cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer and testicular cancer.

These agents include air, gas (sulfur hexafluoride [SF6], hexafluoroethane [C2F6], and perfluoropropane [C3F8]), and silicone oil. The optimal tamponade agent is uncertain, and we aimed to review the effect of tamponade choice on hole closure and visual outcomes. Clinical relevance: Although most surgeons initially chose to use long-acting gas (C3F8), there has been a gradual change in practice to the increasing use of the medium- (C2F6) and short-acting gases (SF6) or even air. However, there is no consensus regarding their relative efficacies. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective and retrospective comparative cohort studies comparing different tamponade agents in patients undergoing vitrectomy and ILM peeling for primary idiopathic macular holes. For RCTs, the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs, whereas for nonrandomized studies, the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool was used. Results: Thirteen publications, including 2 RCTs, were identified. Overall, there was no significant difference in the anatomic closure rates between studies using SF6 compared with either C3F8 or C2F6 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51–1.08). A subgroup analysis showed a significantly higher closure rate using SF6 (OR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.30–0.79) in patients without postoperative posturing but not in those who were advised to posture facedown. The visual outcomes and adverse events were not significantly different. The comparisons of anatomic closure rates of patients treated with gas tamponade vs. silicone oil and with air vs. SF6 showed no significant differences. The included studies had a number of methodological limitations and heterogeneities, making conclusions imprecise, with low or very low certainty by the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Conclusion: The current evidence base for tamponade selection with vitrectomy and ILM peeling for full-thickness macular hole has several major limitations. Further appropriately designed studies are needed to guide tamponade selection. © 2022 American Academy of Ophthalmology",chemical compound; hexafluoroethane; perflutren; silicone oil; sulfur hexafluoride; unclassified drug; adverse event; air; body position; cataract; consensus; data base; data extraction; gas; GRADE approach; human; idiopathic disease; internal limiting membrane; meta analysis; outcome assessment; prospective study; publication; randomized controlled trial (topic); retina macula hole; Review; risk assessment; selection bias; surgeon; systematic review; vision; vitrectomy; retina; retina tear; visual acuity; vitrectomy; Humans; Retina; Retinal Perforations; Silicone Oils; Visual Acuity; Vitrectomy

Radical-mediated transformations of α-haloamides bearing a suitable located unsaturated bond has proven to be a straightforward alternative to access diverse cyclic compounds by means of either radical initiators, transition metal redox catalysis or visible light photoredox catalysis. On the other hand, cycloadditions with α-halohydroxamate-based azaoxyallyl cations have garnered significant attention.

The exchange of water between the surface-subsurface generates the hyporheic exchange flow: the engine that drives the ecological functioning of the HZ. The magnitude and direction of hydrological fluxes in the HZ follow complex spatial patterns, strongly influenced by the temporal dynamics of surface flow in rivers.2) The direction and magnitude of hydrological fluxes also shapes the structure of hyporheic communities (hyporheos). During surface disturbances such as flooding or drought, benthic organisms may also use the HZ as a refuge, although the importance of this role is debated.3) Streambed organisms differ in their ability to colonize the HZ depending on the biological traits they possess. The reduction in oxygen concentration and pore size with increasing sediment depth imposes a limit on the distribution of macroinvertebrates, which are replaced by a suite of smaller organisms (meiofauna and protists) at deeper sediment layers. Therefore, a concomitant reduction in net biomass and productivity might be expected through depth. However, only a few studies have assessed the contribution of the hyporheos to whole system production, and they have focused only on the fraction of relatively large organisms.4) The bioreactor ability of the HZ to transform nutrients and pollutants is an important ecosystem service sustained by the life activities of hyporheos. Biofilms have the key role in this process due to their capacity to metabolize a wide range of dissolved compounds, including emerging pollutants. However, the residence time of water in pore sediments (resulting from hyporheic exchange flow) and the rest of the community (constantly reworking the sediments and grazing biofilms) are indirectly involved. © 2017",Biofilms; Biological water treatment; Bioremediation; Ecosystems; Hydrology; Nutrients; Pore size; Residence time distribution; Sediments; Concomitant reduction; Ecological functioning; Ecosystem services; Hyporheic exchange flow; Macroinvertebrates; Meiofauna; Micropollutants; Oxygen concentrations; Stream flow; biofilm; biological production; bioremediation; community ecology; ecosystem service; hydrology; hyporheic zone; macroinvertebrate; meiofauna; nutrient cycling; attenuation; biofilm; biomass; community ecology; drought; flooding; hydrodynamics; hydrology; hyporheic zone; macroinvertebrate; meiofauna; nonhuman; pollutant; priority journal; protist; Review; river; seasonal variation; stream (river); water flow; Protista

The present work reviews the latest findings on the formation of Medox from the reactions of synthetic (i.e., 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonate (ABTS) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT)) or natural mediators (i.e., syringaldehyde (SA), acetosyringone (AS), p-coumaric acid, and catechol) with mild oxidants such as laccase, manganese oxidants including permanganate (Mn(VII)) and MnO2, and ferrate (Fe(VI)), as well as the transformation of organic pollutants including phenols, amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organic dyes, pulp, and perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) by Medox. First, reaction kinetics and mechanisms of the oxidation of synthetic or natural mediators by these mild oxidants were summarized. Reactivity and pathways of synthetic Medox including ABTS·+, ABTS2+, HBT· or natural Medox including phenoxy radicals and quinone-type compounds reacting with different organic pollutants were then discussed.

Its role and efficacy depend on factors related to the stent, procedure, and patient. Goals: To review the evidence in the literature in which settings plastic or metal stents are cost-effective, and whether adjuvant measures or patient-related factors affect duration of stent patency. Study: Using databases a literature search was performed for papers published from 1979 to April 2004. All retrieved papers reporting experimental or clinical observations were rated according to strength of evidence, and carefully analyzed. Results and Conclusions: Metal stents (Wallstent) stay patent longer than plastic stents (large-bore polyethylene with side-holes), overall median 250 and 110 days, respectively, and seem cost-effective in patients with longer than about 6 months survival, which cannot be accurately predicted. Antibiotics or choleretic agents do not prolong stent patency in clinical settings. In case of stent occlusion, indicated stent exchanges and insertion of a plastic stent, respectively, seem cost-effective in patients initially treated with plastic and metal stents.

We estimate emissions of 2610-21400 tonnes of C4-C14 PFCAs in the period from 1951 to 2015, and project 20-6420 tonnes to be emitted from 2016 to 2030. The global annual emissions steadily increased in the period 1951-2002, followed by a decrease and then another increase in the period 2002-2012. Releases from fluoropolymer production contributed most to historical PFCA emissions (e.g. 55-83% in 1951-2002). Since 2002, there has been a geographical shift of industrial sources (particularly fluoropolymer production sites) from North America, Europe and Japan to emerging Asian economies, especially China. Sources differ between PFCA homologues, sometimes considerably, and the relative contributions of each source change over time. For example, whereas 98-100% of historical (1951-2002) PFOA emissions are attributed to direct releases during the life-cycle of products containing PFOA as ingredients or impurities, a much higher historical contribution from PFCA precursor degradation is estimated for some other homologues (e.g. 9-78% for PFDA). We address the uncertainties of the PFCA emissions by defining a lower and a higher emission scenario, which differ by approximately a factor of eight. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Fluorine containing polymers; Life cycle; Global emissions; Industrial sources; Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids; PFOA; Polyfluorinated alkyl substances; Carboxylic acids; carbon 14; carboxylic acid; fluorotelomer; perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctane; perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; atmospheric pollution; carboxylic acid; emission inventory; industrial emission; pollutant source; uncertainty analysis; air pollutant; air pollution; carbon footprint; China; environmental impact assessment; Europe; Japan; life cycle; North America; pollution monitoring; priority journal; review; China; Europe; Japan; North America; Geographical shift of industrial sources; Global emission inventory; Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances; Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs); PFOA; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carboxylic Acids; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons

Our aim was to identify clinical or radiological measures that could assist in predicting a favorable clinical outcome. Methods: Risk factors, clinicoradiological features, and functional outcomes were assessed in 40 patients with vertebrobasilar ischemic stroke whose basilar arteries were absent on MRA. The presence of potential feeding arteries to the posterior circulation was recorded from a review of the MRA data. To permit quantitative analysis of the images, a potential feeding artery score (PFAS; range: 0-8) was established. One point was assigned when a signal was seen from an intracranial vertebral artery, a posterior inferior cerebellar artery, a superior cerebellar artery, or a posterior cerebral artery. On MRI, the location of the infarction was classified as involving the proximal, middle, and distal territories of the intracranial posterior circulation. The infarctions were also categorized as single- or multi-sector infarctions, and according to whether more than one penetrating or branch artery was involved. Clinical outcomes were classified as favorable (modified Rankin Scale = 0-2) or poor (modified Rankin Scale = 3-6). Results: The clinical outcome was favorable in 30% (n = 12) of patients, and poor in 70% (n = 28). A transient ischemic attack preceded the stroke in 48% of patients, especially those with a favorable outcome (67%). Patients with a favorable outcome had a higher PFAS (p = 0.036) and an increased incidence of single-sector infarction (p = 0.049). Conclusions: Our study suggests that a higher PFAS, accompanied by a single-sector infarction, is a predictor of improved clinical outcome in patients with vertebrobasilar ischemic stroke in which the basilar artery was absent on MRA.

Herein, the direct C-H arylation, C-H alkylation, and C-H fluoroalkylation of heteroarenes are represented respectively, providing practical routes to C-C bond formation. 1 Introduction 2 C-H Arylation of Heteroarenes with Aryl Radicals 3 C-H Alkylation of Heteroarenes with Alkyl Radicals 4 C-H Fluoroalkylation of Heteroarenes with Fluorine-Containing Carbon Radicals 5 Concluding Remarks. © 2017 Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart.

First described in 1943, trifluorodiazoethane found its way into the organic synthesis repertoire only in the past decade for atom-economical and practical synthesis of fluorinated building blocks and currently emerges as a versatile reagent. The synthetic applicability of this reagent is currently being investigated in great detail and many interesting new reactivities, and procedures for the synthesis of fluoroalkyl-substituted building blocks have been developed. In this context, a range of new fluoroalkyl substituted diazoalkanes have been introduced in the past few years, ranging from perfluorinated diazoalkanes towards highly reactive difluorodiazoethane which was first described in 2015. This tutorial review covers historic milestones of fluoroalkyl substituted diazoalkanes and highlights recent examples which underscore their vast potential to the synthesis of fluorinated compounds. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",Positive ions; Building blockes; Diazoalkanes; Fluorinated compound; nocv1; Organic synthesis; Chemistry

Activated complement is responsible for the stimulation of a localized protective inflammatory response to either invading microorganisms or foreign molecules (toxins). However, the autologous activation of the complement system can have devastating consequences on many organ systems. This review discusses the various pathways involved in the activation of the complement system and the multiple levels of control established within the body to regulate activation. It also focuses on the role of complement activation in cardiovascular disease, especially myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury as well as in cardiopulmonary bypass procedures. Lastly, this review also provides a comprehensive overview of both biologically derived proteins and chemically developed inhibitors of the complement system that range from those that are currently in the discovery stage to those that are in clinical development as novel therapeutic agents.","apt 070; bcx 1470; berinert p; CD59 antigen; classical complement pathway C3 C5 convertase; cobrotoxin; complement component C1; complement component C1q; complement component C1r; complement component C1s; complement component C1s inhibitor; complement component C3; complement component C3a; complement component C3b receptor; complement component C3d receptor; complement component C4; complement component C4b; complement component C5a receptor; complement component C5b; complement component C8; complement inhibitor; complement membrane attack complex; compstatin; gt 4086; k 76; lectin; nafamstat mesilate; pexelizumab; serine proteinase; tp 10; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; cardiopulmonary bypass; cardiovascular disease; clinical trial; complement activation; complement alternative pathway; complement inhibition; drug research; heart muscle ischemia; human; immunomodulation; nonhuman; pathophysiology; priority journal; reperfusion injury; review; signal transduction; Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; Complement Inactivator Proteins; Complement Membrane Attack Complex; Complement Pathway, Classical; Complement System Proteins; Drug Design; Humans; Lectins"

Dairy products and specific oils such as coconut oil are natural sources of dietary caprylic acid. MCFAs display distinct chemico-physical and metabolic properties from those of long-chain saturated fatty acids (LCFAs ≥ 12 carbons) and potential beneficial physiological effects of dietary C8:0 have been studied for many years. More recently, caprylic acid was shown to octanoylate ghrelin, the only known peptide hormone with an orexigenic effect. Through its covalent binding to the ghrelin peptide, caprylic acid exhibits an emerging and specific role in modulating physiological functions themselves regulated by octanoylated ghrelin. Dietary caprylic acid is therefore now suspected to provide the ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) enzyme with octanoyl-CoA co-substrates necessary for the acyl modification of ghrelin. Recent studies suggest that decreasing the circulating octanoylated ghrelin level through the inhibition of GOAT activity, or simply by modulating the availability of its C8:0 substrate, might constitute a therapeutic strategy against obesity. Both dietary caprylic acid availability and GOAT activity may indeed be important to modulate octanoylated ghrelin concentration and functions.

Water-soluble conjugated polymers have been widely used for protein sensing due to their distinct optical response in the presence of different analytes. This review summarizes the recent developments in water-soluble conjugated polymer-based protein sensors. Based on the different optical responses of conjugated polymers to proteins, these assays are categorized into three groups. The conformational change of cationic poly(thiophene)s is used to generate unique colorimetric or fluorescent transduction upon interaction with target proteins. Super-quenching of water-soluble poly(phenylene vinylene)s and poly(phenylene ethynylene)s has been developed into fluorescence turn-on and turn-off protein assays. Energy transfer between poly(fluorene-co-phenylene) derivatives and acceptor dyes is also utilized to develop fluorescence turn-on protein assays with amplified signal output.

The prevalence of allergic diseases in childhood is gradually increasing all over the world in recent decades. Known causes of these diseases include anomalous immune responses and allergic inflammatory reactions, but the causes of allergic diseases in childhood are complex. Data sources: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Science were searched for articles focusing on environmental exposure during pregnancy and the risk of childhood allergic diseases, including asthma and atopic dermatitis, and the possible underlying mechanism. Results: In terms of environmental factors, allergic diseases in childhood are closely related to environmental chemical exposure during pregnancy, including bisphenols, phthalates acid esters, perfluorochemicals, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and polychlorinated biphenyls. However, allergic diseases in childhood are also closely associated with maternal dietary nutrition, maternal intake of drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), paracetamol and antibiotics, and maternal lifestyle. Conclusions: Several harmful environmental factors during pregnancy can result in the interruption of the function of helper T cells (Th1/Th2), cytokines and immunoglobulins and may activate allergic reactions, which can lead to allergic diseases during childhood. © 2021, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; acetylsalicylic acid; antibiotic agent; environmental chemical; ester; paracetamol; phthalic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; allergic disease; asthma; atopic dermatitis; blood placenta barrier; childhood disease; dietary exposure; environmental exposure; environmental factor; epigenetic modification; human; lifestyle; maternal exposure; maternal nutrition; persistent organic pollutant; pregnancy; prenatal drug exposure; Review; social aspect; adverse event; asthma; atopic dermatitis; diet; environmental exposure; female; hypersensitivity; pregnancy; Asthma; Dermatitis, Atopic; Diet; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Pregnancy"

The Stockholm Convention, a global agreement on POPs, came into force in 2004. There has been a major expansion of measurements and risk assessments of new chemical contaminants in the global environment, particularly brominated diphenyl ethers and perfluorinated alkyl acids. However, the list of chemicals measured represents only a small fraction of the approximately 30,000 chemicals widely used in commerce (>1 t/y). The vast majority of existing and new chemical substances in commerce are not monitored in environmental media. Assessment and screening of thousands of existing chemicals in commerce in the United States, Europe, and Canada have yielded lists of potentially persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals. Here we review recent screening and categorization studies of chemicals in commerce and address the question of whether there is now sufficient information to permit a broader array of chemicals to be determined in environmental matrices. For example, Environment Canada's recent categorization of the Domestic (existing) Substances list, using a wide array of quantitative structure activity relationships for PB&T characteristics, has identified about 5.5% of 11,317 substances as meeting P & B criteria. Using data from the Environment Canada categorization, we have listed, for discussion purposes, 30 chemicals with high predicted bioconcentration and low rate of biodegradation and 28 with long range atmospheric transport potential based on predicted atmospheric oxidation half-lives >2 days and log air-water partition coefficients ≥5 and ≤1. These chemicals are a diverse group including halogenated organics, cyclic siloxanes, and substituted aromatics. Some of these chemicals and their transformation products may be candidates for future environmental monitoring. However, to improve these predictions data on emissions from end use are needed to refine environmental fate predictions, and analytical methods may need to be developed. © 2006 American Chemical Society.","Environmental impact; Ethers; Risk assessment; Toxic materials; Alkyl acids; Environmental chemists; Global measurement; Environmental engineering; alkyl group; aromatic compound; bromine derivative; diphenyl ether; halogen; organic compound; perfluoro compound; siloxane; Environmental engineering; Environmental impact; Ethers; Risk assessment; Toxic materials; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; bioaccumulation; biodegradation; environmental fate; environmental monitoring; measurement method; organic pollutant; persistence; risk assessment; toxicity; atmospheric transport; bioaccumulation; biodegradation; Canada; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; Europe; half life time; organic pollution; oxidation; partition coefficient; quantitative analysis; review; risk assessment; screening; United States; Biodegradation, Environmental; Canada; Chemistry, Analytical; Commerce; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Organic Chemicals; Risk Assessment; Canada; Eurasia; Europe; North America; United States"

PFCs have been detected in drinking water samples, aquatic life, human tissue, and blood serum. This is attributed to their xenobiotic attributes making them environmentally persistent, bio-accumulative, and globally distributed in water receiving bodies, posing serious health problems to aquatic life and human health. This is ascribed to PFCs’ peculiar physicochemical properties of being hydrophobic and oleophobic and their removal process from wastewater streams is different from any other organic pollutants. Therefore, this review summarizes the environmental occurrence and recent developments on microbial degradation of the most detected PFCs, i.e., perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) in water bodies. The available literature suggests that PFOA and PFOS are susceptible to biodegradation by Acidimicrobium sp. strain A6, Pseudomonas parafulva strain YAB1, Pseudomonas plecoglossicidia 2.4-D, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain HJ4. Moreover, the current study presents a summary on phytoremediation of PFOA and PFOS as a sustainable green technology. Despite the extensive work undertaken on bioremediation of PFOA and PFOS by biological processes, the available literature suggests that a lot of work still needs to be carried out aimed at investigating the biodegradation pathway of PFOA and PFOS by both microbial species and plants. © 2022 by the authors.",NA

The approval of Fluosol, a fluorocarbon emulsion for oxygenating the myocardium during the transluminal coronary angioplasty procedure, is a landmark in the field of injectable oxygen carriers, the so‐called blood substitutes. This review discusses the advances made since this first emulsion was initially developed about 12 years ago. Attention is focused on the progress achieved in the preparation and selection of new, better‐defined and faster‐excreted fluorocarbons, and better surfactants, improved emulsions, knowledge of structure/property relationships along with an improved understanding of the physiologic response to their administration. These advances have led to the development of a second generation of highly concentrated, fluid and stable injectable oxygen carriers suitable for a broad range of clinical applications. Prospects for further progress and future generations of emulsions are also outlined. © 1991 S.

A quantitative analysis of the disaggregating of filter cakes under shear into concentrated suspensions is proposed. Two rheological models were used: an Herschel-Bulkley model to relate the relative viscosity to the shear rate, a modified Krieger and Dougherty model to relate the relative viscosity to the solid concentration at given shear rate. The maximum packing fraction of particles in the cakes was estimated as well as the ratio between the aggregates and the particle size rf/rp. This ratio logically declines with the intensity of shear. It shows that an advanced cake disaggregating was obtained for low shear rates of 10 s-1. Two processes of filtration-compression were also compared: a filtration of deflocculated suspension (FDS) and an innovative precoat filtration of deflocculated suspension (PFDS). The results showed that PFDS improved the cake dryness and specific resistance as well as the flowability of the final concentrated suspension. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered the most widely used drugs worldwide and over the counter. The lack of legal norms that limit emission ranges in water bodies has been one of the main factors in the increase of these emerging pollutants (EC) in aquatic ecosystems. Studies based on the monitoring of these pharmaceutical compounds allow us to understand all aspects related to fate, concentration, distribution, effects, and physiological alterations that they cause in aquatic biota, for this reason, it is necessary to highlight the importance of bivalves as organisms, model and bioindicators. This review presents an overview of ecotoxicological studies that monitor NSAIDs and evaluates the responses of some species of bivalves in biomonitoring programs and toxicity tests. Negative effects of NSAIDs have been reported in aquatic environments to wild bivalves, in addition to causing biomagnification. With this study, it is expected to promote interest in scientific research in this little-explored area necessary for pharmacovigilance and biomonitoring of aquatic ecosystems. © 2022 Asociacion Espanola de Ecologia Terrestre.

It can reduce the dependence on petroleum imports and ensure national energy strategy security. Cobalt-based catalysts have become one of the most widely studied Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalysts due to their outstanding catalytic activity, high chain growth factor, low CO2 selectivity, and long life. How to adjust the surface and interface properties of the catalyst to break the dependence of reduction and dispersion, and improve the reaction activity and product selectivity within a certain carbon chain range is still a significant challenge for the development of high-performance cobalt-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalysts. In this paper, the latest research progress in the regulation of the surface and interface properties of cobalt-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalysts is reviewed from three aspects: structure sensitivity (size and crystal effect), metal-support interaction, and confinement effect, so as to provide a theoretical basis for the design of catalyst microstructure and regulation of reaction performance. © 2022 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

It has been used in a wide range of industrial and consumer products for decades. The unique properties of PFOS, including its stability and resistance to degradation, have made it highly persistent in the aquatic environment. Because of its persistence, potential toxicity, and occurrence in aquatic ecosystems, interest in PFOS has increased in recent decades. Despite this interest, current information on the environmental distribution of PFOS in ambient surface waters of the United States is fairly limited. This critical review summarizes the currently available literature on PFOS occurrence in surface waters across the United States and highlights existing data gaps. Available data are largely from a handful of study areas with known PFAS manufacturing or industrial uses, with much of the data collected from freshwater systems in eastern states and the upper Midwest. Measured PFOS concentrations in surface waters vary widely, over 8 orders of magnitude, with the highest concentrations occurring downstream from manufacturing and industrial use plants, areas near aqueous film-forming foam–use sites, and sites where PFOS precursors were used in textile treatment. Non–point source–related occurrences are highest near urbanized areas with high population densities. Current data illustrate the occurrence of PFOS in surface waters across multiple US states. Additional data are needed to better understand PFOS occurrence in US aquatic ecosystems, particularly in estuarine and marine systems and where monitoring data are not available (e.g., southwestern, central, and western United States). Additional PFOS occurrence data would provide valuable information on potential spatial and temporal variability in surface waters and possible risks posed to aquatic ecosystems.

NA,Environmental Chemical Exposure and Its Effects on Infants' Reproductive Hormones,2018,NA,NA,"In recent years, the birthrate has been continuously declining in Japan. The main causes of the decline are social factors. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that many environmental chemicals show endocrine disrupting properties. Thus, we hypothesized that exposure to these chemicals would also be a causal for the fertility crisis. In this review, we examined current evidence that focused on environmental chemical exposure in utero and its association with reproductive hormones in children. We have included the findings from a prospective birth cohorts, the Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health Sapporo cohort. According to the literature, environmental chemical levels in utero, such as polychlorinated biphenyl, dioxins, perfluorinated chemical substances, phthalates, and bisphenol A were somewhat associated with the levels of reproductive hormones, such as testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, inhibin B, and insulin-like factor-3 in cord blood, in early childhood and adolescence. The literature also suggests the association between exposure to these chemicals and brain-sexual differentiation or the anogenital distance, which suggests the disruption of androgen shower during the developmental stage in the fetal period. There are still knowledge gaps on whether these hormones at an early stage affect the pubertal development and reproductive functions in later life. In addition, alternative chemicals are produced after banning one type. The health effects of alternative chemicals should be evaluated. Effects of exposure to a mixture of the chemicals should also be examined in future studies. In conclusion, the prevention of environmental chemical hazards in relation to human reproductive function is important. It would be one of the countermeasures to the falling birthrate caused by fertility issues.",NA

Recent developments in chemical analysis have revealed that fluorinated compounds have become ubiquitously spread and are regarded as a potential threats to the environment. Due to the carbon-fluorine bond, which has a very high bond strength, these chemicals are extremely persistent towards degradation and some PFCs have a potential for bioaccumulation in organisms. Of particular concern has been the developmental toxicity of PFOS and PFOA, which has been manifested in rodent studies as high mortality of prenatally exposed newborn rats and mice within 24 h after delivery. The nervous system appears to be one of the most sensitive targets of environmental contaminants. The serious developmental effects of PFCs have lead to the upcoming of studies that have investigatedneurotoxic effects of these substances. In this review the major findings of the neurotoxicity of the main PFCs and their suggested mechanisms of action are presented. The neurotoxic effects are discussed in light of other toxic effects of PFCs to indicate the significance of PFCs as neurotoxicants. The main findings are that PFCs may induce neurobehavioral effects, particularly in developmentally exposed animals. The effects are, however, subtle and inconclusive and are often induced at concentrations where other toxic effects also are expected. Mechanistic studies have shown that PFCs may affect the thyroid system, influence the calcium homeostasis, protein kinase C, synaptic plasticity and cellular differentiation. Compared to other environmental toxicants the human blood levels of PFCs are high and of particular concern is that susceptible groups may be exposed to a cocktail of substances that in combination reach harmful concentrations. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",calcium ion; chemical compound; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; glial fibrillary acidic protein; haloacid; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1beta; perfluoro 1 decanesulfonate; perfluoroalkylated compound; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorododecanoic acid; perfluoroheptane sulfonate; perfluorohexane sulfonate; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorotetradecanoic acid; perfluorotridecanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; protein kinase C alpha; protein kinase C beta; protein kinase C gamma; sulfonic acid derivative; thyrotropin; thyroxine; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; animal behavior; ataxia; binding affinity; bioaccumulation; blood brain barrier; blood level; brain level; calcium homeostasis; cell differentiation; concentration (parameters); concentration loss; environmental exposure; geographic distribution; geographical variation (species); habituation; human; lipid peroxidation; liver level; locomotion; long term potentiation; memory consolidation; nerve cell plasticity; neuromodulation; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; oxidative stress; prenatal exposure; priority journal; review; signal transduction; stress; structure analysis; tissue distribution; toxicokinetics; Alkanes; Animals; Biological Transport; Brain; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Neurons; Neurosecretory Systems; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Risk Assessment; Signal Transduction; Tissue Distribution; Animalia; Mus; Rattus; Rodentia

NA,Environment and women's reproductive health,2011,NA,NA,"Background: There is significant evidence that continuous and prolonged exposure to several endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) is a risk factor for reduced fertility and fecundity in women. There is also evidence that ED exposure has trans-generational effects. In this systematic review, we evaluate the evidence for an association between EDC exposure and women's reproductive health. Methods: Studies were found by searching the PubMed database for articles published up to 2010. Associations between ED exposure and women's reproductive health reported in the PubMed database are summarized and classified as fertility and fecundity, pregnancy outcomes, transgenerational exposure and effects. Results: Epidemiological studies on EDCs are not always consistent, in part due to limitations imposed by practical constraints. In order to make progress in this field, we recommend taking advantage of biomonitoring and biobanks, including the development of appropriate biomarkers, and taking into greater consideration modulating factors such as genetic polymorphisms and dietary habits. Further human studies are warranted with particular focus on impaired fertility/fecundity associated with currently widespread ED (e.g. bisphenol A, phthalates and polybrominated flame retardants). Conclusions: A detailed appraisal of compounds specifically related to adverse reproductive outcomes is very important for prevention and risk-communication strategies. Besides research needs, the current evidence is sufficient to prompt precautionary actions to protect women's reproductive health. © The Author 2011.

Peritoneal oxygenation has significant potential for treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. It could offer an effective treatment for rescue ventilation in critically unwell patients. Further large animal studies are needed with further refinement of currently available techniques. What is the implication of the main finding? We propose the further development of techniques and animal models with an eventual goal of evaluation in humans. Peritoneal oxygenation is a promising alternative to rescue ventilation is cases of extreme hypoxia. The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the difficulties that might occur when attempting to oxygenate patients who have suffered a severe pulmonary insult, including in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Traditional mechanical ventilation (MV) is effective; however, in severe cases of hypoxia, the use of rescue therapy, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), may be required but is also associated with significant complexity and complications. In this review, we describe peritoneal oxygenation; a method of oxygenation that exploits the peritoneum’s gas exchange properties in a fashion that is similar to peritoneal dialysis and has shown considerable promise in animal models. We have conducted a review of the available literature and techniques, including intraperitoneal perfluorocarbons, intraperitoneal jet ventilation, a continuous low-pressure oxygen system (PEROX) and the use of phospholipid-coated oxygen microbubbles (OMBs) through peritoneal microbubble oxygenation (PMO). We conclude that peritoneal oxygenation is a promising technique that warrants further investigation and might be used in clinical settings in the future. © 2022 by the authors.","oxygen; animal; artificial ventilation; human; lung; peritoneum; procedures; therapy; Animals; COVID-19; Humans; Lung; Oxygen; Peritoneum; Respiration, Artificial"

PFCs are molecules made up of carbon chains to which fluorine atoms are bound. Due to the strength of the carbon/fluorine bond, the molecules are chemically very stable and are highly resistant to biological degradation; therefore, they belong to a class of compounds that tend to persist in the environment. These compounds can bioaccumulate and also undergo biomagnification. Within the class of PFC chemicals, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorosulphonic acid are generally considered reference substances. Meanwhile, PFCs can be detected almost ubiquitously, e.g., in water, plants, different kinds of foodstuffs, in animals such as fish, birds, in mammals, as well as in human breast milk and blood. PFCs are proposed as a new class of 'persistent organic pollutants'. Numerous publications allude to the negative effects of PFCs on human health. The following review describes both external and internal exposures to PFCs, the toxicokinetics (uptake, distribution, metabolism, excretion), and the toxicodynamics (acute toxicity, subacute and subchronic toxicities, chronic toxicity including carcinogenesis, genotoxicity and epigenetic effects, reproductive and developmental toxicities, neurotoxicity, effects on the endocrine system, immunotoxicity and potential modes of action, combinational effects, and epidemiological studies on perfluorinated compounds). © 2011 Stahl et al.",Animalia; Aves; Mammalia

Numerous mutations have been described in the FLCN gene, the most frequent occurring within a C8 tract of exon 11. This hypermutability is probably due to a slippage in DNA polymerase during replication, resulting in gains/losses of repeat units, causing cancer predisposition. The main phenotypic manifestations related to this disease are lung cysts, leading to pneumothorax, and a 7-fold increased risk for renal neoplasia, although other neoplastic manifestations have been described in BHD-affected individuals.

Actual highly efficient hybrid does have an average daily milk yield of 250 g or 60 g/kg of live weight during the 4-weeks lactation period. However, compared with cow and sow milk, rabbit's milk is much more concentrated in fat (12.9 g/100 g), protein (12.3 g/100 g) and energy (8.4 MJ/kg) which explains the extremely rapid growth of the young (weight x 6 after 3 weeks). Characteristic of rabbit milk is also the nearly absence of lactose (&lt;2 g/100 g). At peak lactation, protein output per kg metabolic weight (13.4 g/day/kg0.75) exceeds even those of Holstein milk cows. The non-nutritional factors having the largest impact on the milk yield are the number of suckling kits, the parity order (primiparous vs. multiparous) and the gestation overlapping degree (rapid decline after 17-20 days of gestation). However, also through the reduction of feed intake, heat stress has a detrimental impact especially when the night temperature remains above 25°C. Rabbit milk lipids are highly saturated (70.4% SFA) due to the high content of C8:0 - C12:0 (50% of total FA) and further characterised by nearly equal quantities of oleic and linoleic acid and an ω-6/ω-3 ratio around 4.

Although strategies to access alkyl fluorides by C−C bond formation (monofluoroalkylation) are inherently convergent and complexity-generating, they have been studied less than methods based on fluorination.

NA,Early life exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and ADHD: A meta-analysis of nine European population-based studies,2020,NA,NA,"INTRODUCTION: To date, the evidence for an association between perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between early life exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and ADHD in a collaborative study including nine European population-based studies, encompassing 4,826 mother–child pairs. METHODS: Concentrations of PFOS and PFOA were measured in maternal serum/plasma during pregnancy, or in breast milk, with different timing of sample collection in each cohort. We used a validated pharmacokinetic model of pregnancy and lactation to estimate concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in children at birth and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of age. We classified ADHD using recommended cutoff points for each instrument used to derive symptoms scores. We used multiple imputation for missing covariates, logistic regression to model the association between PFAS exposure and ADHD in each study, and combined all adjusted study-specific effect estimates using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 399 children were classified as having ADHD, with a prevalence ranging from 2.3% to 7.3% in the studies. Early life exposure to PFOS or PFOA was not associated with ADHD during childhood [odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 0.96 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.06) to 1.02 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.11)]. Results from stratified models suggest potential differential effects of PFAS related to child sex and maternal education. CONCLUSION: We did not identify an increased prevalence of ADHD in association with early life exposure to PFOS and PFOA. However, stratified analyses suggest that there may be an increased prevalence of ADHD in association with PFAS exposure in girls, in children from nulliparous women, and in children from low-educated mothers, all of which warrant further exploration. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5444. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

This paper descibes an asymmetric synthesis of unnatural amino acid derivatives and their subsequent application to the preparation of unnatural amino acid-containing peptides. The α-imino carboxylic acid derivatives, which are common substrates for the synthesis of unnatural amino acids, could be readily prepared by MnO 2 -mediated oxidation of N-PMP-protected glycine derivatives. This reaction allowed us to synthesize novel derivatives such as α-imino perfluoroalkylesters, imides or thioesters. These compounds are useful for the synthesis of unnatural amino acid derivatives. MnO 2 -mediated oxidation was further applied to the synthesis of peptidyl imine. Moreover, a new methodology for the synthesis of unnatural amino acid-containing peptides was developed using the thus obtained imino peptides. This novel approach should be useful for the divergent synthesis of peptides possessing varieties of unnatural amino acid moieties. © 2018 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",amino acid; amino acid derivative; carboxylic acid; ester; glycine derivative; imide; peptide; amino acid; glycine; imine; manganese derivative; manganese dioxide; oxide; peptide; asymmetric synthesis; biological activity; chemical reaction; oxidation; peptide synthesis; Review; analogs and derivatives; catalysis; chemistry; oxidation reduction reaction; protein motif; synthesis; Amino Acid Motifs; Amino Acids; Catalysis; Esters; Glycine; Imides; Imines; Manganese Compounds; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxides; Peptides

This study provides a critical review on the mechanisms and performance of reductive destruction of PFAS with eaq -. Unique properties of eaq - and its generation in different ARP systems, particularly UV/sulfite and UV/iodide, are overviewed. Different degradation mechanisms of PFAS chemicals, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and others (e.g., short chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs), per- A nd polyfluoro dicarboxylic acids, and fluorotelomer carboxylic acids), are reviewed, discussed, and compared. The degradation pathways of these PFAS chemicals rely heavily upon their head groups. For specific PFAS types, fluoroalkyl chain lengths may also affect their reductive degradation patterns. Degradation and defluorination efficiencies of PFAS are considerably influenced by solution chemistry parameters and operating factors, such as pH, dose of chemical solute (i.e., sulfite or iodide) for eaq - photoproduction, dissolved oxygen, humic acid, nitrate, and temperature. Furthermore, implications of the state-of-the-art knowledge on practical PFAS control actions in water industries are discussed and the priority research needs are identified.

Collagen was the most frequently reported agent and yielded short-term cure and improved rates of 74%-100%. This deteriorated to approximately 57% with longer term follow-up. Teflon has similarly lower longer term than short-term success rates, at 33%-76%. The reported local complications and the potential for particle migration have resulted in its lack of widespread acceptance. Autologous fat has yielded the lowest success rate. Longer term success in a small number of silicone microparticle articles was similar to the other injectables at approximately 60%. Early success with silicone microballoons was 70%. The technique is generally free of major morbidity. The indication for injectables is intrinsic sphincter deficiency but hypermobility is not a contraindication. Long-term durability, cost effectiveness, and some safety issues still have to be addressed by further clinical trials.","biomaterial; collagen; collagen gel; drug derivative; GAX-collagen; politef; silastic; adipose tissue; female; human; injection; methodology; patient selection; prostheses and orthoses; review; stress incontinence; transplantation; Adipose Tissue; Biocompatible Materials; Collagen; Female; Humans; Injections; Patient Selection; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Prostheses and Implants; Silicone Elastomers; Urinary Incontinence, Stress"

NA,"Systematic Review, An Illustration of Increased Transparency in a Framework for Evaluating Immunotoxicity Associated with PFOA and PFOS Exposure",2015,NA,NA,"Background: Systematic review methodologies were first developed to assess the efficacy of health care interventions, but these approaches can be adapted to evaluations of environmental health questions such as immunotoxicity associated with PFOA and PFOS exposure. This structured approach provides objectivity and transparency to the process of collecting, synthesizing, and reaching conclusions based on the scientific evidence available. Objectives: To outline the process of systematic review and evidence integration and demonstrate each step by following a single research question from start to finish. The example systematic review will evaluate the evidence that PFOA and PFOS exposure are associated with immunotoxicity – using a subset of the available evidence to illustrate concepts, not to develop hazard identification conclusions. Methods: The Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Approach to evaluating the scientific evidence for immunotoxicity of PFOA and PFOS is detailed in a protocol that is laid out in seven steps: scoping and problem formulation, search for and select studies for inclusion, extract data from studies, assess quality of individual studies, rate confidence in the body of evidence, translate confidence ratings into level of evidence, and integrate evidence to develop hazard identification conclusions incorporating human, animal, and mechanistic evidence. Results and Discussion: Eligibility criteria for identifying important exposures and outcomes were presented as the basis for assembling the relevant studies for evaluating whether or not PFOA or PFOS exposure is associated with immunotoxicity (human, n = 18; animal, n = 80; and mechanistic/in vitro assays, n = 19). A tool for assessing study quality in terms of risk of bias or internal validity was tailored to the research question – particularly for evaluating PFC exposure and assessing immunological outcomes. An example of an evidence profile is provided to illustrate the basis for confidence ratings using a hypothetical set of studies of PFOS and functional antibody response. Finally, a discussion is presented on how the hazard identification conclusions would be reached and interpreted by integrating the human, animal, and mechanistic evidence. Conclusion: The OHAT Approach to hazard identification of health effects of PFCs is illustrated with a case study on PFOA/PFOS and immunotoxicity. Communication of the evaluation process is enhanced by using objective, reproducible methods that transparently document scientific judgments and the scientific basis for hazard identification conclusions. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",NA

The aim of catheter use is to optimise administration of medication and minimise complications such as thrombus formation, thrombophlebitis and sepsis. Catheters made from teflon are less flexible, less durable and stimulate more tissue reaction than polyurethane or silicon. However silicon catheters are more expensive and complicated to insert. Generally, for veterinary practice, the biostability and cost of polyurethane catheters make them preferable for short and long-term use. The smallest diameter catheter should be selected to minimise internal vessel wall contact and irritation without compromising medication delivery. The site of insertion varies with individual preference, vessel access and patient compliance. The jugular, cephalic, saphenous, ear, lateral thoracic and subcutaneous abdominal veins are accessible. Hair removal and a thorough aseptic skin preparation should be performed prior to catheter insertion. Daily maintenance is required to detect complications and maximise catheter longevity. Potential complications include thrombus formation, thromboembolism, bacterial colonisation and septicaemia, blood loss and air embolism. Permanent or transient skin dwelling bacteria are commonly isolated if sepsis occurs. The development of novel antiseptic and antibiotic impregnated catheters may reduce the complications associated with catheter infection in the future.","Bacteria (microorganisms); Thrombus; politef; polyurethan; animal; animal disease; central venous catheterization; economics; equipment; indwelling catheter; instrumentation; methodology; review; risk factor; veterinary medicine; Animals; Catheterization, Central Venous; Catheters, Indwelling; Equipment Contamination; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Polyurethanes; Risk Factors; Veterinary Medicine"

The transition metals are introduced to allow new possibilities for activating carbon-fluorine bonds and are gradually becoming an alternative way to synthesize numerous complex organics containing fluorine. In this review, the recent works on the theoretical mechanistic study for transition metals mediated carbon-fluorine bonds activation and cleavage are summarized. Meanwhile, the general modes of carbon-fluorine bonds activation have been concluded systematically, including the oxidative addition of carbon-fluorine bonds to transition metals, transition-metal-activated nucleophilic substitution, S N 2 type activation of carbon(sp 3 )-fluorine bonds and β-fluorine elimination, etc. The theoretical calculation shows that the reaction could be proceed by an oxidation addition mode, when the zero-valent nickel catalyst with strong reducibility is employed. However, if a zero-valent platinum catalyst is used, oxidation addition only occurs at extra activated carbon-fluorine bonds. In the reduction of polyfluorinated aromatic hydrocarbons by hydrogenated metal species, aromatic nucleophilic substitution between hydride and polyfluorinated aromatic hydrocarbons could occur to realize the activation of carbon-fluoride bonds. For carbon(sp 3 )-fluorine bonds, if ""hard"" Lewis base such as lithium or magnesium salt is employed, the carbon(sp 3 )-fluorine bonds can be activated via bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S N 2). In addition, β-fluoride elimination is also frequently proposed in transition metal-catalyzed C-F functionalizations. © 2019 Chinese Chemical Society & SIOC, CAS.",NA

In 2016, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) established nonregulatory drinking water Health Advisories of 70 ng/L for individual and total concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), the 8-carbon perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) that are the most thoroughly studied PFAS. As of May 2020, 9 US states had concluded that the USEPA Health Advisories are insufficiently protective and developed more stringent PFOA and PFOS guidelines. In addition, 10 states had developed guidelines for other PFAS, primarily PFAAs. This Critical Review discusses the scientific basis for state and USEPA drinking water guidelines for PFOA and PFOS; the same principles apply to guidelines for other PFAS. Similarities and differences among guidelines arise from both toxicity and exposure considerations. The approximately 4-fold range among state guidelines (8–35 ng/L for PFOA, 10–40 ng/L for PFOS) is not large or unexpected for guidelines developed by different scientists at different time points, especially when compared with older USEPA and state guidelines that were generally several orders of magnitude higher. Additional state guidelines for PFOA, PFOS, and other PFAS are expected to become available.

Previous studies mainly focused on the dose-response relationship and cytotoxic effects of pollutants to organisms，while little research focused on pollutant-protein interactions at molecular level. However, the binding of organic pollutants to biomolecules, especially proteins like transporters, membrane receptor and nuclear receptors, is often the first step of toxic effects. It can make a series of endocrine disrupting and genotoxic effects through cell signaling pathway by binding specific target proteins including serum albumin, thyroid transporter, estrogen receptor, androgen receptor, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Thus, the research of interactions between organic pollutants and proteins is helpful and necessary to understand the distribution, metabolism and toxicity mechanism of compounds in organisms at the molecular level. This paper reviewed the latest research progress of the interaction types of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), emerging pollutants and some other pollutants with targeted proteins.

India is the largest user of groundwater where the presence of micropollutants in the subsurface environment has been the focus of many researchers. The objective of this study was to provide a detailed review of studies on micropollutants in Indian groundwater and to provide strategies for further work. It is found that the presence of pharmaceuticals, endocrine disrupting compounds, surfactants, phthalates, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, personal care products, artificial sweeteners, and pesticides in groundwater from different parts of India is reported. Pesticides and phthalate concentrations reported exceed the standard guideline values. This review points out the regions where the groundwater is prone to contamination due to micropollutants. An assessment of temporal variation in the concentration of micropollutants in groundwater has been done only by a few researchers. This study highlighted the need for more research on the possible presence of micropollutants in groundwater, especially in the major polluted rivers in cities where more pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and plastic industries are located. Practitioner Points: Organic micropollutants were not new contaminants into the environment but the one entered even decades ago which has threatening effect. The number of studies on organic micropollutants in groundwater is lesser than surface water or wastewater. Scarcity on the studies of micropollutants was a result of definite technical lack in its analysis and complexity in sample preparation.

In the attempt to replace this function, two lines of investigation were followed. Gas transport using of hemoglobin involves saturable physicochemical mechanisms. The affinity of human ""stroma-free"" hemoglobin for oxygen is too high, hampering the release of oxygen in tissue. The binding of oxygen to stroma-free hemoglobin can be improved by coupling of hemoglobin to pyridoxal phosphate. By cross-linking with, for example, dialdehydes (particularly glutaraldehyde) the production of hemoglobin molecules of higher molecular weight and greater stability is possible. However, first trials in humans using these preparations fall short of expectations. The stability of the polymers and of the preparations was not as good as expected. Another possibility is the use of water-insoluble fluorocarbons (perfluorocarbons), which have a high capacity for physical gas transport. The disadvantage of using emulsions of these substances is the necessity for high partial oxygen pressure to attain sufficient gas transport. The complete insolubility in water impedes the use of the metabolic inert fluorocarbons, because they can only be eliminated via the lungs. Despite these problems the fluorocarbons have been extensively used in humans. In the USA the use of some emulsions is allowed for special indications. Extended clinical use of fluorocarbons and of hemoglobin derivates cannot be expected in the near future. Substitution of the blood hydrocolloid albumin has been practiced for many years, synthetic hydrocolloids being used to replace the colloid osmotic pressure of albumin and also to decrease the blood viscosity by hemodilution and hence improve flow. In Germany hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is the most-used hydrocolloid with the least side effects. Anaphylactic reactions restrict the use of dextran, and gelatin derivatives, because of their short half-life, are not of clinical importance in Germany. Hydrocolloids with a half-life of 3-6 h (dextran 40, middle-substituted HES) are preferred, while those with a half-life of about 20-30 h (dextran 60/70, highly substituted HES) are infrequently used.","blood substitute; oxygen; bleeding; blood; electrolyte balance; erythrocyte; hemodilution; hemoglobin determination; human; methodology; pathophysiology; physiology; review; Blood Loss, Surgical; Blood Substitutes; Erythrocytes; Hemodilution; Hemoglobinometry; Humans; Oxygen; Water-Electrolyte Balance"

Also, we describe present and provisional legislative measures in the European Union framework strategy to regulate PFAS manufacture, import and use as well as some of the most promising treatment technologies designed to remediate PFAS contamination in different environmental compartments. © 2022 by the authors.

To guarantee the reliability and comparability of analytical data an intricate system of quality-assurance measures has to be put into effect in a laboratory. Reference materials and, in particular, certified reference materials (CRMs) are essential for achieving traceability and comparability of measurement results between laboratories and over time. As in any other domain of analytical chemistry, techniques used to monitor the levels and fate of contaminants in the environment must be calibrated using appropriate calibration materials, and the methods must be properly validated using fit-for-purpose matrix-matched CRMs, to ensure confidence in the data produced. A sufficiently large number of matrix CRMs are available for analysis of most elements, and the group of chemicals known as persistent organic pollutants, in environmental compartments and biota. The wide variety of analyte/level/matrix/matrix property combinations available from several suppliers enables analysts to select CRMs which sufficiently match the properties of the samples they analyse routinely. Materials value-assigned for the so-called emerging pollutants are scarce at the moment, though an objective of current development programmes of CRM suppliers is to overcome this problem.",Environmental engineering; Impurities; Organic pollutants; Quality assurance; Quality control; Uncertainty analysis; Certified reference materials; Environmental chemistry; Traceability; Trace analysis; inorganic compound; organic compound; pollutant; review; standard; Environmental Pollutants; Inorganic Chemicals; Organic Chemicals; Reference Standards

As these polymers are not easily degraded in our body, it is difficult to use them in applications that require antithrombotic properties, such as artificial blood vessels. The material used for medical applications should not only be stable in vivo, but it should also be inert to biomolecules such as proteins or cells. In this review, this property is defined as “bio-inert,” and previous studies in this field are summarized. Bio-inert materials are less recognized as foreign substances by proteins or cells in the living body, and they must be covered at interfaces designed with the concept of intermediate water (IW). On the basis of this concept, we present here the current understanding of bio-inertness and unusual blood compatibility found in fluoropolymers used in biomedical applications. IW is the water that interacts with materials with moderate strength and has been quantified by a variety of analytical methods and simulations. For example, by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, IW was defined as water frozen at around -40°C. To consider the role of the IW, quantification methods of the hydration state of polymers are also summarized. These investigations have been conducted independently because of the conflict between hydrophobic fluorine and bio-inert properties that require hydrophilicity. In recent years, not many materials have been developed that incorporate the good points of both aspects, and their properties have seldom been linked to the hydration state. This has been critically performed now. Furthermore, fluorine-containing polymers in medical use are reviewed. Finally, this review also describes the molecular design of the recently reported fluorine-containing bio-inert polymers for controlling their hydration state. Statement of significance: A material covered with a hydration layer known as intermediate water that interacts moderately with other objects is difficult to be recognized as a foreign substance and exhibits bio-inert properties. Fluoropolymers show high durability, but conflict with bio-inert characteristics requiring hydrophilicity as these research studies have been conducted independently. On the other hand, materials that combine the advantages of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic features have been developed recently. Here, we summarize the molecular architecture and analysis methods that control intermediate water and provide a guideline for designing novel fluorine-containing bio-inert materials. © 2021","Blood; Blood vessels; Differential scanning calorimetry; Fluorine; Fluorine containing polymers; Functional polymers; Heat resistance; Hydration; Hydrophilicity; Hydrophobicity; Proteins; Bio-inert property; Foreign substances; Hydration state; Inert materials; Inert polymers; Inert properties; Intermediate waters; Poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate); Property; Medical applications; acrylamide; amino acid; biomaterial; bovine serum albumin; collagen; ethylene; fibrinogen; fluorine; glass; hexafluoropropylene; hydrogel; nylon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyacrylonitrile; polyethylene; polyethylene terephthalate; polymer; polypropylene; polystyrene; polytetrafluoroethylene; polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinylidene fluoride; tetrafluoroethylene; unclassified drug; water; fluorine; analytic method; animal experiment; animal model; antithrombotic activity; apoptosis; Bacillus subtilis; bacterium adherence; biocompatibility; blood compatibility; complement activation; contact angle; crystal structure; crystallization; differential scanning calorimetry; elemental analysis; enthalpy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; gamma radiation; human; hydration; hydrogen bond; hydrophilicity; mesentery lymph node; molecular dynamics; molecular weight; nonhuman; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; quantitative analysis; rat; refraction index; Review; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; Streptococcus mutans; surface property; temperature; water immersion; X ray diffraction; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; zeta potential; differential scanning calorimetry; Biocompatible Materials; Calorimetry, Differential Scanning; Fluorine; Polymers; Water"

Existing regulatory systems have proven to be inadequate for assessing and managing the tens of thousands of chemicals in commerce. A different approach is urgently needed to minimize ongoing production, use, and exposures to hazardous chemicals. The premise of the essential-use approach is that chemicals of concern should be used only in cases in which their function in specific products is necessary for health, safety, or the functioning of society and when feasible alternatives are unavailable. To optimize the essential-use approach for broader implementation in the United States and Canada, we recommend that governments and businesses (1) identify chemicals of concern for essentiality assessments based on a broad range of hazard traits, going beyond toxicity; (2) expedite decision-making by avoiding unnecessary assessments and strategically asking up to three questions to determine whether the use of the chemical in the product is essential; (3) apply the essential-use approach as early as possible in the process of developing and assessing chemicals; and (4) engage diverse experts in identifying chemical uses and functions, assessing alternatives, and making essentiality determinations and share such information broadly. If optimized and expanded into regulatory systems in the United States and Canada, other policymaking bodies, and businesses, the essential-use approach can improve chemicals management and shift the market toward safer chemistries that benefit human and ecological health. © 2023 The Authors.

The primary function of a membrane in VRFBs is to control proton transport between the half-cells and to hinder admixing the anolyte and catholyte at the same time. However, to develop a low-cost and energy-efficient VRFB, other membrane roles are crucial. The combination of a highly stable backbone of polytetrafluoroethylene with hydrophilic perfluorinated-vinyl-polyether side chains equipped with sulfonic acid groups (Nafion membranes) has led to a breakthrough in the field. However, suffering from high cost and low selectivity, these perflurinated membranes are not properly qualified for VRFBs. Sulfonation of aromatic hydrocarbon polymers is suggested as cost-effective alternative chemistry for VRFBs’ membrane design. Further tunning the performance of the membrane and VRFB is obtained through designing their microstructure by different tools, especially adjusting the degree of sulfonation and degree of branching, utilizing additional membrane layers, and incorporation of particles in the polymer matrix. In this review, the studies performed to develop membranes for VRFBs are discussed as a road map for the development of advanced membranes qualified for VRFBs. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH",Aromatic hydrocarbons; Aromatic polymers; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Flow batteries; Sulfonation; Vanadium; Degree of branching; Degree of sulfonation; Energy efficient; Membrane designs; Primary functions; Proton transport; Sulfonic acid groups; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Ion selective membranes

The project aims to provide urban planners with information on the remediation of vacant lands using urban runoff pollutant removal techniques. To find the most effective removal method, relevant scholarly papers and case studies are reviewed to see what types of vacant land have many urban runoff pollutants and how to effectively remove contaminants from stormwater runoff in the city by SCMs. The results show that previously developed/used land (but now vacant) has been identified as contaminated sites, including prior residential, commercial, industrial, and parking lot land use from urban areas. SCMs are effective management approaches to reduce nonpoint source pollution problems runoff. It is an umbrella concept that can be used to capture nature-based, cost-effective, and eco-friendly treatment technologies and redevelopment strategies that are socially inclusive, economically viable, and with good public acceptance. Among these removal techniques, a bioretention system tends to be effective for removing dissolved and particulate components of heavy metals and phosphorus. Using different plant species and increasing filter media depth has identified the effectiveness of eliminating nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N). A medium with a high hydraulic conductivity covers an existing medium with low hydraulic conductivity, and the result will be a higher and more effective decrease for phosphorus (P) pollutants. In addition, wet ponds were found to be highly effective at removing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, with removal rates as high as 99%. For the removal of perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) pollutants, despite the implementation of SCMs in urban areas to remove PFAAs and particulate-related contaminants in stormwater runoff, the current literature has little information on SCMs’ removal of PFAAs. Studies have also found that VUL’s size, shape, and connectivity are significantly inversely correlated with the reduction in stormwater runoff. This paper will help planners and landscape designers make efficient decisions around removing pollutants from VUL stormwater runoff, leading to better use of these spaces. © 2022 by the authors.",hydraulic conductivity; literature review; nonpoint source pollution; pollutant removal; redevelopment; runoff; stormwater; urban development

Furthermore, PFCs possess antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) is a combination of PFCs instilled into the lung to an amount approximating the functional residual capacity (FRC) and a gastidal volume whereas total liquid ventilation (TLV) combines a liquid FRC with a liquid tidal volume. Both systems proved successful in promoting pulmonary function and it was shown in animal models of ALI and ARDS that the TLV effect is even superior to the PLV effect.

Here, we review the toxic effects of PFASs encountered by various plants from physiological, biochemical and molecular perspectives. The exposure routes and bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites are also summarized. The bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites varied between ng/g and μg/g levels. The 50% inhibition concentration of PFASs for plant growth is often several orders of magnitude higher than the environmentally relevant concentrations (ERCs). ERCs of PFASs rarely lead to obvious phenotypic/physiological damages in plants, but markedly perturb some biological activities at biochemical and molecular scales. PFAS exposure induces the over-generated reactive oxygen species and further damages plant cell structure and organelle functions. A number of biochemical activities in plant cells are perturbed, such as photosynthesis, gene expression, protein synthesis, carbon and nitrogen metabolisms. To restore the desire states of cells exposed to PFASs, plants initiate several detoxifying mechanisms, including enzymatic antioxidants, non-enzymatic antioxidants, metallothionein genes and metabolic reprogramming.

They can be found in drinking water, rivers, groundwater, wastewater, household dust, and soils. In this review, the current challenge and status of bioremediation of PFAs in soils was examined. While several technologies to remove PFAS from soil have been developed, including adsorption, filtration, thermal treatment, chemical oxidation/reduction and soil washing, these methods are expensive, impractical for in situ treatment, use high pressures and temperatures, with most resulting in toxic waste. Biodegradation has the potential to form the basis of a cost-effective, large scale in situ remediation strategy for PFAS removal from soils. Both fungal and bacterial strains have been isolated that are capable of degrading PFAS; however, to date, information regarding the mechanisms of degradation of PFAS is limited. Through the application of new technologies in microbial ecology, such as stable isotope probing, metagenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics there is the potential to examine and identify the biodegradation of PFAS, a process which will underpin the development of any robust PFAS bioremediation technology. © Copyright © 2021 Shahsavari, Rouch, Khudur, Thomas, Aburto-Medina and Ball.",Biodegradation; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Cost effectiveness; Groundwater; Mammals; Potable water; Soil pollution; Toxic materials; Waste treatment; Adverse health effects; Biological treatment; Bioremediation technologies; Contaminated soils; In-situ remediation; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Stable-isotope probing; Synthetic organic compounds; Soils

MCTs are widely used for parenteral nutrition in individuals requiring supplemental nutrition and are being more widely used in foods, drugs and cosmetics. MCTs are essentially non-toxic in acute toxicity tests conducted in several species of animals. In ocular and dermal irritation testing MCTs exhibit virtually no potential as ocular or dermal irritants, even with prolonged eye or skin exposure. MCTs exhibit no capacity for induction of hypersensitivity. Ninety-day toxicity tests did not result in notable toxicity, whether the product was administered in the diet up to 9375 mg/kg body weight/day or by intramuscular (im) injection (up to 0.5 ml/kg/day, rabbits). There was no evidence that intravenous (iv) or dietary administration of MCTs adversely affected the reproductive performance of rats or resulted in maternal toxicity, foetal toxicity or teratogenic effects at doses up to 4.28 g/kg body weight/day (iv) or 12,500 mg/kg body weight/day (dietary). There was no evidence that dietary administration of MCTs adversely affected the reproductive performance of pigs or resulted in maternal toxicity, foetal toxicity or teratogenic effects at doses up to 4000 mg/kg body weight/day in the diet. In rabbits, following iv administration, the maternal and foetal no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) were between 1.0 and 4.28 g/kg body weight/day. A 2-year study in rats, conducted with a closely related compound (tricaprylin, a triglyceride with C8 fatty acids), provided no evidence of a carcinogenic effect when the material was administered by oral gavage at levels up to 10 ml/kg (9.54 g/kg) per day. Although tricaprylin was found to be positive in one of five strains of Salmonella typhimurium in the presence of metabolic activation in an Ames mutagenicity assay, the results of the carcinogenicity test with tricaprylin and mutagenicity tests with caprylic acid indicate that MCTs do not have the potential to be carcinogenic or mutagenic.

Meanwhile, new media (i.e. biochar, bioaugmented carriers with selected strain/mixed cultures) do not only eliminate conventional pollutants (i.e. high concentration of nitrogen, etc.), but also effectively remove emerging pollutants (i.e. micropollutants, nonylphenol, adsorbable organic halogens, etc.) by forming thick and dense biofilm, creating anoxic/anaerobic microenvironments inside the media, enriching special functional microorganisms and increasing activity of microorganisms. Additionally, media can improve sludge characteristics (i.e. less extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products, larger floc size, better sludge settleability, etc.), alleviating membrane fouling. Future studies need to focus on the development and applications of more new functional media in removing wider spectrum of emerging pollutants and enhancing biogas generation, as well as scale-up of lab-scale AGMBRs to pilot or full-scale AGMBRs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Bioconversion; Bioreactors; Membrane fouling; Membranes; Microorganisms; Pollution; Reclamation; Anaerobics; Attached growth; Carrier; Emerging pollutants; Growth process; Medium; Membrane bioreactor system; Microenvironments; Nutrient pollutants; Property; Wastewater treatment; activated carbon; biogas; polymer; bioreactor; fouling; persistent organic pollutant; pollutant removal; wastewater treatment; aerobic bacterium; anaerobic bacterium; biofouling; biomass; concentration (parameter); nonhuman; particle size; physical chemistry; physical parameters; quorum quenching; Review; waste component removal; waste water management; artificial membrane; bioreactor; sewage; wastewater; water management; Bioreactors; Membranes, Artificial; Sewage; Waste Water; Water Purification"

Materials and Methods: This retrospective case series consisted of eight consecutive patients (four female, four male) who presented with retinal detachment (traumatic, secondary to inferior retinal tear, presence of proliferative vitreoretinopathy) at a tertiary university medical center in 2018-2019. All patients underwent pars plana vitrectomy with short-term PFD tamponade. Patients with a minimum follow-up of 3 months were included in the study. The medical charts were analyzed for patient demographics, retinal attachment rates, pre- and postoperative visual acuity, and postoperative complications. Results: The mean duration of PFD tamponade was 16.5 ± 6.3 (range, 7-27) days. The mean follow-up time for the patients was 8.63 ± 2.5 months. The retina was reattached intraoperatively in all patients. In seven patients (87.5%), the retina was still attached throughout follow-up without further vitrectomies. A statistically signifi cant increase was observed when preoperative mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was compared with mean BCVA in the last follow-up visit (2.9 ± 0.3, 1.3 ± 0.7 logMAR respectively, p=0.018). In seven (87.5%) patients, BCVA improved postoperatively compared with preoperatively. In the postoperative period, pupillary membrane formation was observed in two (25.0%) patients, retrolental membrane in one (12.5%) patient, and epiretinal membrane in one (12.5%) patient. Conclusion: PFD seems to be safe to use as a short-term postoperative vitreoretinal tamponade, and it is useful in retinal detachment. © 2021 Gazi Eye Foundation.

Many studies around the world have reported the presence about these compounds in different aquatic ecosystems, raising concerns about the potential negative effects that occur on water, human health, and wildlife. In this context, this article aims to present a review on a global level of the most relevant aspects for the presence of PPs in water, since 2010 to 2019. The increased number of studies report the presence at emerging contaminants including PPs of different types in surface water, groundwater, wastewater and drinking water. The main sources of PPs entry into aquatic systems are due to discharges of wastewater that collect domestic water, hospital effluents and effluents from untreated or inadequately treated factories before being released into rivers and seas. The presence of PPs in the aquatic environment concerns about their persistence, bioaccumulation, toxicity and the generation of antibiotic resistance from many microorganisms, among other consequences not yet studied in the environment. © the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.

PEM is the main component in the fuel cell system for the proton transport process, which affects the overall operating performance. Studies on hydrocarbon membranes have come to the spotlight due to the high cost of PFSAs, which possess outstanding electrochemical characteristics. A major approach for defining high-performing hydrocarbon membranes is by understanding the structural and functional requisites of PEM. The optimal polymer structures in PEM that meet these requirements can be found by experimental results depending on various parameters such as chain length, functional group, etc. Various strategies for improving the pristine membrane performance will be illustrated by comparing with PFSAs modification methods in this review. In addition, possible further research to overcome low chemical stability, which is the greatest weakness, will be suggested. © 2020",Cell engineering; Chain length; Chemical stability; Hydrocarbons; Membranes; Polyelectrolytes; Structural optimization; Electrochemical characteristics; Hydrocarbon membrane; Modification methods; Molecular engineering; Operating performance; Perfluorinated sulfonic acid membranes; Polymer electrolyte membranes; Proton transport process; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)

Type C isolates must produce at least beta toxin (CPB) and alpha toxin (CPA) and most strains produce several other toxins including perfringolysin O (PFO) and TpeL. However, current evidence indicates that CPB is the main virulence factor for type C infections. Most of this evidence is based upon the loss of virulence shown by isogenic type C CPB knock out mutants on cells, and also in rabbit intestinal loops and in mouse models. This virulence is regained when these mutants are complemented with the wild-type cpb gene. Many type C isolates respond to close contact with enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells by producing all toxins, except TpeL, much more rapidly than occurs during in vitro growth. This in vivo effect involves rapid transcriptional upregulation of the cpb, cpb2, pfoA and plc toxin genes. Rapid Caco-2 cell-induced upregulation of CPB and PFO production involves the VirS/VirR two-component system, since upregulated in vivo transcription of the pfoA and cpb genes was blocked by inactivating the virR gene and was reversible by complementation to restore VirR expression. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..",clostridium perfringens toxin; Clostridium toxin; TpeL toxin; unclassified drug; amino acid sequence; bacterial virulence; cell strain CACO 2; Clostridium perfringens; Clostridium perfringens infection; human; in vitro study; necrotizing enteritis; nonhuman; pathogenesis; review; thermostability; upregulation; wild type; Animals; Bacterial Toxins; Clostridium Infections; Clostridium perfringens; Gastroenteritis; Humans; Mice; Rabbits; Virulence; Virulence Factors; Animalia; Clostridium perfringens; Oryctolagus cuniculus

While there is considerable evidence of implementation initiatives in direct care context, there is limited investigation of implementation initiatives in decision-making context as it relates to program planning, service delivery and developing policies. Research has also shown a gap in consistent application of system-level strategies that can effectively translate organizational policies around patient and family engagement into practice. Methods: The broad objective of this initiative was to develop a system-level implementation strategy to include patient and family advisors (PFAs) at decision-making points in primary healthcare (PHC) based on well-established evidence and literature. In this opportunity sponsored by the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement (CFHI) a co-design methodology, also well-established was applied in identifying and developing a suitable implementation strategy to engage PFAs as members of quality teams in PHC. Diabetes management centres (DMCs) was selected as the pilot site to develop the strategy. Key steps in the process included review of evidence, review of the current state in PHC through engagement of key stakeholders and a co-design approach. Results: The project team included a diverse representation of members from the PHC system including patient advisors, DMC team members, system leads, providers, Public Engagement team members and CFHI improvement coaches. Key outcomes of this 18-month long initiative included development of a working definition of patient and family engagement, development of a Patient and Family Engagement Resource Guide and evaluation of the resource guide. Conclusion: This novel initiative provided us an opportunity to develop a supportive system-wide implementation plan and a strategy to include PFAs in decision-making processes in PHC. The well-established co-design methodology further allowed us to include value-based (customer driven quality and experience of care) perspectives of several important stakeholders including patient advisors. The next step will be to implement the strategy within DMCs, spread the strategy PHC, both locally and provincially with a focus on sustainability. © 2017 The Author(s); Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.",Canada; decision making; diabetes mellitus; family; human; information processing; organization and management; patient participation; patient satisfaction; primary health care; procedures; professional-patient relationship; Canada; Decision Making; Diabetes Mellitus; Family; Focus Groups; Humans; Patient Participation; Patient Satisfaction; Primary Health Care; Professional-Patient Relations

More recently, many of the molecular mechanisms underlying the multiple effects of TH on proliferation, differentiation, migration, synaptogenesis and myelination in the developing nervous system have been elucidated. At the same time data from both epidemiological studies and animal models have revealed that the influence of thyroid signaling on development of the nervous system, extends to all periods of life, from early embryogenesis to neurogenesis in the adult brain. This review focuses on recent insights into the actions of TH during early neurogenesis. A key concept is that, in contrast to the previous ideas that only the unliganded receptor was implicated in these early phases, a critical role of the ligand, T3, is increasingly recognized. These findings are considered in the light of increasing knowledge of cell specific control of T3 availability as a function of deiodinase activity and transporter expression. These requirements for TH in the early stages of neurogenesis take on new relevance given the increasing epidemiological data on adverse effects of TH lack in early pregnancy on children's neurodevelopmental outcome. These ideas lead logically into a discussion on how the actions of TH during the first phases of neurogenesis can be potentially disrupted by gestational iodine lack and/or chemical pollution.

Emerging pollutants (EPs) are ubiquitous anthropogenic compounds of environmental concern that can be found at different concentration levels in matrices such as sediment, water and aquatic biota. In addition, EPs can be bioaccumulated and biomagnified, inducing adverse effects on biota, and posing a risk to humans when contaminated biota is consumed. Unlike abiotic matrices, the occurrence of EPs in aquatic biota has not been widely studied. This is probably because their complexity, due to the presence of lipids, proteins and other organic compounds, makes the extraction and analysis of EPs difficult.

Thermal treatment is the most common remediation approach for PFAS-contaminated solid wastes. Although various thermal treatment techniques have demonstrated the potential to destruct PFAS, the fate of PFAS, removal efficacy, potential emissions, and the formation of incomplete combustion products during thermal treatment are little known. This study provides a critical review on the behavior of PFAS based on different types of thermal treatment technologies with various PFAS-impacted environmental medias that include water, soil, sewage sludge, pure PFAS materials, and other PFAS-containing wastes. Different extents of PFAS thermal destruction are observed across various thermal treatment techniques and operating conditions. PFAS removal and destruction efficiencies rely heavily on PFAS structures, the complex combustion chemistry, the presence or absence of oxygen, temperature, and other operational conditions. This review also covers proposed PFAS thermal destruction mechanisms. Different thermal destruction mechanisms for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and other PFAS are reviewed and compared. The majority of studies about PFAS thermal destruction mechanisms were focused on a specific list of PFAS and based mostly on the pyrolysis treatment. The basic pathway for PFAS destruction during pyrolysis is hydrodefluorination, which could be largely influenced by the alkaline condition. Future field-scale research that involves the characterization of PFAS destruction products and incomplete combustion products is needed to address public concerns and better emission control.

Once discharged from industrial, domestic and urban sources into the urban wastewater collection system they may transfer to the residual solids during wastewater treatment and assessment of their significance and implications for beneficial recycling of the treated sewage sludge biosolids is required. Research on organic contaminants (OCs) in biosolids has been undertaken for over thirty years and the increasing body of evidence demonstrates that the majority of compounds studied do not place human health at risk when biosolids are recycled to farmland. However, there are 143,000 chemicals registered in the European Union for industrial use and all could be potentially found in biosolids. Therefore, a literature review of 'emerging' OCs in biosolids has been conducted for a selection of chemicals of potential concern for land application based upon human toxicity, evidence of adverse effects on the environment and endocrine disruption. To identify monitoring and research priorities the selected chemicals were ranked using an assessment matrix approach. Compounds were evaluated based upon environmental persistence, human toxicity, evidence of bioaccumulation in humans and the environment, evidence of ecotoxicity and the number and quality of studies focussed on the contaminant internationally. The identified chemicals of concern were ranked in decreasing order of priority: perfluorinated chemicals (PFOS, PFOA); polychlorinated alkanes (PCAs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs); organotins (OTs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC); benzothiazoles; antibiotics and pharmaceuticals; synthetic musks; bisphenol A, quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), steroids; phthalate acid esters (PAEs) and polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMSs).A number of issues were identified and recommendations for the prioritisation of further research and monitoring of 'emerging' OCs for the agricultural use of biosolids are provided. In particular, a number of 'emerging' OCs (PFOS, PFOA and PCAs) were identified for priority attention that are environmentally persistent and potentially toxic with unique chemical properties, or are present in large concentrations in sludge, that make it theoretically possible for them to enter human and ecological food-chains from biosolids-amended soil. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Ammonium compounds; Antibiotics; Biochemistry; Biological materials; Biosolids; Chemicals; Drug products; Ecology; Esters; Ethers; Health risks; Hormones; Impurities; Industrial chemicals; Industrial water treatment; Land use; Lipids; Naphthalene; Organic compounds; Organic pollutants; Paraffins; Phenols; Polydimethylsiloxane; Recycling; Sewage sludge; Silicones; Steroid hormones; Toxicity; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water analysis; Acid ester; Benzothiazoles; Bis-phenol a; Land applications; Organotins; Perfluorochemicals; Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Polychlorinated alkanes; Polychlorinated naphthalenes; Quaternary ammonium compound; Steroids; Synthetics musks; Triclocarban; Triclosan; Organic chemicals; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; antibiotic agent; benzothiazole; dimeticone; musk; organic compound; organotin compound; perfluoro compound; phthalic acid ester; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated alkane; polychlorinated naphthalene; quaternary ammonium derivative; steroid; triclocarban; triclosan; unclassified drug; ammonium compound; antibiotics; assessment method; bioaccumulation; biosolid; drug; European Union; health risk; hormone; organic pollutant; PBDE; phthalate; public health; sewage; sludge; steroid; toxicity; waste treatment; wastewater; agricultural procedures; bioaccumulation; biosolid; chemical analysis; concentration (parameters); ecotoxicity; environmental monitoring; food chain; land use; physical chemistry; pollutant; priority journal; recycling; review; risk assessment; sludge; soil amendment; soil fertilization; Europe"

This has led to efforts to better understand the hazards that may be inherent in these compounds, as well as the global distribution of the PFAAs. Much attention has focused on understanding the toxicology of the two most widely known PFAAs, perfluorooctanoic acid, and perfluorooctane sulfate. More recently, research was extended to other PFAAs. There has been substantial progress in understanding additional aspects of the toxicology of these compounds, particularly related to the developmental toxicity, immunotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and the potential modes of action. This review provides an overview of the recent advances in the toxicology and mode of action for PFAAs, and of the monitoring data now available for the environment, wildlife, and humans.

The term ‘pollen–food allergy syndrome’ (PFAS) defines a series of clinical symptoms in pollen-sensitised patients after the ingestion of plant-derived food. The symptoms of PFAS range from localised oral symptoms to severe systemic reactions. The exact prevalence of PFAS is uncertain for various reasons, including a wide geographical distribution and the lack of standardised population-based studies. Three highly conserved protein classes responsible for most PFAS cases are the profilin, the pathogenesis-related protein group 10 (PR-10) and non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs). It has been postulated that climate change, pollution and agricultural practices may increase the expression of these and other defence proteins in plants, causing an increase in allergen load exposure. With advances in component-resolved diagnostic testing, the role of these other allergens can now be revealed. The diagnosis of PFAS is multifaceted and includes a comprehensive clinical history focusing on inhalant allergy and potential cross-reactivities combined with different in vitro and in vivo tests. A better understanding of the cross-reacting allergens and their characteristics may create an awareness of this allergy syndrome essential to managing such patients correctly. © 2022, Allergy Society of South Africa.

They are highly persistent, bioaccumulative, and cause adverse effects in humans and wildlife. Because of the widespread use of these organohalogens in household items and consumer products, indoor contamination may be a significant source of human exposure, especially for children. One significant concern with regard to health effects associated with exposure to organohalogens is endocrine disruption. This review focuses on PCBs and PBDEs as old and new organohalogens, respectively, and their effects on two neuroendocrine systems; thyroid hormones and the arginine vasopressin system (AVP). Regarding neuroendocrine effects of organohalogens, there is considerable information on the thyroid system as a target and evidence is now accumulating that the AVP system and associated functions are also susceptible to disruption. AVP-mediated functions such as osmoregulation, cardiovascular function as well as social behavior, sexual function and learning/memory are discussed. For both thyroid and AVP systems, the timing of exposure seems to play a major role in the outcome of adverse effects. The mechanism of organohalogen action is well understood for the thyroid system. In comparison, this aspect is understudied in the AVP system but some similarities in neural processes, shown to be targeted by these pollutants, serve as promising possibilities for study. One challenge in understanding modes of action within neuroendocrine systems is their complexity stemming, in part, from interdependent levels of organization. Further, because of the interplay between neuroendocrine and neural functions and behavior, further investigation into organohalogen-mediated effects is warranted and may yield insights with wider scope. Indeed, the current literature provides scattered evidence regarding the role of organohalogen-induced neuroendocrine disruption in the neuroplasticity related to both learning functions and brain structure but future studies are needed to establish the role of endocrine disruption in nervous system function and development. © 2010.","2,2',4,4' tetrabromodiphenyl ether; 2,2',4,4' tetrachlorobiphenyl; argipressin; liothyronine; organohalogen derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; polybrominated biphenyl; polychlorinated biphenyl; thyroxine; unclassified drug; behavior disorder; brain function; chemical structure; cognitive defect; environmental exposure; hormonal regulation; human; infertility; learning; memory disorder; nerve cell plasticity; nervous system development; neuroanatomy; neuroendocrine disease; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; priority journal; review; target organ; thyroid function; thyroid hormone metabolism; Animals; Arginine Vasopressin; Central Nervous System; Endocrine Disruptors; Female; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Halogenated; Learning; Male; Mice; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurosecretory Systems; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Rats; Social Behavior; Thyroid Gland; Thyroid Hormones"

This study was designed to explore the association between PFCs and cognitive ability in older adults. Methods: We assessed the association between four PFCs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and self-reported limitation due to difficulty remembering or periods of confusion using data from participants aged 60-85 years from the 1999-2000 and 2003-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. We also considered whether diabetic status or diabetic medication use modifies this association in light of in vitro evidence that PFCs may act on the same receptors as some diabetic medications. Results: In multivariable adjusted models, point estimates suggest a protective association between PFCs and self-reported cognitive limitation (odds ratio, OR; 95% confidence interval, CI) for a doubling in PFC concentration: PFOS (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78, 1.03), PFOA (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.78, 1.09), PFNA (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.79, 1.04) and PFHxS (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.82, 1.06). The protective association was concentrated in diabetics, with strong, significant protective associations in nonmedicated diabetics. Conclusions: This cross-sectional study suggests that there may be a protective association between exposure to PFCs and cognition in older adults, particularly diabetics. Copyright © 2012 S.

The most common approach for treating contaminated water currently relies on removal of PFAS by sorption. The spent sorbents loaded with PFAS can potentially be disposed of at landfills, provided the sorbed contaminants remain sequestered and certain risk criteria are met. Hence, it is essential that remediation sorbents (i) rapidly adsorb a large variety of PFAS under varying water chemistry conditions, and (ii) do not release the adsorbed PFAS in due course. This review aims at establishing the current state of knowledge about the potential release of PFAS that may occur during and after treatment. The scientific literature currently provides data for a very restricted range of long-chain PFAS. Our knowledge of the dynamics of PFAS adsorption processes on engineered sorbents is limited, and even less is known about their desorption processes. The sorption of PFAS can be strongly affected by changes in the solution pH, ionic strength and dissolved organic matter content, and the process is also subject to complex competition mechanisms in the presence of other PFAS as well as organic contaminants and inorganic salts. Several studies suggest that changes in one or several of these factors may trigger the release of PFAS from engineered sorbents. This phenomenon is more likely to occur for PFAS with shorter carbon chain lengths (<C8), at high pH and in the presence of other PFAS or other anionic sorbates. The release of PFAS from spent sorbent materials, stored or deposited under conditions that vary over time, is highly undesirable, as they can potentially become a secondary source of PFAS in the environment. Our analysis identifies a number of knowledge-gaps that should be urgently addressed in order to design sustainable remediation solutions, including an improved management of spent sorbent materials. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Contamination; Ionic strength; Remediation; Sorption; Water pollution; Water treatment; Carbon-chain length; Competition mechanism; Contaminated lands; Contaminated water; Desorption process; Dissolved organic matters; Organic contaminant; Scientific literature; Sorbents; activated carbon; benzoic acid derivative; covalent organic framework; dissolved organic matter; metal organic framework; pentafluorobenzoic acid; perfluorobutane sulfonic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; activated carbon; chemical compound; contaminated land; desorption; dissolved organic matter; ion exchange; landfill; remediation; resin; waste management; water treatment; aquifer; binding site; bioremediation; carbon sequestration; compression; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; ionic strength; kinetic parameters; landfill; leaching; peer review; pH; Review; static electricity

PFAS can be distinguished, among other things, by their different carbon chain lengths and functional groups. The aim of this study was to provide comprehensive evidence on PFAS transfer rates across the human placental barrier by means of a meta-analysis based upon a systematic review. The available literature up to April 2021 was reviewed and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) of PFAS assessed. A total of 39 studies reporting data on 20 PFAS were included in the systematic review. Of these, 20 studies with data on 19 compounds were included in the meta-analysis. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA v3.0) was used for quantitative, statistical analyses with random effects models. A curvilinear relationship was found with short and long chains of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) exhibiting higher TTE than compounds with intermediate chain length. Among the less well studied PFAS, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), 6:2 fluorotelomersulfonic acid (6:2 FTS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) stood out the most with a high TEEs. The dependence of TTEs on chain length and functional group is clearly shown in this first meta-analysis on PFAS transfer across the human placenta. More data on effects of less well studied PFAS in pregnant women and neonates are needed to assess the potential risk for fetal exposure. © 2021 The Author(s).

Overall, our analysis provides one of the first syntheses of available empirical PFAS toxicokinetic data to facilitate interpreting human relevance of animal study findings and developing health-based criteria for PFAS from such studies. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",perfluoro compound; perfluorobutane sulfonate; perfluorobutanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; absorption; biliary clearance; bioaccumulation; chemical structure; excretion; half life time; hazard assessment; health hazard; lactation; mammal; menstruation; metabolism; placenta; priority journal; renal clearance; Review; sex difference; tissue distribution; toxicokinetics; vertical transmission; volume of distribution; chemistry; classification; environmental monitoring; human; pharmacokinetics; pollutant; risk assessment; toxicity; toxicokinetics; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Risk Assessment; Toxicokinetics

Some of the key issues and shortcomings of the PFSA-based PEMFC technology are briefly discussed. These include water management, CO poisoning, hydrogen, reformate and methanol as fuels, cooling, and heat recovery. As a means to solve these shortcomings, high-temperature polymer electrolyte membranes for operation above 100 °C are under active development. This treatise is devoted to a review of the area encompassing modified PFSA membranes, alternative sulfonated polymer and their composite membranes, and acid-base complex membranes. PFSA membranes have been modified by swelling with nonvolatile solvents and preparing composites with hydrophilic oxides and solid proton conductors. DMFC and H2/O 2(air) cells based on modified PFSA membranes have been successfully operated at temperatures up to 120 °C under ambient pressure and up to 150 °C under 3-5 atm. Alternative polymers are selected from silicon- and fluorine-containing inorganic polymers or aromatic hydrocarbon polymers and functionalized by sulfonation. The sulfonated hydrocarbons and their inorganic composites are potentially promising for high-temperature operation. High conductivities have been obtained at temperatures up to 180 °C. Acid-base complex membranes constitute another class of electrolyte membranes. A high-temperature PEMFC based on H3PO4-doped PBI has been demonstrated for operation at temperatures up to 200 °C under ambient pressure. The advanced features include high CO tolerance, simple thermal and water management, and possible integration with the fuel processing unit.",Water management; Carbon monoxide; Electrolytes; Fluorine; Fuel cells; High temperature operations; Hydrogen; Methanol; Silicon; Sulfonation; Waste heat utilization; Polymeric membranes; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; hydrogen; methanol; perfluoro compound; perfluorosulfonic acid; polymer; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; water; catalyst support; conductance; high temperature procedures; kinetics; membrane; polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell; review; technology; temperature

In particular, characterization of the enantiomeric excess of amino acids gives relevant information about the biotic or abiotic origin of molecules, because it is generally assumed that life elsewhere could be based on either l or d amino acids, but not both. The analytical procedures used in in-situ space missions for chiral discrimination of amino acids must meet severe requirements imposed by flight conditions: short analysis time, low energy consumption, robustness, storage for long periods under extreme conditions, high efficiency and sensitivity, automation, and remote-control operation. Such methods are based on gas chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography, and capillary electrophoresis, usually coupled with mass spectrometry; of these, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is the only such combination yet used in space missions. Preliminary in-situ sample derivatization is required before GC-MS analysis to convert amino acids into volatile and thermally stable compounds. The silylation reagent most commonly used, N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide, is unsuitable for detection of homochirality, and alternative derivatization techniques have been developed that preserve the stereochemical configuration of the original compounds and are compatible with spaceflight conditions. These include the reagent N,N-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal, which has already been used in the Rosetta mission, a mixture of alkyl chloroformate, ethanol, and pyridine, a mixture of perfluorinated anhydrides and perfluoro alcohols, and hexafluoroacetone, the first gaseous derivatizing agent. In all the space instruments, solvent extraction of organic matter and chemical derivatization have been combined in a single automatic and remote-controlled procedure in a chemical reactor. Liquid-based separation systems have been used in space missions. In particular, microchip capillary electrophoresis, based on microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems, enables high-performance chemical analysis of amino acids with low mass and volume equipment and low power and reagent consumption. Coupling with laser-induced fluorescence detectors results in ultra-low limits of detection. This critical review describes applications of the on-board instruments used in the Rosetta mission to comets and in the more recent Mars exploration program, i.e., the Mars Science Laboratory and ExoMars missions.

In this method, we utilized a specific affnity between perfluoroalkyl-containing compounds, i.e., ‘fluorous’ compounds (fluorophilicity). Our strategy involves the derivatization of target analytes with perfluoroalkyl reagents, followed by selective retention of the derivatives with a perfluoroalkyl-modified stationary phase LC column. The perfluoroalkylated derivatives are strongly retained on the column owing to their fluorophilicity, whereas non-derivatized species, such as sample matrices, are hardly retained. Therefore, utilizing this derivatization method, target analytes can be determined selectively without interference from matrices. This method has been successfully applied to the LC analysis of some biogenic and related compounds in complex biological samples. © 2015 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.","biological product; fluorine derivative; perfluoroalkyl compound; unclassified drug; biogenic amine; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; affinity chromatography; derivatization; fluorous derivatization; liquid chromatography; Review; bioassay; liquid chromatography; procedures; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Biogenic Amines; Biological Assay; Chromatography, Liquid; Fluorine Compounds"

Big efforts are continuously made to monitor their levels and identify safe thresholds. For this purpose, an essential step is to prioritize harmful substances and understand their effect on human body. Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) deserve particular attention because of their wide diffusion and potential correlation with different diseases including glucose intolerance, hyperlipidaemia, thyroid diseases, gestational diabetes mellitus and hypertension, testicular and genitourinary cancer as well as impaired kidney function. This review focuses on the renal effects of PFCs, with the attempt to clarify their occurrence and pathogenetic mechanisms.Recent findingsWe reviewed MEDLINE and EMBASE citations between 31 October 2017 and 31 May 2019 and selected human studies measuring PFCs exposure, kidney function markers and the ability of haemodialysis to remove PFCs from the circulating blood. It has been currently clarified that exposure to PFCs is linked with an impaired kidney function and that they can be removed by blood purification.SummaryFurther studies are required on the potential synergic negative effect of PFCs co-exposure with other pollutants as well as animal studies about the removal capacity of different haemodialysis membranes.

As for oxygen carriers, there are several candidates such as perfluorochemicals, modified hemoglobins and liposome encapsulated hemoglobins and albuimin heme. Perfluorochemicals have limited oxygen carrying capacity and oxygen inhalation is mandatory when they are used. Modified hemoglobins such as intermolecular or intramolecular cross linked hemoglobins have side effect to cause hypertension by scavenging nitro oxide (NO) which is produced by endothelial cells, because the size of these hemoglobins are small enough to go to the adjacent place near endothelial surface. Hemoglobin vesicles (HbV) in which hemoglobins are encapsulated in liposome is most possible candidate for oxygen carrier. Usefulness and safety of the HbV is evidenced by animal shock model or exchange transfusion model and they are now being prepared for clinical trials as red blood substitutes or oxygen therapeutics.

The advantage of magnetic storage is that the storage density is increasing at a very rapid rate. Recently, with the introduction of thin film media and a magneto-resistive head, the storage densities are increasing at a rate of 100% per year, the storage density in hard disks reached 50 M bit/mm2 for production and 300 M bit/mm2 for demonstration. Diamond-like carbon (DLC) is applied over a Co-based magnetic layer as a smooth protective layer, and one to two monolayers of perfluoropolyether are used as a lubricant. The tribological properties of ultra-thin films have attracted considerable attention, because they can dramatically influence the tribological properties of recording media, which limits the storage density before we achieve the magnetic limit. The rapidly increasing storage density will soon require carbon overcoats of only 2 nm and a lubricant of less than 1 nm to achieve the above-mentioned recording density. Not only the film properties, but also the surface interaction have become a matter of importance in this region. In order to ensure the tribological properties and lifetime of the magnetic recording system, the lubricant molecule must be strongly attached to the carbon surface so that they can avoid spin-off from the rapidly rotating disks, depletion caused by head-media interactions, or simple displacement by adsorbed water or airborne organic compounds. Also, a strongly adsorbed lubricant leads to low friction and improve durability. This paper reviews conventional methods used to characterize these films and the interaction between carbon and the lubricant molecules. The prospect for the analysis of ultra-thin film from the standpoints of XPS, FTIR, Raman, EELS, Auger is also given.",carbon; lubricating agent; perfluoropolyether; polyether derivative; unclassified drug; adsorption; chemical interaction; density; economic aspect; film; magnetism; medical technology; Raman spectrometry; recording; review; rotation; surface property; water absorption; X ray analysis; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy

A number of reviews on the synthesis, electrochemical properties, and fuel cell applications of perfluorinated polymer electrolytes have also appeared during this period. While perfluorinated polymer electrolytes have satisfactory properties for a successful fuel cell electrolyte membrane, the major drawbacks to large-scale commercial use involve cost and low proton-conductivities at high temperatures and low humidities.

Magnetic anomalies bear extremely rich information on Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic evolution. 3D analytical signal amplitudes computed from magnetic anomalies reveal very precisely relict distributions of Mesozoic sedimentary sequences on the two conjugate continental margins, and they are also found very effective in depicting later-stage magmatism and tectonic transitions and zonation within the SCS oceanic crust. Through integrated analyses of magnetic, gravity and reflection seismic data, we define the continent-ocean boundary (COB) around the South China Sea continental margin, and find that the COB coincides very well with a transition zone from mostly positive to negative free-air gravity anomalies. This accurate outlining of the COB is critical for better tracing magnetic anomalies induced by the oceanic crust. The geometrically complex COB and inner magnetic zonation require the introduction of an episodic opening model, as well as a transform fault (here coined as Zhongnan Fault) between the East and Southwest Sub-basins, while within the East and Southwest Sub-basins, magnetic anomalies are rather continuous laterally, indicating nonexistence of large transform faults within these sub-basins. We enhance magnetic anomalies caused by the shallow basaltic layer via a band-pass filter, and recognize that the likely oldest magnetic anomaly near the northern continental margin is C12 according to the magnetic time scale CK95. Near the southern continental margin, magnetic anomalies are less recognizable and the anomaly C12 appears to be missing. These differences show an asymmetrical opening style with respect to the relict spreading center, and the northern part appears to have slightly faster spreading rates than to the south. The magnetic anomalies C8 (M1 and M2, ~26 Ma) represent important magnetic boundaries within the oceanic basin, and are possibly related to changes in spreading rates and magmatic intensities. The magnetic evidence for a previously proposed ridge jump after the anomaly C7 is not clear. The age of the Southwest Sub-basin has yet to be further examined, most favorably with deep-tow magnetic surveys and ocean drilling. Our magnetic spectral study shows that the shallowest Curie points are located around the eastern part of the Southwestern Sub-basin, whereas within the East Sub-basin Curie depths are smaller to the north of the relict spreading center than to the south. This pattern of Curie depths is consistent to regional heat flow measurements and later-stage volcanic seamount distributions, and we therefore reason that Curie-depth variations are closely associated with later-stage magmatism, rather than with crustal ages. Although magnetic anomalies located around the northern continent-ocean transition zone (COT) are relatively quiet, this area is not a typical magnetic quiet zone since conceptually it differs markedly from an oceanic magnetic quiet zone. The relatively quiet magnetic anomalies are seemingly associated with a shallowing in Curie isotherm and thinning in magnetic layer, but our comprehensive observations suggest that the well-preserved thick Mesozoic sedimentary rocks are major causes for the magnetically quiet zone. The high similarities between various low-pass filtered marine and air-borne magnetic anomalies and satellite magnetic anomalies clearly confirm that deeper magnetic sources (in the lower crust and the uppermost mantle) have contributions to long-wavelength surface magnetic anomalies in the area, as already inferred from magnetically inversed Curie depths. The offshore south China magnetic anomaly (SCMA) becomes more prominent on low-pass filtered marine and air-borne magnetic anomalies and satellite magnetic anomalies, indicating very deeply-buried magnetic sources beneath it. © 2012 The Author(s).",Calluna vulgaris

However, data on the basic physicochemical properties of PFASs are scarce. To fill part of the data gaps, improved quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models for prediction of PFAS properties are developed based on the correlation between reported experimental data and molecular descriptors (fluorine number, molar volume and total surface area). Properties include vapor pressure, aqueous solubility, octanol/water partition coefficient, air/water partition coefficient and octanol/air partition coefficient. The fluorine number-descriptor model is based on good statistical results. However, this model cannot distinguish among PFASs with the same number of attached fluorines. Setting aside the fluorine number-descriptor models, models based on molar volume are statistically better than those based on total surface area. Therefore, The PFAS data obtained from the molar volume descriptor model are more reliable than from fluorine number and total surface area descriptor models. These results are intended to improve the understanding of the behavior and fate of PFASs in the environment, at contaminated sites and during remediation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, few studies that assess the advances of diffuse pollution modeling and studies of trace diffuse pollutants have been conducted. The adaption and development of imported model systems based on local observations and climatic features have improved study skills and presented unique characteristics. In addition to traditional diffuse pollutants (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus), modeling trace heavy metals and pesticide also provides insights for watershed management. Materials and methods: We reviewed existing literature on diffuse pollution model applications and developments in China, attempting to provide a better understanding of the advances of diffuse pollution and new research directions for pollution modeling. Results and discussion: Diverse methods have been adopted to express diffuse pollution formation, transport and environmental impacts using modeling as an effective tool for developing management guidelines in China. Model applications at different temporal–spatial scales, development of diffuse pollution modeling for emerging pollutants, and impacts of diffuse pollution on water quality in China were analyzed. Pollution loading decreased from east to west, coinciding with farmland distributions, tillage intensity, and economic levels. The temporal patterns of pollution loading have increased in recent decades due to increased fertilizer additions and climate warming which has put more pressure on water quality. This analysis indicated that enhancing existing models, with more field observations, is key for future diffuse pollution studies of trace organic pollutants and heavy metals. Establishing national databases and validating standard model parameters are essential and currently weak points at the national scale with respect to diffuse pollution modeling. Conclusions: Diffuse pollution has become a challenging issue in watershed management, and agricultural diffuse pollution poses the greatest risk to watershed management in China. However, the mechanisms involved in trace pollutant transport and the environmental consequences of these pollutants are largely unknown in China, where complicated tillage methods are used and climatic conditions vary throughout the country. Accumulated field observations at diverse temporal–spatial scales are important to accurately model and perform water risk assessments. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",agricultural land; basin management; database; guideline; numerical model; pollutant transport; pollution monitoring; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; tillage; water quality; watershed; China

Halocins and sulfolobicins are produced by archaea belonging to the order Halobacteriales (Euryarchaeota) and Sulfolobales (Crenarchaeota), respectively. These weapons contribute helping the producer to prosper in spite of the microbial warfare. Given the fact that many archaea thrive in various extreme environments, archaeocins are challenged with inhospitable and destructive environmental conditions. Their structural features and mechanisms of action, which could be original, mostly remain to be deciphered. This review summarizes the present knowledge on halocins and sulfolobicins, the two classes of archaeocins that have been evidenced until now, and brings light on aspects of emerging research such as their ecological role or potential applications.

NA,Impact of Contaminants on Microbiota: Linking the Gut–Brain Axis with Neurotoxicity,2022,NA,NA,"Over the last years, research has focused on microbiota to establish a missing link between neuronal health and intestine imbalance. Many studies have considered microbiota as critical regulators of the gut–brain axis. The crosstalk between microbiota and the central nervous system is mainly explained through three different pathways: the neural, endocrine, and immune pathways, intricately interconnected with each other. In day-to-day life, human beings are exposed to a wide variety of contaminants that affect our intestinal microbiota and alter the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, causing neuronal disorders. The interplay between xenobiotics, microbiota and neurotoxicity is still not fully explored, especially for susceptible populations such as pregnant women, neonates, and developing children. Precisely, early exposure to contaminants can trigger neurodevelopmental toxicity and long-term diseases. There is growing but limited research on the specific mechanisms of the microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA), making it challenging to understand the effect of environmental pollutants. In this review, we discuss the biological interplay between microbiota–gut–brain and analyse the role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals: Bisphenol A (BPA), Chlorpyrifos (CPF), Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in MGBA perturbations and subsequent neurotoxicity. The complexity of the MGBA and the changing nature of the gut microbiota pose significant challenges for future research. However, emerging in-silico models able to analyse and interpret meta-omics data are a promising option for understanding the processes in this axis and can help prevent neurotoxicity. © 2022 by the authors.

In this article, we review recent advances in the use of hydrogenated-fluorinated surfactant mixtures to achieve interfacial patterning. For even relatively simple systems comprised of binary mixed monolayers of hydrogenated and perfluorinated fatty acids, a diverse range of film morphologies can be generated at the air-water interface and successfully transferred onto solid substrates. Systematic investigations reported over the past several years have allowed for correlation between the chemical structure of the film constituents with the gross film morphology and underlying crystalline structure of the films. Early thermodynamic models based on the interplay between dipole-dipole repulsion forces between charged headgroups balanced by line tension between phases that were formulated to describe phase-behavior in simple phospholipid monolayer systems have proven highly useful to describe morphologies for the immiscible surfactant blends. Beyond simple binary fatty acid mixtures, highly-structured films have also been reported in mixed phospholipid systems, which have found important application in controlling the physical, compositional and performance properties of lung surfactant mixtures, as well as in semifluorinated alkane monolayers which form unique, hemimicellar structures at both liquid and solid interfaces. We also describe advances in using these approaches to pattern photopolymerizable, luminescent surfactants, which have found extensive use in colorimetric and fluorometric sensing devices. The long-term outlook for this field, with an emphasis on potential applications and future research directions are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Air; Binary mixtures; Bins; Fatty acids; Fluorocarbons; Hydrogenation; Interfaces (materials); Mixtures; Monolayers; Morphology; Phase separation; Phospholipids; Separation; Surface active agents; Crystalline structure; Fluorinated surfactant; Future research directions; Patterning; Performance properties; Phospholipid monolayers; Semifluorinated alkanes; Surfactant monolayers; Phase interfaces

Optimal resolution was obtained with a microemulsion consisting of 70 mM octane, 800 mM 1-butanol, 100 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 10 mM phosphate-borate buffer (pH 7) using a fused-silica capillary at 25 kV and 40°C. Since this technique is not compatible with mass spectrometry detection, a capillary electrochromatographic method was developed to separate the investigated withanolides. The effects of mobile phase composition and pH were systematically investigated. Complete separation was obtained with a capillary electrochromatography (CEC) Hypersil C18 bonded silica column (packed length, 25 cm × 100 μm ID and 375 μm OD), packed with 3 μm particles. The mobile phase consisted of formic acid-ammonia, pH 8 / acetonitrile (40/60 v/v); the voltage was set at 25 kV and the temperature at 20°C. Under these conditions, resolution of these closely related compounds, including the critical pair withacnistin and iochromolide, was achieved in less than 5 min. The separations by MEEKC and CEC were compared with that obtained by reversed-phase liquid chromatography and showed similar retention order, indicating the analogy of the retention mechanism of these techniques. To further improve specificity and sensitivity, the developed CEC method was interfaced with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a Teflon connection between the CEC column and a void fused-silica capillary. Finally, the described methods were applied to the qualitative analysis of withanolides in lochroma gesnerioides plant extract.","acetonitrile; ammonia; boric acid; buffer; butanol; dodecyl sulfate sodium; formic acid; iochromolide; octane; phosphate; plant extract; politef; silicon dioxide; steroid; unclassified drug; withacnistin; withaferin A; withanolide; capillary electrochromatography; capillary electrophoresis; chemical composition; controlled study; diode; drug isolation; drug structure; electric potential; intermethod comparison; mass spectrometry; micellar electrokinetic chromatography; microemulsion; nonhuman; particle size; pH; phase separation; qualitative analysis; reversed phase liquid chromatography; review; sensitivity and specificity; separation technique; temperature; Chromatography, Micellar Electrokinetic Capillary; Ergosterol; Indicators and Reagents; Lactones; Plant Extracts; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization; Withania"

This review focuses on new information regarding the pathophysiology of dense deposit disease, its appearance histopathologically, its relationship to other diseases including macular degeneration and acquired partial lipodystrophy and potential new therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: The microscopic features of dense deposit disease have been separated into five patterns with only about 25% of patients showing membranoproliferative features. The subtle interplay between genetic changes in complement regulatory proteins and dysregulation of the alternative pathway of complement is now more evident. Haplotype mapping has shown at-risk phenotypes of complement factor H associated with the development of dense deposit disease. Treatment protocols are empiric and not very effective. New information on complement inhibitors and plasma exchange, however, has brought hope for new therapies in the near future. SUMMARY: Understanding of the pathology and the pathophysiology of dense deposit disease has advanced rapidly in the last decade. New efforts in genetic mapping along with the development of novel inhibitors of the complement system will lead to improved care for patients afflicted with this uncommon condition. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","adipsin; anticoagulant agent; antithrombocytic agent; complement component C1; complement component C3; complement component C3b; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement factor H; corticosteroid; cytotoxic agent; eculizumab; immunoglobulin; adipose tissue; autoimmunity; clinical feature; complement inhibition; complement system; dense deposit disease; disease association; gene mutation; haplotype; histopathology; human; immunofluorescence; innate immunity; lipodystrophy; lupus erythematosus nephritis; membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; nonhuman; pathophysiology; pediatrics; phenotype; plasmapheresis; priority journal; retina macula degeneration; review; swine; Animals; Complement Factor H; Complement Inactivating Agents; Complement Pathway, Alternative; Complement System Proteins; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Glomerular Basement Membrane; Glomerulonephritis, Membranoproliferative; Humans; Kidney Transplantation; Lipodystrophy; Macular Degeneration"

In this review we critically evaluate the current state of the science regarding human early life exposure processes (until 18 years of age) to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Efficient placental transfer of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) results in relatively high prenatal exposure compared with many neutral organic contaminants. The few biomonitoring studies that specifically target infants, toddlers and other children suggest relatively high serum concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in early life with peak concentrations occurring sometime before the child reaches 20 months. This peak in serum concentrations is most likely explained by exposure via breastfeeding, ingestion of house dust and/or specific contact events with consumer products leading to high body weight normalized estimated daily intakes (EDIs). Although children have higher EDIs of PFASs than adults, these are not always reflected by higher serum levels of PFASs in children in cross-sectional biomonitoring studies due to the confounding effect of age and birth cohort, and different exposure histories due to production changes. Longitudinal exposure studies measuring internal and external exposure (for multiple pathways and PFASs) at several time points during early life are strongly encouraged to understand temporal changes in exposure of individual children. A better quantitative understanding of early life exposure processes would help to improve the validity of epidemiological studies and allow informed decisions regarding setting of regulatory thresholds and appropriate mitigation actions. © 2017 The Authors",NA

This peculiar pattern of dissociated atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles is termed the 'split hand' and is rarely seen in diseases other than ALS. The muscles involved in the split hand are innervated through the same spinal segments (C8 and T1), and FDI and ADM, which are differentially affected, are both ulnar nerve innervated. The physiological mechanisms underlying the split hand in ALS are incompletely understood but both cortical and spinal/peripheral mechanisms are probably involved. Motor potentials evoked by magnetic stimulation are significantly smaller when recorded from the thenar complex, compared with the hypothenar muscles, supporting a cortical mechanism. But peripheral axonal excitability studies have suggested that APB/FDI motor axons have more prominent persistent sodium currents than ADM axons, leading to higher axonal excitability and thereby more ready degeneration. Pincer or precision grip is vital to human hand function, and frequent use of thenar complex muscles may lead to greater oxidative stress and metabolic demands at both upper and lower motoneurons innervating the APB and FDI. The split hand is a useful diagnostic sign in early ALS, and recent objective studies indicate that the sign has a high degree of specificity.",amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ectrodactyly; evoked muscle response; grip strength; human; motoneuron; muscle innervation; nerve cell excitability; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; patient assessment; priority journal; review; sensitivity and specificity; sodium current

Essentially the early phase of prosthetic incorporation (phase I) includes exudative inflammatory reactions as part of acute inflammatory processes. The degree of order within the tissue architecture and the mutual influence of matrix and cells in the reaction appeared to be slight. The cellular infiltrate found on the outer prosthetic surface is of local origin whereas the inner prosthetic lining contains cells of haematogenous origin. The organisation phase (phase II), which is comparable to the reparative-proliferative phase of an inflammatory reaction, showed activation of the reticulo-endothelial system together with the start of phagocytosis and a thinning of the prosthetic structures. Collagen type I and type III and fibronectin served both as a guidance and a growth tract for the cells during the cellular permeation of the prosthesis. Fibronectin and collagen type III have a special ""catalytic"" function. Collagen type I causes the firm anchoring of the vascular prosthesis in the periprosthetic tissue. The loss of stability of the prosthesis due to phagocytosis of fibres is balanced by the newly formed connective tissue within the wall of the vessel. The fibroblasts involved in the organisation must be derived from the flowing blood and from local mesenchymal cells. A chronic inflammatory reaction persisted during the late phase. In some cases increased proliferation of the inner mesenchymal lining of the prosthesis was observed together with regressive changes. The lack of a continuous surrounding stromal architecture on the luminal side of the vessel can be regarded as the main reason for this proliferation. Transformation of haematogenous cells into angioblasts or endothelial cells was not seen. Small endothelialised areas were only seen in the vicinity of anastomoses and following transprosthetic permeation by capillaries.",blood vessel prosthesis; human; prosthesis; review; Blood Vessel Prosthesis; Humans; Prosthesis Design; MLCS; MLOWN

The wire‐guided sphincterotome allows the endoscopist to maintain direct access to the biliary tree before or after the sphincterotomy. It has the additional advantages of allowing for more expeditious placement of accessories and being useful in combined percutaneous‐endoscopic procedures. There are two basic designs of wire‐guided sphincterotomes. The single‐channel model has a single lumen for both the cutting wire and guidewire and requires guidewire removal before the application of power. The double‐channel model has two separate lumens for the guidewire and stainless steel cutting wire. In vitro data suggest that significant capacitive coupling currents (or short circuits) may occur on the standard Teflon‐coated guidewire when used with a double lumen sphincterotome, resulting in elec‐trosurgical burns. Thus, the manufacturers of the double‐lumen models recommend removing the Teflon‐coated wire before performing sphincterotomy.

Although the pneumococcal capsule has been considered a sine qua non for virulence, the emergence of pathogenic nonencapsulated strains with newly recognized virulence determinants has also been described. Not unexpectedly, but of concern, nonencapsulated strains are unaffected by current pneumococcal vaccines. This, together with the finding of novel virulence factors, as well as new mechanisms of pathogenicity of established virulence determinants, underscores the resilience of the pneumococcus in confronting challenges in its environment, most importantly those posed by antibiotics and vaccines.SummaryRecent advances in the understanding of pneumococcal virulence factors provide potential opportunities for the development of novel putative therapeutic or preventive strategies.

Concentrations of PFCs in air and dust samples collected from home, office, and vehicle were outlined. The results showed that neutral PFCs (e.g., fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and perfluorooctane sulfonamide ethanols (FOSEs)) should be given attention in addition to PFOS and PFOA. We summarized PFC concentrations in various food items, including vegetables, dairy products, beverages, eggs, meat products, fish, and shellfish. We showed that humans are subject to the dietary PFC exposure mostly through fish and shellfish consumption. Concentrations of PFCs in different drinking water samples collected from various countries were analyzed. Well water and tap water contained relatively higher PFC concentrations than other types of drinking water. Furthermore, PFC contamination in drinking water was influenced by the techniques for drinking water treatment and bottle-originating pollution. © 2017","Bottles; Dairies; Dust; Fish; Fish products; Food products; Meats; Shellfish; Sulfur compounds; Water pollution; Water treatment; Drinking water samples; Exposure; Fish and shellfishes; Fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs); Global distribution; Indoor air; Perfluorochemical; Perfluorooctane sulfonamide; Potable water; alcohol derivative; drinking water; fluorotelomer alcohol; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; unclassified drug; drinking water; fluorinated hydrocarbon; chemical compound; drinking water; global perspective; indoor air; pollutant source; pollution exposure; polymer; ambient air; beverage; dairy product; dust; egg; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; fish; food; geographic distribution; human; meat; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; shellfish; vegetable; water contamination; analysis; animal; environmental monitoring; food analysis; Animals; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Food Analysis; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated"

In Latin America there are limited reports on environmental monitoring of EPs and it is generally focused on wastewater. This review identifies the current research deficiencies for emerging contaminants in the Latin American region, and we address the case of nonylphenol as an under-studied EP in the region. Nonylphenol is a degradation product of nonylphenol ethoxylate, which is a surfactant widely used in the manufacture of detergents in Latin America, environmental concentrations have been reported, predominantly in water, and the possible effects on species in this region have been also described. The importance of the review of this compound in the region lies in the fact that the Rotterdam Convention has catalogued nonylphenol as a severely restricted compound, so it is necessary to establish measures for its restriction and change to a sustainable technology. Finally, the example of NP presented in this review highlights the lack of regulation in Latin America regarding to EPs, resulting in the contamination of wastewater, effluents, rivers and drinking water.

The cellular and molecular events by which PPARα activators induce rodent hepatocarcinogenesis has been extensively studied and elucidated. This review summarizes the weight of evidence relevant to the hypothesized mode of action (MOA) for PPARα activator-induced rodent hepatocarcinogenesis and identifies gaps in our knowledge of this MOA. Chemical-specific and mechanistic data support concordance of temporal and dose-response relationships for the key events associated with many PPARα activators including a phthalate ester plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and the drug gemfibrozil. While biologically plausible in humans, the hypothesized key events in the rodent MOA, for PPARα activators, are unlikely to induce liver tumors in humans because of toxicodynamic and biological differences in responses. This conclusion is based on minimal or no effects observed on growth pathways, hepatocellular proliferation and liver tumors in humans and/or species (including hamsters, guinea pigs and cynomolgous monkeys) that are more appropriate human surrogates than mice and rats at overlapping dose levels. Overall, the panel concluded that significant quantitative differences in PPARα activator-induced effects related to liver cancer formation exist between rodents and humans. On the basis of these quantitative differences, most of the workgroup felt that the rodent MOA is ""not relevant to humans"" with the remaining members concluding that the MOA is ""unlikely to be relevant to humans"". The two groups differed in their level of confidence based on perceived limitations of the quantitative and mechanistic knowledge of the species differences, which for some panel members strongly supports but cannot preclude the absence of effects under unlikely exposure scenarios. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","ciprofibrate; clofibrate; cyclin D1; cyclin dependent kinase 1; cyclin dependent kinase 4; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; messenger RNA; methylclofenapate; nafenopin; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; pirinixic acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; trichloroacetic acid; cell communication; cell proliferation; DNA damage; enzyme activation; gap junction; gene expression profiling; guinea pig; hamster; human; hypolipemia; Kupffer cell; liver cancer; liver carcinogenesis; liver cell; liver tumor; macrophage; nonhuman; oxidative stress; review; risk assessment; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Diethylhexyl Phthalate; Gemfibrozil; Humans; Liver Neoplasms, Experimental; Plasticizers; PPAR alpha; Risk Assessment; Species Specificity"

The causes are multifactorial and include acute blood loss, blood loss from diagnostic testing and blunted red blood cell production. Blood transfusions are frequently given to patients in intensive care units to treat low hemoglobin levels due to either acute blood loss or subacute anemia associated with critical illness. Although blood transfusion is a life-saving therapy, evidence suggests that it may be associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. A number of blood conservation strategies exist that may mitigate anemia in hospital patients and limit the need for transfusion. These strategies include the use of hemostatic agents, hemoglobin substitutes and blood salvage techniques, the reduction of blood loss associated with diagnostic testing, the use of erythropoietin and the use of restrictive blood transfusion triggers. Strategies to reduce blood loss associated with diagnostic testing and the use of hemostatic agents and erythropoietin result in higher hemoglobin levels, but they have not been shown to reduce the need for blood transfusions or to improve clinical outcomes. Lowering the hemoglobin threshold at which blood is transfused will reduce the need for transfusions and is not associated with increased morbidity or mortality among most critically ill patients without active cardiac disease.

Leukocyte reduction has not proved effective, however, in preventing febrile reactions after platelet transfusions in alloimmunized patients. To reduce the risk of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, new recommendations for the irradiation of blood components have been made. They include the irradiation of donor units from all blood relatives of the recipient and an increase in the recommended dose of irradiation to 2,500 cGy. Current investigations of both hemoglobin-based and fluorocarbon-based blood substitutes may improve the safety and efficacy of transfusion therapy in the future.

Although other weak interactions and their influence on the structure and chemistry of various molecules, complexes and materials have been investigated thoroughly, the field of halogen bonding is still quite unexplored and its impact on chemistry in general is yet to be fully revealed. In principle, every Y-X bond (Y = electron-withdrawing atom or moiety, X = halogen atom) can act as a halogen-bond donor when the halogen is polarized enough by Y. Perfluorohalocarbons are iconic halogen-bond donor molecules in which Y is a perfluorinated aryl or alkyl moiety and X is either iodine or bromine. In this article, alternative halogen-bond motifs such as X 2···A and Ar-X···A [A = Lewis basic halogen-bond-accepting atom of a molecule or ion; Ar = neutral or charged (hetero)aromatic system] are reviewed. In addition, haloalkenes, haloalkynes, N-haloamides and other non-metallic halogen-bond donors and their respective halogen-bonded structures will also be described. Although purely organic halogen-bonding motifs are very prominent, the role of metal complexes in halogen bonding is becoming increasingly evident as well, which is also reflected in this review. Finally, halogen bonding in solution is briefly highlighted. Contemporary research is proving that halogen bonding is more than a solid-state phenomenon and is now a well-recognized weak interaction in chemistry. Halogen bonding is an attractive non-covalent interaction between an electrophilic halogen donor atom and a nucleophilic acceptor atom. The figure depicts halogen bonds between the electrophilic iodine atoms of four N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) molecules and the nucleophilic nitrogen atoms of hexamethylenetetraamine (HMTA).

NA,Impact of perfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS) exposure on maternal and newborn health in Veneto region,2018,NA,NA,"Background. Perfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS) are persistent organic pollutants that accumulate in the fish, wildlife, and humans. In 2013, it has been discovered an area of the Veneto Region in which ground water, surface water, and drinking water were contaminated by PFAS. Appropriate interventions have been undertaken to contain the water pollution, reducing it effectively. However, it has been estimated that the contamination had started about fifty years before its discovery, leading to the long-term exposure of the population. The long-term exposure to PFAS is worrying because PFAS have been suggested to affect human health. Veneto Region has therefore organized a health surveillance programme of the population living in the polluted area. A specific aspect of such programme concerns the maternal and newborn health, which represents the focus of my PhD research project. The aims of the project were to review animal and human evidence related to this topic and to assess the effects of the exposure to PFAS on maternal and newborn health in the population living in the polluted area of Veneto Region. Methods. The systematic review included relevant studies in the English language identified through the online database PubMed. Studies were eligible to the review if they assess the effect of PFAS exposure during the reproductive period on the health of the pregnant women and of the infant. The identification of the outcomes of interest assessed in the study about maternal and newborn health in Veneto Region was based on the systematic review. The outcomes investigated were preeclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (pregnancy complications), and intrauterine growth restriction, evaluated using a proxy of fetal growth, the Small for Gestational Age (SGA) (birth outcomes). The study was performed using an indirect measure of exposure to PFAS, defined as woman’s residence in the contaminated area (including 21 municipalities identified according to a Veneto Region Official Resolution). A control area that included 48 municipalities not exposed to PFAS contamination according to the performance limits of the National Institue of Health was chosen for comparision. The information sources included two administrative datasets, the Veneto Region Birth Registry and the Veneto Region hospital discharge records. For the pregnancy complications (preeclampsia and GDM), a medical chart review of pregnant women hospitalized is ongoing to validate the cases identified from the hospital discharge records. Results. The systematic review led to the retrieval of 1096 records from PubMed. One hundred and thirty-nine records were judged to be eligible to the study. Overall, evidence retrieved suggests that PFAS exposure might affect the health of the pregnant woman and the development of the fetus. The epidemiological study showed that newborns of mothers living in the contaminated area were significantly more likely to be SGA compared to newborns of mothers living in the control area (adjusted Odds Ratio 1.26, 95% C.I. 1.14-1.38). Looking at pregnancy complications (preeclampsia and GDM), preliminary results were available because the review of the medical chart is ongoing. Such preliminary results seem to suggest that the frequency of these pathological conditions is slightly higher in women living in the contaminated area compared to those living in the control ones. However, they must be taken with caution because the validation of preeclampsia and GDM cases is ongoing. Conclusions. The results of the present research project suggest that PFAS exposure might affect maternal and newborn health. The present topic deserves further research, not only from the epidemiological point of view, but also for what concerns the pathophysiological mechanisms potentially involved in the association between PFAS exposure and adverse health outcomes in pregnant women and newborns.",NA

Interactions between ozone depletion and global climate change will significantly alter atmospheric chemistry which, in turn, will cause changes in concentrations of natural and human-made gases and aerosols. Models predict that tropospheric ozone near the surface will increase globally by up to 10 to 30 ppbv (33 to 100% increase) during the period 2000 to 2100. With the increase in the amount of the stratospheric ozone, increased transport from the stratosphere to the troposphere will result in different responses in polluted and unpolluted areas. In contrast, global changes in tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH) are not predicted to be large, except where influenced by the presence of oxidizable organic matter, such as from large-scale forest fires. Recent measurements in a relatively clean location over 5 years showed that OH concentrations can be predicted by the intensity of solar ultraviolet radiation. If this relationship is confirmed by further observations, this approach could be used to simplify assessments of air quality. Analysis of surface-level ozone observations in Antarctica suggests that there has been a significant change in the chemistry of the boundary layer of the atmosphere in this region as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion. The oxidation potential of the Antarctic boundary layer is estimated to be greater now than before the development of the ozone hole. Recent modeling studies have suggested that iodine and iodine-containing substances from natural sources, such as the ocean, may increase stratospheric ozone depletion significantly in polar regions during spring. Given the uncertainty of the fate of iodine in the stratosphere, the results may also be relevant for stratospheric ozone depletion and measurements of the influence of these substances on ozone depletion should be considered in the future. In agreement with known usage and atmospheric loss processes, tropospheric concentrations of HFC-134a, the main human-made source of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), is increasing rapidly. As HFC-134a is a potent greenhouse gas, this increasing concentration has implications for climate change. However, the risks to humans and the environment from substances, such as TFA, produced by atmospheric degradation of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are considered minimal. Perfluoropolyethers, commonly used as industrial heat transfer fluids and proposed as chlorohydrofluorocarbon (CHFC) substitutes, show great stability to chemical degradation in the atmosphere. These substances have been suggested as substitutes for CHFCs but, as they are very persistent in the atmosphere, they may be important contributors to global warming. It is not known whether these substances will contribute significantly to global warming and its interaction with ozone depletion but they should be considered for further evaluation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies.",chlorofluorohydrocarbon; fluorinated hydrocarbon; hydroxyl radical; iodine; norflurane; ozone; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoropolyether; polyether derivative; sulfur dioxide; trifluoroacetic acid; unclassified drug; air pollution; air quality; Antarctica; climate change; dissociation constant; geochemistry; global climate; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; heat transfer; industrialization; meteorology; ozonolysis; photolysis; priority journal; review; solar radiation; stratosphere; troposphere; ultraviolet radiation; Air; Air Pollution; Atmosphere; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Ozone; Photolysis

PLV is under development as a treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome and other forms of acute respiratory failure. The fluid currently in clinical trials is perfluorooctyl bromide, an inert, nonbiodegradable perfluorocarbon which is immiscible with water and very poorly absorbed from the alveolus. It is an avid solvent for oxygen and carbon dioxide and has a remarkably low surface tension. When instilled into the surfactant deficient lung or the lung with surfactant dysfunction, it reduces surface tension at the alveolar lining. The liquid also occupies air spaces, so its presence in the lung recruits atelectatic alveoli. It may also facilitate recruitment by enhancing removal of secretions. There is now evidence that perflubron modulates pulmonary inflammation and that its presence stretches the lung and promotes de novo synthesis of endogenous surfactant. Preclinical evidence suggests that, by several mechanisms, perflubron PLV improves both gas exchange and outcome in animal models of lung disease.

Although the TMF has been recognized as the most reliable tool for assessing the biomagnification of organic contaminants, peer-reviewed studies reporting TMFs for PFAS are few and with limited geographical distribution. We found 25 published studies of the biomagnification of 35 specific PFAS, for which the TMF was generated through linear regression of individual log-PFAS concentration and the δ15N-based trophic position of each organism in the food webs. Studies were concentrated mainly in China, North America, and Europe, and the most investigated compound was perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), which was frequently shown to be biomagnified in the food web (TMFs ranging from 0.8 to 20). Other long-chain carboxylates displayed substantial variation in trophic magnification. Observed differences in the TMF were associated with length of the food web, geographic location, sampling methodologies, tissue analyzed, and distance from known direct PFAS inputs. In addition to biomagnification of legacy PFAS, precursor substances were observed to bioaccumulate in the food web, which suggests they may biotransform to more persistent PFAS compounds in upper trophic levels. This review discusses the variability of environmental characteristics driving PFAS biomagnification in natural ecosystems and highlights the different approaches used by each study, which can make comparisons among studies challenging. Suggestions on how to standardize TMFs for PFAS are also provided in this review. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2022;00:1–13. © 2022 SETAC. © 2022 SETAC",NA

The most advanced scopes are related to hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbons emulsions. The limitations of free hemoglobin impose to modify it. The reestablishment of a normal, even reduced, affinity for oxygen is obtained by the fixation on hemoglobin of a 2,3-DPG substitute whose most known example is pyridoxal phosphate. The enhancement of vascular retention may be achieved by intramolecular cross-linking, intermolecular polymerization or covalent binding of hemoglobin on macromolecules. The two modifications of hemoglobin must be performned successively at numerous possibilities have been proposed. Bovine and recombinant hemoglobins are also promising. Originally and logically, fluorocarbons are synthetic compounds derived from hydrocarbons by an important or maximal substitution of hydrogen by fluorine. The physical properties of these molecules, impose, for transfusion, their emulsification in an aqueous physiological solution. They need an oxygen enriched atmosphere and their storage in tissues is often extended. At present, the most known emulsion is Fluosol DA, a mixture of perfluorodecalin and perfluorotripropylamine. It allowed to realize numerous researchs and the proposal of the multiple possible employments for this category of oxygen carriers. The limitations of Fluosol DA led to fluorocarbons under investigation such as F dimethyl bicyclononanes, F methyladamantane, bis (F-butyl) ethene or F-octylbromide.

Conversion of lignocellulose biomass to liquid fuel is one of the research hotpots because biomass is a renewable and sustainable resource. This paper outlines an attractive strategy for the production of liquid transport fuels from lignocellulose biomass. Specifically, hemicellulose and cellulose are converted to C5 and C6 alkanes (bio-gasoline) and C8–C15 alkanes (aviation fuel) via C5/C6 platform molecules, and lignin is converted to arenes and cyclanes via phenolic monomers and dimers through hydrodeoxygenation. The focus is to review the state-of-the-art technologies for the preparation of platform molecules, the synthesis of light/heavy alkanes, lignin depolymerization and catalytic hydrodeoxygenation.

When used to emulsify fluorocarbons, as for in vivo oxygen transport, such compounds can confer emulsion stability and a certain control over particle size. Considerable emulsion stabilization and improved control over particle size are also obtained by using a combination of standard phospholipids and mixed fluorocarbon-hydrocarbon compounds such as 3a or 3c. The highly fluorinated chains of 1 and 2 generate strong hydrophobic interactions, which enhance the tendency for these fluorinated amphiphiles to form vesicles (F-vesicles). This is strikingly demonstrated by the fact that even the short, single-chain perfluoroalkylated phosphocholine derivatives 1a and 1c readily form stable, heatsterilizable vesicles and other supramolecular assemblies, including globules and fibers without the need for any additive. The F-alkylated phosphatidylcholines 2 also form unusually stable, heat-sterilizable, small unilamellar vesicles with long room temperature shelf-life. The presence of a fluorinated core within the membrane of F-vesicles results in lower permeability to both hydrophilic and lipophilic encapsulated species. The solubilization of the paramagnetic probe Tempo in the membrane is, in most cases, totally suppressed. The release of entrapped 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein from F-vesicles is considerably slower than from liposomes made from hydrocarbon analogs; it is also less affected by serum components. Also noteworthy is the significantly prolonged intravascular persistence observed for F-vesicles made from 2e and 2f compared to DSPC or DSPC/cholesterol liposomes. Stable vesicles with a fluorinated core are also obtained from equimolar combinations of standard phospholipids and mixed hydrocarbon-fluorocarbon molecules such as 3. Preliminary biological results, which include very low hemolytic activity, reduced hydrolysis by PLA2 of phospholipids when combined with appropriate fluorocarbon-hydrocarbon compounds, decreased protein adsorption and phagocytic uptake in serum of microspheres coated with fluorinated surfactants and, in some cases, very high LD50 values i.v. in mice, are encouraging and should trigger further investigations on the pharmacology of such surfactants. © 1995 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

However, the widespread use of sunscreens and other personal care products containing these filters has led to these compounds being widely detected in the environment and being identified as emerging pollutants in marine waters. Concerns raised by laboratory studies investigating the potential impact of UV filters on coral communities have already led to bans on the use of some sunscreens in a few tourist hotspots. Although UV filter pollution may be just one of the many environmental factors impacting coral health worldwide, the media attention surrounding these studies and the legislative changes may lead patients to question dermatologists about the environmental safety of some sunscreen products. This review provides an overview of current knowledge on the impact of UV filters on marine ecosystems, concentrating on recent studies examining the effects of commonly used filters on organisms at low trophic levels and of how alternative approaches, such as metabolomics, can be used to further assess UV filter ecotoxicity. Current gaps in our knowledge are also discussed, most notably the need to increase our understanding of the longer-term fate and behaviour of UV filters in the marine environment, develop more adapted standardized ecotoxicity tests for a wider range of marine species, and evaluate the impact of UV filters on the marine food web. We then discuss future perspectives for the development of new, more environmentally friendly, filters that may enable the use of the most toxic compounds to be reduced without compromising the effectiveness of sunscreen formulations. Finally, we consider how dermatologists play a key role in educating patients on the need for a balanced approach to sun exposure, sun protection, and conservation of the marine environment. © 2022 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.",coral reef; ecotoxicity; fish; food web; marine environment; metabolomics; nonhuman; photodegradation; Review; sediment

The reduction in islet mass during pancreas preservation, islet isolation, and islet transplantation leads to β-cell death by apoptosis and the prerecruitment of intracellular death signaling pathways, such as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), which is one of the stress groups of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).

The pathogenesis of pediatric ARDS remains controversial. Among the many causes the most common is lower respiratory tract infection, usually due to a virus. There is general agreement that trauma related to assisted ventilation adds to or perpetuates the initial alveolocapillary insult. In patients without immunodepression or failure of other organs, the prognosis of pediatric ARDS has probably been improved by recent advances in ventilatory assistance techniques used in pediatric intensive care units. All cause mortality remains between 30% and 50%. The management of pediatric ARDS is discussed in the light of current pathophysiological concepts.

Some complications occur mainly at the first use of a dialyzer: a new cellophane or cuprophane membrane may activate the complement system, or a noxious agent may be introduced to the dialyzer during production or generated during storage. These agents may not be completely removed during the routine rinsing procedure. The reuse of dialyzers is associated with environmental contamination, allergic reactions, residual chemical infusion (rebound release), inadequate concentration of disinfectants, and pyrogen reactions. Bleach used during reprocessing causes a progressive increase in dialyzer permeability to larger molecules, including albumin. Reprocessing methods without the use of bleach are associated with progressive decreases in membrane permeability, particularly to larger molecules. Most comparative studies have not shown differences in mortality between centers reusing and those not reusing dialyzers, however, the largest cluster of dialysis-related deaths occurred with single-use dialyzers due to the presence of perfluorohydrocarbon introduced during the manufacturing process and not completely removed during preparation of the dialyzers before the dialysis procedure. The cost savings associated with reuse is substantial, especially with more expensive, high-flux synthetic membrane dialyzers. With reuse, some dialysis centers can afford to utilize more efficient dialyzers that are more expensive; consequently they provide a higher dose of dialysis and reduce mortality. Some studies have shown minimally higher morbidity with chemical reuse, depending on the method. Waste disposal is definitely decreased with the reuse of dialyzers, thus environmental impacts are lessened, particularly if reprocessing is done by heat disinfection. It is safe to predict that dialyzer reuse in dialysis centers will continue because it also saves money for the providers. Saving both time for the patient and money for the provider were the main motivations to design a new machine for daily home hemodialysis. The machine, developed in the 1990s, cleans and heat disinfects the dialyzer and lines in situ so they do not need to be changed for a month. In contrast, reuse of dialyzers in home hemodialysis patients treated with other hemodialysis machines is becoming less popular and is almost extinct.","biomaterial; cellophane; cellulose; cuprophane; disinfectant agent; drug derivative; ethylene oxide; hemodialysis fluid; anaphylaxis; artificial membrane; chemically induced disorder; complement activation; disinfection; drug effect; equipment; human; neutropenia; recycling; review; Anaphylaxis; Biocompatible Materials; Cellophane; Cellulose; Complement Activation; Disinfectants; Disinfection; Equipment Contamination; Equipment Reuse; Ethylene Oxide; Hemodialysis Solutions; Humans; Membranes, Artificial; Neutropenia"

Radiofrequency, with typically used frequencies of approximately 500 kHz, does not cause pain and is unlikely to induce atrial or ventricular fibrillation. It can be used either to ablate (higher power (35-50W); longer duration of application (90-120 sec); lower voltage (30-50V)) or to perforate (lower power (5-10W) shorter duration of application (1-5 sec), higher voltage (150-280V)). In the past, perforating radiofrequency has been applied to establish right ventricular outflow tract patency in pulmonary atresia with intact septum and with ventricular septal defect. More recently radiofrequency has been shown to be effective at recanalizing central and peripheral vasculature and has also been applied in establishing percutaneous left heart access.

The etiology of preterm birth has not yet been elucidated. Although maternal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase the risk for preterm birth, associations have not been confirmed. We performed a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationships between maternal exposure to EDCs and preterm birth. A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid-EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies providing quantitative data on the association between maternal EDC exposure and preterm birth in humans was conducted in July 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. A total of 59 studies were included. The pooled results indicated that maternal exposure to metals (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.29) and phthalates (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.42) was related to an increased risk for preterm birth. Specifically, maternal exposure to lead, cadmium, chromium, copper and manganese appeared to be correlated with an elevated risk for preterm birth. Additionally, maternal exposure to monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was also associated with preterm birth.

The objective of this literature review on PFASs is to give an overview of the information available about PFASs related to human exposure. The information from this literature review on the exposure of humans to PFASs through drinking water and the lack of many conventional drinking water treatment systems’ ability to remove PFASs (particularly short-chain PFASs) suggests that current regulatory limits are insufficient to adequately protect humans.

NA,Toxicological function of adipose tissue: Focus on persistent organic pollutants,2013,NA,NA,"Background: A dipose tissue (AT) is involved in several physiological functions, including metabolic regulation, energy storage, and endocrine functions. Objectives: In this review we examined the evidence that an additional function of AT is to modulate persistent organic pollutant (POP) toxicity through several mechanisms. Methods: We reviewed the literature on the interaction of AT with POPs to provide a comprehensive model for this additional function of AT. discussion: As a storage compartment for lipophilic POPs, AT plays a critical role in the toxico-kinetics of a variety of drugs and pollutants, in particular, POPs. By sequestering POPs, AT can protect other organs and tissues from POPs overload. However, this protective function could prove to be a threat in the long run. Te accumulation of lipophilic POPs will increase total body burden. These accumulated POPs are slowly released into the bloodstream, and more so during weight loss. Thus, AT constitutes a continual source of internal exposure to POPs. In addition to its buffering function, AT is also a target of POPs and may mediate part of their metabolic effects. This is particularly relevant because many POPs induce obesogenic effects that may lead to quantitative and qualitative alterations of AT. Some POPs also induce a proinflammatory state in AT, which may lead to detrimental metabolic effects. Conclusion: AT appears to play diverse functions both as a modulator and as a target of POPs toxicity.",NA

NA,Nexus between perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) and human thyroid dysfunction: A systematic review evidenced from laboratory investigations and epidemiological studies,2021,NA,NA,"Perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) have attracted massive attention in recent years for their endocrine-disrupting potential. This review summarizes the underlying evidence on the primary fate and in vitro/vivo toxic effects of PFCs and their interactions and relationships with thyroid dysfunction and cancer induction in exposed groups, including the general population, occupationally exposed groups, highly exposed individuals, and prone subjects (pregnant women and neonates). The potential endocrine-disrupting mechanism of PFCs may include multiple processes of thyroid malfunction or hormonal imbalance. The increased level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was observed as the most consistent outcome of PFC exposure among generally exposed populations. Specifically, the levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and TSH were significantly correlated among pregnant women. In some instances, the maternal PFC level was negatively correlated with the neonatal thyroxine (T4) level in serum. The PFCs and thyroid malfunction or thyroid hormone (TH) levels also revealed a potential association among the population under high-level environmental exposure, albeit not always following a strict exposure-response relationship. Moreover, occupational exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) showed a probable link with TH (excluding TSH) alterations in serum. Importantly, no concrete and statistically significant evidence highlighted the risk of thyroid cancer in humans exposed to PFCs. Highlights The first robust review describing the effects of PFCs on thyroid dysfunctions. PFC exposure induces sex- and age-specific responses in the human thyroid system.

GenX and PFOA have been detected in various natural water sources, and adsorption is recognized as a typical treatment process for PFOA removal. In this paper, comparisons of GenX and PFOA adsorption are evaluated, including adsorption potential, adsorption mechanisms, and associated costs. A detailed literature review suggests that anion-exchange resins are more effective in removing GenX than activated carbon. GenX removal efficiency through activated carbon (30%) is lower than that of PFOA (80–95%), while GenX and PFOA removal efficiencies by anion exchange resins are similar (99%). Unconventional adsorbents, such as ionic fluorogels and covalent organic frameworks can effectively remove GenX from water. The review reveals that GenX adsorption is more challenging, requiring almost 4 times the treatment cost of its predecessor, PFOA. Annual operation and maintenance costs for GenX adsorption (initial concentration of GenX and PFOA = 0.2 µg.L−1) by GAC for treating 10,000 m3 per day is almost US$1,000,000 per year, but only around US$240,000 per year for PFOA.

Many studies have highlighted outcomes and assessed their potential advantages, but much of the data on adverse outcomes are limited and often based on outdated technology. We aimed to review and summarize the available literature on insulin pump-associated adverse events in adults and children. Methods: A literature search was undertaken using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library. Articles were then screened by title, followed by abstract, and full text as needed. A by-hand search of reference lists in identified papers was also utilised. All searches were limited to English language material, but no time limits were used. Results: Current and past literature regarding insulin pump-associated adverse events is discussed, including potential metabolic and non-metabolic adverse events, in particular: pump malfunction; infusion set/site issues; and cutaneous problems. We show that even with modern technology, adverse events are common, occurring in over 40 % of users per year, with a minority, particularly in children, requiring hospital management. Hyperglycaemia and ketosis are now the most common consequences of adverse events and are usually associated with infusion set failure. This differs from older technology where infected infusion sites predominated. Conclusions: This timely review covers all potential insulin pump-associated adverse events, including their incidence, features, impacts, and contributory factors such as the pump user. The importance of ongoing anticipatory education and support for patients and families using this intensive insulin technology is highlighted, which if done well should improve the overall experience of pump therapy for users, and hopefully reduce the incidence and impact of severe adverse events. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Italia.","insulin; insulin aspart; insulin derivative; insulin glulisine; insulin lispro; recombinant human insulin; short acting insulin; antidiabetic agent; insulin; catheter dislocation; catheter occlusion; clinical feature; clinical trial (topic); convulsion; device failure; device infection; diabetes mellitus; diabetic ketoacidosis; drug delivery system; drug hypersensitivity; erythema; heart arrest; heart fibrillation; hospital management; human; hyperglycemia; hyperkalemia; hypoglycemia; incidence; indwelling catheter; insulin pump; ketoacidosis; lipoatrophy; lipohypertrophy; medical technology; metabolic disorder; patient education; precipitation; priority journal; pump malfunction; Review; risk reduction; scar formation; skin disease; skin infection; skin irritation; skin manifestation; skin nodule; social psychology; unspecified side effect; adult; adverse effects; child; complication; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; insulin infusion; meta analysis; Adult; Child; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incidence; Insulin; Insulin Infusion Systems"

Special attention has given to external contamination and the main analytical methods used to detect these compounds in feathers. Some authors have found strong and significant correlations between the concentrations of PHCs in feathers and internal tissues, providing positive expectations for their future use in the field of ecotoxicology. However, changes in diet, time elapsed between the previous molt period and sampling, sample size, and/or external contamination have been suggested as possible causes to explain the lack of correlations reported in some studies. Further studies with newly grown feathers and blood samples would be required in order to clarify this issue. Although atmospheric deposition has been reported as cause of external contamination, preening oil seems to be the most relevant factor contributing to this process. Unfortunately, washing techniques tested to date are not able to effectively remove the surface contamination from barbs and shafts, and therefore, it is necessary to develop methods able to discriminate between internal and external contamination. Finally, in this review, deposition rate is proposed as a measurement unit, as this allows comparisons between different parts of the same feather, as well as between different feathers. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",Deposition rates; Meteorological problems; Analytical method; Atmospheric depositions; Biomonitoring tools; External contamination; Internal tissues; Nondestructive tools; Polyhalogenated compounds; Surface contaminations; Contamination; chlordane; chlorphenotane; lindane; organochlorine pesticide; organohalogen derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polybrominated biphenyl; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polyhalogenated compound; unclassified drug; atmospheric deposition; biomonitoring; blood; concentration (composition); ecotoxicology; feather; molt; organohalogen; pollutant property; sampling; air pollutant; air pollution; analytic method; atmospheric deposition; bioaccumulation; biological monitoring; bird; blood sampling; body distribution; diet; feather; human; nonhuman; review; sample size; sampling; tissues

DCL residues have often been detected in freshwater environments and it belongs to the list of emerging pollutants (EPs) because of the risk it presents for health and environment. Many studies have described the potential effects of DCL on organisms when exposed to environmental levels ranging from a few ng L−1 to tens of μg L−1 in surface water. Until now, its detection essentially depends on conventional techniques, such HPLC and GC/MS. Although these analytic techniques are very robust, they are expensive, require experts, and are not portable. Electrochemical sensors are an attractive alternative. They provide many benefits over thermal, optical, and piezoelectric detection including ease of use, rapidity, cost-effectiveness, high sensitivity and selectivity, ease of miniaturization and robustness.

This has attracted a growing amount of research to develop advanced biofuels that have similar physical, chemical, and combustion properties with petroleum-derived fossil fuels. Early generations of biofuels, such as ethanol, butanol, and straight-chain fatty acid-derived esters or hydrocarbons suffer from various undesirable properties and can only be blended in limited amounts. Recent research has shifted to the production of branched-chain biofuels that, compared to straight-chain fuels, have higher octane values, better cold flow, and lower cloud points, making them more suitable for existing engines, particularly for diesel and jet engines. This review focuses on several types of branched-chain biofuels and their immediate precursors, including branched short-chain (C4-C8) and long-chain (C15-C19)-alcohols, alkanes, and esters.

Only a small number of molecular studies have been carried out for the characterization of the underlying genetic defects in these cases. Purpose: Reporting the first family from the Arabian Gulf region with multiple members affected by meningococcemia and abscent serum complement 5 (C5). We tried to correlate clinical, biochemical and molecular genetics features of this family. Methods: Determination of the serum level of all complement proteins including the terminal cascade (C5-9), followed by mutation analysis on DNA extracted from fresh blood samples of each alive family member. Results: Molecular studies showed a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 1, with the change of cytosine to thymine at position 55 (55C > T) leading to change of the glutamine amino acid at position 19 to a stop codon (Q19X), and serologically absence of C5 in the serum.

Due to high activity and long catalyst life, cobalt-based catalyst is currently the catalyst of choice for gas to liquid (GTL) technology. Water is most undesirable byproduct of FTS process. Due to low water-gas-shift (WGS) activity of cobalt-based catalyst, the water concentration rises with time-on-stream (TOS) in FTS. This paper reviews the effects of water on the performances of various cobalt catalysts for FTS. The effects of water on FTS is quite complex and depends on the support and its nature, Co metal loading, its promotion with noble metals, and preparation procedure. Added water up to certain concentrations has positive effects (in terms of higher CO conversion, C5+ selectivity, olefin selectivity and lower methane and CO2 selectivity) on unsupported cobalt oxide catalysts. If the effects of support are taken into account, water has positive effect for silica-supported catalysts. The effects are negative for alumina where as for titania support, water has little positive effect. However in general, oxidation of cobalt active site depending on the cluster size and water partial pressure, the removal of transport restrictions via the formation of water-rich intra-pellet liquids, and kinetic effects have been considered as the main responsible factors. The effects are strongly influenced by the cobalt cluster size as well as on pore size of the support. Addition of noble metals at low cobalt loading increases the dispersion of cobalt on the support and hence improves its activity. Higher cobalt dispersion enhances the negative impact of water especially at higher water partial pressures under FTS conditions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), antibiotics, and hormones that are used in great demand for health and cosmetic purposes have rapidly culminated in the emergence of environmental pollutants. EPs impact the environment in a variety of ways. EPs originate from animal or human sources, either directly discharged into waterbodies or slowly leached via soils. As a result, water quality will deteriorate, drinking water sources will be contaminated, and health issues will arise. Since drinking water treatment plants rely on water resources, the prevalence of this contamination in aquatic environments, particularly surface water, is a severe problem. The review looks into several related issues on EPs in water environment, including methods in removing EPs. Despite its benefits and downsides, the EPs treatment processes comprise several approaches such as physico-chemical, biological, and advanced oxidation processes. Nonetheless, one of the membrane-based filtration methods, ultrafiltration, is considered as one of the technologies that promises the best micropollutant removal in water. With interesting properties including a moderate operating manner and great selectivity, this treatment approach is more popular than conventional ones. This study presents a comprehensive summary of EP’s existence in the environment, its toxicological consequences on health, and potential removal and treatment strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

Despite the successful applications of FTS as the core technology of coal-to-liquid and gas-to-liquid processes in industry, the product selectivity control of syngas conversion still remains a great challenge, particularly for value-added chemicals such as light olefins. Recent studies show that the catalyst design concept of OXZEO (oxide-zeolite-based composite) enables direct syngas conversion to mixed light olefins with a selectivity reaching 80% and to ethylene with a selectivity of 83% among hydrocarbons. They both well-surpass the limits predicated by the Anderson-Schultz-Flory model via the conventional FTS route (58% and 30%, respectively). Furthermore, this catalyst concept allows one-step synthesis of gasoline-range isoparaffins and aromatic compounds, which is otherwise not possible in conventional FTS. A rapidly growing number of studies demonstrate the versatility of this concept and may form a technology platform for utilization of carbon resources including coal, natural gas, and biomass via syngas to a variety of basic chemicals and fuels. However, the selectivity control mechanism is far from being understood. Therefore, we focus mainly on the catalytic roles of the bifunctionalities of OXZEO while reviewing the development of bifunctional catalysts for selective syngas conversion by taking syngas-to-light olefins as an example. With this, we intend to provide insights into the selectivity control mechanism of the OXZEO concept in order to understand the challenges and prospects for future development of much more active and more selective catalysts. ©",Coal deposits; Coal industry; Ethylene; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Natural gas deposits; Natural gasoline plants; Petroleum prospecting; Synthesis gas; Zeolites; Bi-functional catalysts; Composite catalysts; Gas-to-liquid process; Product selectivities; Selective catalysts; Selectivity control; Technology platforms; Value-added chemicals; Catalyst selectivity

Recent findings The BTB divides the seminiferous epithelium into the basal and the adluminal compartments. The BTB is constituted by coexisting actin-based tight junction, basal ectoplasmic specialization, and gap junction, and also intermediate filament-based desmosome between Sertoli cells near the basement membrane. Junctions at the BTB undergo continuous remodeling to facilitate the transport of preleptotene spermatocytes residing in the basal compartment across the immunological barrier during spermatogenesis. Thus, meiosis I/II and postmeiotic spermatid development take place in the adluminal compartment behind the BTB. BTB remodeling also regulates exchanges of biomolecules between the two compartments. As tight junction, basal ectoplasmic specialization, and gap junction use F-actin for attachment, actin microfilaments rapidly convert between their bundled and unbundled/branched configuration to confer BTB plasticity. The events of actin reorganization are regulated by two major classes of ABPs that convert actin microfilaments between their bundled and branched/unbundled configuration. Summary We provide a model on how ABPs regulate BTB remodeling, shedding new light on unexplained male infertility, such as environmental toxicant-induced reproductive dysfunction since the testis, in particular the BTB, is sensitive to environmental toxicants, such as cadmium, bisphenol A, phthalates, and PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid or perfluorooctane sulfonate).

The cellular fatty acids which are involved in protein acylation are mainly saturated fatty acids. Palmitoylation (S-acylation) corresponds to the reversible attachment of palmitic acid (C16:0) to the side chain of a cysteine residue via a thioester bond. N-terminal myristoylation refers to the covalent attachment of myristic acid (C14:0) by an amide bond to the N-terminal glycine of many eukaryotic and viral proteins. Octanoylation (O-acylation) typically concerns the formation of an ester bond between octanoic acid (caprylic acid, C8:0) and the side chain of a serine residue of the gut and brain peptide ghrelin. An increasing number of proteins (enzymes, receptors, oncogenes, tumor suppressors, proteins involved in signal transduction, eukaryotic and viral structural proteins) have been shown to undergo fatty acid acylation. The acyl moiety can mediate protein subcellular localization, protein-protein interaction or protein-membrane interaction. Therefore, through the covalent modification of proteins, saturated fatty acids exhibit emerging specific and important roles in modulating protein functions. This review provides an overview of the recent findings on the various classes of protein acylation leading to the biological ability of saturated fatty acids to regulate many pathways.

We discuss the pathways and mechanisms governing stem cell plasticity and regulation of the stem cell state, and describe experimental methods for assessment of stem cells.

We also highlight key areas for future research in this area, including defining whether the biological basis for cancer disparities is related to effects of complex exposure mixtures on stem cell biology. © 2019","4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; cadmium; chlorphenotane; chlorpyrifos; chromium; diethylstilbestrol; endocrine disruptor; metal; organochlorine pesticide; perfluoro compound; tobacco smoke; cancer prevention; cancer stem cell; carcinogenesis; cell differentiation; cell plasticity; environmental exposure; epigenetics; genetic regulation; hazard; hepatitis; human; malignant neoplasm; nonhuman; occupational exposure; priority journal; Review; stem cell; Wart virus; wound healing; adverse event; animal; biological model; carcinogenesis; environmental exposure; neoplasm; pathophysiology; physiology; stem cell; Animals; Carcinogenesis; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Models, Biological; Neoplasms; Stem Cells"

The immunotoxicity of these environmental toxicants are well acknowledged and a few studies have focused on the relationship between environmental toxicant exposure and vaccine antibody potency or immunoglobulin (Ig) levels in children. Altered antibody titers or Ig levels in post-vaccination children were correlated with these environmental exposures; however, the effects of environmental toxicants on post-vaccination antibody potency or Ig levels in children have not been summarized. The objectives of this systematic review are therefore 1) to summarize the current studies concerning the associations of early-life exposure to environmental toxicants with vaccine antibody potency or Ig levels in children; and 2) to analyze the possible mechanisms underlying exposure-related alterations of antibody titers or Ig levels against different vaccines. We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database for relevant literature with the key terms and included articles up to September 30, 2020. Based on the eligibility criteria, 28 articles were selected. These studies investigated the associations of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (5 studies), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) (6 studies), other OPs (4 studies), heavy metals (11 studies) and air pollutants, e.g. PM2.5, (3 studies) with the serum-specific antibody concentrations or Ig levels against different vaccines, such as anti-Hib, tetanus, diphtheria toxoid, IgA, IgE, etc. These studies suggest that exposure to these toxicants is generally associated with decreased potency of antibodies produced from childhood immunizations and overall deficiency in vaccines' provided protection. This systematic review provides evidence that exposure-induced changes to humoral immune-related tissue/cells/molecules response to vaccines may play predominant roles in the inverse associations between antibody responsiveness to vaccines and environmental toxicants. This review could thus also help us to conduct better immunization policies for children under environmental toxicant burdens. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Health risks; Heavy metals; Immunization; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Vaccines; Air pollutants; Antibody titers; Child; Children's health; Earliest life; Early-life exposure; Environmental toxicants; Immunoglobulin level; Organics; Systematic Review; Antibodies; diphtheria toxoid; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin E; perfluoro compound; polychlorinated biphenyl; antibody; child health; concentration (composition); immunization; pollution exposure; toxic material; vaccination; antibody titer; child; environmental exposure; exposure; health hazard; human; humoral immunity; immunoglobulin blood level; immunotoxicity; particulate matter 2.5; pollutant; priority journal; Review; vaccination

Patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young due to glucokinase mutations can usually be managed by diet alone, while those affected by HNF-1α and HNF-4α mutations respond well to low doses of sulfonylureas. The identification of mutations in the ATP-dependent potassium channel genes KCNJ11 and ABCC8 as the most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes has improved treatment regimes for affected children.

They occupy the highest trophic positions in their food chains and are documented to bioaccumulate high concentrations of persistent pollutants such as toxic metals and legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs).Whereas raptors played a critical role in developing awareness of and policy for chemical pollution, they have thus far played a much smaller role in current research on contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Given the critical knowledge obtained from monitoring 'legacy contaminants' in raptors, more information on the levels and effects of CECs on raptors is urgently needed. This study critically reviews studies on raptors fromEurope reporting the occurrence of CECs with focus on the investigated species, the sampled matrices, and the bioanalytical methods applied. Based on this, we aimed to identify future needs for monitoring CECs in Europe. Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), novel flame retardants (NFRs), and to a lesser extent UV-filters, neonicotinoids, chlorinated paraffins, parabens and bisphenols have been reported in European raptors. White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), Peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) were the most frequently studied raptor species. Among matrices, eggs, feathers and plasmawere the most widely employed, although the potential role of the preen gland as an excretory organ for CECs has recently been proposed. This review highlights the following research priorities for pollution research on raptors in Europe: 1) studies covering all the main classes of CECs; 2) research in other European regions (mainly East Europe); 3) identification of the most suitable matrices and species for the analysis of different CECs; and 4) the application of alternative sample treatment strategies (e.g. QuEChERS or pressurized liquid extraction) is still limited and conventional solventextraction is the preferred choice.

Recent decades brought in water management an intense progress in Advance Oxidation Processes, based on decomposition of pollutants by free radicals, which can be produced in different ways. This review presents the recent advances in those methods for decomposition of the most commonly occurring PFCs in the natural environment – perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS).

Functionalization of microporous polymers via molecule engineering is an effective way to enhance their gas separation performance and processability. This review outlines the research progress of ionization to improve the gas separation performance of typical microporous polymers (e.g., polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIM), perfluorinated polymers, microporous polyimides, etc.) and summarizes the different ionization methods, including carboxylation, sulfonation, quaternization, and other ionization processes. Additionally, the review also explores the research progress of ionization to regulate the processability, microporosity, and gas separation properties of microporous polymers. Specifically, ionization can effectively tailor the microporosity, improve the solubility coefficients of gas molecules, especially CO2, and enhance gas selectivities. In addition, ionization can improve the processability of PIMs and enhance the membrane plasticization resistance.

The shortage of new antimicrobial agents has led to the re-evaluation of old antibiotics such as fosfomycin as a potential regimen for treating multidrug-resistant bacteria especially extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Fosfomycin is a broad-spectrum bactericidal antibiotic that inhibits the initial step of the cell wall biosynthesis. Fosfomycin resistance can occur due to mutation in the drug uptake system or by the acquisition of fosfomycin-modifying enzymes. In this review, we focus on mobile fosfomycin-resistant genes encoding glutathione-S-transferase which are mainly responsible for fosfomycin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, that is, fosA and its subtypes, fosC2, and the recently described fosL1-L2. We summarized the proposed origins of the different resistance determinants and highlighted the different plasmid types which are attributed to the dissemination of fosfomycin-modifying enzymes. Thereby, IncF and IncN plasmids play a predominant role. The detection of mobile fosfomycin-resistant genes in Enterobacteriaceae has increased in recent years. Similar to the situation in (East) Asia, the most frequently detected fosfomycin-resistant gene in Europe is fosA3. Mobile fosfomycin-resistant genes have been detected in isolates of human, animal, food, and environmental origin which leads to a growing concern regarding the risk of spread of such bacteria, especially Escherichia coli and Salmonella, at the human–animal–environment interface. © 2020 The Authors.

Identifying the source responsible for a pollution hot spot is vital for assessing remediation measures, however, as there are many possible sources of environmental PFAS pollution, this can be challenging. Chemical fingerprinting has been proposed as an approach to identify contamination sources. Here, concentrations and profiles (relative distribution profiles) of routinely targeted PFAS in freshwater fish from eight sites in Norway, representing three different sources: (1) production of paper products, (2) the use of aqueous film forming foams (AFFF), and (3) long-range atmospheric transport, were investigated. The data were retrieved from published studies. Results showed that fingerprinting of PFAS in fish can be used to identify the dominant exposure source(s), and the profiles associated with the different sources were described in detail. Based on the results, the liver was concluded to be better suited for source tracking compared to muscle. PFAS fingerprints originating from AFFF were dominated by perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and other perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids (PFSA). Fingerprints originating from both long-range atmospheric transport and production of paper products were associated with high percentages of long chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA). However, there were differences between the two latter sources with respect to the ∑PFAS concentrations and ratios of specific PFCA pairs (PFUnDA/PFDA and PFTrDA/PFDoDA). Low ∑PFAS concentrations were detected in fish exposed mainly to PFAS via long-range atmospheric transport. In contrast, ∑PFAS concentrations were high and high percentages of PFOS were detected in fish exposed to pollution from production of paper products. The source-specific fingerprints described here can be used for source tracking.

The hypothesis most widely accepted is that exposure to insults inducing adverse conditions in-utero may have negative effects on the development of target organs, disrupting homeostasis and increasing the risk of diseases at adulthood. Several models have been proposed to investigate the fetal origins of adult diseases, but although these approaches hold true for almost all diseases, particular attention has been focused on disorders related to the central nervous system, since the brain is particularly sensitive to alterations of the microenvironment during early development. Neurobiological disorders can be broadly divided into developmental, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Even though most of these diseases share genetic risk factors, the onset of the disorders cannot be explained solely by inheritance. Therefore, current understanding presumes that the interactions of environmental input, may lead to different disorders. Among the insults that can play a direct or indirect role in the development of neurobiological disorders are stress, infections, drug abuse, and environmental contaminants.

RECENT FINDINGS: Advances in the manufacture of highly biocompatible alloplastic materials offer an alternative to traditional autologous implants for orbital fracture repair. The emergence of the composite implant offers the stability and strength of traditional titanium mesh, while the porous polyethylene shell allows for greater fibrovascular integration and a potential for decreased risk of postoperative complications. Development of copolymers and biomechanical constructs for the delivery of bone stimulating proteins and stem cells serve to restore orbital volume after fracture repair through stimulation of the patient's own tissue. These recent developments are promising; however, their safety and efficacy have not been verified in humans.

Utilizing photonic advantage for astronomical spectroscopy is a promising approach to miniaturizing the next generation of spectrometers for large telescopes. It can be primarily attained by leveraging the two-dimensional nature of photonic structures on a chip or a set of fibers, thus reducing the size of spectroscopic instrumentation to a few centimeters and the weight to a few hundred grams. A wide variety of astrophotonic spectrometers is currently being developed, including arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs), photonic echelle gratings (PEGs), and Fourier-transform spectrometer (FTS). These astrophotonic devices are flexible, cheaper to mass produce, easier to control, and much less susceptible to vibrations and flexure than conventional astronomical spectrographs. The applications of these spectrographs range from astronomy to biomedical analysis. This paper provides a brief review of this new class of astronomical spectrographs. © 2019 by the authors.",NA

Yet, the contribution of suspended particles has not been systematically reviewed. Analyzing reported studies, we quantitatively demonstrate that suspended particles in surface water can contain significantly higher concentrations of PFAAs than the sediment below, indicating the source of suspended particles are not the sediment but particles eroded and carried from the source zone upstream. The affinity of PFAAs to particles depends on the particle composition, including organic carbon fraction and iron or aluminum oxide content. In soils, most PFAAs are retained within the top 5 m below the ground surface. The distribution of PFAAs in the subsurface varies based on site properties and local weather conditions. The depth corresponding to the maximum concentration of PFAA in soil decreases with an increase in soil organic carbon or rainfall amount received in the catchment areas. We attribute a greater accumulation of PFAAs near the upper layer of the subsurface to an increase in the accumulation of particles eroded from source zones upstream receiving heavy rainfall. Precursor transformation in the aerobic zone is significantly higher than in the anaerobic zone, thereby making the aerobic subsurface zone serve as a long-term source of groundwater pollution. Collectively, these results suggest that suspended particles, often an overlooked vector for PFAAs, can be a dominant pathway for the transport of PFAAs in environments. © 2021 The Authors","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Catchments; Colloids; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Iron oxides; Rain; River pollution; Soil pollution; Soils; Surface waters; Suspended sediments; Perfluoroalkyl acids; PFAS transport; Rainfall intensity; Soil organic carbon; Source zone; Subsurface leaching; Subsurface soil; Surface runoffs; Suspended particles; Transport pathways; Organic carbon; ground water; iron oxide; organic carbon; rain; surface water; carbon; fluorocarbon; ground water; aluminum oxide; chemical compound; concentration (composition); pollutant transport; runoff; soil pollution; surface water; suspended particulate matter; catchment area; colloid; controlled study; maximum concentration; mineralogy; particle resuspension; Review; runoff; soil; surface runoff; weathering; environmental monitoring; soil; water pollutant; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Groundwater; Soil; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Environmental persistent free radicals are found to exist in a variety of environmental media, such as combustion particles and organic contaminated soil, and they are considered to be an emerging pollutant recently. Compared with transient free radicals, environmental persistent free radicals have received relatively less attention, and the generating mechanisms and environmental impacts remain unclear. Meanwhile, environmental persistent free radicals are widely distributed in the environment, which makes them more complex in their research. This review highlights EPFRs from the following aspects: detection methods, generating mechanisms, speciation types, environmental characteristics (persistence, stability, and reactivity), the harm to the environment and the elimination method. By studying the fate behaviors of environmental persistent free radicals, this article proposes a possible migration pathway in environment. The purpose of this review is to have a more comprehensive understanding of the EPFRs, especially to help reduce the harm to the human and environment, and provide scientific basis for researchers to have a deeper study on it. © 2017, Editorial Office of Progress in Chemistry.

The first part is devoted to hereditary angioedema, in which acute, sometimes life-threatening recurrent attacks of acute swelling, usually associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, occur. It is related to a structural or functional deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor. Patients usually have lowered C4 levels, and diagnosis relies on determination of antigenic and/or functional C1 inhibitor level. The second part focuses on lupus erythematosus, as deficiencies in early components of the complement system, such as C1q, C1r, C1s, C2 or C4, are the strongest known disease susceptibility genes for the development of human systemic lupus erythematosus. Severe infections early in life and marked photosensitivity in a patient with lupus erythematosus are clues to an underlying complement deficiency. The genetic background and the clinical associations of the different components of the complement system will be detailed. © The Author(s), 2010.","complement component C1q; complement component C1r; complement component C1s; complement component C1s inhibitor; complement component C2; complement component C3; complement component C4; complement component C4a; complement component C4b; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; angioneurotic edema; complement deficiency; complement system; disease association; disease severity; gastrointestinal symptom; genetic susceptibility; human; infection; photosensitivity; priority journal; recurrent disease; review; skin lupus erythematosus; skin manifestation; swelling; systemic lupus erythematosus; Complement C1; Complement C2; Complement C4; Complement System Proteins; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Photosensitivity Disorders; Skin Diseases"

Organ metabolism depends on oxygen to produce adenosine triphosphate and temperatures below 37◦C reduce the metabolic rate and oxygen requirements. The transport and delivery of oxygen in machine perfusion are key determinants in preserving organ viability and cellular function. Oxygen delivery is more challenging than carbon dioxide removal, and oxygenation of the perfusion fluid is temperature dependent. The maximal oxygen content of water-based solutions is inversely related to the temperature, while cellular oxygen demand correlates positively with temperature. Machine perfusion above 20◦C will therefore require an oxygen carrier to enable sufficient oxygen delivery to the liver. Human red blood cells are the most physiological oxygen carriers. Alternative artificial oxygen transporters are hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers, perfluorocarbons, and an extracellular oxygen carrier derived from a marine invertebrate. We describe the principles of oxygen transport, delivery, and consumption in machine perfusion for donor livers using different oxygen carrier-based perfusion solutions and we discuss the properties, advantages, and disadvantages of these carriers and their use. © 2020 by the authors.

Studies in animal I/R models, including intestinal, hindlimb, kidney, and myocardial I/R models, have established a key role of the complement system in mediation of I/R injury using complement inhibitors and knock-out animal models. As complement activation has been shown to be an early event in I/R injury, inhibiting its activation or its components may offer tissue protection after reperfusion. However, clinical study results using complement inhibitors have largely been disappointing. Therefore, identification of a more specific pathogenic target for therapeutic intervention seems to be warranted. For this purpose more detailed knowledge of the responsible pathway of complement activation in I/R injury is required. Recent evidence from in vitro and in vivo models suggests involvement of both the classic and the lectin pathways in I/R injury via exposition of neo-epitopes in ischemic membranes. However, most of these findings have been obtained in knock-out murine models and have for a large part remained unconfirmed in the human setting. The observation that the relative role of each pathway seems to differ among organs complicates matters further. Whether a defective complement system protects from I/R injury in humans remains largely unknown. Most importantly, involvement of mannose-binding lectin as the main initiator of the lectin pathway has not been demonstrated at tissue level in human I/R injury to date. Thus, conclusions drawn from animal I/R studies should be extrapolated to the human setting with caution.

A chapter emphasizes the role of six well-known allergen families involved in PFAS: PR10 proteins, profilins, lipid transfer proteins, thaumatin-like proteins, isoflavone reductases, and β-1,3 glucanases. The relevance in PFAS of three supplementary allergen families is presented: oleosins, polygalacturonases, and gibberellin-regulated proteins. To support the discussion a few original relevant results were added.

A mechanism for the organ-specific toxicity of these compounds to the kidney has been elucidated. The mechanism involves hepatic glutathione conjugation to dihaloalkenyl or 1,1-difluoroalkyl glutathione S-conjugates, which are cleaved by γ-glutamyltransferase and dipeptidases to cysteine S-conjugates. Haloalkene-derived cysteine S-conjugates may have four fates in the organism: (a) They may be substrates for renal cysteine conjugate β-lyases, which cleave them to form reactive intermediates identified as thioketenes (chloroalkene-derived S-conjugates), thionoacyl halides (fluoroalkene- derived S-conjugates not containing bromide), thuranes, and thiolactones (fluoroalkene-derived S-conjugates containing bromine); (b) cysteine S- conjugates may be N-acetylated to excretable mercapturic acids; (c) they may undergo transamination or oxidation to the corresponding 3-mercaptopyruvic acid S-conjugate; (d) finally, oxidation of the sulfur atom in halovinyl cysteine S-conjugates and corresponding mercapturic acids forms Michael acceptors and may also represent a bioactivation reaction. The formation of reactive intermediates by cysteine conjugate β-lyase may play a role in the target-organ toxicity and in the possible renal tumorigenicity of several chlorinated olefins widely used in many chemical processes.",acetylcysteine; glutathione; glutathione transferase; haloolefin; chlorination; cytotoxicity; drug activation; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; halogenation; multigene family; nephrotoxicity; nonhuman; oxidation; priority journal; review; transamination; Rodentia

Among different energy resources, fossil fuels meet more than 80 % of the energy demand. The factors such as the depletion of fossil fuel reserves, the unstable price of fossil fuels, and the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) due to the burning of fuels draw researchers’ attention towards the development of renewable and sustainable fuels. In this context, biomass may fill the gap between energy demand and petroleum availability in the foreseeable future. Moreover, half of this bioenergy comes from conventional uses of biomass, primarily in cooking and heating, as well as within small-scale industries (such as charcoal kilns and brick kilns). The Biomass-to-Liquid (BTL) technology using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) and the Methanol process offers advantages over the traditional use of biomass. The FT/Methanol process is a propitious route to produce carbon-neutral, ultra-clean fuels that generate regulated emissions, including NOx, SOx, and PM.

Although it has been known since 1975, the chemistry of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones has recently only received great attention from the scientific community. Generally, they are used as either safe and bench-stable diazo precursors in carbene transfer reactions or as 1,3-dipoles in cycloaddition and cyclization reactions. Notably, fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones to replace toxic fluoroalkyl diazo compounds in carbene transfer reactions reduce the risk of rapid accumulation of explosive diazo compounds and improve functional group compatibility and substrate scope. Given the growing importance of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones in chemical synthesis, a comprehensive review of this topic in the literature is essential to demonstrate their synthetic potential. In this review, we critically summarize and comprehensively analyze the publications in various literatures on the chemistry of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones starting from 1990 to date. The classification of the different reactivity profiles of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones and the efficiencies of similar types of reactions or substrates with fluoroalkyl diazo compounds are compared.

They are anchored to the inner surface of the cell membrane where receptor-mediated signalling induces Ras activation (GDP/GTP exchange) and inactivation (stimulation of Ras GTPase activity). Ras-GTP in turn activates a multitude of signalling cascades controlling cell growth and differentiation. Aberrant Ras function (mostly constitutive activation) contributes to the development of many types of neoplastic human diseases. Activating mutations in ras genes, leading to the expression of Ras proteins insensitive to Ras-GTPase activating proteins, are found in as many as 30% of all human tumours. This suggests that Ras is an appropriate target for drug design. Remarkable improvements in the understanding of post-translational modifications in Ras that promote Ras-membrane anchorage. in the mechanisms of activation and inactivation of Ras, and in the interactions of Ras with a plethora of effector molecules have led to the development of new concepts for Ras-directed therapy. The most advanced approach has been that of farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) designed to inhibit the farnesylation of Ras required for membrane anchorage and transforming activity. FTIs now in clinical trials have been extensively reviewed. Here we review the progress in the development of FTIs and in the development of other promising concepts for Ras-directed therapy. These include compounds such as S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS), which disrupt the proper anchorage of Ras with the cell membrane acid inhibit human tumour growth in animal models, and compounds that interfere with interactions of Ras with its downstream effecters. We conclude with a description of a recently described novel drug concept that could restore the defective GTPase activity of oncogenic Ras and with the interesting results of reovirus-induced tumour regression observed in animal models of human rumours containing an intact Ras signalling pathway.",antineoplastic agent; cell membrane protein; cell surface receptor; farnesylthiosalicylic acid; guanosine diphosphate; guanosine triphosphatase; guanosine triphosphate; protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor; Ras protein; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; autoimmune disease; cancer inhibition; carcinogenesis; cell differentiation; cell growth; confocal microscopy; drug design; drug targeting; enzyme activation; gene mutation; human; human cell; melanoma; nonhuman; oncogene ras; pancreas tumor; protein processing; review; tumor regression

In TNDM, growth-retarded infants develop diabetes in the first few weeks of life, only to go into remission after a few months with possible relapse to permanent diabetes usually around adolescence or in adulthood. In PNDM, insulin secretory failure occurs in the late fetal or early postnatal period. The very recently elucidated mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes, encoding the Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits of the pancreatic KATP channel involved in regulation of insulin secretion, account for a third to a half of the PNDM cases. Molecular analysis of chromosome 6 anomalies and the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes encoding Kir6.2 and SUR1 provides a tool for distinguishing transient from permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus in the neonatal period.

Thermal gasification of biomass represents a convenient route to produce syn-gas from intractable materials particularly those derived from waste that are not cost effective to process for use in biocatalytic or other milder catalytic processes. The development of novel catalysts with high activity and selectivity is desirable as it leads to improved quality and value of FTS products.

We recently established a new islet isolation protocol, called the Kyoto Islet Isolation Method, based on the Ricordi method. It includes an in-situ cooling system for pancreas procurement, pancreatic ductal protection, a modified two-layer (M-Kyoto/perfluorochemical [PFC]) method of pancreas preservation, and a new islet purification solution (Iodixanol-based solution). Using this islet isolation method, we isolated islets from 19 human pancreata of non-heart-beating donors and transplanted 16 preparations into seven patients with type 1 diabetes between April 7, 2004 and November 18, 2005. The percentage of those meeting the release criteria of the Edmonton Protocol was more than 80%. We also performed living-donor transplantation of islets for unstable diabetes on January 19, 2005. Establishment of this method enables us to make diabetic patients insulin-independent, using islets not only from two or three pancreata of non-heart-beating donors but also using islets from half a pancreas from a living donor. © Springer Japan 2008.","basiliximab; enzyme; hemoglobin A1c; iodixanol; Liberase; mmf; mycophenolic acid 2 morpholinoethyl ester; perfluoro compound; rapamycin; tacrolimus; ulinastatin; University of Wisconsin solution; balloon catheter; cadaver donor; cell isolation; clinical protocol; cooling; graft preservation; hemoglobin blood level; human; immunosuppressive treatment; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Japan; kidney pancreas transplantation; living donor; methodology; nonhuman; organ preservation; pancreas islet; pancreas islet transplantation; purification; review; treatment outcome; vein catheterization; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Humans; Islets of Langerhans Transplantation; Japan; Living Donors; Organ Preservation; Tissue and Organ Procurement"

The treatment possibilities search for methods to restore and bring back the function of injured joint surfaces. Recent trend heads for creation of biocompatible matrices (scaffolds) based on natural and synthetic polimers. This study presents currently used biomaterials in the sphere of their usefulness in articular cartilage lesions repair. Both natural and synthetic materials have been researched in experimental and clinical studies. Naturally- derived protein polymers, such as collagen, fibrin, gelatin and carbohydrate polymers containing polylactide and polyglycolic acid, hialuronan, agarose, alginate, chitosan can be distinguished. Synthetic materials are represented by carbon fibers, Dacron and Teflon matrices. Scaffolds fabrication techniques include fiber-bonding, particulate leaching, freeze- drying and particles aggregation. Due to different polymers' properties selection of a scaffold depends on an appropriate matrix parameters. The most valuable characteristics are biocompatibility, porosity, mechanical resistance and bioabsorbability. Notwithstanding, several experimental and clinical studies there still exists the need for one simple and inexpensive polymer- based method that would bring satisfactory results in the area of joint cartilage repair.","biomaterial; polymer; articular cartilage; bone prosthesis; ceramics; classification; culture technique; growth, development and aging; human; methodology; physiology; regeneration; review; tissue engineering; Bone Substitutes; Cartilage, Articular; Cell Culture Techniques; Ceramics; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Humans; Polymers; Regeneration; Tissue Engineering"

Their widespread uses and strong persistence in the environment have led to inevitable exposure for humans. They accumulate in mothers and then are transferred to infants through placenta and breastfeeding, causing diverse potential health risks. Based on more than 100 articles published from 2000 to date, this review summarizes current knowledge on prenatal and postnatal transfer of PFASs from mothers to fetuses/infants. Transplacental transfer efficiencies (RCM) differ among individual PFASs, depending on the alkyl chain length, the function groups, and the branching position in the molecule, and showing enantioselectivity for chiral 1 m-PFOS. Transfer efficiency from serum to breast milk (TEBS/MS) is lower than RCM, but PFAS exposure of infants through breastfeeding in the first month was assessed to be greater than that through transplacental transfer during the entire gestation period. Based on the latest promulgated reference doses, infants would face potential health risks. To our knowledge, this is the first review on the prenatal and postnatal mother-to-offspring transfer of PFASs at congeneric, isomeric, and enantiomeric levels. It provides a better understanding of the critical environmental health issue of PFASs in fetuses and infants, which deserves greater attention throughout society. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Efficiency; Health; Stereochemistry; Alkyl chain lengths; Environmental health; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Potential health risks; Reference dose; Transfer efficiency; Transplacental transfers; Health risks; breastfeeding; health risk; maternal health; persistence; pregnancy; risk factor; serum; article; attention; breast feeding; breast milk; chirality; enantioselectivity; environmental health; female; fetus; gestation period; health hazard; human; human tissue; infant; isomerization; placental transfer; progeny

The major function of CD59 is to protect cells from complement attack. CD59 binds to complement components C8 and C9 and prevents the polymerization of C9, which is required for the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). Other functions of CD59 in cellular immunity are less well defined. CD59 is inserted into the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. A defect of this anchor causes lack of this protein from the cell membrane, which leads to an enhanced sensitivity towards complement attack. Patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) harbor a varying percentage of red blood cell clones with a defect in GPI-anchored proteins, including CD59. The most characteristic symptoms of this disease are episodes of hemolysis and thromboses. Although CD59 has been classified as a membrane protein for more than 25 years, an alloantibody directed against CD59 was found only recently. So far, the first and sole alloantibody described was detected in a CD59-deficient child. In 2014, CD59 received the status of a blood group system by the International Society for Blood Transfusion Red Cell Immunogenetics and Blood Group Terminology Working Party. Among a variety of almost 20 synonyms, the designation CD59 was chosen for the blood group system and CD59.1 for the wild-type protein. The only three alleles published to date are null alleles. All CD59-deficient individuals recognized so far were severely ill, two of whom have died. Most of the reported cases present with a typical clinical picture within the first year of life that includes neuropathy, strokes, and mild Coombs-negative hemolysis. In one published case, the application of the complement inhibitor eculizumab caused a pronounced improvement of the clinical situation.","alloantibody; CD59 antigen; complement inhibitor; eculizumab; glycosylphosphatidylinositol; blood group antigen; CD59 antigen; complement inhibitor; lymphocyte antibody; 5' untranslated region; alternative RNA splicing; blood group system; carboxy terminal sequence; cellular immunity; human; molecular weight; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; null allele; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; phenotype; polymerization; priority journal; Review; X ray crystallography; chemistry; immunology; biochemical analysis; history of medicine; inheritance; nomenclature; Antigens, CD59; Blood Group Antigens; Complement Inactivating Agents; Humans"

NA,Association between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus,2022,NA,NA,"Background: Existing evidence suggests that perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exposure might contribute to the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis to identify the association between PFAS and the risk of GDM. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for appropriate articles about the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of GDM before September 28, 2020. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized by Stata 16.0 through fixed effect models according to heterogeneity. We also carried out subgroup analyses by geographic location, blood sampling time of subjects, method of chemical analysis, study design, sample size, and sampling year. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the robustness of the results. Results: A total of eight studies involving 5654 pregnant women were included in the meta-analysis. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was positively and significantly associated with the risk of GDM (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02–1.59). Exposure to other types of PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of GDM with the pooled effect estimates of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86–1.09), 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86–1.24), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55–1.16) respectively. Conclusion: We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and GDM and found that PFOA concentration was significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of GDM in public health. Further studies are needed in order to establish causality and clarify the potential mechanism. © 2021",NA

Development of VW-resistant cultivars remains the only economic option for controlling the disease. The objective of this review was to summarize the progress in screening methods, resistance sources, and genetics, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, markerassisted selection (MAS) and breeding for VW resistance in cotton. Even though Gossypium barbadense L. carries high levels of resistance, its resistance has not been transferred into commercial Upland cultivars. Many Acala cotton cultivars developed in New Mexico and California between the 1940s and the 1990s, and some commercial transgenic cultivars are tolerant or moderately resistant to VW. However, due to difficulties in achieving consistent and uniform inoculation and infection with V. dahliae, both qualitative and quantitative inheritance of VW resistance have been reported in numerous studies for resistant G. barbadense and Upland genotypes. Several QTL analyses have shown the existence of VW resistance QTLs on almost all the tetraploid cotton chromosomes; however, QTLs have most frequently been detected on c5, c7, c8, c11, c16, c17, c19, c21, c23, c24, and c26. This has led to MAS for progeny with favorable QTL alleles for VW resistance in several experiments. Phenotypic selection for VW resistance has been inefficient, while the effectiveness and efficiency of MAS remain to be validated. There is an urgent need for the development of better plant inoculation and screening methods, and for more molecular mapping studies to discern the genetic basis of VW resistance in cotton. © Crop Science Society of America.",NA

Electron beam (EB) is a common type of irradiation used in wastewater treatment, as it has the ability to create free radicals to break down chemical bonds, which is beneficial for treating modern wastewater complex matrix. As a result, many systems have been developed that make EB cheaper and easier to scale up. This paper reviews the application of EB in wastewater treatment along with many factors (especially scavengers) attributing to the effectiveness of this treatment. It has been proven that EB is used in a variety of ways and is ultimately effective in wastewater treatments. However, in order to achieve high efficiency, EB has been utilized in a relatively high dose, which results from the competition between scavengers and target compounds and the complex structure of many organic compounds. Also, the subordinate radical forming also plays an important role in the pollutants degradation by using EB when there is still a limitation in this field. It is important to perform more research on scavengers and secondary radicals in order to overcome the limitation of EB and make it become state-of-the-art technology. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Bond strength (chemical); Electron beams; Free radicals; Pollution; Reclamation; Chemical complexity; Complex matrices; Complex structure; Conventional methods; Emerging pollutants; High-efficiency; State-of-the-art technology; Wastewater treatment technologies; Wastewater treatment; concentration (composition); electron; irradiation; radical; wastewater treatment; Lethrinidae

Lancet (2016); 388: 3027–35 and Callaghan et al. Pediatrics (2006);118: 1566–73. Despite advances in prenatal care, prematurity remains a persistent clinical problem, with 1 in 8 births occurring prematurely (prior to 37 weeks of gestation) in the USA as discussed by Frey and Klebanoff Semin Fetal Neonatal Med (2016);21: 68–73,. Advances in neonatology including gentle ventilation strategies, permissive hypercapnia, and the use of corticosteroids have led to substantial improvements in survival; however, long-term survivors of preterm birth face considerable morbidities affecting every major organ system. Chronic lung disease represents one of the most common and significant long-term complications of preterm birth and is attributable largely to iatrogenic injury due to the underdeveloped nature of the alveoli and lack of compliance of the immature lung as stated by Behrman and Butler (2007). Conventional gas-based ventilation of the premature lung leads to barotrauma, inflammation, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) as discussed by Sinha and Donn Semin Fetal Neonatal Med (2006);11: 166–73. Recent Findings: Since the discovery of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) over 70 years ago, liquid ventilation has been examined as a viable alternative to conventional gas-based mechanical ventilation in a variety of disease models, including that of extreme prematurity. PFCs are biologically inert organofluorine compounds with remarkably high gas dissolving properties due to weak intermolecular attractive forces, allowing dissolution of up to twenty times the amount of oxygen and three times the amount of carbon dioxide than water as discussed by Wesseler, Iltis, and Clark J Fluor Chem. Elsevier Sequoia S.A (1977);9: 137–46. These compounds have low surface tension, have low viscosity, are relatively dense, and have low vapor pressure (11–85 torr), permitting rapid evaporation from the lungs. One perfluorocarbon liquid of particular clinical interest is perflubron, a PFC with a bromine substituted for a primary fluorine. This compound has been used as a contrast medium and is radiographically opaque, allowing clinicians to examine lung filling in real time according to the study of Kazerooni et al. Radiology (1962);198: 137–42. Initial studies of liquid ventilation have shown increased gas exchange and alveoli recruitment, in addition to the return to fluid-filled physiology similar to that experienced during gestation, as discussed by Kylstram et al. Trans Am SOC Artif Intern Organs (1962;8: 378–83, Clark and Gollan (1966), and Schoenfisch Anid and Kylstra J Appl Physiol (1973);35: 117–21, leading to the identification of liquid ventilation as a promising intervention to support critically preterm infants. Summary: This review will summarize the history of clinical and translational research studies of liquid ventilation, with a focus on studies targeting prematurity, and will explore the areas requiring further study prior to widespread clinical implementation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",cobrotoxin; contrast medium; corticosteroid; fluorocarbon; interleukin 1; interleukin 6; myeloperoxidase; organofluorine derivative; perfluorooctyl bromide; acute lung injury; adult respiratory distress syndrome; air interface; attractive force; cardiopulmonary function; comparative study; evaporation; extracorporeal circulation; functional residual capacity; hemodynamics; human; hypercapnia; hypothermia; iatrogenic disease; intervention study; liquid ventilation; lung alveolus surface tension; lung barotrauma; lung compliance; lung dysplasia; lung function; lung lavage; meconium aspiration; neonatology; neutrophil; positive end expiratory pressure ventilation; prematurity; respiratory distress; Review; surface tension; tidal volume; vapor pressure; ventilatory pressure; viscosity
NA,EDC-induced mechanisms of immunotoxicity: a systematic review,2021,NA,NA,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) refer to a group of chemicals that cause adverse effects in human health, impairing hormone production and regulation, resulting in alteration of homeostasis, reproductive, and developmental, and immune system impairments. The immunotoxicity of EDCs involves many mechanisms altering gene expression that depend on the activation of nuclear receptors such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the estrogen receptor (ER), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which also results in skin and intestinal disorders, microbiota alterations and inflammatory diseases. This systematic review aims to review different mechanisms of immunotoxicity and immunomodulation of T cells, focusing on T regulatory (Treg) and Th17 subsets, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) caused by specific EDCs such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), bisphenols (BPs) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). To achieve this objective, a systematic study was conducted searching various databases including PubMed and Scopus to find in-vitro, in-vivo, and biomonitoring studies that examine EDC-dependent mechanisms of immunotoxicity. While doing the systematic review, we found species- and cell-specific outcomes and a translational gap between in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. Finally, an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework is proposed, which explains mechanistically toxicity endpoints emerging from different EDCs having similar key events and can help to improve our understanding of EDCs mechanisms of immunotoxicity. In conclusion, this review provides insights into the mechanisms of immunotoxicity mediated by EDCs and will help to improve human health risk assessment. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",NA

This study develops a semi-quantitative assessment methodology for selecting appropriate sludge treatment options on the basis of a lifecycle assessment approach. Various biological, chemical, thermal, and thermo-chemical sludge treatment methods described in the literature are reviewed and evaluated holistically by adopting the developed methodology to determine their comparative effectiveness in reducing sludge volume/weight and environmental impacts. Anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, and supercritical water oxidation are found to be the best-performing treatment methods. They are not only more effective in reducing sludge volume/weight and pollutants but also have lower global warming and toxicity potential compared to most of the other methods reviewed. The potential for adverse environmental effects remains owing to the release of pollutants when the products of sludge treatment are utilised, e.g. as soil amendments or fuel. This necessitates further investigation to explore the toxicity impacts of a wider array of emerging pollutants from a lifecycle perspective as well as further development of sludge treatment methods to overcome the drawbacks of existing methods. © 2019 The Authors",Anaerobic digestion; Decision making; Global warming; Life cycle; Pollution; Sewage sludge; Soils; Toxicity; Comparative effectiveness; Environmental pollutants; Life-cycle assessments; Quantitative assessments; Reducing sludge volume; Sewage sludge treatment; Supercritical water oxidation; Toxicity potential; Sludge disposal

PFCs and their emulsions can facilitate respiratory-gas delivery to both procaryotic and eucaryotic cells in culture, including those in bioreactor systems. Such gaseous enhancement often stimulates biomass production, yields of commercially-important cellular products and, for plant systems, the expression of totipotency. The recoverability, and hence recycleability, of otherwise expensive PFCs from aqueous culture medium makes their routine use commercially feasible. This paper gives an overview of the applications and benefits of using PFCs in microbial, animal and plant cell cultures, including both aerobic and anaerobic systems. The synergistic beneficial effects of PFC-facilitated gas supply and the cell protecting/growth-enhancing effects of non-ionic surfactant culture medium supplements in some systems are emphasised. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Soon after the mutated gene was identified in 1989, investigators demonstrated that transfer of a normal copy of the CF gene corrected ion transport abnormalities, thus validating the potential for use of gene therapy for this autosomal recessive disease. However, subsequent studies in a variety of in vitro and animal models, and more limited human studies, have revealed several obstacles to gene therapy for CF: (1) The incomplete understanding of CF lung disease pathogenesis, particularly the relative importance of ion transport and other cellular abnormalities (including glycoconjugate processing, pH regulation of intracellular organelles, and membrane trafficking), and of surface epithelial versus submucosal gland CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) expression, generates uncertainty as to the necessary target cells for gene transfer and the optimum end point(s) for short-term human studies. (2) The airway epithelium has protective barriers against viral infection that impair gene transfer with several vectors, including recombinant viruses and DNA conjugates. Improvement in DNA transfer technology will be necessary for successful gene therapy. (3) Immune responses to recombinant viruses and inflammatory effects of bacterial DNA are only partially understood and appear to limit efficacy, particularly with repeated administration.

Firstly, it was determined that the kidneys produce urine containing toxic substances that accumulate in the body if the kidneys fail to function properly; secondly, it was necessary to discover the process of diffusion and dialysis; thirdly, it was necessary to develop a safe method to prevent clotting in the extracorporeal circulation; and fourthly, it was necessary to develop biocompatible dialyzing membranes. Most of the essential knowledge was acquired by the end of the 19th century. Hemodialysis as a practical means of replacing kidney function started and developed in the 20th century. The original hemodialyzers, using celloidin as a dialyzing membrane and hirudin as an anticoagulant, were used in animal experiments at the beginning of the 20th century, and then there were a few attempts in humans in the 1920s. Rapid progress started with the application of cellophane membranes and heparin as an anticoagulant in the late 1930s and 1940s. The explosion of new dialyzer designs continued in the 1950s and 1960s and ended with the development of capillary dialyzers. Cellophane was replaced by other dialyzing membranes in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Dialysis solution was originally prepared in the tank from water, electrolytes, and glucose. This solution was recirculated through the dialyzer and back to the tank. In the 1960s, a method of single-pass dialysis solution preparation and delivery system was designed. A large quantity of dialysis solution was used for a single dialysis. Sorbent systems, using a small volume of regenerated dialysis solution, were developed in the mid 1960s, and continue to be used for home hemodialysis and acute renal failure. At the end of the 20th century, a new closed system, which prepared and delivered ultrapure dialysis solution preparation, was developed. This system also had automatic reuse of lines and dialyzers and prepared the machine for the next dialysis. This was specifically designed for quotidian home hemodialysis. Another system for frequent home hemodialysis or acute renal failure was developed at the turn of the 21st century. This system used premanufactured dialysis solution, delivered to the home or dialysis unit, as is done for peritoneal dialysis. © Journal compilation © 2008 International Society for Hemodialysis.","cellophane; cuprophane; dialysis fluid; electrolyte; glucose; heparin; hirudin; politef; poly(methyl methacrylate); pyroxylin; uremic toxin; water; acute kidney failure; anticoagulant therapy; artificial kidney; biocompatibility; blood clotting; dialysis membrane; diffusion; drug delivery system; extracorporeal circulation; hemodialysis; history of medicine; home care; human; kidney function; knowledge discovery; nonhuman; patient safety; peritoneal dialysis; recycling; renal replacement therapy; review; ultrafiltration; Equipment Design; Hemodialysis Solutions; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Kidney Failure; Kidney, Artificial; Renal Dialysis"

Minimizing the use of relatively more expensive traditional sorbents in water treatment is a motivating aspect of biochar production, e.g., $246/ton non-activated biochar to $1500/ton activated carbon. Biochar can remove organic contaminants in water, such as some pesticides (0.02-23mgg-1), pharmaceutical and personal care products (0.001-59mgg-1), dyes (2-104mgg-1), humic acid (60mgg-1), perfluorooctane sulfonate (164mgg-1), and N-nitrosomodimethylamine (3mgg-1). Including adsorption/filtration applications, biochar can potentially be used to inactivate Escherichia coli via disinfection, and transform 95% of 2-chlorobiphenyl via advanced oxidation processes. However, more sorption data using biochar especially at demonstration-scale, for treating potable and reuse water in adsorption/filtration applications will help establish the potential of biochars to serve as surrogates for activated carbons. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Activated carbon; Contamination; Escherichia coli; Potable water; Water; Water conservation; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Bio chars; Microbial; Organic contaminant; Organic contaminants in water; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Pharmaceutical and personal care products; Treatment; Activated carbon treatment; 2 chlorobiphenyl; activated carbon; biphenyl; dimethylamine; dye; humic acid; n nitrosomodimethylamine; organic compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; pesticide; sorbent; unclassified drug; 2-chlorobiphenyl; biochar; biphenyl derivative; charcoal; humic substance; water; water pollutant; activated carbon; biofuel; bioremediation; charcoal; organic pollutant; pollution control; water treatment; adsorption; diffusion; disinfection; Escherichia coli; filtration; hydrogen bond; hydrophobicity; microbial contamination; oxidation; Review; static electricity; waste component removal; waste water recycling; water contamination; water treatment; analysis; humic substance; metabolism; microbiology; procedures; water management; water pollutant; Escherichia coli; Adsorption; Biphenyl Compounds; Charcoal; Humic Substances; Water; Water Microbiology; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification"

The objective of our study was to estimate the relationship between dental caries prevalence and exposure to four PFAA: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) in a nationally representative sample of US adolescents. Setting/Design We analysed cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2012 for 12-19-year-old US adolescents. Participants Of 10 856 adolescents aged 12 to 19 years who had a dental examination, we included 2869 with laboratory measurements for serum PFAA concentrations and complete covariate data in our study. Primary and secondary outcome measures Dental caries prevalence was defined as the presence of decay or a restoration on any tooth surface, or the loss of a tooth due to tooth decay. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the covariate-Adjusted association between serum PFAA concentrations and dental caries prevalence, accounting for the complex National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey design. Results Of 2869 adolescents, 59% had one or more dental caries. We observed no associations between the prevalence of dental caries and serum concentrations of PFOA, PFOS or PFHxS. The adjusted odds of caries were 21% (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.01), 15% (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.08) and 30% (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.90) lower among adolescents in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th serum PFNA concentration quartiles compared to adolescents in the first quartile, respectively. The linear trend for this association was not statistically significant. Conclusion PFOA, PFOS and PFHxS were not associated with prevalence of dental caries. The prevalence of caries was reduced with increasing serum PFNA concentrations; however, these results should be interpreted cautiously given that we were unable to adjust for several factors related to oral health. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.",alkyl group; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; cotinine; fluorocarbon; lead; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; sulfonic acid derivative; adolescent; adult; biological activity; child; comparative study; cross-sectional study; dental caries; dental restoration; female; human; laboratory test; major clinical study; male; multivariate logistic regression analysis; prevalence; Review; school child; surface property; trend study; United States; young adult; African American; blood; Caucasian; dental caries; educational status; environmental exposure; Hispanic; income; Mexican American; nutrition; sex ratio; Adolescent; African Americans; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Child; Cotinine; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dental Caries; Educational Status; Environmental Exposure; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Fluorocarbons; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Income; Lead; Male; Mexican Americans; Nutrition Surveys; Prevalence; Sex Distribution; Sulfonic Acids; United States; Young Adult

The electro-generated hydrogen peroxide leads to the improvement in ozone transformation to hydroxyl radical; hence, the electro-peroxone can considerably improve the treatment performance, total organic carbon (TOC) mineralization, and reduction of ozone-resistant emerging pollutants compared with the traditional ozonation process. Moreover, the main disadvantage of the traditional ozonation process for water treatment is bromate generation during the treatment of bromide-containing water sources, which can be remarkably decreased by the application of this technology. Additionally, because of its enhanced kinetics of contaminant degradation, electro-peroxone offers a more secure, time-efficient, energy-saving, and effective alternative for the reduction of emerging pollutants, compared with different ozone-dependent AOPs including traditional UV/O3 and peroxone (O3/H2O2) methods. Hence, it can offer a suitable, eco-friendly, and cost-effective approach to markedly enhance the efficiency of the current ozonation process. This paper reviews the principles of the electro-peroxone process and compares its efficiency with other methods. The essential reaction mechanisms and experimental parameters that are crucial to the operation, realization, and design of the electro-peroxone, including ozone dosage, applied current, injected ozone flowrate, electrolyte type, electrode setup, solution pH, and type of cathode and anode on electro-peroxone efficiency, are investigated. Moreover, the application of electro-peroxone for water and wastewater treatment is explored.

The HBM-I value corresponds to the concentration of a compound in human biological material below which no adverse health effects are expected to occur. Consequently, no action is required when the HBM-I value is not exceeded (HBM-Commission, 1996). In 2016, the HBM Commission developed HBM-I values of 2 ng PFOA/mL and 5 ng PFOS/mL in blood serum or plasma, respectively. A detailed delineation of supporting arguments was published in April 2018 (HBM-Commission, 2018). In contrast to the HBM-I, the HBM-II value corresponds to the concentration in human biological material which, when exceeded, may lead to health impairment which is considered as relevant to exposed individuals (HBM-Commission, 1996, HBM-Commission, 2014). HBM-II values for PFOA and PFOS: On September 17, 2019, the HBM Commission of the German Environment Agency established the following HBM-II values: Women at child-bearing age: 5 ng PFOA/mL blood plasma; 10 ng PFOS/mL blood plasma; All other population groups: 10 ng PFOA/mL blood plasma; 20 ng PFOS/mL blood plasma. © 2021",cholesterol; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; biological monitoring; birth weight; concentration (parameter); developmental toxicity; environmental exposure; fertility; groups by age; human; medical expert; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; uncertainty; animal; biological monitoring; blood; pollutant; risk assessment; toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Biological Monitoring; Caprylates; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Risk Assessment

The average caloric value of MCT is 8.25 kcal/g. MCT are quicker hydrolized compared to triglycerides consisting of long-chain fatty acids (LCT). Medium-chain fatty acids reach the liver, where most of the MCT is oxidized, via the portal vein. Acetyl-CoA produced by β-oxidation is further oxidized to CO2 and may be used for ketone body formation and de-novo synthesis of fatty acids. In the majority of studies, the β-hydroxybutyrate plasma level increased after intake of MCT. Some of the medium-chain fatty acids are subject to omega-oxidation from which dicarbonic acids result. Weight loss in persons on reduction diets is increased by exchange of LCT containing food by food containing MCT. This is due to the lower caloric value of MCT and higher energy losses, compared to LCT, by nutritional thermogenesis and/or a higher basal metabolism. If LCT are replaced by MCT, about 2 kcal/g fat are saved, provided the MCT are triglycerides with C8 and C10 fatty acids. In obese persons, oxidation of dietary long-chain, but not of medium-chain fatty acids, could be reduced. Some studies have shown MCT to enhance the feeling of satiation. These advantages of MCT help in reduction diets and increase compliance.",3 hydroxybutyric acid; acetyl coenzyme A; carbon dioxide; decanoic acid; hexanoic acid; ketone body; lauric acid; long chain fatty acid; medium chain triacylglycerol; octanoic acid; triacylglycerol; basal metabolic rate; body weight; calorie; diet restriction; fatty acid omega oxidation; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid synthesis; human; obesity; portal vein; review; satiety; thermogenesis; weight reduction

To prepare the present review, the relevant papers were identified by searching the Scopus database and extracting papers from 2007 to 2020. There is a wide variety of different membranes, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Perfluorinated and non-fluorinated membranes were evaluated based on different properties, including proton conductivity, power density (PD), water uptake, and ion exchange capacity. Results reveal that non-fluorinated membranes such as sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK), graphene oxide/SPEEK (GO/SPEEK), polyethersulfone (PES) and polysulfone (PS) and sulfonated polybenzimidazole (S-OPBI) are a good choice to replace the commonly used membrane Nafion™ because of their lower cost and higher energy recovery. Sulfonated membranes such as polyethersulfone/SPEEK (PES/SPEEK) and Sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES) show the highest normalized energy recovery. Although Nafion™ has the highest proton conductivity and is an excellent choice as proton exchange membrane (PEM) for MFCs, its energy recovery capacity is lower than that of porous and microfiltration membranes. It can also be very sensitive to biofouling. In the following, different parameters of membrane characterization and also wastewater treatment are discussed. The energy recovery of the membranes and systems studied was measured in order to recommend a suitable membrane for MFCs to improve the efficiency of these systems in terms of clean electricity generation and wastewater treatment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Cost effectiveness; Ethers; Graphene; Ion exchange; Ion exchange membranes; Ketones; Membranes; Microbial fuel cells; Microfiltration; Molecular biology; Proton conductivity; Recovery; Wastewater treatment; Membrane characterization; Micro-filtration membranes; Non-fluorinated membranes; Proton exchange membranes; Proton-exchange membrane; Sulfonated polybenzimidazole; Sulfonated polyetheretherketone; Sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES); Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)

PFOA and its salts are commercially used in various industrial processes. The chemical is persistent in the environment and does not undergo biotransformation. It was reported that PFOA is found not only in the serum of occupationally exposed workers but also general populations. Recent studies have suggested that the biological half-life of PFOA in humans is 4.37 years based on study of occupationally exposed workers. It is increasingly suspect that PFOA accumulates and affects human health, although the toxicokinetics of PFOA in humans remain unclear. In experimental animals, PFOA seems low in toxicity. PFOA is well-absorbed following oral and inhalation exposure, and to a lesser extent following dermal exposure. Once absorbed in the body, it distributes predominantly to the liver and plasma, and to a lesser extent the kidney and lungs. PFOA is excreted in both urine and feces. Biological half-life of PFOA is quite different between species and sexes and the difference is due mainly to the difference in renal clearance. In rats, renal clearance of PFOA is regulated by sex hormones, especially testosterone. PFOA is excreted into urine by active tubular secretion, and certain organic anion transporters are thought to be responsible for the secretion. Fecal excretion is also important in the elimination of PFOA. There is evidence that PFOA undergoes enterohepatic circulation resulting in reduced amounts of fecal excretion. Elucidation of the mechanisms of transport in biological systems leads to elimination and detoxification of this chemical in the human body.",carrier protein; perfluorooctanoic acid; sex hormone; absorption; anion transport; drug distribution; enterohepatic circulation; half life time; human; kidney clearance; nonhuman; occupational exposure; occupational toxicology; review; sex difference; species difference; toxicokinetics; urinary excretion; Animalia

We begin in this article by reviewing the available literature on the levels of POPs over the TP. In general, the levels of most POPs are similar or lower than values reported for other background regions. However, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) levels in air and soil far exceed those measured in other mountainous areas. The East Asian monsoon, Indian Monsoon and westerly winds are responsible for the long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT) and arrival of POPs over the TP. Surface soil and vegetation act as “final sinks” for DDTs and other high molecular weight POPs. Linked to the continuous use of POPs in surrounding counties, LRAT and “cold trapping” by the TP can happen following emission–transport–deposition events, leading to the enrichment of POPs in the TP environment. Bioaccumulation of DDTs and high chlorinated PCBs have been found in Tibetan terrestrial and aquatic food chains, and newly emerging compounds such as polyfluoroalkyl substances and hexabromocyclododecanes have been widely detected in wild fish species. The corresponding ecological risks should be of great concern. Climate change, such as increased temperatures and changing coverage of snow and glaciers, has the potential to affect the behavior and distribution of POPs. Therefore, long-term monitoring data are required. Ineffective regulation regarding POPs has been reported for countries in South Asia, emissions patterns, the outflow of POPs, and their seasonal and inter-annual variability should therefore be clarified. Estimating the loading of POPs, as well as how they move, within the TP, especially under the impact of glacial melt and global warming, should be a priority. © 2016",Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Biochemistry; Chemical contamination; Climate change; Ecology; Global warming; Pollution; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane; Long-range atmospheric transports; Long-term monitoring datum; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Persistent organic pollutants; Sink; Source; Tibetan Plateau; Organic pollutants; chemical compound; chlorphenotane; hexabromocyclododecane; hexachlorobenzene; hexachlorocyclohexane; organic carbon; organic matter; perfluoroalkyl acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; polychlorinated naphthalene; rain; snow; unclassified drug; chlorphenotane; lindane; atmospheric transport; bioaccumulation; climate change; DDT; fish; future prospect; HCH; long range transport; persistent organic pollutant; air pollution; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric transport; bioaccumulation; climate change; concentration (parameters); environmental temperature; fish; food chain; human; nonhuman; persistent organic pollutant; pollution; priority journal; Review; soil pollution; surface soil; Tibet; vegetation; water pollution; yak; air pollutant; analysis; environmental monitoring; forecasting; procedures; wind; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Air Pollutants; Climate Change; DDT; Environmental Monitoring; Forecasting; Lindane; Tibet; Wind

Much lower values of Σμ1D, covering the range from 0.009 to 0.125 cm2/(V s), are found for solution-synthesized conjugated polymers for which six different backbone structures have been investigated. This is attributed mainly to their complex morphology and the resulting static disorder in the backbone structure. The highest mobilities for this class of material, ca. 0.1 cm2/(V s), are found for liquid crystalline derivatives of polyfluorene and poly(phenylenevinylene). Larger mobilities are found for discotic materials, with maximum values close to 1 cm2/(V s) in both the crystalline solid and liquid crystalline phases.

Another possibility may be that most BC studies are skewed towards individuals at average risk, which may limit the ability to detect signals from ECE. Objectives: We reviewed the literature on ECE and BC focusing on three types of studies or subgroup analyses based on higher absolute BC risk: BC family history (Type 1); early onset BC (Type 2); and/or genetic susceptibility (Type 3). Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed database to identify epidemiologic studies examining ECE and BC risk published through June 1, 2019. Results: We identified 100 publications in 56 unique epidemiologic studies. Of these 56 studies, only 2 (3.6%) were enriched with BC family history and only 11% of studies (6/56) were specifically enriched with early onset cases. 80% of the publications from these 8 enriched studies (Type 1: 8/10 publications; Type 2: 8/10 publications) supported a statistically significant association between ECE and BC risk including studies of PAH, indoor cooking, NO2, DDT; PCBs, PFOSA; metals; personal care products; and occupational exposure to industrial dyes. 74% of Type 3 publications (20/27) supported statistically significant associations for PAHs, traffic-related air pollution, PCBs, phthalates, and PFOSAs in subgroups of women with greater genetic susceptibility due to variants in carcinogen metabolism, DNA repair, oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis and tumor suppressor genes. Discussion: Studies enriched for women at higher BC risk through family history, younger age of onset and/or genetic susceptibility consistently support an association between an ECE and BC risk. In addition to measuring exposures during WOS, designing studies that are enriched with women at higher absolute risk are necessary to robustly measure the role of ECE on BC risk. © 2020 The Authors",cancer; carcinogen; epidemiology; gene expression; health risk; literature review; pollution exposure; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; breast tumor; cooking; environmental exposure; female; human; Breast Neoplasms; Cooking; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons

It also analyzes the influence of fluorinated ligands on the catalytic activity of the complexes. The choice, structure and positions of fluorinated substituents in NHC ligands are generally dictated by the desire to increase the electrophilicity of the ruthenium atom due to the electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms and fluoroalkyl groups, resulting, as a rule, in an increase in the activity of the ruthenium complex. In catalysts with unsymmetrical fluorine-containing NHC ligands, there is a possibility of additional Ru-F coordination, making the complexes much more stable and, consequently, more active. The presence of fluorine in chelating alkylidene ligands provides an increase in the catalyst initiation rate due to a weakening of the ruthenium-heteroatom bond. Besides, the introduction of polyfluoroalkyl groups into ligands solves the problem of catalyst recovery using fluorous biphasic systems for reuse.

According to the arrangement of the fluorene unit and its chemical location on the chain, polyfluorene family was expressed in three classes; fluorene EC homopolymers, copolymers and functional EC polymers. With its sometimes surprising properties and countless advantages, fluorene monomer has many contributions to the electrochromic conductive polymer chain. Although there are many fluorene derived polymers in the literature that have been functionalized and/or used in various applications, this review only found it appropriate to focus on conductive electrochromic polymers with possessing fluorene chemical units. For this purpose, it has been tried to review and comment on fluorene polymers by comparing their chemical, electrochemical and optical properties in a logical framework. One of the biggest problems of electrochromic conductive polymer researchers is to analyze how the redox and electrochromic properties of polymers, which consist of a functional group, change according to the position on the conjugated polymer chain. For this reason, it is thought that the contribution and guideness of this study to the literature will be considerable. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Electrochromic devices; Electrochromism; Electropolymerization; Chemical polymerization; Conductive Polymer; Electrochromic polymers; Electrochromics; Fluorenes; Functional conjugated polymer; Polyfluorene copolymer; Polyfluorene homopolymer; Polyfluorenes; Polymer chains; Conjugated polymers

Study of inter-specific variation in the FTs of plants aids in classifying species into plant functional types (PFTs) and provides insights into fundamental patterns and trade-offs in plant form and functioning and the effect of changing species composition on ecosystem functions. Specifically, this paper focuses on those FTs that make a species successful in the dry tropical environment. Following a brief overview, we discuss plant FTs that may be particularly relevant to tropical deciduous forests (TDFs). We consider the traits under the following categories: leaf traits, stem and root traits, reproductive traits, and traits particularly relevant to water availability. We compile quantitative information on functional traits of dry tropical forest species. We also discuss trait-based grouping of plants into PFTs. We recognize that there is incomplete knowledge about many FTs and their effects on TDFs and point out the need for further research on PFTs of TDF species, which can enable prediction of the dynamics of these forests in the face of disturbance and global climate change. Correlations between structural and ecophysiological traits and ecosystem functioning should also be established which could make it possible to generate predictions of changes in ecosystem services from changes in functional composition. © Indian Academy of Sciences.",autecology; deciduous forest; ecophysiology; ecosystem function; environmental change; environmental effect; environmental factor; functional morphology; interspecific variation; plant; quantitative analysis; research work; tropical forest; biodiversity; climate change; forest; forest dynamics; functional trait; interspecific variation; moisture; nonhuman; plant evolution; plant leaf; plant reproduction; plant root; plant stem; plant structures; review; seasonal variation; species composition; species differentiation; tree; tropical deciduous forest; water availability; ecosystem; physiology; reproduction; species difference; tree; tropic climate; Ecosystem; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Plant Stems; Reproduction; Species Specificity; Trees; Tropical Climate

Recent studies have shown that cadmium (e.g., cadmium chloride, CdCl2) and PFOS exert their disruptive effects through putative signaling proteins and signaling cascade similar to other pharmaceuticals, such as the non-hormonal male contraceptive drug adjudin. More important, these signaling proteins were also shown to be involved in modulating testis function based on studies in rodents. Collectively, these findings suggest that toxicants are using similar mechanisms that used to support spermatogenesis under physiological conditions to perturb Sertoli and testis function. These observations are physiologically significant, since a manipulation on the expression of these signaling proteins can possibly be used to manage the toxicant-induced male reproductive dysfunction. In this review, we highlight some of these findings and critically evaluate the possibility of using this approach to manage toxicant-induced defects in spermatrogenesis based on recent studies in animal models.

NA,Birth weight and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid: A random-effects meta-regression analysis,2020,NA,NA,"Background: Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant. Most people in developed countries have detectable serum concentrations. Lower birth weight has been associated with serum PFOS in studies world-wide, many of which have been published only recently. Methods: To facilitate a causal assessment of the birth weight and PFOS association, we updated previous meta-analyses of the association and employed a method that facilitated inclusion of all available data in one analysis. Our analysis was based on observations from 29 studies. Results: The random effects summary was -3.22 g/ng/ml (95% confidence interval [CI] = -5.11, -1.33). In a subgroup analysis stratified by when in pregnancy the PFOS concentration was measured, the summary for the early group was -1.35 (95% CI = -2.33, -0.37) and for the later group was -7.17 (95% CI = -10.93, -3.41). In a meta-regression model including a term for timing of blood draw, the intercept was slightly positive but essentially zero (0.59 g/ng/ml, 95% CI = -1.94, 3.11). In other words, the model indicated that when blood was drawn at the very beginning of pregnancy, there was essentially no relation of birth weight to PFOS. The results from the subgroup analyses differed from those from the model because the average gestational age at blood draw in the early group was 14 weeks, when bias would still be expected. A stronger inverse association in Asian studies was not completely explained by their blood draws being from later in pregnancy. Conclusions: The evidence was weakly or not supportive of a causal association. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health. All rights reserved.",NA

Compared with biological, physical, and chemical methods, electrocatalytic oxidation technology has the advantages of a strong oxidation ability, high efficiency, mild reaction conditions, and high automation. The direct and indirect electrochemical oxidation mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxidation processes are discussed. The generation processes and properties of oxidative species in indirect electrochemical oxidation processes, including hydroxyl radicals, active chlorine, sulfate radicals, O3, H2O2, carbonate radicals, and 1O2, are summarized. The cell designs involved in the flow-by, flow-through, and three-dimensional configurations are outlined. The removal ratios, intermediate products, and electrocatalytic oxidation mechanisms of halogenated pollutants, including perfluorinated, polyfluorinated, chlorinated, brominated, and iodinated organic compounds, are reviewed. The oxidative and mineralization ability, detoxification ability, and energy consumptions of electrocatalytic oxidation compared with other technologies are comprehensively evaluated. This Review are intended to introduce some effective strategies for lowering energy consumption in electrocatalytic oxidation processes. Finally, the current deficiencies and development trends in electrocatalytic oxidation are discussed. © 2022 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.",NA

PBDEs are used as a flame-retardant and are found in consumer goods such as electrical equipment, construction materials, coatings, textiles and polyurethane foam (furniture padding). Similar in structure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), PBDEs resist degradation in the environment. Less brominated PBDEs like tetra-, penta- and hexa- demonstrate high affinity for lipids and can accumulate in the bodies of animals and humans. Breast milk from North American women contained much higher amounts of PBDEs than levels in breast milk from Swedish women, indicating that North American exposures to PBDEs may be particularly high. Evidence to date suggests that tetra- and penta-BDEs are likely to be the more toxic and bioaccumulative of the PBDE compounds, compared to octa- and deca-congeners. PBDEs are sold as mixtures, under names such as ""pentabromodiphenyl ether"" and ""octabromodiphenyl ether."" The pentabromo product is a mixture of tetra-BDEs and penta-BDEs in approximately equal amounts. Pentabromo consists of PBDEs that are believed to be the most toxic. This mixture has been banned by the European Union, but is still used in North America. The United States is the leading producer and user of pentabromo. In August 2003, the State of California passed a bill to phase out the use of penta- and octa-PBDE by 2008. The toxicology of PBDEs is not well understood, but PBDEs have been associated with tumors, neurodevelopmental toxicity and thyroid hormone imbalance. The neurotoxic effects of PBDEs are similar to those observed for PCBs. Children exposed to PBDEs are prone to subtle but measurable developmental problems. It is presumed that PBDEs are endocrine disruptors, but research in this area is scant. Further studies are imperative in a multitude of health and environmental disciplines to determine the adverse effects and mode of action of this widespread emerging pollutant on human health.",diphenyl ether derivative; pentabromodiphenyl ether; polybrominated biphenyl; animal; chemically induced disorder; chemistry; endocrine disease; human; pollutant; review; thyroid disease; Animals; Endocrine System Diseases; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Phenyl Ethers; Polybrominated Biphenyls; Thyroid Diseases

While protocols focusing on catalytic asymmetric fluorination, (di)fluoroalkylation, and trifluoromethylation have been well developed, elegant strategies for the synthesis of enantioenriched monofluoro- and gem-difluoroalkenes remain highly sought after. As two vital subunits of organofluorides, both monofluoro- and gem-difluoroalkenes are pervasive within many biologically active molecules. They serve as the mimics of alkenyl, enol, and peptide bonds and the carbonyl group, respectively, which may enhance the bioactivities of the parent molecules. In addition, they are active handles for the construction of other fluorinated molecules. In this review, insightful discussions on the latest achievements of the catalytic asymmetric strategies associated with the facile synthesis of both monofluoro- and gem-difluoroalkenes are provided. The related mechanism considerations, applications in streamlining syntheses, limitations, and the opportunities of the state-of-the-art methodologies will be highlighted.

In the aerospace industry, ice accretion has led to a large number of casualties and costs the industry billions of dollars every year. To design effective anti-/de-icing systems, the adhesion of ice to surfaces must be understood. In this review paper, the authors surveyed for papers providing methods for the measurement of ice adhesion. 113 papers were identified for comparison, with data being extracted from 58 papers with common test surfaces (aluminum, steel, Teflon® (Chemours), and polyurethane). The methods used were categorized and data were compared based on their precision and the trends they demonstrated. Conceptual problems were identified with the tests used in the literature and discussed, and open questions relevant to testing the adhesion of ice were identified. Several key parameters affecting ice adhesion identified from the literature were temperature, surface roughness, strain rate, and impact velocity. Their effects on adhesion strength were discussed. While researching this topic, it was discovered that many papers did not report the strain rate in their tests, and the vast majority of papers did not correct their data for stress concentrations on the surface, either of which has been shown to cause variation in the data by one order of magnitude. Data compared from the literature typically spanned one to three orders of magnitude. The causes of these variations were discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Adhesion; Aerospace industry; Ice problems; Paper; Strain rate; Surface roughness; Anti/de-icing; Conceptual problems; Critical review; Impact velocities; Review papers; Solid substrates; Technical fields; Three orders of magnitude; Ice

Partial liquid ventilation can be used for the following goals: recruitment of lung volume; enhancement or uniformity of lung inflation; improved oxygenation; improved lung compliance; and prevention or minimization of lung damage induced by mechanical ventilation. Partial liquid ventilation improved gas exchange and lung mechanics in test subjects. Cardiopulmonary interaction and long-term safety require further study. Extrapolations from animal data, however, suggest that there are no long-term undesired effects. The current clinical data strongly suggest that close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator parameters during drug instillation are necessary to reduce hypoxia, bradycardia, and pneumothorax. Further studies are required to explore the efficacy of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbon in ALI or ARDS subjects, in particular, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of smaller doses; mechanical ventilation strategies; and outcomes. Additional research including large randomized studies is clearly required to answer these and other questions.","fluorocarbon; adult respiratory distress syndrome; animal; artificial ventilation; human; review; Animals; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult"

They are still considered rare and even of less clinical importance. This not only reflects (as in all PIDs) a great lack of awareness among clinicians and general practitioners but is also due to the fact that only few centers worldwide provide a comprehensive laboratory complement analysis. To enable early identification, our aim is to present warning signs for complement deficiencies and recommendations for diagnostic approach. The genetic deficiency of any early component of the classical pathway (C1q, C1r/s, C2, C4) is often associated with autoimmune diseases whereas individuals, deficient of properdin or of the terminal pathway components (C5 to C9), are highly susceptible to meningococcal disease. Deficiency of C1 Inhibitor (hereditary angioedema, HAE) results in episodic angioedema, which in a considerable number of patients with identical symptoms also occurs in factor XII mutations. New clinical entities are now reported indicating disease association with partial complement defects or even certain polymorphisms (factor H, MBL, MASPs). Mutations affecting the regulators factor H, factor I, or CD46 and of C3 and factor B leading to severe dysregulation of the alternative pathway have been associated with renal disorders, such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and - less frequent - with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). We suggest a multi-stage diagnostic protocol starting based on the recognition of so called warning signs which should aid pediatricians and adult physicians in a timely identification followed by a step-wise complement analysis to characterize the defect at functional, protein and molecular level. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",alternative complement pathway C3 C5 convertase; CD11b antigen; CD59 antigen; complement; complement component C1q; complement component C1r; complement component C2; complement component C4; complement component C4 binding protein; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement factor H; decay accelerating factor; fibrinogen; mannose binding lectin; membrane cofactor protein; properdin; thrombomodulin; angioneurotic edema; autoimmune disease; bacterial infection; complement deficiency; epidemic meningitis; gene mutation; glomerulopathy; hemolytic uremic syndrome; human; immune deficiency; membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; meningococcosis; priority journal; retina macula age related degeneration; review; Complement analysis; Complement deficiencies; Infections; Meningitis; Prevalence; Warning signs; Complement System Proteins; Humans; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; Prevalence

Thus, the system imposes a strong selection pressure on viruses. Consequently, viruses have evolved multiple countermeasures against host complement. A major mechanism employed by viruses to subvert the complement system is encoding proteins that target complement. Since viruses have limited genome size, most of these proteins are multifunctional in nature.

However, the only successful transgenic bioreactors have been based on mammals. We have developed two key techniques for obtaining transgenic birds. For bird embryo culture, we identified that the low rate of hatchability of cultured embryos is caused by limited oxygen and calcium availability. In quail embryo culture using a chicken eggshell as a culture vessel, hatchability increased to 80% by the supplement of calcium lactate in addition to oxygen aeration. A fully artificial vessel for quail embryo culture using a gas-permeable Teflon membrane was also designed. Although the hatchability was lower than that of cultures using a surrogate eggshell, we succeeded in hatching of bird embryos using a fully artificial vessel. For transgene introduction, a replication-defective pantropic retroviral vector based on Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) was injected to laid embryos at the blastodermal stage, and the embryos were hatched in vitro to generate G0 birds.

NA,State of the evidence 2017: An update on the connection between breast cancer and the environment,2017,NA,NA,"Background: In this review, we examine the continually expanding and increasingly compelling data linking radiation and various chemicals in our environment to the current high incidence of breast cancer. Singly and in combination, these toxicants may have contributed significantly to the increasing rates of breast cancer observed over the past several decades. Exposures early in development from gestation through adolescence and early adulthood are particularly of concern as they re-shape the program of genetic, epigenetic and physiological processes in the developing mammary system, leading to an increased risk for developing breast cancer. In the 8 years since we last published a comprehensive review of the relevant literature, hundreds of new papers have appeared supporting this link, and in this update, the evidence on this topic is more extensive and of better quality than that previously available. Conclusion: Increasing evidence from epidemiological studies, as well as a better understanding of mechanisms linking toxicants with development of breast cancer, all reinforce the conclusion that exposures to these substances - many of which are found in common, everyday products and byproducts - may lead to increased risk of developing breast cancer. Moving forward, attention to methodological limitations, especially in relevant epidemiological and animal models, will need to be addressed to allow clearer and more direct connections to be evaluated. © 2017 The Author(s).",NA

Fluorocarbon solvents and polymers, and solvents or polymers with similar properties that are not composed solely of carbon and fluorine (so-called 'fluorous' solvents or polymers) have a low ability to dissolve or sorb solutes or penetrants. This lack of solvating ability can lead to selective extractions. Fluorous phases will solvate, and therefore extract or transport, fluorous solutes, or non-fluorous solutes that are stabilized in the fluorous phase by non-covalent interactions with a 'host' or 'receptor' molecule that is in the fluorous phase. In this review, there is a brief discussion of molecular recognition as applied to selective extraction. Fluorous solvents are introduced, and there is a description of some recent applications, chiefly in synthetic organic chemistry. In particular, it is important to understand solute partitioning behavior and methods to predict it when one of the solvents is fluorous. Fluorous polymers Teflon AF1600 and AF2400 have been used in separations. Their rather complex and still not completely understood properties in separations and transport are described. There is a discussion of molecular recognition in fluorous phases as well as a brief discussion of efficient methods of carrying out extractions for analytical or physicochemical purposes. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.",Efficient method; Fluorous; Fluorous solvents; Isolation and purification; Non-covalent interaction; Sample clean-up; Selective extraction; Solute partitioning; Synthetic organic chemistry; Teflon AF; Biological materials; Complexation; Fluorine; Metal recovery; Molecular biology; Molecular recognition; Polymers; Solvents; Solvent extraction; cinnamyl alcohol; fluorocarbon; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorotributylamine; phenobarbital; polymer; pyridine derivative; analytic method; chemical composition; chemical interaction; chemical structure; covalent bond; ecotoxicity; molecular recognition; molecular stability; phase partitioning; phase separation; physical chemistry; priority journal; process technology; purification; review; solid phase extraction; solvation; solvent extraction; transport kinetics; Chemical Fractionation; Fluorescent Dyes; Polymers

Because of the long-term production of PFAS using ECF, which created branched isomers as byproducts in addition to the intended linear product, branched isomers of PFAS account for a significant portion of PFAS load in the environment. The distribution of isomers is not consistent in the environment, however. Geographic location appears to be a major factor in determining the isomer makeup of PFAS in surface and groundwater as well as in humans and animals. This is largely to differences in production methods; a region that produced PFAS via ECF for many years would have a higher ratio of branched isomers than one that produces PFAS using telomerization. In addition, the different structures of branched PFAS isomers as compared to linear PFAS appear to affect transport in the environment. Research suggests that linear PFAS sorb preferentially to soil and sediments, whereas branched isomers are more likely to remain in water. The higher polarity of the branched structure explains this difference. Studies in humans and animals show that most animals preferentially accumulate the linear PFOS isomer, but humans appear to preferentially accumulate the branched isomers as they are often found in human serum at percentages higher than that of ECF product. In addition, some studies have indicated that linear and branched PFAS isomers have some unique negative health associations. Very few studies, however, account for linear and branched PFAS separately. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Animals; Groundwater; Plants (botany); Branched isomers; Branched structures; Different structure; Geographic location; Long term production; Perfluorinated alkyl substances; Production methods; Soil and sediment; Isomers; ground water; perfluoro compound; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; sea water; surface water; byproduct; health impact; organohalogen; spatial distribution; transport process; absorption; analytic method; bioaccumulation; biosolid; blood level; chemical analysis; chemical composition; chemical modification; chemical parameters; chemical procedures; chemical structure; ecosystem restoration; electrochemistry; environmental health; fluorination; geography; health hazard; human; isomer; nonhuman; pregnant woman; priority journal; Review; sediment; soil pollutant; synthesis; water pollutant; wildlife; Animalia

In this review, we analyzed the available data on the catalytic systems containing rhodium halides and redox co-catalysts and their implementation to oxidation of methane and other lower alkanes. Based on experimental data and DFT results, we suggest possible mechanisms for oxidative functionalization of methane and propane. Activation of methane may get started with formation of a σ-complex with Rh. Activation of dioxygen takes place at the activated species of redox co-catalysts - iodine, copper or iron compounds - and leads to formation of two-electron oxidants. The redox co-catalysts may also interact with Rh. The activation of dioxygen is favored by the presence of added reducing agent (CO) which returns oxidized redox co-catalysts to their reduced form. The necessity of preliminary dioxygen reduction brings about analogy with biocatalysts for oxidation of alkanes. The oxidative carbonylation of methane to acetic acid most likely proceeds via an intermediate with the CH3-Rh bond. The formation of alcohols and acetone is consistent with formation of intermediate complexes containing the Rh-OI and Rh-O-O-Cu fragments. The esterification of alcohols with ingressed perfluorocarboxylic acids prevents from deep oxidation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Acetone; Carbon monoxide; Carbonylation; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Chemical activation; Copper compounds; Iron compounds; Methane; Oxidation; Paraffins; Quantum chemistry; Redox reactions; Rhodium; Dioxygens; Functionalizations; Oxidation of methane; Oxidative carbonylation; Oxidative functionalization; Perfluorocarboxylic acid; Quantum chemical calculations; Two-electron oxidants; Rhodium compounds

In this context, the signalling hub protein RACK1 (Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1) could represent a nexus between cancer and the immune system due to its roles in cancer progression and innate immune activation. Since RACK1 is a relevant EDCs target that responds to steroid-active compounds, it could be considered a molecular bridge between the endocrine-regulated tumour microenvironment and the innate immune system.

NA,Effects of Environmental Contaminants in Inflammatory Bowel Disease ; A Systematic Review,2020,NA,NA,"Introduction: The Inflammatory Bowel Disease is characterized by a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and it has two important forms: Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Although the pathophysiology of the disease is mostly unknown, an interaction between immune system, genetics, microbiome and environmental factors seem to be responsible for the disease onset. The role of environmental factors in the pathophysiology of this disease is reinforced if we consider the rapid growth in incidence and prevalence rates of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in areas where the incidence was low as for example Asia. However, the literature on the role of environmental factors in Inflammatory Bowel Disease is reduced and not systematized. Objectives: To study the effect of environmental contaminants on Inflammatory Bowel Disease through a systematic review of the literature. Methods: For this systematic review the methodology ""Navigation Guide Method for Grading Human Evidence"" was used. The research was carried out in three databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed / MEDLINE). The inclusion criteria used were: research articles with original human data, clinically diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease, quantification of environmental contaminants and study of the association between environmental contaminants and Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Only written articles Portuguese, English, French or Spanish were included. Results: Sixteen studies were included in this systematic review. Of these, 13 studied Inflammatory Bowel Disease in general, 2 studies included only patients with Crohn's Disease and 1 study included only patients with Ulcerative Colitis. The most studied environmental contaminants were sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, perfluorooctanoic acid, aluminum, iron, zinc, copper, titanium dioxide, silicates and endotoxins. We also identified different categories, 4 studies on the effects of air pollution, 3 on the intake of contaminated water, 3 on the effects of diet. Additionally, 2 studies evaluated the serum concentrations of contaminants, 1 studied the impact of exposure to house dust, 2 tried to characterize cells of patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and in one study colitis was induced. Overall, the quality of evidence is moderate to low, and there is inadequate evidence on the effect of environmental contaminants on Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Discussion: In this systematic review, we have identified different classes of environmental contaminants, but studies analyzing the concentration of environmental contaminants in biological matrices are rare. Given the different confounding factors that were not taken into account and the variability between studies it is difficult to draw conclusions on the real role of environmental contaminants on the onset of Inflammatory Bowel Disease or in flares. Conclusion: Based on a moderate to low level of quality, the available evidence gathered in this systematic review is insufficient to access the effects of environmental contaminants Inflammatory Bowel Disease. New epidemiological studies are necessary. ; Introdução: A Doença Inflamatória Intestinal é caracterizada por uma inflamação crónica do trato gastrointestinal e possui duas formas importantes: Doença de Crohn e Colite Ulcerosa. Embora a fisiopatologia da doença seja praticamente desconhecida, as evidências recentes sugerem que esta patologia resulta da interação de diferentes fatores, nomeadamente, imunológicos, genéticos, o microbioma e o ambiente. O papel dos fatores ambientais na fisiopatologia desta doença é reforçado se considerarmos o rápido crescimento nas taxas de incidência e prevalência da Doença Inflamatória Intestinal em zonas onde a incidência era baixa, como é o caso da Ásia. No entanto, a bibliografia acerca do papel dos fatores ambientais na doença inflamatória intestinal é reduzida e não se encontra sistematizada. Objetivos: Estudar o efeito dos contaminantes ambientais na doença inflamatória intestinal através de uma revisão sistemática da literatura. Métodos: Para esta revisão sistemática foi utilizada a metodologia “Navigation Guide Method for Grading Human Evidence”. A pesquisa foi realizada em três bases de dados (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE). Os critérios de inclusão utilizados foram: artigos de investigação com dados originais em humanos, doença inflamatória intestinal clinicamente diagnosticada, quantificação de contaminantes ambientais e estudo da associação entre contaminantes ambientais e doença inflamatória intestinal. Apenas artigos escritos português, inglês, francês ou espanhol foram incluídos. Resultados: Foram incluídos nesta revisão sistemática 16 estudos. Destes, 13 estudaram a Doença Inflamatória Intestinal com referências para a Doença de Crohn e Colite Ulcerosa, 2 estudos incluem apenas pacientes com Doença de Crohn e 1 apenas pacientes com Colite Ulcerosa. Os contaminantes ambientais mais estudados foram dióxido de enxofre, dióxido de nitrogénio, monóxido de carbono, material particulado, ácido perfluorooctanóico, alumínio, ferro, zinco, cobre, dióxido de titânio, silicatos e endotoxinas. Identificamos também grupos de estudo, 4 relacionados com poluição do ar, 3 relacionados com a ingestão de água contaminada 3 relacionados com a dieta, 2 em que as concentrações séricas de contaminantes foram avaliadas, 1 estudou a exposição a pó doméstico, 2 tentaram caracterizar células de pacientes com Doença Inflamatória Intestinal e num estudo tentaram induzir colite. De uma forma geral, a qualidade do corpo de evidência é moderada a baixa, e o efeito dos contaminantes ambientais na Doença Inflamatória Intestinal não foi comprovado. Discussão: Nesta revisão sistemática, identificamos várias classes diferentes de contaminantes ambientais, mas estudos que analisam a concentração real de contaminantes ambientais em matrizes biológicas são raros. Considerando os vários fatores de confundimento que não foram tidos em consideração e a variabilidade entre estudos, torna-se difícil extrair conclusões sobre a influência destes contaminantes no início da Doença Inflamatória Intestinal ou em crises. Conclusão: Com base num nível de qualidade moderado a baixo, a evidência reunida nesta revisão sistemática é insuficiente para avaliar o efeito dos contaminantes ambientais na doença inflamatória intestinal, pelo que novos estudos epidemiológicos necessitam ser realizados.",NA

The major findings are: 1) among the aqueous matrices for which data were reviewed, groundwater impacted by AFFF contamination showed the highest median concentrations for both perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), while the second-highest median concentrations were associated with landfill leachates for PFOA and metal-plating sources for PFOS; 2) many of the unknown polyfluorinated precursors present in AFFF-impacted sites could potentially convert to persistent PFAS by abiotic or biotic transformation, and therefore could act as the long-term source of contamination to the environment; 3) part per billion (ppb) concentrations of PFAS were detected in water bodies surrounding fluorochemical manufacturing plants; 4) in consumer products such as textile, paper, and personal care products, PFOA concentrations were an order of magnitude higher compared to other PFAS; 5) biotransformation products such as fluorotelomer carboxylic acids (FTCAs) and perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are detected in landfill leachates and WWTP effluents; and 6) many studies have shown increased PFAA concentrations in WWTP effluents compared to influents.

PFASs are a broad class of man-made substances that have been produced and used in both commercial products and industrial processes for more than 60 years. Although the production and use of some PFASs has been phased-out in some parts of the world, it is not known what effect these actions to date have had on PFAS concentrations in the environment. Owing to the wide diversity of PFASs, it is difficult to generalize their properties, environmental fate and production histories. However, the strength and stability of the C-F bond renders the perfluoroalkyl moieties resistant to heat and environmental degradation. Several PFASs are now occurring even in very remote areas in large parts of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of substances within this group is not well understood. A systematic review may be able to determine whether the concentrations of these substances in different environments are changing in any particular direction with time, and whether the phase-outs have had any effects on the concentration trends. Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations in the environment will be performed in the scientific literature as well as in other reports. Relevant samples include both abiotic and biological samples including humans. No particular time, document type, language or geographical constraints will be applied. Two authors will screen all retrieved articles. Double screening of about 10% of the articles will be performed by all authors at both title/abstract and full-text levels. Kappa tests will be used to test if the screening is consistent. Relevant articles will be critically appraised by four authors (double checking of 25% of the articles). Quality assessment will focus on selection bias, dating of samples, sample integrity and analytical procedures. Data synthesis will be based on statistical analysis of temporal concentration trends. © 2015 Land et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",NA

Biochar has an enormous potential in addressing these global issues and can act as a catalyst in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Biochar produced from waste biomass (crop residues, algal biomass, municipal waste, etc.) has dual advantages of waste management along with its application in different sectors. The mineral contents and buffering capacity of biochar make it an ultimate catalyst for anaerobic digestion which significantly enhances bioenergy production. Supplementing anaerobic digestion with biochar can increase biogas and biological hydrogen production up to 57% and 118% respectively, over control. Biochar addition to soil improves soil health, porosity and aeration which mitigates greenhouse gas emission from soil. Addition of biochar at the optimum level in rice can reduce cumulative methane emission up to 60%. In this manuscript, the potential of biochar for bioenergy production (biogas and biological hydrogen production), greenhouse gases mitigation, carbon sequestration in soils, and waste water remediation is discussed in detail along with the challenges and future prospects of biochar.

It is characterized by a number of symptoms induced by the exposure of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa to allergenic proteins belonging to class 1 or to class 2 food allergens. OAS occurring when patients sensitized to pollens are exposed to some fresh plant foods has been called pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS). In the wake of PFAS, several different associations of allergenic sources have been progressively proposed and called syndromes. Molecular allergology has shown that these associations are based on IgE co-recognition taking place between homologous allergens present in different allergenic sources. In addition, the molecular approach reveals that some allergens involved in OAS are also responsible for systemic reactions, as in the case of some food Bet v 1-related proteins, lipid transfer proteins and gibberellin regulated proteins. Therefore, in the presence of a convincing history of OAS, it becomes crucial to perform a patient's tailored molecule-based diagnosis in order to identify the individual IgE sensitization profile. This information allows the prediction of possible cross-reactions with homologous molecules contained in other sources. In addition, it allows the assessment of the risk of developing more severe symptoms on the basis of the features of the allergenic proteins to which the patient is sensitized. In this context, we aimed to provide an overview of the features of relevant plant allergenic molecules and their involvement in the clinical onset of OAS. The value of a personalized molecule-based approach to OAS diagnosis is also analyzed and discussed. © 2020 The Author(s).",allergen; Bet v 1 protein; cysteine proteinase; gibberellin regulated protein; immunoglobulin E; latex; lipid transfer protein; plant protein; profilin; seed storage protein; unclassified drug; allergy test; clinical feature; cross reaction; diagnostic value; disease association; disease risk assessment; disease severity; food allergy; human; immunology; medical history; molecular diagnosis; nonhuman; oral allergy syndrome; personalized medicine; plant; pollen food allergy syndrome; prick test; priority journal; protein structure; Review; sensitization

Although, the bioac-bioav concept is widely employed in PAH risk assessment for both humans and wildlife, their growth and integration in risk assessment models are seldom discussed. Consequently, the relevant literature listed on Web of Science (WOS)™ was retrieved and analyzed using the bibliometric software Citespace in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of this issue. Due to the limitations of the literature search software, we manually searched the articles about PAHs bioac-bioav that were published before 2000. This stage focuses on research on the distribution coefficient of PAHs between different environmental phases and laid the foundation for the adsorption-desorption of PAHs in subsequent studies of the bioac-bioav of PAHs. The research progress on PAH bioac-bioav from 2000 to the present was evaluated using the Citespace software based on country- and discipline-wise publication volumes and research hotspots. The development stages of PAH bioac-bioav after 2000 were divided into four time segments. The first three segments (2000–2005, 2006–2010, and 2011–2015) focused on the degradation of PAHs and their in vivo (bioavailability)-in vitro (bioaccessibility) evaluation method and risk assessment. Meanwhile, the current (2016–present) research focuses on the establishment of analytical methods for assessing PAH derivatives at environmental concentrations and the optimization of various in vitro digestion methods, including chemical optimization (sorptive sink) and biological optimization (Caco-2 cell).

This systematic review aims to determine the extent of this emerging problem, both quantitatively and qualitatively, combining temporal and science mapping analyses to explore the development of the field of UV-filters in the marine environment (from 1990 to 2021), and to outline new research frontiers. The temporal trend analysis revealed an exponential growth of published studies over the last decade (70% since 2016), confirming the emerging role of this topic in environmental science. The meta-analysis determined that 4-methylbenzylidene-camphor (4-MBC) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) are top-priority environmental pollutants due to their increasing usage and, in turn, a frequent occurrence in marine ecosystems. This meta-analysis determined the focus on these two contaminants for this review. A critical discussion of the applications, regulatory aspects, and environmental occurrences of these selected compounds was provided. The present study also focused on the most recent (2015–2021) field and laboratory studies investigating the ecotoxicological impacts of 4-MBC and BP-3 on marine invertebrates. This review highlights the need for more research efforts to fill the knowledge gaps on the realistic effects these compounds may have when considered individually, in combination, or as subsequent exposures.

Interestingly, all three are encoded from the q32-34 region of human chromosome 9, together with at least four other lipocalins (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, complement factor γ-subunit, tear prealbumin, and prostaglandin D synthase) that also may have anti-inflammatory and/or antimicrobial activity. This review addresses important features of this genetically linked subfamily of lipocalins (involvement with the acute phase response, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, the tissue localization, complex formation with other proteins and receptors, etc.). It is likely that these proteins have evolved to be an integrated part of the body's defense system as part of the extended cytokine network. Its members exert a regulatory, dampening influence on the inflammatory cascade, thereby protecting against tissue damage from excessive inflammation. That most major mammalian allergens are lipocalins may reflect this connection of lipocalins with the immune system. We propose that this immunologically active lipocalin subset be named the 'immunocalins', signifying not only the structural homology and close genetic linkage of its members, but also their protective involvement with immunological and inflammatory processes. As immune mediators, immunocalins appear to use at least three interactive sites: the lipocalin 'pocket', binding sites for other plasma proteins, and binding sites for cell surface receptors.

The use of photoinduced technology is a common strategy that uses the outstanding oxidation or reduction ability of a photoredox catalyst in its excited state to generate perfluoroalkyl radicals from perfluoroalkyl halides. The perfluoroalkyl radicals thus obtained can undergo various subsequent reactions under mild conditions, such as ATRA reaction of alkenes, alkynes, and 1,n-enynes; carbo/heteroperfluoroalkylation of alkenes and isocyanides; and C H/F perfluoroalkylation.

They are causing increasingly serious epidemiological problems in many communities globally due to consuming PFAS-contaminated water sources. Necessarily, the behavior of PFAS in water and wastewater needs to be understood better. This study attempts to comprehensively review, analyze and discuss PFAS based on the following key aspects: (i) sources, (ii) occurrence in water and wastewater, (iii) transformation, fate and migration, and (iv) remediation technologies. Studies indicated that modern water and wastewater treatment plants cannot deal completely with PFAS and in some cases, the removal efficiency is minus -3500-fold. The main reasons are the high hydrophobicity of PFAS and presence of PFAS precursors. Precursors can account for 33–63% of total PFAS concentration in water and wastewater. Detection and identification of precursors are challenging due to the requirement of advanced analytical instrument and standard chemicals. Several technologies have been developed for PFAS remediation involving two main mechanisms: separation-concentration and destruction. The most widespread in-use technology is adsorption because it is reasonably affordable. Anion exchange resin and synthesized materials are the most effective sorbents having a sorption capacity of 100–2000 mg PFAS/g sorbent, effective within a few hours. The destruction technology such as plasma can also be a promising one for degrading PFAS to below health-based standard in 1 min. However, plasma is costly and not yet ready for full scale application. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",NA

In the postnatal period, which was characterized morphologically by the nearly completed myelination, the spinal white matter appeared poorly vascularized. A temporary increase of spinal cord tract vascularization during myelination is probably caused by local secretion of angiogenic factors.

In the past five years, due to the development of new perfluoroalkylation reagents and methodologies, significant progress has been made in the field of transition-metal-mediated perfluoroalkylation. Compared with perfluoroalkylation, di- and monofluoroalkylation can not only introduce fluorine atom(s) into a molecule, but also install a non-fluorinated moiety simultaneously; therefore, in organic synthesis, these reactions are of higher step economy than the direct fluorination reactions. Although analogous to transition-metal-mediated perfluoroalkylations, the di- and monofluoroalkylation have been relatively less developed; therefore, there are still many opportunities for their development. In this review, we have made a survey on transition- metal-mediated di- and monofluoroalkylation reactions that were published in the past nearly 30 years. To our knowledge, this is the first rather comprehensive review on this topic. This review is divided into five sections. The first section is the general introduction on di- and monofluoroalkylation. The second and third sections focus on the historical development of transition-metal-mediated di- and monofluoroalkylation with reagents that contain functional groups. These two sections are subdivided according to the reactions types, that is, fluoroalkylation of unsaturated organohalides, fluoroalkylation of the carbon-hydrogen bonds of unsaturated systems (arenes, alkenes, alkynes, and carbonyl compounds), fluoroalkylation of organoborane reagents and organometallic reagents, fluoroalkyl addition to unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds.

Therefore, endurance athletes are recommended to ingest diets high in carbohydrate (70% of total energy) during competition and training. However, increasing the availability of plasma free fatty acids has been shown to slow the rate of muscle and liver glycogen depletion by promoting the utilization of fat. Ingested fat, in the form of long-chain (C16-22) triacylglycerols, is largely unavailable during acute exercise, but medium-chain (C8-10) triacylglycerols are rapidly absorbed and oxidized. We have shown that the ingestion of medium-chain triacylglycerols in combination with carbohydrate spares muscle carbohydrate stores during 2 h of submaximal (&lt; 70% VO2, peak) cycling exercise, and improves 40 km time-trial performance. These data suggest that by combining carbohydrate and medium-chain triacylglycerols as a pre-exercise supplement and as a nutritional supplement during exercise, fat oxidation will be enhanced, and endogenous carbohydrate will be spared. We have also examined the chronic metabolic adaptations and effects on substrate utilization and endurance performance when athletes ingest a diet that is high in fat (&gt; 70% by energy). Dietary fat adaptation for a period of at least 2-4 weeks has resulted in a nearly two-fold increase in resistance to fatigue during prolonged, low- to moderate-intensity cycling (&lt; 70% VO2, peak). Moreover, preliminary studies suggest that mean cycling 20 km time-trial performance following prolonged submaximal exercise is enhanced by 80 s after dietary fat adaptation and 3 days of carbohydrate loading. Thus the relative contribution of fuel substrate to prolonged endurance activity may be modified by training, pre-exercise feeding, habitual diet, or by artificially altering the hormonal milieu or the availability of circulating fuels. The time course and dose-response of these effects on maximizing the oxidative contribution of fat for exercise metabolism and in exercise performance have not been systematically studied during moderate- to high-intensity exercise in humans.",carbohydrate; lipid; triacylglycerol; athlete; carbohydrate diet; cycling; endurance; exercise; fatigue; human; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid oxidation; muscle metabolism; nutrition; review; training; Adipose Tissue; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Exercise; Fatigue; Fatty Acids; Glycogen; Humans; Oxidation-Reduction; Physical Endurance; Triglycerides
NA,"Endocrine disrupters, semen quality and anogenital distance",2019,NA,NA,"The literature on effects of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (organochlorine compounds, phthalates, perfluorinated alkylated substances [PFAS], and bisphenol A [BPA]) on anogenital distance (AGD) and semen quality will be reviewed and challenges discussed. Generally, AGD appears to be a promising, easily obtainable marker of male reproductive health. Maternal exposure to phthalates has been associated with shorter AGD in male offspring although not consistently, whereas too few studies on the effects of exposure to PFAS and BPA on AGD are found to draw firm conclusion. Meta-analyses suggest that adult phthalate exposure may affect semen quality, whereas the results for the effect of PFAS and BPA exposure on semen quality are contradictory. Interestingly, few studies suggest that maternal exposure to these chemicals may affect semen quality in the offspring. It is therefore important to conduct birth cohort studies focusing on the effect of exposures during vulnerable time windows. They should include biological material and focus on multiple exposures and have the necessary size and long-term follow-up with clinical examinations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",NA

The most promising and convenient methods of synthesis of these type compounds are based on co-pyrolysis reactions of low-basic polyfluoroaromatic amines with RCCl3 type derivatives and the interaction of such amines and polyfluoroaromatic hydrazines with RCX3 (XCl,F) compounds in the presence of AlCl3 at moderate temperature; they have no analogues in the nonfluorinated series. Reactions with different nucleophilic reagents, the formation of electrophilic intermediates of the nitrilium cation type and reactions of the latter with aromatic and fluoroaromatic hydrocarbons, amines, and compounds with CN, C≡N and CO multiple bonds are described. It is shown that polyfluoroaromatic compounds with a NCClR group are promising precursors for syntheses of a wide range of compounds of various classes, including heterocyclic derivatives. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between exposure to EDCs and obesity. Data sources, design and eligibility criteria PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched from inception to 6 June 2018 for studies primarily addressing the association between exposure to EDCs after the age of 2 years and anthropometric measures of obesity or body fat. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias. Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers screened and conducted data extraction and synthesis. A third reviewer resolved disagreements. Results A total of 73 studies investigating bisphenol A (32 286 individuals), organochlorine compounds (34 567 individuals), phthalates (21 401 individuals), polybrominated biphenyls (2937 individuals), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (5174 individuals), parabens (4097 individuals), benzoic acid (3671 individuals) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (349 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Most had a cross-sectional design and low or medium risk of bias. In qualitative analysis, bisphenol A and phthalates were consistently associated with general and abdominal obesity, in children and adults, and some studies suggested this association was age-dependent and gender-dependent. Meta-analysis indicated a significant association between exposure to bisphenol A and overweight (OR 1.254, 95% CI 1.005 to 1.564), obesity (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.273 to 1.774) and increased waist circumference (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.267 to 1.783) in adults, and between exposure to 2,5-dichlorophenol and obesity in children (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1018 to 3.184). Conclusion Most observational studies supported a positive association between obesity and exposure to EDCs. Although causality cannot be determined from these data, they underscore the need to limit human exposure to EDCs in light of the evidence from animal and cell-based studies indicating the effects of these chemicals on adiposity.

The data today report their presence in several cities in Europe, America, and Asia, showing that the problem is global. These substances enter the water cycle through sewage systems, and cities where wastewater treatment systems are insufficient could have higher levels of illicit drugs in tap water. Illicit drugs are also ubiquitous pollutants in the aquifers and pose a potential risk to health when people drink contaminated water for their whole life. Studies have been carried out to assess their potential effects on the environment and also on the population, but the limited information on potential effects at trace levels should not be overlooked. Every day new illicit substances, some even active at low concentrations such as fentanyls, are synthesized and put on the market with a total lack of toxicological information and are now detectable in drinking water.

Most cases are sporadic (>95% of cases) after the age of 65 years, implicating an important role of environmental factors in disease pathogenesis. Environmental neurotoxicants have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's Disease and AD. Animal models of AD and in vitro studies have shed light on potential neuropathological mechanisms, yet the biochemical and molecular underpinnings of AD-relevant environmental neurotoxicity remain poorly understood. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a potentially critical pathogenic target of environmentally induced neurotoxicity. BACE1 clearly has a critical role in AD pathophysiology: It is required for amyloid beta production and expression and activity of BACE1 are increased in the AD brain. Though the literature on BACE1 in response to environmental insults is limited, current studies, along with extensive AD neurobiology literature suggest that BACE1 deserves attention as an important neurotoxic target. Here, we critically review research on environmental neurotoxicants such as metals, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, polyfluoroalkyl substances, heterocyclic aromatic amines, advanced glycation end products, and acrolein that modulate BACE1 and potential mechanisms of action. Though more research is needed to clearly understand whether BACE1 is a critical mediator of AD-relevant neurotoxicity, available reports provide convincing evidence that BACE1 is altered by environmental risk factors associated with AD pathology, implying that BACE1 inhibition and its use as a biomarker should be considered in AD management and research. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","acrolein; advanced glycation end product; alkyl group; amyloid beta protein; aromatic amine; beta secretase 1; fungicide; herbicide; metal derivative; pesticide; aspartic proteinase; BACE1 protein, human; neurotoxin; secretase; aging; Alzheimer disease; environmental exposure; enzyme activity; human; in vitro study; mild cognitive impairment; neurobiology; neuropathology; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; protein expression; protein function; protein protein interaction; Review; risk factor; upregulation; adverse event; aged; animal; biosynthesis; brain; disease model; environmental exposure; enzymology; female; gene expression regulation; male; pathology; toxicity and intoxication; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Animals; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Environmental Exposure; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Humans; Male; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Neurotoxins"

In this study, the related published articles with sampling years from 2010 to 2020 were reviewed, and the concentration levels, composition characteristics and possible sources of PFASs in surface water (rivers and lakes) and precipitation in China were summarized, including those in the Tibetan Plateau region. The results show that the concentrations of PFASs in surface water in different areas of China vary greatly, ranging from 0.775 to 1.06 × 106 ng/L. The production processes of fluorinated manufacturing facilities (FMFs) and sewage discharge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPS) were the main sources of PFASs in surface water in China, and the concentrations of PFASs in water flowing through cities with high urbanization increased significantly compared with those before water flowed through cities with high urbanization. The compositions of PFASs in surface water gradually changed from long-chain PFASs, such as per-fluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA) and per-fluoro-octanesulfonic acid (PFOS) to short-chain PFASs, such as per-fluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), per-fluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and per-fluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA). The concentrations of PFASs in precipitation in China ranged from 4.2 to 191 ng/L, which were lower than those of surface water. The precipitation concentrations were relatively high around a fluorination factory and in areas with high urbanization levels. PFASs were detected in the surface water and precipitation in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is the global “roof of the world”, but the concentrations were low (0.115–6.34 ng/L and 0.115–1.24 ng/L, respectively). Local human activities and surface runoff were the main sources of PFASs in the surface water of the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, under the influence of the Southeast Asian monsoon in summers, marine aerosols from the Indian Ocean and air pollutants from human activities in Southeast Asia and South Asia will also enter the water bodies through dry and wet depositions. With the melting of glaciers caused by global warming, the concentration of PFASs in the surface water of the TP was higher than that before the melting of glaciers flowed into the surface water of the TP. Generally, this study summarized the existing research progress of PFAS studies on surface water and precipitation in China and identified the research gaps, which deepened the researchers’ understanding of this field and provided scientific support for related research in the future. The concentrations of PFASs in the water bodies after flowing through FMFs were significantly higher than those before water flowed through FMFs, so the discharge of the FMF production process was one of the main sources of PFASs in surface water. © 2022 by the authors.

Photocatalytic approaches have been widely studied for the effective removal of PFCs due to the mild operation conditions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date summary on the homogenous and heterogeneous photocatalytic processes for PFCs removal. Specifically, the homogenous photocatalytic methods for remediating PFCs are firstly discussed, including generation of hydrated electrons (eaq‒) and its performance and mechanisms for photo-reductive destruction of PFCs, the active species responsible for photo-oxidative degradation of PFCs and the corresponding mechanisms, and metal-ion-mediated (Fe(III) mainly used) processes for the remediation of PFCs. The influences of molecular structures of PFCs and water matrix, such as dissolved oxygen, humic acid, nitrate, chloride on the homogenous photocatalytic degradation of PFCs are also discussed. For heterogeneous photocatalytic processes, various semiconductor photocatalysts used for the decomposition of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are then discussed in terms of their specific properties benefiting photocatalytic performances. The preparation methods for optimizing the performance of photocatalysts are also overviewed. Moreover, the photo-oxidative and photo-reductive pathways are summarized for remediating PFOA in the presences of different semiconductor photocatalysts, including active species responsible for the degradation. We finally put forward several key perspectives for the photocatalytic removal of PFCs to promote its practical application in PFCs-containing wastewater treatment, including the treatment of PFCs degradation products such as fluoride ion, and the development of noble-metal free photocatalysts that could efficiently remove PFCs under solar light irradiation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Biochemistry; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Chlorine compounds; Degradation; Dissolved oxygen; Fluorine compounds; Metal ions; Molecular oxygen; Photocatalytic activity; Precious metals; Remediation; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Mild operation conditions; Photo catalytic degradation; Photo-catalytic removal; Photo-oxidative degradation; Photocatalytic performance; Photochemical decompositions; Semiconductor photocatalyst; Toxicological properties; Iron compounds; chloride; dissolved oxygen; humic acid; nitrate; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanoic acid; water; ferric ion; bioaccumulation; chemical pollutant; decomposition analysis; photochemistry; photodegradation; water pollution; decomposition; defluorination; human; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; photocatalysis; photochemistry; photooxidation; priority journal; Review; waste component removal; water contamination; humic substance; waste water; water pollution; Ferric Compounds; Humic Substances; Waste Water; Water Pollution

The goal of this work was to summarize the main physical-chemical, pharmacological and pharmacokinetic characteristics of EZM, as well as to describe the main analytical methodologies for the quantification of the drug. Methods described in the United States Pharmacopeia for EZM raw material and tablets were also presented. The drug has a large number of process-related impurities and degradation products and needs strict quality control of its impurities. Specific chiral methods for the evaluation of its chiral impurities are also a need for EZM. The main advantages and disadvantages of the compiled analytical methods were presented, as well as the limits of detection and quantitation. The fastest and most efficient methods were highlighted. Most methods for analyzing EZM used C8 or C18 stationary phases in gradient mode with binary mobile phases containing acetonitrile and an acidic buffer solution with ultraviolet detection. For analysis of EZM in biological matrices, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is generally employed using electron spray ionization in negative ionization mode using multiple reaction monitoring. Different methods in the literature evaluate a large number of impurities for EZM, however new stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography methods for the drug are still needed. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Degradation; Drug products; High performance liquid chromatography; Ionization of liquids; Mass spectrometry; Matrix algebra; Stereochemistry; Analytical methodology; Limits of detection and quantitation; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Multiple reaction monitoring; Pharmaceutical formulation; Process-related impurities; Ultra violet detection; United states pharmacopeias; Quality control; analytical method; degradation; drug; liquid chromatography; physicochemical property; sterol; ezetimibe; chemistry; drug formulation; high performance liquid chromatography; liquid chromatography; procedures; tablet manufacture; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Chromatography, Liquid; Drug Compounding; Ezetimibe; Tablets"

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) identified 24 PFASs of interest for further study and possible regulation. We examined 371 peer-reviewed studies published since 2001 to understand the occurrence and distribution of 24 priority PFASs in global surface waters and groundwater. We identified 77,541 and 16,246 data points for surface waters and groundwater, respectively, with total PFAS concentrations ranging from low pg/L to low mg/L levels. Most data were from Asia, Europe, and North America with some reports from Oceania. PFAS information from other geographic regions is lacking. PFASs levels are consistently higher in rivers and streams followed by lakes and reservoirs and then coastal and marine systems. When sufficient data were available, probabilistic environmental hazard assessments (PEHAs) were performed from environmental exposure distributions (EEDs) to identify potential exceedances of available guideline values for each compound by matrix, region, and aquatic system. Specifically, exceedances of USEPA drinking water lifetime health advisory levels were up to 74% for PFOS in groundwater from Oceania and 69% for PFOA in North American groundwater. Our findings support selection of environmentally relevant experimental treatment levels for future toxicology, ecotoxicology and bioaccumulation studies, and potable source water exposure investigations, while highlighting PFASs and major geographic locations requiring additional study and inclusion in global monitoring and surveillance campaigns. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biochemistry; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental regulations; Health hazards; Health risks; Potable water; Public health; Reservoirs (water); Risk assessment; Surface waters; Water quality; Drinking-water qualities; Environmental health; Hazard and risk assessments; Hazard Assessment; Military products; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Probabilistics; Surface water and groundwaters; United States environmental protection agency; Groundwater; drinking water; ground water; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; surface water; alkanesulfonic acid; drinking water; fluorocarbon; concentration (composition); drinking water; groundwater; hazard assessment; risk assessment; surfactant; water quality; Asia; bioaccumulation; ecotoxicology; environmental exposure; environmental health; environmental monitoring; environmental surveillance; Europe; experimental therapy; geography; health hazard; human; lake ecosystem; marine environment; nonhuman; North America; peer review; publication; Review; river ecosystem; water pollution; water supply; environmental health; water pollutant; United States; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Drinking Water; Environmental Health; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Groundwater; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The challenges for each pathway to produce “drop-in” fuels are covered. Currently “drop-in” fuel production cost is approximately 2 times (~5–6$/gallon) higher than fossil fuels (3$/gallon), especially with the use of 2nd generation feedstocks. The primary sources of cost with “drop-in” fuel production are feedstock cost (40–60% of the total production cost), syngas cleaning and conditioning to meet Fischer-Tropsch synthesis requirement (12–15% of the total production cost) and bio oil upgrading (14–18% of the total production cost) in the case of pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The most influential factors on the life cycle analysis (LCA) were biomass cultivation, harvesting, biomass pre-treatment, and transportation. Therefore, robust processes that can use local waste biomass are far more environmental and economically viable, especially as biofuel from second generation have a greater potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (50–100%) than first generation biofuels (50–90%) when land use changes are omitted in the LCA. The sustainability of biofuels is pre-dominantly dependant on the sustainability of the initial biomass, with 2nd generation feedstocks being more sustainable than 1st generation. Gasification-FTS is considered as the most promising technique for “drop-in” fuel production over pyrolysis and HTL due to its flexibility towards feedstock acceptance and the ability to produced high yields of liquid fuel together with other economically viable biofuels such as electricity and heat. Biochemical routes (i.e.fermentation) to “drop-in” fuels are still in their early development stages, and therefore require more studies and pilot-scale experiments in order to discover an economic and sustainable means of using these methods. © 2020",Bioconversion; Biofuels; Biomass; Costs; Economic analysis; Feedstocks; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Life cycle; Pyrolysis; Sustainable development; Conversion technology; Critical review; Economically viable; Fuel production; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Life cycle analysis; Life cycle assessment; Techno-Economic analysis; Total production cost; “drop-in” fuel; Drops

PFAS concentrations were compiled for WWTPs in the United States from peer-reviewed studies, technical reports, and original data. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) increased by an average of 6.0 ± 1.6 ng/L from the influents to the effluents of WWTPs, but perfluorosulfonic acid (PFOS) did not significantly change, indicating sorption to sludge is offset by biotransformation of precursor compounds. The occurrence of individual PFAS may vary temporally; for example, perfluoropentanoic acid correlated weakly with seasonal temperatures at a site in Virginia. Wastewater effluent PFOA concentrations decreased at a site in Nevada from 2012 to February 2020 but appeared to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. Effluent PFOA also declined nationally from 1999 to 2020 by ∼13% per year. Nevertheless, the national mean PFOA concentration was 8.4 ± 0.4 ng/L in data collected from 2013 to 2020 with outliers omitted, indicating persisting low-level occurrence.

NA,Evaluation of the association between persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and diabetes in epidemiological studies: A national toxicology program workshop review,2013,NA,NA,"Background: Diabetes is a major threat to public health in the United States and worldwide. Understanding the role of environmental chemicals in the development or progression of diabetes is an emerging issue in environmental health. Objective: We assessed the epidemiologic literature for evidence of associations between persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and type 2 diabetes. Methods: Using a PubMed search and reference lists from relevant studies or review articles, we identified 72 epidemiological studies that investigated associations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) with diabetes. We evaluated these studies for consistency, strengths and weaknesses of study design (including power and statistical methods), clinical diagnosis, exposure assessment, study population characteristics, and identification of data gaps and areas for future research. Conclusions: Heterogeneity of the studies precluded conducting a meta-analysis, but the overall evidence is sufficient for a positive association of some organochlorine POPs with type 2 diabetes. Collectively, these data are not sufficient to establish causality. Initial data mining revealed that the strongest positive correlation of diabetes with POPs occurred with organochlorine compounds, such as trans-nonachlor, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dioxins and dioxin-like chemicals. There is less indication of an association between other nonorganochlorine POPs, such as perfluoroalkyl acids and brominated compounds, and type 2 diabetes. Experimental data are needed to confirm the causality of these POPs, which will shed new light on the pathogenesis of diabetes. This new information should be considered by governmental bodies involved in the regulation of environmental contaminants.",NA

Major attention is paid to experimental and theoretical IR spectroscopy data. Differential thermal analysis, polarization microscopy, and X-ray diffraction data are also taken into account. A more detailed treatment is presented on IR spectrum simulation based on data about the conformational lability of molecules and their specific (H-bonding) intermolecular interactions. The first mechanism is responsible for the conformational type of polymorphism in LACs and for the structure of the latter in solid crystal (SC) and liquid crystal (LC) states and in isotropic liquids (ILs). The second mechanism complements the structure-forming aspect of polymorphism in carboxylates, which is due to a rearrangement of hydrogen bond systems in H-complexes during polymorphic transitions to the LC and IL states. Both mechanisms are reflected in IR absorption spectra. A more adequate interpretation is possible in order to explain the many spectral features associated with the structure of LAC polymorphs and their H-complexes if these mechanisms are taken into account. © 2004 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",aliphatic compound; alkoxybenzene derivative; biphenyl derivative; carboxylic acid derivative; cholesterol; hexane; calculation; chemical structure; conformational transition; crystal; differential scanning calorimetry; hydrogen bond; infrared radiation; infrared spectroscopy; molecular interaction; phase transition; review; X ray diffraction

Another important feature is to place current results into the context of previous observations.

Authors tend to provide only summary statistics in various forms, such as means and standard deviations, median and range, quartiles, 95% confidence intervals, and so on, rather than providing measurement data. Second, essentially all environmental and biomonitoring measurements have an underlying lognormal distribution, so certain published statistical characterizations may be inappropriate for comparisons. The aim of this study was to review and develop direct conversions of different descriptions of data into a standard format comprised of the geometric mean (GM) and the geometric standard deviation (GSD) and then demonstrate how, under the assumption of lognormal distribution, these parameters are used to answer questions of confidence intervals, exceedance levels, and statistical differences among distributions. A wide variety of real-world measurement data sets was reviewed, and it was demonstrated that these data sets are indeed of lognormal character, thus making them amenable to these methods.

Yet, many of these studies provided important mechanistic insights on the toxicant-induced testis injury and reproductive dysfunction, relevant to the biology of the testis and spermatogenesis. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that findings obtained from toxicant models are exceedingly helpful tools to unravel the biology of testis function in particular spermatogenesis, including specific cellular events associated with spermatid transport to support spermiogenesis and spermiation. In this review, we critically evaluate some recent data, focusing primarily on the molecular structure and role of microtubules in cellular function, illustrating the importance of toxicant models to unravel the biology of microtubule cytoskeleton in supporting spermatogenesis, well beyond information on toxicology.

There is a growing interest in the use of ketogenic supplements, including medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), to achieve intermittent ketosis without adhering to a strict ketogenic diet. MCT supplementation is an inexpensive and simple ketogenic intervention, proven to benefit both individuals with normal cognition and those suffering from mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and other cognitive disorders. The commonly accepted paradigm underlying MCT supplementation trials is that the benefits stem from ketogenesis and that MCT supplementation is safe. However, medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) may also exert effects in the brain directly. Moreover, MCFAs, long-chain fatty acids, and glucose participate in mutually intertwined metabolic pathways. Therefore, the metabolic effects must be considered if the desired procognitive effects require administering MCT in doses larger than 1 g/kg. This review summarizes currently available research on the procognitive effects of using MCTs as a supplement to regular feed/diet without concomitant reduction of carbohydrate intake and focuses on the revealed mechanisms linked to particular MCT metabolites (ketone bodies, MCFAs), highlighting open questions and potential considerations.

The globally comparable human serum concentrations of PFOA and characteristic dominance of PFOA with respect to other perfluorocarboxylate (PFCA) homologues indicate that exposure pathways of humans differ from those of wildlife, where perfluorononanoate (PFNA) is often the dominant homologue.

This is not fully explained by established risk factors. Concurrent, increasing exposure to antiandrogenic environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in fetal life may partially explain this trend. This systematic review assessed available evidence regarding the association between environmental EDC exposure and risk of testicular cancer (seminomas and nonseminomas). Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of English peer-reviewed literature published prior to December 14, 2020 in the databases PubMed and Embase® was performed. Among the 279 identified records, 19 were eligible for quality assessment and 10 for further meta-analysis. The completeness of reporting was high across papers, but over 50% were considered subject to potential risk of bias. Mean age at diagnosis was 31.9 years. None considered effects of EDC multipollutant mixtures. The meta-analyses showed that maternal exposure to combined EDCs was associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer in male offspring [summary risk ratios: 2.16, (95% CI:1.78-2.62), 1.93 (95% CI:1.49-2.48), and 2.78 (95% CI:2.27-3.41) for all, seminoma, and nonseminoma, respectively]. Similarly, high maternal exposures to grouped organochlorines and organohalogens were associated with higher risk of seminoma and nonseminoma in the offspring. Summary estimates related to postnatal adult male EDC exposures were inconsistent. Maternal, but not postnatal adult male, EDC exposures were consistently associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer, particularly risk of nonseminomas. However, the quality of studies was mixed, and considering the fields complexity, more prospective studies of prenatal EDC multipollutant mixture exposures and testicular cancer are needed. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

This systematic review aims to assess PFAS associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) concentrations in human populations. Method: We systematically searched four online databases, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library for relevant peer-reviewed English language articles published until July 2021. Additional relevant articles identified were also included in the search results. We categorised populations into adults (≥18 years old) and children. Primary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and LDL, HDL, TC, and TG concentrations in the serum, plasma, or whole blood; secondary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and the odds of lipid-related health outcomes. Quantitative synthesis was done by vote counting of the effect directions between concentrations of PFAS and lipids/health outcomes, repeated on articles with sample size >1000. Sign tests were performed to assess the statistical significance of the differences between positive and negative associations. Sensitivity analysis was performed by separating out articles with populations having high concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Quality was assessed with the STROBE checklist and NHBLI Study Quality Assessment Tool. Results: A total of 58 articles were included for review. There was evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with higher concentrations of LDL, HDL, and TC, particularly for PFOA-LDL, PFOA-TC, PFOS-TC, and PFNA-LDL. Associations between PFAS and TG tended to be negative, especially for perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). Associations between PFAS concentration and the odds of secondary outcomes generally supported a positive association between PFAS and cholesterol concentrations. Conclusion: We found evidence of associations between the concentrations of some PFAS-lipid pairs in human populations. Future research should be conducted on the less well-studied PFAS to explore their effects on human health and in regions where such studies are currently lacking.

In Germany it is currently being examined whether and for whom these tests should be paid for by statutory health insurance in the future. Objective: (I) Diagnostic properties of NIPTs for the detection of trisomy 13, 18 and 21, and (II) hypothetical calculation of the possible use of NIPTs in different groups. Methods: (I) Systematic search for primary literature and systematic reviews in MEDLINE and four other databases. Inclusion criteria: Studies in pregnant women; index test: NIPT using molecular genetic analysis of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood to determine the trisomy risk; reference test: cytogenetic diagnostics or postnatal clinical examination. (II) Exploratory search. Hypothetical calculations for (1) all pregnant women following the current procedure without NIPTs using the example of first-trimester screening (FTS), (2) application in pregnant women with an increased risk (e.g., after preceding FTS), and (3) application of NIPT in a population with and without an increased trisomy risk. Results: In the 22 studies included, sensitivity and specificity for trisomy 21 detection were 99.13% (95% CI: [97.39%; 99.72%]) and 99.95% (95% CI: [99.88%; 99.98%]). The possible influence of test failures was not considered in the calculations, and thus the sensitivity or specificity of NIPTs may have been overestimated. For the detection of trisomy 13 and 18, the sensitivity could not be robustly estimated. Discussion: In pregnant women with an increased risk, NIPT can probably reduce the number of invasive tests and thus the number of test-related miscarriages. © 2019, The Author(s).",DNA; clinical examination; cytogenetics; diagnostic test accuracy study; genetic analysis; human; Medline; molecular diagnosis; non invasive molecular genetic prenatal test; Review; screening; sensitivity and specificity; systematic review; trisomy 13; trisomy 18; trisomy 21

However, recently halodefluorination has undergone many developments. The reaction can be effected with a range of metal halide sources (including s-block, f-block, and pblock metals), and has been developed into a catalytic process. Furthermore, methods for monoselective halodefluorination in polyfluorocarbons have been developed, allowing exchange of only a single fluorine with a heavier halogen. The reaction has also found use in cascade processes, where the final product may not even contain a halide, but where the conversion of fluorine to a more reactive halogen is a pivotal reaction step in the cascade.

China is one of the countries with a high density of lakes in the world. Lakes play an important role in many aspects such as water supply, fisheries, and maintenance of ecosystem diversity. In addition, lakes are important sinks of POPs. The POPs in lake water can absorb and be utilized by aquatic organisms, which poses great risk to ecosystems and human health. Therefore, the distribution of POPs in lake water has an important impact on the surrounding ecosystem and human health. We collected 80 articles on the topic of POPs in Chinese lake water published from 2003 to February 2019. We collected and analyzed the published data of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDX), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated diphenyl ethers (PCDEs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and phthalate esters (PAEs). The POPs in Chinese lake water have been investigated in 49 lakes, involving 19 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China, mainly located in the eastern region (n=32), and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (n=14). There were fewer studies in the Qinghai-Xinjiang Lake District (n=3), and other areas. Among them, PAHs, HCHs and DDX were the most studied POPs. Their average concentrations of ΣPAHs, ΣHCHs, and ΣDDX in Chinese lake water were 360.0±433.8 ng/L (n=26), 12.8±23.5 ng/L (n=30), and 12.8±24.6 ng/L (n=24). The concentrations of POPs in water of eastern lakes were higher than those in lakes in other areas. Although the relative proportions of ΣPAHs, ΣHCHs and ΣDDX to the concentration of total pollutants did not change significantly before and after the year of 2010, their concentrations decreased, suggesting that the compliance with the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and the mitigation of PAHs were effective in China. The depth of water (overlying water and interstitial water), sampling location (the inlet and outlet of lakes and within the lakes) were important factors for concentrations of POPs in Chinese lake water. The concentrations of POPs in Chinese lake water were correlated with human activities such as agricultural farming, domestic sewage, industrial sewage, and docks, and the type of POPs and geographical location of the studied area. Based on the research data collected from a large number of published literatures, this review revealed the distribution characteristics of POPs in Chinese lake water, and provided a scientific basis for the control and mitigation of POPs in Chinese lakes. © 2020 by Journal of Lake Sciences.",Aquatic ecosystems; Aquatic organisms; Esters; Ethers; Health risks; Importance sampling; Lake pollution; Lakes; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Reservoirs (water); Sewage; Water supply; Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane; Distribution characteristics; Lake waters; Occurrence; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Organic pollutants

This drives activation of caspase-1 or caspase-11/4/5, which cleave gasdermin D, separating its N-terminal pore-forming domain (PFD) from the C-terminal repressor domain (RD). The PFD oligomerizes to form large pores in the membrane that drive swelling and membrane rupture. Gasdermin D is one of six (in humans) gasdermin family members; several other gasdermins have also been shown to form pores that cause pyroptosis after cleavage to activate their PFDs. One of these, gasdermin E, is activated by caspase-3 cleavage. We review our current understanding of pyroptosis as well as current knowledge of the gasdermin family. Caspase-1-programmed cell death observed in 1992 was later termed pyroptosis to differentiate it from the morphologically distinct apoptosis. The pyroptosis effector remained unknown until 2015 when gasdermin D was discovered as a cleavage target for caspase-1 and -11. The N terminus of gasdermin D is a PFD that permeabilizes the plasma membrane, simultaneously releasing mature IL-1β and driving cell swelling until membrane rupture. Membrane rupture disperses soluble cytosolic contents. Organelles and intracellular bacteria remain trapped within the torn but largely intact plasma membrane. This PIT promotes transfer of trapped bacteria to neutrophils. Other gasdermin superfamily proteins have homologous, PFDs. DFNA5, one member of this family, is activated by caspase-3, converting apoptosis into lytic cell death. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",caspase 11; gasdermin; gasdermin A; gasdermin B; gasdermin C; gasdermin D; gasdermin E; inflammasome; interleukin 18; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; membrane protein; protein DFNB59; unclassified drug; caspase; inflammasome; tumor protein; channel gating; crystal structure; cytokine release; human; immune response; immunopathology; infection; nonhuman; oligomerization; priority journal; protein cleavage; protein expression; protein family; protein function; pyroptosis; Review; signal transduction; animal; apoptosis; cell membrane; metabolism; physiology; pyroptosis; Animals; Apoptosis; Caspases; Cell Membrane; Humans; Inflammasomes; Neoplasm Proteins; Pyroptosis

Genome-wide analysis studies also point to a central role for complement in disease pathogenesis. Here we review the pathophysiologic events pertinent to the complement system that accompany meningococcal sepsis in humans. Meningococci use several, often redundant mechanisms to evade killing by human complement.

Therefore, the conversion of CO2 by hydrogenation into higher hydrocarbons through the modified Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) has become an important topic of current research and will be discussed in this review. In this process, CO2 is converted into carbon monoxide by the reverse water-gas-shift reaction, which subsequently follows the regular FTS pathway for hydrocarbon formation. Generally, the nature of the catalyst is the main factor significantly influencing product selectivity and activity. Thus, a detailed discussion will focus on recent developments in Fe-based, Co-based, and bimetallic catalysts in this review. Moreover, the effects of adding promoters such as K, Na, or Mn on the performance of catalysts concerning the selectivity of olefins and higher hydrocarbons are assessed.

Water Framework Directive mandating the establishment of Member States’ water resources monitoring, presence of hazardous contaminants in effluents, and perception of vulnerability of water distribution system to attacks, have spurred technical and economic interests. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – As alternative to traditional analyzers, chemosensors, operate according to physical principles, without sample collection (online), and are capable of supplying parameter values continuously and in real-time. Their low selectivity and stability issues have been overcome by technological developments. This review paper contains a comprehensive survey of existing and expected online monitoring technologies for measurement/detection of pollutants in water. Findings – The state-of-the-art in online water monitoring is presented. Application examples are reported. Monitoring costs will become a lesser part of a water utility budget due to the fact that automation and technological simplification will abate human cost factors, and reduce the complexity of laboratory procedures. Originality/value – An overview of applicable instrumentation, and forthcoming developments, is given. Technological development in this field is very rapid, and astonishing advances are anticipated in several areas (fingerprinting, optochemical sensors, biosensors, molecular techniques). Online monitoring is becoming an ever-important tool not only for compliance control or plant management purposes, but also as a useful approach to pollution control and reduction, minimizing the environmental impact of discharges. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",NA

NA,Exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances and allergic outcomes in children: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,NA,NA,"Background: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent organic pollutants and widespread throughout the environment. Although exposure to PFASs may contribute to the development of allergic diseases in children, evidence about this association remains inconclusive. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between PFASs exposure and allergic diseases in children based on current evidence. Methods: The databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched to identify all observational studies that examined the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of childhood allergic diseases. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of case-crossover studies, and a previously validated quality assessment framework was used for observational studies lacking control groups. Random-effects meta-analysis models were applied to pool odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: From an initial 94 articles (after duplicate removal), 13 studies through full-text assessment were included for quantitative assessment and descriptive synthesis. They are ten cohort studies, two cross-sectional studies, and one case-control study. The pooled estimates showed that perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was associated with eczema (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.80–0.99), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) with atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.01–1.58), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) with allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.13–1.56). However, no such significant associations were found for wheeze and asthma. Conclusions: The meta-analysis results suggest that PFASs exposure could potentially be associated with eczema, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis during childhood, but not with childhood asthma or wheeze.

The distribution of temperature affects the radiation flux of long-wave and short-wave, which in turn plays a significant role in the balance of global energy radiation budget. Therefore, understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of atmospheric temperature and its long-term variation comprehensively are essential for our research on weather forecast and climate change research. Presently, many ground-based and space borne sensors have been developed for temperature detection. Space borne sensors observe temperature by nadir viewing, occultation detection, or limb sounding. Space borne sensors have a high spatial and temporal resolution, which can provide sufficient data for scientific research. In this paper, seven foreign hyperspectral sensors (IMG, AIRS, IASI, HALOE, HALOE, TES, MIPAS, ACE-FTS) and domestic sensors (the series of FY and GF) are introduced in terms of parameters, performance, and application. These sensors acquire the information of atmospheric parameters through the radiation in infrared band. Occultation and limb observation are less affected by the underlying surface and have high vertical resolution and sensitivity, such as HALOE, MIPAS, ACE-FTS, TES, etc. So far, the accuracy of temperature products of nadir observation (AIRS and IASI) is less than 1K with a vertical direction of 1 km, and the accuracy of temperature products in the troposphere by TES limb observation can reach 0.5 K. All of them meet the requirement of Numerical Weather Prediction and can be used widely in weather forecasting and climate change research. The accuracy of temperature profiles of the Feng Yun series is comparable to that of IASI, but the spatial and temporal resolution are needed to be improved. The radiation transfer is the basis for trace gas inversion. Firstly, we introduced the radiation transfer equations of nadir viewing, occultation detection, or limb sounding. The radiation transfer process of limb observation is similar to that of occultation detection, in which line-of-sight reaching a down-looking sensor is entirely above the ground. Then, three retrieval methods (statistical regression, physical inversion, and artificial neural network inversion) of temperature profile are described in terms of principles, characteristics, and development history. The advantages and disadvantages of them are also compared. The statistical regression method is simple and efficient, but the accuracy is relatively lower, which is usually used as the a priori profiles for the physical algorithm. The accuracy of physical inversion is improved obviously, but the retrieval process of is complex and the a priori profiles are needed in physical inversion. The artificial neural network method can acquire the temperature profile accurately and efficiently, but a variety of samples are needed for training. Meanwhile, the key problems that the influence of the cloud, aerosol, and surface reflectivity on temperature retrieval are described, and the possible solutions are then given, respectively. The generation and propagation of error (smoothness, model parameter, and measurement error) in temperature retrieval are summarized. Finally, the problems existing in atmospheric temperature inversion are proposed. © 2021, Science Press.

The chemical contaminants quantified were evaluated according to Brazilian drinking-water standards, and Guideline Values were proposed for emerging pollutants using conservative endpoints from NOAEL and LOAEL available in literature. From 1351 articles evaluated, 15 reached the research goal. Seventy-seven parameters were quantified in Brazilian drinking water from underground, surface and rainwater sources. Soil composition, mining, sewage and agricultural activities were the main sources for the seven classes framed: pesticides, metals, organic, endocrine disruptors, drugs, personal care products and illicit drugs. Twenty-two parameters are listed in the current Brazilian drinking water quality standard and 54 are not. Water was not considered appropriate to drink due to cadmium, aluminum, iron, nickel, mercury, atrazine, propionaldehyde, beryllium, acetone and 17 α-ethinyl estradiol (carcinogenic).

Data synthesis: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) does not occur naturally but is present in the serum of most residents of industrialized countries (U.S. median, 4 ng/mL). Drinking water is the primary route of exposure in some populations, but exposure sources are not well understood. PFOA has been used to manufacture such products as Gore-Tex and Teflon. PFOA does not break down in the environment; the human half-life is estimated at about 3 years. PFOA is not metabolized in the body; it is not lipophilic. PFOA is not directly genotoxic; animal data indicate that it can cause several types of tumors and neonatal death and may have toxic effects on the immune, liver, and endocrine systems. Data on the human health effects of PFOA are sparse. There is relatively consistent evidence of modest positive associations with cholesterol and uric acid, although the magnitude of the cholesterol effect is inconsistent across different exposure levels. There is some but much less consistent evidence of a modest positive correlation with liver enzymes. Most findings come from cross-sectional studies, limiting conclusions. Two occupational cohort studies do not provide consistent evidence for chronic disease; both are limited by sample size and reliance on mortality data. Reproductive data have increased recently but are inconsistent, and any observed adverse effects are modest. Conclusions: Epidemiologic evidence remains limited, and to date data are insufficient to draw firm conclusions regarding the role of PFOA for any of the diseases of concern.",cholesterol; drinking water; perfluorooctanoic acid; sex hormone; uric acid; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular disease; cholesterol blood level; diabetes mellitus; environmental exposure; epidemiological data; genotoxicity; health hazard; human; immunotoxicity; liver toxicity; neoplasm; nonhuman; occupational exposure; priority journal; review; thyroid disease; uric acid blood level; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Diabetes Mellitus; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fetal Development; Fluorocarbons; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Humans; Immune System; Kidney; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Octanoic Acids; Reproduction; Uric Acid; Animalia

These compounds have been reported to cause adverse impacts on wildlife and human. However, compared to the studies on hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) whose sorption characteristics is reviewed in Part IV of this review series, information on PPCPs is very limited. Thus, a summary of recent research progress on PPCP sorption in soils or sediments is necessary to clarify research requirements and directions. Main features: We reviewed the research progress on PPCP sorption in soils or sediments highlighting PPCP sorption different from that of HOCs. Special function of humic substances (HSs) on PPCP behavior is summarized according to several features of PPCP-soil or sediment interaction. In addition, we discussed the behavior of xenobiotic chemicals in a three-phase system (dissolved organic matter (DOM)-mineral-water). The complexity of three-phase systems was also discussed. Results: Nonideal sorption of PPCPs in soils or sediments is generally reported, and PPCP sorption behavior is relatively a more complicated process compared to HOC sorption, such as the contribution of inorganic fractions, fast degradation and metabolite sorption, and species-specific sorption mechanism. Thus, mechanistic studies are urgently needed for a better understanding of their environmental risk and for pollution control. Discussion: Recent research progress on nonideal sorption has not been incorporated into fate modeling of xenobiotic chemicals. A major reason is the complexity of the three-phase system. First of all, lack of knowledge in describing DOM fractionation after adsorption by mineral particles is one of the major restrictions for an accurate prediction of xenobiotic chemical behavior in the presence of DOM. Secondly, no explicit mathematical relationship between HS chemical-physical properties, and their sorption characteristics has been proposed. Last but not least, nonlinear interactions could exponentially increase the complexity and uncertainties of environmental fate models for xenobiotics. Discussion on proper simplification of fate modeling in the framework of nonlinear interactions is still unavailable. Although the methodologies and concepts for studying HOC environmental fate could be adopted for PPCP study, their differences should be highly understood. Prediction of PPCP environmental behavior needs to combine contributions from various fractions of soils or sediments and the sorption of their metabolites and different species. Recommendations and perspectives: More detailed studies on PPCP sorption in separated soil or sediment fractions are needed in order to propose a model predicting PPCP sorption in soils or sediments based on soil or sediment properties. The information on sorption of PPCP metabolites and species and the competition between them is still not enough to be incorporated into any predictive models. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",cosmetic; drug; organic compound; dissolved organic matter; drug; endocrine disruptor; environmental risk; humic substance; hydrophobicity; metabolite; organic pollutant; pollution control; pollution effect; sorption; xenobiotics; chemistry; pollutant; review; sediment; Cosmetics; Environmental Pollutants; Geologic Sediments; Organic Chemicals; Pharmaceutical Preparations

Six agents were reviewed: Teflon; autologous fat; collagen; silicone microparticles; silicone microballoons, and pyrolytic carbon. Collagen was the most frequently reported agent and yielded a 1-year cure/improvement rate of 60-80%, but results worsened significantly with longer follow-up. Teflon has been used longer in the treatment of stress incontinence, but low long- and short-term success rates and reported complications such as particle migration have prevented its widespread acceptance. Autologous fat has been suggested as a natural injectable but its success rate has been disappointing. The injection of silicone microparticles is associated with a long-term success rate of about 70% in patients with intrinsic sphincter deficiency, and it can now be injected more easily without the need of urethroscopy. Silicone microballoons and pyrolytic carbon has recently been introduced into clinical practice with a short-term success rate of about 70%, but longer follow-up is needed. In conclusion, the long-term durability, cost-effectiveness, and some safety issues still have to be addressed by further clinical trials. Copyright © 2003 S.

This review deals with the synthesis and the polymerization of fluorostyrene bearing the fluorine atom(s) in α and/or β position, mainly. These syntheses involve different reactants such as α,α-difluoroethylbenzene, or aryl iodides and vinylidene fluoride, or styrene and fluorination agents for α-fluorostyrene and sodium 1,2-difluoroacetate, or triphenylphosphine, fluorotrichloromethane, zinc dust and a ketone for the β-fluorostyrene. Their homopolymerizations using different systems (mainly radical and cationic polymerization) and various processes (suspension, emulsion, bulk, or in solution) are also described. The second part reported several synthetic routes to obtain α,β- or β,β-difluorostyrene bearing different reactants such as vinyl zincic reagent (F2C=C(CF3)ZnX (X=Br or I)) and palladium catalysts. This review also describes the synthesis of α,β,β-trifluorostyrene functionalized by a halogen or an acid group, using mainly a cross-coupling reaction between perfluoroalkenylzinc reagent and aryl iodides in the presence of a palladium catalyst. The thermocyclodimerization of α,β,β-trifluorostyrene and the emulsion copolymerization of dimethylphosphonate-4-substitued-α,β,β-trifluorostyrene with α,β,β-trifluorostyrene are studied. Finally, the state of the art of synthesis and (co)polymerization of [(α,β,β-trifluorovinyl)oxy] benzene functionalized or not is described. The main method to obtain such monomer is based on a coupling reaction between functionalized phenate and 1,2-dibromo-tetrafluoroethane (BrCF2CF2Br) followed by a dehalogenation step. The homopolymerization realized by thermocyclodimerization involves fluoropolymers incorporating perfluorocyclobutane groups. These fluoropolymers lead to innovative applications such as membranes for fuel cells, microlithography, and optics.

Plant carbonsource (PCS) enhanced denitrification in constructed wetlands (CWs) for wastewater with low chemical oxygen demand to total nitrogen (COD/N) has been one of the most exciting research topics. This paper summarized the related studies with VOSviewer software and found that the major interests were denitrification performance and mechanism in CWs. This article mainly focused on the PCSs’ characteristics, denitrification rate, the influences of key environmental and operational parameters, surface morphology variation, microbial community structure, and denitrification genes. Engineering prospects and existing problems were also introduced. PCSs’ degradation consumes DO and creates favorable conditions for denitrification. The COD/N of wastewater should be maintained at 4–5 by adding PCSs, thus improving denitrification performance and reducing nitrous oxide emission. Aerobic degradation, anaerobic fermentation, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, and sulfate reduction processes may consume the carbon released by PCSs depending on the influent quality and environmental conditions. More attention should be paid to the reduction of greenhouse gases and emerging pollutants in CWs with PCSs. © 2022 by the authors.",carbon; constructed wetland; denitrification; gene; literature review; nitrous oxide; pollutant removal; wastewater; wastewater treatment

To mimic the capillary network, subpopulations of neonatal rat heart cells were cultured on a highly porous elastomer scaffold with a parallel array of channels perfused with culture medium. To mimic oxygen supply by haemoglobin, the culture medium was supplemented with a perfluorocarbon (PFC) emulsion. Constructs cultivated in the presence of PFC contained higher amounts of DNA and cardiac markers and had significantly better contractile properties than control constructs cultured without PFC. To induce synchronous contractions of cultured constructs, electrical signals mimicking those in native heart were applied. Over only 8 days of cultivation, electrical stimulation induced cell alignment and coupling, markedly increased the amplitude of synchronous construct contractions and resulted in a remarkable level of ultrastructural organization.

An FPP located in the Netherlands has historically used perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) for fluoropolymer production and is currently using GenX (HFPO-DA; 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)propionic acid) as a replacement. This study reviewed existing data from open access reports and peer reviewed publications on the environmental presence of PFOA and GenX in environmental matrices such as surface water, groundwater, soil and vegetation. Published data on human exposure to PFOA and GenX (i.e. via drinking water and food as well as blood monitoring) were reviewed in order to assess the influence of the FPP on contamination of the local population. Concentrations in environmental and human exposure samples were compared to (inter)national quality standards or risk limits. The data showed higher PFOA and GenX concentrations in surface water, groundwater, soil and vegetation samples taken close to point sources, and the highest observed concentrations exceeded these standards and limits (except for PFOA in soil). Drinking water and food also contained higher PFOA and GenX concentrations in samples taken close to point sources compared to samples further away. Tolerable daily intake (TDIs) for both PFASs were exceeded, however, only in a maximum exposure scenario. Blood monitoring of the local population near the FPP, and FPP workers, confirmed high exposure can occur as blood concentrations of several individuals exceeded the safe level.

NA,Breast cancer and persistent organic pollutants (excluding DDT): a systematic literature review,2016,NA,NA,"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a group of heterogeneous compounds of both natural and anthropogenic origin with highly persistent and bioaccumulative properties. They cause a range of adverse effects to human health and the environment around the world. There is growing concern that POPs may increase breast cancer risk due to their xenoestrogenic properties. The aim of this systematic literature review is to summarize and integrate the risks of breast cancer following environmental exposure to POPs (other than DDT) from primary epidemiological studies published between 2006 and 2015. After searching various databases, 14 case-control studies and one cohort study were included. Evidence of an association between increased breast cancer risk and environmental exposure to these chemicals is inconsistent and inadequate to conclude with certainty. However, most of the studies have examined exposure to the pollutants after diagnosis of breast cancer, overlooking exposure during critical windows of vulnerability. They have also largely focused on individual chemicals but ignored the combined effects of different chemicals. Therefore, major data gaps remain in examining exposure during critical windows of vulnerability and assessing combined effects of multiple chemicals. Development of better exposure assessment methods addressing these gaps is required for future research.",NA

Fluorinated greenhouse gases, or F-gases, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) have been termed “super pollutants” and “super greenhouse gases” given their severe and powerful impact on the climate. They are the most potent greenhouse gases known to modern science, with global warming potentials far greater than carbon dioxide, some up to almost 24,000 times more so. Troublingly, they are also the fastest growing class of greenhouse gas emissions around the world, especially in developing countries. Research suggest that almost 40% of their emissions by 2050 will fall outside the scope of international agreements such as the Paris Accord, Montreal Protocol and Kigali Amendment. Without comprehensive and sustained interventions, uncontrolled growth in F-gas emissions could offset all of the gains made by the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, or the cornerstone of existing international climate governance, the Nationally Determined Contributions of the 2015 Paris Accord. This review asks: What options are available to mitigate the environmental impacts of F-gases and thus make their manufacturing or disposal far more sustainable? What technical solutions and innovations exist to make their industrial usage low to zero carbon? What benefits will accrue from F-gas mitigation, and what barriers will need addressed? It undertakes a comprehensive and critical review of more than 140,000 sources of evidence, and a short list of 855 studies on the topic. It utilizes a sociotechnical lens that examines the manufacturing and use of F-gases across multiple sectors (including refrigeration, electronics manufacturing, non-ferrous metals processing, and applications in consumer goods) and components of its lifecycle (including not only manufacturing, but also use, disposal and destruction). We find that there are several policies and regulations that can be employed to address this already serious and growing climate change challenge. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Fluorocarbons; Gas emissions; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Manufacture; Pollution; Sulfur hexafluoride; Anthropogenic emissions; Climate mitigations; Decarbonisation; Fluorinated greenhouse gas; Fugitive emissions; Global warming potential; Greenhouses gas; High-global warming potential emission; Hydrofluorocarbon-23; Hydrofluorocarbons; Industrial decarbonization; Perfluorocarbons; Short lived climate pollutant; Synthetic greenhouse gas; Trace emission; Greenhouse gases

The very large number of CECs reported in the literature makes it difficult to interpret potential risks as well as the removal efficiencies, especially for the more recalci-trant compounds.

In an effort to develop such a list, five criteria were used to address the potential for applying indicator compounds; these criteria include usage, occurrence, resistance to treatment, persistence, and physicochemical properties that shed light on the potential degradability of a class of compounds. Additional constraints applied included the feasibility of procuring and analyzing compounds. In total, 22 CECs belonging to 13 groups were selected as indicator compounds. These compounds include acetaminophen and ibuprofen (analgesic); erythromycin, sulfamethox-azole, and trimethoprim (antibiotics); diazepam and fluoxetine (antidepressants); carbamazepine (antiepileptic); atenolol and propranolol (β-blockers); gemfibrozil (blood lipid regulator); tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP) (fire retardant); cotinine (nicotine metabolite); atrazine, metolachlor, and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) (pesticides); 17β-estradiol and cholesterol (steroids); caffeine (psychomotor stimulant); perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (surfactants); and iopromide (X-ray contrast agent). These thirteen groups of compounds represent CECs with the greatest resistance to treatment processes, most persistent in surface waters, and detected with significant frequency throughout the water cycle.

In the USA, the health sector accounts for 8.5% of total GHG emissions. The primary objective of this systematic review was to critically analyse the carbon emissions data from GI endoscopic activity. Design: The GI endoscopy carbon cycle was evaluated at preprocedural, intraprocedural and postprocedural levels. We performed a systematic literature search of articles published on these issues until 30 June 2022 and discussed these available data on endoscopy unit GHG carbon cycle, barriers to reduce GHG emissions and potential solutions. The inclusion criteria were any full-text articles (observational, clinical trials, brief communications, case series and editorials) reporting waste generation from GI endoscopy. Abstracts, news articles and conference proceedings were excluded. Results: Our search yielded 393 records in PubMed, 1708 in Embase and 24 in Google Scholar. After application of inclusion and exclusion factors, we focused on 9 fulllength articles in detail, only 3 of them were cross-sectional studies (all from the USA), the others reviews or position statements. Therefore, the quality of the studies could not be assessed due to heterogeneity in definitions and amount of emissions. Conclusions: Recognition of carbon emissions generated by GI endoscopy activity is critical. Although multiple limitations exists for quantification of these emission, there is an urgent need for collecting proper data as well as examining novel methods for reduction of these emissions for a sustainable endoscopic practices in the future. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

The current remediation technologies for PFOA and PFOS are primarily focused on physical and chemical techniques. Phytoremediation has provided promising alternatives to traditional cleanup technologies due to their low operational costs, low maintenance requirements, end-use value, and aesthetic nature. In this review, uptake, translocation, and toxic effects of PFOS and PFOA are summarized and discussed. Several potential hyperaccumulators of PFOS and PFOA are provided according to the existing data.

Low removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals by conventional wastewater treatment plants requests for a more efficient technology. Nowadays research on advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have become a hot topic, because these technologies have been shown to be able to oxidize efficiently most organic pollutants until mineralization to inorganic carbon (CO2). Among AOPs, the electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs), and in particular, ""anodic oxidation"" and ""electro-Fenton"", have demonstrated good prospective at lab-scale level for the abatement of pollution caused by the presence of residual pharmaceuticals in waters.

NA,Fate and effects of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the aquatic environment: A review,2014,NA,NA,"Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are distributed ubiquitously in the aquatic environment, which raises concern for the flora and fauna in hydrosystems. The present critical review focuses on the fate and adverse effects of PFASs in the aquatic environment. The PFASs are continuously emitted into the environment from point and nonpoint sources such as sewage treatment plants and atmospheric deposition, respectively. Although concentrations of single substances may be too low to cause adverse effects, their mixtures can be of significant environmental concern. The production of C8-based PFASs (i.e., perfluorooctane sulfonate [PFOS] and perfluorooctanoate [PFOA]) is largely phased out; however, the emissions of other PFASs, in particular short-chain PFASs and PFAS precursors, are increasing. The PFAS precursors can finally degrade to persistent degradation products, which are, in particular, perfluoroalkane sulfonates (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs). In the environment, PFSAs and PFCAs are subject to partitioning processes, whereby short-chain PFSAs and PFCAs are mainly distributed in the water phase, whereas long-chain PFSAs and PFCAs tend to bind to particles and have a substantial bioaccumulation potential. However, there are fundamental knowledge gaps about the interactive toxicity of PFAS precursors and their persistent degradation products but also interactions with other natural and anthropogenic stressors. Moreover, because of the continuous emission of PFASs, further information about their ecotoxicological potential among multiple generations, species interactions, and mixture toxicity seems fundamental to reliably assess the risks for PFASs to affect ecosystem structure and function in the aquatic environment. © 2014 SETAC.",NA

Most synthetic dyes have complex aromatic structures and are resistant to degrade by classical approaches, such as physical and chemical processes, including adsorption, chemical coagulation, flocculation, ion exchange, membrane separation, froth flotation, and reverse osmosis. Enzymes-assisted catalytic transformation of pollutants has become a potential alternative to classical methods because of their ability to react with complex compounds, a quick degradation rate, and producing less harmful by-products. Plant peroxidases, and microbial laccase and lignin-degrading peroxidases (manganese and lignin peroxidase) have gained significant attention for treating aromatic waste due to their capability of oxidizing and detoxifying a wide range of recalcitrant xenobiotics, including PAHs and synthetic dyes. Peroxidases being efficient biocatalysts detoxify an array of toxic compounds by simple free-radical mechanism resulting in the formation of oxidized and depolymerized products of significantly reduced toxicity. Moreover, it is an ecofriendly and economically favorable approach towards the biodegradation of recalcitrant and toxic industrial waste. Among microbial and plant peroxidases, bacterial enzymes have broad substrate specificity and can transform a wide range of recalcitrant substrates. Ligninolytic enzymes oxidize the aromatic ring into quinones and acids by producing free hydroxyl radicals instead of dihydrodiols and mineralize aromatic hydrocarbon in combination with cytochrome P450, monooxygenases, and epoxide hydrolases. In the review, an attempt has been made to provide detailed knowledge about the availability of inexpensive peroxidases sources, their mechanism of action, and degradation potential. The present review summarizes the exploitation of peroxidases from plants, bacteria, and fungus (manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase, and laccases) for detoxification and degradation of textile dyes as well as PAHs. Conclusively, peroxidases have great potential to react with almost all classes of synthetic dyes and most PAHs due to broad substrate specificity and transformed them into less harmful metabolites. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","bacterial protein; coloring agent; fungal protein; laccase; peroxidase; plant protein; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; bioremediation; catalysis; metabolism; waste disposal; Bacterial Proteins; Biodegradation, Environmental; Catalysis; Coloring Agents; Fungal Proteins; Laccase; Peroxidases; Plant Proteins; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Refuse Disposal"

The experienced synthetic chemist will probe many of these variables during reaction development and optimization, which will routinely involve investigation of reaction temperature, solvent, stoichiometry, concentration, time, choice of catalyst, addition sequence or quenching conditions just to name some commonly addressed variables. Remarkably, little attention is typically given to the choice of reaction vessel material as the surface of common laboratory borosilicate glassware is, incorrectly, assumed to be chemically inert. When reviewing the scientific literature, careful consideration of the vessel material is typically only given during the use of well-known glass-etching reagents such as HF, which is typically only handled in HF-resistant, polyfluorinated polymer vessels. However, there are examples of chemical transformations that do not involve such reagents but are still clearly influenced by the choice of reaction vessel material. In the following review, we wish to condense the most significant examples of vessel effects during chemical transformations as well as observations of container-dependent stability of certain molecules.

In the area of hydrolase-catalysed biotransformations, lipases have been used in dynamic kinetic resolutions of amines at low-temperature using radical-based racemisation methods. A system has also been developed for the lipase catalysed desymmetrisation of allenic diols. An unusual promiscuous activity of formate dehydrogenase has been described in which the enzyme catalysed a hydrolytic reaction. In reductase biotransformations, ene reductases of the Old Yellow Enzyme family have been applied to the asymmetric reduction of Baylis-Hillman adducts and also shown, in some cases, to catalyse oxazete formation in the transformation of nitro-alkenes. The carbon-carbon bond forming enzyme benzaldehyde lyase was reported to catalyse N-hydroxamic acid formation from benzaldehydes and nitrosobenzenes. An (R)-selective arylmalonate decarboxylase has been engineered either to act as a racemase or to catalyse decarooxylation with inverted enantioselectivity. New developments in oxidase biocatalysis include the application of flavin-dependent Bereberine Bridge Enzyme to the resolution of reticuline-like substrates through carbon-carbon bond formation. A Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase catalysed a dynamic kinetic resolution using racemic substrates susceptible to racemisation at alkaline pH. Cytochromes P450 have been applied to the oxidation of gaseous alkanes including methane, in the presence of perfluoro alkanoic acids. The peroxygenase AaeAPO has been used to catalyse hydroxylation and epoxidation reactions in photobiocatalytic systems.

Design: Randomized, controlled study. Setting: Animal laboratory and pathology laboratories of a university hospital. Subjects: Fourteen healthy adult sheep, weighing 64.9 ± 6.4 kg. Interventions: Lung injury was induced with oleic acid (0.15 mL/kg). A tracheostomy tube was inserted, along with systemic and pulmonary artery monitoring catheters. Animals were randomized to undergo either partial liquid ventilation (n = 7) or gas ventilation (n = 7). Animals underwent euthanasia at the end of the 90-min study period, after which the endotracheal tube was clamped with the lungs in expiratory hold at a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O. En bloc excision of the heart and lungs was performed by thoracotomy. Perfusion of the isolated lung vasculature with 2.5% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in a 0.1-M phosphate buffer was performed. Histologic analysis followed. Measurements and Main Results: Gas exchange increased markedly in the animals that underwent partial liquid ventilation compared with the gas-ventilated animals (Pao2 at 90 mins: gas ventilation-treatment group, 40 ± 8 torr [5.3 ± 1.1 kPa]; partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, 108 ± 60 torr [14.4 ± 8.0 kPa]; p = .004). Lung histologic analysis demonstrated a better overall diffuse alveolar damage score (partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, 12.4 ± 1.4; gas ventilation-treatment group, 15.0 ± 1.7; p = .01). In the partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, we observed an increase in mean alveolar diameter (partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, 82.4 ± 2.9 μm; gas ventilation-treatment group, 67.7 ± 3.9 μm; p = .0022) and a decrease in the number of alveoli per high-power field (partial liquid ventilation- treatment group, 25.7 ± 0.9, gas ventilation-treatment group, 31.4 ± 2.5; p = .0022), in septal wall thickness (partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, 6.0 ± 0.6 μm; gas ventilation-treatment group, 8.3 ± 1.0 μm; p = .0033), and in mean capillary diameter (partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, 13.0 ± 0.8 μm; gas ventilation-treatment group, 19.9 ± 1.4 μm; p = .0022). Conclusions: Partial liquid ventilation is associated with notable improvement in gas exchange and with a reduction in the histologic and morphologic changes observed in an oleic acid model of acute lung injury.","fluorocarbon; oleic acid; perfluorooctyl bromide; acute respiratory failure; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; arterial oxygen tension; controlled study; liquid ventilation; lung gas exchange; lung injury; morphometrics; nonhuman; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; review; sheep; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Fluorocarbons; Hemodynamic Processes; Lung; Microscopy, Electron; Oleic Acid; Pulmonary Gas Exchange; Pulmonary Ventilation; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Insufficiency; Sheep"

They often collect in wastewater systems with virtually no degradation prior to environmental discharge. Some PFAS partitions to solids captured in wastewater treatment which require further processing. Of all the commonly applied solids treatment technologies, incineration offers the only possibility to completely destroy PFAS. Little is known about the fate of PFAS through incineration, in particular, for the systems employed in water resource recovery facilities (WRRF). This review covers available research on the fate of PFAS through incineration systems with a focus on sewage sludge incinerators. This research indicates that at least some PFAS destruction will occur with incineration approaches used at WRRFs. Furthermore, PFAS in flue gas, ash, or water streams used for incinerator pollution control may be undetectable. Future research involving full-scale fate studies will provide insight on the efficacy of PFAS destruction through incineration and whether other compounds of concern are generated. Practitioner points: Thermal processing is the only commercial approach available to destroy PFAS. Thermal degradation conditions required for destruction of PFAS during incineration processes are discussed. Fate of PFAS through water resource recovery facility incineration technologies remains unclear.

While considering pollutant removal, both techniques have their own merits and demerits. Microalgal-based methods have been dominantly used as a biological method for pollutant removal. The main limitations of microalgal methods are capacity, scale, dependence on variables of environment and duration of the process. Biopolymers on the other hand are naturally produced, abundant in nature, environmentally safe and biocompatible with cells and many times biodegradable. Algal immobilization in biopolymers has promoted the reuse of cells for further treatment and protected cells from toxic environment monitoring and controlling the external factors like pH, temperature and salinity can promote the removal process while working with the mentioned technologies. In this review, a mechanistic view of both these techniques along with integrated approaches emphasizing on their loopholes and possibilities of improvement in these techniques is represented. In addition to these, the review also discusses the post-treatment effect on algal cells which are specifically dependent on pollutant type and their concentration. All these insights will aid in developing integrated solutions to improve removal efficiencies in an environmentally safe and cost-effective manner. Novelty statement The main objective of this review is to thoroughly understand the role of micro-algal cells and synthetic adsorbents individually as well as their integrative effect in the removal of pollutants from wastewater. Many reviews have been published containing information related to either removal mechanism by algae or synthetic adsorbents. While in this review we have discussed the agents, algae and synthetic adsorbents along with their limitations and explained how these limitations can be overcome with the integration of both the moieties together in process of immobilization. We have covered both the analytical and mechanistic parts of these technologies. Along with this, the post-treatment effects on algae have been discussed which can give us a critical understanding of algal response to pollutants and by-products obtained after treatment.

Besides conventional strategies, i.e., nucleophilic and electrophilic alkynylation, SOMOphilic alkynylation has become one of the most straightforward and powerful methods to construct C(sp)-C bonds. This review focuses on the recent developments in the transformations of acetylenic sulfones through a well-known radical addition ensuring C-SO2 bond cleavage relay (α-addition-β-elimination process), where acetylenic sulfones serve as either mono- or multi-functional reagents. In this regard, acetylenic sulfones can directly react with diverse alkyl radical species for the preparation of synthetically useful internal alkynes. On the other hand, acetylenic sulfones undergo a sequence of radical relays including hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), rearrangement, cyclization, SO2 capture, etc. for the simultaneous incorporation of alkynyl and other functionalities. Considering the different reaction modes, these contents employing acetylenic sulfones as functional reagents are divided into four sections: (1) direct alkynylation with various C-centered radicals; (2) alkynylation and fluoroalkylation; (3) alkynylation and sulfonylation; and (4) alkynylation and in situ SO2 capture.

It was developed in Russia as an oxygen-carrying intravenous plasma additive for hemorrhagic anemia and ischemic conditions from various etiologies. It was approved for clinical use in Russia in 1996 and used by the Russian Armed Forces and in civilian medical care. It was also approved in Mexico from 2005 to 2010. It has been reportedly administered to over 35,000 patients with significant evidence of benefit and relatively mild and manageable adverse effects. It may have significant potential for use in hemorrhagic shock if human red blood cells are not available, and for several other applications including treatment of vascular gas embolism, cerebral or spinal trauma, and regional ischemia. It is different from other perfluorocarbon preparations under development in the United States in that it uses a different primary perfluorocarbon (perfluorodecalin) and a surfactant (Proxanol 268) instead of egg-yok phospholipid as the emulsion vehicle. Perftoran has a much smaller particle size resulting in milder adverse effects. It has been safely administered to more patients than any oxygen carrier currently under development. A newly formed United States Corporation (FluorO2 Therapeutics, Inc.) intends to manufacture the product in the United States under GMP standards and make it available for clinical use in Mexico and Latin America and pursue research to support eventual approval in the United States for human and veterinary use.

DGVMs are designed to simulate the structural and functional responses of global vegetation to changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 concentration with the coexistence of plant functional types (PFTs). PFTs are groups of plant species with similar functions based on morphological, physiological, biochemical, reproductive, and demographic characteristics. DGVMs typically assign each PFT with fixed parameters representing the above characteristics, consequently ignoring their variations within PFT and their responses to environmental changes. This parameterization scheme can simplify plant species represented in DGVMs but inevitably result in large uncertainties in model predictions on ecosystem processes. Therefore, a new generation of DGVMs are urgently needed to overcome the limitations of PFTs by replacing the PFTs parameterization scheme with continuous variation in plant functional traits. Plant functional traits (FTs) are defined as morphological, physiological, and phenological characteristics that affect plants via their effects on the growth, reproduction, and survival. Plant FTs that mediate the structure and function of ecosystems can be implemented into DGVMs as variables rather than PFT-specific parameters with fixed values. The plant FT scheme not only provides a widely applicable approach for forecasting ecosystem shifts and changes in ecosystem structure, but can also be linked with ecosystem functions under a changing climate. This holds great potentials for predicting possible responses of terrestrial ecosystems to environmental changes. This review first introduces the state-of-the-art DGVMs based on PFTs. PFTs represent most of the world's vegetation types and characteristics through their functional behaviors and attributes. Although PFT-based DGVMs play a pivotal role in simulating atmosphere-land interactions by quantifying the processes of global carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles, uncertainties arise from inadequate PFT parameters and incomplete PFT classification. For example, many traits vary more within PFTs than between PFTs. Moreover, the values assigned to different PFTs often do not differ much-so little is gained (and much uncertainty is added) compared to a generic model where all plants behave identically. This paper also reviews the recent progress in plant FTs for developing new generations of DGVMs, which includes: (1) descripting adaption strategies of plants to the changing environment, (2) revealing the mechanisms of coexistence between plant species, (3) highlighting the close relationship with the structures and processes of ecosystems, and (4) summarizing their application in the parameterization of vegetation models. We also summarize the main approaches to improve current or build new DGVMs based on FTs, such as building a transitional framework for a PFT-FT hybrid DGVM and building a completely FT-based DGVM. Based on those discussions, several future research directions are recommended for developing a new-generation DGVMs, such as improving the prediction power of traits within the PFTs, building the mechanism expressions between plant adaptations and environments, and standardizing of the data sharing for FTs. We argue that constructing next generation of DGVMs is not simply a matter of incorporating trait-climate relationships, but more importantly to combine optimality concepts and classical vegetation dynamic theories making vegetation modelling more reliable and robust. Botanists, geographers, vegetation modelers, and other relevant scientists should cooperate and share the trait data to elucidate the huge potential of plant FTs in constructing the next generation of more reliable, robust and realistic DGVMs. We hope this review will promote the developments and applications of new generation DGVMs in China. © 2018, Science Press.

However, only small number of studies can be found in the literature due to the major drawbacks associated with the GC determination of PFCAs such as high detection limits, a small range of analytes, long analysis time, and laborious derivatization prior to chromatographic separation. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS2) can overcome these limitations of GC, and therefore has become the method of choice for the determination of PFCAs since 2001. Nevertheless, GC as a low-cost and commonly available analytical technique should not be ignored because of its inherent advantage over LC to identify PFCA isomers in environmental and biological matrices owing to its high-resolution power. In addition, GC provides an opportunity to crosscheck LC–MS2 results that are often suspicious due to background contamination. This tutorial provides an overview of GC methods that have been used for the determination of PFCAs after derivatization. Moreover, performance characteristics of GC–MS are compared with that of LC–MS2. PFCAs in aqueous samples were determined by both analytical techniques, and two sets of measurements were compared using the Bland-Altman plot. For both methods, reasons for false-positive and false-negative results (overestimation and underestimation of the PFCA concentration, respectively) are discussed, and accordingly some advice is offered on how to avoid erroneous results. Finally, major applications of GC and its future perspectives for the determination of PFCAs are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Effluents; Isomers; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Phase separation; Bland-altman plots; Chromatographic separations; False positive and false negatives; Gas-chromatographic determination; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Perfluorocarboxylic acid; PFOA; Solid-phase extraction; Gas chromatography; acetic acid ethyl ester; carboxylic acid derivative; dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; formic acid derivative; hydrofluoric acid; isobutylchloroformic acid; n,n bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide; perfluorocarboxylic acid derivative; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorophosphinic acid derivative; propyl chloroformic acid; trifluoroacetamide derivative; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; water; aqueous solution; concentration (parameters); derivatization; false negative result; false positive result; high performance liquid chromatography; human; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography; mass fragmentography; measurement repeatability; microwave emission detector; microwave radiation; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; solid phase extraction; solid phase microextraction; tandem mass spectrometry; analysis; gas chromatography; water pollutant; Chromatography, Gas; Chromatography, Liquid; Fluorocarbons; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Conventionally, the carboxylative cyclization comprises CO2 capture and subsequent nucleophilic attack of the resulting carboxylic anion to an unsaturated bond, by which the monofunctionalization of the unsaturated bond is realized and the heterocyclic compounds, such as 5-/6-membered cyclolactone, cyclocarbonate, and oxazolidinone, are accordingly generated. Nowadays, the CO2-participated multicomponent carboxylative cyclizations have evoked intense interest due to their ability to perform the bifunctionalization of the unsaturated bond in the ring-closing step, thus assembling complex molecules. Up to now, by activating the unsaturated bonds with functionalized reagents and designing cascade reactions of organometallic compounds, substituents including iodine, trifluoromethyl, perfluoroalkyl, alkyl, cyanoalkyl, allyl, aryl, phenoxy, allenyl, selenyl, amino, and phosphonyl groups have been incorporated into the cyclocarbonate or oxazolidinone compounds successfully through the multicomponent carboxylative cyclizations. Given the tremendous utility of this synthetic strategy in heterocyclic compound synthesis, this review summarizes the progress of multicomponent carboxylative cyclizations to spur the further development of this field.

We aimed to examine the utility of flow cytometric platelet aggregation (FCA) assay in detecting platelet function defects (PFDs) in patients with a history of bleeding symptoms. Methods Sixty-four participants (24 patients and 40 healthy controls) were included in this study. LTA and FCA assay were performed simultaneously in patients and healthy controls. In the FCA assay, two portions of platelets from the same individual were labeled separately with CD31-FITC and CD31-PE. After mixing and stimulation with agonists, the double-colored platelet aggregates were visualized using a flow cytometer. The results generated using the two techniques were compared and correlated. Results The patients’ median age was 17 years (range, 3-72 yr) with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.7. There was substantial agreement between LTA and FCA assay in detecting a PFD (K=0.792). Four patients showing a Glanzmann thrombasthenia-like pattern on LTA exhibited an abnormal FCA. A functional defect in collagen binding was detected on the FCA assay conducted in two immune thrombocytopenic patients with severe bleeding. Conclusion FCA assay can be used to identify functional defects in platelets, with potential applications in thrombocytopenic individuals. It also facilitates the diagnosis of inherited bleeding disorders with platelet defects. © 2021 Korean Society of Hematology.",alphaIIbeta3 receptor; beta3 integrin; collagen; fibrinogen; fibrinogen receptor; fluorescein isothiocyanate; glycoprotein Ib alpha; hemoglobin; membrane protein; platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; ristocetin; thrombin receptor activating peptide; unclassified drug; urea; von Willebrand factor; activated partial thromboplastin time; adolescent; adult; aged; autoimmune thrombocytopenia; bleeding; blood sampling; blood transfusion; brain hemorrhage; central nervous system; child; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; demography; epistaxis; female; fibrinogen blood level; flow cytometric platelet aggregation test; flow cytometry; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; Glanzmann disease; hemoglobin blood level; human; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; leukocyte count; light transmission aggregometry; male; menorrhagia; muscle hematoma; operative blood loss; oral bleeding; platelet aggregation assay; platelet count; protein binding; prothrombin time; Review; thrombocyte aggregation; thrombocyte dysfunction; thrombocyte function; thrombocyte membrane; thrombocytopenia

This paper synthesises literature about the status of the pollutants and their precursors, identifies knowledge gaps and discusses future perspectives on the study of PFASs in Africa. Limited data on PFASs prevalence in Africa is available because there is limited capacity to monitor PFASs in African laboratories. The levels of PFASs in Africa are higher in samples from urban and industrialized areas compared to rural areas. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are the dominant PFASs in human samples from Africa. Levels of PFOS and PFOA in these samples are lower than or comparable to those from industrialized countries. PFOA and PFOS levels in drinking water in Africa are, in some cases, higher than the EPA drinking water guidelines suggesting potential risk to humans. The levels of PFASs in birds' eggs from South Africa are higher, while those in other environmental media from Africa are lower or comparable to those from industrialized countries. Diet influences the pollutant levels in fish, while size and sex affect their accumulation in crocodiles. No bioaccumulation of PFASs in aquatic systems in Africa could be confirmed due to small sample sizes. Reported sources of PFASs in Africa include municipal landfills, inefficient wastewater treatment plants, consumer products containing PFASs, industrial wastewater and urban runoff. Relevant stakeholders need to take serious action to identify and deal with the salient sources of PFASs on the African continent. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biochemistry; Consumer products; Environmental Protection Agency; Organic pollutants; Potable water; Sewage; Wastewater treatment; Adverse health effects; Environmental levels; Industrial wastewaters; Industrialized countries; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Wastewater treatment plants; Industrial water treatment; drinking water; organic compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; bioaccumulation; critical analysis; drinking water; landfill; organic pollutant; organofluorine; pollution monitoring; wastewater treatment plant; Africa; ambient air; aquatic environment; body burden; developed country; diet; environmental monitoring; fish; human; nonhuman; pollutant; prevalence; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; rural area; sediment; sludge; urban area; urban rural difference; waste management; wildlife; animal; body burden; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; pollutant; South Africa; waste water; water pollutant; South Africa; Aves; Crocodylidae (all crocodiles); Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Body Burden; Caprylates; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; South Africa; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Three-dimensional (3D) modeling shows that the actual current density in OLEDs based on materials with a Gaussian electron and hole DOS is filamentary. However, it is possible to accurately calculate the average current density by solving a one-dimensional (1D) drift-diffusion equation, making use of compact expressions for the temperature, electric field, and carrier density dependent mobility which have been derived from 3D-modeling. For the cases of spatially uncorrelated energetic disorder and spatially correlated disorder due to random dipole fields, these models are called the extended Gaussian disorder model (EGDM) and extended correlated disorder model (ECDM), respectively. We discuss how the effects of trapping on guest molecules can be included, and how exciton generation is described. The application of these models to hole and electron transporting polymer and small molecule materials is discussed, with an emphasis on the modeling of the transport and emission of blue-emitting OLEDs based on a polyfluorene-derivative.

Due to the lack of functional groups of the hydrocarbons, enantiorecognition in the presence of cyclodextrins is ascribed to weak van der Waals forces. Thermodynamic parameters of enantiorecognition between four chiral alkanes and octakis(6- O -methyl-2,3-di- O -pentyl)- g -cyclodextrin (Lipodex G) have been determined. The possible role of molecular inclusion is indicated by the complete loss of enantioselectivity when the cyclodextrins are replaced by the corresponding linear dextrins. The substitution pattern and cavity size of the modi fi ed cyclodextrins have a pronounced effect on the degree of enantiorecognition observed.

Many recall the famous experiments from Clark et al. in 1966 when he demonstrated 'liquidventilation with Perfluorocarbons' in the mammal species for the first time. After this hallmark, perfluorocarbons were subsequently introduced in research of acute lung injury by the techniques of Total- and Partial-Liquid- Ventilation (TLV; PLV). Perfluorocarbons (saturated organofluorids) have unique chemical and physical properties which made them attractive substances for intraalveolar application. The strong C-F bindings in the perfluorocarbon molecules are responsible for their chemical stability, biochemical inertness, high capacity to dissolve respiratory gases, low surface tension and high vapor pressures. Furthermore, the high density of the PFC lead to radio-opacity and their distribution to dependent lung areas. The efficacy of PFC liquid, applied by TLV/PLV has been demonstrated in numerous animal studies using different models of acute lung injury. Currently, several mechanisms of action of perfluorocarbon fluids in acute lung injury are discussed: recruitment of atelectatic alveoli, prevention of endexpiratory collapse of alveoli ('liquid PEEP'), redistribution of perfusion, oxygen transport, surfactant like effects and decrease of inflammation. Since total liquid ventilation has been used only in experimental models of lung injury, partial liquid ventilation has been introduced successfully into clinical trials (phase I-II). However, the results of the first randomised, controlled study of PLV in 90 adult patients suffering from severe respiratory failure (ALI/ARDS) showed no differences between PLV and conventional treatment. Furthermore, the instillation of relatively large amounts of liquid into the lungs poses several technical challenges and may be associated with complications such as liquithoraces, pneumothoraces and hypoxia. Since mammal lungs are evolutionary specialised to gas exchange using atmospheric oxygen, the application of liquids, even if they transport respiratory gases very well is not physiologic. To overcome these unwanted side effects, we developed a technique of perfluorocarbon vaporisation in analogy to the application of inhalation anaesthetic agents. After resolving some technical issues, this application technique was used successfully in an animal model of acute lung injury. Vaporisation of perfluorohexane in a concentration of 18 Vol.% of inspired gas improved significantly oxygenation and lung compliance. Though these results are promising, mechanisms of action, dose- efficacy relation, surfactant-perfluorocarbon interaction or anti- inflammatory effects of vaporised perfluorohexane are still unclear. These questions need to be clarified before this technique can be applied clinically. However, the inhalation of vapor, a technique already familiar to anaesthesiologists should avoid risks of large amounts of fluids in the bronchoalveolar space. Furthermore, this technique can be administered by established anaesthetic equipment with the advantage of exact dosing, continuous monitoring, and demand application in a way near to clinical routine.","fluorocarbon; hexane; isoflurane; fluorocarbon; inhalation anesthetic agent; isoflurane; perflexane; adult respiratory distress syndrome; drug efficacy; gas exchange; human; hypoxia; lung alveolus macrophage; lung collapse; lung injury; oxygen transport; review; surface tension; vaporization; adult respiratory distress syndrome; artificial ventilation; Anesthetics, Inhalation; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Isoflurane; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult"

Bacterial tubulin (FtsZ), actin (MreB), and intermediate filament (IF) proteins are key elements in cell division, chromosome and plasmid segregation, and maintenance of proper cell shape, as well as in maintenance of cell polarity and assembly of intracellular organelle-like structures. Although similar tasks are performed by eukaryotic cytoskeletal elements, the individual functions of FtsZ, MreBs, and IFs are different from those performed by their eukaryotic orthologs, revealing a striking evolutional plasticity of cytoskeletal proteins. However, similar to the functions of their eukaryotic counterparts, the functions conferred by bacterial cytoskeletal proteins are driven by their ability to form dynamic filamentous structures. Therefore, the cytoskeleton was a prokaryotic invention, and additional bacteria-specific cytoskeletal elements, such as fibril and MinD-type ATPases, that confer various functions in cell morphology and during the cell cycle have been observed in prokaryotes. The investigation of these elements will give fundamental information for all types of cells and can reveal the molecular mode of action of cytoskeletal, filament-forming proteins.

The risk of pneumonia, and risk of death is significantly greater for patients with high injuries. In cases of cervical SCI, mortality reaches 20% and respiratory morbidity - 100%. Among the most common complications are atelectasis, pneumonia and pulmonary embolism. Paralysis of respiratory muscles leads to hypoventilation, sputum retention and atelectasis resulting in respiratory insufficiency. Since the SCI is frequently associated with craniocerebral trauma, unconscious and uncooperative patients cannot actively cooperate and are especially prone to pulmonary complications. High cervical SCI (C1-C3) is followed by complete paralysis of respiratory muscles and lifetime ventilator dependence. Diaphragmatic nerve stimulators may sometimes restore diaphragmatic function but the availability of this method is limited. In tetraplegic patients with diaphragm paralysis, respiratory movements are caused by contraction of the sternocleidomastoid and interscalene muscles which can raise the upper part of the chest wall only. Spastic paresis of the chest wall and abdominal muscles prevents retraction of the chest wall during inspiration. Medium cervical SCI (C3-C5) is followed by transient respiratory insufficiency; some patients being weaned from the ventilator after spinal cord oedema regression and restoration of respiratory muscle function. In cases of lower cervical SCI (C6-C8), diaphragmatic and inspiratory neck muscle function is preserved. Intercostal and abdominal muscles are paralyzed, making active expiration impossible. Respiratory complications after thoracic SCI are caused more by the associated chest trauma than by the paralysis of the respiratory muscles. Coughing is usually preserved in such cases. Other respiratory complications include aspiration, bronchial hyperactivity and cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. In some tetraplegic patients, sleep apnoea may occur. The majority of patients with SCI require intubation. In patients with CSCI above C5 and complete quadriplegia, intubation should be offered routinely and early because delays may cause preventable morbidity. © PTAiIT, Borgis.",heparin; low molecular weight heparin; abdominal wall musculature; artificial ventilation; aspiration; atelectasis; breathing muscle; bronchus hyperreactivity; cervical spinal cord injury; coughing; diaphragm paralysis; disease association; frequency analysis; head injury; human; hypoventilation; lifespan; lung edema; lung embolism; morbidity; mortality; muscle function; nerve stimulation; pathophysiology; phrenic nerve; pneumonia; protective clothing; quadriplegia; respiratory failure; review; sleep apnea syndrome; spastic paresis; spinal cord injury; spirometry; sputum; sternocleidomastoid muscle; thorax wall; unconsciousness; weaning

Aspects of the bioaccumulation potential of IOCs in fish that can be characterized relatively well include the pH dependence of gill uptake and elimination, uptake in the gut, and sorption to phospholipids (membrane–water partitioning). Key challenges include the lack of empirical data for biotransformation and binding in plasma. Fish possess a diverse array of proteins that may transport IOCs across cell membranes. Except in a few cases, however, the significance of this transport for uptake and accumulation of environmental contaminants is unknown. Two case studies are presented. The first describes modeled effects of pH and biotransformation on the bioconcentration of organic acids and bases, while the second employs an updated model to investigate factors responsible for accumulation of perfluorinated alkyl acids. The perfluorinated alkyl acid case study is notable insofar as it illustrates the likely importance of membrane transporters in the kidney and highlights the potential value of read-across approaches. Recognizing the current need to perform bioaccumulation hazard assessments and ecological and exposure risk assessment for IOCs, the authors provide a tiered strategy that progresses (as needed) from conservative assumptions (models and associated data) to more sophisticated models requiring chemical-specific information.

We aim to list and discuss occurrence and treatment efficiencies, develop a new way to characterize mobile compounds by their basic properties, and provide a report of status and research needs on aquatic and multimedia models. The compound groups include selected per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and other compounds. Octanol-water distribution coefficients (D) are calculated for PFAS by an expression including octanol-water partition coefficients (P) and ionization (Ka) constants, and by using Chemicalize.com for multi-protic PPCPs and other compounds. Log D ranges between − 6 and 0 for PFAS and between − 8 and 5 for PPCPs and pesticides. This is significantly lower than the ranges of P for nonpolar compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Many pharmaceuticals and potential endocrine disruptors can be removed effectively in source, finished and distribution supply water through sorption, chemical oxidation, photolysis, and biodegradation. Sediment core profiles of polar organics may not reflect the chronology of their production and use, due to post-depositional mobility of the relatively water-soluble compounds. A novel approach for identifying mobile compounds is developed using sediment records extending downcore past authorization or initiation dates for the compounds. We find that an area limited by log water solubility µmol/L &gt; 4.2 and log D &lt; −0.8 approximately defines an area of mobile compounds here represented by perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA) and atenolol. Models in the aquatic or multimedia phases have been developed for PFAS with a hydrodynamic model; for insecticides and fungicides using geographic information system (GIS) and fugacity equations; and for atrazine and pharmaceuticals, considering mass flow. Global models were proposed and tested for PFAS and diclofenac. Automated calibration, fugacity calculations under nonequilibrium conditions, and toxicity evaluations could improve existing and future models. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Biodegradation; Geographic information systems; Information use; Pesticides; Photolysis; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Water pollution; Water supply systems; Fate and transport; Modeling; Natural waters; Organic waters; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Pharmaceutical and personal care products; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Property; Property and fate and transport; Water pollutants; Organic pollutants

Motion will be a problem with most of the current pulse sequences, but the problem appears manageable given many of the newer software options for motion suppression. Faster pulse sequences (approaching CT scan times) will serve to improve image quality and reduce the need for sedation. Identification of a reliable enteric contrast agent probably will expand the current utility of MRI beyond evaluation of solid abdominal viscera. Although preliminary results appear promising, controlled comparative studies are necessary to determine the exact role of MRI in diagnosis and staging of common pediatric abdominal malignancies. The addition of MRI intravenous contrast agents and MR spectroscopy are anticipated to add depth and specificity to the diagnostic potential of this exciting modality.","contrast medium; gadolinium pentetate; iron; iron oxide; perfluorooctyl bromide; abdominal disease; child; childhood cancer; diaphragm hernia; human; infant; intravenous drug administration; neuroblastoma; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pediatrics; priority journal; review; Abdomen; Adrenal Gland Diseases; Child; Child, Preschool; Digestive System Diseases; Human; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Kidney Diseases; Liver Diseases; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Splenic Diseases"

The aim of this review is to summarize several monitoring studies in Japan and characterize the toxicokinetics of these compounds. We found that the levels of contamination by these compounds had unique patterns in Japan. The levels of PFOA in serum from inhabitants of the Kansai region were higher than those of other regions. The PFOA levels in air and water samples from the Kansai region were also relatively high. The estimated intakes from these routes partly explain the differences in the serum levels. The toxicokinetics of these compounds have been investigated. Serum samples from male participants had significantly higher geometric means for PFOS and PFOA compared to samples from female participants. This sex-related difference was partly simulated by menstrual blood loss. There are large interspecies differences in the excretion pathways of these compounds. The serum clearances of PFOA via urine were 300-1,000-fold lower in humans than in Wistar rats and Japanese macaques. On the other hand, the biliary excretion of these compounds was comparable in rats and humans, and the long half-lives in humans may be attributable to the low levels of urinary excretion and high biliary reabsorption rates. These findings suggest that qualitative differences in the excretion routes exist between humans and other species. For risk assessment of these compounds, further information regarding sources of exposure and their toxicokinetics is needed. © 2008 The Japanese Society for Hygiene.",perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; animal experiment; biliary excretion; biological monitoring; blood level; carcinogenicity; environmental exposure; female; half life time; human; Japan; liver toxicity; Macaca; male; menstruation; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; occupational exposure; rat; reproductive toxicity; review; risk assessment; sex difference; species difference; toxicity; toxicokinetics; urinary excretion; Macaca; Rattus; Rattus norvegicus

As such, PFCs represent a distinctly different class of pharmaceutical artificial oxygen (and other gas) transporters than are hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs). These two classes of agents have contrasting mechanisms for respiratory gases transport; therefore, each has different advantages and side effects. Both PFCs and HBOCs have suffered from a misguided historical research effort to outperform human banked blood. The PFCs should be viewed as pharmaceuticals possessing unique gas solubility and diffusion characteristics such that they may relieve ischemia of tissues with low/flow-no flow states therefore they can enhance tissue salvage while other definitive treatments are being sought.

We review here the current HBM efforts for organophosphate esters, emerging flame retardants, perfluoroalkyl substances, and phthalate esters. Use of some of these chemicals has already been banned or restricted; they are regularly detected in the environment, wildlife, and human matrices. Traditionally, blood and urine collection have been widely used as sampling methods. New non-invasive approaches (e.g., saliva, hair, nails) are emerging as valid alternatives since they offer advantages with respect to sampling, handling, and ethical aspects, while ensuring similar reliability and sensitivity. Nevertheless, the identification of biomarkers of exposure is often difficult because chemicals may be metabolized in the human body. For many of the above-mentioned compounds, the mechanisms of the favorable metabolization pathways have not been unraveled, but research on important metabolites that could be used as biomarkers of exposure is growing.

This is an actin-binding molecular motor essential for development that participates in many crucial cellular processes such as adhesion, cell migration, cytokinesis and polarization, maintenance of cell shape and signal transduction. Several types of mutations in the MYH9 gene cause an array of autosomal dominant disorders, globally known as MYH9-related diseases (MYH9-RD). These include May-Hegglin anomaly (MHA), Epstein syndrome (EPS), Fechtner syndrome (FTS) and Sebastian platelet syndrome (SPS). Although caused by different MYH9 mutations, all patients present macrothrombocytopenia, but may later display other pathologies, including loss of hearing, renal failure and presenile cataracts. The correlation between the molecular and cellular effects of the different mutations and clinical presentation are beginning to be established. In this review, we correlate the defects that MYH9 mutations cause at a molecular and cellular level (for example, deficient filament formation, altered ATPase activity or actin-binding) with the clinical presentation of the syndromes in human patients. We address why these syndromes are tissue restricted, and the existence of possible compensatory mechanisms, including residual activity of mutant NMII-A and/ or the formation of heteropolymers or co-polymers with other NMII isoforms.","myosin heavy chain; myosin IIA; genetics; human; metabolism; mutation; perception deafness; phenotype; thrombocytopenia; Hearing Loss, Sensorineural; Humans; Mutation; Myosin Heavy Chains; Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIA; Phenotype; Thrombocytopenia"

This research aims to elucidate the trait-based approaches used in recent macrophyte studies to outline their applications, shortcomings, and future challenges. A systematic literature review focused on macrophytes and FTs was carried out on Scopus database (last accessed May 2020). The latest 520 papers published from 2010 to 2020, which represent 70 % of the whole literature selected since 1969, were carefully screened. Reviewed studies mainly investigated: 1) the role of FTs in shaping communities; 2) the responses of macrophytes to environmental gradients; 3) the application of FTs in monitoring anthropic pressures; and 4) the reasons for success of invasive species. Studied areas were concentrated in Europe (41 %) and Asia (32 %), overlooking other important biodiversity hotspots, and only 6.2 % of the world macrophytes species were investigated in dedicated single species studies. The FTs most commonly used include leaf economic and morphological traits, and we noticed a lack of attention on root traits and in general on spatial traits patterns, as well as a relatively poor understanding of how FTs mediate biotic interactions. High-throughput techniques, such as remote sensing, allow to map fine-scale variability of selected traits within and across systems, helping to clarify multiple links of FTs with ecological drivers and processes. We advise to promote investigations on root traits, and to push forward the integration of multiple approaches to better clarify the role of macrophytes at multiple scales. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",biodiversity; environmental gradient; future prospect; invasive species; literature review; macrophyte; morphology; taxonomy; trend analysis; Asia; Europe; Scopus

To conduct a mass balance of PFAS through these engineered systems, environmental analytical chemistry must be leveraged to quantify PFAS in the various media that cycle through these facilities. Although mass balances have been attempted across various unit treatment processes for a small selection of PFAS in WTPs and WWTPs, system-wide mass balances are a daunting challenge that have not been achieved to date. The continued existence of legacy PFAS and the constantly moving target of newly emerging commercial PFAS and transformation products (TPs), in addition to complications resulting from bias-free collection of uncontaminated samples for PFAS in the parts-per-trillion (ppt) range, complicate a mass balance. Further compounding a mass balance is the diverse universe of PFAS which consists of polar/nonpolar, nonvolatile/semi-volatile/volatile, and neutral/anionic/cationic/zwitterionic chemicals. The physicochemical properties of these chemicals, and the media in which they exist, drive the selection of appropriate analytical procedures to provide accurate and precise quantification of these compounds. The current state of analytical science for PFAS is development of methods specific for subgroups of PFAS families in limited matrices. Here, approaches to integrate analytical workflows across types of PFAS and media are proposed. In this evaluation, multi-platform targeted, suspect/non-targeted, and surrogate screening methods combining promulgated standardized methods and emerging procedures are presented. Synthesis of a comprehensive analytical workflow that aspires to achieve a mass balance of PFAS across the gaseous, solid, and aqueous matrices encountered in WTPs and WWTPs is proposed. Finally, research data gaps and future research needs are also discussed. © 2021 The Authors","Chemical analysis; Compounding (chemical); Digital storage; Physicochemical properties; Urban transportation; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Analytical methodology; Analytical procedure; Environmental analytical chemistry; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Standardized methods; Transformation products; Wastewater treatment plants; Water and wastewater treatments; Sewage treatment plants; 4,8 dioxa 3h perfluorononanoic acid; 9 chlorohexadecafluoro 3 oxanonane 1 sulfonic acid; bis(perfluorooctyl)phosphinic acid; carbon tetrafluoride; dichlorodifluoromethane; drinking water; fluorotelomer; fluorotelomer sulfonic acid; ground water; hexafluoro 2 propanol; hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid; norflurane; organic compound; per and polyfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorinated alkane; perfluorinated alkene; perfluoroalkane sulfonic acid; perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid; perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acid; perfluoroalkyl phosphonic acid; perfluorobutyl iodide; perfluorobutylphosphonic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoropolyether; polymer; polytetrafluoroethylene; polyurethan; surface water; unclassified drug; water; analytical method; hydrological cycle; mass spectrometry; organohalogen; urban area; wastewater treatment; water treatment plant; aqueous solution; chemical analysis; design; fluorination; gas; greenhouse gas; limit of detection; liquid; mass spectrometry; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; nonhuman; physical chemistry; quality control; Review; sample; solid; storage; urban area; waste water management; water cycle; water treatment; workflow"

For this very purpose are a multitude of diverse methods which are continuously being improved, which, in turn, makes it difficult to choose which techniques to use in practice. Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss both experimental and computational approaches for affinity evaluation. Basic principles, general limitations and advantages, as well as main areas of application in drug discovery, are overviewed for some of the most popular ligand binding assays. The authors further provide a guide to affinity predictions, collectively covering several techniques that are used in the first stages of rational drug design. Expert opinion: All affinity estimation methods have limitations and advantages that partially overlap and complement one another. Some of the suggested best practices include cross-verification of data using at least two different techniques and careful data interpretation. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",drug; ligand; protein; protein binding; binding affinity; cell assay; cellular thermal shift assay; computer model; differential scanning calorimetry; drug binding; drug design; drug receptor binding; drug screening; drug stability; electrophoresis; fluorescence analysis; fluorescence thermal shift assay; human; isothermal titration calorimetry; ligand binding; light scattering; medical informatics; microscale thermophoresis; mobility shift assay; nuclear magnetic resonance; optical spectroscopy; priority journal; quantitative structure activity relation; quantum mechanics; receptor binding assay; Review; single drug dose; spectroscopy; ultracentrifugation; drug development; metabolism; procedures; Drug Design; Drug Development; Drug Discovery; Humans; Ligands; Protein Binding; Proteins

Due to the increment in human consumption, the need for water resources is increasing, and it is estimated that more than 40% of the population worldwide will face water stress/scarcity within the next few decades. Water recycling and reuse may offer the opportunity to expand water resources. For that, the wastewater treatment paradigm should be changed and adequately treated wastewater should be seen as a valuable resource instead of a waste product. It is easily understandable that the exact composition and constituent concentration of wastewater vary according to its different sources (industrial, agricultural, urban usage of water). Consequently, a variety of known and emerging pollutants like heavy metals, antibiotics, pesticides, phthalates, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated compounds and endocrine disruptors have been found in natural water reservoirs, due to the limited effectiveness of conventional wastewater treatment. The conventional approach consists of a combination of physical, chemical and biological processes, aiming at the removal of large sediments such as heavier solids, scum and grease and of organic content in order to avoid the growth of microorganisms and eutrophication of the receiving water bodies. However, this approach is not sufficient to reduce the chemical pollutants and much less the emerging chemical pollutants. In this review, after some considerations concerning chemical pollutants and the problematic efficiency of their removal by conventional methods, an update is presented on the successes and challenges of novel approaches for wastewater remediation based on advanced oxidation processes.

The resulting oxygen deficit has important consequences with regard to the aggressiveness and malignancy of tumors, as well as their resistance to therapy, endowing the imaging of hypoxia with vital repercussions in tumor prognosis and therapy design. The molecular and cellular events underlying hypoxia are mediated mainly through hypoxia-inducible factor, a transcription factor with pleiotropic effects over a variety of cellular processes, including oncologic transformation, invasion and metastasis. However, few methodologies have been able to monitor noninvasively the oxygen tensions in vivo. MRI and MRS are often used for this purpose. Most MRI approaches are based on the effects of the local oxygen tension on: (i) the relaxation times of 19F or 1H indicators, such as perfluorocarbons or their 1H analogs; (ii) the hemodynamics and magnetic susceptibility effects of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin; and (iii) the effects of paramagnetic oxygen on the relaxation times of tissue water. 19F MRS approaches monitor tumor hypoxia through the selective accumulation of reduced nitroimidazole derivatives in hypoxic zones, whereas electron spin resonance methods determine the oxygen level through its influence on the linewidths of appropriate paramagnetic probes in vivo. Finally, Overhauser-enhanced MRI combines the sensitivity of EPR methodology with the resolution of MRI, providing a window into the future use of hyperpolarized oxygen probes. Tumor hypoxia has important consequences in the aggressiveness and malignancy of tumors, as well as in their resistance to therapy, endowing the imaging of pO2 levels with vital repercussions in tumor prognosis and therapy design.

This review examined studies on the environmental occurrence of PFASs in different water systems in the United States (US) along with similar studies in the other countries. The review has thus revealed a few patterns regarding the environmental occurrence of PFASs having different molecular features, the impact of possible upstream PFAS sources, and the effects of water treatment facilities. Further research is needed to analyze a wider array of PFASs, particularly those playing roles in PFAS degradation pathways.

Here, we review reported internal exposure levels of various HOPs (organochlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, short- and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) in placenta, and both maternal and umbilical cord sera. We also present analyses of the transplacental transfer and placental distribution characteristics of each class of compounds, and discuss effects of several factors on the transfer and accumulation efficiencies of HOPs, as well as the main mechanisms of HOPs’ transfer across the placental barrier. Reported compound-specific transplacental transfer efficiencies and distribution efficiencies, expressed as umbilical cord:maternal serum and placental:maternal serum concentration ratios (RCM and RPM, respectively), are summarized. Average published RCM values of the HOPs range from 0.24 to 3.08 (lipid-adjusted) and from 0.04 to 3.1 (based on wet weights), and are highest for perfluoroalkylcarboxylates (PFCAs) and tetrabromobisphenol A. Average published RPM values range from 0.14 to 1.02 (lipid-adjusted) and from 0.30 to 1.4 (based on wet weights). The broad RCM and RPM ranges may reflect effects of various factors, inter alia physicochemical properties of HOPs, metabolic capacities of mothers and fetuses, placental maturity, and differential expression of influx/efflux transporters in the placenta. Generally, HOPs’ RCM values decline linearly with molecular size, and are curvilinearly related to solubility. Plasma protein binding affinity and the difference between maternal and fetal metabolic capacities may also affect some HOPs’ transfer efficiencies. HOPs’ molecular size may be influential. Transplacental transport of HOPs likely occurs mostly through passive diffusion, although influx/efflux transporters expressed on maternal and/or fetal sides of the placenta may also facilitate or hinder their transport. Overall, the review highlights clear gaps in our understanding of mechanisms involved in HOPs’ transplacental transport. © 2020 The Author(s)",Binding energy; Biochemistry; Efficiency; Halogenation; Metabolism; Organic chemicals; Physicochemical properties; Distribution characteristics; Distribution efficiency; Medium-chain chlorinated paraffins; Organochlorinated pesticides; Plasma protein binding; Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Transfer characteristics; Transplacental transfers; Organic pollutants; organochlorine pesticide; paraffin; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkylcarboxylate; plasma protein; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; tetrabromobisphenol A; unclassified drug; diphenyl ether derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; halogen; health impact; metabolism; persistent organic pollutant; physicochemical property; plasma; pollution exposure; serum; solubility; active transport; anthropometric parameters; binding affinity; bioaccumulation; halogenated organic pollutant; human; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; isomer; maternal blood; metabolic capacity; molecular size; passive transport; persistent organic pollutant; physical chemistry; placenta; placental transfer; pollution transport; prenatal exposure; priority journal; protein expression; Review; risk factor; solubility; systematic review; transport kinetics; umbilical cord blood; chemistry; female; fetomaternal transfusion; pollutant; pregnancy; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Persistent Organic Pollutants; Placenta; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Pregnancy

The existing modifications to improve CWs performance from the direct optimization of internal components to the indirect adjunction of external resources promoted the wastewater treatment efficiency to a certain degree, but the sustainability and sufficiency of pollutants removal remains a challenge.

Studies demonstrating the activity of the various thymic factors in increasing the immunocompetence potential in both in vitro and in vivo conditions are discussed. The immunostimulatory potential of thymic factors was also investigated in experimental models where beneficial therapeutic effects were sought in a situation of immunological malfunction. The last part of the review is dedicated to clinical trials with thymic factors that revealed improvement in the immunocompetence potential in cases of immunodeficiencies, viral infections, and cancer and its correlation with therapeutic effectiveness. It seems that more research is required in order to better define conditions for the use of thymic factors in immunotherapy.",alpha interferon; beta interferon; cyclophosphamide; fluorouracil; humoral thymus factor; interleukin 2; melphalan; prothymosin alpha; thymopoietin; thymosin; thymostimulin; thymulin; thymus hormone; autoimmune disease; cancer chemotherapy; cancer immunotherapy; clinical trial; cytomegalovirus; human; immune deficiency; immunocompetence; immunopotentiation; Lewis carcinoma; melanoma; metastasis; nonhuman; plasmacytoma; priority journal; review; sendai virus; thymus; virus infection; Animals; Clinical Trials; Humans; Immunotherapy; Oligopeptides; Thymus Hormones

These compounds can trigger biological activity by activating the alpha isotype of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate gene expression; however, some biological effects may occur independently of the receptor. Activation of the peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor alpha (PPARα) modulates lipid and glucose homeostasis, cell proliferation and differentiation, and inflammation. Reported immunomodulation in experimental animals exposed to PFOA and PFOS has included altered inflammatory responses, production of cytokines and other proteins, reduced lymphoid organ weights, and altered antibody synthesis. Mounting experimental animal evidence suggests PPARα independence of some immune effects. This evidence originates primarily from studies with PPARα knockout models exposed to PFOA that demonstrate hepatic peroxisome proliferation, reduced lymphoid organ weights, and altered antibody synthesis. As human PPARα expression is significantly less than that of rodents, potential PPARα independence indicates that future research must explore mechanisms of action of these compounds, including PPARα -dependent and -independent pathways. This multiauthored review contains brief descriptions of current and recently published work exploring immunomodulation by PFOA and PFOS, as well as a short overview of other PPARα ligands of therapeutic and environmental interest.

Hydrocarbon separations have traditionally relied predominantly on costly and energy-intensive heat-driven procedures such as low-temperature distillations. Adsorptive separation based on porous solids represents an alternative technology that is potentially more energy efficient for the separation of some hydrocarbons. Great efforts have been made recently not only in the development of adsorbents with optimal separation performance but also toward the subsequent implementation of adsorption-based separation technology. Emerging as a relatively new class of multifunctional porous materials, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) hold substantial promise as adsorbents for highly efficient separation of hydrocarbons. This is because of their exceptional and intrinsic porosity tunability, which enables size-exclusion-based separations that render the highest possible separation selectivity. In this review, recent advances in the development of MOFs for separation of selected groups of hydrocarbons are reviewed, including methane/C2 hydrocarbons, normal alkanes, alkane isomers, and alkane/alkene/alkyne and C8 alkylaromatics, with a particular focus on separations based on the size-exclusion mechanism. Insights into tailor-made structures, material design strategies, and structure–property relationships will be elucidated.

However, with only six years follow-up on average, little is known about the long-term durability of transcatheter implanted biological tissue. Moreover, the high cost of biological tissue harvesting and chemical treatment procedures favor the development of alternative synthetic valve leaflet materials. In that context, thin, flexible and porous textile constructions could be considered as interesting candidates. However, these constructions must be strong enough to withstand the load applied on the leaflet especially in aortic position. Moreover, the interaction of textile material with living tissue should be comparable to biological valve tissue, and the foreign body reaction (FBR) as well as the calcification mechanisms should be controlled. In the frame of heart valve tissue engineering strategies, the use of bioresorbable polymer scaffolds is expected to limit that FBR. However, to precisely control the degradation of the polymer is not trivial. Conversely, when permanent textile polymers are considered, the porosity of the fibrous scaffold tends to induce exaggerated tissue ingrowth which may prevent the implants from remaining flexible. In that context, the ideal synthetic fibrous valve leaflet remains to be found. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible strategies which have been adopted over the last 50 years regarding the use of textile as heart valve leaflet material. Results showed that textile presented potential, despite remaining strong challenges. It came out that hybrid textiles combining bioresorbable and permanent polymer fibers arranged in both non-woven and woven or knitted way could probably help providing strength and generating appropriate tissue ingrowth. © 2020 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA",collagen; macrogol; polyethylene terephthalate; polymer; polypropylene; scaffold protein; polymer; biocompatibility; blood vessel wall; calcification; cancer research; cell proliferation; encapsulation; follow up; foreign body reaction; heart valve; hemodynamics; histology; human; Leydig cell; pulmonary valve replacement; Review; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue regeneration; transcatheter aortic valve implantation; adverse event; animal; aortic valve; biodegradable implant; chemistry; convalescence; devices; foreign body reaction; heart valve prosthesis; heart valve replacement; pathophysiology; prosthesis complication; prosthesis design; risk factor; time factor; tissue engineering; treatment outcome; valvular heart disease; Absorbable Implants; Animals; Aortic Valve; Foreign-Body Reaction; Heart Valve Diseases; Heart Valve Prosthesis; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Humans; Polymers; Prosthesis Design; Prosthesis Failure; Recovery of Function; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Tissue Engineering; Treatment Outcome

The TxSnFELS is very common and not diagnostic for any chemical or class of chemicals. This sublethal toxicity syndrome is mostly observed at high exposure concentrations and appears to be a baseline, non-specific toxicity response; however, it can also occur at low doses by specific action. Toxicity metrics for this syndrome generally occur at concentrations just below those causing mortality and have been reported for a large number of diverse chemicals. Predictions based on tissue concentrations or quantitative-structure activity relationship (QSAR) models support the designation of baseline toxicity for many of the tested chemicals, which is confirmed by observed values. Given the sheer number of disparate chemicals causing the TxSnFELS and correlation with QSAR derived partitioning; the only logical conclusion for these high-dose responses is baseline toxicity by nonspecific action and not a lock and key type receptor response. It is important to recognize that many chemicals can act both as baseline toxicants and specific acting toxicants likely via receptor interaction and it is not possible to predict those threshold doses from baseline toxicity. We should search out these specific low-dose responses for ecological risk assessment and not rely on high-concentration toxicity responses to guide environmental protection. The goal for toxicity assessment should not be to characterize toxic responses at baseline toxicity concentrations, but to evaluate chemicals for their most toxic potential. Additional aspects of this review evaluated the fish ELS teratogenic responses in relation to mammalian oral LD50s and explored potential key events responsible for baseline toxicity. © 2021","Computational chemistry; Fish; Indicators (chemical); Mammals; Molecular graphics; Risk assessment; Baseline toxicity; Earliest life; Fish early-life stage; High dose; Life stages; Low dose; Mechanism of action; Sublethal toxicity; Sublethal toxicity syndrome; Teratogen; Toxicity; 3,4 dichloroaniline; 4 nonylphenol; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; acetochlor; acrylamide; alcohol; atrazine; bisphenol F; bisphenol S; caffeine; carbamazepine; cetirizine; chlorpyrifos; cyanide; diclofenac; dimethyl sulfoxide; dimetindene; doxylamine; ethinylestradiol; ethosuximide; fenitrothion; genistein; isoniazid; ketotifen; parathion; pentachlorophenol; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; phenanthrene; phenol derivative; propranolol; pyriproxyfen; retinoic acid; tebuconazole; triadimefon; unclassified drug; valproic acid; concentration (composition); environmental protection; sublethal effect; toxicity; concentration (parameter); ecology; ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; environmental protection; fish; human; LD50; life cycle stage; mammal; mortality rate; nonhuman; prediction; Review; risk assessment; structure activity relation; animal; dangerous goods; quantitative structure activity relation; toxicity; water pollutant; Mammalia; Animals; Fishes; Hazardous Substances; Lethal Dose 50; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

In these cells, a hydrated polymer membrane acts as an electrolyte layer through which protons travel. Due to the complex nature of the membranes used, the optimization of fuel cell performance is a difficult task, and relies on a number of factors, such as hydration level, polymer side chain length and composition, equivalent weight, morphology, and chemical and mechanical stabilities. Molecular dynamics is a particularly powerful tool for studying PEMs, as it provides the computational efficiency to study length and time scales relevant to these systems. In this review, we present results from several computational papers that use reactive molecular dynamics, which explicitly describe bond breaking and formation, to study proton transport in several polymers commonly used in PEMs. The results presented demonstrate the importance of the interaction between hydronium and the charged side chains and the morphology on the performance of PEM fuel cells.

Various extraction methods have been used for their separation from various matrices, ranging from classical liquid-liquid extractions to various microextraction techniques, but the most frequently applied extraction technique remains the solid-phase extraction (SPE), which is the focus of this review. We present an overview of the methods, developed in the last decade, applied for the determination of benzotriazoles in aqueous and solid environmental samples. Several other matrices, such as human urine and plant material, are also considered in the text. The methods are reviewed according to the determined compounds, sample matrices, cartridges and eluents used, extraction recoveries and the achieved limits of quantification.

Toxoplasmosis is a major cause of mortality and contributor to the slow rate of population recovery for southern sea otters in California. An updated seroprevalence analysis showed that 52% of 305 freshly dead, beachcast sea otters and 38% of 257 live sea otters sampled along the California coast from 1998 to 2004 were infected with T. gondii. Areas with high T. gondii exposure were predominantly sandy bays near urban centres with freshwater runoff. Genotypic characterisation of 15 new T. gondii isolates obtained from otters in 2004 identified only X alleles at B1 and SAG1. A total of 38/50 or 72% of all otter isolates so far examined have been infected with a Type X strain. Type X isolates were also obtained from a Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and California sea lion (Zalophus californianus). Molecular analysis using the C8 RAPD marker showed that the X isolates were more genetically heterogeneous than archetypal Type I, II and III genotypes of T. gondii. The origin and transmission of the Type X T. gondii genotype are not yet clear. Sea otters do not prey on known intermediate hosts for T. gondii and vertical transmission appears to play a minor role in maintaining infection in the populations. Therefore, the most likely source of infection is by infectious, environmentally resistant oocysts that are shed in the feces of felids and transported via freshwater runoff into the marine ecosystem. As nearshore predators, otters serve as sentinels of protozoal pathogen flow into the marine environment since they share the same environment and consume some of the same foods as humans. Investigation into the processes promoting T. gondii infections in sea otters will provide a better understanding of terrestrial parasite flow and the emergence of disease at the interface between wildlife, domestic animals and humans. © 2005 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

C1 to C4 PAE are used in non-vinyl commercial products and pharmaceuticals. C8 to C10 PAE are additives imparting flexibility to vinyl resins. The purpose of the present study is to assess chronic effects of PAE on aquatic organisms. Studies show that populations of fish and invertebrates may be adversely affected by exposure to C1 to C4 PAE, but are not adversely affected by exposure to C8 or higher PAE. Secondary endpoints, including molecular, biochemical, and/or histological responses to chemical exposure, do not appear to predict effects related to primary endpoints of survival, growth and development, or reproductive fitness. A previously published risk assessment for C1 to C4 PAE demonstrated low risks in North American and Western European surface waters. Risk assessments conducted by authorities in Europe with di-2-ethylhexyl-, di-isononyl-, and di-isodecyl phthalates have concluded no risks to aquatic organisms due to aqueous solubility constraints, low expected surface water concentrations, and metabolic biotransformation capabilities of aquatic organisms. The present review of chronic aquatic toxicity data, which includes data from studies performed subsequent to the risk assessments, confirms these earlier conclusions. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Invertebrata

It is a complex multifaceted injury affecting initially the airway; however, in short time, it can become a complex life-threatening systemic disease affecting every organ in the body. In this review, we provide a summary of the underlying pathophysiology of organ dysfunction and provide an up-to-date survey of the various critical care modalities that have been found beneficial in caring for these patients. Major pathophysiological change is development of edema in the respiratory tract. The tracheobronchial tree is injured by steam and toxic chemicals, leading to bronchoconstriction. Lung parenchyma is damaged by the release of proteolytic elastases, leading to release of inflammatory mediators, increase in transvascular flux of fluids, and development of pulmonary edema and atelectasis. Decreased levels of surfactant and immunomodulators such as interleukins and tumor-necrosis-factor-α accentuate the injury. A primary survey is conducted at the site of fire, to ensure adequate airway, breathing, and circulation. A good intravenous access is obtained for the administration of resuscitation fluids. Early intubation, preferably with fiberoptic bronchoscope, is prudent before development of airway edema. Bronchial hygiene is maintained, which involves therapeutic coughing, chest physiotherapy, deep breathing exercises, and early ambulation. Pharmacological agents such as beta-2 agonists, racemic epinephrine, N-acetyl cysteine, and aerosolized heparin are used for improving oxygenation of lungs.

There has been tremendous progress in the technologies needed to address the concerns that conventional and novel water contaminants pose. Yet, to date, only a few relatively small DPR operations have been installed. As we get closer to the point where regulations are finalized and serious investments are planned, there is a need to ask: Are we ready? In this Review, we explore the technological, economic, and environmental considerations associated with DPR. In particular, we focus on the status of technologies for addressing the most challenging water pollutants, the cost estimates for DPR, and the energy demand and associated implications of DPR. We find that, although the technologies are nearly ready for DPR, the most critical issue will be real-time monitoring of a number of molecules that pose distinct challenges to advanced treatment trains. In addition, there is a need to consider emergency planning, both in terms of emergency buffer reservoir(s) and planning for situations in which the treated water does not meet specifications. Since any advanced treatment train will result in a significant increase in embedded energy, it will be particularly important to plan for renewable energy to minimize environmental impacts. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",NA

Studies that report on this association are difficult to summarize due to weak associations and wide confidence intervals. One way to advance this field is to sharpen the biologic theory on a causal pathway behind this association, and to measure it directly by way of molecular biomarkers. The aim of this review is to summarize the literature that supports a novel pathway between PFAS exposure and GDM development. Epidemiological studies demonstrate a clear association of biomarkers of thyroid hormones and glucose metabolism with GDM development. We report biologic plausibility and epidemiologic evidence that PFAS dysregulation of maternal thyroid hormones and thyrotropin (TSH) may disrupt glucose homeostasis, increasing the risk of GDM. Overall, epidemiological studies demonstrate that PFAS were positively associated with TSH and negatively with triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). PFAS were generally positively associated with glucose and insulin levels in pregnancy. We propose dysregulation of thyroid function and glucose metabolism may be a critical and missing component in the accurate estimation of PFAS on the risk of GDM. © 2021, The Author(s).","biological marker; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liothyronine; organic compound; per and polyfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; thyroid hormone; thyrotropin; thyroxine; unclassified drug; biological marker; fluorocarbon; glucose; thyroid hormone; biomarker; diabetes; epidemiology; glucose; health risk; homeostasis; hormone; metabolism; pregnancy; risk factor; ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; glucose homeostasis; glucose metabolism; glucose tolerance; human; insulin release; maternal welfare; nonhuman; pathogenesis; placenta; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnant woman; Review; thyroid function; adverse event; environmental exposure; female; metabolism; pollutant; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; risk; Biomarkers; Diabetes, Gestational; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Glucose; Humans; Pregnancy; Risk; Thyroid Hormones"

Cigarette smoke produces cancer, emphysema, and other diseases after a delay of years. Acute exposure to smoke in a fire can produce a loss of lung function and death after a delay of days or weeks. Tobacco smoke and the smoke inhaled in a burning building have some similarities from a chemical viewpoint. For example, both contain high concentrations of CO and other combustion products. In addition, both contain high concentrations of free radicals, and our laboratory has studied these free radicals, largely by electron spin resonance (ESR) methods, for about 15 years. This article reviews what is known about the radicals present in these different types of smokes and soots and tars and summarizes the evidence that suggests these radicals could be involved in cigarette-induced pathology and smoke-inhalation deaths. The combustion of all organic materials produces radicals, but (with the exception of the smoke from perfluoropolymers) the radicals that are detected by ESR methods (and thus the radicals that would reach the lungs) are not those that arise in the combustion process. Rather they arise from chemical reactions that occur in the smoke itself. Thus, a knowledge of the chemistry of the smoke is necessary to understand the nature of the radicals formed. Even materials as similar as cigarettes and wood (cellulose) produce smoke that contains radicals with very different lifetimes and chemical characteristics, and mechanistic rationales for this are discussed. Cigarette tar contains a semiquinone radical that is infinitely stable and can be directly observed by ESR. Aqueous extracts of cigarette tar, which contain this radical, reduce oxygen to superoxide and thus produce both hydrogen peroxide and the hydroxyl radical. These solutions both oxidize alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor (a1PI) and nick DNA. Because of the potential role of radicals in smoke-inhalation injury, we suggest that antioxidant therapy (such as use of an inhaler for persons brought out of a burning building) might prove efficacious. © 1992.","cigarette smoke; free radical; lung injury; priority journal; review; Comparative Study; DNA Damage; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Fires; Free Radicals; Human; Plants, Toxic; Plastics; Smoke; Smoke Inhalation Injury; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Tobacco; Wood; Nicotiana tabacum"

Due to the rate of toxicant accumulation, unmanaged disposal, and unknown adverse effects to the environment and the human population, there is a crucial need to screen for environmental toxicants. Animal models and in vitro models are ineffective models in predicting in vivo responses due to inter-species difference and/or lack of physiologically-relevant 3D tissue environment. Such conventional screening assays possess limitations that prevent dynamic understanding of toxicants and their metabolites produced in the human body. Organ-on-a-chip systems can recapitulate in vivo like environment and subsequently in vivo like responses generating a realistic mock-up of human organs of interest, which can potentially provide human physiology-relevant models for studying environmental toxicology. Feasibility, tunability, and low-maintenance features of organ-on-chips can also make possible to construct an interconnected network of multiple-organs-on-chip toward a realistic human-on-a-chip system. Such interconnected organ-on-a-chip network can be efficiently utilized for toxicological studies by enabling the study of metabolism, collective response, and fate of toxicants through its journey in the human body.

The main objective of this review is to discuss the influence of the human population on the concentration, distribution and biological effects of PPCPs across the Antarctic coastal marine ecosystem. We carried out a review of the scientific articles published for PPCPs in Antarctic, supported by the information of the Antarctic stations reported by Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (CONMAP), Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty (ATS). In addition, spatial data regarding the Antarctic continent was obtained from Quantarctica. Antarctic concentrations of PPCPs were more reflective of the treatment system used by research stations as opposed to the infrastructure built or the annual occupancy by station. The main problem is that most of the research stations lack tertiary treatment, resulting in elevated concentrations of PPCPs in effluents. Furthermore, the geographic distribution of Antarctic field stations in coastal areas allows for the release of PPCPs, directly into the sea, a practice that remains in compliance with the current Protocol. After their release, PPCPs can become incorporated into sea ice, which can then act as a chemical reservoir. In addition, there is no clarity on the effects on the local biota. Finally, we recommend regulating the entry and use of PPCPs in Antarctica given the difficulties of operating, and in some cases the complete absence of appropriate treatment systems. Further studies are needed on the fate, transport and biological effects of PPCPs on the Antarctic biota. It is recommended that research efforts be carried out in areas inhabited by humans to generate mitigation measures relative to potential adverse impacts. Tourism should be also considered in further studies due the temporal release of PPCPs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystems; Effluents; Geographical distribution; Reservoirs (water); Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Antarctica; Biological effects; Coastal seawater; Coastal waters; Pharmaceutical and personal care product; Pharmaceutical and personal care products; Research stations; Treatment systems; Waste water treatment plants; Wastewater treatment plant; Sea ice; chemical agent; pharmaceutical and personal care product; unclassified drug; cosmetic; drug; bioaccumulation; coastal water; marine ecosystem; pollution effect; PPCP; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; water pollution; Antarctica; coastal waters; concentration (parameter); geographic distribution; pollutant; Review; sea ice; seashore; wastewater; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; human; pollutant; procedures; wastewater; water pollutant; Antarctica; Antarctic Regions; Cosmetics; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

However, scientific and technical improvements are still needed to accommodate the increasing demands of fuel cell systems for specific applications. Higher performance, low cost, greater durability, better water management, and the ability to function at higher temperatures are some of the challenges that must be overcome before widespread commercial adoption of fuel cell technology occurs. Approaches and recent progress toward the development of polymer electrolyte membranes for fuel cells are reviewed. The newly developed/developing polymer membranes can be classified into four groups: modified PFSA membranes, alternative sulfonated polymers and their inorganic composite membranes, acid-base complex membranes, and ionic liquid-based gel-type proton conducting membranes. These polymer materials have a great variety of chemical structure and may be able to meet the targets for use in advanced fuel cell systems.",NA

Besides nutritional and genetic factors, different xenobiotics such as pharmaceuticals and environmental toxicants are suspected to aggravate MAFLD in obese individuals. More specifically, pre-existing fatty liver or steatohepatitis may worsen, or fatty liver may progress faster to steatohepatitis in treated patients, or exposed individuals. The mechanisms whereby xenobiotics can aggravate MAFLD are still poorly understood and are currently under deep investigations. Nevertheless, previous studies pointed to the role of different metabolic pathways and cellular events such as activation of de novo lipogenesis and mitochondrial dysfunction, mostly associated with reactive oxygen species overproduction. This review presents the available data gathered with some prototypic compounds with a focus on corticosteroids and rosiglitazone for pharmaceuticals as well as bisphenol A and perfluorooctanoic acid for endocrine disruptors.

PVA’s popularity has made wastewater treatment technologies for PVA degradation a popular research topic in industrial wastewater treatment. Although many PVA degradation technologies are studied in bench‐scale processes, recent advancements in process optimization and control of wastewater treatment technologies such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) show the feasibility of these processes by monitoring and controlling processes to meet desired regulatory standards. These wastewater treatment technologies exhibit complex reaction mechanisms leading to nonlinear and nonstationary behavior related to variability in operational conditions. Thus, black‐box dynamic modeling is a promising tool for designing control schemes since dynamic modeling is more complicated in terms of first principles and reaction mechanisms. This study seeks to provide a survey of process control methods via a comprehensive review focusing on PVA degradation methods, including biological and advanced oxidation processes, along with their reaction mechanisms, control‐oriented dynamic modeling (i.e., state‐space, transfer function, and artificial neural network modeling), and control strategies (i.e., proportional‐integral‐derivative control and predictive control) associated with wastewater treatment technologies utilized for PVA degradation. © 2021 by the authors.

For this, it was assessed 23 drinking water treatment plants and 30 municipal wastewater treatment plants around the world of different capacities. Due to the high stability, intrinsic characteristics and low concentration, adsorption to the sludge and biodegradation are the most used path to remove of these compounds in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). In water treatment plants (WTP), chlorination and application of activated granular carbon are the processes associated with the highest removal of pharmaceutical compounds, but, in general, conventional WTPs are able to reduce but not completely remove PhACs in potable water.

These equations require the potential energy and its gradient for the chemical system under study, and they may be obtained directly from an electronic structure theory. This article reviews such direct dynamics simulations. The accuracy of classical chemical dynamics is considered, with simulations highlighted for the F- + CH3OOH reaction and of energy transfer in collisions of CO2 with a perfluorinated self-assembled monolayer (F-SAM) surface. Procedures for interfacing chemical dynamics and electronic structure theory computer codes are discussed. A Hessian-based predictor-corrector algorithm and high-accuracy Hessian updating algorithm, for enhancing the efficiency of direct dynamics simulations, are described. In these simulations, an ensemble of trajectories is calculated which represents the experimental and chemical system under study. Algorithms are described for selecting the appropriate initial conditions for bimolecular and unimolecular reactions, gas-surface collisions, and initializing trajectories at transition states and conical intersections.

This concept is a novel approach to chemicals management that determines whether using substances of concern, such as PFAS, is truly essential for a given functionality. To assess the essentiality of a particular use case, three considerations need to be addressed: (1) the function (chemical, end use and service) that the chemical provides in the use case, (2) whether the function is necessary for health and safety and critical for the functioning of society and (3) if the function is necessary, whether there are viable alternatives for the chemical for this particular use. A few illustrative examples of the three-step process are provided for use cases of PFAS. The essential-use concept takes chemicals management away from a substance-by-substance approach to a group approach. For PFAS and other substances of concern, it offers a more rapid pathway toward effective management or phase-out. Parts of the concept of essential use have already been widely applied in global treaties and international regulations and it has also been recently used by product manufacturers and retailers to phase out substances of concern from supply chains.

In this comprehensive worldwide review, we collected ecotoxicology and concentration data observed in surface water for 53 high-potency EDs and performed a risk assessment. The compounds were selected from the EU watchlist of priority substances, expanded with new compounds of emerging concern (total 41), where quantifiable data were available for the past three years (2018–2020). The risk quotients ranged from <0.01 for 22 substances to 1974 for tamoxifen. The frequency of samples in which the predicted no-effect concentrations were exceeded also varied, from 1.8% to 92.7%. By using the comprehensive multi-parameter risk assessment in our study, the most current to date, we determined that tamoxifen, imidacloprid, clothianidin, four bisphenols (BPA, BPF, BPS, and BPAF), PFOA, amoxicillin, and three steroid hormones (estriol, estrone, and cyproterone) pose significant risks in the environment. Comparing two structurally very similar bisphenols, BPA and BPB, suggested that the risk from BPB is currently underestimated by at least four orders of magnitude due to the lack of ecotoxicological data availability. The methodological limitations encountered suggest that a standardized methodology for data selection and assessment is necessary, highlighting the fact that some substances are currently under-represented in the field of ecotoxicological research.

Many efforts have been geared toward their removal to guarantee safer freshwater. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline hybrid materials with high surface area and flexible rational design, which allows the incorporation of different active sites into a particular framework, thereby emerging as a potentially excellent candidate for water and wastewater treatment. Benefiting from the unique redox-active properties of MOFs, this review surveys literature update on their application for the removal of CECs. The underlaying electron transfer mechanism and strategies for incorporating redox-active sites into MOFs are comprehensively discussed. Different components of MOFs that are redox-active are further highlighted. This study elaborates the application of MOFs for Fenton-type and other advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for removing emerging contaminants.

This review summarizes and discusses the patterns and trends of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and mercury in ringed seals (Pusa hispida) and polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in the Eastern Canadian Arctic relative to the rest of the Canadian Arctic. The review provides explanations for these trends and looks at the implications of climate-related changes on contaminants in these marine mammals in a region that has been reviewed little. Presently, the highest levels of total mercury (THg) and the legacy pesticide HCH in ringed seals and polar bears are found in the Western Canadian Arctic relative to other locations. Whereas, highest levels of some legacy contaminants, including ∑ PCBs, PCB 153, ∑ DDTs, p,p′-DDE, ∑ CHLs, ClBz are found in the east (i.e., Ungava Bay and Labrador) and in the Beaufort Sea relative to other locations. The highest levels of recent contaminants, including PBDEs and PFOS are found at lower latitudes. Feeding ecology (e.g., feeding at a higher trophic position) is shaping the elevated levels of THg and some legacy contaminants in the west compared to the east. Spatial and temporal trends for POPs and THg are underpinned by historical loadings of surface ocean reservoirs including the Western Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean. Trends set up by the distribution of water masses across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago are then acted upon locally by on-going atmospheric deposition, which is the dominant contributor for more recent contaminants. Warming and continued decline in sea ice are likely to result in further shifts in food web structure, which are likely to increase contaminant burdens in marine mammals. Monitoring of seawater and a range of trophic levels would provide a better basis to inform communities about contaminants in traditionally harvested foods, allow us to understand the causes of contaminant trends in marine ecosystems, and to track environmental response to source controls instituted under international conventions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Chlorine compounds; Contamination; Ecosystems; Impurities; Mammals; Marine pollution; Mercury (metal); Mercury compounds; Meteorological problems; Oceanography; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Reservoirs (water); Sea ice; Canadian Arctic; Canadian Arctic Archipelago; International conventions; Marine environment; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Persistent organic pollutants; Spatial and temporal trends; Spatial trends; Organic pollutants; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 2,2',4,4',5,5' hexachlorobiphenyl; campheclor; chlordane; chlorphenotane; dieldrin; hexachlorobenzene; lindane; mercury; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; chlorphenotane; diphenyl ether derivative; mercury; pentabromodiphenyl ether; pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl; bear; bioaccumulation; ecosystem response; food web; marine pollution; mercury (element); organohalogen; persistent organic pollutant; pinniped; sea ice; trend analysis; warming; Arctic; atmospheric deposition; Canada; climate; feeding ecology; fish; food web; invertebrate; latitude; nonhuman; persistent organic pollutant; Pinnipedia; polar bear; priority journal; Review; ringed seal; sea ice; trend study; trophic level; warming; analysis; animal; aquatic species; Atlantic Ocean; bear; environmental monitoring; food chain; Newfoundland and Labrador; Phocidae; pollutant; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Canada; Canadian Arctic; Mammalia; Phoca hispida; Ursus maritimus; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Arctic Regions; Atlantic Ocean; DDT; Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Food Chain; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Mercury; Newfoundland and Labrador; Pesticides; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Seals, Earless; Ursidae"

NA,Environmental pollutants and child health-A review of recent concerns,2016,NA,NA,"In recent years, many new studies have evaluated associations between environmental pollutants and child health. This review aims to provide a broad summary of this literature, comparing the state of epidemiological evidence for the effects of a wide range of environmental contaminants (air pollutants, heavy metals, organochlorine compounds, perfluoroalkyl substances, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, pesticides, phthalates and bisphenol A) on child health outcomes. The review addresses effects on foetal growth and prematurity, neurodevelopment, respiratory and immune health, and childhood growth and obesity. Findings of recent prospective studies and meta-analyses have corroborated previous good evidence, often at lower exposure levels, for effects on foetal growth of air pollution and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), for neurotoxic effects of lead, methylmercury, PCBs and organophosphate pesticides, and for respiratory health effects of air pollution. Moderate evidence has emerged for a potential role of environmental pollutants in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism (lead, PCBs, air pollution), respiratory and immune health (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene - DDE - and PCBs), and obesity (DDE). In addition, there is now moderate evidence that certain chemicals of relatively recent concern may be associated with adverse child health outcomes, specifically perfluorooctanoate and foetal growth, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers and neurodevelopment. For other chemicals of recent concern, such as phthalates and bisphenol A, the literature is characterised by large inconsistencies preventing strong conclusions. In conclusion, since most of the recent literature evaluates common exposures in the general population, and not particularly high exposure situations, this accumulating body of evidence suggests that the unborn and young child require more protection than is currently provided. Large, coordinated research efforts are needed to improve understanding of long-term effects of complex chemical mixtures. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.",NA

But, over the past three decades, various research articles reported the presence of new compounds in aquatic environment as well as in wastewater effluents, called ‘Emerging Pollutants’. Although such materials are widespread in water effluents, their toxicity and impacts on both human health and the ecosystems are poorly understood since there are no regulatory data for those contaminants. However, ever increasing of the socio-economic awareness and scientific information, scientists have become more concern for the Emerging Pollutants (EPs), widespread and their distribution in the environment. Their successful control represents the primary challenge to the industrial sector and academia. Therefore, developing technological advancement in eco-friendly environmental wastewater treatment strategies is a must. This drive the multi-disciplinary blend of chemical science, environmental engineering and industry to realise this concern from both an operational and public health standpoint. The boom of Fenton or Fenton-type modified reactions offers potential opportunities for innovative remediation techniques. The aim of this review is to update and contribute the recent developments to overcome the Fenton reaction obstacles such as acidic environment, ferric sludge production and reagent’s cost that limits its application for better frameworks. In particular, recent Fenton’s reaction approaches on the EPs removals deserve further research to adopt the system and could give rise to real applications. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Blending; Digital storage; Effluents; Remediation; Solar energy; Wastewater treatment; Acidic environment; Aquatic environments; Bibliometric analysis; Emerging pollutants; Scientific information; Sustainable environment; Technological advancement; Wastewater effluents; Oxidation
NA,Environmental chemicals and thyroid function: An update,2009,NA,NA,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To overview the effects of endocrine disrupters on thyroid function. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies in recent years have revealed thyroid-disrupting properties of many environmentally abundant chemicals. Of special concern is the exposure of pregnant women and infants, as thyroid disruption of the developing fetus may have deleterious effects on neurological outcome. Evidence is reviewed for the following groups of chemicals: polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, flame retardants, pesticides, perfluorinated chemicals, phthalates, bisphenol A and ultraviolet filters. Chemicals may exert thyroid effects through a variety of mechanisms of action, and some publications have focused on elucidating the mechanisms of specific (groups of) chemicals. SUMMARY: A large variety of ubiquitous chemicals have been shown to have thyroid-disrupting properties, and the combination of mechanistic, epidemiological and exposure studies indicates that the ubiquitous human and environmental exposure to industrial chemicals may impose a serious threat to human and wildlife thyroid homeostasis. Currently, available evidence suggests that authorities need to regulate exposure to thyroid-disrupting chemicals of pregnant women, neonates and small children in order to avoid potential impairment of brain development. Future studies will indicate whether adults also are at risk of thyroid damage due to these chemicals. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",NA

These pollutants are usually found in the real environment as mixtures alone or with metal ions. Thus, the migration risk increases, which complicates the removal of pharmaceuticals because of the combined and synergistic effects. The focus of treatment of pharmaceutical mixtures and their coexistence with metals is of considerable importance. For this purpose, adsorption has been efficiently applied to several studies for the treatment of such complex systems. In this article, the coadsorption behavior of pharmaceuticals in the absence and existence of metals on several adsorbents has been reviewed. The adsorption isotherms and kinetics of these two systems have been analyzed using different models and discussed. Important challenges and promising routes are suggested for the future development of the coadsorption of the studied systems.

In this review, we summarize the results of investigations of environmental exposures evaluated in 360 free-ranging dolphins between 2003 and 2015. Bottlenose dolphins inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon, Florida (IRL, n = 246), and coastal waters of Charleston, South Carolina (CHS, n = 114), were captured, given comprehensive health examinations, and released as part of a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional study of individual and population health. High concentrations of persistent organic pollutants including legacy contaminants (DDT and other pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl compounds) as well as 'emerging' contaminants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluorinated compounds) were detected in dolphins from CHS, with lower concentrations in the IRL. Conversely, the concentrations of mercury in the blood and skin of IRL dolphins were among the highest reported worldwide and approximately 5 times as high as those found in CHS dolphins. A high prevalence of resistance to antibiotics commonly used in humans and animals was detected in bacteria isolated from fecal, blowhole, and/or gastric samples at both sites, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at CHS. Collectively, these studies illustrate the importance of long-term surveillance of estuarine populations of bottlenose dolphins and reaffirm their important role as sentinels for marine ecosystems and public health. © 2017 Inter-Research.",biochemical composition; blood; cetacean; chemical pollutant; coastal water; dolphin; drug resistance; environmental risk; fecal coliform; mercury (element); PCB; persistent organic pollutant; pollution exposure; risk assessment; skin; Charleston; Florida [United States]; Indian River [Florida]; South Carolina; United States; Animalia; Cetacea; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Tursiops; Tursiops truncatus; animal; bottlenose dolphin; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; risk assessment; United States; Animals; Bottle-Nosed Dolphin; Environmental Monitoring; Risk Assessment; Southeastern United States

In the present study, PPs have been considered one of the emerging pollutants (EPs) and a cause of concern in river health assessment. Beyond the reported increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ABRB), PPs have been found adversely affecting the biotic diversity in such water environments. Considering Algae, Macroinvertebrates, and Fishes as three distinct trophic level indicators, the present study puts forward a framework for showing River Health Condition (RHC) based on the calculation of a River Health Index (RHI). The RHI is calculated using six Indicator Group Scores (IGS) which individually reflect river health in a defined category of water quality characteristics. While Dissolved Oxygen Related Parameters (DORP), Nutrients (NT), and PPs are taken as causative agents affecting RHCs, scores of Algal-Bacterial (AB) symbiosis, Macroinvertebrates (MI), and Fishes (F) are considered as an effect of such environmental conditions. Current wastewater treatment technologies are also not very effective in the removal of PPs. The objective of the present study is to review the harmful effects of PPs on the aquatic environment, particularly on the chemical and biotic indicators of river health. Based on predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) for algae, macroinvertebrates, and fishes in the aquatic environment and measured environmental concentration (MEC) in the river, the estimated risk quotient (RQ) for norfloxacin in the Isakavagu-Nakkavagu stream of river Godavari, Hyderabad is found 293 for algae, 39 for MI, and 335 for fish. Among PPs, in Indian rivers, the presence of caffeine is the most frequent, with algae at the highest level of risk (RQmax= 24.5). Broadly six PPs, including azithromycin, caffeine, diclofenac, naproxen, norfloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole are found above PNEC values in Indian rivers. The application of IGS and RHI in understanding and presenting the river health condition (RHC) through colored hexagons has been demonstrated for the river Ganga near Varanasi (India) as an example. Identification of critical indicator groups, based on IGS provides a scientific basis for planned intervention for river health restoration to achieve an acceptable category. © 2022",amoxicillin; amphetamine; ampicillin; anticonvulsive agent; azithromycin; caffeine; carbamazepine; central stimulant agent; ciprofloxacin; diclofenac; dissolved oxygen; hydrogen peroxide; ibuprofen; ketoprofen; naproxen; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; norfloxacin; ofloxacin; paracetamol; sparfloxacin; sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim; drug; alga; antibiotic resistance; aquatic environment; dissolved oxygen; drug; fish; macroinvertebrate; manufacturing; nutrient; pollutant; river pollution; wastewater; Advanced Oxidation Process; alcohol withdrawal syndrome; Algae Berger Parker index; antibiotic resistance bacteria; antibiotic resistant bacteria; aquaculture; backache; bioaccumulation; bioremediation; bipolar disorder; calculation; conceptual framework; controlled study; conventional activated sludge; depression; dissociation constant; dissolved oxygen related parameter; drug manufacture; electric conductivity; emerging pollutant; environmental risk; estimated risk quotient; fever; fish; Fish Berger Parker index; headache; Health Assessment Questionnaire; hospital wastewater; Indicator Group Score; macroinvertebrate; mania; measured environmental concentration; nonhuman; nutrient; pain; pharmaceutical care; pharmaceutical pollutant; photodegradation; predicted no effect concentration; removal efficiency; Review; Risk Quotient; river health; river health condition; River Health Index; sludge; solids retention time; symbiosis; tooth pain; turnover rate; volatilization; waste water management; water pollutant; water pollution; water quality; animal; pollutant; river; Godavari River; India; Animals; Caffeine; Environmental Pollutants; Norfloxacin; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Rivers

In EAOPs, electrogenerated oxidizing agents, such as hydroxyl radical (HO•), can react non-selectively with a wide range of organic compounds, degrading and mineralizing their structures to unharmful molecules like CO2, H2O, and inorganic ions. To this date, a broad spectrum of advanced electrocatalysts have been developed and applied for the treatment of compounds of interest in different matrices, specifically aiming at enhancing the degradation performance. New combined methods have also been employed as alternative treatment techniques targeted at circumventing the major obstacles encountered in Fenton-based processes, such as high costs and energy consumption, which still contribute significantly toward inhibiting the large-scale application of these processes. First, some fundamental aspects of EAOPs will be presented.

This study retrospectively evaluated the outcome referable to pain and motor function in these patients. METHODS: All patients had the typical Gilliatt-Sumner hand, secondary to compression of C8, T1, and/or lower trunk. Nineteen patients underwent an anterior supraclavicular approach, and 15 patients underwent a posterior subscapular approach to the brachial plexus. Nerve action potential recordings showed plexus involvement close to the spine, at the level of the junction of the spinal nerves to the lower trunk. RESULTS: Pain, present in 22 patients, improved in 21. Mild motor deficit improved in 12 of 14 patients. Severe motor deficit improved partially in 14 of 20 patients. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of true neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome provides a clear operative indication. Surgical decompression needs to involve the medial portion of the plexus, and especially the spinal nerves. An anterior supraclavicular approach is preferred in most cases. If there is a large cervical rib or there has been a prior anterior operation, then a posterior subscapular approach is indicated.",adolescent; adult; aged; clinical article; controlled study; female; gilliatt sumner hand; human; male; motor dysfunction; nerve decompression; nerve paralysis; nerve plexus; nerve potential; pain; phrenic nerve; postoperative complication; priority journal; retrospective study; review; school child; spinal nerve; surgical approach; thorax outlet syndrome; treatment outcome; Action Potentials; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Female; Humans; Intraoperative Period; Life Change Events; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Conduction; Neurons; Retrospective Studies; Thoracic Outlet Syndrome; Time; Treatment Outcome

Two of them, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are the most known and well investigated. As for many other organic substances that are of environmental concern, the diet is the main route of human exposure to PFAS. However, in certain cases drinking water may also mean a significant contribution to human exposure, and to a lesser extent, dust and air (indoor exposure). In recent years, the environmental persistence of PFAS, their biomagnification in food webs, as well as their potential accumulation and toxicity, have generated a notable interest, which has been evidenced by the considerable number of publications in this regard. Recently, we carried out a wide revision on the levels of PFAS in food and human dietary intake. In the current review, we have summarized the recent information (last 10 years) published in the scientific literature (Scopus and PubMed) on the concentrations of PFAS in drinking water and the human health risks derived from the regular water consumption, when available. A large amount of data belongs to PFOS and PFOA and corresponds to studies mainly conducted in countries of the European Union, USA and China, although no information is available for most countries over the world. According to the toxicological information about PFAS that is so far available, the current health risks for the regular consumers of municipal/tap water do not seem to be of concern according to the levels considered as acceptable for various regulatory institutions. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","drinking water; fluorocarbon; dietary exposure; human; water pollutant; Dietary Exposure; Drinking Water; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The incidence of thyroid cancer appears to be rapidly and steadily increasing in recent decades, and studies have reported thyroid cancer to be the 4th most common cancer today, up from 14th in the early 1990s. This increase is due mainly to a variety of environmental factors, including radiation, smoking, obesity, pollutants such as pesticides, phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluorinated compounds, bromine flame retardants, perchlorates, nitrates and various elements such as metals, non-metals and metalloids. Some metals, including iron, copper, cad mium, lead, vanadium, chromium, manganese and nickel, are positively correlated with thyroid cancer, while others such as zinc and magnesium show a negative correlation. Other metals, such as molybdenum, tin and cobalt, appear to increase the incidence of thyroid cancer in combination, while sodium, mercury, aluminum and silver show no evidence of thyroid carcinogenicity. Of the non-metals, iodine and selenium deficiency are associated with carcinogenic effects on the thyroid, while there is no information on any relevant activity of phosphorus. Among the metalloids, boron is considered a goitrogenic element, and probably increases the incidence of thyroid cancer when it acts in combination with cadmium and molybdenum, taken in small non-toxic doses, for a long time. Finally, air pollution has been studied, and waste gases are associated with an increased incidence of cancer in various anatomical areas, including the thyroid. © Athens Medical Society.",aluminum; antithyroid agent; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; iron; lead; magnesium; manganese; mercury; metal; metalloid; molybdenum; nickel; nitric acid derivative; perchlorate; perfluoro compound; pesticide; phthalic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; silver; sodium; tin; toxic substance; vanadium; zinc; air pollution; cancer mortality; carcinogenicity; endocrine system; environment; environmental factor; human; incidence; iodine deficiency; obesity; radiation; Review; selenium deficiency; smoking; thyroid cancer

The review is an update of a similar, earlier review in this journal [T.A. van Beek, J. Chromatogr. A 967 (2002) 21-55]. Since 2001 over 3000 papers on Ginkgo biloba have appeared, and about 400 of them pertain to chemical analysis in a broad sense and are cited herein. The more important ones are discussed and, where relevant, compared with the best methods published prior to 2002. In the same period over 2500 patents were filed on Ginkgo and the very few related to analysis are mentioned as well. Important constituents include terpene trilactones, i.e. ginkgolide A, B, C, J and bilobalide, flavonol glycosides, biflavones, proanthocyanidins, alkylphenols, simple phenolic acids, 6-hydroxykynurenic acid, 4-O-methylpyridoxine and polyprenols. In the most common so-called ""standardised"" Ginkgo extracts and phytopharmaceuticals several of these classes are no longer present. About 130 new papers deal with the analysis of the terpene trilactones. They are mostly extracted with methanol or water or mixtures thereof. Supercritical fluid extraction and pressurised water extraction are also possible. Sample clean-up is mostly by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate although no sample clean-up at all in combination with LC/MS/MS is gaining in importance. Separation and detection can be routinely carried out by RP-HPLC with ELSD, RI or MS, or by GC/FID or GC/MS after silylation. Hydrolysis followed by LC/MS allows the simultaneous analysis of terpene trilactones and flavonol aglycones. No quantitative procedure for all major flavonol glycosides has yet been published because they are not commercially available. The quantitation of a few available glycosides has been carried out but does not serve a real purpose. After acidic hydrolysis to the aglycones quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin and separation by HPLC, quantitation is straightforward and yields by recalculation an estimation of the original total flavonol glycoside content. A profile of the genuine flavonol glycosides can detect poor storage or adulteration. Although the toxicity of Ginkgo alkylphenols upon oral administration has never been undoubtedly proven, most suppliers limit their content in extracts to 5 ppm and dozens of papers on their analysis were published. One procedure in which a methanolic extract is directly injected on a C8 HPLC column appears superior in terms of sensitivity (<5 ppm), separation, simplicity and validation and will be incorporated in the European Pharmacopoeia. Alternatively GC/MS and ELISA methods can be used. A sharp contrast to the plethora of papers on terpene trilactones, flavonol glycosides, and ginkgolic acids forms the low number of papers on biflavones, proanthocyanidins, simple phenolics, simple acids, and other constituents that make up the remaining 70% of Ginkgo standardised extracts. More research in this direction is clearly needed. For the analysis of Ginkgo proanthocyanidins (7%) for instance, no reliable assays are yet existing. Finally the growing literature on pharmacokinetic and fingerprinting studies of Ginkgo is briefly summarised. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Although overexploitation and habitat degradation are the two biggest threats to batoid populations, coastal and oceanic pollution is also a pervasive potential threat. In this systematic review, we compile published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea superorder and present contamination patterns, exposure effects, and potential human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found batoids to accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Accumulation of POPs is reported for chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Hg levels in muscle tissue were significantly different among oceanic basins and habitats, consistent with previous global assessments of Hg oceanic background levels. Some batoid species presented Hg levels higher than large pelagic teleost fishes and comparable to sharks. Ecological traits such as, bottom feeding, upper trophic position and elasmobranch-specific physiology and metabolism are discussed as potential factors associated with Hg uptake and accumulation in batoids. Some species exceeded USEPA's maximum contamination safety limits in edible tissues for Hg, As and ΣPCBs. For most trace metals and POPs, there is a lack of studies focusing on contamination levels in batoids. We recommend future research increasing reporting on POPs and trace metals besides Hg in batoids to further investigate the role of Elasmobranch as a bioindicator for marine pollution. © 2019 Elsevier LtdWe surveyed literature on 65 batoids species and found a large range of reported inorganic and organic contaminants at levels below food safety limits, except for Hg, As and PCB. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical contamination; Contamination; Ecosystems; Insecticides; Marine pollution; Mercury (metal); Metals; Pollution; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Tissue; Trace elements; Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane; Elasmobranch; Inorganic contaminants; Organochlorines; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Persistent organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB); Organic pollutants; alkyl group; arsenic acid; bismuth; cadmium; chlordane; chlorphenotane; chromium; cobalt; copper; dieldrin; heptachlor epoxide; hexachlorobenzene; iron; lead; manganese; mercury; nickel; palladium; perfluoro compound; platinum; polychlorinated biphenyl; rhodium; rubidium; selenium; strontium; tin; trace metal; unindexed drug; vanadium; zinc; chlorinated hydrocarbon; environmental marker; heavy metal; trace element; bioindicator; chemical pollutant; literature review; marine pollution; mercury (element); organochlorine; persistent organic pollutant; pollution exposure; shark; teleost; trace metal; bioaccumulation; cartilaginous fish; concentration (parameter); egg; egg yolk; environmental exposure; fin (organ); foraging; geographical variation (species); gill; health hazard; intestine tissue; kidney tissue; liver tissue; muscle; nonhuman; ovum; persistent organic pollutant; pollution transport; population exposure; Review; systematic review; tissue level; water contamination; analysis; animal; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; human; metabolism; procedures; skate (fish); water pollutant; Batoidea; Chondrichthyes; Dasyatidae; Rhinobatidae; Teleostei; Animals; Ecosystem; Environmental Biomarkers; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Metals, Heavy; Skates (Fish); Trace Elements; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Contaminant abatement in UV-ARP is most often accomplished through reaction with hydrated electrons (eaq-) produced from UV photolysis of chemical sensitizers (e.g., sulfite). In this Review, we evaluate the photochemical kinetics, substrate scope, and optimization of UV-ARP. We find that quantities typically reported in photochemical studies of natural and engineered systems are under-reported in the UV-ARP literature, especially the formation rates, scavenging capacities, and concentrations of key reactive species like eaq-. The absence of these quantities has made it difficult to fully evaluate the impact of operating conditions and the role of water matrix components on the efficiencies of UV-ARP. The UV-ARP substrate scope is weighted heavily toward contaminant classes that are resistant to degradation by advanced oxidation processes, like oxyanions and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Some studies have sought to optimize the UV-ARP treatment of these contaminants; however, a thorough evaluation of the impact of water matrix components like dissolved organic matter on these optimization strategies is needed. Overall, the data compilation, analysis, and research recommendations provided in this Review will assist the UV-ARP research community in future efforts toward optimizing UV-ARP systems, modeling the eaq-based chemical transformation kinetics, and developing new UV-ARP systems. ©",NA

The presence of the so‐called emerging pollutants in the different water bodies, impossible to eliminate through conventional biological and physical treatments used in wastewater treatment plants due to their persistent and recalcitrant nature, means that pollution continues growing throughout the world. The presence of these emerging pollutants involves serious risks to human and animal health for aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Therefore, in recent years, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been postulated as a viable, innovative and efficient technology for the elimination of these types of compounds from water bodies. The oxidation/reduction reactions triggered in most of these processes require a suitable catalyst. The most recent research focuses on the use and development of different types of heterogeneous catalysts, which are capable of overcoming some of the operational limitations of homogeneous processes such as the generation of metallic sludge, difficult separation of treated water and narrow working pH. This review details the current advances in the field of heterogeneous AOPs, Fenton processes and photocatalysts for the removal of different types of emerging pollutants. © 2022 by the authors.

The interaction between endometrium and peritoneum has been studied in an in-vitro model using amnion, peritoneum and mesothelial cells in culture on the one hand and cyclic and menstrual endometrium on the other hand. The results of these studies indicate that(i) an intact mesothelial lining prevents adhesion of shed endometrial tissue, (ii) shed endometrial tissue adheres to the peritoneal extracellular matrix and (iii) menstrual effluent creates its own adhesion sites by damaging the mesothelial lining thus exposing the extracellular matrix.

Two ACAT isoforms, termed ACAT1 and ACAT2, have been described. ACAT1 is ubiquitously found, with high expression levels in macrophages, adrenals, sebaceous glands and foam cells from human atherosclerotic lesions. In contrast, ACAT2 expression is restricted to the intestine and the liver of mice and non-human primates. The reaction catalyzed by ACAT is essential for intestinal cholesterol absorption, synthesis and secretion of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins, and intracellular storage of cholesterol. Therefore, ACAT inhibitors would theoretically reduce plasma cholesterol levels by blocking cholesterol absorption from the diet and by reducing hepatic VLDL synthesis. Moreover, ACAT inhibition could limit the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in the cytoplasm of macrophages, thus reducing the formation of foam cells. In view of these attractive possibilities, a great deal of molecules with ACAT inhibitory properties have been synthesized in the last 20 years. However, only a few of them have reached clinical studies, mainly due to unexpected side effects. On the other hand, most of the compounds assayed in humans have not shown substantial hypolipidemic efficacy. The present article focuses on the current knowledge of the pharmacology of ACAT inhibitors, and, specifically, on the different pharmacological approaches used to evaluate these compounds as hypolipidemic and antiatherosclerotic agents. © 2004 Prous Science.

In comparison with classical FCs and given their lower electrochemical performances, BioFCs have, up to now, only found niche applications with low power needs, but they could become a green solution in the perspective of sustainable development and the circular economy. Ion exchange membranes for utilization in BioFCs are discussed in the final section of the review: they include perfluorinated proton exchange membranes but also aromatic polymers grafted with proton or anion exchange groups. © 2022 by the authors.

In order to achieve such properties, different fabrication strategies can be followed. Up to now, several reviews have been published that focus and investigate each of these concepts individually without giving an entire overview of all the existing approaches for achieving oil-repellency. In this review pertaining to advances and developments since 2011, we summarise progress on fabrication, design and understanding of all the existing concepts for obtaining materials that are oil-repellent including smooth oleophobic materials, textured superoleophobic and superomniphobic surfaces, and lubricated porous/textured substrates. In each of these categories, we highlight the most successful methods to produce oil-repellent surfaces while their applications are also demonstrated. Finally, recent studies and new trends focusing on the development of oilrepellent materials by following more environmentally friendly routes such as the use of shortchain or even no perfluorinated compounds, but also fabrication methods that do not involve the use of hazardous or flammable solvents, are also discussed. © 2016 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining and ASM International Published by Taylor & Francis for the Institute and ASM International.",Fabrication designs; Fabrication strategies; Novel materials; Oil repellency; Oleophobic; Property; Self cleaning; Superoleophobic; Superomniphobic; Textured substrates; Substrates
NA,Uptake and accumulation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in plants,2020,NA,NA,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a class of persistent organic contaminants that are ubiquitous in the environment and have been found to be accumulated in agricultural products. Consumption of PFAS-contaminated agricultural products represents a feasible pathway for the trophic transfer of these toxic chemicals along food chains/webs, leading to risks associated with human and animal health. Recently, studies on plant uptake and accumulation of PFASs have rapidly increased; consequently, a review to summarize the current knowledge and highlight future research is needed. Analysis of the publications indicates that a large variety of plant species can take up PFASs from the environment. Vegetables and grains are the most commonly investigated crops, with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) as the most studied PFASs. The potential sources of PFASs for plant uptake include industrial emissions, irrigation with contaminated water, land application of biosolids, leachates from landfill sites, and pesticide application. Root uptake is the predominant pathway for the accumulation of PFASs in agricultural crops, and uptake by plant aboveground portions from the ambient atmosphere could play a minor role in the overall PFAS accumulation. PFAS uptake by plants is influenced by physicochemical properties of compounds (e.g., perfluorocarbon chain length, head group functionality, water solubility, and volatility), plant physiology (e.g., transpiration rate, lipid and protein content), and abiotic factors (e.g., soil organic matters, pH, salinity, and temperature). Based on literature analysis, the current knowledge gaps are identified, and future research prospects are suggested. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",NA

Modern-day ICD systems use transvenous high-voltage leads to act as the interface between the heart and the generator, allowing for the sensing of a cardiac activity and the delivery of both bradycardia and tachycardia therapy, including high-voltage, high-current shocks. The ICD lead is in many ways the most fragile and critical component of the ICD system, and is subjected to more stress than any other implanted medical device. It has similar components to a pacing lead including tip and ring electrodes, fixation mechanism, conductors, insulators, and connector pins. In addition, it also contains the high-voltage shock coils that allow the delivery of defibrillation therapy to the cardiac tissue. The materials used to manufacture each of these components have undergone little evolution from their initial pacing lead-derived origin, but promising progress in this area is now occurring and better conductors and insulators have been developed. Lead body design continues to be multiluminal rather than coaxial, but various iterations of this basic paradigm continue to be investigated. In addition to miniaturization of the entire ICD lead, new industry standard lead connectors will also be introduced to reduce complexity and pocket bulk. However, long-term failure rates have been considerable, with lead failure related to both conductor and insulator malfunction. It is hoped that recent improvements in an ICD lead design and manufacture will result in a good functionality with a reliable long-term performance.

Progress in rice cultivars with improved tolerance has been hampered by a poor understanding of Fe availability in the soil, the transportation mechanism, and associated genetic factors for the tolerance of Fe toxicity soil (FTS) or Fe deficiency soil (FDS) conditions. In the past, through conventional breeding approaches, rice varieties were developed especially suitable for low- and high-pH soils, which indirectly helped the varieties to tolerate FTS and FDS conditions. Rice-Fe interactions in the external environment of soil, internal homeostasis, and transportation have been studied extensively in the past few decades. However, the molecular and physiological mechanisms of Fe uptake and transport need to be characterized in response to the tolerance of morpho-physiological traits under Fe-toxic and -deficient soil conditions, and these traits need to be well integrated into breeding programs. A deeper understanding of the several factors that influence Fe absorption, uptake, and transport from soil to root and above-ground organs under FDS and FTS is needed to develop tolerant rice cultivars with improved grain yield. Therefore, the objective of this review paper is to congregate the different phenotypic screening methodologies for prospecting tolerant rice varieties and their responsible genetic traits, and Fe homeostasis related to all the known quantitative trait loci (QTLs), genes, and transporters, which could offer enormous information to rice breeders and biotechnologists to develop rice cultivars tolerant of Fe toxicity or deficiency. The mechanism of Fe regulation and transport from soil to grain needs to be understood in a systematic manner along with the cascade of metabolomics steps that are involved in the development of rice varieties tolerant of FTS and FDS. Therefore, the integration of breeding with advanced genome sequencing and omics technologies allows for the fine-tuning of tolerant genotypes on the basis of molecular genetics, and the further identification of novel genes and transporters that are related to Fe regulation from FTS and FDS conditions is incredibly important to achieve further success in this aspect. © 2019 by the authors.

NA,Environmental chemicals and breast cancer: An updated review of epidemiological literature informed by biological mechanisms,2018,NA,NA,"Background Many common environmental chemicals are mammary gland carcinogens in animal studies, activate relevant hormonal pathways, or enhance mammary gland susceptibility to carcinogenesis. Breast cancer's long latency and multifactorial etiology make evaluation of these chemicals in humans challenging. Objective For chemicals previously identified as mammary gland toxicants, we evaluated epidemiologic studies published since our 2007 review. We assessed whether study designs captured relevant exposures and disease features suggested by toxicological and biological evidence of genotoxicity, endocrine disruption, tumor promotion, or disruption of mammary gland development. Methods We systematically searched the PubMed database for articles with breast cancer outcomes published in 2006–2016 using terms for 134 environmental chemicals, sources, or biomarkers of exposure. We critically reviewed the articles. Results We identified 158 articles. Consistent with experimental evidence, a few key studies suggested higher risk for exposures during breast development to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dioxins, perfluorooctane-sulfonamide (PFOSA), and air pollution (risk estimates ranged from 2.14 to 5.0), and for occupational exposure to solvents and other mammary carcinogens, such as gasoline components (risk estimates ranged from 1.42 to 3.31). Notably, one 50-year cohort study captured exposure to DDT during several critical windows for breast development (in utero, adolescence, pregnancy) and when this chemical was still in use. Most other studies did not assess exposure during a biologically relevant window or specify the timing of exposure. Few studies considered genetic variation, but the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project reported higher breast cancer risk for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in women with certain genetic variations, especially in DNA repair genes. Conclusions New studies that targeted toxicologically relevant chemicals and captured biological hypotheses about genetic variants or windows of breast susceptibility added to evidence of links between environmental chemicals and breast cancer. However, many biologically relevant chemicals, including current-use consumer product chemicals, have not been adequately studied in humans. Studies are challenged to reconstruct exposures that occurred decades before diagnosis or access biological samples stored that long. Other problems include measuring rapidly metabolized chemicals and evaluating exposure to mixtures. © 2017 The Authors",NA

Coronary patency rates as high as 85% assessed by angiography 90 minutes after initiation of treatment greatly overestimate the efficacy of thrombolytic regimens, as this conventional angiographic 'snapshot' view does not satisfactorily reflect the dynamic processes of coronary artery recanalization and reocclusion or the adequacy of myocardial perfusion. In fact, only the unusual patient appears to achieve optimal reperfusion for acute myocardial infarction, with a substantial deterioration of benefit in many patients due to insufficiently early or rapid recanalization, incomplete patency with TIMI grade 2 flow or critical residual coronary stenoses, absence of myocardial tissue reflow despite epicardial artery patency, intermittent coronary patency, subsequent reocclusion, or reperfusion injury. Recently developed techniques to critically assess the quality of reperfusion, coupled with the introduction of novel pharmacological agents and an improved understanding of the roles and mechanisms of existing thrombolytic and adjunctive drugs, have provided the opportunity to overcome many of the present limitations of reperfusion therapy. Emerging strategies to achieve optimal reperfusion are directed at enhancement of the velocity and quality of thrombolysis, amelioration of the adverse effects of reperfusion, and use of alternative pathways to myocardial salvage.",acetylcysteine; acetylsalicylic acid; adenosine; alteplase; anistreplase; antithrombin iii; antithrombocytic agent; argatroban; basic fibroblast growth factor; blood clotting factor 10a; catalase; fibrin; fibrinogen; fibrinolytic agent; heparin; lepirudin; oxygen radical; perfluoro compound; streptokinase; superoxide dismutase; thrombin; tissue plasminogen activator; urokinase; acute heart infarction; angiocardiography; brain hemorrhage; coronary artery collateral circulation; coronary artery dilatation; coronary artery obstruction; coronary artery recanalization; coronary blood vessel; electrocardiogram; fibrinolytic therapy; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart muscle reperfusion; human; intravenous drug administration; mortality; nonhuman; priority journal; prognosis; review; st segment elevation; thrombocyte aggregation; thrombogenesis; thrombosis

These are: caproic (C6), caprylic (C8), capric (C10), and lauric (C12) acids. They can be partly absorbed already through the stomach mucosa. Their triacylglycerols (MCT) can be absorbed intact into intestinal epithelial enterocytes and then hydrolysed by microsomal lipases. Thus they are a readily available source of energy, capable of improving the intestinal epithelial mucosal structure. They are also characterised by strong antibacterial activity due to their ability to penetrate the semi-permeable membranes of bacteria and damage their internal structures. Thanks to these properties, they could be a good supplement to weaned piglet feed.

Recent Findings: Eleven human studies published before April 1st, 2021 were identified through database searches (PubMed, Dimensions, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus), and citation chaining (Citationchaser). The sample sizes of these studies ranged from 40 to 965, involving children and adolescents (n = 3), non-pregnant adults (n = 5), or pregnant women (n = 3). High-resolution liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was the primary analytical platform to measure both PFAS and metabolome. PFAS were measured in either plasma (n = 6) or serum (n = 5), while metabolomic profiles were assessed using plasma (n = 6), serum (n = 4), or urine (n = 1). Four types of PFAS (perfluorooctane sulfonate (n = 11), perfluorooctanoic acid (n = 10), perfluorohexane sulfonate (n = 9), perfluorononanoic acid (n = 5)) and PFAS mixtures (n = 7) were the most studied. We found that alterations to tryptophan metabolism and the urea cycle were most reported PFAS-associated metabolomic signatures. Numerous lipid metabolites were also suggested to be associated with PFAS exposure, especially key metabolites in glycerophospholipid metabolism which is critical for biological membrane functions, and fatty acids and carnitines which are relevant to the energy supply pathway of fatty acid oxidation. Other important metabolome changes reported included the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle regarding energy generation, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism in cellular energy systems. Conclusions: There is growing interest in using non-targeted metabolomics to study the human physiological changes associated with PFAS exposure. Multiple PFAS were reported to be associated with alterations in amino acid and lipid metabolism, but these results are driven by one predominant type of pathway analysis thus require further confirmation. Standardizing research methods and reporting are recommended to facilitate result comparison. Future studies should consider potential differences in study methodology, use of prospective design, and influence from confounding bias and measurement errors. © 2022",Amino acids; Biomolecules; Cytology; Fatty acids; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; Organic pollutants; Physiology; Search engines; Urea; Epidemiological studies; Exposome; Human study; Metabolic pathways; Metabolomes; Metabolomics; Non-targeted; Perfluorinated compounds; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Scoping review; Metabolism; carnitine; fatty acid; glycerophospholipid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; purine; pyrimidine; tricarboxylic acid; tryptophan; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; epidemiology; fatty acid; lipid; metabolism; metabolite; oxidation; persistent organic pollutant; physiology; adolescent; adult; aged; amino acid metabolism; biomembrane; blood analysis; cell energy; citric acid cycle; comparative study; energy resource; environmental exposure; epidemiology; fatty acid oxidation; female; human; lipid metabolism; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; metabolic regulation; metabolomics; middle aged; pregnant woman; publication; purine metabolism; pyrimidine metabolism; Review; sample size; urea cycle; urinalysis; child; metabolomics; pollutant; pregnancy; prospective study; Adolescent; Adult; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Child; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Metabolomics; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies

One quarter of all agrochemicals was chiral in 1996, and this proportion has increased remarkably with the introduction of new compounds over time. Despite scientists have made great efforts to probe the enantiomeric selectivity of chiral chemicals in the environment since early 1990s, the different behaviours of individual enantiomers in biologically mediated processes are still unclear. In the present review, we highlight state-of-the-knowledge on the stereoselective biotransformation and accumulation of chiral contaminants in organisms ranging from invertebrates to humans.

It is suitable for various climate conditions due to its low boiling point (-64 °C). Therefore, it has been widely used in power grid equipment. However, its global warming potential (GWP) is 23,500 times higher than that of CO2. Thus, it is imperative to find an environmentally friendly insulating gas with excellent insulation performance, lower GWP, and which is harmless to equipment and workers to replace SF6. In this review, four possible alternatives, including perfluorocarbons, trifluoroiodomethane, perfluorinated ketones, and fluoronitrile are reviewed in terms of basic physicochemical properties, insulation properties, decomposition properties, and compatibility with metals. The influences of trace H2O or O2 on their insulation performances are also discussed. The insulation strengths of these insulating gases were comparable to or higher than that of SF6. The GWPs of these insulating gases were lower than that of SF6. Due to their relatively high boiling point, they should be used as a mixture with buffering gases with low boiling points. Based on these four characteristics, perfluorinated ketones (C5F10O and C6F12O) and fluoronitrile (C4F7N) could partially substitute SF6 in some electrical equipment.

With the discovery of crescentin, a cell-shape-determining protein that resembles eukaryotic intermediate filament proteins, the third major cytoskeletal element has now been identified in bacteria as well.","actin; bacterial protein; cell protein; crescentin; cytoskeleton protein; FtsZ protein; MinC protein; MinD protein; MreB protein; protein DivVIA; protein EzrA; protein FtsA; protein MinE; protein noc; protein ParM; protein SetB; protein SulA; protein ZapA; protein ZipA; tubulin; unclassified drug; amino acid sequence; Bacillus subtilis; bacterial cell; cell division; cell membrane; cell shape; cell structure; cell survival; cytoskeleton; Escherichia coli; eukaryote; fluorescence microscopy; gene deletion; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein function; protein structure; review; sequence homology; structure analysis; Actins; Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Physiology; Cytoskeleton; DNA; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Guanosine Diphosphate; Microscopy, Electron; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Bacillus subtilis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Eukaryota; Sula"

Despite their effects on this critical and conserved machinery of cellular energetics, they have good to excellent mammalian safety. These compounds include several lipophilic nitrogen heterocycles (e.g. fenazaquin, pyridaben and fenpyroximate) that act as acaricides by inhibiting electron transport at Complex I. An important new group of fungicides derived from the fungal secondary metabolite, stobilurin, inhibit electron transport between cytochromes b and c1 in Complex III. The thiourea insecticide, diafenthiuron, is activated metabolically to a carbodiimide that blocks ATP synthase. It also reacts with a residue on insect porin (the voltage-dependent anion channel) in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Finally, several new pesticidal uncouplers have been introduced. These include the pyrrole insecticide, chlorfenapyr, the diarylamine fungicide/acaricide, fluazinam, and the perfluorooctanesulfonamide insecticide, sulfluramid.

This process has been extensively used to effect substitution on a wide variety of substrates. The SRN1 reaction has been studied from both mechanistic and synthetic standpoints. The SRN1 mechanism requires an initiation step. Spontaneous electron transfer (ET) from the nucleophile to the substrate has been observed in a few systems; light stimulation, electrodes, alkali metals or inorganic salt-mediation is used otherwise. There are systems that are totally inert or undergo rather slow substitutions by classical polar mechanisms. Their lack of reactivity is usually due to strain (cycloalkyl and polycycloalkyl halides), steric (cycloalkyl, polycycloalkyl and neopentyl halides), or electronic factors (unactivated aromatic, vinyl halides and perfluoroalkyl halides). For these families of compounds, the nucleophilic substitution can be accomplished by the SRN1 mechanism. Conversely, there is a class of substrates, for which substitution can be achieved through both polar and ET mechanisms; however, the ET pathway is favored in some systems (i.e.: alkyl halides with EWG). We propose to undertake a compilation and critical review on SRN1 reactions dealing with substitutions on aromatic substrates, cycloalkyl, bridgehead, neopentyl, vinyl halides, perfluoroalkyl iodides, aliphatic substrates with EWG in the α position and N,N-dialkyl-p-toluenesulfonamides.

Under normal physiological conditions, angiogenesis is well balanced and controlled by endogenous proangiogenic factors and antiangiogenic factors. However, factors produced by cancer cells, cancer stem cells and other cell types in the tumor stroma can disrupt the balance so that the tumor microenvironment favors tumor angiogenesis. These factors include vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial tissue factor and other membrane bound receptors that mediate multiple intracellular signaling pathways that contribute to tumor angiogenesis. Though environmental exposures to certain chemicals have been found to initiate and promote tumor development, the role of these exposures (particularly to low doses of multiple substances), is largely unknown in relation to tumor angiogenesis. This review summarizes the evidence of the role of environmental chemical bioactivity and exposure in tumor angiogenesis and carcinogenesis. We identify a number of ubiquitous (prototypical) chemicals with disruptive potential that may warrant further investigation given their selectivity for high-throughput screening assay targets associated with proangiogenic pathways. We also consider the cross-hallmark relationships of a number of important angiogenic pathway targets with other cancer hallmarks and we make recommendations for future research. Understanding of the role of low-dose exposure of chemicals with disruptive potential could help us refine our approach to cancer risk assessment, and may ultimately aid in preventing cancer by reducing or eliminating exposures to synergistic mixtures of chemicals with carcinogenic potential. © The Author 2015.

Using such a strategy, a myriad of valuable partially fluorinated products can be prepared, which otherwise are difficult to make by the conventional C-F bond formation methods. Visible light photoredox catalysis has been proven as an important and powerful tool for defluorinative reactions due to its mild, easy to handle, and environmentally benign characteristics. Compared to the classical C-F activation that proceeds via two-electron processes, radicals are the key intermediates using visible light photoredox catalysis, providing new modes for the cleavage of C-F bonds. In this review, a summary of the visible light-promoted C-F bond cleavage since 2018 was presented.

Understanding the role that chemicals in our environment play in the development of these conditions is an emerging issue in environmental health, although identifying and prioritizing chemicals for testing beyond those already implicated in the literature is challenging. This review is intended to help researchers generate hypotheses about chemicals that may contribute to diabetes and to obesity-related health outcomes by summarizing relevant findings from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ToxCast™ high-throughput screening (HTS) program. oBjectives: Our aim was to develop new hypotheses around environmental chemicals of potential interest for diabetes-or obesity-related outcomes using high-throughput screening data. Methods: We identified ToxCast™ assay targets relevant to several biological processes related to diabetes and obesity (insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissue, pancreatic islet and β cell function, adipocyte differentiation, and feeding behavior) and presented chemical screening data against those assay targets to identify chemicals of potential interest. discussion: The results of this screening-level analysis suggest that the spectrum of environmental chemicals to consider in research related to diabetes and obesity is much broader than indicated by research papers and reviews published in the peer-reviewed literature. Testing hypotheses based on ToxCast™ data will also help assess the predictive utility of this HTS platform. conclusions: More research is required to put these screening-level analyses into context, but the information presented in this review should facilitate the development of new hypotheses. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

In addition, previous dose-response assessments have focused primarily on evidence from animal studies. This critical review summarizes peer reviewed epidemiological studies on PFOA and cancers of the kidneys and testes, using modified Hill’s criteria to assess the evidence for causation. We converted exposures to a common scale based on serum PFOA concentrations and applied meta-analysis to estimate the average increase in cancer risk reported by the studies with sufficient information to estimate serum PFOA. Using random effects meta-analysis, we found that the average relative increase in cancer risk per 10 ng/mL increase in serum PFOA for these studies is 16% (95% CI: 3%, 30%) for kidney cancer and 3% (95% CI: 2%, 4%) for testicular cancer. These associations are most likely causal, but results are limited by the small number of studies for testicular cancer, the overlapping study populations for several studies, and the lack of measured or modeled serum PFOA concentrations for several studies.

Considerable validation of this technology has been performed at both the bench-scale and pilot-scale, which has been facilitated by the development of stable electrode materials that efficiently generate high yields of hydroxyl radicals (OH) (e.g., boron-doped diamond (BDD), doped-SnO 2, PbO2, and substoichiometic- and doped-TiO2). Although a promising new technology, the mechanisms involved in the oxidation of organic compounds during EAOPs and the corresponding environmental impacts of their use have not been fully addressed. In order to unify the state of knowledge, identify research gaps, and stimulate new research in these areas, this review critically analyses published research pertaining to EAOPs. Specific topics covered in this review include (1) EAOP electrode types, (2) oxidation pathways of select classes of contaminants, (3) rate limitations in applied settings, and (4) long-term sustainability. Key challenges facing EAOP technologies are related to toxic byproduct formation (e.g., ClO 4- and halogenated organic compounds) and low electro-active surface areas. These challenges must be addressed in future research in order for EAOPs to realize their full potential for water treatment. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.",acetic acid; boron; diamond; formic acid; iridium; lead; niobium; organic carbon; organic compound; oxalic acid; oxygen; perfluoro compound; phenol derivative; tin; titanium; titanium dioxide; water; adsorption; advection; aqueous solution; chemical reaction; corrosion; crystal structure; electric conductivity; electrochemical advanced oxidation process; electrochemical analysis; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; electrochemistry; electrode; electron transport; environmental impact; hydrophobicity; oxidation; oxygen evolution; packed bed reactor; priority journal; reaction analysis; reduction; review; scanning electrochemical microscopy; waste water management; Boron; Diamond; Electrodes; Oxidation-Reduction; Water Pollutants; Water Purification

This review presents the current state of knowledge on the metabolic pathways of NSAIDs in organisms at various levels of biological organisation. More than 150 publications dealing with target or non-target analysis of selected NSAIDs (mainly diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen) were collected. The metabolites of phase I and phase II are presented. The similarity of NSAIDs metabolism to that in mammals was observed in bacteria, microalgae, fungi, higher plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. The differences, such as newly detected metabolites, the extracellular metabolism observed in bacteria and fungi, or phase III metabolism in plants, are highlighted. Metabolites detected in plants (conjugates with sugars and amino acids) but not found in any other organisms are described. Selected, in-depth studies with isolated bacterial strains showed the possibility of transforming NSAIDs into assimilable carbon sources. It has been found that some of the metabolites show higher toxicity than their parent forms. The presence of metabolites of NSAIDs in the environment is the cumulative effect of their introduction with wastewaters, their formation in wastewater treatment plants, and their transformation by non-target wild-living organisms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic organisms; Bacteria; Biomolecules; Fungi; Mammals; Metabolites; Physiology; Soils; Wastewater treatment; 'current; Biotransformation product; Emerging pollutants; Exposed to; Living organisms; Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; Pharmaceutical metabolite; Pharmaceutical removal; Soil organisms; Trace level; Metabolism; 1,2,4 benzenetriol; amino acid; amitriptyline; anthranilic acid; anthranilic acid derivative; biosurfactant; carbohydrate; carboxylic acid; carotenoid; catalase; catechol 1,2 dioxygenase; catechol derivative; cytochrome P450 1A; cytochrome P450 1A1; cytochrome P450 2C; diclofenac; diflunisal; flurbiprofen; gentisic acid; glucoside; glutathione; glutathione reductase; glutathione transferase; ibuprofen; imipramine; indometacin; ketoprofen; laccase; levofloxacin; lignin; lignin peroxidase; mefenamic acid; muconic acid; naproxen; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; phenylacetic acid; protocatechuic acid; quercetin; reactive oxygen metabolite; salicylate sodium; superoxide dismutase; testosterone; drug; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; bacterium; biotransformation; drug; fungus; metabolism; nontarget organism; toxicity; wild population; Actinomyces; acute toxicity; Acutodesmus obliquus; Aliivibrio fischeri; aquatic environment; Arabidopsis thaliana; Bacillus subtilis; Bacillus thuringiensis; bacterial genome; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bioaccumulation; biodegradability; biodegradation; biofilm; bioremediation; biotransformation; Brevibacillus; carbon source; carboxylation; chemical mutagenesis; chemical oxygen demand; Chlorella sorokiniana; Chlorella vulgaris; Comamonadaceae; cyanobacterium; Daphnia magna; dealkylation; dechlorination; deoxygenation; dihydroxylation; Dreissena polymorpha; drug metabolism; EC50; ecotoxicity; enzyme activity; enzyme specificity; enzyme synthesis; filamentous fungus; Gammaproteobacteria; Gammarus pulex; gene expression; Geobacter metallireducens; glycosylation; high performance liquid chromatography; LC50; limit of detection; lipid peroxidation; liver injury; marine environment; metabolomics; methanogenesis; microbial community; microbial degradation; minimum inhibitory concentration; Mytilus galloprovincialis; Nicotiana tabacum; nonhuman; Oreochromis niloticus; oxidative stress; oxygen consumption; photosynthesis; phytotoxicity; proteomics; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Review; Rhodococcus erythropolis; risk assessment; Salmo trutta; soil pollution; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; Streptomyces griseus; toxicity testing; Trametes versicolor; ultra performance liquid chromatography; upregulation; vascular plant; waste water treatment plant; wild species; zebra fish; animal; Bacteria (microorganisms); Embryophyta; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Vertebrata; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Diclofenac; Ibuprofen; Naproxen; Pharmaceutical Preparations"

However, the microporous structure of conventional zeolite materials limits their applications to small-molecule reactions. To alleviate this problem, mesoporous zeolitic frameworks were developed. In the last few decades, several methods have been developed for the synthesis of mesoporous zeolites; these zeolites have demonstrated greater lifetime and better performance than their bulk microporous counterparts in many catalytic processes, which can be explained by the rapid diffusion of reactant species into the zeolite framework and facile accessibility to bulky molecules through the mesopores. Mesoporous zeolites provide versatile opportunities not only in conventional chemical industries but also in emerging catalysis fields. This review presents many state-of-the-art mesoporous zeolites, discusses various strategies for their synthesis, and details their contributions to catalytic reactions including catalytic cracking, isomerization, alkylation and acylation, alternative fuel synthesis via methanol-to-hydrocarbon (MTH) and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) routes, and different fine-chemical syntheses. © 2021 by the authors.

Understanding generational shifts is especially important given the coming retirement of Baby Boomer workers and their replacement by those born after 1982 (GenMe/GenY/Millennials). Findings: Most studies, including the few time-lag studies, show that GenX and especially GenMe rate work as less central to their lives, value leisure more, and express a weaker work ethic than Boomers and Silents. Extrinsic work values (e.g., salary) are higher in GenMe and especially GenX. Contrary to popular conceptions, there were no generational differences in altruistic values (e.g., wanting to help others). Conflicting results appeared in desire for job stability, intrinsic values (e.g., meaning), and social/affiliative values (e.g., making friends). GenX, and especially GenMe are consistently higher in individualistic traits. Overall, generational differences are important where they appear, as even small changes at the average mean that twice or three times as many individuals score at the top of the distribution. Implications: To recruit GenMe, companies should focus on work-life balance issues and flexible schedules. Programs based on volunteering, altruistic values, social values, or meaning in work will likely be no more successful than they were for previous generations.

However, very few studies have focused on modeling PFAS in the soil-water environment. In this review, we summarized the recent development in PFAS modeling for various chemical, physical, and biological processes, including sorption, volatilization, degradation, bioaccumulation, and transport. PFAS sorption is kinetic in nature with sorption equilibrium commonly quantified by either a linear, the Freundlich, or the Langmuir isotherms. Volatilization of PFAS depends on carbon chain length and ionization status and has been simulated by a two-layer diffusion process across the air water interface. First-order kinetics is commonly used for physical, chemical, and biological degradation processes. Uptake by plants and other biota can be passive and/or active. As surfactants, PFAS have a tendency to be sorbed or concentrated on air-water or non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL)-water interfaces, where the same three isotherms for soil sorption are adopted. PFAS transport in the soil-water environment is simulated by solving the convection-dispersion equation (CDE) that is coupled to PFAS sorption, phase transfer, as well as physical, chemical, and biological transformations. As the physicochemical properties and concentration vary greatly among the potentially thousands of PFAS species in the environment, systematic efforts are needed to identify models and model parameters to simulate their fate, transport, and response to remediation techniques. Since many process formulations are empirical in nature, mechanistic approaches are needed to further the understanding of PFAS-soil-water-plant interactions so that the model parameters are less site dependent and more predictive in simulating PFAS remediation efficiency. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Air; Biochemistry; Degradation; Ionization of liquids; Isotherms; Physicochemical properties; Remediation; Soil moisture; Solute transport; Sorption; Air water interfaces; Biological degradation; Biological transformation; Convection-dispersion equations; First order kinetics; Nonaqueous phase liquids; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Remediation efficiency; Phase interfaces; carbon; organofluorine derivative; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; surfactant; unclassified drug; water; critical analysis; diffusion; hydrological modeling; reaction kinetics; soil remediation; soil water; soil-vegetation interaction; sorption; transport process; volatilization; air; bioaccumulation; bioremediation; biotransformation; concentration (parameter); degradation; desorption; diffusion; dispersion; ionization; isotherm; Michaelis Menten kinetics; physical chemistry; priority journal; Review; simulation; soil; thermodynamics; volatilization

Fluorinated surfactants are a major PFAS subgroup. Their widespread use has resulted in their release into the environment and accumulation in water. The sequestration of PFAS from aqueous solution by adsorption is a pressing and challenging environmental pollution problem which necessitates surface and colloid science to offer solutions for the benefit of a sustainable future. In this review, we first provide an overview of the aqueous solution and self-assembly properties of common PFAS surfactants. Next, we discuss physical adsorption of PFAS surfactants, which is the first step used to concentrate PFAS prior to their subsequent proper disposal or destruction, with a focus on “natural” materials such as activated carbon and biopolymers, and on surfactant/surface/colloid aspects.

Ober W.B.,Experimental toxemia of pregnancy: review and speculation,1977,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0017587124&partnerID=40&md5=a4806bcb36ec438e48526828115e38a4,"After an accurate review of experimental and clinical research on toxemia, the author concludes: the placenta is the primary organ in the pathogenesis of pregnancy toxemia, preeclampsia and eclampsia, thereby confirming the ideas Young so clearly stated in 1914. Most clinical and experimental data indicate that reduced uteroplacental blood flow and attendant placental ischemia mark the critical point for development of symptoms and lesions. The hypothesis carries with it the idea that substances from the damaged placenta are returned via uterine veins to the maternal organism and that these substances cause elevation of systolic and diastolic pressure, proteinuria secondary to glomerular lesions, focal hepatic necroses, fluid retention presumably secondary to sodium retention, and alteration in the coagulation mechanism. At this point it becomes apparent that uterine vein blood is preferable to peripheral blood for analysis, because many substances implicated undergo rapid biologic change or are deposited at sites where lesions are seen. A recent study by Arias and Mancilla-Jimenez demonstrated that in liver biopsies of toxemic women the hepatic sinusoids were outlined by fibrin (or fibrinogen) and that these substances were present in areas of hepatic necrosis. To a lesser extent, IgG, IgM and C3 were also demonstrated by immunofluorescence in the necrotic foci. The investigators suggest that this is a factor common to both hepatic and renal injury - an attractive hypothesis. Considerable attention has been focused on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system as the humoral basis for hypertension in toxemic women. Human chorion contains four times the concentration of renin than that of amniotic fluid, which in turn has 40 times the concentration of renin than that of maternal plasma. But, until recently, methodologic problems made renin determinations chancy, and reported results were often contradictory. There is a significant difference between experimental models of pregnancy toxemia and the disease as it occurs in pregnant women. In experimental animals this disease is induced at a given instant of time, i.e. when the surgical occlusion of aorta or uterine arteries is completed. The only experiment to avoid this limitation is the one devised by Hodari, who placed his Teflon bands around the uterine arteries before his animals were bred, thereby allowing for a slower evolution of the entire process. The best treatment is to empty the uterus. The liver regenerates and the glomerular lesion is reversible. Some diseases succumb to a single brilliant coup, but others decline due to the inevitability of gradualism. Jenner's demonstration of smallpox vaccination, for example, was a remarkable flash of genius, and it sealed the doom of the smallpox virus, but it took over a century and a half, the work of countless physicians and their assistants, for medicine to be able to claim that it had eradicated the disease completely from the face of the earth. For toxemia of pregnancy it will take longer.

Issues explored include loss of patency, development of phlebitis, duration of lock placement, type of cannula material, sample size, risk of toxicity with heparin flush solutions, risk of clot embolism, and physical or chemical incompatibilities. Available studies indicate that heparin is not necessary to maintain fluoroethylenepropylene (FEP-Teflon) peripheral venous access devices unless the lock is used to obtain blood specimens. Considering the benefit-to-risk ratio for the use of heparin, it is advisable to maintain FEP-Teflon locks with normal saline alone. When locks are used to obtain blood specimens, as in a pharmacokinetic study, then a dilute heparin flush solution should be used. Whether heparin is necessary for the maintenance of locks composed of other materials is uncertain. Newer, less thrombogenic materials such as ethylene tetrafluoroethylene may also obviate the need for heparin, but comparative trials in a larger number of patients are needed for confirmation. When heparin is used, an effort should be made to avoid systemic toxicities by using the lowest known effective concentration (10 units/mL) pending further studies. © 1991, SAGE Publications.

The programmable Cas nuclease of this system used against bacterial genomic sequences could be lethal or could help reduce resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. Therefore, this study aims to review using the CRISPR-Cas system to promote sensitizing bacteria to antibiotics. We envision that CRISPR-Cas approaches may open novel ways for the development of smart antibiotics, which could eliminate multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens and differentiate between beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms.

This work presents a review on catalyst design and the most employed support materials in FTS to synthesize heavier hydrocarbons. Furthermore, in this report, the recent achievements on mechanisms of this reaction will be discussed. Catalyst deactivation is one of the most important challenges during FTS, which will be covered in this work. The selectivity of FTS can be tuned by operational conditions, nature of the catalyst, support, and reactor configuration. The effects of all these parameters will be analyzed within this report. More-over, zeolites can be employed as a support material of an FTS-based catalyst to direct synthesis of liquid fuels, and the specific character of zeolites will be elaborated further.

This review critically examines the strategies to generate highly reactive high-valent iron intermediates, FeVO43– (FeV) and FeIVO44– or FeIVO32– (FeIV) species, from FeVIO42–, for the treatment of polluted water with greater efficiency. Approaches to produce FeV and FeIV species from FeVIO42– include additions of acid (e.g., HCl), metal ions (e.g., Fe(III)), and reductants (R). Details on applying various inorganic reductants (R) to generate FeV and FeIV from FeVIO42– via initial single electron-transfer (SET) and oxygen-atom transfer (OAT) to oxidize recalcitrant pollutants are presented. The common constituents of urine (e.g., carbonate, ammonia, and creatinine) and different solids (e.g., silica and hydrochar) were found to accelerate the oxidation of pharmaceuticals by FeVIO42–, with potential mechanisms provided. The challenges of providing direct evidence of the formation of FeV/FeIV species are discussed. Kinetic modeling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide opportunities to distinguish between the two intermediates (i.e., FeIV and FeV) in order to enhance oxidation reactions utilizing FeVIO42–.

Notwithstanding their wide range of applications in consumer products and industrial processes, PFASs have been detected in the environment as well as in human body. Due to their potential adverse human health effects, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set the combined concentration of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water at 70 ng/L or 70 ppt (parts per trillion) as a lifetime health advisory level. Current standard detection methods for PFASs heavily rely on chromatographic techniques coupled with mass spectrometry. Although these methods provide accurate, specific, and sensitive measurements, their applications are greatly limited in advanced analytical laboratories because it necessitates expensive instrumentations, professional operators, complicated sample pretreatment, and considerable analysis time. Therefore, other detection methods beyond chromatographic based techniques, such as optical and electrochemical techniques, have also been extensively explored for simple, accessible, inexpensive, rapid, and sensitive detection of PFASs, particularly PFOA and PFOS. The purpose of this review is to provide recent progress in alternative detection platforms relying on non-MS based techniques for PFASs analysis. Starting with a brief introduction about the importance of monitoring PFASs, recent advances in various PFASs detection methods are grouped and discussed based on the difference of signals, with an emphasis on the working principles of different techniques, the sensing mechanism, and the sensing performance.

We analyzed the quality of the control groups managed with the standard treatment, noting data that may have altered these results, as well as analyzing the quality of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and treatment compliance. In light of this analysis, we believe that further trials should be carried out with fairly balanced prognostic factors to demonstrate beyond a doubt that concurrent chemoradiotherapy is superior to radiotherapy alone. In developing countries where resources are scarce, this type of tumor is found frequently. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy would involve increased costs and supportive care, taking away resources from other vital areas.

About 150 billion m3 of natural gas are flared annually, producing approximately 400 million tons of carbon dioxide alone among other greenhouse gases. A search into a viable method for natural gas conversion to methanol becomes imperative not only to save the soul of the ever-changing climate but also to bring an end to wastage of valuable resources by converting hitherto wasted natural gas to wealth. Currently the technologies of conversion of natural gas to methanol could be categorized into the conventional and the innovative technologies. The conventional technology is sub-divided into the indirect method also called the Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) method and the direct method. The major commercial technology currently in use for production of methanol from methane is the FTS method which involves basically two steps which are the steam reforming and the syngas hydrogenation steps. The FTS method is highly energy intensive and this is a factor responsible for its low energetic efficiency. The direct conversion of methane to methanol is a one-step partial oxidation and lower temperature method having higher energetic efficiency advantage over the FTS method. The direct method occurs at temperature range of 380–470 °C and pressure range of 1–5 MPa while the FTS occurs at temperature range of 700–1100 °C and atmospheric pressure. Both methods are carried out under effect of metallic oxide catalysts such as Mo, V, Cr, Bi, Cu, Zn, etc. The innovative methods which include electrochemical, solar and plasma irradiation methods can be described as an approach to either of the two conventional methods in an innovative way while the biological method is a natural process driven by methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzyme released by methanotrophic bacteria.

We experienced three left ventricular ruptures among these patients. Two had a type I immediate rupture, and one had a type III delayed rupture. Two patients (type I, III) survived after repair of the rupture. It was possible to control bleeding by manual compression with oxidized cellulose, collagen mat and fibrin glue with or without external mattress sutures. Following the repair, an intra-aortic balloon pump and sedative agents were used in both patients. In the other patient with a type I early rupture, control of bleeding was attempted by external direct suture using Teflon felt. The bleeding was controlled by this repair and the use of a left ventricular assist device, but the patient died of a brain infarction 5 days after the operation. The manual compression technique using oxidized cellulose, collagen mat and fibrin glue may be useful for minor lacerations, and for reinforcing repairs. The intra-aortic balloon pump and continuous sedation are useful for unloading the ventricle and reducing the tension on repairs.","aged; case report; female; heart rupture; heart valve prosthesis; heart valve replacement; heart ventricle; hemostasis; human; injury; male; methodology; middle aged; mitral valve; peroperative complication; postoperative complication; reoperation; review; time; Aged; Female; Heart Rupture; Heart Valve Prosthesis; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Heart Ventricles; Hemostasis, Surgical; Humans; Intraoperative Complications; Male; Middle Aged; Mitral Valve; Postoperative Complications; Reoperation; Time Factors"

Lopinavir is the main responsible for viral load suppression, whereas ritonavir is a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Both of them have recently gained relevance as candidate drugs against severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, significant beneficial effects were not observed in randomized clinical trials. This review summarizes the main physical-chemical, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacokinetic properties of ritonavir and lopinavir, along with the analytical methodologies applied for biological matrices, pharmaceutical formulations, and stability studies. The work also aimed to provide a comprehensive impurity profile for the combined formulation. Several analytical methods in four different pharmacopeias and 37 articles in literature were evaluated and summarized. Chromatographic methods for these drugs frequently use C8 or C18 stationary phases with acetonitrile and phosphate buffer (with ultraviolet detection) or acetate buffer (with tandem mass spectrometry detection) as the mobile phase. Official compendia methods show disadvantages as extended total run time and complex mobile phases. HPLC tandem-mass spectrometry provided high sensitivity in methodologies applied for human plasma and serum samples, supporting the therapeutic drug monitoring in HIV patients. Ritonavir and lopinavir major degradation products arise in alkaline and acidic environments, respectively. Other non-chromatographic methods were also summarized. Establishing the impurity profile for the combined formulation is challenging due to a large number of impurities reported.

As a typical perfluorinated compound widely distributed, PFOS contaminates many daily foods in various ways, such as food contamination through fast food packaging/wrappers, beverage contamination through disposable cardboard cups, food contamination through nonstick frying pan coating, in particular, the contamination through food contact materials is the most neglected pathway. PFOS has a variety of toxic effects including acute toxicity, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cytotoxicity and reproductive toxicity. However, the content of PFOS in the contaminated food contact materials is often relatively low. Thus, rapid and accurate determination of PFOS is challenging. In this paper, the toxicity of PFOS, contamination levels of PFOS in various media, migration of PFOS to foods, and various methods for detecting PFOS in food contact materials were reviewed.

This article systematically and critically reviews the epidemiologic evidence regarding the association between PFOA and PFOS exposure and cancer risk in humans. Eighteen epidemiologic studies-eight of PFOA, four of PFOS, and six of both PFOA and PFOS-have estimated associations of exposure to these chemicals with cancer incidence or mortality, with studies equally divided between occupational and nonoccupational settings. Although some statistically significant positive associations have been reported, for example, with cancers of the prostate, kidney, testis, and thyroid, the majority of relative risk estimates for both PFOA and PFOS have been between 0.5 and 2.0 (with 95% confidence intervals including 1.0), inconsistently detected across studies, counterbalanced by negative associations, not indicative of a monotonic exposure-response relationship, and not coherent with toxicological evidence in animals, in which the primary target organs are the liver, testis (Leydig cells), and pancreas (acinar cells). Many positive associations with PFOA exposure were detected in community settings without occupational exposure and were not supported by results in exposed workers. Given that occupational exposure to PFOA and PFOS is one to two orders of magnitude higher than environmental exposure, the discrepant positive findings are likely due to chance, confounding, and/or bias. Taken together, the epidemiologic evidence does not support the hypothesis of a causal association between PFOA or PFOS exposure and cancer in humans. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; cancer epidemiology; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer risk; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; disease association; environmental exposure; Europe; experimental rat; health care facility; human; kidney cancer; liver cancer; neoplasm; nonhuman; occupational exposure; pancreas cancer; population exposure; prostate cancer; review; systematic review; testis cancer; thyroid cancer; United States; worker; adverse effects; animal; Neoplasms; pathology; risk; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Caprylates; Environmental Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Neoplasms; Occupational Exposure; Risk

Mechanisms of formation of these unique tandem lesions were elucidated. The 8,5′-cyclization causes an unusual puckering of the sugar moiety giving rise to significant distortion in the DNA double helix. Methodologies were developed for the measurement of these lesions in DNA by mass spectrometry coupled either with gas chromatography or high performance liquid chromatography. Both techniques allowed identification and quantification of both R- and S-diastereomers of cdA and cdG in DNA in vitro and in vivo. Because of the 8,5′-covalent bond between the sugar and base moieties in the same nucleoside, cdA and cdG are repaired by nucleotide excision repair rather than by base excision repair. Thus, these lesions may play a role in diseases with defective nucleotide excision repair. Their biological effects include blocking DNA polymerases, inhibition of gene expression, transcriptional mutagenesis among others. Accumulation of cdA and cdG was observed in tissues in vivo in connection to disease and environmental conditions, suggesting an important role for these lesions in disease processes including carcinogenesis and neuronal death. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.","5',8 cyclodeoxyguanosine; 8,5' cyclo 2' deoxyadenosine; deoxyadenosine; deoxyadenosine derivative; deoxyguanosine; deoxyguanosine derivative; DNA polymerase; hydroxyl radical; 5',8 cyclodeoxyguanosine; 8,5' cyclo 2' deoxyadenosine; 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyadenosine; 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyguanosine; deoxyguanosine; DNA; drug derivative; unclassified drug; breast cancer; cell regeneration; chemical structure; Cockayne syndrome; covalent bond; cyclization; diastereoisomer; DNA determination; DNA helix; DNA repair; DNA structure; excision repair; familial Mediterranean fever; gas chromatography; gene expression; gene mutation; high performance liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; priority journal; review; stereospecificity; structure analysis; xeroderma pigmentosum; animal; chemistry; conformation; DNA repair; gene expression regulation; human; liquid chromatography; mass fragmentography; mouse; Animals; Chromatography, Liquid; Deoxyadenosines; Deoxyguanosine; DNA; DNA Repair; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Hydroxyl Radical; Mass Spectrometry; Mice; Nucleic Acid Conformation"

Furthermore, the emphasis has shifted from blood replacement fluid to ""O2 therapeutics"" that restore tissue oxygenation to specific tissues regions. This review covers the different alternatives, potential and limitations of hemoglobin-based O2 carriers (HBOCs) and perfluorocarbon-based O2 carriers (PFCOCs), with emphasis on the physiologic conditions disturbed in the situation that they will be used. It describes how concepts learned from plasma expanders without O2-carrying capacity can be applied to maintain O2 delivery and summarizes the microvascular responses due to HBOCs and PFCOCs. This review also presents alternative applications of HBOCs and PFCOCs namely: 1) How HBOC O2 affinity can be engineered to target O2 delivery to hypoxic tissues; and 2) How the high gas solubility of PFCOCs provides new opportunities for carrying, dissolving, and delivering gases with biological activity. It is concluded that the development of current blood substitutes has amplified their applications horizon by devising therapeutic functions for O2 carriers requiring limited O2 delivery capacity restoration. Conversely, full, blood-like O2-carrying capacity reestablishment awaits the control of O2 carrier toxicity.

These characteristics are useful for the industrial production, however they are also potentially dangerous for human health and for the environment. PFAS are persistent pollutants accumulating in waters and soil and recoverable in foods due to their release by food packaging. Humans are daily exposed to PFAS because these compounds are ubiquitous and, when assimilated, they are difficult to be eliminated, persisting for years both in humans and animals. Due to their persistence and potential danger to health, some old generation PFAS have been replaced by newly synthesized PFAS with the aim to use alternative compounds presumably safer for humans and the environment. Yet, the environmental pollution with PFAS remains a matter of concern worldwide and led to large-scale epidemiological studies both on plants’ workers and on exposed people in the general population. In this context, strong concern emerged concerning the potential adverse effects of PFAS on the thyroid gland. Thyroid hormones play a critical role in the regulation of metabolism, and thyroid function is related to cardiovascular disease, fertility, and fetal neurodevelopment. In vitro, ex vivo data, and epidemiological studies suggested that PFASs may disrupt the thyroid hormone system in humans, with possible negative repercussions on the outcome of pregnancy and fetal-child development. However, data on the thyroid disrupting effect of PFAS remain controversial, as well as their impact on human health in different ages of life. Aim of the present paper is to review recent data on the effects of old and new generation PFAS on thyroid homeostasis. To this purpose we collected information from in vitro studies, animal models, and in vivo data on exposed workers, general population, and pregnant women. © Copyright © 2021 Coperchini, Croce, Ricci, Magri, Rotondi, Imbriani and Chiovato.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; endocrine disruptor; iodine; leptin receptor; liothyronine; perflubutane; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; somatomedin C; surfactant; testosterone; thyroid antibody; thyroid hormone; thyroid hormone receptor; thyroid peroxidase antibody; thyrotropin; thyroxine; unclassified drug; water; alkylation; autoimmune thyroiditis; cardiovascular disease; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cytotoxicity; environmental exposure; ex vivo study; female; fertility; fetus; fluorination; food packaging; free thyroxine index; homeostasis; homeostasis model assessment; human; hyperthyroidism; hypothyroidism; in vivo study; industrial production; nerve cell differentiation; nervous system development; neural tube defect; nonhuman; pollutant; pollution; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prenatal exposure; protein synthesis; Review; signal transduction; spermatogenesis; subclinical hypothyroidism; thyroid disease; thyroid function; thyrotropin blood level; thyroxine blood level; upregulation; worker"

This paper reviews the currently applied techniques for sample pre-treatment, extraction and clean-up for the analysis of ionic and non-ionic PFASs in human and environmental matrices. Solid phase extraction (SPE) is the method of choice for liquid samples (e.g. water, blood, serum, plasma), and may be automated in an on-line set-up for (large volume) sample enrichment and sample clean-up. Prior to SPE, sample pre-treatment (filtration or centrifugation for water or protein precipitation for blood) may be required. Liquid-liquid extraction can also be used for liquid samples (and does not require above mentioned sample pretreatment). Solid-liquid extraction is the commonly applied method for solid matrices (biota, sludge, soil, sediment), but automation options are limited due to contamination from polytetrafluorethylene tubings and parts applied in extraction equipment. Air is generally preconcentrated on XAD-resins sandwiched between polyurethane foam plugs. Clean-up of crude extracts is essential for destruction and removal of lipids and other co-extractives that may interfere in the instrumental determination. SPE, (fluorous) silica column chromatography, dispersive graphitized carbon and destructive methods such as sulphuric acid or KOH treatment can be applied for clean-up of extracts. Care should be taken to avoid contamination (e.g. from sample bottles, filters, equipment) and losses of PFASs (e.g. adsorption, volatilization) during sampling, extraction and clean-up. Storage at -20 °C is generally appropriate for conservation of samples. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The presence of two opposing segments within one molecule makes semifluorinated alkanes a very interesting class of compounds, which show a particular behavior both in bulk and at interfaces. Their highly asymmetric structure, arising from the incompatibility of the both constituent parts, results in surface activity of these molecules (so-called primitive surfactants) when dissolved in organic solvents, and allows for the Langmuir monolayer formation if spread at the air/water interface, despite of the absence of any polar group. Since 1984 (when SFAs have been characterized for the first time by Rabolt et al. [Rabolt JF, Russell TP, Twieg RJ.

These include establishing the pathological nature of bleeding, and the uncertainties surrounding the clinical relevance of laboratory results. Furthermore, the high frequency of bleeding symptoms in the normal population and the subjective appraisal of symptoms by patients or parents makes elucidating the pathological nature of bleeding difficult. Standardized bleeding assessment tools and semiquantitative bleeding scores (BSs) help to discriminate normal from abnormal bleeding. However, as most MBDs have similar bleeding patterns, for example, bleeding sites, frequency, and severity, BSs are of little help for diagnosing specific diseases. Global tests of primary hemostasis (bleeding time; PFA-100/200) lack sensitivity and, like BSs, are not disease-specific. Problems with the diagnosis of type 1 VWD and PFD include assay standardization, uncertain definition of von Willebrand factor cut-off levels, and the lack of universal diagnostic criteria for PFD. Regarding clotting factor deficiencies, the bleeding thresholds of some coagulation factors, such as factor VII and FXI, are highly variable, and may lead to misinterpretation of the clinical relevance of mild to moderate deficiencies.

Therefore, there is growing concern about how to act to stop the increase in environmental pollution. Some of these compounds that began to accumulate in the environment since the last century are well known by the scientific community and are widely called persistent pollutants. This group includes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and heavy metals, among others. However, other compounds that have not been considered as contaminants have appeared recently. These are the so-called emerging pollutants, which involve a long list of compounds including drugs, hormones, antimicrobials, plasticizers, UV filters, etc. Through the study of different organisms, the presence of these pollutants in natural environments as well as the harmful effects they cause to the biota present in said media are being deeply investigated. Two of the aquatic model organisms used as bioindicators in the different studies for this purpose are reviewed here: the sea cucumber of the genus Holothuria and the common sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus that share the fact of being, both, edible echinoderms. This review could be used to make people aware of the damage it is causing through the irresponsible management of natural resources, so that they serve to launch a series of measures that allow recovering the original conditions of the different ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Aquatic organisms; Ecosystems; Heavy metals; Mammals; Natural resources management; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Solvents; Echinoderm; Environmental pollutions; Holothuria spp; Marine pollutants; Paracentrotus lividus; Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Terrestrial ecosystems; Marine pollution; bioindicator; chemical pollutant; echinoderm; edible species; heavy metal; human activity; marine ecosystem; marine pollution; PAH; PCB; terrestrial ecosystem; Echinodermata; Holothuria; Holothuroidea; Paracentrotus lividus

It plays a crucial scaffolding role to support spermatogenesis. On the other hand, laminin-333 comprised of laminin-α3/ß3/γ3 at the apical ES (ectoplasmic specialization, a testis-specific cell-cell adherens junction at the Sertoli cell-step 8–19 spermatid interface) expressed by spermatids serves as a unique cell adhesion protein that forms an adhesion complex with α6ß1-integrin expressed by Sertoli cells to support spermiogenesis. Emerging evidence has shown that biologically active fragments are derived from basement membrane and apical ES laminin chains through proteolytic cleavage mediated by matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and MMP2, respectively. Two of these laminin bioactive fragments: one from the basement membrane laminin-α2 chain called LG3/4/5-peptide, and one from the apical ES laminin-γ3 chain known as F5-peptide, are potent regulators that modify cell adhesion function at the Sertoli-spermatid interface (i.e., apical ES) but also at the Sertoli cell-cell interface designated basal ES at the blood-testis barrier (BTB) with contrasting effects. These findings not only highlight the physiological significance of these bioactive peptides that create a local regulatory network to support spermatogenesis, they also open a unique area of research. For instance, it is likely that several other bioactive peptides remain to be identified. These bioactive peptides including their downstream signaling proteins and cascades should be studied collectively in future investigations to elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) by which they coordinate with each other to maintain spermatogenesis.

The carbon-fluorine bond of PFAS provides desirable hydrophobic and oleophobic properties and stability that has led to widespread usage in consumer products and industrial applications. The strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also prevents appreciable degradation once released into the environment. Consequently, various household products can release volatile and nonvolatile PFAS into the indoor environment that often concentrate in dust. We discuss the diversity of PFAS in settled dust, emission sources of these chemicals, changes in PFAS profiles in dust over the past century, and the implications for human health. Recent Findings: Sources of PFAS found in dust include building materials and furnishings and consumer products used in typical indoor spaces. Daycares and workplaces are emphasized as locations with widespread exposure due to the presence of treated carpeting and industrial-strength cleaners. Comparison and interpretation of findings across studies are complicated by the different ways in which PFAS are screened across studies. We further discuss recent developments in non-targeted software for the comprehensive annotation of PFAS in indoor dust and emphasize the need for comprehensive and harmonized analytical workflows. Summary: We highlight the detection and diversity of PFAS in settled dust collected from various indoor spaces, including locations with vulnerable subpopulations. There are opportunities for future research to leverage settled dust as a sentinel environmental matrix to evaluate the link between inhalation and ingestion routes of PFAS exposure to adverse health. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","fluorocarbon; dust; human; indoor air pollution; prevalence; Air Pollution, Indoor; Dust; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Prevalence"

In particular, we focus on fluorine-free sulfonated aromatic polymers as alternatives to the benchmark perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer (e.g., Nafion) PEMs. Most fluorine-free sulfonated aromatic polymers require improved proton conductivity (at high temperatures and low humidity) and chemical and mechanical stability. To address these issues, a wide range of molecular structures and their sequences were investigated. First, the effect of molecular structure on the membrane properties of sulfonated multiblock copoly(arylene ether)s is discussed. We emphasize that phosphine oxide moieties might improve chemical stability; however, aromatic ether linkages in the hydrophilic block are not suitable because oxidative degradation and excess water swelling followed by mechanical failure is essentially inevitable. We then developed a novel polymer synthetic method, an intrapolymer Heck reaction, to ladderize aromatic ether linkages in the hydrophilic block. The ladderized rigid hydrophilic structure is an effective molecular design for balancing proton conductivity and mechanical stability. We then discuss two types of segmented copolymers based on the rigid hydrophilic structural design via a Ni-mediated coupling reaction; the hydrophilic structures are sulfonated phenylene and sulfonated benzophenone. We found that the traditional multiblock structure as well as any additional polar groups (e.g., ether, sulfone, ketone) in the hydrophilic sections are not necessary for improving the membrane properties that are important for fuel cell applications, such as proton conductivity and chemical and mechanical stability. The results indicate that fluorine-free aromatic PEMs are a potentially applicable class of ionomers for the next generation of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. © 2017 The Society of Polymer Science, Japan (SPSJ) All rights reserved.",Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Chemical bonds; Chemical reactions; Chemical stability; Degradation; Ethers; Failure (mechanical); Fluorine; Fuel cells; Hydrophilicity; Ionomers; Ketones; Mechanical stability; Membranes; Molecular structure; Phosphorus compounds; Proton conductivity; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Rigid structures; Stability; Structural design; Fuel cell application; Membrane properties; Multi-block structures; Oxidative degradation; Perfluorosulfonic acid ionomers; Proton exchange membranes; Segmented copolymer; Sulfonated aromatic polymers; Aromatic polymers

Hypogonadism can be caused by testicular disease (primary hypogonadism) or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (secondary hypogonadism). The present strategy for treating hypogonadism is the administration of exogenous testosterone. But exogenous testosterone is reported to have negative side effects including adverse cardiovascular events and disruption of physiological spermatogenesis probably due to its inability to mimic the physiological circadian rhythm of testosterone secretion in vivo. In recent years, a growing number of articles demonstrated that stem Leydig cells (SLCs) can not only differentiate into functional Leydig cells (LCs) in vivo to replace chemically disrupted LCs, but also secrete testosterone in a physiological pattern. The proliferation and differentiation of SLCs are regulated by various factors. However, the mechanisms involved in regulating the development of SLCs remain to be summarized. Factors involved in the regulation of SLCs can be divided into environmental pollutants, growth factors, cytokine and hormones. Environmental pollutants such as Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and Triphenyltin (TPT) could suppress SLCs proliferation or differentiation. Growth factors including FGF1, FGF16, NGF and activin A are essential for the maintenance of SLCs self-renewal and differentiation. Interleukin 6 family could inhibit differentiation of SLCs. Among hormones, dexamethasone suppresses SLCs differentiation, while aldosterone suppresses their proliferation. The present review focuses on new progress about factors regulating SLC’s proliferation and differentiation which will undoubtedly deepen our insights into SLCs and help make better clinical use of them.

PFAS compounds are resistant to degradation and are mobile in soil compared to other common contaminants. Many compounds have KD values (matrix/solution concentration quotients) of &lt;10. PFAS compounds endanger the health of humans and ecosystems by leaching into groundwater, exposure via dust, and, to a lesser extent, through plant uptake. This review aims to determine the feasibility of phytomanagement, the use of plants, and the use of soil conditioners to minimize environmental risk whilst also providing an economic return in the management of PFAS-contaminated land. For most sites, PFAS combina-tions render phytoextraction, the use of plants to remove PFAS from soil, inviable. In contrast, low Bioaccumulation Coefficients (BAC; plant and soil concentration quotients) timber species or native vegetation may be usefully employed for phytomanagement to limit human/food chain exposure to PFAS. Even with a low BAC, PFAS uptake by crop plants may still exceed food safety standards, and therefore, edible crop plants should be avoided. Despite this limitation, phytomanagement may be the only economically viable option to manage most of this land. Plant species and soil amendments should be chosen with the goal of reducing water flux through the soil, as well as increasing the hydrophobic components in soil that may bind the C-F-dominated tails of PFAS compounds. Soil conditioners such as biochar, with significant hydrophobic components, may mitigate the leaching of PFAS into receiving waters. Future work should focus on the interactions of PFAS with soil microbiota; secondary metabolites such as glomalin may immobilize PFAS in soil. © 2022 by the authors.

In particular, the review will focus on how these techniques have been successfully used to describe the salient characteristics of these catalysts that govern subsequent activity and selectivity, as well as to afford insight into deactivation phenomena that have seemingly stifled their application. We discuss how these X-ray-based techniques have been used to yield insight into the bulk structure, the catalyst surface, oxidation states, local (cobalt) geometry, and elemental composition of particles, primarily from a 1D perspective but we also highlight how, with recent developments in advanced X-ray characterisation methods, crucial information can now be obtained in 2D and 3D. The examples chosen focus on data acquired in situ/operando, under realistic operating conditions and during activation which often allow for obtaining a more relevant perspective on the changes in catalyst structure that accompany a change in catalyst performance. We conclude with a perspective on some of the challenges that beset the Co-based FTS technology and discuss how X-ray based techniques could be used to solve them. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Catalysts; Cobalt; Distribution functions; X ray absorption spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray spectroscopy; Catalyst performance; Catalyst structures; Deactivation phenomena; Elemental compositions; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalysts; Fisher-Tropsch synthesis; Operating condition; Pair distribution functions; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis

Comparatively little is known about individual stereoisomers of pollutants, which can have differential toxicological effects and can be tracers of biochemical weathering in the environment. Stereoisomers are resolved by gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE). Separation techniques in environmental analysis are typically coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), as these provide the sensitivity and selectivity needed. The enantiomer composition of phenoxyalkanoic and acetamide herbicides, organophosphorus and pyrethroid pesticides, chiral polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites, synthetic musks, hexabromocyclododecane, and pharmaceuticals in the environment show species-dependent enantioselectivity from biotransformation and other biologically mediated processes affecting enantiomers differentially. These enantiomer compositions are useful in detecting biologically mediated environmental reactions, apportioning sources of pollutants, and gaining insight into the biochemical fate of chiral pollutants in the environment, which are needed for accurate risk assessment of such chemicals. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Biotransformation; Chiral pollutants; Environmental chemistry; Organic pollutants; Separation techniques; Source apportionment; Stereoisomers; Biochemistry; Isomers; Mass spectrometry; Organic compounds; Risk assessment; Stereochemistry; Impurities; organic compound; pesticide; bioremediation; chemical structure; pollutant; review; stereoisomerism; Biodegradation, Environmental; Environmental Pollutants; Molecular Structure; Organic Chemicals; Pesticides; Stereoisomerism"

In utero exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), a major psychoactive component of marijuana, is associated with an increased risk for anencephaly and neurobehavioural deficiencies in the offspring, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disabilities, and memory impairment. Recent studies demonstrate that the developing central nervous system (CNS) is susceptible to the effects of Δ9-THC and other cannabimimetics, including the psychoactive ingredients of the branded product 'Spice' branded products. These exocannabinoids interfere with the function of an endocannabinoid (eCB) system, present in the developing CNS from E12.5 (week 5 of gestation in humans), and required for proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neurons. Until recently, it was not known whether the eCB system is also present in the developing CNS during the initial stages of its ontogeny, i.e. from E7.0 onwards (week 2 of gestation in humans), and if so, whether this system is also susceptible to the action of exocannabinoids. Here, we review current data, in which the presence of an eCB system during the initial stage of development of the CNS is demonstrated. Furthermore, we focus on recent advances on the effect of canabimimetics on early gestation. The relevance of these findings and potential adverse developmental consequences of in utero exposure to 'high potency' marijuana, Spice branded products and/or cannabinoid research chemicals during this period is discussed. Finally, we address the implication of these findings in terms of the potential dangers of synthetic cannabinoid use during pregnancy, and the ongoing debate over legalization of marijuana. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","2,3 dihydro 5 methyl 3 (morpholinomethyl) 6 (1 naphthoyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3 de][1,4]benzoxazine; 3 (1 naphthoyl) 1 pentylindole; 4 (1,1 dimethylheptyl) 1',2',3',4',5',6' hexahydro 2,3' dihydroxy 6' (3 hydroxypropyl)biphenyl; am 2201; am 694; cannabinoid 1 receptor; cannabis; cp 47497 c8; dexanabinol; dronabinol; endocannabinoid; excipient; exocannabinoid derivative; illicit drug; jwh 073; jwh 210; jwh 398; jwn 250; jzl 184; nabilone; nabiximols; nam; oxiran acetate; oxiran hexanoate; psychotropic agent; rcs 08; rcs 4; rcs 4 c4; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; urb 602; urb 602 carbamate; wwl 70; anencephalus; antidepressant activity; behavior disorder; brain development; brain region; cell migration; cell proliferation; drug potency; human; mental disease; nerve cell differentiation; nerve degeneration; neuroprotection; neurotransmission; nonhuman; ontogeny; pregnant woman; prenatal exposure; prevalence; priority journal; review; spice; synthesis; tranquilizing activity; Anencephaly; Animals; Cannabinoids; Central Nervous System; Drug and Narcotic Control; Female; Humans; Marijuana Abuse; Maternal Exposure; Mental Disorders; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Tetrahydrocannabinol"

Conceptually, polydentate Lewis acids are often regarded as the charge reverse analogs of polydentate Lewis bases and are thus expected to act as polydentate ligands for electron-rich substrates.4 This analogy was recognized almost four decades ago by Shriver and Biallas who showed that methoxide anions are effectively chelated by 1,2-bis(difluoroboryl)ethane (1), a charge reverse analog of ethylenediamine (Scheme 1).5 Following this seminal contribution, a great deal of effort has been devoted to the synthesis and study of such polydentate Lewis acids. An important part of the compounds that have been investigated consists of polyfunctional organostannanes1 and organomercurials.6-11 Despite the soft Lewis acidity of tin and mercury, these compounds exhibit remarkable properties and have been used as receptors for anions as well as for small electron-rich molecules. For example, while the 1,2-distannylbenzene 212 or the mercuraborand 313 readily complex chloride anions, trinuclear mercury derivatives such as trimeric perfluoro-ortho-phenylene 4 can be used as receptors for organic substrates including acetone (Scheme 2).14 Aiming at more powerful Lewis acids, a great deal of effort has been devoted to the preparation of polydentate Lewis acids that contain hard Lewis acidic elements of group 13.15,16 Despite their greater sensitivity toward hydrolysis and oxidation, several polydentate group 13 derivatives have been successfully synthesized and investigated. An important aspect of this research resides in the choice of the backbone that serves to hold the Lewis acidic site. In order to insure that the Lewis acidic sites remain available, it is important to choose a backbone that does not contain accessible Lewis basic sites such as oxygen or nitrogen atoms which could neutralize the Lewis acidic centers by intramolecular Lewis adduct formation or by through-bond π-electron donation. Moreover, as in the chemistry of polydentate Lewis bases, the structure of the backbone should serve to dictate the spatial orientation of the Lewis acidic centers as well as the overall rigidity or flexibility of the target polydentate Lewis acid. Since the occurrence of cooperative effects is entropically impaired with flexible systems, the preorganization of the Lewis acidic sites in a rigid molecular edifice is often preferred. Recent achievements in this area have centered on derivatives of ortho-substituted benzenes and peri-substituted naphthalenes. In this chapter, we will review the chemistry of bidentate Lewis acids containing two group 13 elements linked by an ortho-phenylene15,16 or a peri-naphthalenediyl backbone. This contribution follows an earlier review concerned with peri-naphthalenediyl group 13 derivatives.17. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",NA

The term ""emerging pollutants"" stands for the substances that are released in the environment for which currently no regulations are established for their environmental monitoring. Their occurrence is reported worldwide in a range of aquatic environments, such as lakes, rivers, freshwater catchments, estuaries, reservoirs and marine waters. Nevertheless, due to their large number (ranging in an order of thousands), only few of these compounds are toxicologically evaluated. Published data concerning occurrence and potential toxicological effects is limited. The contamination source of the aquatic environment is mainly the effluents from the sewage treatment plants (STPs). Reliable methods are available for residue analysis of these pollutants down to low ng L-1 levels. However, an urgent need is highlighted for the investigation (primarily in environmental media and following in biological ones) of the toxicity and transformation pathways of all emerging pollutants. The aims of this mini-review are to briefly present: (a) the major classes of emerging pollutants; (b) the reasons why these substances constitute an environmental issue; and (c) developments and applications of environmental analysis in this field. © 2012 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

In this paper, we argue that the higher the persistence of a chemical, the greater the emphasis that it should be given in chemicals assessment and decision making. We provide case studies for three classes of highly persistent chemicals (chlorofluorocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) to exemplify problems unique to highly persistent chemicals, despite their otherwise diverse properties. Many well-known historical chemical pollution problems were the result of the release of highly persistent chemicals. Using evaluative modeling calculations, we demonstrate that if a chemical is highly persistent, its continuous release will lead to continuously increasing contamination irrespective of the chemical's physical-chemical properties. We argue that these increasing concentrations will result in increasing probabilities of the occurrence of known and unknown effects and that, once adverse effects are identified, it will take decades, centuries or even longer to reverse contamination and therefore effects. Based on our findings we propose that high persistence alone should be established as a sufficient basis for regulation of a chemical, which we term the ""P-sufficient approach"". We argue that regulation on high persistence alone is not over-precautionary given the historical and ongoing problems that persistent chemicals have caused. Regulation of highly persistent chemicals, for example by restriction of emissions, would not only be precautionary, but would serve to prevent poorly reversible future impacts. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Decision making; Indicators (chemical); Chemical pollution; Chemical regulation; Diverse properties; Environmental science; Model calculations; Persistent chemicals; Physical chemical property; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Chemical hazards; environmental chemical; chlorofluorocarbon; polychlorinated biphenyl; calculation; contamination; decision making; mass; pollution; priority journal; probability; regulatory mechanism; Review; analysis; dangerous goods; ecosystem restoration; human; pollution; theoretical model; Chlorofluorocarbons; Environmental Pollution; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Hazardous Substances; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Polychlorinated Biphenyls"

Often, their biodegradability by activated sludge microorganisms is decisive for their elimination during wastewater treatment. Since the amounts of micropollutants seem too low to serve as growth substrate, cometabolism is supposed to be the dominating biodegradation process. Nevertheless, as many biodegradation studies were performed without the intention to discriminate between metabolic and cometabolic processes, the specific contribution of the latter to substance transformations is often not clarified. This minireview summarizes current knowledge about the cometabolic degradation of organic trace pollutants by activated sludge and sludge-inherent microorganisms. Due to their relevance for communal wastewater contamination, the focus is laid on pharmaceuticals, personal care products, antibiotics, estrogens, and nonylphenols. Wherever possible, reference is made to the molecular process level, i.e., cometabolic pathways, involved enzymes, and formed transformation products.

Most of these compounds have been detected in significant amounts in different water matrices (drinking, sewage, ground water). Several conventional and advanced oxidation processes have been used for the removal of ECs. However, these processes are limited by incomplete degradation and high energy input, and some technologies such as adsorption and membrane processes involve only phase transfer of pollutants. According to the USEPA, ECs in the range from ng L−1 to mg L−1 can impose adverse environmental and health effects. This review details the application of nonthermal plasma (NTP) produced by pulsed electrical discharge which has been widely investigated for the abatement of various emerging contaminants in water and wastewater. Since NTP may not be economically suitable as a stand-alone unit for wastewater because of energy costs and the formation of reaction byproducts this review will focus on the integration of NTP in water treatment schemes. In general, single unit water treatment techniques are inadequate for the removal of these recalcitrant compounds. Treatment technologies that combine various advanced oxidation/reduction processes such as NTP with other conventional methods such as biological treatment may have potential for the complete removal of such pollutants. Pre-treatment and post-treatment NTP units can be added based on economic viability and treatment effectiveness. Integrated technologies for removal of ECs from water are critically examined in this review. © 2022, Institute of Electrostatics. All rights reserved.",NA

The Protocol is also helping to reduce global warming: CFCs are shown to be currently the largest fluorocarbon contributors to climate change. Relative contributions to climate change from CFCs and their HFC substitutes are discussed, together with the consequences of control of minor greenhouse gases on an environmental impact which is dominated by carbon dioxide emissions. Both the potencies of the materials for environmental change and their concentrations in the atmosphere are important and are considered here.Trifluoroacetic acid, a minor product of atmospheric decomposition of some HCFCs and HFCs and of the pyrolysis of fluoropolymers, has been shown to be uniformly distributed in seawater to a depth of over 4000 m and so is natural, although the actual source has yet to be identified.The Montreal Protocol is only one example of action to reduce undesirable impact from fluorocarbons. Other, less universal, actions include abatement of fluoroform greenhouse gas emissions from HCFC manufacturing, process changes to eliminate trifluoromethylsulfur pentafluoride emissions from electrochemical fluorination and ceasing manufacture of perfluorooctanyl sulfonate compounds due to their persistence in human tissue. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the first demonstration of enhanced O2 solubility, inhaled PFC could sustain rat metabolism. Intravenous emulsions were then trialed as ""blood substitutes."" In the last 10 yr, biocomputational modeling has enhanced our mechanistic understanding of PFCs. Contemporary research is now taking advantage of these physiological discoveries and applying PFCs as ""oxygen therapeutics,"" as well as ways to enhance other gas movements. One particularly promising area of research is the treatment of gas embolism (arterial and venous emboli/decompression sickness). An expansive understanding of PFC-enhanced diffusive gas movements through tissue and vasculature may have analogous applications for O2 or other respiratory gases and should provide a revolution in medicine.

Here we review PFAS occurrence, behavior, and toxicity in various water sources, and critically discuss their removal via mineral adsorbents, including natural aluminosilicate clay minerals, oxidic clays (Al, Fe, and Si oxides), organoclay minerals, and clay-polymer and clay‑carbon (biochar and graphene oxide) composite materials. Among the many remediation technologies, such as reverse osmosis, adsorption, advanced oxidation and biologically active processes, adsorption is the most suitable for PFAS removal in aquatic systems. Treatment strategies using clay minerals and oxidic clays are inexpensive, eco-friendly, and efficient for bulk PFAS removal due to their high surface areas, porosity, and high loading capacity. A comparison of partition coefficient values calculated from extracted data in published literature indicate that organically-modified clay minerals are the best-performing adsorbent for PFAS removal. In this review, we scrutinize the corresponding plausible mechanisms, factors, and challenges affecting the PFAS removal processes, demonstrating that modified clay minerals (e.g., surfactant, amine), including some commercially available products (e.g., FLUORO-SORB®, RemBind®, matCARE™), show good efficacy in PFAS remediation in contaminated media under field conditions. Finally, we propose future research to focus on the challenges of using clay-based adsorbents for PFAS removal from contaminated water due to the regeneration and safe-disposal of spent clay adsorbents is still a major issue, whilst enhancing the PFAS removal efficiency should be an ongoing scientific effort. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Adsorption; Aluminum compounds; Graphene oxide; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Potable water; Remediation; Toxicity; Biochar; Clay and clay mineral; Clay-biochar composite; Clean water and sanitation; Clean waters; Green and sustainable remediation; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substance; State of the art; Water state; Clay minerals

The global historical industry-wide emissions of total PFCAs from direct (manufacture, use, consumer products) and indirect (PFCA impurities and/or precursors) sources were estimated to be 3200-7300 tonnes. It was estimated that the majority (∼80%) of PFCAs have been released to the environment from fluoropolymer manufacture and use. Although indirect sources were estimated to be much less important than direct sources, there were larger uncertainties associated with the calculations for indirect sources. The physical-chemical properties of PFO (negligible vapor pressure, high solubility in water, and moderate sorption to solids) suggested that PFO would accumulate in surface waters. Estimated mass inventories of PFO in various environmental compartments confirmed that surface waters, especially oceans, contain the majority of PFO. The only environmental sinks for PFO were identified to be sediment burial and transport to the deep oceans, implying a long environmental residence time. Transport pathways for PFCAs in the environment were reviewed, and it was concluded that, in addition to atmospheric transport/degradation of precursors, atmospheric and ocean water transport of the PFCAs themselves could significantly contribute to their long-range transport. It was estimated that 2-12 tonnes/ year of PFO are transported to the Artic by oceanic transport, which is greater than the amount estimated to result from atmospheric transport/degradation of precursors. © 2006 American Chemical Society.","Environmental engineering; Fluorine compounds; Industrial emissions; Oceanography; Solubility; Surface waters; Vapor pressure; Fluoropolymer; Oceanic transport; Transport pathways; Carboxylation; carboxylic acid derivative; fluorocarbon; perfluorocarboxylic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; sea water; surface water; unclassified drug; chemical pollutant; environmental fate; industrial emission; pollutant source; pollutant transport; adsorption; chemical industry; consumer; degradation; environmental impact; environmental residence time; field emission; geographic distribution; mean residence time; ocean environment; physical chemistry; pollution transport; precursor; review; sediment; solubility; source sink relationship; vapor pressure; water transport; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biological Transport; Carboxylic Acids; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Supply"

However, advanced separation processes, like extractive distillation, are required to selectively separate azeotropic and close-boiling refrigerant mixtures. In this regard, ionic liquids (ILs) arise as promising entrainers because of their favorable properties, including nonvolatility and good HFC solubility selectivity. The aim of this review is to become a reference text for the research and design of novel separation processes for mixtures of fluorinated gases based on the use of ILs. We include an extensive compilation of publications on equilibrium, mass transport, and absorption and membrane separation related to the use of ILs to selectively separate, not only the most relevant refrigerants employed nowadays, namely, HFCs, hydrofluoroolefins, and hydrochlorofluoroolefins, but also other relevant refrigerant families, such as chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons. The UC-RAIL database provided as Supplementary Information compiles more than 5000 data points that are comprehensively analyzed in the review focusing on process design. Finally, we provide a set of directions that lead to the recovery of fluorinated refrigerant gases, to shift the refrigeration and air conditioning sector towards a more circular economy. © 2021 The Author(s)",Air conditioning; Design; Diffusion; Distillation; Fluorocarbons; Gas permeable membranes; Gases; Global warming; Ionic liquids; Mixtures; Process design; Solubility; Close-boiling; Extractive distillation; Global warming potential; Hydrofluorocarbons; Hydrofluoroolefin; Liquid equilibrium; Membrane separation; Refrigerant gas; Refrigerants mixtures; Separation process; Refrigerants

These processes are orchestrated by intracellular, endocrine, and paracrine signaling processes. Because of this complexity, testis development can be disrupted by a variety of environmental toxicants. The toxicity of phthalic acid esters (phthalates) on the fetal testis has been the subject of extensive research for two decades, and phthalates have become an archetypal fetal testis toxicant. Phthalates disrupt the seminiferous cord formation and maturation, Sertoli cell function, biosynthesis of testosterone in Leydig cells, and impair germ cell survival and development, producing characteristic multinucleated germ cells. However, the mechanisms responsible for these effects are not fully understood. This review describes current knowledge of the adverse effects of phthalates on the fetal testis and their associated windows of sensitivity, and compares and contrasts the mechanisms by which toxicants of current interest, bisphenol A and its replacements, analgesics, and perfluorinated alkyl substances, alter testicular developmental processes. Working toward a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for phthalate toxicity will be critical for understanding the long-term impacts of environmental chemicals and pharmaceuticals on human reproductive health. © 2021 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; analgesic agent; antiandrogen; environmental chemical; perfluoro compound; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; phthalic acid; phthalic acid ester; testosterone; phthalic acid; phthalic acid derivative; cell function; cell maturation; cell survival; environmental exposure; estrogen activity; germ cell; human; Leydig cell; molecular biology; morphology; multinuclear cell; nonhuman; paracrine signaling; PPAR signaling; prenatal exposure; reproductive toxicity; Review; seminiferous tubule; sensitivity analysis; species difference; steroidogenesis; testicular dysgenesis; testis development; testis disease; testis function; testosterone synthesis; animal; endothelium cell; environmental exposure; fetus development; male; metabolism; Sertoli cell; testis; Animals; Endothelial Cells; Environmental Exposure; Fetal Development; Leydig Cells; Male; Phthalic Acids; Sertoli Cells; Testis"

Currently, patients suffering from diseased and injured organs are treated with transplanted organs or cells. This paper reviews recent advances that have occurred in regenerative medicine and describes application of new technologies to treat diseased or damaged organs and tissues. Recent findings: Although most current strategies for tissue engineering depend upon a sample of autologous cells from the diseased organ of the patient, biopsies from patients with extensive end-stage organ failure may not yield enough normal cells. In these situations, stem cells are envisioned as being an alternative source. Stem cells can be derived from discarded human embryos (human embryonic stem cells), from fetal tissue, or from adult sources (bone marrow, fat, skin). Therapeutic cloning offers a potentially limitless source of cells for tissue engineering applications.

Mercury accumulation in the environment has been a topic of continuing concern because of its extreme toxicity and its biomagnification through food webs resulting in increased human exposure. The toxicity of this element depends upon its chemical form: its organic form (methyl mercury MeHg (I)) being more toxic than its inorganic form (Hg (II)). Mercury, when released from most sources is deposited into sediments and soils where it may be converted to MeHg (I). Measuring concentrations of Hg species in sediments is important as sediments are considered as the sink for Hg and the main site of MeHg (I) production, eventually leading to bioaccumulation and biomagnification of Hg through food webs.This review summarises the published literature of procedures used to extract Hg from sediments and soils and the use of HPLC to separate and quantify Hg species and presents a synthesis of the strengths and limitations of analytical protocols used for extraction and HPLC-ICPMS separation and measurement of Hg species. Sediments should be freeze dried before extraction to preserve Hg species and ensure complete extraction. The extraction protocols belong to three categories: acid-base extraction, water distillation or organic solvents and sulfhydryl containing reagents. Acid or alkali extractions using microwave assisted heating or sonication gave higher MeHg (I) recoveries (80-120%) from sediments and sediment certified reference materials compared to the extractions using organic solvents or thiol containing reagents which gave MeHg (I) recoveries of 58-106%. Distillation using water, with and without additives also gave good extraction recoveries (87-108%), but suffers from MeHg (I) artefact formation. For the separation of Hg species extracted from sediment samples the majority of studies used reverse phase chromatography with either C8 or C18 columns with a mobile phase containing a thiol reagent such as cysteine, 2-mercaptoethanol or sodium pyrrolidine dithio carbamate. When chromatography is performed it is important that MeHg (I) elutes before Hg (II), as MeHg (I) concentrations in sediments are very low compared to the Hg (II) concentrations and peak tailing due to very high Hg (II) concentrations will not allow the quantification of MeHg (I) concentrations.Based on these studies we recommend extraction of Hg species using distillation or 2-mercaptoethanol. HPLC with the use of a C8 column and 2-mercaptoethanol in the mobile phase that elutes of MeHg (I) before Hg (II). The use of enriched Hg isotope allows corrections for MeHg (I) artefact formation and incomplete Hg extraction. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",NA

This problem has been tackled by regulatory bodies by proposing EQS for biota in EU water bodies and tolerable daily intake for food. The introduction of regulatory limits requires the availability of harmonised and validated analytical methods of sufficient sensitivity. This paper reviews recent advances in analytical methods for analysis of PFAS in aquatic organisms. The methods available for biota analysis are mostly based on three extraction procedures: ion-pair extraction, solvent liquid extraction, and alkaline digestion. The resulting extracts are then subjected to different clean-up or enrichment steps on solid adsorbents, for example graphitized carbon black, C18, and WAX phases. All methods reviewed in this work give reliable results but are partially validated only, because of the lack of certified reference materials and regular interlaboratory exercises. The few interlaboratory exercises performed on real unspiked samples did not afford satisfactory results for PFAS other than PFOS, especially for matrices with high lipid content, for example mussels. The reasons for those partially negative results have been identified, and can mainly be attributed to calibration procedures and availability and purity of standards. The urgent need for certified reference materials for this type of analysis is emphasized. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Alkaline digestion; Analytical method; Aquatic organisms; Biota analysis; Calibration procedure; Certified reference materials; Environmental problems; Extraction method; Extraction procedure; Graphitized carbon black; Interlaboratory exercise; Ion pairs; LC-MS; Lipid content; Liquid extraction; Perfluorinated compounds; Regulatory bodies; Regulatory limit; Solid adsorbents; Tolerable daily intake; Waterbodies; Biochemistry; Reviews; Carbon black; carbon; fluorocarbon; lipid; solvent; animal; aquatic species; bivalve; calibration; chemistry; environmental monitoring; Europe; fish; human; mass spectrometry; metabolism; methodology; pollutant; quality control; review; sensitivity and specificity; shellfish; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Bivalvia; Calibration; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Europe; Fishes; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Lipids; Mass Spectrometry; Quality Control; Sensitivity and Specificity; Shellfish; Solvents

NA,"Organic pollutants in deep sea: Occurrence, fate, and ecological implications",2021,NA,NA,"The deep sea - an oceanic layer below 200 m depths – has important global biogeochemical and nutrient cycling functions. It also receives organic pollutants from anthropogenic sources, which threatens the ecological function of the deep sea. In this Review, critically examined data on the distribution of organic pollutants in the deep sea to outline the role of biogeochemical and geophysical factors on the global distribution and regional chemodynamics of organic pollutants in the deep sea. We found that the contribution of deep water formation to the influx of perfluorinated compounds reached a maximum, following peak emission, faster in young deep waters (&lt; 10 years) compared to older deep waters (&gt; 100 years). For example, perfluorinated compounds had low concentrations (&lt; 10 pg L−1) and vertical variations in the South Pacific Ocean where the ocean currents are old (&lt; 1000 years). Steep geomorphologies of submarine canyons, ridges, and valleys facilitated the transport of sediments and associated organic pollutants by oceanic currents from the continental shelf to remote deep seas. In addition, we found that, even though an estimated 1.2–4.2 million metric tons of plastic debris enter the ocean through riverine discharge annually, the role of microplastics as vectors of organic pollutants (e.g., plastic monomers, additives, and attached organic pollutants) in the deep sea is often overlooked. Finally, we recommend assessing the biological effects of organic pollutants in deep sea biota, large-scale monitoring of organic pollutants, reconstructing historical emissions using sediment cores, and assessing the impact of deep-sea mining on the ecosystem. © 2021",NA

Determination of waste material and clay properties as well as processing conditions such as material composition, sintering temperature, and compaction pressure, which influence pore formation in ceramics, has been comprehensively provided. These factors significantly influence the properties of the resulting porous ceramics, including physical, mechanical, and toxicity properties. Recycling food, agricultural, and industrial wastes for increased energy saving and green ceramic production can be realized as an economical and practical approach to sustainable waste management, which align well with achieving sustainability in a circular economy and the UNESCO's Sustainability Development Goals (SDG).

The structural, reactivity and spectroscopic data yield a consistent picture whereby electron density is transferred from the chromium to both rings, but to a much greater extent to the fluorinated ligand. The result is a marked decrease in the stretching and bending vibrational modes of the fluorinated ring, and also dramatic changes in the 19F NMR chemical shifts and coupling constants.

This is an attempt to improve the management of affected babies and stimulate more research concerning new diagnostic tools. Recent findings: Current trends in the field of (early) diagnosis, such as: (1) imaging techniques, e.g. contrast radiography, portal vein ultrasonography, magnetic resonance, radionuclide scanning; (2) gastrointestinal tonometry; (3) the detection of biochemical markers, cytokines, growth factors; and (4) the determination of the mean peak hydrogen: carbon dioxide ratio excreted in breath, are only some of those mentioned. Various novel preventive techniques are also presented, among which platelet-activating factor acetyl hydrolase activity enhancement, platelet-activating factor receptor antagonists and probiotics, such as Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus acidophilus, seem quite promising. Regarding treatment, the use of oxygenated perfluorocarbon has added to the limited alternatives available.

Since Ras signalling is abnormally activated in more than 30% of human cancers, Ras and its downstream signalling pathways are considered good targets for therapeutic interference. Ras is post-translationally modified by the addition of a farnesyl group, which permits its attachment to the plasma membrane. Exploiting this knowledge, a synthetic Ras inhibitor, S-trans, trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS; Salirasib), was developed. FTS resembles the farnesylcysteine group of Ras, and acts as an effective Ras antagonist. In the present review, the effect of FTS in combination with various other drugs, as tested in vitro and in vivo, and its therapeutic potential are discussed.

This review summarizes the biological monitoring of PFCAs, PFSAs, and related PFSs in wildlife and humans, compares concentrations and contamination profiles among species and locations, evaluates the bioaccumulation/biomagnification in the environment, discusses possible sources, and identifies knowledge gaps. PFSs can reach elevated concentrations in humans and wildlife inhabiting industrialized areas of North America, Europe, and Asia (2-30 000 ng/mL or ng/g of wet weight (ww)). PFSs have also been detected in organisms from the Arctic and mid-ocean islands (≤3000 ng/g ww). In humans, PFSAs and PFCAs have been shown to vary among ethnic groups and PFCA/PFSA profiles differ from those in wildlife with high proportions of perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate. The pattern of contamination in wildlife varied among species and locations suggesting multiple emission sources. Food web analyses have shown that PFCAs and PFSAs can bioaccumulate and biomagnify in marine and freshwater ecosystems. Knowledge gaps with respect to the transport, accumulation, biodegradation, temporal/spatial trends and PFS precursors have been identified.

Numerous studies have provided evidence for an increase in this process in areas of pathology in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Because complement activation proteins have been demonstrated in vitro to exert both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects, the significance of this process in the development and progression of AD is unclear. Studies in animal models of AD, in which brain complement activation can be experimentally altered, should be of value for clarifying this issue. However, surprisingly little is known about complement activation in the transgenic animal models that are popular for studying this disorder. An optimal animal model for studying the significance of complement activation on Alzheimer's - related neuropathology should have complete complement activation associated with senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (if present), and dystrophic neurites. Other desirable features include both classical and alternative pathway activation, increased neuronal synthesis of native complement proteins, and evidence for an increase in complement activation prior to the development of extensive pathology. In order to determine the suitability of different animal models for studying the role of complement activation in AD, the extent of complement activation and its association with neuropathology in these models must be understood. © 2004 Loeffler; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",alternative complement pathway C3 C5 convertase; amyloid precursor protein; complement component C1q; complement component C1r; complement component C1s; complement component C3a; complement component C3b; complement component C3c; complement component C4a; complement component C4b; complement component C4d; complement component C5a; complement component C5b; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement membrane attack complex; cytokine; nerve growth factor; tau protein; transforming growth factor beta1; Alzheimer disease; antigen antibody complex; complement activation; disease association; disease course; encephalitis; experimental model; in vitro study; neurofibrillary tangle; neuropathology; neuropathy; neuroprotection; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; protein synthesis; review; senile plaque; transgenic animal

We performed a systematic literature review of the relevant literature of PubMed, Cochrane Library databases, Web of Science and Embase from the establishment to April 2020. Studies included the effects of PFOA on the reproductive system of male rodents. The meta-analysis was performed on the basis of the following points: level of testosterone and estradiol in serum, development of reproductive organs, pathological changes of reproduction organs and parameters of semen. A series of 16 studies was enrolled in this study. The standard mean difference (SMD) for PFOA-related reproductive toxicity was summarised as −0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71, −0.07). The lower serum testosterone levels, decreased absolute testicular and epididymal weights, higher serum estradiol levels, elevated relative testicular and seminal vesicle weights and increased incidence of Leydig cell adenoma and percentage of abnormal sperm were observed in the exposed group compared with the control group. However, no statistical difference was found in the day of preputial separation of pups and percentage of motile sperm. In conclusion, PFOA exposure heightens the reproductive system damage in male rodents. However, many studies included in the review did not identify mechanisms by which PFOA induces changes to the male reproductive system, which is an area for additional study. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Cell proliferation; Mammals; Confidence interval; Pathological changes; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Reproductive organs; Reproductive systems; Reproductive toxicities; Statistical differences; Systematic literature review; Toxicity; estradiol; perfluorooctanoic acid; testosterone; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; bioaccumulation; cell; ecophysiology; organic pollutant; pathology; pollution effect; pollution exposure; rodent; testosterone; drug exposure; estradiol blood level; incidence; male genital system; nonhuman; reproductive toxicity; seminal plasma; seminal vesicle; testosterone blood level; animal; male; meta analysis; reproduction; rodent; Rodentia; Animals; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Male; Reproduction; Rodentia

In this review, we focus on the factors determining chain lengths in fatty acid biosynthesis. In a nutshell, the process of chain-length regulation can be understood as the output of a chain-elongating C−C bond forming reaction competing with a terminating fatty acid release function. At the end of each cycle in the iterative process, the synthesizing enzymes need to “decide” whether the growing chain is to be elongated through another cycle or released as the “mature” fatty acid. Recent research has shed light on the factors determining fatty acid chain length and has also achieved control over chain length for the production of the technologically interesting short-chain (C4–C8) and medium-chain (C10–C14) fatty acids. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It is a first hormone linking gastrointestinal-pituitary axis. Objective: This review highlights the interaction of ghrelin with GHRH and somatostatin to regulate the secretion of GH and intends to explore the possible physiological role of the ghrelin-pituitary-GH axis linkage system. Observation: Ghrelin is highly conserved among species and is classified into octanoylated (C8:0), decanoylated (C10:0), decenoylated (C10:1) and nonacylated,ghrelin. Acylated ghrelin is the major active form of human ghrelin. The primary production site of ghrelin is the stomach, and it interacts with stomach ghrelin as well as hypothalamic GHRH and somatostatin in the regulation of pituitary GH secretion. Ghrelin stimulate GH release through the GHS receptor to increase intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+] levels via IP3 signal transduction pathway. Ghrelin is a specific endogenous ligand for the GHS receptor and provides a definitive proof of the occurance of a GHS-GHS receptor signalling system in the regulation of GH secretion. Conclusion: Studies suggests that ghrelin is a powerful pharmacological agent that exerts a potent, time-dependent stimulation of pulsatile secretion of GH.","acyltransferase; adenosine triphosphate; cyclic AMP; des glutamine 14 ghrelin; diacylglycerol; ghrelin; ghrelin o acyl transferase; ghrelin receptor; growth hormone; growth hormone releasing factor; growth hormone releasing peptide; growth hormone secretagogue; inositol trisphosphate; messenger RNA; n octanoylated ghrelin; peptide; phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 bisphosphate; protein c fos; somatomedin C; somatostatin; unclassified drug; drug efficacy; gene; ghrelin gene; growth hormone release; hormonal regulation; hormone action; hormone binding; human; hypophysis; hypothalamus; nonhuman; peptide synthesis; protein expression; protein structure; regulatory mechanism; review; signal transduction"

These studies demonstrated that PFAs could be as efficient as VitE in counteracting oxidative stress in pigs, rabbits, and ruminants. However, PFAs only positively affected animals’ growth performance and feed efficiency in some monogastric studies. The PFA can affect antioxidant enzyme activity in a dose-and method of administration-dependent manner. The antioxidant capacity of both PFA and VitE were depressed in cows fed with diets rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Variability among studies could be related to species differences.

They have a very wide range of applications, while they are persistent in the environment and exhibit bioaccumulative and toxic properties. Neither chemical nor biological mechanisms can decompose PFAS due to their strong C-F bonds. PFAS have shown adverse effects on various organisms, even at trace levels. Accordingly, highly sensitive and selective analytical methods are required for their tracing in biological and environmental matrices. The physicochemical properties of PFAS like surfactant characteristics and high-water solubility are unique and different from other known pollutants. Accordingly, the number of articles on the analysis of PFAS is less than the other well-known contaminants. The routine PFAS sample preparation methods (like solvent extraction) coupled with chromatographic systems, face challenges such as high limits of detection, need for laborious derivatization, limited selectivity, and expensive instrumentation. Recent efforts to address these limitations have aroused considerable attention to the development of microextraction techniques, which are consistent with the principles of green chemistry and can be made easily portable and automated. Moreover, these methods have shown enough sensitivity and selectivity for the analysis of different analytes (including PFAS) in a wide range of samples with different matrices.

CPN is constitutively active, whereas CPB2 circulates as a precursor, procarboxypeptidase B2 (proCPB2), that needs to be activated by the thrombin–thrombomodulin complex or plasmin bound to glycosaminoglycans. The substrate specificities of CPB2 and CPN are similar; they both remove C-terminal basic amino acids from bioactive peptides and proteins, thereby inactivating them. The complement cascade is a cascade of proteases and cofactors activated by pathogens or dead cells, divided into two phases, with the second phase only being triggered if sufficient C3b is present. Complement activation generates anaphylatoxins: C3a, which stimulates macrophages; and C5a, which is an activator and attractant for neutrophils. Pharmacological intervention with inhibitors has shown that CPB2 delays fibrinolysis, whereas CPN is responsible for systemic inactivation of C3a and C5a. Among mice genetically deficient in either CPB2 or CPN, in a model of hemolytic–uremic syndrome, Cpb2−/− mice had the worst disease, followed by Cpn−/− mice, with wild-type (WT) mice being the most protected. This model is driven by C5a, and shows that CPB2 is important in inactivating C5a.

These observations need to be confirmed in humans. Therefore, CPB2 and CPN have different roles.

The occurrence of ARVDs in water bodies raises concern because many communities in Africa depend on rivers for water resources. Southern Africa is a potential hotspot regarding ARVD contamination due to relatively high therapeutic application and detection thereof in water bodies. Efavirenz and nevirapine are the most persistent in effluents and are prevalent in surface water based on environmental concentrations. Whereas the highest concentration of efavirenz reported in Kenya was 12.4 µg L–1, concentrations as high as 119 and 140 µg L–1 have been reported in Zambia and South Africa, respectively. Concentrations of ARVDs ranging from 670 to 34 000 ng L–1 (influents) and 540 to 34 000 ng L–1 (effluents) were determined in wastewater treatment plants in South Africa, compared with Europe, where reported concentrations range from less than limit of detection (LOD) to 32 ng L–1 (influents) and less than LOD to 22 ng L–1 (effluents).

Ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC), a moderately new member of the carbonaceous family of adsorbents, has arisen as a potential adsorbent because of its distinct features such as high BET surface area, large pore size and porosity volume, tunable surface chemistry and thermo-mechanical stability. In this review paper, we have presented a systematic documentation of all the research efforts on OMC preparation, modification, characterization, and environmental application for pollutant removal. The subsequent characterizations of OMC employing different techniques, such as, N2 Adsorption-Desorption Isotherm, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images, X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) spectra, are summarized. Furthermore, we have compared the adsorption performance of different modified OMCs towards different inorganic pollutants, such as heavy metals, and various organic pollutants categorically, such as dyes, phenols and their derivatives, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), alkaloids, nitrogen containing organic compounds, and vitamins.

Generally, modification is desired at a single site to maintain homogeneity and to minimise loss of function. Though protein modification can be achieved by targeting some natural amino acid side chains, this often leads to ill-defined and randomly modified proteins. Amongst the natural amino acids, cysteine combines advantageous properties contributing to its suitability for site-selective modification, including a unique nucleophilicity, and a low natural abundance - both allowing chemo- and regioselectivity. Native cysteine residues can be targeted, or Cys can be introduced at a desired site in a protein by means of reliable genetic engineering techniques.

We describe recent developments in assessing pollutant exposures and health threats posed by industrial facilities using or releasing synthetic chemicals to nearby communities in the U.S. Recent Findings: More people are living near oil and gas development due to the expansion of unconventional extraction techniques as well as near industrial animal operations, both with suggestive evidence of increased exposure to hazardous pollutants and adverse health effects. Legacy contamination continues to adversely impact a new generation of residents in fenceline communities, with recent studies documenting exposures to toxic metals and poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Researchers are also giving consideration to acute exposures resulting from inadvertent industrial chemical releases, including those resulting from extreme weather events linked to climate change. Natural experiments of industrial closures or cleanups provide compelling evidence that exposures from industry harm the health of nearby residents. Summary: New and legacy industries, coupled with climate change, present unique health risks to communities living near industry due to the release of toxic chemicals.

NA,Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure in early life increases risk of childhood adiposity: A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies,2018,NA,NA,"Some articles have examined perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure in early life in relation to risk of childhood adiposity. Nevertheless, the results from epidemiological studies exploring the associations remain inconsistent and contradictory. We thus conducted an analysis of data currently available to examine the association between PFOA exposure in early life and risk of childhood adiposity. The PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify studies that examined the impact of PFOA exposure in early life on childhood adiposity. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to pool the statistical estimates. We identified ten prospective cohort studies comprising 6076 participants with PFOA exposure. The overall effect size (relative risk or odds ratio) for childhood overweight was 1.25 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.50; I2 = 40.5%). In addition, exposure to PFOA in early life increased the z-score of childhood body mass index (β = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.17; I2 = 27.9%). Accordingly, exposure to PFOA in early life is associated with an increased risk for childhood adiposity. Further research is needed to verify these findings and to shed light on the molecular mechanism of PFOA in adiposity. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",NA

In the current review, we focus on the calibration and use of passive samplers for PFASs in air and water. The comparison of the sampling rates generally showed a higher variability for the aqueous passive samplers compared to the passive air samplers. A better standardization for calibration methods for PFASs in air and water is needed.

To determine when uses of PFASs have an essential function in modern society, and when they do not, is not an easy task. Here, we: (1) develop the concept of ""essential use"" based on an existing approach described in the Montreal Protocol, (2) apply the concept to various uses of PFASs to determine the feasibility of elimination or substitution of PFASs in each use category, and (3) outline the challenges for phasing out uses of PFASs in society. In brief, we developed three distinct categories to describe the different levels of essentiality of individual uses. A phase-out of many uses of PFASs can be implemented because they are not necessary for the betterment of society in terms of health and safety, or because functional alternatives are currently available that can be substituted into these products or applications. Some specific uses of PFASs would be considered essential because they provide for vital functions and are currently without established alternatives. However, this essentiality should not be considered as permanent; rather, constant efforts are needed to search for alternatives. We provide a description of several ongoing uses of PFASs and discuss whether these uses are essential or non-essential according to the three essentiality categories. It is not possible to describe each use case of PFASs in detail in this single article. For follow-up work, we suggest further refining the assessment of the use cases of PFASs covered here, where necessary, and expanding the application of this concept to all other uses of PFASs. The concept of essential use can also be applied in the management of other chemicals, or groups of chemicals, of concern. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",Follow up; Health and safety; Montreal Protocols; Non essential; OR applications; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; case report; clinical article; feasibility study; follow up; human; review; analysis; environmental exposure; pollutant; pollution; prevention and control; toxicity; fluorocarbon; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Environmental Pollution; Fluorocarbons; Humans

Global health crisis is associated with the fast development of antimicrobial resistance, as more and more infectious diseases cannot be treated more than once. Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin are the most commonly detected antibiotics in water systems worldwide. The persistent and toxic nature of these antibiotics makes their elimination by conventional treatment methods at wastewater treatment plants almost impossible. The application of advanced oxidation processes and heterogeneous photocatalysis over TiO2‐based materials is a promising solution. This highly efficient technology has the potential to be sustainable, cost‐efficient and energy‐efficient. A comprehensive review on the application of various TiO2‐based photocatalysts for the degradation of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin is focused on highlighting their photocatalytic performance under various reaction conditions (different amounts of pollutant and photocatalyst, pH, light source, reaction media, presence of inorganic ions, natural organic matter, oxidants). Mineralization efficiency and ecotoxicity of final products have been also considered. Further research needs have been presented based on the literature findings.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic evidence map (SEM) is to summarize the epidemiology evidence on approximately 150 lesser studied PFAS prioritized by the EPA for tiered toxicity testing, facilitating interpretation of those results as well as identification of priorities for risk assessment and data gaps for future research. METHODS: The Populations, Exposure, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were intentionally broad to identify studies of any health effects in humans with information on associations with exposure to the identified PFAS. Systematic review methods were used to search for literature that was screened using machine-learning software and manual review. Studies meeting the PECO criteria underwent quantitative data extraction and evaluation for risk of bias and sensitivity using the Integrated Risk Information System approach. RESULTS: 193 epidemiology studies were identified, which included information on 15 of the PFAS of interest. The most commonly studied health effect categories were metabolic (n = 37), endocrine (n = 30), cardiovascular (30), female reproductive (n = 27), developmental (n = 26), immune (n = 22), nervous (n = 21), male reproductive (n = 14), cancer (n = 12), and urinary (n = 11) effects. In study evaluation, 120 (62%) studies were con-sidered High/Medium confidence for at least one outcome. DISCUSSION: Most of the PFAS in this SEM have little to no epidemiology data available to inform evaluation of potential health effects. Although exposure to the 15 PFAS that had data was fairly low in most studies, these less-studied PFAS may be used as replacements for “legacy” PFAS, leading to potentially greater exposure. It is impractical to generate epidemiology evidence to fill the existing gaps for all potentially relevant PFAS. This SEM highlights some of the important research gaps that currently exist. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

They are reported as ubiquitous pollutants in different spheres of the environment due to the presence of physical bonding with the polymeric matrix. In animals, including humans, they are known to cause various toxic effects. Nevertheless, less attention has been paid to phthalate induced stress in plants, since plants are equally vulnerable to their exposure as they are immobile and being an important component of the environment cannot be ignored. Moreover, due to their frequent detection in higher amounts in agricultural soils globally, significant concern has been raised about phthalate induced stress in plants over the past decade. The main sources of phthalate in agricultural soils are the use of plastic mulching, irrigation with wastewater, pesticide spraying, use of biosolids for improving soil properties, etc. From the soils, phthalates could enter into plants mainly via roots and undergo biomagnification at different trophic levels in an ecosystem. Phthalates were declared as endocrine disruptors thereby, their accumulation in edible plants raises food security concerns. Moreover, the accumulation of phthalates in plants is observed to affect germination, growth and development as well as reported to interfere with normal plant metabolism which led to modulations in the content of pigments, osmolytes, stress biomarkers and activities of antioxidative enzymes, thus reducing the yield and quality of edible plants. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",NA

The widespread use and stability of PFASs provide many opportunities for human exposure to these contaminants. In recent years, our understanding of PFASs as contaminants in vegetation has increased considerably. PFASs are taken up, transformed and accumulated in various compartments of plants, and the rate of these processes depends on environmental conditions, compound-specific characteristics, plant species, and other competing factors. This review summarizes the recent findings on the uptake, accumulation, distribution and metabolism of PFASs in higher plants, with a specific focus on plant metabolism pathways of representative polyfluoroalkyl compounds. The potential risk of PFASs in plant-origin food for human exposure is also discussed. Further studies on plant metabolism of polyfluoroalkyl chemicals are in urgent need to fill the data gaps and allow a comprehensive understanding of plant metabolism pathways.

This is compounded by variable regulatory oversight with respect to storage, use and waste management of these chemicals and their byproducts. This review synthesizes the data on the distribution of selected persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in waters in China. Surface water heavily polluted with POPs is distributed in the Yangtze River Estuary, Pearl River Delta, Minjiang River Estuary, Jiulongjiang Estuary, Daya Bay, Taihu Lake, and the waterways of Zhejiang Province, where concentrations of Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) frequently exceed both international and Chinese guideline values. These areas are mainly distributed along the southeast coast of China, within or downstream of major manufacturing districts, intensive agricultural basins, and other industrial centers. A comparison of the levels of OCPs in the aquatic environment of China with other indicative regions worldwide shows comparable levels of pollution (overall range from below detection limit (BDL) to 5104.8 ng/L and regional means from 2.9–929.6 ng/L). PAHs and PCBs pollution appear to be particularly serious in China (PAHs overall ranging from BDL to 474,000 ng/L with regional means from 15.1–72,400 ng/L; PCBs from BDL to 3161 ng/L with regional means ranging from 0.2–985.2 ng/L). There is as yet limited evidence of serious perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) pollution. We discuss major sources and processes responsible for high POP occurrence using a range of measures (including diagnostic ratios of different compounds), regulatory oversight and policy gaps in the control of POPs in China, and potential long-term health and ecological effects. We argue that water quality guidelines, pollution control measures and cleanup strategies for POPs in China should be urgently improved. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Aromatic compounds; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Byproducts; Compounding (chemical); Digital storage; Estuaries; Hydrocarbons; Lake pollution; Organic chemicals; Pesticides; Pollution; Pollution control; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Quality control; River pollution; Rivers; Surface waters; Waste management; Water analysis; Water pollution; Water pollution control; Water quality; Waterworks; China; Organochlorine pesticides; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Organic pollutants; organochlorine pesticide; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative; concentration (composition); organochlorine pesticide; PAH; PCB; persistent organic pollutant; surface water; water pollution; water quality; China; ecosystem monitoring; estuary; limit of detection; persistent organic pollutant; pollution control; Review; risk factor; river basin; sea pollution; sea surface waters; waste water management; water quality; China; Daya Bay; Fujian; Guangdong; Jiulong Estuary; Minjiang Estuary; Taihu Lake; Yangtze Estuary; Zhujiang Delta

Publications on this topic dated back to 1890 and were summarized in a review published in 2009 by the journal Hydrobiologia, accounting for high citation rates (i.e. 117 citations Scopus and 232 citations Google Scholar, October 2020). This wide interest stimulates the authors to further unravel teratological forms significance in the light of the most recent publications (2010–2020). Diatom teratological forms are one of the best individual-level biomarkers since they provide a rapid response to several environmental stressors, including new emerging pollutants. The mechanisms involved in teratological valve likely involve both cytoskeleton and silicon metabolic pathway impairments. However, teratologies do not seem to weaken the reproduction capacity and viability of the affected individuals. We recognized eight types of teratologies as involving different parts of the valve, depending on genus. In order to summarize the information obtained by several years of research, we suggest a four-step procedure aimed at providing a theoretical pathway that researchers should follow to better explain results obtained in next-future studies and representing a starting point for the development of an environmental index based on teratological forms. © 2021, The Author(s).",biomarker; diatom; environmental stress; literature review; reproduction; silicon; Bacillariophyceae; Bacillariophyta; Scopus

The goals of the present review are to assess the state of the science regarding toxicological effects of PFAS and to develop strategies for advancing knowledge on the health effects of this large family of chemicals. Currently, much of the toxicity data available for PFAS are for a handful of chemicals, primarily legacy PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate. Epidemiological studies have revealed associations between exposure to specific PFAS and a variety of health effects, including altered immune and thyroid function, liver disease, lipid and insulin dysregulation, kidney disease, adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes, and cancer. Concordance with experimental animal data exists for many of these effects. However, information on modes of action and adverse outcome pathways must be expanded, and profound differences in PFAS toxicokinetic properties must be considered in understanding differences in responses between the sexes and among species and life stages. With many health effects noted for a relatively few example compounds and hundreds of other PFAS in commerce lacking toxicity data, more contemporary and high-throughput approaches such as read-across, molecular dynamics, and protein modeling are proposed to accelerate the development of toxicity information on emerging and legacy PFAS, individually and as mixtures. In addition, an appropriate degree of precaution, given what is already known from the PFAS examples noted, may be needed to protect human health.

Given their shared commitment to exploring emergent forms of power in the contemporary world, there is surprisingly little dialogue between FTS and mainstream cultural anthropology. This review begins by outlining FTS and its concepts and methods. I then turn to the anthropology of technology, which also offers useful conceptual frameworks and methods for exploring gender regimes. Then, to highlight the ideological and methodological contrasts between social and cultural analyses of technology and the implications for gender analysis, I discuss the treatment of technology in two leading theoretical fields in the cultural anthropology of modernity and globalization: the anthropology of technoscience, and material culture studies. I conclude by asking which forms of engagement might be envisaged between the fields. Copyright © 2007 by Annual Reviews.

OTA is nephrotoxic and is suspected of being the main etiological agent responsible for human Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) and associated urinary tract tumours. Striking similarities between OTA-induced porcine nephropathy in pigs and BEN in humans are observed. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified OTA as a possible human carcinogen (group 2B). Currently, the mode of carcinogenic action by OTA is unknown. OTA is genotoxic following oxidative metabolism. This activity is thought to play a central role in OTA-mediated carcinogenesis and may be divided into direct (covalent DNA adduction) and indirect (oxidative DNA damage) mechanisms of action. Evidence for a direct mode of genotoxicity has been derived from the sensitive 32P-postlabelling assay. OTA facilitates guanine-specific DNA adducts in vitro and in rat and pig kidney orally dosed, one adduct comigrates with a synthetic carbon (C)-bonded C8-dG OTA adduct standard. In this paper, our current understanding of OTA toxicity and carcinogenicity are reviewed. The available evidence suggests that OTA is a genotoxic carcinogen by induction of oxidative DNA lesions coupled with direct DNA adducts via quinone formation. This mechanism of action should be used to establish acceptable intake levels of OTA from human food sources. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

NA,"The occurrence, exposure and risk assessment of perfluoroalkyl acids in food from mainland, China",2017,NA,NA,"To study the contamination of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in Chinese food and the risk of dietary exposure for the Chinese population, the data of 17 PFAAs covering 38 cities throughout China in 15 groups of foods were collected for meta-analysis from published and available research literature. Using food consumption and body weight parameters, estimated dietary intakes (EDIs) were calculated for evaluation using the Scenario-Based Risk Assessment (SceBRA) modelling. Among food groups, the highest ΣPFAAs concentrations and EDI contributions were both found in poultry (363 ng/g), fish and shrimp (313 ng/g), dark vegetables (309 ng/g), fruits (116 ng/g) and pork (25 ng/g). The EDI of adults in the high-exposure scenario was about twice that of the intermediate-exposure scenario, while the EDI of children was about twice that of adults’ EDI in the intermediate-exposure scenario. In addition, the PFOS EDI for children under high exposure approached its tolerable daily intake (TDI). Therefore high dietary exposure to PFAAs is giving rise to an increased health risk, especially for children. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",NA

However, it is becoming apparent that current insulin-sensitising antihyperglycaemic therapy, represented by the biguanide metformin and the thiazolidionediones (TZD) pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, may exert powerful adjunctive anti-inflammatory actions with the potential to modify not only dysmetabolic cardiovascular disease but also Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) incidence. Such anti-inflammatory attributes may be shared by a variety of diverse traditional cardiovascular therapies, including renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, oestrogen receptor modulators, β1-adrenoceptor blockers, statins, fibrates and aspirin, as well as insulin itself. Recognising the relationships between inflammatory mediators and processes, and the pathophysiology of oxidative stress, vascular endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell decompensation, is likely to introduce a new treatment paradigm in the management of syndrome X, T2DM and dysmetabolic cardiovascular disease. Such a paradigm, in addition to justifying the further development of anti-inflammatory TZD and non-TZD peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonists, can also be expected to clinically target markers of systemic inflammation, cell adhesion molecule expression, mononucleocyte activation, reactive oxygen species generation, and intracellular redox-sensitive, pro-inflammatory transcription factor activation. Anti-inflammatory treatment modalities may therefore therapeutically exploit the common inflammatory basis of metabolic and cardiovascular disease.","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; acetylsalicylic acid; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antidiabetic agent; antiinflammatory agent; autacoid; beta 1 adrenergic receptor blocking agent; biguanide derivative; cell adhesion molecule; cytokine; fatty acid derivative; fibric acid derivative; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; metformin; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; pioglitazone; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; ramipril; reactive oxygen metabolite; renin inhibitor; rosiglitazone; salicylate sodium; selective estrogen receptor modulator; transcription factor; unindexed drug; antiinflammatory activity; atherosclerosis; biosynthesis; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular system; chronic inflammation; correlation analysis; disease severity; drug mechanism; drug sensitization; drug targeting; human; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; leukocyte activation; metabolic disorder; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; monocyte; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidative stress; pancreas insufficiency; pancreas islet beta cell; pathophysiology; protein expression; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; review; vascular endothelium"

Although attention to effects of exposure to mixtures of PFAS has grown in recent years, there is no consensus on the appropriate statistical methods that can be used to assess their combined effect on human health. Objectives: We aim to perform a comprehensive review of the statistical methods used in the existing studies which evaluate the association between exposure to mixtures of PFAS and any adverse human health effect. Methods: The online databases PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched for eligible studies, published during the last ten years (last search performed on April 08, 2021). Covidence software was used by two different reviewers to perform a title/abstract screening, followed by a full text revision of the selected papers. Results: A total of 3640 papers were identified, and after the screening process, 53 papers were included in the current review. Most of the studies were published between 2019 and 2021 and were conducted mainly in North America and Europe; more than half of the studies (28 out of 53) were conducted on mother and child pairs. WQS (Weighted Quantile Sum) Regression and BKMR (Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression) were used in 36 out of 53 papers to model mixtures’ effects. Health outcomes included in the studies are immunotoxicity (n = 8), fetal development (n = 7), neurodevelopment (n = 9), reproductive hormones (n = 6), thyroid hormones (n = 7), outcomes related to metabolic pathways (n = 16). Conclusion: Studies on human exposure to PFAS as complex mixtures and health consequences have substantially increased in the last few years. Based on our findings, we propose that addressing risk from PFAS mixtures will likely require combinations of approaches and implementation of constantly evolving statistical methods. Specific guidelines and tools for quality assessment and publication of mixture observational studies are warranted. © 2021",alkyl group; environmental chemical; perfluoroalkanoic acid; sex hormone; thyroid hormone; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; thyroid hormone; chemical substance; health impact; literature review; pollution exposure; public health; statistical analysis; adolescent; adult; aged; Bayes theorem; child; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; clinical outcome; controlled study; environmental exposure; Europe; female; fetus development; health hazard; homeostasis; hormone metabolism; human; immunotoxicity; k means clustering; least square analysis; male; nerve cell differentiation; nervous system development; North America; outcome assessment; population exposure; Review; risk assessment; structural equation modeling; systematic review; thyroid gland; pollutant; toxicity; Europe; North America; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Bayes Theorem; Child; Environmental Pollutants; Europe; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Thyroid Hormones

HPLC chromatograms provide fast identification by retention time, tR, and precise quantitation by measurement of peak height or peak area. For separation of tetracycline compounds, most HPLC methods use reversed-phase C18 or C8 columns and UV detection. The HPLC solvent system should have a pH of about 6 to prevent steric changes in the tetracycline molecule. For accurate quantitation it is necessary to avoid tailing and this is accomplished by adding a zwitter ion to the solvent system. Methanol and acetonitrile are frequently used as organic modifiers in these solvent systems. In a single analysis, HPLC methods can be used to separate as many as nine or ten commercially used tetracycline compounds and to determine four to five tetracyclines in commercial tetracycline preparations or in biological fluids. © 1985 Friedr.

Immunomodulation and epigenetic regulation have been hypothesized as mediators of this relationship, but the precise underlying molecular mechanisms are not well-characterized. This review examines the evidence for epigenetic modification at the intersection of COVID-19 and environmental chemical exposures. Recent Findings: Numerous environmental contaminants including air pollutants, toxic metal(loid)s, per- and polyfluorinated substances, and endocrine disrupting chemicals are hypothesized to increase susceptibility to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the risk of severe COVID-19, but few studies currently exist. Drawing on evidence that many environmental chemicals alter the epigenetic regulation of key immunity genes and pathways, we discuss how exposures likely perturb host antiviral responses. Specific mechanisms vary by contaminant but include general immunomodulation as well as regulation of viral entry and recognition, inflammation, and immunologic memory pathways, among others. Summary: Associations between environmental contaminants and COVID-19 are likely mediated, in part, by epigenetic regulation of key immune pathways involved in the host response to SARS-CoV-2. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","endocrine disruptor; adverse event; environmental exposure; genetic epigenesis; genetics; human; COVID-19; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Epigenesis, Genetic; Humans; SARS-CoV-2"

Although many studies have reported an association between PFOA exposure and the risk of developing hepatic diseases, it is still in debate because they have shown conflicting results. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the relationship between PFOA exposure and hepatic diseases. Methods: This study searched studies related to hepatic diseases due to PFOA exposure until 31 December 2021, using PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. This study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis through research question development, literature screening, data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation. This study found 8280 studies after excluding duplicate literature and selected 5 studies in the final stage. Among them, two studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results: The results of the meta-analysis showed that the ALT of people exposed to PFOA was 117% higher than the ALT of those not exposed to PFOA, and it was significantly different (OR = 1.167; 95% CI, 1.086–1.254). Conclusion: However, since the number of studies included in the analysis was not large enough to conclude that PFOA exposure was associated with the development of hepatic diseases, more observational studies are needed to confirm its long-term effects. © 2022 by the authors.",perfluorooctanoic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; water; hepatitis; literature review; meta-analysis; persistent organic pollutant; pollution exposure; alanine aminotransferase blood level; data extraction; disease association; exposure; human; liver; liver disease; meta analysis (topic); publication bias; Review; systematic review; meta analysis; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Liver Diseases; Water

A survey of the application of several homo- and heterogeneous catalysts, their activity and the parameters influencing the efficiency of catalytic systems is presented here as a short overview, the aim of which is to raise awareness of possible new approaches to water purification. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Due to their chemical stability, PFAS represent a major cause of environmental pollution. PFAS accumulate in animal and human blood and tissues exerting their toxicity. We performed a review of the epidemiological studies exploring the relationship between exposure to PFAS and thromboembolic cardiovascular disease. An increase in cardiovascular disease or death related to PFAS exposure has been reported from cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies with evidence concerning the relation with early vascular lesions and atherosclerosis. Several studies indicate an alteration in lipid and glucose metabolism disorders and increased blood pressure as a possible link with cardiovascular thromboembolic events. We also examined the recent evidence indicating that legacy and new PFAS can be incorporated in platelet cell membranes giving a solid rationale to the observed increase risk of cardiovascular events in the populations exposed to PFAS by directly promoting thrombus formation. Exposure to PFAS has been related to altered plasma membrane fluidity and associated with altered calcium signal and increased platelet response to agonists, both in vitro and ex vivo in subjects exposed to PFAS. All the functional responses are increased in platelets by incorporation of PFAS: adhesion, aggregation, microvesicles release and experimental thrombus formation. These findings offer mechanistic support the hypothesis that platelet-centred mechanisms may be implicated in the increase in cardiovascular events observed in populations chronically exposed to PFAS. © Copyright © 2021 Meneguzzi, Fava, Castelli and Minuz.",NA

Hence, the efficacious removal of emerging pollutants, like pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, beta blockers and analgesics, from wastewater has recently been a major area of concern for the researchers, since these biorefractory compounds can bioaccumulate in living beings and can also transform into other toxic compounds in the natural environment. Since pharmaceuticals are not efficiently removed through conventional wastewater treatment technologies; hence, trace concentrations of these can be found in the treated effluent. Thus, the development of reliable and efficient treatment technologies for the removal of pharmaceuticals is imperative. Electrocoagulation (EC) can treat these compounds effectively. In this review, the application of EC for the removal of pharmaceuticals, critical parameters that influence the treatment efficiency, comparison of EC with chemical coagulation and the economics pertaining to EC have been discussed. The presence of different pharmaceuticals in wastewater, their respective concentrations and their adverse effects on the ecosystem have also been elucidated. Thus, this state-of-the-art review provides updated information on the application of EC for the removal of pharmaceuticals and assists readers to take this technology a step forward for commercialization to produce treated water safely for different reuse purposes. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Antibiotics; Chemical water treatment; Coagulation; Ecosystems; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Pollution; Water conservation; Biorefractory compounds; Chemical coagulations; Pharmaceutical compounds; State-of-the art reviews; Trace concentrations; Treatment efficiency; Updated informations; Wastewater treatment technologies; Wastewater treatment

Accordingly, this article systematically and critically reviews the epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFOA and PFOS and various immune-related health conditions in humans. Twenty-four epidemiologic studies have reported associations of PFOA and/or PFOS with immune-related health conditions, including ten studies of immune biomarker levels or gene expression patterns, ten studies of atopic or allergic disorders, five studies of infectious diseases, four studies of vaccine responses, and five studies of chronic inflammatory or autoimmune conditions (with several studies evaluating multiple endpoints). Asthma, the most commonly studied condition, was evaluated in seven studies. With few, often methodologically limited studies of any particular health condition, generally inconsistent results, and an inability to exclude confounding, bias, or chance as an explanation for observed associations, the available epidemiologic evidence is insufficient to reach a conclusion about a causal relationship between exposure to PFOA and PFOS and any immune-related health condition in humans. When interpreting such studies, an immunodeficiency should not be presumed to exist when there is no evidence of a clinical abnormality. Large, prospective studies with repeated exposure assessment in independent populations are needed to confirm some suggestive associations with certain endpoints. © 2016 Exponent, Inc.

NA,Drinking water pollutants may affect the immune system: concerns regarding COVID-19 health effects,2021,NA,NA,"The current coronavirus pandemic is leading to significant impacts on the planet, changing our way of life. Although the COVID-19 virus mechanisms of action and pathogenesis are still under extensive research, immune system effects are evident, leading, in many cases, to respiratory distress. Although apparent pollution reduction has been noticed by the population, environmental and human health impacts due to the increased use of plastic waste and disinfectants is concerning. One of the main routes of human exposure to pollutants is through drinking water. Thus, this point of view discusses some major contaminants in drinking water known to be immunotoxic, exploring sources and drinking water routes and emphasizing the known mechanisms of action that could likely compromise the effective immune response of humans, particularly raising concerns regarding people exposed to the COVID-19 virus. Based on a literature review, metals, plastic components, plasticizers, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances may display the potential to exacerbate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms, although epidemiological studies are still required to confirm the synergistic effects between these pollutants and the virus. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",NA

Chemicals with structures similar to the drugs and stimulants restricted by law are sold as medicines that are not so restricted. Furthermore, drugs that have evaded attention of the law and abuse of these drugs are increasing rapidly. Serious health hazards are occurring from abuse of these chemicals as well as existing abused drugs: they are thus causing a major social problem. Synthetic cannabinoids, one of these illegal drugs, is called ""spice"" and its abuse is spreading all over the world. So far, Germany and Japan have analyzed the ingredients of the spice series. Synthetic cannabinoids that have actually been detected include CP-47497 and its variations with different numbers of carbon atoms in the side chain, i.e., CP-47497-(C8), JWH-018, etc. Cases of drug dependence and health hazards, such as mental diseases, caused by abuse of spice have been reported, revealing their danger. Numerous synthetic cannabinoid derivatives emerged during the development of medicines, and the methods for synthesizing them and the strength of their binding affinity with the cannabinoid receptor have also been clarified. Under current conditions, when particular synthetic cannabinoid derivatives are restricted, others soon replace them. Although the biochemical characteristics of synthetic cannabinoid derivatives, such as binding affinity with receptors, have been clarified, actions of synthetic cannabinoid derivatives that are taken are still unknown for most derivatives. Some cannabinoid derivatives exhibit tens of times the strength of delta 9-THC, an ingredient of hemp, so it is feared that taking them may cause unexpected serious health hazards.",cannabinoid; addiction; human; review; Cannabinoids; Humans; Substance-Related Disorders

In addition to cooperative effects arising from the proximity of the mercury(II) centers, the electron-withdrawing properties of the backbone and the accessibility of the electrophilic sites lead to the facile complexation of neutral and electron rich substrates. The planarity of the structure as well as its overall polarizability compounded with relativistic effects at mercury also permits the occurrence of non-covalent interactions and accounts for the tendency of this compound to form cofacial dimers. Collectively, the Lewis acidic properties of 1 as well as its ability to engage in non-covalent interactions can be held responsible for its ability to form extended binary supramolecular stacks with arenes.

In addition to the primary pathogens Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei, several species have emerged as opportunistic pathogens in persons suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF) and immunocompromised individuals. All Burkholderia species investigated so far employ quorum-sensing (QS) systems that rely on N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signal molecules to express certain phenotypic traits in a population density-dependent manner. Whilst many Burkholderia strains only contain the CepI/CepR QS system, which relies on C8-HSL, some strains, in particular isolates of B. pseudomallei and B. mallei, harbour multiple LuxI/LuxR homologues and produce numerous AHL signal molecules. Evidence has accumulated over the past few years that the QS systems operating in Burkholderia are crucial for full virulence in various animal models. However, only few QS-regulated functions required for virulence in the different infection models have so far been identified. Given the essential role of QS in the expression of pathogenic traits in Burkholderia these regulatory systems represent attractive targets for the development of novel therapeutics. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

Mutations in either gene lead to the same disease phenotype, characterized by abnormal accumulation of free cholesterol, sphingolipids and other lipids in late endosomes or lysosomes in tissues throughout the body. This accumulation is associated with severe neurodegeneration and dysfunction of visceral organs such as the liver and spleen. This review summarizes the many approaches that have been investigated for developing small-molecule drug therapies for NPC.

Thousands of distinct PFAS exist in commerce. The 2019 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Action Plan outlines a multiprogram national research plan to address the challenge of PFAS. One component of this strategy involves the use of systematic evidence map (SEM) approaches to characterize the evidence base for hundreds of PFAS. OBJECTIVE: SEM methods were used to summarize available epidemiological and animal bioassay evidence for a set of ∼ 150 PFAS that were prioritized in 2019 by the U.S. EPA’s Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) for in vitro toxicity and toxicokinetic assay testing. METHODS: Systematic review methods were used to identify and screen literature using manual review and machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify mammalian animal bioassay and epidemiological studies that could inform human hazard identification. A variety of supplemental content was also tracked, including information on in vitro model systems; exposure measurement–only studies in humans; and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Animal bioassay and epidemiology studies meeting PECO criteria were summarized with respect to study design, and health system(s) were assessed. Because animal bioassay studies with ≥21-d exposure duration (or reproductive/developmental study design) were most useful to CCTE analyses, these studies underwent study evaluation and detailed data extraction. All data extraction is publicly available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata. RESULTS: More than 40,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes identified 44 animal and 148 epidemiology studies from the peer-reviewed literature and 95 animal and 50 epidemiology studies from gray literature that met PECO criteria. Epidemiological evidence (available for 15 PFAS) mostly assessed the reproductive, endocrine, developmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Animal evidence (available for 40 PFAS) commonly assessed effects in the reproductive, developmental, urinary, immunological, and hepatic systems. Overall, 45 PFAS had evidence across animal and epidemiology data streams. DISCUSSION: Many of the ∼ 150 PFAS were data poor. Epidemiological and animal evidence were lacking for most of the PFAS included in our search. By disseminating this information, we hope to facilitate additional assessment work by providing the initial scoping literature survey and identifying key research needs. Future research on data-poor PFAS will help support a more complete understanding of the potential health effects from PFAS exposures. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are representatives of PFASs. Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) set the health advisory level as 70 parts per trillion for lifetime exposure to PFOS and PFOA from drinking water, based on the EPA’s 2016 Health Effects Support Documents. Then, a monograph on PFOA was made available online by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, where the agency classified PFOA as “possibly carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2B). The distinction between PFOS and PFOA, however, may not be easily understood from the above documents. This paper discussed differential toxicity between PFOS and PFOA focusing on neurotoxicity, developmental toxicity and carcinogenicity, mainly based on these documents. The conclusions are as follows: Further mechanistic studies may be necessary for ultrasonic-induced PFOS-specific neurotoxicity. To support the hypothesis for PFOS-specific neonatal death that PFOS interacts directly with components of natural lung surfactant, in vivo studies to relate the physicochemical effects to lung collapse may be required. PFOA-induced DNA damage secondary to oxidative stress may develop to mutagenicity under the condition where PFOA-induced apoptosis is not sufficient to remove the damaged cells. A study to find whether PFOA induces apoptosis in normal human cells may contribute to assessment of human carcinogenicity. Studies for new targets such as hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) may help clarify the underlying mechanism for PFOA-induced carcinogenicity. © 2016, Japanese Society of Toxicology.

We aim to provide an overview of available effect biomarkers for monitoring chemical exposures in the general and occupational populations, and highlight their potential in monitoring humans exposed to chemical mixtures. We also discuss the role of the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework and physiologically based kinetic and dynamic (PBK/D) modelling to strengthen the understanding of the biological mechanism of effect biomarkers, and in particular for use in regulatory risk assessments. An interdisciplinary network of experts from the European chapter of the International Society for Exposure Science (ISES Europe) and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Occupational Biomonitoring activity of Working Parties of Hazard and Exposure Assessment group worked together to map the conventional framework of biomarkers and provided recommendations for their systematic use. We summarized the key aspects of this work here, and discussed these in three parts. Part I, we inventory available effect biomarkers and promising new biomarkers for the general population based on the H2020 Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) initiative. Part II, we provide an overview AOP and PBK/D modelling use that improved the selection and interpretation of effect biomarkers. Part III, we describe the collected expertise from the OECD Occupational Biomonitoring subtask effect biomarkers in prioritizing relevant mode of actions (MoAs) and suitable effect biomarkers. Furthermore, we propose a tiered risk assessment approach for occupational biomonitoring. Several effect biomarkers, especially for use in occupational settings, are validated. They offer a direct assessment of the overall health risks associated with exposure to chemicals, chemical mixtures and their transformation products. Promising novel effect biomarkers are emerging for biomonitoring of the general population. Efforts are being dedicated to prioritizing molecular and biochemical effect biomarkers that can provide a causal link in exposure-health outcome associations. This mechanistic approach has great potential in improving human health risk assessment. New techniques such as in silico methods (e.g. QSAR, PBK/D modelling) as well as ‘omics data will aid this process. Our multidisciplinary review represents a starting point for enhancing the identification of effect biomarkers and their mechanistic pathways following the AOP framework. This may help in prioritizing the effect biomarker implementation as well as defining threshold limits for chemical mixtures in a more structured way. Several ex vivo biomarkers have been proposed to evaluate combined effects including genotoxicity and xeno-estrogenicity. There is a regulatory need to derive effect-based trigger values using the increasing mechanistic knowledge coming from the AOP framework to address adverse health effects due to exposure to chemical mixtures. Such a mechanistic strategy would reduce the fragmentation observed in different regulations. It could also stimulate a harmonized use of effect biomarkers in a more comparable way, in particular for risk assessments to chemical mixtures. © 2020 The Author(s)",Biohazards; Health; Health risks; Indicators (chemical); International cooperation; Mixtures; Risk assessment; Adverse health effects; Biological mechanisms; Environmental chemicals; Human health risk assessment; International society; Organization for economic co-operation and development; Tiered risk assessment; Transformation products; Biomarkers; acrylamide; arsenic; bisphenol; cadmium; chemical compound; chromium; flame retardant; lead; mercury; mycotoxin; organophosphate; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pesticide; phthalic acid; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; unclassified drug; biological marker; biomarker; biomonitoring; health risk; occupational exposure; OECD; physiological response; pollution exposure; public health; risk assessment; adverse outcome pathway; age; allergy; anxiety disorder; asthma; atherosclerosis; attention deficit disorder; autoimmune disease; biological monitoring; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; cerebrovascular accident; degenerative disease; depression; developmental toxicity; disease predisposition; fatty liver; fertility; genital system disease; glomerulonephritis; human; immunopathology; immunotoxicity; intelligence quotient; ischemic heart disease; kidney tubule disorder; liver injury; lung toxicity; male infertility; malignant neoplasm; metabolic disorder; metabolic syndrome X; model; mutagenicity; neurotoxicity; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; physiological stress; physiologically based kinetic and dynamic modelling; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; puberty; reproductive toxicity; Review; risk assessment; teratogenesis; working memory; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; Europe; Biological Monitoring; Biomarkers; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Humans; Risk Assessment

The International Continence Society defines UI as the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine that is objectively demonstrated and is a social and hygienic problem. It is caused by a wide range of factors and it has a great negative impact on the lifestyle of patients, as well as a burden on the healthcare system, since it affects an estimated 10 million patients in the USA. Approximately 50% of all nursing home residents and between 15 and 30% of women over the age of 65 years have UI. The treatment modalities vary according to the underlying causes and the results are often unsatisfactory. With the introduction of the artificial urinary sphincter there has been a dramatic change in the management of refractory cases of UI. The artificial urinary sphincter is a device, usually in the form of an inflatable silicone cuff, inserted around the bladder neck or around the bulbous urethra in adult males. It mimics the biological urinary sphincter by providing a competent bladder outlet during urinary storage and an open outlet to permit voluntary voiding. In this review we give an overview of UI and the artificial urinary sphincter as a method of treatment. © 2007 Future Drugs Ltd.","collagen; silicone; zirconium; bladder neck; bladder sphincter prosthesis; device; health care system; human; incidence; lifestyle; micturition; nursing home patient; review; United States; urethra; urine incontinence; Child; Equipment Design; Humans; Postoperative Period; Urethra; Urinary Incontinence; Urinary Sphincter, Artificial"

NA,Endocrine disrupting chemicals and breast cancer: a systematic review of epidemiological studies,2021,NA,NA,"Background: Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) are ubiquitous substances that are found in our everyday lives, including pesticides, plasticizers, pharmaceutical agents, personal care products, and also in food products and food packaging. Increasing epidemiological evidence suggest that EDCs may affect the development or progression of breast cancer and consequently lead to lifelong harmful health consequences, especially when exposure occurs during early life in humans. Yet so far no appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic. Objective: To systematically review all the available epidemiological studies about the association of the levels of environmental exposures of EDCs with breast cancer risk. Methods: The search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved articles from PubMed (MEDLINE) until 10 March 2021. The key words used in this research were: “Endocrine disruptor(s)” OR “Endocrine disrupting chemical(s)” OR any of the EDCs mentioned below AND “Breast cancer” to locate all relevant articles published. We included only cohort studies and case-control studies. All relevant articles were accessed in full text and were evaluated and summarized in tables. Results: We identified 131 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. EDCs reviewed herein included pesticides (e.g. p,p’-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), atrazine, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin)), synthetic chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), parabens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contraceptive pills), phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein, resveratrol), and certain mycotoxins (e.g. zearalenone). Most studies assessed environmental EDCs exposure via biomarker measurements. Conclusion: We identified certain EDC exposures could potentially elevate the risk of breast cancer. As majority of EDCs are highly persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative, it is essential to assess the long-term impacts of EDC exposures, especially multi-generational and transgenerational. Also, since food is often a major route of exposure to EDCs, well-designed exposure assessments of potential EDCs in food and food packing are necessary and their potential link to breast cancer development need to be carefully evaluated for subsequent EDC policy making and regulations. © 2021 The Author(s).

For systems involving two components (i.e., A and B), the field-based Hamiltonian, Hf [W-, W+], depends on a composition field, W-(r), that controls the segregation of the unlike components and a pressure field, W+(r), that enforces incompressibility. This review introduces researchers to a promising variant of FTS, in which W-(r) fluctuates while W+(r) tracks its mean-field value. The method is described in detail for melts of AB diblock copolymer, covering its theoretical foundation through to its numerical implementation. We then illustrate its application for neat AB diblock copolymer melts, as well as ternary blends of AB diblock copolymer with its A- and B-type parent homopolymers. The review concludes by discussing the future outlook.

Furthermore, most endorectal coils create a susceptibility artifact detrimental to both anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) acquisitions. We aimed at assessing the safety and MRS performance of a susceptibility-matched endorectal coil for further rectal wall analysis. Experiments were performed on a General Electric MR750 3 T scanner. A variable number of miniaturized passive RF traps were incorporated in the reception cable. The assessment of RF heating and coil sensitivity was conducted on a 1.5% agar-agar phantom doped with NaCl. Several susceptibility-matched materials such as Ultem, perfluorocarbon and barium sulfate were then compared with an external coil. Finally, Ultem was used as a solid support for an endorectal coil and compared with a reference coil. Phantom experiments exhibited a complete suppression of both the RF heating phenomenon and the coil sensitivity artifact. Ultem was the material that produced the smallest image distortion. The full width at half maximum of MR spectra acquired using the susceptibility-matched endorectal coil showed at least 30% narrowing compared with a reference endorectal coil. A susceptibility-matched endorectal coil with RF traps incorporated was validated on phantoms. This coil appears to be a promising device for future in vivo experiments. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Algae; Barium sulfate; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Phantoms; Polysaccharides; Sodium chloride; Sulfur compounds; Coil sensitivity; General electrics; In-vivo experiments; Perfluorocarbons; Phantom experiment; Radio frequencies; Susceptibility artifacts; Variable number; Magnetic resonance imaging; absorption parameters; controlled study; device safety; feasibility study; heating; human; human tissue; magnetic field; magnetism; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; priority journal; radiofrequency; rectum; Review; temperature measurement; diagnostic imaging; imaging phantom; radiofrequency radiation; rectum; signal noise ratio; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Phantoms, Imaging; Radio Waves; Rectum; Signal-To-Noise Ratio"
