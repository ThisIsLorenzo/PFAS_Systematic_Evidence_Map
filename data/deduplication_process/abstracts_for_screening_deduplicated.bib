abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) used in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) comprise some perfluoroalkyl substances but a larger variety of polyfluoroalkyl substances. Despite their abundance in AFFF, information is lacking on the potential transformation of these polyfluoroalkyl substances. Due to the biological and chemical stability of the repeating perfluoroalkyl -(CF2)n- moiety common to all known AFFF-derived PFASs, it is not immediately evident whether the microbial biotransformation mechanisms observed for other organic contaminants also govern the microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances. Herein, we aim to: 1) review the literature on the aerobic or anaerobic microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances in environmental media; 2) compile and summarize proposed microbial biotransformation pathways for major classes of polyfluoroalkyl substances; 3) identify the dominant biotransformation intermediates and terminal biotransformation products; and 4) discuss these findings in the context of environmental monitoring and source allocation. This analysis revealed that much more is currently known about aerobic microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances, as compared to anaerobic biotransformation. Further, there are some similarities in microbial biotransformations of fluorotelomer and electrochemical fluorination-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, but differences may be largely due to head group composition. Dealkylation, oxidation, and hydrolytic reactions appear to be particularly important for microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, and these biotransformations may lead to formation of some semi-stable intermediates. Finally, this review discusses key knowledge gaps and opportunities for further research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid (HFPO-TA) is reported to have hepatotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and cytotoxicity. In this study, the toxicological effects of HFPO-TA on mitochondrial function and biogenesis were studied. Mice were exposed to drinking water which contained either 2, 20, or 200 μg/L HFPO-TA. Results showed exposure to HFPO-TA induced disadvantageous physiological changes in mice, including increases in liver weight, altered cell morphology, and inflammatory responses. Specifically, exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA increased mitochondria number, relative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, and mRNA levels of mitochondrial genes encoded by mtDNA. Significant increases in TFAM mRNA and protein levels were also observed. Liver metabolome analysis also showed exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA further enhanced increases in metabolites and altered metabolic pathways that correlated with mitochondrial function, especially the production of ATP. HFPO-TA exposure increased protein expression of mitochondrial complex I-V, and the activities of key enzymes involved in TCA cycle (α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase). Furthermore, exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA significantly up-regulating mRNA and protein levels of Opa1, Mfn1, Mfn2, Fis1, and Mff, but did not change Drp1. These findings suggest HFPO-TA could have detrimental effects on health of animals, particularly it was associated with disrupted mitochondrial energy metabolism. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Development of the Greater Bay area, China (GBA) has imposed significant pressures on ecosystems within the wider Pearl River Delta (PRD) system, including through inputs of contaminants from the GBA's rapidly expanding urban, industrial and agricultural activities. Here, we assess publication trends, sampling focus, and concentrations observed for a range of emerging contaminants (pharmaceutical and personal care products, pesticides, other endocrine disrupting chemicals, platinum group elements, and microplastics) in the GBA, via a systematic review of papers (n = 407) indexed in Science Direct, SpringerLink and Wiley Online databases. While emerging contaminants form the focus of increasing numbers of publications since 2006, they are understudied compared to more traditionally-measured contaminants (here, DDT and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs). BisphenolA was the most widely studied of the emerging contaminants (n = 41 studies) in the GBA, followed by macrolides (n = 32 studies). While multiple point measurements with high precision and low detection limits have been reported for various emerging contaminants, these have not been integrated for management purposes. A relatively high percentage of studies present data from single deployments (48% of studies, despite strong seasonality in the PRD system), data coverage is variable spatially, and reported contaminant concentrations vary significantly (over one to four orders of magnitude). We assess the currently published knowledge under the Source-Pathway-Receptor contaminant linkage model and use this to identify (a) current research emphasis in relation to assessment of contaminant risk, and (b) key knowledge gaps around sources, pathways and receptors in the GBA system. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Advanced technologies based on the use of non-equilibrium or non-thermal plasma had been recognized as a possible solution for, not only degradation, but for complete removal of recalcitrant organic micropollutants. While previous review papers have been focused on plasma physics and chemistry of different types of discharges for few organic micropollutants, this paper brings comprehensive review of current knowledge on the chemistry and degradation pathways by using different non-thermal plasma types for several micropollutants’ classes, such as pharmaceuticals, perfluorinated compounds, pesticides, phenols and dyes and points out some major research gaps. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the recent years, endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) has received increasing attention due to their significant toxic effects on human beings and wildlife by affecting their endocrine systems. As an important group of emerging pollutant, EDCs have been detected in various aquatic environments, including surface waters, groundwater, wastewater, runoff, and landfill leachates. Their removal from water resources has also been an emerging concern considering growing population as well as reducing access to fresh water resources. EDC removal from wastewaters is highly dependent on physicochemical properties of the given EDCs present in each wastewater types as well as various aquatic environments. Due to chemical, physical and physicochemical diversities in these parameters, variety of technologies consisting of physical, biological, electrochemical, and chemical processes have been developed for their removal. This review highlights that the effectiveness of EDC removal is highly dependent of selecting the appropriate technology; which decision is made upon a full wastewater chemical characterization. This review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective about all the current technologies used for EDCs removal from various aquatic matrices along with rising challenges such as the antimicrobial resistance gene transfer during EDC treatment. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been primarily attributed to contaminated food and drinking water. There is information indicating other sources and pathways of exposure in residential environments, but few studies report relationships between these indoor media and human biomonitoring measurements. Methods: This study adapts existing systematic review tools and methodologies to synthesize evidence for PFAS exposure pathways from indoor environment media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust. Studies were identified using innovative machine learning approaches and pathway-specific search strings to reduce time needed for literature search and screening. The included studies and systematic review were evaluated using tools modified specifically for exposure studies. The systematic review was conducted following a previously published protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) that describes the systematic review methodology used in detail. Results: Only 7 studies were identified that measured the targeted subset of 8 PFAS chemicals in concordant household media (primarily house dust) and participant serum. Data extracted from the included studies were used to calculate exposure intake rates and estimate a percentage of occupant serum concentrations that could be attributed to the indoor exposure pathways. These calculations showed that exposure to PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS from contaminated house dust could account for 13%, 3%, 7%, and 25% of serum concentrations, respectively. Inhalation of PFAS in indoor air could account for less than 4% of serum PFOA concentrations and less than 2% of serum PFOS and PFNA concentrations. A risk of bias was identified due to participant profiles in most of the studies being skewed towards white, female, and higher socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Along with synthesizing evidence for estimated contributions to serum PFAS levels from indoor exposure media, this systematic review also identifies a consistent risk of bias across exposure study populations that should be considered in future studies. It highlights a major research gap and need for studies that measure concordant data from both indoor exposure media and participant serum and the need for continued research on exposure modeling parameters for many PFAS chemicals. © 2022},

abstract={Objective: To summarize the application of non-targeted metabolomics in epidemiological studies that assessed metabolite and metabolic pathway alterations associated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure. Recent Findings: Eleven human studies published before April 1st, 2021 were identified through database searches (PubMed, Dimensions, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus), and citation chaining (Citationchaser). The sample sizes of these studies ranged from 40 to 965, involving children and adolescents (n = 3), non-pregnant adults (n = 5), or pregnant women (n = 3). High-resolution liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was the primary analytical platform to measure both PFAS and metabolome. PFAS were measured in either plasma (n = 6) or serum (n = 5), while metabolomic profiles were assessed using plasma (n = 6), serum (n = 4), or urine (n = 1). Four types of PFAS (perfluorooctane sulfonate (n = 11), perfluorooctanoic acid (n = 10), perfluorohexane sulfonate (n = 9), perfluorononanoic acid (n = 5)) and PFAS mixtures (n = 7) were the most studied. We found that alterations to tryptophan metabolism and the urea cycle were most reported PFAS-associated metabolomic signatures. Numerous lipid metabolites were also suggested to be associated with PFAS exposure, especially key metabolites in glycerophospholipid metabolism which is critical for biological membrane functions, and fatty acids and carnitines which are relevant to the energy supply pathway of fatty acid oxidation. Other important metabolome changes reported included the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle regarding energy generation, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism in cellular energy systems. Conclusions: There is growing interest in using non-targeted metabolomics to study the human physiological changes associated with PFAS exposure. Multiple PFAS were reported to be associated with alterations in amino acid and lipid metabolism, but these results are driven by one predominant type of pathway analysis thus require further confirmation. Standardizing research methods and reporting are recommended to facilitate result comparison. Future studies should consider potential differences in study methodology, use of prospective design, and influence from confounding bias and measurement errors. © 2022},

abstract={Hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid (HFPO-TA), an alternative to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), has been detected in various environmental and human matrices. However, information regarding its toxicity remains limited. Here, we established a three-dimensional (3D) primary mouse liver spheroid model to compare the hepatotoxicity of HFPO-TA and PFOA. The 3D spheroids were repeatedly exposed to 25-, 50-, or 100-μM HFPO-TA and PFOA for 28 d. Compared with the PFOA groups, the HFPO-TA groups showed higher bioaccumulation potential, higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, and lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP), albumin, and urea secretion. Transcriptome analysis identified 1603 and 772 differentially expressed genes in the 100-μM HFPO-TA- and PFOA-treated groups, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that cholesterol metabolism, bile acid metabolism, and inflammatory response were significantly altered. Exposure to 100-μM HFPO-TA increased triglyceride content but decreased total cholesterol content, while no changes were observed in the 100-μM PFOA-treated group. Total bile acids in the re-polarized 3D spheroids increased significantly after 100-μM HFPO-TA and PFOA treatment, which did not affect bile acid synthesis but inhibited the expression levels of Bsep and Mrp2 related to bile acid transport. Thus, HFPO-TA exhibited more serious hepatotoxicity than PFOA in 3D primary liver spheroids and may not be a safe alternative. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of fluorinated aliphatic compounds considered as emerging persistent pollutants. Owing to their adverse effects on human health and environment, efficient methods of their removal from various complex matrices need to be developed. This review focuses on recent results addressing the adsorption of PFAS on activated carbons (AC) and metal-organic frameworks (MOF). While the former are well-established adsorbents used in water treatment, the latter are relatively new and still not applied at a large scale. Nevertheless, they attract research interests owing to their developed porosity and versatile surface chemistry. While AC provide high volumes of pores and hydrophobic surfaces to strongly attract fluorinated chains, MOF supply sites for acid-base complexation and a variety of specific interactions. The modifications of AC are focused on the introduction of basicity to attract PFAS anions via electrostatic/chemical interactions, and those of MOF - on structural defects to increase the pore sizes. Based on the comparison of the performance and specifically adsorption forces provided by these two groups of materials, activated carbons were pointed out as worthy of further research efforts. This is because their surface, especially that in large pores, where dispersive forces are week and where extensive pore space might be utilized to adsorb more PFAS, can be further chemically modified and these modifications might be informed by the mechanisms of PFAS adsorption, which are specific for MOF. This review emphasizes the effects of these modifications on the adsorption mechanism and brings the critical assessment of the advantages/disadvantages of both groups as PFAS adsorbents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

This scoping review aims to summarize known or possible associations between ADHD and environmental exposures to substances selected as priority chemicals of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU). Literature searches were performed in PubMed to identify relevant publications. Only meta-analyses and review articles were included, as they provide more extensive evidence compared to individual studies. The collected evidence indicated that lead (Pb), phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) are moderately to highly associated with ADHD. Limited evidence exists for an association between ADHD and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), flame retardants, mercury (Hg), and pesticides. The evidence of association between ADHD and cadmium (Cd) and per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) based on the identified reviews was low but justified further research. The methods of the individual studies included in the reviews and meta-analyses covered in the current paper varied considerably. Making precise conclusions in terms of the strength of evidence on association between certain chemicals and ADHD was not straightforward. More research is needed for stronger evidence of associations or the lack of an association between specific chemical exposures and ADHD. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are a large family of widely used synthetic chemicals that are environmentally and biologically persistent and present in most individuals. Chronic PFAS exposure have been linked to increased prostate cancer risk in occupational settings, however, underlying mechanisms have not been interrogated. Herein we examined exposure of normal human prostate stem-progenitor cells (SPCs) to 10 nM PFOA or PFOS using serial passage of prostasphere cultures. Exposure to either PFAS for 3–4 weeks increased spheroid numbers and size indicative of elevated stem cell self-renewal and progenitor cell proliferation. Transcriptome analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) showed 1) SPC expression of PPARs and RXRs able to mediate PFAS effects, 2) the emergence of a new cell cluster of aberrantly differentiated luminal progenitor cells upon PFOS/PFOA exposure, and 3) enrichment of cancer-associated signaling pathways. Metabolomic analysis of PFAS-exposed prostaspheres revealed increased glycolytic pathways including the Warburg effect as well as strong enrichment of serine and glycine metabolism which may promote a pre-malignant SPC fate. Finally, growth of in vivo xenografts of tumorigenic RWPE-2 human prostate cells, shown to contain cancer stem-like cells, was markedly enhanced by daily PFOS feeding to nude mice hosts. Together, these findings are the first to identify human prostate SPCs as direct PFAS targets with resultant reprogrammed transcriptomes and metabolomes that augment a preneoplastic state and may contribute to an elevated prostate cancer risk with chronic exposures. © 2021},

abstract={Background: Existing evidence suggests that perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exposure might contribute to the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis to identify the association between PFAS and the risk of GDM. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for appropriate articles about the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of GDM before September 28, 2020. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized by Stata 16.0 through fixed effect models according to heterogeneity. We also carried out subgroup analyses by geographic location, blood sampling time of subjects, method of chemical analysis, study design, sample size, and sampling year. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the robustness of the results. Results: A total of eight studies involving 5654 pregnant women were included in the meta-analysis. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was positively and significantly associated with the risk of GDM (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02–1.59). Exposure to other types of PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of GDM with the pooled effect estimates of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86–1.09), 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86–1.24), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55–1.16) respectively. Conclusion: We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and GDM and found that PFOA concentration was significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of GDM in public health. Further studies are needed in order to establish causality and clarify the potential mechanism. © 2021},

abstract={The accelerated urbanization and industrialization worldwide has increased the pollution via toxic chemicals, thus generating environmental hazards to public health and ecosystems. As a consequence, the national authorities and scientists are paying more attention to the development and implementation of viable cost-effective detoxification solutions. Biochar has emerged as a biomass-derived material that can be produced through a variety of feedstocks and carbonization techniques. Distinct characteristics of biochar can be appropriate, cost-effective, and eco-friendly for removing a wide spectrum of inorganic and organic pollutants. This review aims to emphasize the crucial function of biochar-based materials in the abatement of toxic emerging pollutants. It covers the synthesis and applications of engineered biochars by discussing extensive research and knowledge in this area. The relationships of biochar properties with feedstock, synthesis conditions, technologies and modification methods have also been discussed. Biochars with different surface functionalities (e.g., COO−, Fe-O, etc.,) can be obtained by either varying the feedstock material (lignocellulosic or non-lignocellulosic) or by modifying it with different chemicals (e.g., metal ions, rare earth elements, surfactants) including the preparation of composites. The interaction mechanisms between biochar and various pollutants are reviewed and analyzed. The type of interactions (e.g., electrostatic, π-π stacking, hydrogen bonding) depends on the different surface functionalities of biochar. This review also illustrates that biochar and its related composites have shown remarkable properties and versatility for their effective application in adsorption, photocatalysis and oxidation processes in aqueous phase. Finally, prospective research directions and opportunity areas for biochar research are also discussed. The article provides a comprehensive review on the production, modification and environmental application of engineered biochar. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Emerging pollutants (EPs) create a worldwide concern owing to their low concentration and severe toxicity to the receptors. The prominent emerging pollutants categories as pharmaceutical and personal care product, plasticizer, surfactants, and persistent organic pollutants. Typically, EPs are widely disseminated in the aquatic ecosystem and capable of perturbing the physiology of water bodies as well as humans. The primary sources of EPs in the environment include anthropogenic release, atmospheric deposition, untreated or substandard treated wastewater, and extreme weather events. Intensive research has been done covering the environmental distribution, ecological disturbance, fate, and removal of EPs in the past decades. However, a systematic review on the distribution of EPs in the engineered and natural aquatic environment and the degradation of different EPs by using anaerobic sludge, aerobic bacteria, and isolated strains are limited. This review article aims to highlight the importance, application, and future perceptions of using different microbes to degrade EPs. Overall, this review article illustrates the superiority of using non-cultivable and cultivable microbes to degrade the EPs as an eco-friendly approach. Practically, the outcomes of this review paper will build up the knowledge base solutions to remove EPs from the wastewater. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of fluorinated organic compounds of anthropogenic origin. Due to their unique chemical properties, widespread production, environmental distribution, long-term persistence, bioaccumulative potential, and associated risks for human health, PFAS have been classified as persistent organic pollutants of significant concern. Scientific evidence from the last several decades suggests that their widespread occurrence in the environment correlates with adverse effects on human health and ecology. The presence of PFAS in the aquatic environment demonstrates a close link between the anthroposphere and the hydrological cycle, and concentrations of PFAS in surface and groundwater range in value along the ng L−1–μg L−1 scale. Here, we critically reviewed the research published in the last decade on the global occurrence and distribution of PFAS in the aquatic environment. Ours is the first paper to critically evaluate the occurrence of PFAS at the continental scale and the evolving global regulatory responses to manage and mitigate the adverse human health risks posed by PFAS. The review reports that PFAS are widespread despite being phased out—they have been detected in different continents irrespective of the level of industrial development. Their occurrence far from the potential sources suggests that long-range atmospheric transport is an important pathway of PFAS distribution. Recently, several studies have investigated the health impacts of PFAS exposure—they have been detected in biota, drinking water, food, air, and human serum. In response to the emerging information about PFAS toxicity, several countries have provided administrative guidelines for PFAS in water, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Germany, and Australia. In the US, additional regulatory measures are under consideration. Further, many PFAS have now been listed as persistent organic pollutants. This comprehensive review provides crucial baseline information on the global occurrence, distribution, and regulatory framework of PFAS. © 2021},

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent chemicals and have been detected throughout the environment. Thermal treatment is the most common remediation approach for PFAS-contaminated solid wastes. Although various thermal treatment techniques have demonstrated the potential to destruct PFAS, the fate of PFAS, removal efficacy, potential emissions, and the formation of incomplete combustion products during thermal treatment are little known. This study provides a critical review on the behavior of PFAS based on different types of thermal treatment technologies with various PFAS-impacted environmental medias that include water, soil, sewage sludge, pure PFAS materials, and other PFAS-containing wastes. Different extents of PFAS thermal destruction are observed across various thermal treatment techniques and operating conditions. PFAS removal and destruction efficiencies rely heavily on PFAS structures, the complex combustion chemistry, the presence or absence of oxygen, temperature, and other operational conditions. This review also covers proposed PFAS thermal destruction mechanisms. Different thermal destruction mechanisms for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and other PFAS are reviewed and compared. The majority of studies about PFAS thermal destruction mechanisms were focused on a specific list of PFAS and based mostly on the pyrolysis treatment. The basic pathway for PFAS destruction during pyrolysis is hydrodefluorination, which could be largely influenced by the alkaline condition. Future field-scale research that involves the characterization of PFAS destruction products and incomplete combustion products is needed to address public concerns and better emission control.},

abstract={To tackle membrane fouling and limited removals of pollutants (nutrients and emerging pollutants) that hinder the wide applications of membrane bioreactor (MBR), attached growth MBR (AGMBR) combining MBR and attached growth process has been developed. This review comprehensively presents the up-to-date developments of media used in both aerobic and anaerobic AGMBRs for treating wastewaters containing conventional and emerging pollutants. It also elaborates the properties of different media, characteristics of attached biomass, and their contributions to AGMBR performance. Conventional media, such as biological activated carbon and polymeric carriers, induce formation of aerobic, anoxic and/or anaerobic microenvironment, increase specific surface area or porous space for biomass retention, improve microbial activities, and enrich diverse microorganisms, thereby enhancing pollutants removal. Meanwhile, new media (i.e. biochar, bioaugmented carriers with selected strain/mixed cultures) do not only eliminate conventional pollutants (i.e. high concentration of nitrogen, etc.), but also effectively remove emerging pollutants (i.e. micropollutants, nonylphenol, adsorbable organic halogens, etc.) by forming thick and dense biofilm, creating anoxic/anaerobic microenvironments inside the media, enriching special functional microorganisms and increasing activity of microorganisms. Additionally, media can improve sludge characteristics (i.e. less extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products, larger floc size, better sludge settleability, etc.), alleviating membrane fouling. Future studies need to focus on the development and applications of more new functional media in removing wider spectrum of emerging pollutants and enhancing biogas generation, as well as scale-up of lab-scale AGMBRs to pilot or full-scale AGMBRs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

However, investigations into the contamination of ARGs in mining areas have been scarce. Here, the types, abundances, and influencing factors of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were investigated in soil/sediment of the Dexing copper mine area in June 2019 by using high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (HT-qPCR). Furthermore, the influence of heavy metals and MGEs factors on ARGs was studied using the multivariate statistical analysis method. The results showed that there were a variety of ARGs in the Dexing copper mining area, and the maximum detected number of ARGs was 70. At the relative abundance level, the relative abundance of individual sites reached 0.085. In the Dexing copper mine, multidrug, MLSB, β-lactamases, tetracycline, and aminoglycoside resistance genes were the dominant ARG classes based on their numbers. The efflux pump was the most dominant resistance mechanism, followed by antibiotic deactivation and cellular protection. There was a significant positive correlation between the abundance of ARGs and MGEs (P<0.05), and TnpA04 and Inti1 were the most important MEGs in Dexing copper mine samples, indicating that horizontal gene transfer might be an important mechanism for the spread of environmental ARGs. The results of Pearson correlation analysis and RDA analysis showed that the content of Cu was significantly positively correlated with the detected numbers and abundance of ARGs (P<0.05), suggesting that the high content of Cu in the Dexing copper mining area might be an important driving factor for the formation of ARGs. © 2022, Science Press.

abstract={Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), one of the well-known perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), has been widespread in the environment and associated with male reproductive toxicity. However, the molecular mechanism involved in low-level PFOA-induced male endocrine disruption remains to be elucidated. In this study, we performed a combined proteomics and metabolomics analysis to investigate the proteomic and metabolic alterations in MLTC-1 Leydig cells responsive to low levels of PFOA exposure. The results showed that PFOA significantly regulated the expressions of 67 proteins and 17 metabolites, among which 18 proteins and 7 metabolites were specifically tied to lipid and fatty acid metabolism as well as testicular steroidogenesis. It is further suggested that low-dose PFOA stimulates steroid hormone synthesis by accelerating fatty acid metabolism and steroidogenic process, which is involved in the repression of p38 and cAMP-dependent ERK signaling pathway. The animal studies also revealed that environmentally relevant levels of PFOA increased serum steroid hormone levels accompanied by the activated cAMP and inhibited p38/ERK pathway in testis, which confirmed our in vitro findings. Overall, the present study will provide novel insights into the toxicological mechanisms of low-level PFOA-mediated steroidogenic disturbance, and may implicate the reproductive health risk of humans with environmental PFOA exposure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={As human beings have been consistently exposed to bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol S (BPS) derived from various products, the intake of BPS/BPA to humans has been extensively studied. However, using conventional biological matrices such as urine, blood, or dissected skin to detect BPS/BPA in the human body system requires longer exposure time to them, hardly defines the pollutant source of the accumulated BPS/BPA, and is often invasive. Herein, our new approach i.e. fingerprint analysis quantitatively confirms the transfer of BPS/BPA from receipts (specific pollution source) to human skin only within receipt-handling of “20 s”. When receipts (fingertip region size; ~1 cm2) containing 100–300 μg of BPS or BPA are handled, 20–40 μg fingerprint-1 of BPS or BPA is transferred to human skin (fingertip). This transferred amount of BPS/BPA can still be toxic according to the toxicity test using water fleas. As a visual evidence, a fingerprint map that matches the distribution of the absorbed BPS/BPA is developed using a mass spectrometry imaging tool. This is the first study to analyze fingerprints to determine the incorporation mechanism of emerging pollutants. This study provides an efficient and non-invasive environmental forensic tool to analyze amounts and sources of hazardous substances. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Patent foramen ovale (PFO) describes a valve in the interatrial septum that permits shunting of blood or thrombotic material between the atria. PFOs are present in approximately 25% of the healthy population and are not associated with any pathology in the vast majority of cases. However, comparisons between patients with stroke and healthy controls suggest that PFOs may be causative of stroke in certain patients whose stroke is otherwise cryptogenic. Options for the diagnosis of PFO include transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. PFOs associated with an interatrial septal aneurysm seem to be more strongly linked to risk of recurrent stroke. Therapeutic options for secondary stroke prevention in the setting of a PFO include antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and percutaneous device closure. Recent randomized clinical trials suggest that percutaneous closure reduces the subsequent risk of stroke in appropriately selected patients, with a large relative benefit but small absolute benefit. Referral for percutaneous PFO closure should therefore be considered in certain patients after a multidisciplinary, patient centered discussion. Areas for future study include structural biomarkers to aid in determining the role of PFO closure in older people with possible PFO associated stroke, the role of direct oral anticoagulants, and very long term outcomes after device closure. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

abstract={Emerging evidence has shown that cell-cell interactions between testicular cells, in par-ticular at the Sertoli cell-cell and Sertoli-germ cell interface, are crucial to support spermatogenesis. The unique ultrastructures that support cell-cell interactions in the testis are the basal ES (ectoplas-mic specialization) and the apical ES. The basal ES is found between adjacent Sertoli cells near the basement membrane that also constitute the blood-testis barrier (BTB). The apical ES is restrictively expressed at the Sertoli-spermatid contact site in the apical (adluminal) compartment of the sem-iniferous epithelium. These ultrastructures are present in both rodent and human testes, but the majority of studies found in the literature were done in rodent testes. As such, our discussion herein, unless otherwise specified, is focused on studies in testes of adult rats. Studies have shown that the testicular cell-cell interactions crucial to support spermatogenesis are mediated through distinctive signaling proteins and pathways, most notably involving FAK, Akt1/2 and Cdc42 GTPase. Thus, manipulation of some of these signaling proteins, such as FAK, through the use of phosphomimetic mutants for overexpression in Sertoli cell epithelium in vitro or in the testis in vivo, making FAK either constitutively active or inactive, we can modify the outcome of spermatogenesis. For instance, using the toxicant-induced Sertoli cell or testis injury in rats as study models, we can either block or rescue toxicant-induced infertility through overexpression of p-FAK-Y397 or p-FAK-Y407 (and their mutants), including the use of specific activator(s) of the involved signaling proteins against pAkt1/2. These findings thus illustrate that a potential therapeutic approach can be developed to manage toxicant-induced male reproductive dysfunction. In this review, we critically evaluate these recent findings, highlighting the direction for future investigations by bringing the laboratory-based research through a translation path to clinical investigations. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Over the last years, research has focused on microbiota to establish a missing link between neuronal health and intestine imbalance. Many studies have considered microbiota as critical regulators of the gut–brain axis. The crosstalk between microbiota and the central nervous system is mainly explained through three different pathways: the neural, endocrine, and immune pathways, intricately interconnected with each other. In day-to-day life, human beings are exposed to a wide variety of contaminants that affect our intestinal microbiota and alter the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, causing neuronal disorders. The interplay between xenobiotics, microbiota and neurotoxicity is still not fully explored, especially for susceptible populations such as pregnant women, neonates, and developing children. Precisely, early exposure to contaminants can trigger neurodevelopmental toxicity and long-term diseases. There is growing but limited research on the specific mechanisms of the microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA), making it challenging to understand the effect of environmental pollutants. In this review, we discuss the biological interplay between microbiota–gut–brain and analyse the role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals: Bisphenol A (BPA), Chlorpyrifos (CPF), Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in MGBA perturbations and subsequent neurotoxicity. The complexity of the MGBA and the changing nature of the gut microbiota pose significant challenges for future research. However, emerging in-silico models able to analyse and interpret meta-omics data are a promising option for understanding the processes in this axis and can help prevent neurotoxicity. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Thyroid hormone homeostasis is essential for normal brain development in fetuses and infants. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to organochlorine (β coefficient, −0.022; 95% CI, −0.04 to −0.003) and PFAS (β coefficient, −0.017; 95% CI, −0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to organochlorine and PFAS may be associated with lower neonatal TT4 level. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={The development of novel materials and their application as adsorbents to improve water quality is one of the branches of materials science that has advanced significantly in the last decade. Due to the contamination of water resources with antibiotic residues, and the concern to contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance, scientists have tapped into agricultural and industrial wastes in order to transform them into new functional adsorbents that allow the adsorption of these pollutants. This review aims to summarize the different types of adsorptive materials that can be prepared using these residues and their application for removing antibiotics. From the reviewed literature, the adsorbents were classified as raw materials, surface-modified adsorbents, waste-based composites, carbon-based materials, and other adsorbents like zeolite, nano-hydroxyapatite, nano-cellulase, nano-silica, among others. Biochar and hydrochar are two of the most studied carbonaceous materials, with adsorption capacities ranging from 10 to 944 mg/g. Other leading adsorbents from the same family include mesoporous carbons, hierarchical and heteroatoms-doped porous carbons, and bio graphene, with surface area and adsorption performance over 1000 m2/g and 500 mg/g, respectively. The most outstanding material prepared from waste was zeolite analcime, produced from electrolytic manganese residue, removing 1922 mg/g for roxithromycin. In addition, new methodologies or combined methods to produce these adsorbents, including new modifier agents (ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents), templating, self-templating, doping techniques, and thermo-chemical approaches were reviewed for the first time. Furthermore, particular emphasis was given to photocatalyst-loaded adsorbents due to their synergistic effect of adsorption and degradation of antibiotics. Finally, novel methodologies to regenerate saturated adsorbents were discussed, such as UV radiation-assisted regeneration and ultrasound. © 2021},

abstract={Anthropogenic imprints have become a fundamental part of most ecosystems. Our chemical footprint is often detected using targeted approaches, whereas xenobiotics are embedded within the large pool of dissolved metabolites, altered by biotic and abiotic mechanisms. Thus, it is necessary to simultaneously study anthropogenic signals entwined with the variety of organic signatures that exist in aquatic environments. However, methods for non-targeted analysis of natural metabolites are not always well suited for the analysis of pollutants. Here, we report the reassessment of styrene-divinylbenzene polymer-based Priority PolLutant (PPL) solid-phase extraction (PPL-SPE), which is typically used to extract marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) for biogeochemical studies, to analyze a set of xenobiotics commonly observed in coastal North Pacific seawater. After PPL extraction and analysis by nontargeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), we successfully detected 23 out of 25 selected pharmaceuticals, personal care products, biocides, perfluorocarbons, and polymer additives in a complex marine DOM sample using positive and negative electrospray ionization. We tested two pH conditions to mimic typical marine DOM extraction studies and found mean recovery rates of xenobiotics were approximately 10% higher in seawater pH (pH ~ 8) than in acidified samples (pH ~ 2) for both negative and positive modes, although overall, mean recovery rates were 10% lower in negative mode. Our results indicate that PPL-SPE in combination with non-targeted LC–MS/MS is capable of capturing the tested set of xenobiotics, thus allowing the repurposing of biogeochemical sampling strategies as well as existing DOM samples and MS data for the subsequent assessment of anthropogenic impacts in marine environments. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Global production of shellfish aquaculture is steadily increasing owing to the growing market demands for shellfish. The intensification of shellfish aquaculture to maximize production rate has led to increased generation of aquaculture waste streams, particularly the effluents and shellfish wastes. If not effectively managed, these wastes could pose serious threats to human health and the ecosystem while compromising the overall sustainability of the industry. The present work comprehensively reviews the source, composition, and environmental implications of shellfish wastes and aquaculture wastewater. Moreover, recent advancements in the valorization of shellfish wastes into value-added biochar via emerging thermochemical and modification techniques are scrutinized. The utilization of the produced biochar in removing emerging pollutants from aquaculture wastewater is also discussed. It was revealed that shellfish waste-derived biochar exhibits relatively higher adsorption capacities (300–1500 mg/g) compared to lignocellulose biochar (<200 mg/g). The shellfish waste-derived biochar can be effectively employed for the removal of various contaminants such as antibiotics, heavy metals, and excessive nutrients from aquaculture wastewater. Finally, future research priorities and challenges faced to improve the sustainability of the shellfish aquaculture industry to effectively support global food security are elaborated. This review envisages that future studies should focus on the biorefinery concept to extract more useful compounds (e.g., carotenoid, chitin) from shellfish wastes for promoting environmental-friendly aquaculture. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, the comparative profiles of metabolites in three-dimensional (3D) human normal liver (L-02) cell spheroids with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) treatment were analyzed using a metabolomic approach. The uniform 3D cell spheroids were well formed in 3 days (e.g., sphericity index >0.9) and stably maintained over the subsequent 11 days. The cytotoxicity of PFOA to the 3D L-02 cell spheroids was highly dependent on both exposure concentration and duration. Comparative analysis of metabolomes showed that the number of differential metabolites in the 3D cell spheroids treated with 300 μM PFOA for 10 days (n = 59) was greater than those with a 4-day exposure to 300 μM PFOA (n = 17). Six metabolic pathways related to amino acids metabolism were only found in the 3D cell spheroids with a 10-day treatment of 300 μM PFOA, which could not be found in the 2D monolayer cells and those 3D cell spheroids with a 4-day exposure. The suppression of PFOA on glutamine metabolism substantially decreased glutathione (GSH) production and accordingly increased the level of reactive oxygen species in the 3D cell spheroids. On the contrary, the supplementation of glutamine increased GSH production and the viability of cell spheroids, indicating that glutamine metabolism played a critical role in the chronic toxic effects of PFOA. Our study strongly suggested that comprehensive toxicological methodologies based on the 3D cell models could currently be robust and suitable for addressing the chronic adverse effects of toxic contaminants. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The presence of conventional and emerging pollutants infiltrating into our water bodies is a course of concern as they have seriously threatened water security. Established techniques such as photocatalysis and membrane technology have proven to be promising in removing various persistent organic pollutants (POP) from wastewaters. The emergence of hybrid photocatalytic membrane which incorporates both photocatalysis and membrane technology has shown greater potential in treating POP laden wastewater based on their synergistic effects. This article provides an in-depth review on the roles of both photocatalysis and membrane technology in hybrid photocatalytic membranes for the treatment of POP containing wastewaters. A concise introduction on POP’s in terms of examples, their origins and their effect on a multitude of organisms are critically reviewed. The fundamentals of photocatalytic mechanism, current directions in photocatalyst design and their employment to treat POP’s are also discussed. Finally, the challenges and future direction in this field are presented. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background: As an age-related syndrome, frailty may play a central role in poor health among older adults. Sarcopenia overlaps with the physical domain of frailty, and most existing studies have analyzed the associated factors of frailty and sarcopenia as an isolated state. Perturbations in metabolism may play an important role in the presence of frailty or sarcopenia; however, the metabolites associated with frailty, especially overlapping with sarcopenia remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore whether amino acids, carnitines, acylcarnitines and lysophosphatidylcholines, as specific panels, are significantly correlated with frailty, especially overlapping with sarcopenia, to gain insight into potential biomarkers and possible biological mechanisms and to facilitate their management. Methods: We applied a targeted high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach in serum samples from 246 Chinese older men (age 79.2 ± 7.8 years) with frailty (n = 150), non-frailty (n = 96), frailty and sarcopenia (n = 52), non-frail and non-sarcopenic control (n = 85). Frailty was evaluated using Freid phenotype criteria, sarcopenia was defined by diagnostic algorithm of Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia, and the participants were diagnosed as frailty and sarcopenia when they met the evaluation criteria of both frailty and sarcopenia. A panel of 29 metabolomic profiles was assayed and included different classes of amino acids, carnitines, acylcarnitines, and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). Multivariate logistic regression was used to screen the metabolic factors contributing to frailty status, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis was used to explore important factors and distinguish different groups. Results: In older men demonstrating the frail phenotype, amino acid perturbations included lower tryptophan and higher glycine levels. With regard to lipid metabolism, the frailty phenotype was characterized by lower concentrations of isovalerylcarnitine (C5), LPC16:0 and LPC18:2, while higher levels of octanoyl-L-carnitine (C8), decanoyl-L-carnitine (C10), dodecanoyl-L-carnitine (C12) and tetradecanoyl-L-carnitine (C14). After adjusting for several clinical confounders, tryptophan, LPC18:2, LPC 16:0 and C5 were negatively correlated with frailty, and C8 and C12 were positively related to frailty. We preliminarily identified metabolic profiles (LPC16:0, LPC18:2, glycine and tryptophan) that may distinguish older men with frailty from those without frailty. Importantly, a set of serum amino acids and LPCs (LPC16:0, LPC18:2, and tryptophan) was characterized in the metabotype of older adults with an overlap of frailty and sarcopenia. The metabolites that were most discriminating of frailty status implied that the underlying mechanism might be involved in antioxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusions: These present metabolic analyses may provide valuable information on the potential biomarkers and possible biological mechanisms of frailty, and overlapping sarcopenia. The findings obtained may offer insight into their management in older adults. Copyright © 2022 Meng, Shi, Wang, Shi, Wu, Dang, Fan, Shen, Yu, Dong, Yang and Xi.},

abstract={The microbial transformation potential of 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) was explored in anaerobic microbial systems. Microbial communities from anaerobic wastewater sludge, an anaerobic digester, and anaerobic dechlorinating cultures enriched from aquifer materials reductively dechlorinated 6:2 Cl-PFESA to 6:2 hydrogen-substituted polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (6:2 H-PFESA), which was identified as the sole metabolite by non-target analysis. Rapid and complete reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was achieved by the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures. The microbial community of the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures was impacted by 6:2 Cl-PFESA exposure. Organohalide-respiring bacteria originally present in the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures, including Geobacter, Dehalobacter, and Dehalococcoides, decreased in relative abundance over time. As the relative abundance of organohalide-respiring bacteria decreased, the rates of 6:2 Cl-PFESA dechlorination decreased, suggesting that the most likely mechanism for reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was co-metabolism rather than organohalide respiration. Reductive defluorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was not observed. Furthermore, 6:2 H-PFESA exhibited 5.5 times lower sorption affinity to the suspended biosolids than 6:2 Cl-PFESA, with the prospect of increased mobility in the environment. These results show the susceptibility of 6:2 Cl-PFESA to microbially mediated reductive dechlorination and the likely persistence of the product, 6:2 H-PFESA, in anaerobic environments. © 2022 American Chemical Society},

abstract={Efforts are being made to tune the reactivity of the tetraoxy anion of iron in the +6 oxidation state (FeVIO42–), commonly called ferrate, to further enhance its applications in various environmental fields. This review critically examines the strategies to generate highly reactive high-valent iron intermediates, FeVO43– (FeV) and FeIVO44– or FeIVO32– (FeIV) species, from FeVIO42–, for the treatment of polluted water with greater efficiency. Approaches to produce FeV and FeIV species from FeVIO42– include additions of acid (e.g., HCl), metal ions (e.g., Fe(III)), and reductants (R). Details on applying various inorganic reductants (R) to generate FeV and FeIV from FeVIO42– via initial single electron-transfer (SET) and oxygen-atom transfer (OAT) to oxidize recalcitrant pollutants are presented. The common constituents of urine (e.g., carbonate, ammonia, and creatinine) and different solids (e.g., silica and hydrochar) were found to accelerate the oxidation of pharmaceuticals by FeVIO42–, with potential mechanisms provided. The challenges of providing direct evidence of the formation of FeV/FeIV species are discussed. Kinetic modeling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide opportunities to distinguish between the two intermediates (i.e., FeIV and FeV) in order to enhance oxidation reactions utilizing FeVIO42–. Further mechanistic elucidation of activated ferrate systems is vital to achieve high efficiency in oxidizing emerging pollutants in various aqueous streams. © 2021 American Chemical Society},

abstract={Increasing chemical pollution of aquatic environments is a growing concern with global relevance. A large number of organic chemicals are termed as “micropollutants” due to their low concentrations, and long-term exposure to micropollutants may pose considerable risks to aquatic organisms and human health. In recent decades, numerous treatment methods and technologies have been proposed to remove micropollutants in water, and typically several micropollutants were chosen as target pollutants to evaluate removal efficiencies. However, it is often unclear whether their toxicity and occurrence levels and frequencies enable them to contribute significantly to the overall chemical pollution in global aquatic environments. This review intends to answer an important lingering question: Which micropollutants or class of micropollutants deserve more attention globally and should be removed with higher priority? Different risk-based prioritization approaches were used to address this question. The risk quotient (RQ) method was found to be a feasible approach to prioritize micropollutants in a large scale due to its relatively simple assessment procedure and extensive use. A total of 83 prioritization case studies using the RQ method in the past decade were compiled, and 473 compounds that were selected by screening 3466 compounds of three broad classes (pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, and industrial chemicals) were found to have risks (RQ > 0.01). To determine the micropollutants of global importance, we propose an overall risk surrogate, that is, the weighted average risk quotient (WARQ). The WARQ integrates the risk intensity and frequency of micropollutants in global aquatic environments to achieve a more comprehensive priority determination. Through metadata analysis, we recommend a ranked list of 53 micropollutants, including 36 PPCPs (e.g., sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen), seven pesticides (e.g., heptachlor and diazinon), and 10 industrial chemicals (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid and 4-nonylphenol) for risk management and remediation efforts. One caveat is that the ranked list of global importance does not consider transformation products of micropollutants (including disinfection byproducts) and new forms of pollutants (including antibiotic resistance genes and microplastics), and this list of global importance may not be directly applicable to a specific region or country. Also, it needs mentioning that there might be no best answer toward this question, and hopefully this review can act as a small step toward a better answer. © 2021 American Chemical Society},

abstract={Introduction and hypothesis: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are helpful instruments when measuring and reporting changes in patient health status (Al Sayah et al. J Patient Rep Outcomes 5 (Suppl 2):99, 2021) such as the health-related quality of life (HrQoL) of women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The Australasian Pelvic Floor Procedure Registry (APFPR) aims to increase capacity for women to report surgical outcomes through the collection of HrQoL data (Ruseckaite et al. Qual Life Res. 2021) but currently lacks a pain-specific PROM for women with pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), particularly POP and SUI. This review aims to systematically review the existing literature and identify instruments that measure pain in women with POP and SUI for inclusion within the APFPR, which reports on complications from these conditions. Methods: We conducted a literature search on OVID MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EMCARE databases in addition to Google Scholar and grey literature to identify studies from inception to April 2021. Full-text studies were included if they used PROMs to measure pain in women with POP and SUI. Two authors independently screened articles, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Results: From 2001 studies, 23 publications describing 19 different PROMs were included for analysis. Eight of these instruments were specific to the pelvic floor; four were only specific to pain and used across multiple disorders; three were generic quality of life instruments and four were other non-validated instruments such as focus group interviews. These instruments were not specific to pain in women with POP or SUI, as they did not identify all relevant domains such as the sensation, region and duration of pain, or incidents where onset of pain occurs. Conclusions: The findings of this review suggest there are no current PROMs that are suitable pain-specific instruments for women with POP or SUI. This knowledge may inform and assist in the development of a new PROM to be implemented into the APFPR. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Perfluoropolyethers (PFPE) is a kind of high performance synthetic lubricant with low volatility, high thermal and oxidation stability, good chemical inertia and insulation performance, as well as a wide range of liquid temperature and excellent viscosity-temperature characteristics. PFPE has been widely used in aerospace, military, nuclear industry, computer disk and other fields. With the rapid development of industrial technology, new requirements have been proposed for the performance of the lubricants. As a result, the common perfluoropolyethers as lubricants gradually cannot work well under the present working conditions. Moreover, it is difficult to improve the lubrication performance of perfluoropolyethers by conventional additives technology due to their poor compatibility with conventional additives. Hence, in order to improve the antifriction and antiwear properties of perfluoropolyethers, researchers focused on modifying their structures. Great efforts have been paid to improve the performance of perfluoropolyethers as lubrication film in the field of computer disk, but as a kind of important aviation lubricating oils, their lubrication performances are also in urgent need of improvement. In this context, in this study three kinds of perfluoropolyether carboxylate ammonium ionic liquids (PF-BA, PF-DBA and PF-TBA) were designed and synthesized by modifying the structure of perfluoropolyether carboxylic acid (PFPEC) with different amines. The structures of synthesized ionic liquids were confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. Their shear stress and viscosity at different shear rates were evaluated by a Rheometer, and the wetting ability on metal surfaces were analyzed by the contact angle. Their lubrication performance for steel/steel and steel/tin bronze friction pairs at 25 ℃ and 100 ℃ were evaluated and compared by Optimal SRV-V oscillating friction and wear tester, where PFPE and PFPEC were used as reference samples. And the variation of the tribofilm during the friction process were revealed by the change of contact resistance. The surface morphologies and element state were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. Tribochemical reactions were investigated by comparing the change in surface morphologies and element state of wear spot. By combining the above results, the lubrication mechanism was explored. Results showed that all the synthesized ionic liquids exhibited higher shear stress and viscosity than PFPEC. Specifically, the ionic liquids with more N-H bonds in the cation exhibited higher viscosity and shear stress, possibly due to the formation of hydrogen bond that can increase the intermolecular interactions. The viscosity and shear stress gradually decreased with the increase of shear rate, while the viscosity of the ionic liquids with more N-H bond in the cation decreased more rapidly. On the surface of tin bronze, the three ionic liquids exhibited better wetting performance than PFPEC, but poorer than PFPE. While on the steel surface, the three ionic liquids exhibited better wetting abilities than PFPEC and PFPE. As lubricants for steel/tin bronze friction pairs, the friction coefficients and wear volumes of the three ionic liquids were close to those of PFPE and PFPEC at room temperature, and their lubrication performance was improved insignificantly. The synthesized ionic liquids exhibited much better anti-friction and anti-wear performance at high temperature (100 ℃) than PFPE and PFPEC. As lubricants for steel/steel friction pairs at room temperature, the friction coefficients of the three ionic liquids were similar to that of PFPEC, and even a little higher than PFPE; while the wear volumes decreased about 60%-70% in comparison with PFPE and PFPEC. At 100 ℃, compared with PFPE and PFPEC, the friction coefficients of the three ionic liquids were much more stable and lower, and the wear volumes were reduced by 70% ~ 80%. Summarily, three synthesized ionic liquids had better friction-reduction and anti-wear properties than that of PFPE and PFPEC both at room temperature and at high temperature as lubricants for steel/steel friction pair. The contact resistances reflected the variation of the tribofilm, i.e. the higher contact resistance, the thicker tribofilm and better lubricating properties. The results of tested contact resistances were consistent with the friction tests results. According to the SEM morphologies of the worn surface lubricated by different lubricants, both the tin bronze and steel worn surfaces exhibited abrasive wear. Among them, the worn surfaces lubricated by ionic liquids PF-TBA were the smoother, and the parallel grooves were the shallower both at room temperature and high temperature. The steel worn surfaces lubricated by the three ionic liquids were much smoother than that of PEPE and PEPEC. From the XPS results, it can be seen that the composition and content of the friction films on the worn surface lubricated by the three synthesized ionic liquids were different from that of PEPEC. The tribofilm formed on the steel surfaces lubricated by the ionic liquids was consisted of Fe3O4, Fe2O3 and FeF3, the nitrogen-containing compounds and adsorbed ionic liquids. The adsorption film of the ionic liquids on the metal surface was strong and the tribofilm was thick. The combined results of multiple physical and chemical analysis showed that the excellent friction-reduction and anti-wear properties of synthesized ionic liquids can be attributed to their excellent adsorption properties on the metal surface and the formation of stable tribofilm.

These plastic particles absorb toxic organic pollutants on their surface, support bacterial biofilms growth, and propagate through the food chain, posing serious risks for human health. Therefore, nano/microplastics pollution has become a global issue, making their definitive elimination compulsory. Self-propelled nano/microrobots have demonstrated efficient removal of nano/microplastics from water, combining enhanced physicochemical properties of nano/microscale materials and active motion. During the last year, the potential of this technology to degrade nano/microplastics has been investigated. Here, the most advanced strategies for nano/microplastics capture and subsequent degradation by autonomous nano/microrobots are critically reviewed. A short introduction to the main propulsion mechanisms and experimental techniques for studying nano/microplastics degradation is also provided. Forthcoming challenges in this research field are discussed proactively.

abstract={Perfluorochemicals are widely found in the environment due to their versatile uses and persistent nature. Perfluorochemicals have also been detected in human and animals due to direct or indirect exposures, giving rise to health concerns. This review aims to examine the bioremediation of perfluorochemicals with plants, bacteria and fungi, including their efficiency and limitations. It also aims to propose the future prospects of bioremediation of perfluorochemicals. This review retrieved peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2010 and 2021 from journal databases consisting of Web of Science, Scopus and ScienceDirect. This review shows that multiple Pseudomonas species could degrade perfluorochemicals particularly perfluoroalkyl acids under aerobic condition. Acidimicrobium sp. degraded perfluoroalkyl acids anaerobically in the presence of electron donors. A mixed Pseudomonas culture was more effective than pure cultures. Multiple plants were found to bioconcentrate perfluorochemicals and many demonstrated the ability to hyperaccumulate perfluoroalkyl acids, particularly Festuca rubra, Salix nigra and Betula nigra. Fungal species, particularly Pseudeurotium sp. and Geomyces sp., have the potential to degrade perfluorooctanoic acid or perfluorooctane sulphonic acid. Perfluorochemicals bioremediation could be advanced with identification of more candidate species for bioremediation, optimization of bioremediation conditions, mixed culturing, experiments with environmental media and studies on the biochemical pathways of biotransformation. This review provides comprehensive insight into the efficiency of different bacterial, plant and fungal species in perfluorochemicals bioremediation under different conditions, their limitations and improvement. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={A fungal strain (FJII-L10-SW-P1) was isolated from the Mars 2020 spacecraft assembly facility and exhibited biofilm formation on spacecraft-qualified Teflon surfaces. The reconstruction of a six-loci gene tree (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1 and RPB2, and TEF1) using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses of the strain FJII-L10-SW-P1 supported a close relationship to other known Parengyodontium album subclade 3 isolates while being phylogenetically distinct from subclade 1 strains. The zig-zag rachides morphology of the conidiogenous cells and spindle-shaped conidia were the distinct morphological characteristics of the P. album subclade 3 strains. The MLST data and morphological analysis supported the conclusion that the P. album subclade 3 strains could be classified as a new species of the genus Parengyodontium and placed in the family Cordycipitaceae. The name Parengyodontium torokii sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate the strain, with FJII-L10-SW-P1 as the holotype. The genome of the FJII-L10-SW-P1 strain was sequenced, annotated, and the secondary metabolite clusters were identified. Genes predicted to be responsible for biofilm formation and adhesion to surfaces were identified. Homology-based assignment of gene ontologies to the predicted proteome of P. torokii revealed the presence of gene clusters responsible for synthesizing several metabolic compounds, including a cytochalasin that was also verified using traditional metabolomic analysis. © 2022 by the authors.

In metabolome analysis, 9512 low-mass ions (LMIs) were identified—7 LMIs were abundant in all lumbar versus paired ventricular CSF samples, and 3 LMIs were significantly abundant in all ventricular CSF. In comparisons between spinal LM (+) CSF and LM (−) CSF, 105 LMIs were discriminative for spinal LM (+) CSF. In proteome analysis, a total of 1536 proteins were measured. A total of 18 proteins, including complement C3, were more highly expressed in all lumbar CSF, compared with paired ventricular CSF, while 82 proteins, including coagulation factor V, were higher in the ventricular CSF. Of 37 discriminative proteins, including uteroglobin and complement component C8 gamma chain, 4 were higher in all spinal LM (+) CSF versus spinal LM (−) CSF. We further evaluated metabolic pathways associated with these discriminative proteins using the Gene Ontology database. We found that 16/17 spinal LM (+) pathways, including complement activation, were associated with lumbar discriminative proteins, whereas only 2 pathways were associated with ventricular-discriminative proteins. In conclusion, we determined that metabolite and protein profiles differed between paired lumbar and ventricular CSF samples. The protein profiles of spinal LM (+) CSF showed more similarity with the lumbar CSF than the ventricular CSF. Thus, we suggest that CSF LMIs and proteins could reflect LM disease activity and that LM-associated differences in CSF are more likely to be present in the lumbar compartment. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={In recent years, ion electrolyte membranes (IEMs) preparation and properties have attracted fabulous attention in fuel cell usages owing to its high ionic conductivity and chemical resistance. Currently, perfluorinatedsulfonicacid (PFSA) membrane has been widely employed in the membrane industry in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs); however, Nafion™ suffers reduced proton conductivity at a higher temperature, requiring noble metal catalyst (Pt, Ru, and Pt-Ru), and catalyst poisoning by CO. Non-fluorinated polymers are a promising substitute. Polysulfone (PSU) is an aromatic polymer with excellent characteristics that have attracted membrane scientists in recent years. The present review provides an up-to-date development of PSU based electrolyte membranes and its composites for PEMFCs, alkaline membrane fuel cells (AMFCs), and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) application. Various fillers encapsulated in the PEM/AEM moiety are appraised according to their preliminary characteristics and their plausible outcome on PEMFC/DMFC/AMFC. The key issues associated with enhancing the ionic conductivity and chemical stability have been elucidated as well. Furthermore, this review addresses the current tasks, and forthcoming directions are briefly summarized of PEM/AEMs for PEMFCs, DMFCs, AMFCs. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={The main factor restricting lead isotope analysis of metals from museum collections is the requirement for physical material. Hence, there are major incentives for developing minimally invasive methods for lead isotope analysis that are accurate and precise enough to reveal historical information about artefacts and their origin. Portable laser ablation (pLA), collecting microscopic samples on Teflon filters, has four key benefits. It produces no visual impact to the artefacts, does not require transport of artefacts to laboratory facilities, there are no artefact size restrictions, and samples are processed under clean laboratory conditions allowing Pb purification prior to measurement by solution MC-ICPMS. To validate the efficacy of the pLA technique on silver, nine matrixed-matched commercial, in-house and archaeological reference materials were sampled and analysed multiple times (9-10). The pLA mean analyses (±2SD) were all consistent with inter-laboratory bulk analyses. The digestion of sample filters produces precisions that are consistently more than five-times better than in situ nsLA-MC-ICPMS and are the same order of magnitude expected for bulk samples processed in different laboratories.

In this study, the extraction reaction of Pd(II) in chloride media using of N, N, N’, N’, N”, N”-hexaoctyl-nitrilotriacetamide (NTAamide(C8)) as a novel extractant has been demonstrated. Three diluents with high dielectric constants (acetophenone (AP), 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), and 1-octanol (OC)) were used for the solvent extraction reaction. The slope analysis indicated that the anion exchange extraction reaction of Pd(II) was consistent with an approximately 2:1 stoichiometry for the NTAamide(C8)/AP and NTAamide(C8)/DCE systems, and 1:1 for NTAamide(C8)/OC. Moreover, the ED behavior of the extracted Pd(II) complex was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Palladium reduction was found to be an irreversible process based on analysis of the standard rate constant. A semi-integral analysis of the voltammogram determined the diffusion coefficients of the extracted Pd(II) complex in the AP, DCE, and OC systems to be 3.7 ± 0.1 × 10−10, 2.8 ± 0.1 × 10−10 and 1.5 ± 0.2 × 10−10 m2 s−1, respectively. Furthermore, consecutive extraction-electrodeposition processes using the NTAamide(C8)/AP system were carried out for five cycles. High extraction percentage (E &gt; 91%) and current efficiency (ε &gt; 83.1%) were attained in all cycles. The electrodeposits recovered from the extraction-electrodeposition process were identified as Pd metal through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS), ubiquitously present in the environment and biota, are transferred to the fetus via the placenta. PFAS can be distinguished, among other things, by their different carbon chain lengths and functional groups. The aim of this study was to provide comprehensive evidence on PFAS transfer rates across the human placental barrier by means of a meta-analysis based upon a systematic review. The available literature up to April 2021 was reviewed and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) of PFAS assessed. A total of 39 studies reporting data on 20 PFAS were included in the systematic review. Of these, 20 studies with data on 19 compounds were included in the meta-analysis. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA v3.0) was used for quantitative, statistical analyses with random effects models. A curvilinear relationship was found with short and long chains of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) exhibiting higher TTE than compounds with intermediate chain length. Among the less well studied PFAS, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), 6:2 fluorotelomersulfonic acid (6:2 FTS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) stood out the most with a high TEEs. The dependence of TTEs on chain length and functional group is clearly shown in this first meta-analysis on PFAS transfer across the human placenta. More data on effects of less well studied PFAS in pregnant women and neonates are needed to assess the potential risk for fetal exposure. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) substances are a group of anthropogenic organic chemicals. PFAS have numerous applications in the industrial and commercial fields. They have become abundant in the environment and have been detected in the blood of humans and animals. PFAS exposure likely increases the risk of certain diseases. In recent years, there has been a steep rise in related primary and secondary articles. Objectives: We aim to collate narrative and systematic reviews including both qualitative and quantitative synthesis on biological, environmental, or medical aspects of PFAS exposure and burdens, and to create an evidence review map to fulfil three main objectives. 1) Mappingto reveal what evidence on PFAS has been systematically reviewed and where synthesis may be needed. 2) Bibliometrics: to characterise the interdisciplinarity, independence and connectedness of the reviews. 3) Critical appraisal: to assess the included reviews for the reliability of conclusions and methodological transparency. This overview of reviews will inform future research and policy making. Search and study eligibility: We will perform a systematic search on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and the ‘grey literature’. To be included in the map, a study must be a review from the systematic review family and focus on at least one of predefined 31 PFAS. We will limit inclusions to peer-reviewed publications, pre-prints, and theses without any language restrictions. At least two authors will scan title, abstract and keywords, followed by full-text screening of included reviews. Critical appraisal of reviews and synthesis methods: We will assess each review of the systematic review family referencing the AMSTAR2 checklist. We will collect information on conflict-of-interest statements, funding sources and availability of raw data and analysis code. We will extract relevant data from full texts and bibliographic records, conduct bibliometric analyses, and display findings as tables, figures and a narrative synopsis. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Prenatal exposures to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been linked to reduced fetal growth. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study aims to investigate biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers underlying the association between serum PFAS and fetal growth using high-resolution metabolomics in a cohort of pregnant African American women in the Atlanta area, Georgia. Methods: Serum perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measurements and untargeted serum metabolomics profiling were conducted in 313 pregnant African American women at 8–14 weeks gestation. Multiple linear regression models were applied to assess the associations of PFAS with birth weight and small-for-gestational age (SGA) birth. A high-resolution metabolomics workflow including metabolome-wide association study, pathway enrichment analysis, and chemical annotation and confirmation with a meet-in-the-middle approach was performed to characterize the biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers of the PFAS-fetal growth relationship. Results: Each log2-unit increase in serum PFNA concentration was significantly associated with higher odds of SGA birth (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.07, 1.63); similar but borderline significant associations were found in PFOA (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.94, 1.49) with SGA. Among 25,516 metabolic features extracted from the serum samples, we successfully annotated and confirmed 10 overlapping metabolites associated with both PFAS and fetal growth endpoints, including glycine, taurine, uric acid, ferulic acid, 2-hexyl-3-phenyl-2-propenal, unsaturated fatty acid C18:1, androgenic hormone conjugate, parent bile acid, and bile acid-glycine conjugate. Also, we identified 21 overlapping metabolic pathways from pathway enrichment analyses. These overlapping metabolites and pathways were closely related to amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism perturbations. Conclusion: In this cohort of pregnant African American women, higher serum concentrations of PFOA and PFNA were associated with reduced fetal growth. Perturbations of biological pathways involved in amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism were associated with PFAS exposures and reduced fetal growth, and uric acid was shown to be a potential intermediate biomarker. Our results provide opportunities for future studies to develop early detection and intervention for PFAS-induced fetal growth restriction. © 2021},

We search two databases (PubMed and Embase) through July/09/2021 and identified 33 studies reporting associations with prenatal organochlorine exposure, 21 studies reporting associations with prenatal PFAS, and five studies reporting associations with prenatal PBDEs. We conducted a qualitative review. Additionally, we performed random-effects meta-analyses of POP exposures, with data estimates from at least three prospective studies, and BMI-z. Prenatal DDE and HCB levels were associated with higher BMI z-score in childhood (beta: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.21; I2: 28.1% per study-specific log increase of DDE and beta: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.53; I2: 31.9% per study-specific log increase of HCB). No significant associations between PCB-153, PFOA, PFOS, or pentaPBDEs with childhood BMI were found in meta-analyses.

abstract={Background &amp; Aims: Patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) present a systemic hyperinflammatory response associated with increased circulating levels of small-molecule metabolites. To investigate whether these alterations reflect inadequate cell energy output, we assessed mitochondrial morphology and central metabolic pathways with emphasis on the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in peripheral leukocytes from patients with acutely decompensated (AD) cirrhosis, with and without ACLF. Methods: The study included samples from patients with AD cirrhosis (108 without and 128 with ACLF) and 41 healthy individuals. Leukocyte mitochondrial ultrastructure was visualized by transmission electron microscopy and cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolic fluxes were determined by assessing NADH/FADH2 production from various substrates. Plasma GDF15 and FGF21 were determined by Luminex and acylcarnitines by LC-MS/MS. Gene expression was analyzed by RNA-sequencing and PCR-based glucose metabolism profiler array. Results: Mitochondrial ultrastructure in patients with advanced cirrhosis was distinguished by cristae rarefication and swelling. The number of mitochondria per leukocyte was higher in patients, accompanied by a reduction in their size. Increased FGF21 and C6:0- and C8:0-carnitine predicted mortality whereas GDF15 strongly correlated with a gene set signature related to leukocyte activation. Metabolic flux analyses revealed increased energy production in mononuclear leukocytes from patients with preferential involvement of extra-mitochondrial pathways, supported by upregulated expression of genes encoding enzymes of the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways. In patients with ACLF, mitochondrial function analysis uncovered break-points in the TCA cycle at the isocitrate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase level, which were bridged by anaplerotic reactions involving glutaminolysis and nucleoside metabolism. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence at the cellular, organelle and biochemical levels that severe mitochondrial dysfunction governs immunometabolism in leukocytes from patients with AD cirrhosis and ACLF. Lay summary: Patients at advanced stages of liver disease have dismal prognosis due to vital organ failures and the lack of treatment options. In this study, we report that the functioning of mitochondria, which are known as the cell powerhouse, is severely impaired in leukocytes of these patients, probably as a consequence of intense inflammation. Mitochondrial dysfunction is therefore a hallmark of advanced liver disease. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Humans are exposed to an ever-increasing number of environmental toxicants, some of which have gradually been elucidated to be important risk factors for metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. These metabolism-sensitive diseases typically occur when key metabolic and signaling pathways were disrupted, which can be influenced by the exposure to contaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), along with genetic and lifestyle factors. This promotes the concept and research on environmental metabolism disrupting chemicals (MDCs). In addition, identifying endogenous biochemical markers of effect linked to disease states is becoming an important tool to screen the biological targets following environmental contaminant exposure, as well as to provide an overview of toxicity risk assessment. As such, the current review aims to contribute to the further understanding of exposome and human health and disease by characterizing environmental exposure and effect metabolic biomarkers. We summarized MDC-associated metabolic biomarkers in laboratory animal and human cohort studies using high throughput targeted and nontargeted metabolomics techniques. Contaminants including heavy metals and organohalogen compounds, especially EDCs, have been repetitively associated with metabolic disorders, whereas emerging contaminants such as perfluoroalkyl substances and microplastics have also been found to disrupt metabolism. In addition, we found major limitations in the effective identification of metabolic biomarkers especially in human studies, toxicological research on the mixed effect of environmental exposure has also been insufficient compared to the research on single chemicals. Thus, it is timely to call for research efforts dedicated to the study of combined effect and metabolic alterations for the better assessment of exposomic toxicology and health risks. Moreover, advanced computational and prediction tools, further validation of metabolic biomarkers, as well as systematic and integrative investigations are also needed in order to reliably identify novel biomarkers and elucidate toxicity mechanisms, and to further utilize exposome and metabolome profiling in public health and safety management. © 2021},

The major sources of PFAS to the environment are categorized under direct and indirect sources. The characteristic compounds and concentrations are summarized as found from direct sources such as manufacturing facilities, aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) applications, metal coating operations, and textile and paper coating operations; and from indirect sources such as landfills and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The major findings are: 1) among the aqueous matrices for which data were reviewed, groundwater impacted by AFFF contamination showed the highest median concentrations for both perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), while the second-highest median concentrations were associated with landfill leachates for PFOA and metal-plating sources for PFOS; 2) many of the unknown polyfluorinated precursors present in AFFF-impacted sites could potentially convert to persistent PFAS by abiotic or biotic transformation, and therefore could act as the long-term source of contamination to the environment; 3) part per billion (ppb) concentrations of PFAS were detected in water bodies surrounding fluorochemical manufacturing plants; 4) in consumer products such as textile, paper, and personal care products, PFOA concentrations were an order of magnitude higher compared to other PFAS; 5) biotransformation products such as fluorotelomer carboxylic acids (FTCAs) and perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are detected in landfill leachates and WWTP effluents; and 6) many studies have shown increased PFAA concentrations in WWTP effluents compared to influents.

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are artificial persistent organic pollutants ubiquitous in ecosystem, and their bioaccumulation and adverse outcomes in plants have attracted extensive concerns. Here, we review the toxic effects of PFASs encountered by various plants from physiological, biochemical and molecular perspectives. The exposure routes and bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites are also summarized. The bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites varied between ng/g and μg/g levels. The 50% inhibition concentration of PFASs for plant growth is often several orders of magnitude higher than the environmentally relevant concentrations (ERCs). ERCs of PFASs rarely lead to obvious phenotypic/physiological damages in plants, but markedly perturb some biological activities at biochemical and molecular scales. PFAS exposure induces the over-generated reactive oxygen species and further damages plant cell structure and organelle functions. A number of biochemical activities in plant cells are perturbed, such as photosynthesis, gene expression, protein synthesis, carbon and nitrogen metabolisms. To restore the desire states of cells exposed to PFASs, plants initiate several detoxifying mechanisms, including enzymatic antioxidants, non-enzymatic antioxidants, metallothionein genes and metabolic reprogramming. Future challenges and opportunities in PFAS phytotoxicity studies are also proposed in the review. © 2021 The Author(s)},

In this comprehensive worldwide review, we collected ecotoxicology and concentration data observed in surface water for 53 high-potency EDs and performed a risk assessment. The compounds were selected from the EU watchlist of priority substances, expanded with new compounds of emerging concern (total 41), where quantifiable data were available for the past three years (2018–2020). The risk quotients ranged from <0.01 for 22 substances to 1974 for tamoxifen. The frequency of samples in which the predicted no-effect concentrations were exceeded also varied, from 1.8% to 92.7%. By using the comprehensive multi-parameter risk assessment in our study, the most current to date, we determined that tamoxifen, imidacloprid, clothianidin, four bisphenols (BPA, BPF, BPS, and BPAF), PFOA, amoxicillin, and three steroid hormones (estriol, estrone, and cyproterone) pose significant risks in the environment. Comparing two structurally very similar bisphenols, BPA and BPB, suggested that the risk from BPB is currently underestimated by at least four orders of magnitude due to the lack of ecotoxicological data availability. The methodological limitations encountered suggest that a standardized methodology for data selection and assessment is necessary, highlighting the fact that some substances are currently under-represented in the field of ecotoxicological research. A new prioritization system is therefore presented, which provides a potential basis for new substances to be included in environmental monitoring lists. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Partial denitrification granular sludge (PDGS) and denitrification granular sludge (DGS) play an important role in nitrogen removal from wastewater. However, the inherent cause of aggregation capacity related to the ratio of COD to nitrogen (COD/N) is still unclear. In this study, metabolomics analysis was combined with microbiological analyses, granular performance and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) structure to explore the granulation mechanism at different influent COD/N ratios. The results showed that the higher COD/N ratio selectively enhanced the gluconeogenesis pathway, purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathway, resulting in more extracellular polysaccharide (PS) excretion and floc sludge. The absence of carbon source weakened tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) reaction, resulting in NAD+ and ADP decrease, nitrite accumulation and change of microbial community structure. The amino acids biosynthesis pathway was enhanced under low COD/N ratio, which promoted the hydrophobicity of EPS. PDGS had stronger Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs)-based quorum sensing (QS) than DGS during the operational period. CO8-HSL, C8-HSL and C6-HSL, as the main form of AHLs, played a dominating role in DGS and PDGS. Batch tests illustrated that adding AHLs obviously improved the synthesis of the amino acids, threonine (Thr), tryptophan (Trp), methionine (Met) and glycine (Gly). Dosing AHLs regulated PS synthesis only at a high COD/N ratio. The glucose-6P, glycerate-3p and UDP-Glc were up-regulated only in DSG, which increased the hydrophilic groups in EPS. The results not only provided the new insights into the metabolism of denitrifying granular sludge, but also indicated the application potential of the technologies regarding start-up and operation of granule sludge. © 2021},

However, there is a lack of data regarding EDC exposures in humans living in Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines. Hence, this study measured levels of 41 EDCs in women residing in the Greater Manila Area, home to the second largest city in Southeast Asia. Urine samples from women with versus without breast cancer were analyzed for 11 phthalate metabolites, 8 environmental phenols, and 10 bisphenols, while serum samples were analyzed for 12 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Out of the four groups of EDCs analyzed, PFAS were significantly associated with breast cancer (adjusted OR = 13.63, 95% CI: 3.24–94.88 p-trend = 0.001 for PFDoA; adjusted OR = 9.26, 95% CI 2.54–45.10, p-trend = 0.002 for PFDA; and adjusted OR = 2.66, 95% CI: 0.95–7.66, p-trend = 0.004 for PFHxA). Long-chain PFAS levels were positively correlated with age and were significantly higher in women from Region IV-A, a heavily industrialized region, than from the National Capital Region. Overall, this study showed baseline information regarding the level of EDCs in Filipinas, providing a glimpse of EDC exposure in women living in a megalopolis city in Southeast Asia. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Introduction: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a compound used as an industrial surfactant in chemical processes worldwide. Population and cross-sectional studies have demonstrated positive correlations between PFOA levels and human health problems. Objectives: Many studies have focused on the hepatotoxicity and liver problems caused by PFOA, with little attention to remediation of these problems. As an antioxidant, vitamin C is frequently utilized as a supplement for hepatic detoxification. Methods: In this study, we use a mouse model to study the possible role of vitamin C in reducing PFOA-induced liver damage. Based on comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of vitamin C. Results: Our results show that vitamin C supplementation reduces signs of PFOA-induced liver damage including total cholesterol and triglyceride levels increase, liver damage markers aspartate, transaminase, and alanine aminotransferase elevation, and liver enlargement. Further, we show that the protective role of vitamin C is associated with signaling networks control, suppressing linoleic acid metabolism, reducing thiodiglycolic acid, and elevating glutathione in the liver. Conclusion: The findings in this study demonstrate, for the first time, the utility of vitamin C for preventing PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity. © 2021},

abstract={Due to chemical and physiological inertness and wide usage in nearly every aspect of our daily life, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are now ubiquitous in the environment, including drinking water sources. As most biological and chemical destruction methods have so far shown limited efficiencies, adsorption, a simple and cost-effective treatment, is widely adopted for the removal of PFAS from water/wastewater. This paper aims to review the recent progress in PFAS adsorption using various adsorbents. The performance of different types of adsorbents, including the traditional carbonaceous materials and resins as well as the newly-synthesized minerals, biomaterials, and polymers, in PFAS removal was summarized. Furthermore, the adsorption characteristics and mechanisms were critically reviewed. Real-life adsorption applications (large-scale setups, adsorption-involved treatment trains and point-of-use/point-of-entry systems) were also examined. Learned lessons, current challenges and recommendations on future research were provided regarding results of tests in real environmental matrices, pilot and/or field scale studies of promising newly-developed adsorbents, and the improvement of the removal of alternative PFAS (mostly short-chained ones). © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={As an emerging pollutant, microplastics (MPs, plastic particles with size < 5 mm) pollution in water has acquired extensive attention in recent years due to their small particle size and stable properties, which can act as a carrier for pollutants in water environment and have toxic hazards to aquatic organisms. After entering into water environment, MPs are readily undergone varied types of weathering processes (i.e., hydrolysis, photo oxidation, mechanical abrasion, and biodegradation), leading to shifted surface morphology (i.e., surface roughness, specific surface area, and size) and physicochemical properties (i.e., melting temperature, surface charge, molecular weight, crystallinity, and hydrophobicity). Among different weathering processes of MPs in water, sunlight induced photo aging process has been considered as primary contributor, which will further impact the MPs behaviors, such as aggregation and deposition in water column, adsorption to organic and inorganic pollutants, leaching of additives, as well as toxicity to organisms in water. From the perspective of MPs aging mechanism, photo aging process of MPs in water environment is a free radical associated chain reaction process and readily to be affected by polymer types, plastic additives, halogen ions, and natural organic matters. These components are generally photochemical activated and prone to involved in the direct or free radical associated indirect photo aging process processed. However, limited information has referred the impact of plastic additives and water constitutes on the long term weathering process for MPs in water, which will pose a great difference between laboratoryaccelerated weathering and long-term natural weathering. Studying the photo aging mechanism of MPs in water environment is of great significance for evaluating their formation process and potential ecological risks. Based on the above considerations, we systematically reviewed the photo aging and fragmentation processes of MPs in water environment. The content of this work contains: (1) Photo aging mechanism and changes of MPs physicochemical properties during aging process in water. Research results revealed that photo aging process could affect the molecular arrangement and mechanical properties of MPs, and further fragment into smaller size secondary MPs even in nano-scale particles, which is important to explain the formation of MPs in current water environment. (2) Critical effect of plastic properties, such as polymer type, size, and plastic additives on the aging of MPs in water; for the impact of plastic additives on the aging process of MPs, results in this work suggested that photo aging mechanism of MPs could be modified due to the presence of plastic additive (i.e., antioxidant and colorant). (3) Role of water constitutes (i.e., Cl-, Br, and NOM) on the photo aging process of MPs in water. The results emphasized the multiple impacts of water constitutes (halogen ions and natural organic matter) in the photo aging process of MPs in the water environment, illustrating that MPs may have different aging time and mechanisms in different water matrices. Moreover, impact of microorganism induced biodegradation for MPs in water is also proposed. In further study, more concentration should be concerned on the combined effects of plastic additives and water quality conditions on the aging process of MPs, which is helpful to shorten the distance between laboratory accelerated weathering and long-term aging process of MPs in natural waters. Besides, results of this paper can also provide theoretical support for comprehensively and systematically assessing the environmental behavior, toxicological effects and ecological risks of aged MPs in natural water environment. © 2021, Science Press.

Despite this, public information regarding their hepatotoxicity remains limited. Here, to compare the hepatotoxicity of PFECAs and identify better alternatives for GenX, adult male mice were exposed to different concentrations (0.4, 2, and 10 mg/kg/d) of PFOA, GenX, and its analogs (PFMO2HpA and PFMO3NA) for 28 d. Results demonstrated increased hepatomegaly and disturbed fatty acid metabolism with increasing treatment doses. After dimensionality reduction analysis, significant differences were observed in the relative liver weights and liver and serum biochemical parameters among the four clusters. Furthermore, when chemical concentrations in the liver were similar, no differences in the indicators of liver injury associated with fatty acid metabolism were observed among groups in the same clusters. Our results suggest that dimensionality reduction analysis is a useful strategy for analyzing samples exposed to multiple compounds at different doses. Furthermore, PFECAs exhibit similar hepatotoxicities at the same cumulative hepatic concentration in mice with constant body weight, while PFMO2HpA exhibits lower hepatotoxicity compared to GenX at the same dose. © 2021},

abstract={Antibiotic proliferation in the environment and their persistent nature is an issue of global concern as they induce antibiotic resistance threatening both human health and the ecosystem. Antibiotics have therefore been categorized as emerging pollutants. Fluoroquinolone (FQs) antibiotics are an emerging class of contaminants that are used extensively in human and veterinary medicine. The recalcitrant nature of fluoroquinolones has led to their presence in wastewater, effluents and water bodies. Even at a low concentration, FQs can stimulate antibacterial resistance. The main sources of FQ contamination include waste from pharmaceutical manufacturing industries, hospitals and households that ultimately reaches the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The conventional WWTPs are unable to completely remove FQs due to their chemical stability. Therefore, the development and implementation of more efficient, economical, convenient treatment and removal technologies are needed to adequately address the issue. This review provides an overview of the technologies available for the removal of fluoroquinolone antibiotics from wastewater including adsorptive removal, advanced oxidation processes, removal using non-carbon based nanomaterials, microbial degradation and enzymatic degradation. Each treatment technology is discussed on its merits and limitations and a comparative view is presented on the choice of an advanced treatment process for future studies and implementation. A discussion on the commercialization potential and eco-friendliness of each technology is also included in the review. The importance of metabolite identification and their residual toxicity determination has been emphasized. The last section of the review provides an overview of the policy interventions and regulatory frameworks that aid in retrofitting antibiotics as a central key focus contaminant and thereby defining the discharge limits for antibiotics and establishing safe manufacturing practices. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is causing a significant health burden among the European population. Current knowledge supports the notion that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) interfere with human metabolism and hormonal balance, contributing to the conventionally recognized lifestyle-related MetS risk factors. This review aims to identify epidemiological studies focusing on the association between MetS or its individual components (e.g., obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension) and eight HBM4EU priority substances (bisphenol A (BPA), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides and heavy metals (cadmium, arsenic and mercury)). Thus far, human biomonitoring (HBM) studies have presented evidence supporting the role of EDC exposures on the development of individual MetS components. The strength of the association varies between the components and EDCs. Current evidence on metabolic disturbances and EDCs is still limited and heterogeneous, and mainly represent studies from North America and Asia, highlighting the need for well-conducted and harmonized HBM programmes among the European population. Rigorous and ongoing HBM in combination with health monitoring can help to identify the most concerning EDC exposures, to guide future risk assessment and policy actions. © 2021 by the authors.

In children, several chemicals are under investigation, most commonly bisphenol A, phthalates, perfluorinated alkyl substances, and persistent organic pollutants, including organochlorinated pesticides, tributyltin, polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins. Several associations have been studied between chemical exposure in utero and postnatally. Current opinion among researchers indicates that the obesogen theory is very likely; however, limited published studies show inconsistent support for the obesogenic effects of most substances in children and are limited by difficulty in providing the exact mechanisms of action, nor is their mutual effect in humans known, let alone in children. Existing data indicate that we have only scratched the surface and have much more to learn about obesogens.

abstract={The incidence of many hormone-dependent diseases, including testicular cancer, has sharply increased in all high-income countries during the 20th century. This is not fully explained by established risk factors. Concurrent, increasing exposure to antiandrogenic environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in fetal life may partially explain this trend. This systematic review assessed available evidence regarding the association between environmental EDC exposure and risk of testicular cancer (seminomas and nonseminomas). Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of English peer-reviewed literature published prior to December 14, 2020 in the databases PubMed and Embase® was performed. Among the 279 identified records, 19 were eligible for quality assessment and 10 for further meta-analysis. The completeness of reporting was high across papers, but over 50% were considered subject to potential risk of bias. Mean age at diagnosis was 31.9 years. None considered effects of EDC multipollutant mixtures. The meta-analyses showed that maternal exposure to combined EDCs was associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer in male offspring [summary risk ratios: 2.16, (95% CI:1.78-2.62), 1.93 (95% CI:1.49-2.48), and 2.78 (95% CI:2.27-3.41) for all, seminoma, and nonseminoma, respectively]. Similarly, high maternal exposures to grouped organochlorines and organohalogens were associated with higher risk of seminoma and nonseminoma in the offspring. Summary estimates related to postnatal adult male EDC exposures were inconsistent. Maternal, but not postnatal adult male, EDC exposures were consistently associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer, particularly risk of nonseminomas. However, the quality of studies was mixed, and considering the fields complexity, more prospective studies of prenatal EDC multipollutant mixture exposures and testicular cancer are needed. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

abstract={Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are highly persistent synthetic organic contaminants that can cause serious human health concerns such as obesity, liver damage, kidney cancer, hypertension, immunotoxicity and other human health issues. Integrated crop–livestock systems combine agricultural crop production with milk and/or meat production and processing. Key sources of PFAS in these systems include firefighting foams near military bases, wastewater sludge and industrial discharge. Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances regularly move from soils to nearby surface water and/or groundwater because of their high mobility and persistence. Irrigating crops or managing livestock for milk and meat production using adjacent waters can be detrimental to human health. The presence of PFAS in both groundwater and milk have been reported in dairy production states (e.g., Wisconsin and New Mexico) across the United States. Although there is a limit of 70 parts per trillion of PFAS in drinking water by the U.S. EPA, there are not yet regional screening guidelines for conducting risk assessments of livestock watering as well as the soil and plant matrix. This systematic review includes (i) the sources, impacts and challenges of PFAS in integrated crop–livestock systems, (ii) safety measures and protocols for sampling soil, water and plants for determining PFAS concentration in exposed integrated crop–livestock systems and (iii) the assessment, measurement and evaluation of human health risks related to PFAS exposure. © 2021 by the authors.

Several serious diseases that decrease patient quality of life and increase mortality (high blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes etc.) are associated with obesity. Obesity treatment is a multidisciplinary and complex process that requires maximum patient compliance. Change of lifestyle is fundamental in the treatment of obesity. While pharmacotherapeutic options are available, their efficacy is limited. Surgical treatment though highly effective, carries the risk of complications and is thus indicated mostly in advanced stages of obesity. Endoscopic treatments of obesity are less invasive than surgical options, and are associated with fewer complications and nutritional deficits. Currently, there is a large spectrum of endoscopic methods based on the principles of gastric volume reduction, size restriction and gastric or small bowel bypass being explored with only few available in routine practice. The aim of this publication is to present an up‐to‐date summary of available endoscopic methods for the treatment of obesity focusing on their efficacy, safety and nutritional aspects. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Emerging pollutants (EP) are the group of contaminants newly detected in aquatic environments around the globe. Conventional water purification systems are less efficient in removing these pollutants; therefore, innovative, and eco-friendly technologies are needed. Recently, semiconductor-supported photocatalysis has attracted attention in environmental remediation for removing EP's owing to their unique characteristics of low-cost, higher thermal and mechanical stability, and excellent pollutant removal efficiency. The charge separation and effective light absorption, particularly in the visible region, are two essential characteristics in photocatalyst which are hard to achieve. Several approaches have been adopted to enhance the charge separation and light-absorption ability in the visible range, including elemental-doping, morphology-engineering, and composite photocatalyst formation. This review concisely discusses the several recently discovered EP's, their fate and transport properties, as well as recent progress in the design and development of visible light-responsive photocatalysts for degradation of EP's. Furthermore, synthesis methods, key features such as optical properties, energy-bandgap structure, crystallinity, and surface features are emphasized in this review. The influencing process parameters, reusability, and stability of photocatalyst are also outlined. Finally, the summary and future perspectives for designing a sustainable photocatalysis system are presented. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Teeth have unique histology that make this biomatrix a time-capsule for retrospective exposure analysis of fetal and early life. However, most analytic methods require pulverizing the whole tooth, which eliminates exposure timing information. Further, the range of chemicals and endogenous exposures that can be measured in teeth has yet to be fully characterized. Methods: We performed untargeted metabolomics on micro-dissected layers from naturally shed deciduous teeth. Using four liquid-chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry analytical modes, we profiled small molecules (<1000 Da) from prenatal and postnatal tooth fractions. In addition, we employed linear regression on the tooth fraction pairs from 31 children to identify metabolites that discriminate between prenatal and postnatal exposures. Results: Of over 10,000 features measured in teeth dentin, 390 unique compounds were annotated from 62 chemical classes. The class with the largest number of compounds was carboxylic acids and their derivatives (36%). Of the annotated exogenous metabolites (phthalates, parabens, perfluoroalkyl compounds, and cotinine) and endogenous metabolites (fatty acids, steroids, carnitines, amino acids, and others), 91 are linked to 256 health conditions through published literature. Differential analysis revealed 267 metabolites significantly different between the prenatal and the postnatal tooth fractions (adj. p-value < 0.05, Bonferroni correction), and 21 metabolites exclusive to the prenatal fraction. Conclusions: The prenatal and early postnatal exposome revealed from dental biomarkers represents a broad range of endogenous and exogenous metabolites for a comprehensive characterization in environmental health research. Most importantly, this technology provides a direct window into fetal exposures that is not possible by maternal biomarkers. Indeed, we identified several metabolites exclusively in the prenatal fraction, suggesting unique fetal exposures that are markedly different to postnatal exposures. Expansion of databases that include tooth matrix metabolites will strengthen biological interpretation and shed light on exposures during gestation and early life that may be causally linked with later health conditions. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={As replacements for “old” organohalides, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), “new” organohalides have been developed, including decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs), and perfluorobutyrate (PFBA). In the past decade, these emerging organohalides (EOHs) have been extensively produced as industrial and consumer products, resulting in their widespread environmental distribution. This review comprehensively summarizes the environmental occurrence and remediation methods for typical EOHs. Based on the data collected from 2015 to 2021, these EOHs are widespread in both abiotic (e.g., dust, air, soil, sediment, and water) and biotic (e.g., bird, fish, and human serum) matrices. A significant positive correlation was found between the estimated annual production amounts of EOHs and their environmental contamination levels, suggesting the prohibition of both production and usage of EOHs as a critical pollution-source control strategy. The strengths and weaknesses, as well as the future prospects of up-to-date remediation techniques, such as photodegradation, chemical oxidation, and biodegradation, are critically discussed. Of these remediation techniques, microbial reductive dehalogenation represents a promising in situ remediation method for removal of EOHs, such as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Interest in recovering and reclaiming refrigerant gases is growing as a consequence of increasing concern about the high global warming potential of some hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). However, advanced separation processes, like extractive distillation, are required to selectively separate azeotropic and close-boiling refrigerant mixtures. In this regard, ionic liquids (ILs) arise as promising entrainers because of their favorable properties, including nonvolatility and good HFC solubility selectivity. The aim of this review is to become a reference text for the research and design of novel separation processes for mixtures of fluorinated gases based on the use of ILs. We include an extensive compilation of publications on equilibrium, mass transport, and absorption and membrane separation related to the use of ILs to selectively separate, not only the most relevant refrigerants employed nowadays, namely, HFCs, hydrofluoroolefins, and hydrochlorofluoroolefins, but also other relevant refrigerant families, such as chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons. The UC-RAIL database provided as Supplementary Information compiles more than 5000 data points that are comprehensively analyzed in the review focusing on process design. Finally, we provide a set of directions that lead to the recovery of fluorinated refrigerant gases, to shift the refrigeration and air conditioning sector towards a more circular economy. © 2021 The Author(s)},

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to verify this association by reviewing existing studies and to provide a strong basis for preventing ADHD. The researchers searched electronic databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Embase for all studies published before October 2020. Finally, we included nine articles for analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that maternal exposure to PFASs was not significantly associated with the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD (perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), odds ratio (OR) = 1.00, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.75–1.25; perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.88–1.14; perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.80–1.09; perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.99–1.28; perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.15–2.32). Due to significant heterogeneity, we subsequently performed subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. Through subgroup analysis, we found that PFOS concentration of children’s blood and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD were statistically positively correlated, and there was also a positive correlation between PFOS exposure and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD in the America. Moreover, there was also a statistically positive correlation between PFNA concentration in maternal blood and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD. Sensitivity analysis showed that the final results did not change much, the sensitivity was low, and the results were relatively stable. In conclusion, a causal relationship between maternal PFASs exposure and ADHD in children was unlikely. Among them, PFOS, PFNA, and ADHD might have positive associations worthy of further investigation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Probiotic supplementation is effective to modulate the metabolic disorders caused by perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS). However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To this end, the present study exposed adult zebrafish to PFBS (0 and 10 μg/L), probiotics, or their binary combinations for 40 days. After the exposure, the nutritional stores, intestinal organization, and metabolic activities along the gut-liver axis were investigated. The results showed that PFBS exposure decreased the nutrient reserves significantly, especially the lipid content, which was alleviated by the probiotic administration. Intestinal mucus secretion was promoted remarkably in the presence of the probiotic, which enhanced epithelial protection against PFBS damage. Metagenomic analysis showed that PFBS alone induced gut microbial dysbiosis, which was efficiently antagonized by the probiotic bacteria. Intestinal metabolomic profiling revealed that ferroptosis occurred because of the unrestricted lipid peroxidation following PFBS exposure. However, probiotic administration prevented the ferroptotic symptoms induced by PFBS, further highlighting the beneficial effects of the probiotic on the host. In PFBS-exposed livers, high levels of bile acid metabolites (e.g., taurochenodeoxycholic acid) accumulated, implying the induction of cholestasis. Notably, probiotic addition recovered the metabolomic homeostasis under PFBS stress, probably resulting from the activation of detoxification pathways based on the pentose and glucuronate interconversion. Overall, the present study provides systematic evidence of the antagonistic interaction between PFBS and the probiotic regarding the metabolic activities along the microbe, gut and liver axis, highlighting the application values of probiotic recipe in aquaculture industry and ecological reservation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Methods: Studies that compared the outcomes of 2G PFA and TKA in the treatment of isolated PFOA were searched in electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. Two researchers independently identified eligible studies, extracted the data, and evaluated the quality of the literature. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) or weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using either fixed or random effects models. Descriptive analysis was used when data could not be pooled. Results: A total of six studies were included in the review. For the revision percentage and complications, there were no significant differences between 2G PFA and TKA (RR = 2.29, 95% CI 0.69–7.58, P = 0.17; RR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.23–1.40, P = 0.22, respectively). Second, the results demonstrated that the differences in the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score between 2G PFA and TKA were not significant (WMD −4.68, 95% CI −16.32 to 6.97, p = 0.43; WMD 0.16, 95% CI −1.21 to 1.53, P = 0.82). The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the American Knee Society Score (AKSS), and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were presented in a narrative form due to methodological heterogeneity. Conclusion: For isolated PFOA, 2G PFA demonstrated similar results to TKA with respect to the percentages of revisions, complications, and PROMs. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Posterior fossa ependymoma (EPN-PF) can be classified into Group A posterior fossa ependymoma (EPN-PFA) and Group B posterior fossa ependymoma (EPN-PFB) according to DNA CpG island methylation profile status and gene expression. EPN-PFA usually occurs in children younger than 5 years and has a poor prognosis. Methods: Using epigenome and transcriptome microarray data, a multi-component weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to systematically identify the hub genes of EPN-PF. We downloaded two microarray datasets (GSE66354 and GSE114523) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The Limma R package was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and ChAMP R was used to analyze the differential methylation genes (DMGs) between EPN-PFA and EPN-PFB. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using the Metascape database. Results: GO analysis showed that enriched genes were significantly enriched in the extracellular matrix organization, adaptive immune response, membrane raft, focal adhesion, NF-kappa B pathway, and axon guidance, as suggested by KEGG analysis. Through WGCNA, we found that MEblue had a significant correlation with EPN-PF (R = 0.69, P = 1 × 10–08) and selected the 180 hub genes in the blue module. By comparing the DEGs, DMGs, and hub genes in the co-expression network, we identified five hypermethylated, lower expressed genes in EPN-PFA (ATP4B, CCDC151, DMKN, SCN4B, and TUBA4B), and three of them were confirmed by IHC. Conclusion: ssGSEA and GSVA analysis indicated that these five hub genes could lead to poor prognosis by inducing hypoxia, PI3K-Akt-mTOR, and TNFα-NFKB pathways. Further study of these dysmethylated hub genes in EPN-PF and the pathways they participate in may provides new ideas for EPN-PF treatment. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Methods: We retrieved RCTs from medical research literature databases. Risk ratios (RR), standard mean difference (SMD), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to compare the primary and safety endpoints. Results: Overall, a total of 8886 patients were retrieved from 57 articles, of which 4448 patients (50.06%) were randomized to experimental group whereas 4438 patients (49.94%) were randomized to control group. The result showed that FTS could significantly shorten the length of stay (LOS), decrease the visual analog scale (VAS), reduce the leaving bed time and the hospitalization costs, and improve Harris hip joint function score. The incidence of complications such as respiratory system infection, urinary system infection, venous thrombus embolism (VTE), pressure sore, incision infection, constipation, and prosthesis dislocation also has been decreased significantly. Meanwhile, FTS improved patients’ satisfaction apparently. Conclusions: This meta-analysis reveals that FTS could significantly shorten the length of stay, alleviate the pain, reduce the leaving bed time and the hospitalization costs, and improve hip function. The incidence of complications also has been decreased significantly. Meanwhile, FTS has been spoken highly in patients in terms of nursing satisfaction.

abstract={Background: Dietary sphingolipids have various biofunctions, including skin barrier improvement and anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinoma properties. Long-chain bases (LCBs), the essential backbones of sphingolipids, are expected to be important for these bioactivities, and they vary structurally between species. Given these findings, however, the absorption dynamics of each LCB remain unclear. Methods: In this study, five structurally different LCBs were prepared from glucosylceramides (GlcCers) with LCB 18:2(4E,8Z);2OH and LCB 18:2(4E,8E);2OH moieties derived from konjac tuber (Amorphophallus konjac), from GlcCers with an LCB 18(9Me):2(4E,8E);2OH moiety derived from Tamogi mushroom (Pleurotus cornucopiae var. citrinopileatus), and from ceramide 2-aminoethyphosphonate with LCB 18:3(4E,8E,10E);2OH moiety and LCB 18(9Me):3(4E,8E,10E);2OH moiety derived from giant scallop (Mizuhopecten yessoensis), and their absorption percentages and metabolite levels were analyzed using a lymph-duct-cannulated rat model via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) with a multistage fragmentation method. Results: The five orally administered LCBs were absorbed and detected in chyle (lipid-containing lymph) as LCBs and several metabolites including ceramides, hexosylceramides, and sphingomyelins. The absorption percentages of LCBs were 0.10–1.17%, depending on their structure. The absorption percentage of LCB 18:2(4E,8Z);2OH was the highest (1.17%), whereas that of LCB 18:3(4E,8E,10E);2OH was the lowest (0.10%). The amount of sphingomyelin with an LCB 18:2(4E,8Z);2OH moiety in chyle was particularly higher than sphingomyelins with other LCB moieties. Conclusions: Structural differences among LCBs, particularly geometric isomerism at the C8–C9 position, significantly affected the absorption percentages and ratio of metabolites. This is the first report to elucidate that the absorption and metabolism of sphingolipids are dependent on their LCB structure. These results could be used to develop functional foods that are more readily absorbed. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Efficient utilization of all available carbons from lignocellulosic biomass is critical for economic efficiency of a bioconversion process to produce renewable bioproducts. However, the metabolic responses that enable Pseudomonas putida to utilize mixed carbon sources to generate reducing power and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) remain unclear. Previous research has mainly focused on different fermentation strategies, including the sequential feeding of xylose as the growth stage substrate and octanoic acid as the PHA-producing substrate, feeding glycerol as the sole carbon substrate, and co-feeding of lignin and glucose. This study developed a new strategy—co-feeding glycerol and lignin derivatives such as benzoate, vanillin, and vanillic acid in Pseudomonas putida KT2440—for the first time, which simultaneously improved both cell biomass and PHA production. Results: Co-feeding lignin derivatives (i.e. benzoate, vanillin, and vanillic acid) and glycerol to P. putida KT2440 was shown for the first time to simultaneously increase cell dry weight (CDW) by 9.4–16.1% and PHA content by 29.0–63.2%, respectively, compared with feeding glycerol alone. GC–MS results revealed that the addition of lignin derivatives to glycerol decreased the distribution of long-chain monomers (C10 and C12) by 0.4–4.4% and increased the distribution of short-chain monomers (C6 and C8) by 0.8–3.5%. The 1H–13C HMBC, 1H–13C HSQC, and 1H–1H COSY NMR analysis confirmed that the PHA monomers (C6–C14) were produced when glycerol was fed to the bacteria alone or together with lignin derivatives. Moreover, investigation of the glycerol/benzoate/nitrogen ratios showed that benzoate acted as an independent factor in PHA synthesis. Furthermore, 1H, 13C and 31P NMR metabolite analysis and mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics measurements suggested that the addition of benzoate stimulated oxidative-stress responses, enhanced glycerol consumption, and altered the intracellular NAD+/NADH and NADPH/NADP+ ratios by up-regulating the proteins involved in energy generation and storage processes, including the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway, the reductive TCA route, trehalose degradation, fatty acid β-oxidation, and PHA biosynthesis. Conclusions: This work demonstrated an effective co-carbon feeding strategy to improve PHA content/yield and convert lignin derivatives into value-added products in P. putida KT2440. Co-feeding lignin break-down products with other carbon sources, such as glycerol, has been demonstrated as an efficient way to utilize biomass to increase PHA production in P. putida KT2440. Moreover, the involvement of aromatic degradation favours further lignin utilization, and the combination of proteomics and metabolomics with NMR sheds light on the metabolic and regulatory mechanisms for cellular redox balance and potential genetic targets for a higher biomass carbon conversion efficiency.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2021, The Author(s).},

To analyze the evolution of the concentration and prevalence of POPs such as α-HCH, β-HCH, γ-HCH, ∑-HCH, Heptachlor, Aldrin, p,p′-DDE, p,p′-DDT, ∑-DDT, and ∑-OCP in water resources, a search between January 01, 1970, to February 10, 2020, was followed using a systematic review and meta-analysis prevalence. Among the 2306 explored articles in the reconnaissance step, 311 articles with 5315 exemplars, 56 countries, and 4 types of water were included in the meta-analysis study. Among all studied POPs, the concentration of p,p′-DDT in water resources was the highest, especially in drinking water resources. The overall rank order based on the concentration and prevalence of POPs were surface water > drinking water > seawater > groundwater. To identify POPs-contaminated areas, the distance from the mean relative to their distribution was considered. The most to the least polluted areas included: South Africa, India, Turkey, Pakistan, Canada, Hong Kong, and China. The highest carcinogenic risk was observed for β-HCH (Turkey and China), followed by α-HCH (Mexico). The highest non-carcinogenic risk was identified for Aldrin (all analyzed countries), followed by Dieldrin (Turkey) and γ-HCH (Mexico). The Monte Carlo analysis (under the assumption that γ-HCH has a normal distribution), the mean obtained was 8.22E−07 for children and 3.83E−07 for adults. This is in accordance with the standard risk assessment approach. In terms of percentiles, the Monte-Carlo approach indicates that 75% of child population is under the 1.07E−06 risk and 95% of adults under 7.35E−06. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a type of persistent organic pollutant that has been detected in wastewater treatment systems, subsequently entering the waste activated sludge (WAS) anaerobic digesters. Nevertheless, how PFOA affects the anaerobic digestion of WAS has never been reported till now. In this study, a series of batch digesters were set up to assess the performance of the anaerobic sludge digestion processes with exposures to different levels of PFOA. Experimental results revealed that the increased PFOA concentration (3–60 μg/g-TS) caused the 11.1–19.2% decrease in methane production than the control. Correspondingly, the relative abundances of several key microbes related to acidification (e.g., Longilinea sp.) and methanation (e.g., Methanosaeta sp.) decreased when exposed to PFOA, as demonstrated by microbial community analysis. Further investigations based on modelling and intermediate metabolites analysis confirmed the inhibition of acidification and methanation caused by PFOA, thus decreasing the methane production potential of WAS in anaerobic digestion. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={BACKGROUND Proximal femoral nails (PFNs) are the most common method for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric femoral fractures (IFFs), but postoperative bed rest is required. There is a large amount of blood loss during the operation. Osteoporosis in elderly patients may cause nonunion of fractures and other complications. Arthroplasty can give patients early weight bearing and reduce financial burden, but whether it can replace PFNs remains controversial. AIM To compare the clinical outcomes of arthroplasty and PFNs in the treatment of unstable IFFs in elderly patients. METHODS A search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases and included relevant articles comparing arthroplasty and PFN. The search time was limited from January 1, 2005 to November 1, 2020. Two investigators independently screened studies, extracted data and evaluated the quality according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. According to the research results, the fixed effect model or random effect model were selected for analysis. The following outcomes were analyzed: Harris Hip score, mortality, complications, operation time, blood loos, hospital stay, weight-bearing time, fracture classification and type of anesthesia. RESULTS We analyzed four randomized controlled trials that met the requirements. A total of 298 patients were included in these studies. According to the AO/OTA classification, there are 20 A1 types, 136 A2 types, 42 A3 types and 100 unrecorded types. Primary outcome: The Harris Hip Score at the final follow-up of the PFN group was higher [mean difference (MD): 9.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 16.57 to 1.45), P = 0.02]. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the rate of overall mortality [risk ratio (RR): 1.44, P = 0.44] or the number of complications (RR: 0.77, P = 0.05). Secondary outcomes: blood loss of the arthroplasty group was higher (MD: 241.01, 95% CI: 43.06–438.96, P = 0.02); the operation time of the PFN group was shorter (MD: 23.12, 95%CI: 10.46–35.77, P = 0.0003); and the length of hospital stay of the arthroplasty group was shorter [MD: 0.97, 95% CI: 1.29 to 0.66), P<0.00001]. There was no difference between the two groups in the type of anesthesia (RR: 0.99). There were only two studies recording the weight-bearing time, and the time of full weight bearing in the arthroplasty group was significantly earlier. CONCLUSION Compared with PFN, arthroplasty can achieve weight bearing earlier and shorten hospital stay, but it cannot achieve a better clinical outcome. Arthroplasty cannot replace PFNs in the treatment of unstable IFFs in elderly individuals. ©The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.},

Based on the mechanism of olefin formation, four key factors controlling the nature of catalyst functions were reviewed, including active metal/phase, transition metal promoter, alkali promoter, and catalyst support, for improving olefins or aromatics selectivity, while the photocatalytic form as a novel reaction system is also introduced. In the last part, we discussed the challenges in improving product selectivity and catalyst stability, the strategy in catalyst design and catalytic system from a new perspective, the method for understanding the relationship between catalyst structure and catalytic performance, and the potential industrialization for FTO/FTA. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic organic molecules used to manufacture various consumer and industrials products. In PFAS, the CF bond is stable, which renders these compounds chemically stable and prevents their breakdown. Several PFAS treatment processes such as adsorption, photolysis and photocatalysis, bioremediation, sonolysis, electrochemical oxidation, etc., have been explored and are being developed. The present review article has critically summarized degradative technologies and provides in-depth knowledge of photodegradation, electrochemical degradation, chemical oxidation, and reduction mineralization mechanism. Also, novel non-degradative technologies, including nano-adsorbents, natural and surface-modified clay minerals/zeolites, calixarene-based polymers, and molecularly imprinted polymers and adsorbents derived from biomaterials are discussed in detail. Of these novel approaches photocatalysis combined with membrane filtration or electrochemical oxidation via a treatment train approach shows promising results in removing PFAS in natural waters. The photocatalytic mineralization mechanism of PFOA is discussed, leading to recommendations for future research on novel remediation strategies for removing PFAS from water.

Based on the analysis of the interaction mechanism between antibiotics and heavy metals, the research progress of the main treatment technologies of wastewater polluted by antibiotics and heavy metals is reviewed, and the mechanism of action and advantages and disadvantages are summarized. The results showed that the interaction between antibiotics and heavy metals was affected by the types of functional groups, the types of heavy metal ions and the pH of the solution. Adsorption is currently the most used method, and photocatalysis and constructed wetland methods have broad application prospects. The modification of flocculant or zero-valent iron can enhance the treatment effect of wastewater with combined antibiotics and heavy metal pollution. The combination of various methods has great potential for treating combined pollution of antibiotics and heavy metals in water. It is recommended that future research should focus on the following aspects: (1) The application of various treatment technologies in actual environmental water bodies; (2) The environmental impact of complex pollution and the formulation and improvement of relevant laws and regulations; (3) The generation mechanism and influencing factors of emerging pollutant resistance genes. © 2021, Editorial Board, Research of Environmental Sciences.

abstract={Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is an important perfluorinated surfactant, which has received great attention as an emerging pollutant, due to its persistence, high toxicity, and bioaccumulation. Sediment is an important environmental reservoir for PFOA, while polluted sediment can serve as a long-term contamination source causing pollution to overlying surface water and surrounding groundwater. Here, the source, pollution level, adsorption and transport of PFOA at the sediment-water interface were systematically reviewed. Industrial discharge was the major release for PFOA entering surface water and sediment. PFOA was generally at ng•L-1 and ng•g-1 levels in global surface water and sediment. More serious pollution was found in some parts of China. Sediment composition, hadrochemical condition, natural organic matter, and surfactants could strongly affect PFOA adsorption in sediment, though the controlling mechanisms were controversial. Research on PFOA transport in sediment had just been started with limited progress. There is a great gap in understanding the mechanisms underlying PFOA transport in sediment, which should be strengthened in the future. © 2021, Science Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={Background: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS), as a new concept in surgery, has dramatically changed the mode of perioperative treatment for children with acute appendicitis. Methods: The retrieval strategy developed by the Cochrane Collaboration was conducted using the CNKI database, Wanfang Medical Network, PubMed, EBSCO, Medline, and Cochrane database by combining subject headings and free words. A review of the randomized controlled trials on the use of the ERAS concept in the perioperative treatment of acute appendicitis in children was conducted between the establishment of the database and May 15, 2021. Keywords included enhanced recovery after surgery, fast track surgery, ERAS, FTS, child, infant, and appendicitis. The quality of the literature was evaluated according to the RevMan 5.3 software provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. Results: Five randomized controlled trials on ERAS in children with acute appendicitis were finally included. The heterogeneity of postoperative stay time was tested in 4 studies using continuous variables, with Chi-squared test (Chi2) =221.52, degree of freedom (df) =3, I2=99%>50%. An overall analysis using a random effects model showed that the ERAS group was significantly different compared to the control group [Z=5.26; mean difference (MD) =-1.65; 95% CI: -2.27 to -1.03; P<0.00001]. The heterogeneity of the readmission rate was tested in 5 studies using dichotomous variables, with Chi2=5.11, df =3, I2=41%<50%, P=0.91. Overall analysis using a fixed effects model showed no statistically significant difference between the ERAS group and the control group [Z=0.80; odds ratio (OR) =1.16; 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.66; P=0.42]. The heterogeneity of the recurrence rate was tested in 4 studies using dichotomous variables, with Chi2=3.73, df =3, I2=20%<50%, P=0.29. Overall analysis using a fixed effects model showed no statistically significant difference between the ERAS group and the control group (Z=1.14; OR =0.76; 95% CI: 0.47 to 1.22; P=0.26). Discussion: The results of the meta-analysis confirmed that perioperative application of the ERAS concept in children with acute appendicitis can promote the rehabilitation of children, reduce the postoperative stay time, and reduce the readmission rate and reoperation rate. © 2021 AME Publishing Company.

abstract={Background: Unfortunately, the majority of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM) experience disease recurrence following hepatic surgery. The key challenge is therefore optimal patient selection, which currently relies on anatomical and clinical parameters. Exploring a potential molecular signature may be predictive for seeing a clinical benefit from CRCLM resection. Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent CRCLM resection at our medical center between 2006 and 2016 were divided into cohorts of “good prognosis” (GP) or “poor prognosis” (PP) based on the time interval between their resection and disease recurrence. Proteomic analysis was performed on the surgical specimen and correlation analysis was carried out with demographics and clinical outcomes. Results: Proteomic analysis revealed 99 differentially expressed proteins of which a third were associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) pathways as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Multivariate analysis yielded a statistically differential proteomic pattern between the cohort regardless of perioperative treatment. Conclusion: Our results indicate a different proteomic landscape in the cohort of patients who had a clinical benefit from CRCLM resection which appears to be correlated with ECM pathways. Further prospective studies are needed to define the role of ECM pathways in prognostics and patient selection for surgical procedures for CRCLM. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is an emerging pollutant commonly found in industrial wastewater, owing to its extensive usage as an additive in the manufacturing industry. PVA’s popularity has made wastewater treatment technologies for PVA degradation a popular research topic in industrial wastewater treatment. Although many PVA degradation technologies are studied in bench‐scale processes, recent advancements in process optimization and control of wastewater treatment technologies such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) show the feasibility of these processes by monitoring and controlling processes to meet desired regulatory standards. These wastewater treatment technologies exhibit complex reaction mechanisms leading to nonlinear and nonstationary behavior related to variability in operational conditions. Thus, black‐box dynamic modeling is a promising tool for designing control schemes since dynamic modeling is more complicated in terms of first principles and reaction mechanisms. This study seeks to provide a survey of process control methods via a comprehensive review focusing on PVA degradation methods, including biological and advanced oxidation processes, along with their reaction mechanisms, control‐oriented dynamic modeling (i.e., state‐space, transfer function, and artificial neural network modeling), and control strategies (i.e., proportional‐integral‐derivative control and predictive control) associated with wastewater treatment technologies utilized for PVA degradation. © 2021 by the authors.

As such, the implications of utilising non-biodegradable membrane materials are outlined. In comparison, considerations on the concept of utilising nanostructured biodegradable polymeric membranes are also outlined. Such biodegradable polymers under considerations include biopolymers-derived cellulose and carrageenan. The advantages of these biopolymer materials include renewability, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and cost-effectiveness when compared to non-biodegradable polymers. The modifications of the biopolymeric membranes were also deliberated in detail. This included the utilisation of cellulose as matrix support for nanomaterials. Furthermore, attention towards the recent advances on using nanofillers towards the stabilisation and enhancement of biopolymeric membrane performances towards organic contaminants removal. It was noted that most of the biopolymeric membrane applications focused on organic dyes (methyl blue, Congo red, azo dyes), crude oil, hexane, and pharmaceutical chemicals such as tetracycline. However, more studies should be dedicated towards emerging pollutants such as micropollutants. The biopolymeric membrane performances such as rejection capabilities, fouling resistance, and water permeability properties were also outlined. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Although the toxicity of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) is recognized at different trophic levels, our know-how about their effects on amphibians is limited. Thus, we present and discuss the current state on studies involving amphibians and plastic particles, based on a broad approach to studies published in the last 5 years. To search for the articles, the ISI Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases were consulted, using different descriptors related to the topic of study. After the systematic search, we identified 848 publications. Of these, 12 studies addressed the relationship “plastic particles and amphibians” (7 studies developed in the laboratory and 5 field studies). The scientometric analysis points to geographic concentration of studies in Brazil and China; low investment in research in the area, and limited participation of international authors in the studies carried out. In the systematic approach, we confirm the scarcity of available data on the toxicity of plastic particles in amphibians; we observed a concentration of studies in the Anura order, only one study explored the toxicological effects of NPs and polystyrene and polyethylene are the most studied plastic types. Moreover, the laboratory tested concentrations are distant from those of the environmentally relevant; and little is known about the mechanisms of action of NPs/MPs involved in the identified (eco)toxicological effects. Thus, we strongly recommend more investments in this area, given the ubiquitous nature of NPs/MPs in aquatic environments and their possible consequences on the dynamics, reproduction, and survival of species in the natural environment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a class of artificial compounds comprised of a perfluoroalkyl main chain and a terminal functional group. With them being applied in a wide range of applications, PFASs have drawn increasing regulatory attention and research interests on their reductions and treatments due to their harmful effects on environment and human beings. Among numerous studies, chemical treatments (e.g., photochemical, electrochemical, and thermal technologies) have been proved to be important methods to degradation PFASs. However, the pathways and mechanisms for the degradation of PFASs through these chemical methods still have not been well documented. This article therefore provides a comprehensive review on the degradation mechanisms of two important PFASs (perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)) with photochemical, electrochemical and thermal methods. Different decomposition mechanisms of PFOA and PFOS are reviewed and discussed. Overall, the degradation pathways of PFASs are associated closely with their head groups and chain lengths, and H/F exchange and chain shortening were found to be predominant degradation mechanisms. The clear study on the degradation mechanisms of PFOA and PFOS should be very useful for the complete degradation or mineralization of PFASs in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exist extensively and several of these have been verified to be toxic. Prenatal exposure to PFASs has attracted much attention. Metabolome-wide association analyses can be used to explore the toxicity mechanisms of PFASs by identifying associated biomarkers. Objectives: To evaluate associations between the metabolites in maternal and cord serum and internal exposure to several common PFASs. Methods: Paired maternal and cord serum samples were collected from 84 pregnant women who gave birth between 2015 and 2016. Seven legacy and two novel PFASs were measured. A nontarget metabolomic method and an iterative metabolite annotation based on metabolic pathways were applied to characterize the metabolic profiles. Linear regression adjusted with the false discovery rate and covariates was used to indicate the associations. Results: A total of 279 features in maternal serum and 338 features in cord serum were identified as metabolites associated with PFAS exposure. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) were two PFASs associated with more metabolites, while the two novel chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acids (Cl-PFESAs) showed less relevance to the metabolome. With pathway enrichment analysis, we found that three fatty acid metabolisms and retinol metabolism were correlated with PFAS exposure in maternal blood, and that sterol metabolism showed the correlation in both maternal serum and cord serum. Conclusions: We identified metabolites and pathways in pregnant women and fetuses associated with the exposure to several PFAS, indicating a promising application for metabolome-wide association studies. Additional research is needed to confirm causation. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Certain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exhibit significant bioaccumulation/biomagnification behaviors in ecosystems. PFASs, such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and related precursors, have elicited attention from both public and national regulatory agencies, which has resulted in worldwide restrictions on their production and use. Apex predators occupy the top trophic positions in ecosystems and are most affected by the biomagnification behavior of PFASs. Meanwhile, the long lifespans of apex predators also lead to the high body burden of PFASs. The high body burden of PFASs might be linked to adverse health effects and even pose a potential threat to their reproduction. As seen in previous reviews of PFASs, knowledge is lacking between the current stage of the PFAS body burden and related effects in apex predators. This review summarized PFAS occurrence in global apex predators, including information on the geographic distribution, levels, profiles, and tissue distribution, and discussed the trophic transfer and ecotoxicity of PFASs. In the case where legacy PFASs were restricted under international convention, the occurrence of novel PFASs, such as 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) and perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate (PFECHS), in apex predators arose as an emerging issue. Future studies should develop an effective analytical method and focus on the toxicity and trophic transfer behavior of novel PFASs. © 2021},

abstract={Precision biotransformation is an envisioned strategy offering detailed insights into biotransformation pathways in real environmental settings using experimentally guided high-Accuracy quantum chemistry. Emerging pollutants, whose metabolites are easily overlooked but may cause idiosyncratic toxicity, are important targets of such a strategy. We demonstrate here that complex metabolic reactions of tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) catalyzed by human CYP450 enzymes can be mapped via a three-step synergy strategy: (i) screening the possible metabolites via high-Throughout (moderate-Accuracy) computations; (ii) analyzing the proposed metabolites in vitro by human liver microsomes and recombinant human CYP450 enzymes; and (iii) rationalizing the experimental data via precise mechanisms using high-level targeted computations. Through the bilateral dialogues from qualitative to semi-quantitative to quantitative levels, we show how TDCIPP metabolism especially by CYP3A4 generates bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP) as an O-dealkylation metabolite and bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) 3-chloro-1-hydroxy-2-propyl phosphate (alcoholβ-dehalogen) as a dehalogenation/reduction metabolite via the initial rate-determining H-Abstraction from αC-and βC-positions. The relative yield ratio [dehalogenation/reduction]/[O-dealkylation] is derived from the relative barriers of H-Abstraction at the βC-and αC-positions by CYP3A4, estimated as 0.002 to 0.23, viz., an in vitro measured ratio of 0.04. Importantly, alcoholβ-dehalogen formation points to a new mechanism involving successive oxidation and reduction functions of CYP450, with its precursor aldehydeβ-dehalogen being a key intermediate detected by trapping assays and rationalized by computations. We conclude that the proposed three-step synergy strategy may meet the increasing challenge of elucidating biotransformation mechanisms of substantial synthesized organic compounds in the future. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

abstract={Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) has been marketed as a substitute for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) to reduce environmental and health risks. GenX and PFOA have been detected in various natural water sources, and adsorption is recognized as a typical treatment process for PFOA removal. In this paper, comparisons of GenX and PFOA adsorption are evaluated, including adsorption potential, adsorption mechanisms, and associated costs. A detailed literature review suggests that anion-exchange resins are more effective in removing GenX than activated carbon. GenX removal efficiency through activated carbon (30%) is lower than that of PFOA (80–95%), while GenX and PFOA removal efficiencies by anion exchange resins are similar (99%). Unconventional adsorbents, such as ionic fluorogels and covalent organic frameworks can effectively remove GenX from water. The review reveals that GenX adsorption is more challenging, requiring almost 4 times the treatment cost of its predecessor, PFOA. Annual operation and maintenance costs for GenX adsorption (initial concentration of GenX and PFOA = 0.2 µg.L−1) by GAC for treating 10,000 m3 per day is almost US$1,000,000 per year, but only around US$240,000 per year for PFOA. Desorption of GenX in the presence of PFOA highlights GenX's inferior treatability by adsorption. It is believed that GenX is a more environmentally friendly compound than PFOA, but this environmental friendliness comes with the price. © 2021},

abstract={The deep sea - an oceanic layer below 200 m depths – has important global biogeochemical and nutrient cycling functions. It also receives organic pollutants from anthropogenic sources, which threatens the ecological function of the deep sea. In this Review, critically examined data on the distribution of organic pollutants in the deep sea to outline the role of biogeochemical and geophysical factors on the global distribution and regional chemodynamics of organic pollutants in the deep sea. We found that the contribution of deep water formation to the influx of perfluorinated compounds reached a maximum, following peak emission, faster in young deep waters (&lt; 10 years) compared to older deep waters (&gt; 100 years). For example, perfluorinated compounds had low concentrations (&lt; 10 pg L−1) and vertical variations in the South Pacific Ocean where the ocean currents are old (&lt; 1000 years). Steep geomorphologies of submarine canyons, ridges, and valleys facilitated the transport of sediments and associated organic pollutants by oceanic currents from the continental shelf to remote deep seas. In addition, we found that, even though an estimated 1.2–4.2 million metric tons of plastic debris enter the ocean through riverine discharge annually, the role of microplastics as vectors of organic pollutants (e.g., plastic monomers, additives, and attached organic pollutants) in the deep sea is often overlooked. Finally, we recommend assessing the biological effects of organic pollutants in deep sea biota, large-scale monitoring of organic pollutants, reconstructing historical emissions using sediment cores, and assessing the impact of deep-sea mining on the ecosystem. © 2021},

Emerging pollutants (EPs) that accumulate in environmental compartments also pose a potential risk for the enrichment of ARGs in indigenous microorganisms. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the effects and intrinsic mechanisms of EPs, including microplastics, engineered nanomaterials, disinfection byproducts, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, on the occurrence and dissemination of ARGs. State-of-the-art methods for identifying culture-independent ARG-host interactions and monitoring horizontal gene transfer (HGT) processes in real-time are first reviewed. The contributions of EPs to the abundance and diversity of ARGs are then summarized. Finally, we discussed the underlying mechanisms related to the regulation of HGT, increased mutagenesis, and the evolution of microbial communities. Further details of three HGT (i.e., conjugation, transformation, and transduction) frequency patterns in response to various EPs are also examined. This review contemplates and reassesses the risks of ARG evolution posed by the manufacture and application of EPs © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Childhood posterior fossa group A ependymomas (PFAs) have limited treatment options and bear dismal prognoses compared to group B ependymomas (PFBs). PFAs overexpress the oncohistone-like protein EZHIP (enhancer of Zeste homologs inhibitory protein), causing global reduction of repressive histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), similar to the oncohistone H3K27M. Integrated metabolic analyses in patient-derived cells and tumors, single-cell RNA sequencing of tumors, and noninvasive metabolic imaging in patients demonstrated enhanced glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolism in PFAs. Furthermore, high glycolytic gene expression in PFAs was associated with a poor outcome. PFAs demonstrated high EZHIP expression associated with poor prognosis and elevated activating mark histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac). Genomic H3K27ac was enriched in PFAs at key glycolytic and TCA cycle–related genes including hexokinase-2 and pyruvate dehydrogenase. Similarly, mouse neuronal stem cells (NSCs) expressing wild-type EZHIP (EZHIP-WT) versus catalytically attenuated EZHIP-M406K demonstrated H3K27ac enrichment at hexokinase-2 and pyruvate dehydrogenase, accompanied by enhanced glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolism. AMPKα-2, a key component of the metabolic regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), also showed H3K27ac enrichment in PFAs and EZHIP-WT NSCs. The AMPK activator metformin lowered EZHIP protein concentrations, increased H3K27me3, suppressed TCA cycle metabolism, and showed therapeutic efficacy in vitro and in vivo in patient-derived PFA xenografts in mice. Our data indicate that PFAs and EZHIP-WT–expressing NSCs are characterized by enhanced glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolism. Repurposing the antidiabetic drug metformin lowered pathogenic EZHIP, increased H3K27me3, and suppressed tumor growth, suggesting that targeting integrated metabolic/epigenetic pathways is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating childhood ependymomas.

abstract={Scavenging of gas- and aerosol-phase organic pollutants by rain is an efficient wet deposition mechanism of organic pollutants. However, whereas snow has been identified as a key amplification mechanism of fugacities in cold environments, rain has received less attention in terms of amplification of organic pollutants. In this work, we provide new measurements of concentrations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), organophosphate esters (OPEs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in rain from Antarctica, showing high scavenging ratios. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of previously published concentrations in air and rain was performed, with 46 works covering different climatic regions and a wide range of chemical classes, including PFAS, OPEs, PAHs, polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine compounds, polybromodiphenyl ethers, and dioxins. The rain-aerosol (KRP) and rain-gas (KRG) partition constants averaged 105.5and 104.1, respectively, but showed large variability. The high field-derived values ofKRGare consistent with adsorption onto the raindrops as a scavenging mechanism, in addition to gas-water absorption. The amplification of fugacities by rain deposition was up to 3 orders of magnitude for all chemical classes and was comparable to that due to snow. The amplification of concentrations and fugacities by rain underscores its relevance, explaining the occurrence of organic pollutants in environments across different climatic regions. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Per and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been recognized as contaminants of emerging concerns by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) due to their environmental impact. Several advisory guidelines were proposed worldwide aimed at limiting their occurrences in the aquatic environments, especially for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). This review paper aims to provide a holistic review in the emerging area of PFAS research by summarizing the spatiotemporal variations in PFAS concentrations in surface water systems globally, highlighting the possible trends of occurrences of PFAS, and presenting potential human health impacts as a result of PFAS exposure through surface water matrices. From the data analysis in this study, occurrences of PFOA and PFOS in many surface water matrices were observed to be several folds higher than the US EPA health advisory level of 70 ng/L for lifetime exposure from drinking water. Direct discharge and atmospheric deposition were identified as primary sources of PFAS in surface water and cryosphere, respectively. While global efforts focused on limiting usages of long-chain PFAS such as PFOS and PFOA, the practices of using short-chain PFAS such as perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and PFAS alternatives increased substantially. These compounds are also potentially associated with adverse impacts on human health, animals and biota. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Multicenter randomized clinical trials on pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) support evidence-based care. However, many of these studies include homogenous study populations lacking diversity. Heterogeneous sampling allows for greater generalizability while increasing knowledge regarding specific subgroups. The racial/ethnic makeup of key pelvic floor disorder (PFD) trials has not been examined. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate racial/ethnic representation in major PFD clinical trials in comparison to racial/ethnic distribution of PFD in the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES). METHODS: Demographic data were extracted from completed PFD Network (PFDN) and Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network studies, which have resulted in nearly 200 publications. Prevalence of PFD by race/ethnicity was obtained from the NHANES. A representative index (Observed "n" by PFD study/Expected "n" based on the NHANES-reported prevalence) was calculated as a measure of representation. Meta-analyses were performed for each outcome and overall with respect to race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Eighteen PFDN/Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network studies were analyzed. White women comprised 70%-89% of PFD literature; Black women, 6%-16%; Hispanic women, 9%-15%; Asians, 0.5%-6%; and American Indians, 0%-2%. Representation of White women was higher in 13 of 18 PFDN studies compared with the NHANES prevalence data. Representation of Black women was either decreased or not reported in 10 of 18 index studies compared with the NHANES prevalence data. Hispanic women were absent or underrepresented in 7 of 18 PFDN studies compared with the prevalence data. CONCLUSIONS: Our examination of PFDN and other landmark trials demonstrates inconsistent reporting of minority subgroups, limiting applicability with respect to minority populations. Our study suggests that PFD research would benefit from targeted sampling of minority groups. Copyright © 2021 American Urogynecologic Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Primary liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers, which incidence continues to increase while treatment response remains poor; thus, in-depth understanding of tu-mour events is necessary to develop more effective therapies. Animal models for liver cancer are powerful tools to reach this goal. Over the past decade, our laboratory has established multiple oncogene transgenic zebrafish lines that can be robustly induced to develop liver cancer. Histolog-ical, transcriptomic and molecular analyses validate the use of these transgenic zebrafish as experimental models for liver cancer. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of our findings with these inducible zebrafish liver cancer models in tumour initiation, oncogene addiction, tumour microenvironment, gender disparity, cancer cachexia, drug screening and others. Induced oncogene expression causes a rapid change of the tumour microenvironment such as inflammatory responses, increased vascularisation and rapid hepatic growth. In several models, histologically-proven carcinoma can be induced within one week of chemical inducer administration. Interest-ingly, the induced liver tumours show the ability to regress when the transgenic oncogene is sup-pressed by the withdrawal of the chemical inducer. Like human liver cancer, there is a strong bias of liver cancer severity in male zebrafish. After long-term tumour progression, liver cancer-bearing zebrafish also show symptoms of cancer cachexia such as muscle-wasting. In addition, the zebrafish models have been used to screen for anti-metastasis drugs as well as to evaluate environmental toxicants in carcinogenesis. These findings demonstrated that these inducible zebrafish liver cancer models provide rapid and convenient experimental tools for further investigation of fundamental cancer biology, with the potential for the discovery of new therapeutic approaches. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Products containing per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been used for decades in industrial and consumer products. These compounds are persistent in the environment, bi-oaccumulative, and some are toxic to humans and other animals. Since the early 2000s, laws, poli-cies, and regulations have been implemented to reduce the prevalence of PFAS in the environment and exposures to PFAS. We conducted a scoping literature review to identify how PFAS are regulated internationally, at the U.S. national level, and at the U.S. state level, as well as drivers of and challenges to implementing PFAS regulations in the U.S. This review captured peer-reviewed scientific literature (e.g., PubMed), grey literature databases (e.g., SciTech Premium Collection), Google searches, and targeted websites (e.g., state health department websites). We identified 454 relevant documents, of which 61 discussed the non-U.S. PFAS policy, 214 discussed the U.S. national-level PFAS policy, and 181 discussed the U.S. state-level PFAS policy. The drivers of and challenges to PFAS regulation were identified through qualitative analysis. The drivers of PFAS policy identified were political support for regulation, social awareness of PFAS, economic resource availability, and compelling scientific evidence. The challenges to implementing PFAS regulations were political limitations, economic challenges, unclear scientific evidence, and practical challenges. The implications for PFAS policy makers and other stakeholders are discussed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are electrochemical devices focused on bioenergy generation and organic matter removal carried out by microorganisms under anoxic environments. In these types of systems, the anodic oxidation reaction is catalyzed by anaerobic microorganisms, while the cathodic reduction reaction can be carried out biotically or abiotically. Membranes as separators in MFCs are the primary requirements for optimal electrochemical and microbiological performance. MFC configuration and operation are similar to those of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs)—both having at least one anode and one cathode split by a membrane or separator. The Nafion® 117 (NF-117) membrane, made from perfluorosulfonic acid, is a membrane used as a separator in PEMFCs. By analogy of the operation between electrochemical systems and MFCs, NF-117 membranes have been widely used as separators in MFCs. The main disadvantage of this type of membrane is its high cost; membranes in MFCs can represent up to 60% of the MFC’s total cost. This is one of the challenges in scaling up MFCs: finding alternative membranes or separators with low cost and good electrochemical characteristics. The aim of this work is to critically review state-of-the-art membranes and separators used in MFCs. The scope of this review includes: (i) membrane functions in MFCs, (ii) most-used membranes, (iii) membrane cost and efficiency, and (iv) membrane-less MFCs. Currently, there are at least 20 different membranes or separators proposed and evaluated for MFCs, from basic salt bridges to advanced synthetic polymer-based membranes, including ceramic and unconventional separator materials. Studies focusing on either low cost or the use of natural polymers for proton-exchange membranes (PEM) are still scarce. Alternatively, in some works, MFCs have been operated without membranes; however, significant decrements in Coulombic efficiency were found. As the type of membrane affects the performance and total cost of MFCs, it is recommended that research efforts are increased in order to develop new, more economic membranes that exhibit favorable properties and allow for satisfactory cell performance at the same time. The current state of the art of membranes for MFCs addressed in this review will undoubtedly serve as a key insight for future research related to this topic. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The impact of environmental chemicals like persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on reproductive health is still poorly understood, despite the high societal and economical costs. The aim of the present study was to systematically review and evaluate the human evidence on the associations between internal levels of POPs and in vitro Fertilization (IVF) outcomes among women. We applied a protocol based on the National Toxicology Program Office of Health Assessment and Translation's guidelines for the study search, selection and quality assessment. Fifteen studies were finally retained in the present work. The results showed that main families of POPs are still pervasive in follicular fluid and serum of women undergoing IVF treatments. Globally, we found inconsistent findings across studies for specific exposure-outcome dyads, suggesting that adverse effects of POPs on IVF outcomes cannot be ruled out. Specifically, there is evidence that POPs, notably some polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides, may impair embryo quality and pregnancy rates. Most studies have been performed in small cohorts (n<50) and focused on PCBs and OCPs, whereas major research gaps remain for emerging compounds (e.g. perfluoroalkylated substances) and the most clinically relevant outcome, live birth rate. The overall evidence presented ‘serious’ or ‘very serious’ risk of bias, mainly due to the lack of consideration of relevant confounding variables, low sample size or underreporting of methods. Globally, we judged the level of evidence being “low”. Given the high economical and societal costs associated to infertility and IVF, further well-designed research is urged to fill the highlighted gaps. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones are versatile reagents that can be used to synthesize a wide range of diverse fluoroalkylated organic molecules. Although it has been known since 1975, the chemistry of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones has recently only received great attention from the scientific community. Generally, they are used as either safe and bench-stable diazo precursors in carbene transfer reactions or as 1,3-dipoles in cycloaddition and cyclization reactions. Notably, fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones to replace toxic fluoroalkyl diazo compounds in carbene transfer reactions reduce the risk of rapid accumulation of explosive diazo compounds and improve functional group compatibility and substrate scope. Given the growing importance of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones in chemical synthesis, a comprehensive review of this topic in the literature is essential to demonstrate their synthetic potential. In this review, we critically summarize and comprehensively analyze the publications in various literatures on the chemistry of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones starting from 1990 to date. The classification of the different reactivity profiles of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones and the efficiencies of similar types of reactions or substrates with fluoroalkyl diazo compounds are compared.

Comprehensive phytochemical analysis, other than gingerols and shogaols, has not yet been deeply investigated. Hence, the current research aimed to establish a non-targeted metabolomics approach for the discrimination between fresh ginger rhizome samples collected from four different producing countries, i.e., China, India, Pakistan, and Peru. In addition, lab-dried samples were analyzed to trace drying-induced metabolites. A comprehensive extraction procedure was carried out resulting in production of polar and non-polar fractions. The polar fraction was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Fourier transform tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-C18-FT-MS/MS) and gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) post derivatization. UPLC-C8-FT-MS/MS was used for analysis of non-polar fraction. Results revealed for identification of a total of 253 metabolites. In addition, multivariate data analysis (MVDA), including principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated clustering of Asian specimens. Several metabolites with a characteristic pattern for the origin revealing the highest contents of bioactive metabolites in the Peruvian product. Moreover, chemical markers identified, including [6]-gingerol and [6]-shogaol discriminating between fresh and dried samples. Furthermore, abundances of some primary metabolites, including amino acids and cinnamic acid, have confirmed the biosynthetic pathway of gingerols and their transformation upon drying to shogaols. The proposed approach can be applied as a potential candidate for quality assessment of ginger and other medicinal plants. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) during pregnancy has been suggested to be associated with adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes; however, the findings have been inconsistent. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overview of these associations. Methods: The online databases PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched comprehensively for eligible studies from inception to February 2021. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random- or fixed-effects models, and dose-response meta-analyses were also conducted when possible. Findings: A total of 29 studies (32,905 participants) were included. The pooled results demonstrated that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure during pregnancy was linearly associated with increased preterm birth risk (pooled OR per 1-ng/ml increase: 1.01, 95% CIs: 1.00–1.02, P = 0.009) and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) exposure showed inverted U-shaped associations with preterm birth risk (P values for the nonlinear trend: 0.025 and 0.030). Positive associations were also observed for exposure to perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) and miscarriage (pooled OR per 1-ng/ml increase: 1.87, 95% CIs: 1.15–3.03) and PFOS and preeclampsia (pooled OR per 1-log increase: 1.27, 95% CIs: 1.06–1.51), whereas exposure to perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA) was inversely associated with preeclampsia risk (pooled OR per 1-log increase: 0.81, 95% CIs: 0.71–0.93). Based on individual evidence, detrimental effects were observed between PFDA exposure and small for gestational age and between PFOA and PFOS and intrauterine growth restriction. No significant associations were found between pregnancy PFAS exposure and other adverse pregnancy outcomes (i.e., gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced hypertension, low birth weight, and large and small for gestational age). Interpretation: Our findings indicated that PFOS, PFOA and PFNA exposure during pregnancy might be associated with increased preterm birth risk and that PFAS exposure might be associated with the risk of miscarriage and preeclampsia. Due to the limited evidence obtained for most associations, additional studies are required to confirm these findings. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objectives: Perfluorobutane ultrasound contrast agent as a new type of contrast agent has a good performance in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aim to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of Perfluorobutane contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (P-CEUS) in the diagnosis of HCC with a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane, Clinical Key, Wan Fang, CBM and CNKI databases were systematically searched and checked for studies using P-CEUS in HCC, from 2007 to 2020. Data necessary to construct 2 × 2 contingency tables were extracted from included studies. The QUADAS tool was utilized to assess the methodologic quality of the studies. Meta-analysis included data pooling, subgroup analyses, meta-regression and investigation of publication bias was comprehensively performed. Results: Nine studies were included in this meta-analysis and the overall diagnostic accuracy in characterization of HCC was as follows: pooled sensitivity, 0.90 (95% confidence interval: 0.82–0.95); pooled specificity, 0.97 (0.93–0.98); pooled positive likelihood ratio, 27.2 (14.1 to − 52.3); and pooled negative likelihood ratio, 0.10 (0.06–0.18). The area under the comprehensive receiving operation characteristic curve was 0.98 (0.97–0.99). Conclusion: The sensitivity and specificity of P-CEUS are more valuable than other imaging techniques (such as computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging). However, due to the large differences in the data samples collected in this study, statistical heterogeneity results. P-CEUS can significantly improve the diagnostic efficiency of previous contrast-enhanced ultrasound for HCC.

abstract={In recent years, the consumption of synthetic cathinones has grown continuously as these drugs represent a more affordable and obtainable alternative to amphetamines. After consumption, cathinones have a stimulant effect and can be found in the human organism in their pure form or metabolized. As these compounds are difficult to monitor by routine drug screening it is very important to develop procedures capable of detecting and monitoring their consumption. Different strategies have been developed for the analysis of cathinones in biological matrices such as blood, hair or oral fluid. However, urine has been most widely used as the procedure is non-invasive and samples can be obtained in larger volumes than other biological matrices. The present review provides a critical discussion of the latest trends for the determination of cathinones in urine samples, focusing particularly on the use of chromatographic techniques, which is the approach most widely reported in the literature. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Intraocular liquids tamponade agents, such as perfluorocarbon liquids (PFCLs), semifluorinated alkanes (SFAs), silicone oils (SOs) and heavy silicone oils (HSOs), are a crucial intraoperative and/or postoperative tool in vitreoretinal surgery, in particular for the management of complex vitreoretinal diseases. However, their use is not without complications, which are potentially severe. Consequently, a growing interest has been devoted to the biocompatibility of these compounds and the adequacy of current regulations that should guarantee their safety. Obviously, an updated knowledge on research findings and potential risks associated to the use of intraocular liquid compounds is essential, not only for vitreoretinal surgeons, but also for any ophthalmologist involved in the management of patients receiving intraocular liquid tamponades. In light of this, the review provides a comprehensive characterisation of intraocular liquid tamponades, in terms of physical and chemical properties, current clinical use and possible complications. Moreover, this review focuses on the safety profile of these compounds, summarising the existing regulation and the available evidence on their biocompatibility. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.},

abstract={As emerging pollutants, microplastics (MPs) have been found globally in various freshwater and marine matrices. This study recompiled 270 endpoints of 3765 individuals from 43 publications, reporting the onset of enhanced biological performance and reduced oxidative stress biomarkers induced by MPs in aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations (≤1 mg/L, median = 0.1 mg/L). The stimulatory responses of consumption, growth, reproduction and survival ranged from 131% to 144% of the control, with a combined response of 136%. The overall inhibitory response of 9 oxidative stress biomarkers was 71% of the control, and commonly below 75%. The random-effects meta-regression indicated that the extents of MPs-induced responses were independent of habitat, MP composition, morphology, particle size and exposure duration. The results implied that the exposure to MPs at low and high concentrations might induce opposite/non-monotonic responses in aquatic biota. Correspondingly, the hormetic dose response relationships were found at various endpoints, such as reproduction, genotoxicity, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity and behavioral alteration. Hormesis offers a novel perspective for understanding the dose response mode of aquatic organisms exposed to low and high concentrations of MPs, highlighting the necessity to incorporate the hormetic dose response model into the ecological/environmental risk assessment of MPs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Per- or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a family of synthetic polyfluorinated compounds, are widely used in consumer products. Ubiquitous exposures to PFAS, in consideration of their persistence, bioaccumulation potential, and toxicities have led to concerns regarding possible harmful effects during critical periods of development in early-life and long-term consequences on health. The potential effects of PFAS depend on various factors including the type of PFAS and the timing and level of exposure. We performed a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature to assess the effects of early-life PFAS exposure on prenatal and postnatal growth, adiposity, and puberty in children and adolescents. For birth size, most studies indicated that prenatal PFAS exposure, in particular long-chain PFAS, may impair fetal growth, albeit some reports of null associations with maternal PFAS. For growth within 2 years of age, prenatal PFAS exposure showed no associations with height and either null or negative associations with weight. However, postnatal PFAS exposures were inversely related to height and weight at 2 years in a cross-sectional study. For postnatal adiposity, prenatal PFAS may mostly have negative associations with body mass index in the first 2 years of life, but positive relationships with adiposity in childhood and adolescence, although some studies showed null associations. For puberty, the evidence for associations between early-life PFAS exposure and pubertal development or sex hormone levels were limited and inconclusive. From experimental studies, plausible mechanisms through which PFAS may affect early-life growth and puberty include PFAS-induced activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, alterations of thyroid or steroid hormone synthesis and metabolism, and their weak estrogenic or anti-androgenic properties. Although the published literature suggests possible effects of PFAS exposures on early-life growth, adiposity, and puberty, current human evidence is limited in establishing PFAS-induced effects on early-life physical development. Further investigation is warranted to clarify PFAS-induced effects on growth and physical development in consideration of the critical time-window of exposure, concomitant exposure to chemical mixtures including various PFAS types, and possible non-monotonic dose-response relationship for growth and adiposity trajectories. © Copyright © 2021 Lee, Jung, Kim, Choi and Lee.},

abstract={Eroded particles from the source zone could transport a high concentration of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) to sediments and water bodies. Yet, the contribution of suspended particles has not been systematically reviewed. Analyzing reported studies, we quantitatively demonstrate that suspended particles in surface water can contain significantly higher concentrations of PFAAs than the sediment below, indicating the source of suspended particles are not the sediment but particles eroded and carried from the source zone upstream. The affinity of PFAAs to particles depends on the particle composition, including organic carbon fraction and iron or aluminum oxide content. In soils, most PFAAs are retained within the top 5 m below the ground surface. The distribution of PFAAs in the subsurface varies based on site properties and local weather conditions. The depth corresponding to the maximum concentration of PFAA in soil decreases with an increase in soil organic carbon or rainfall amount received in the catchment areas. We attribute a greater accumulation of PFAAs near the upper layer of the subsurface to an increase in the accumulation of particles eroded from source zones upstream receiving heavy rainfall. Precursor transformation in the aerobic zone is significantly higher than in the anaerobic zone, thereby making the aerobic subsurface zone serve as a long-term source of groundwater pollution. Collectively, these results suggest that suspended particles, often an overlooked vector for PFAAs, can be a dominant pathway for the transport of PFAAs in environments. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={In the last two decades, the interest in natural plant feed additives (PFA) as alternatives to synthetic vitamins in livestock nutrition has increased. After a systematic review, a total of 19 peer-reviewed papers published between 2000 and 2020 were retained to evaluate the antioxidant effects of PFA compared to synthetic antioxidant vitamins (mainly vitamin E; VitE) in livestock nutrition. These studies demonstrated that PFAs could be as efficient as VitE in counteracting oxidative stress in pigs, rabbits, and ruminants. However, PFAs only positively affected animals’ growth performance and feed efficiency in some monogastric studies. The PFA can affect antioxidant enzyme activity in a dose-and method of administration-dependent manner. The antioxidant capacity of both PFA and VitE were depressed in cows fed with diets rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Variability among studies could be related to species differences. Despite the interest of the feed industry sector in PFA, there are still very few studies evaluating their antioxidant effect in species other than poultry. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is one of the dominant perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) detected in aquatic ecosystems. It has been used in a wide range of industrial and consumer products for decades. The unique properties of PFOS, including its stability and resistance to degradation, have made it highly persistent in the aquatic environment. Because of its persistence, potential toxicity, and occurrence in aquatic ecosystems, interest in PFOS has increased in recent decades. Despite this interest, current information on the environmental distribution of PFOS in ambient surface waters of the United States is fairly limited. This critical review summarizes the currently available literature on PFOS occurrence in surface waters across the United States and highlights existing data gaps. Available data are largely from a handful of study areas with known PFAS manufacturing or industrial uses, with much of the data collected from freshwater systems in eastern states and the upper Midwest. Measured PFOS concentrations in surface waters vary widely, over 8 orders of magnitude, with the highest concentrations occurring downstream from manufacturing and industrial use plants, areas near aqueous film-forming foam–use sites, and sites where PFOS precursors were used in textile treatment. Non–point source–related occurrences are highest near urbanized areas with high population densities. Current data illustrate the occurrence of PFOS in surface waters across multiple US states. Additional data are needed to better understand PFOS occurrence in US aquatic ecosystems, particularly in estuarine and marine systems and where monitoring data are not available (e.g., southwestern, central, and western United States). Additional PFOS occurrence data would provide valuable information on potential spatial and temporal variability in surface waters and possible risks posed to aquatic ecosystems.

abstract={A Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) is recognized as a highly precise analytical instrument for analyzing the constituent elements of matter in the fields of physics, chemistry, aerospace, and so on. With the emergence and development of miniaturized and portable devices in numerous scientific and technological fields, there has been an urgent need for on-chip FTSs due to their benefits of small size, portability, low energy consumption, and robustness. However, the small size of on-chip FTSs hinders the acquisition of a large optical path difference, resulting in a low resolution of the spectrometer. In addition, the sampler spacing is not sufficiently small to satisfy Nyquist's sampling theorem, directly influencing the bandwidth of the spectrometer. Therefore, studies have been performed to investigate the trade-off between the reduced size and performance of spectrometers. This paper aims to systematically review the progress in on-chip FTSs, especially in on-chip static FTSs, including spatially modulated, temporally modulated, and space-time comodulated FTSs, from the aspects of theories, implementations, and performance indicators. Finally, the paper ends with a discussion of the challenges and a view of the prospective development of this exciting field. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

abstract={The Antarctic ecosystem represents a remote region far from point sources of pollution. Still, Antarctic marine predators, such as seabirds, are exposed to organohalogen contaminants (OHCs) which may induce adverse health effects. With increasing restrictions and regulations on OHCs, the levels and exposure are expected to decrease over time. We studied south polar skua (Catharacta maccormiciki), a top predator seabird, to compare OHC concentrations measured in whole blood from 2001/2002 and 2013/2014 in Dronning Maud Land. As a previous study found increasing organochlorine concentrations with sampling day during the 2001/2002 breeding season, suggesting dietary changes, we investigated if this increase was repeated in the 2013/2014 breeding season. In addition to organochlorines, we analyzed hydroxy-metabolites, brominated contaminants and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in 2013/2014, as well as dietary descriptors of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, to assess potential changes in diet during breeding. Lipid normalized concentrations of individual OHCs were 63%, 87% and 105% higher for hexachlorobenzene (HCB), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE), and ∑Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), respectively, in 2013/2014 compared to 2001/2002. South polar skuas males in 2013/2014 were in poorer body condition than in 2001/2002, and with higher pollutant levels. Poorer body condition may cause the remobilization of contaminants from stored body reserves, and continued exposure to legacy contaminants at overwintering areas may explain the unexpected higher OHC concentrations in 2013/2014 than 2001/2002. Concentrations of protein-associated PFAS increased with sampling day during the 2013/2014 breeding season, whereas the lipid-soluble chlorinated pesticides, PCBs and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs) showed no change. OHC occurrence was not correlated with stable isotopes. The PFAS biomagnification through the local food web at the colony should be investigated further. © 2021 The Author(s)},

Previous epidemiological studies suggest association of maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes, while evidences about the association are inconsistent. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the relationship of maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Twenty-one relevant studies were identified from three databases before 2020. The quality, heterogeneity and possibility of publication bias of included studies were evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, Q-statistic and Begg's test, respectively. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained by means of random-effects meta-analysis models. Meta-analysis results revealed that maternal exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) may have a positive association with preterm birth (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.38). The pooled estimates also showed limited evidence of association between maternal perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure and miscarriage (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 0.92, 2.38) with obvious heterogeneity (I2 = 93.9, p &lt; 0.01). However, no such significant associations were found between the other PFASs and miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth. In addition, the subgroup analyses showed that studies on the relationship of maternal PFASs exposure and miscarriage were mainly contributed by developed countries. The meta-analysis results indicated maternal exposure to PFOS can increase the risk of preterm birth. The results of the included studies are inconsistent and the effects of PFASs on human health are complex. Further studies with enough samples are required to verify these findings. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Water contamination by a variety of pollutants, such as conventional pollutants (e.g. heavy metals and organics) and emerging micropollutants (e.g. personal care products and endocrine disrupting compounds) is of great concern. Various technologies have been developed to address this critical challenge. Among them, adsorption by polyaniline (PANI)-based nanocomposites, has gained growing research interest recently due to their unique electrical characteristics and many other benefits, such as facile synthesis, low cost, excellent environmental stability, simple acid-base doping/dedoping process, reactive NH– groups, and tunable properties. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the typical PANI-based adsorbents and their properties. Moreover, the removal of various aqueous contaminants (including heavy metals and metalloids, organic dyes and emerging pollutants) by PANI-based adsorbents is discussed and assessed. The unique doping/dedoping of PANI-based adsorbents alters the morphology, pore size, surface charge and functional groups of the adsorbents, leading to enhanced adsorbent-adsorbate interactions and thus adsorption performance. The adsorption mechanisms of aqueous pollutants by PANI-based adsorbents include electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, π–π interactions, hydrogen bonding, chelating and/or complexation effects. Finally, the future outlooks on aqueous pollutants removal by PANI-based adsorbents are presented. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Early-life exposure to widespread environmental toxicants including organic pollutants (OPs), heavy metals, and air pollutants is detrimental to human health. The immunotoxicity of these environmental toxicants are well acknowledged and a few studies have focused on the relationship between environmental toxicant exposure and vaccine antibody potency or immunoglobulin (Ig) levels in children. Altered antibody titers or Ig levels in post-vaccination children were correlated with these environmental exposures; however, the effects of environmental toxicants on post-vaccination antibody potency or Ig levels in children have not been summarized. The objectives of this systematic review are therefore 1) to summarize the current studies concerning the associations of early-life exposure to environmental toxicants with vaccine antibody potency or Ig levels in children; and 2) to analyze the possible mechanisms underlying exposure-related alterations of antibody titers or Ig levels against different vaccines. We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database for relevant literature with the key terms and included articles up to September 30, 2020. Based on the eligibility criteria, 28 articles were selected. These studies investigated the associations of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (5 studies), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) (6 studies), other OPs (4 studies), heavy metals (11 studies) and air pollutants, e.g. PM2.5, (3 studies) with the serum-specific antibody concentrations or Ig levels against different vaccines, such as anti-Hib, tetanus, diphtheria toxoid, IgA, IgE, etc. These studies suggest that exposure to these toxicants is generally associated with decreased potency of antibodies produced from childhood immunizations and overall deficiency in vaccines' provided protection. This systematic review provides evidence that exposure-induced changes to humoral immune-related tissue/cells/molecules response to vaccines may play predominant roles in the inverse associations between antibody responsiveness to vaccines and environmental toxicants. This review could thus also help us to conduct better immunization policies for children under environmental toxicant burdens. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The goal of this study was three-fold: (1) to analyze 590 matched maternal and cord blood samples (total 295 pairs) using non-targeted analysis (NTA); (2) to examine the differences in chemical abundance between maternal and cord blood samples; and (3) to examine the associations between exogenous chemicals and endogenous metabolites. We analyzed all samples with high-resolution mass spectrometry using liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS) in both positive and negative electrospray ionization modes (ESI+ and ESI-) and in soft ionization (MS) and fragmentation (MS/MS) modes for prioritized features. We confirmed 19 unique compounds with analytical standards, we tentatively identified 73 compounds with MS/MS spectra matching, and we annotated 98 compounds using an annotation algorithm. We observed 103 significant associations in maternal and 128 in cord samples between compounds annotated as endogenous and compounds annotated as exogenous. An example of these relationships was an association between three poly and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and endogenous fatty acids in both the maternal and cord samples indicating potential interactions between PFASs and fatty acid regulating proteins. © 2021 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Water quality management will be a priority issue in the near future. Indeed, due to scarcity and/or contamination of the water, regulatory frameworks will be increasingly strict to reduce environmental impacts of wastewater and to allow water to be reused. Moreover, drinking water quality standards must be improved in order to account for the emerging pollutants that are being detected in tap water. These tasks can only be achieved if new improved and sustainable water treatment technologies are developed. Nanomaterials are improving the ongoing research on advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). This work reviews the most important AOPs, namely: persulfate, chlorine and NH2Cl based processes, UV/H2O2, Fenton processes, ozone, and heterogeneous photocatalytic processes. A critical review of the current coupling of nanomaterials to some of these AOPs is presented. Besides the active role of the nanomaterials in the degradation of water contaminants/pollutants in the AOPs, the relevance of their adsorbent/absorbent function in these processes is also discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are non‐biodegradable synthetic chemical compounds that are widely used in manufacturing many household products. Many studies have reported the association between PFCs exposure with the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, those reports are still debatable, due to their findings. Thus, this review paper aimed to analyse the association of PFCs compound with CVDs and their risk factors in humans by systematic review and meta‐analysis. Google Scholar, PubMed and ScienceDirect were searched for PFCs studies on CVDs and their risk from 2009 until present. The association of PFCs exposure with the prevalence of CVDs and their risk factors were assessed by calculating the quality criteria, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). CVDs risk factors were divided into serum lipid profile (main risk factor) and other known risk factors. The meta‐analysis was then used to derive a combined OR test for heterogeneity in findings between studies. Twenty‐nine articles were included. Our meta‐analysis indicated that PFCs exposure could be associated with CVDs (Test for overall effect: z= 2.2, p = 0.02; Test for heterogeneity: I2 = 91.6%, CI = 0.92–1.58, p &lt; 0.0001) and their risk factors (Test for overall effect: z= 4.03, p &lt; 0.0001; Test for heterogeneity: I2 = 85.8%, CI = 1.00– 1.14, p &lt; 0.0001). In serum lipids, total cholesterol levels are frequently reported associated with the exposure of PFCs. Among PFCs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) exposure increased the risk of CVDs than other types of PFCs. Although the risk of PFOA and PFOS were positively associated with CVDs and their risk factors, more observational studies shall be carried out to identify the long‐term effects of these contaminants in premature CVDs development in patients. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Background: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of posterior fossa decompression (PFD), posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty (PFDD), and posterior fossa decompression with resection of tonsils (PFDRT) in Chiari malformation type I (CMI). Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the evidence supporting the efficacy of filum terminale sectioning (FTS), syringosubarachnoid shunting (SSS), and syringoperitoneal shunting (SPS) in CMI. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases were screened for English-language studies published from inception until August 11, 2020. A total of 3593 studies were identified through the searching process. Fifteen cohort studies were included in the systematic review and network meta-analysis. Results: No studies concerning FTS, SSS, and SPS were found eligible. Therefore, only PFD, PFDD, and PFDRT were compared. PFDD showed significantly higher incidence of complications (relative risk [RR], 3.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.54–5.64) cerebrospinal fluid leak (RR, 9.74; 95% CI, 2.33–40.78) and neurologic deficit (RR, 8.76; 95% CI, 2.08–36.90) than did PFD. Both PFDD and PFDRT achieved higher syringomyelia improvement (RR, 1.23, 95% CI, 1.09–1.39 and RR, 1.32, 95% CI, 1.15–1.51, respectively) and greater clinical improvement (RR, 1.24, 95% CI, 1.10–1.39 and RR, 1.24, 95% CI, 1.08–1.44, respectively) than did PFD. No differences were found between PFDD and PFDRT. Conclusions: PFDD and PFDRT are superior to PFD, especially in patients with syringomyelia-Chiari complex, because of greater syringomyelia reduction and better clinical improvement. However, PFDD and PFDRT can be considered equally efficient. There is no evidence pleading in favor of SFT, SSS, and SPS over any PFD technique. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={Vitreo-retinal disorders constitute a significant portion of treatable ocular diseases. These pathologies often require vitreo-retinal surgery and, as a consequence, the use of vitreous substitutes. Nowadays, the vitreous substitutes that are used in clinical practice are mainly divided into gases (air, SF6, C2F6, C3F8) and liquids (perfluorocarbon liquids, silicone oils, and heavy silicone oils). There are specific advantages and drawbacks to each of these, which determine their clinical indications. However, developing the ideal biomaterial for vitreous substitution continues to be one of the most important challenges in ophthalmology, and a multidisciplinary approach is required. In this sense, recent research has focused on the development of biocompatible, biodegradable, and injectable hydrogels (natural, synthetic, and smart), which also act as medium and long-term internal tamponade agents. This comprehensive review aims to cover the main characteristics and indications for use of the extensive range of vitreous substitutes that are currently used in clinical practice, before going on to describe the hydrogels that have been developed recently and which have emerged as promising biomaterials for vitreous substitution. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Background and Objective: The growing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the urgency of identifying individuals most at risk of infection. Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are manufactured fluorinated chemicals widely used in many industrial and household products. The objective of this case-control study was to assess the association between PFASs exposure and COVID-19 susceptibility and to elucidate the metabolic dysregulation associated with PFASs exposure in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Total 160 subjects (80 COVID-19 patients and 80 symptom-free controls) were recruited from Shanxi and Shandong provinces, two regions heavily polluted by PFASs in China. Twelve common PFASs were quantified in both urine and serum. Urine metabolome profiling was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: In unadjusted models, the risk of COVID-19 infection was positively associated with urinary levels of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (Odds ratio: 2.29 [95% CI: 1.52–3.22]), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (2.91, [1.95–4.83], and total PFASs (∑ (12) PFASs) (3.31, [2.05–4.65]). After controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), the associations remained statistically significant (Adjusted odds ratio of 1.94 [95% CI: 1.39–2.96] for PFOS, 2.73 [1.71–4.55] for PFOA, and 2.82 [1.97–3.51] for ∑ (12) PFASs). Urine metabolome-PFASs association analysis revealed that 59% of PFASs-associated urinary endogenous metabolites in COVID-19 patients were identified to be produced or largely regulated by mitochondrial function. In addition, the increase of PFASs exposure was associated with the accumulation of key metabolites in kynurenine metabolism, which are involved in immune responses (Combined β coefficient of 0.60 [95% CI: 0.25–0.95, P = 0.001]). Moreover, alternations in PFASs-associated metabolites in mitochondrial and kynurenine metabolism were also correlated with clinical lab biomarkers for mitochondrial function (serum growth/differentiation factor-15) and immune activity (lymphocyte percentage), respectively. Conclusion: Elevated exposure to PFASs was independently associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. PFASs-associated metabolites were implicated in mitochondrial function and immune activity. Larger studies are needed to confirm our findings and further understand the underlying mechanisms of PFASs exposure in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of compounds that have become environmental contaminants of emerging concern. They are highly persistent, toxic, bioaccumulative, and ubiquitous which makes them important to detect to ensure environmental and human health. Multiple instrument-based methods exist for sensitive and selective detection of PFAS in a variety of matrices, but these methods suffer from expensive costs and the need for a laboratory and highly trained personnel. There is a big need for fast, inexpensive, robust, and portable methods to detect PFAS in the field. This would allow environmental laboratories and other agencies to perform more frequent testing to comply with regulations. In addition, the general public would benefit from a fast method to evaluate the drinking water in their homes for PFAS contamination. A PFAS sensor would provide almost real-time data on PFAS concentrations that can also provide actionable information for water quality managers and consumers around the planet. In this review, we discuss the sensors that have been developed up to this point for PFAS detection by their molecular detection mechanism as well as the goals that should be considered during sensor development. Future research needs and commercialization challenges are also highlighted. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objective: These days, the gold standard procedure for otosclerosis treatment is stapes surgery. The endoscopic approach of the procedure is gaining popularity as endoscopic ear surgery develops across the globe. The main objective of this study is to gather and compile well-documented and reliable data regarding surgical outcomes for the endoscopic approach to stapes surgery up to this date. Materials and methods: Publications in English were searched in the PUBMED/MEDLINE database and were systematically reviewed. A total of 16 articles were reviewed according to the inclusion criteria, obtaining a total of 573 patients managed surgically for otosclerosis, using an endoscopic approach. Data were systematically extracted and compared across variables. Results: Data were obtained as follows: mean age of 43 years; female proportion of 60%; 3 mm endoscope diameter of 51%, 4 mm of 39%; titanium piston-type prostheses of 52% and Teflon of 48%; length of the prosthesis (mode) was 4.5 mm; 0.6 mm diameter of the piston of 81% and 0.4 mm of 19%; mean surgical time was 55 min. Hearing results, mean preoperative air–bone gap (ABG) 31 dB; mean postoperative ABG 9 dB; ABG improvement of 22 dB; an ABG closure rate to 20 dB or less of 92% and an ABG closure rate to 10 dB or less of 77%. Complication rates: intraoperative tympanic membrane perforation of 5%; postoperative vertigo of 11%; postoperative dysgeusia of 10%; reported a postoperative neurosensorial hearing loss of 0.2%; reported gusher phenomenon of one case (0.2%). Conclusion: Endoscopic stapes surgery is completely achievable using 0º angle and 4-mm-diameter sinus surgery endoscope. Instrument availability should not be an obstacle to the development of this type of surgery in any otolaryngology department. Audiological outcomes are comparable to microscopic approaches. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Obesity is a major public health concern at the origin of many pathologies, including cancers. Among them, the incidence of gastro-intestinal tract cancers is significantly increased, as well as the one of hormone-dependent cancers. The metabolic changes caused by overweight mainly with the development of adipose tissue (AT), insulin resistance and chronic inflammation induce hormonal and/or growth factor imbalances, which impact cell proliferation and differentiation. AT is now considered as the main internal source of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) representing a low level systemic chronic exposure. Some EDCs are non-metabolizable and can accumulate in AT for a long time. We are chronically exposed to low doses of EDCs able to interfere with the endocrine metabolism of the body. Importantly, several EDCs have been involved in the genesis of obesity affecting profoundly the physiology of AT. In parallel, EDCs have been implicated in the development of cancers, in particular hormone-dependent cancers (prostate, testis, breast, endometrium, thyroid). While it is now well established that AT secretes adipocytokines that promote tumor progression, it is less clear whether they can initiate cancer. Therefore, it is important to better understand the effects of EDCs, and to investigate the buffering effect of AT in the context of progression but also initiation of cancer cells using adequate models recommended to uncover and validate these mechanisms for humans. We will review and argument here the potential role of AT as a crosstalk between EDCs and hormone-dependent cancer development, and how to assess it. © Copyright © 2021 Bokobza, Hinault, Tiroille, Clavel, Bost and Chevalier.},

abstract={A key gap in the literature on the treatment of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in impacted water is the absence of a review article dedicated to anion exchange resin (AER) treatment. This gap is important because previous research has consistently shown adsorption by AER to be one of the most effective treatment processes for PFAS removal from impacted water, and AER is one of the most commonly deployed technologies in the field. Given the scope of the previous review articles on PFAS removal by various adsorbent types, the sections on AER do not explore the full depth of PFAS and AER interactions nor cover the breadth of AER testing conditions. Accordingly, the goal of this paper was to critically review the available peer-reviewed literature on PFAS removal from water by AER. The specific objectives of the review were to synthesize the previous literature results on (1) batch adsorption behavior, (2) impact of water chemistry conditions, (3) continuous-flow adsorption, (4) adsorption modeling, (5) regeneration, and (6) weak-base AER. Following from critical review of the literature, the future research priorities discussed include: (i) improving the underlying science that governs PFAS–resin interactions, (ii) improving methods for resin regeneration and management of PFAS-contaminated concentrate streams, and (iii) comparative life cycle environmental and economic analyses for ion exchange treatment systems relative to competing technologies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Iron carbides are of burgeoning interest in both fundamental scientific research and fuel technology due to their electronic, magnetic, and catalytic properties. They are arguably connected with the active phase in iron-based Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS). In FTS, different phases of iron carbide have been identified, including Hägg carbide (χ-Fe5C2), pseudo-hexagonal iron carbide (ἐ-Fe2.2C), hexagonal iron carbide (ɛ-Fe3C), cementite (θ-Fe3C), and Eckstrom-Adcock iron carbide (Fe7C3). However, despite decades of existence of FTS technology, the exact roles played by carbide phases have been the subject of intense debate due to the complex and dynamic nature of carbide phases. This drawback usually frustrates the establishment of a clear-cut structure-perfomance relationship. In light of these concerns, it is very imperative to critically review the challenges and various approaches aimed at demystifying their roles and improving their performance in FTS for sustainable production of clean fuels. First, the structures and essential properties of iron carbides were evaluated and recent research advances in the synthesis of iron carbides were discussed and compared. Second, the structural elucidations of carbide phases using in situ studies, their performances and thermodynamic stability in FT reaction were discussed. Finally, outlooks on future research directions are outlined. This review provides insights into understanding the evolution and performance of carbide phases in FTS, and motivating researchers to further contribute towards designing iron-based FTS catalysts with highly active and selective carbide phase as the predominant phase. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges were filled with CXs and tested for extraction of metaflumizone and other seven environmental micropollutants (acetamiprid, atrazine, isoproturon, methiocarb, carbamazepine, diclofenac, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) before chromatographic analysis. The recoveries obtained with the pristine CX were low for most analytes, except for metaflumizone (69 ± 5%). Moreover, it was concluded that the adsorption/desorption process of the micropollutants performed better on CXs with a less acidic surface (i.e., pristine CX). Thus, cartridges were prepared with pristine CX and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in a multi-layer configuration. This reusable cartridge was able to simultaneously extract the eight micropollutants and was used to validate an analytical methodology based on SPE followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A widespread occurrence of 6/8 target compounds was observed in surface water collected in rivers supplying three drinking water treatment plants and in the resulting drinking water at the endpoint of each distribution system. Therefore, the first study employing CXs and MWCNTs as sorbent in multi-layer SPE cartridges is herein reported as a proof of concept for determination of multi-class water micropollutants.},

abstract={Industrial effluents contain several organic and inorganic contaminants. Among others, dyes and heavy metals introduce a serious threat to drinking waterbodies. These pollutants can be noxious or carcinogenic in nature, and harmful to humans and different aquatic species. Therefore, it is of high importance to remove heavy metals and dyes to reduce their environmental toxicity. This has led to an extensive research for the development of novel materials and techniques for the removal of heavy metals and dyes. One route to the removal of these pollutants is the utilization of magnetic carbon nanotubes (CNT) as adsorbents. Magnetic carbon nanotubes hold remarkable properties such as surface-volume ratio, higher surface area, convenient separation methods, etc. The suitable characteristics of magnetic carbon nanotubes have led them to an extensive search for their utilization in water purification. Along with magnetic carbon nanotubes, the buckypaper (BP) membranes are also favorable due to their unique strength, high porosity, and adsorption capability. However, BP membranes are mostly used for salt removal from the aqueous phase and limited literature shows their applications for removal of heavy metals and dyes. This study focuses on the existence of heavy metal ions and dyes in the aquatic environment, and methods for their removal. Various fabrication approaches for the development of magnetic-CNTs and CNT-based BP membranes are also discussed. With the remarkable separation performance and ultra-high-water flux, magnetic-CNTs, and CNT-based BP membranes have a great potential to be the leading technologies for water treatment in future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Thousands of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with diverse structures have been detected in the ambient environment. Apart from a few well-studied PFAS, the structure-related toxicokinetics of a broader set of PFAS remain unclear. Objectives: To understand the toxicokinetics of PFAS, we attempted to characterize the metabolism pathways of 74 structurally diverse PFAS samples from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s PFAS screening library. Methods: Using the early life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model, we determined the bioconcentration factors and phenotypic toxicities of 74 PFAS. Then, we applied high-resolution mass spectrometry-based nontargeted analysis to identify metabolites of PFAS in zebrafish larvae after 5 d of exposure by incorporating retention time and mass spectra. In vitro enzymatic activity experiments with human recombinant liver carboxylesterase (hCES1) were employed to validate the structure-related hydrolysis of 11 selected PFAS. Results: Our findings identified five structural categories of PFAS prone to metabolism. The metabolism pathways of PFAS were highly related to their structures as exemplified by fluorotelomer alcohols that the predominance of β-oxidation or taurine conjugation pathways were primarily determined by the number of hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis was identified as a major metabolism pathway for diverse PFAS, and perfluoroalkyl carboxamides showed the highest in vivo hydrolysis rates, followed by carboxyesters and sulfonamides. The hydrolysis of PFAS was verified with recombinant hCES1, with strong substrate preferences toward perfluoroalkyl carboxamides. Conclusions: We suggest that the roadmap of the structure-related metabolism pathways of PFAS established in this study would provide a starting point to inform the potential health risks of other PFAS. © 2021, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

abstract={Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still a world-class challenge. Inflammation, especially its severe form with excess release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm) which is a life-threatening condition, is among the most important suspects involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis. It has been shown that cytokine storm could cause notable morbidities such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which leads to hypoxia which is significantly associated with mortality of patients with COVID-19. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) which activates following ARDS-induced hypoxia plays a crucial role in pathogenesis of cytokine storm. The expression of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1 β (IL-1β), and IL-6 which are key elements of cytokine storm are by nuclear factor κβ (NFκB). Interestingly, during the hypoxia, HIF-1α activates NFκB to induce expression of pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory factors. These released factors starts a autocrine/paracrine loop and causes deterioration of their etiological pathways of expression: cytokine storm and ARDS. To sum up, it seems HIF-1α is an important target to hit to ameliorate the mentioned pathways. Herein, we suggest perfluorocarbons (PFCs) which are among the organofluorine compounds as a possible co-treatment to reduce hypoxemia and then hypoxia. These substances are known for their high gas solving potential that make them able to be used as a synthetic artificial blood product. Due to the potential of PFCs to affect the fountain of important physiopathological pathway such as inflammation a hypoxia through affecting NFκB, they could be considered as multi-target co-treatment for ARD individuals with COVID-19. It is highly suggested to evaluate this hypothesis in following researches. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) comprise more than 4,000 anthropogenically manufactured compounds with widescale consumer and industrial applications. This critical review compiles the latest information on the worldwide distribution of PFAS and evaluates their fate in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). A large proportion (>30%) of monitoring studies in WWTPs were conducted in China, followed by Europe (30%) and North America (16%), whereas information is generally lacking for other parts of the world, including most of the developing countries. Short and long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) were widely detected in both the influents (up to 1,000 ng/L) and effluents (15 to >1,500 ng/L) of WWTPs. To date, limited data is available regarding levels of PFAS precursors and ultra-short chain PFAS in WWTPs. Most WWTPs exhibited low removal efficiencies for PFAS, and many studies reported an increase in the levels of PFAAs after wastewater treatment. The analysis of the fate of various classes of PFAS at different wastewater treatment stages (aerobic and/aerobic biodegradation, photodegradation, and chemical degradation) revealed biodegradation as the primary mechanism responsible for the transformation of PFAS precursors to PFAAs in WWTPs. Remediation studies at full scale and laboratory scale suggest advanced processes such as adsorption using ion exchange resins, electrochemical degradation, and nanofiltration are more effective in removing PFAS (~95–100%) than conventional processes. However, the applicability of such treatments for real-world WWTPs faces significant challenges due to the scaling-up requirements, mass-transfer limitations, and management of treatment by-products and wastes. Combining more than one technique for effective removal of PFAS, while addressing limitations of the individual treatments, could be beneficial. Considering environmental concentrations of PFAS, cost-effectiveness, and ease of operation, nanofiltration followed by adsorption using wood-derived biochar and/or activated carbons could be a viable option if introduced to conventional treatment systems. However, the large-scale applicability of the same needs to be further verified. © 2021},

abstract={Perfluoropolyethers, also known as ether-PFAS, are linear or branched alkyl ether polymers, where the substituent hydrogens on the carbon atoms in the chain have been fully replaced by fluorine atoms. Some of these molecules may have a carboxylate functional group attached to one of the terminal carbon atoms to form an ether-PFAS carboxylate. Perfluoropolyethers are used as processing aids in the manufacture of various types of perfluorinated polymeric materials which are used in a variety of consumer applications. Although the physicochemical and toxicological properties of certain perfluoropolyether compounds have been extensively studied, data are relatively sparse for some members of this class of compounds. Moreover, the physicochemical, toxicokinetic, and toxicological properties of ether-PFAS as a class have not been elucidated in previous comprehensive review articles. This article reviews the nomenclature and uses of ether-PFAS and compares the physicochemical properties, toxicokinetic characteristics, apical effects in toxicological studies, and dose-response profiles across four specific ether-PFAS compounds. This comparison, including a description of identified data gaps should help to inform the design of studies to further elucidate the characteristics of ether-PFAS and to propose potential read-across assessment strategies for members of this class. © 2021},

abstract={Background: Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) for isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (OA) remains controversial due to variable postoperative outcomes and high failure rates. Second-generation (2G) onlay prostheses have been associated with improved postoperative outcomes. This systematic review was performed to assess the current overall survivorship and functional outcomes of 2G PFA. Methods: A search was performed using PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Thirty-three studies published in the last 15 years (2005-2020) were included; of these 22 studies reported patient-reported outcome measures. Operative and nonoperative complications were analyzed. Pooled statistical analysis was performed for survivorship and functional scores using Excel 2016 and Stata 13. Results: The mean age of the patients was 59.7. When analyzing all studies, weighted survival at mean follow-up of 5.52 was 87.72%. Subanalysis of studies with minimum 5 years of follow up showed a survival of 94.24%. Fifteen studies reported Oxford Knee Score with a weighted mean postoperative Oxford Knee Score of 33.59. Mean American Knee Society Score pain was 79.7 while mean American Knee Society Score function was 79.3. The most common operative complication was OA progression for all implants. The percentage of revisions and conversions reported after analyzing all studies was 1.37% and 7.82% respectively. Conclusion: Safe and acceptable results of functional outcomes and PFA survivorship can result from 2G PFAs at both short and mid-term follow-up for patients with isolated patellofemoral OA. However, long-term follow-up outcomes are still pending for the newer implants. More extensive studies using standardized functional outcomes and long-term cost benefits should be evaluated. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

The following databases, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Google Scholar, and African Journals OnLine (AJOL) were searched to identify studies on pollutants of emerging concerns in Nigeria. A total of 933 articles were identified out of which 30 articles were selected to be eligible for the study. Over 250 emerging pollutants were identified and divided into 9 major groups which are personal care products, pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, pesticides, mycotoxins, radionuclides and electromagnetic radiations (Gamma radiation) and other pollutants of emerging concerns such as microbes, microplastics, and particulate matter. These pollutants are found in water bodies and underground waters, soils and sediments, biological systems, and ambient air at different concentrations with seasonal variations. Some of these pollutants act as endocrine disruptors, β-adrenergic receptors agonist blockers, oxidative stress inducers and can cause genetic alterations in DNA and epigenetic reprogramming through global DNA methylation, gene-specific CpG methylation and microRNA expression. Emerging pollutants of public health concern in Nigeria are on the increase and are threat to both ecological and human health. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A major and growing concern within society is the lack of innovative and effective solutions to mitigate the challenge of environmental pollution. Uncontrolled release of pollutants into the environment as a result of urbanisation and industrialisation is a staggering problem of global concern. Although, the eco-toxicity of nanotechnology is still an issue of debate, however, nanoremediation is a promising emerging technology to tackle environmental contamination, especially dealing with recalcitrant contaminants. Nanoremediation represents an innovative approach for safe and sustainable remediation of persistent organic compounds such as pesticides, chlorinated solvents, brominated or halogenated chemicals, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and heavy metals. This comprehensive review article provides a critical outlook on the recent advances and future perspectives of nanoremediation technologies such as photocatalysis, nano-sensing etc., applied for environmental decontamination. Moreover, sustainability assessment of nanoremediation technologies was taken into consideration for tackling legacy contamination with special focus on health and environmental impacts. The review further outlines the ecological implications of nanotechnology and provides consensus recommendations on the use of nanotechnology for a better present and sustainable future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Introduction and hypothesis: In recent years the number of caesarean sections has increased worldwide for different reasons. to review the scientific evidence relating to the impact of the type of delivery on pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) such as urinary and faecal incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. Methods: A review of systematic reviews and meta-analysis, drawn from the following databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library and LILACS (Literatura Latinoamericana y del Caribe en Ciencias de la Salud/Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) prior to January 2019. The directives of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses were used in assessing article quality. Results: Eleven systematic reviews were evaluated, 6 of which found a significantly decreased risk of urinary incontinence associated with caesarean section and 3 meta-analyses showed a significant reduction in POP for caesarean section, compared with vaginal delivery. Of 5 reviews that examined delivery type and faecal incontinence, only one indicated a lower incidence of faecal incontinence associated with caesarean delivery. However, most of the studies included in these reviews were not adjusted for important confounding factors and the risk of PFDs was not analysed by category of caesarean delivery (elective or urgent). Conclusion: When compared with vaginal delivery, caesarean is associated with a reduced risk of urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. These results should be interpreted with caution and do not help to address the question of whether elective caesareans are protective of the maternal pelvic floor. © 2020, The International Urogynecological Association.},

Co and Ni K-edge XAS data have been collected on 0.1 mol L-1Co(Tf2N)2and Ni(Tf2N)2solutions and on the metallic salts. MD simulations have been carried out to obtain structural information on the metal ion coordination. The analysis of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of the solutions has been carried out based on the atomistic description provided by MD, and the studied ILs have been found to be able to dissolve both the Co(Tf2N)2and Ni(Tf2N)2salts giving rise to a different structural arrangement around the metal ions as compared to the solid state. The combined EXAFS and MD results showed that the Co2+and Ni2+ions are surrounded by a first solvation shell formed by six [Tf2N]−anions, each coordinating in a monodentate fashion by means of the oxygen atoms. The nature of the IL organic cation has little or no influence on the overall spatial arrangement of the [Tf2N]−anions, so that stable octahedral complexes of the type [M(Tf2N)6]4-(M = Co, Ni) have been observed in all the investigated ILs. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Bioaccessibility/bioavailability (bioac-bioav) is an important criterion in the risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), especially in the restoration of contaminated sites. Although, the bioac-bioav concept is widely employed in PAH risk assessment for both humans and wildlife, their growth and integration in risk assessment models are seldom discussed. Consequently, the relevant literature listed on Web of Science (WOS)™ was retrieved and analyzed using the bibliometric software Citespace in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of this issue. Due to the limitations of the literature search software, we manually searched the articles about PAHs bioac-bioav that were published before 2000. This stage focuses on research on the distribution coefficient of PAHs between different environmental phases and laid the foundation for the adsorption-desorption of PAHs in subsequent studies of the bioac-bioav of PAHs. The research progress on PAH bioac-bioav from 2000 to the present was evaluated using the Citespace software based on country- and discipline-wise publication volumes and research hotspots. The development stages of PAH bioac-bioav after 2000 were divided into four time segments. The first three segments (2000–2005, 2006–2010, and 2011–2015) focused on the degradation of PAHs and their in vivo (bioavailability)-in vitro (bioaccessibility) evaluation method and risk assessment. Meanwhile, the current (2016–present) research focuses on the establishment of analytical methods for assessing PAH derivatives at environmental concentrations and the optimization of various in vitro digestion methods, including chemical optimization (sorptive sink) and biological optimization (Caco-2 cell). The contents are aimed at supplying researchers with a deeper understanding of the development of PAH bioac-bioav. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

We critically reviewed current evidence from human epidemiological, in vitro, and animal studies, including mammalian and aquatic model organisms. Epidemiological studies identified the associations between perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure and epigenetic changes in both adult populations and birth cohorts. For in vitro studies, various cell types including neuroblasts, preadipocytes, and hepatocytes have been employed to understand epigenetic effects of PFAS. In studies with animal models, effects of early life exposure to PFAS have been examined using rodent models, and aquatic models (e.g., zebrafish) have been more frequently used in recent years. Several studies highlighted oxidative stress as a key mediator between epigenetic modification and health effects. Collectively, previous research clearly suggest involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in PFAS induced toxicity, though these efforts have primarily focused on specific PFASs (i.e. mainly PFOS and PFOA) or endpoints (i.e. cancer). Additional studies are necessary to define specific linkages among epigenetic mechanisms and related biomarkers or phenotypical changes. In addition, future research is also needed for understudied PFAS and complex mixtures. Studies of epigenetic effects elicited by individual PFAS and mixtures are needed within an adverse outcome pathways framework, which will advance an understanding of PFAS risks to public health and the environment, and support efforts to design less hazardous chemicals. © 2021 Elsevier LtdPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) can elicit epigenetic alterations, yet available evidence is limited to a few commonly studied compounds.

In addition, several novel ARGs detection methods are critically reviewed. Notably, to ensure greater applicability of these technologies, systematic information on how recent technologies impact the ARGs removal and control are comprehensively compared and summarized. Finally, future research directions to alleviate the risk of ARGs in aquatic environment are briefly introduced.

The methodology used was a systematic review. The chemical contaminants quantified were evaluated according to Brazilian drinking-water standards, and Guideline Values were proposed for emerging pollutants using conservative endpoints from NOAEL and LOAEL available in literature. From 1351 articles evaluated, 15 reached the research goal. Seventy-seven parameters were quantified in Brazilian drinking water from underground, surface and rainwater sources. Soil composition, mining, sewage and agricultural activities were the main sources for the seven classes framed: pesticides, metals, organic, endocrine disruptors, drugs, personal care products and illicit drugs. Twenty-two parameters are listed in the current Brazilian drinking water quality standard and 54 are not. Water was not considered appropriate to drink due to cadmium, aluminum, iron, nickel, mercury, atrazine, propionaldehyde, beryllium, acetone and 17 α-ethinyl estradiol (carcinogenic). Measures to reduce chemical contamination in drinking water need to be taken such as the expansion of sewage treatment and upgrading to tertiary treatment, and controlling and reducing the application of pesticides. © 2021 IWA Publishing.

abstract={Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the leading platform for the production of biopharmaceuticals with human-like glycosylation. The standard practice for cell line generation relies on trial and error approaches such as adaptive evolution and high-throughput screening, which typically take several months. Metabolic modeling could aid in designing better producer cell lines and thus shorten development times. The genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) of CHO can accurately predict growth rates. However, in order to predict rational engineering strategies it also needs to accurately predict intracellular fluxes. In this work we evaluated the agreement between the fluxes predicted by parsimonious flux balance analysis (pFBA) using the CHO GSMM and a wide range of 13C metabolic flux data from literature. While glycolytic fluxes were predicted relatively well, the fluxes of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were vastly underestimated due to too low energy demand. Inclusion of computationally estimated maintenance energy significantly improved the overall accuracy of intracellular flux predictions. Maintenance energy was therefore determined experimentally by running continuous cultures at different growth rates and evaluating their respective energy consumption. The experimentally and computationally determined maintenance energy were in good agreement. Additionally, we compared alternative objective functions (minimization of uptake rates of seven nonessential metabolites) to the biomass objective. While the predictions of the uptake rates were quite inaccurate for most objectives, the predictions of the intracellular fluxes were comparable to the biomass objective function.

abstract={The extensive application of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has led to their widespread occurrence in a natural aquatic environment. Global health crisis is associated with the fast development of antimicrobial resistance, as more and more infectious diseases cannot be treated more than once. Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin are the most commonly detected antibiotics in water systems worldwide. The persistent and toxic nature of these antibiotics makes their elimination by conventional treatment methods at wastewater treatment plants almost impossible. The application of advanced oxidation processes and heterogeneous photocatalysis over TiO2‐based materials is a promising solution. This highly efficient technology has the potential to be sustainable, cost‐efficient and energy‐efficient. A comprehensive review on the application of various TiO2‐based photocatalysts for the degradation of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin is focused on highlighting their photocatalytic performance under various reaction conditions (different amounts of pollutant and photocatalyst, pH, light source, reaction media, presence of inorganic ions, natural organic matter, oxidants). Mineralization efficiency and ecotoxicity of final products have been also considered. Further research needs have been presented based on the literature findings. Among them, design and development of highly efficient under sunlight, stable, recyclable and cost‐effective TiO2‐based materials; usage of real wastewaters for photocata-lytic tests; and compulsory assessment of products ecotoxicity are the most important research tasks in order to meet requirements for industrial application. © 2021 by the authors.

This is the first study to fingerprint the contaminant profiles and bacterial communities present in plastic-associated inorganic and organic matter (PIOM) isolated from 10 year-aged plastic. Plastic sleeves were sampled from an oyster aquaculture farm and the PIOM was isolated from the intertidal, subtidal, and sediment-buried segments to investigate the levels of metal(loid)s, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), per-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and explore the microbial community composition. Results indicated that the PIOM present on long-term aged high-density polyethylene plastic harbored high concentrations of metal(loid)s, PAHs, and PFAS. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the bacterial composition in the PIOM differed by habitat type, which consisted of potentially pathogenic taxa including Vibrio, Shewanella, and Psychrobacter. This study provides new insights into PIOM as a potential sink for hazardous environmental contaminants and its role in enhancing the vector potential of plastic. Therefore, we recommend the inclusion of PIOM analysis in current biomonitoring regimes and that plastics be used with caution in aquaculture settings to safeguard valuable food resources, particularly in areas of point-source contamination. © 2021 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a heterogeneous group of persistent organic pollutants that have been detected in various environmental compartments around the globe. Emerging research has revealed the preferential accumulation of PFASs in shallow soil horizons, particularly at sites impacted by firefighting activities, agricultural applications, and atmospheric deposition. Once in the vadose zone, PFASs can sorb to soil, accumulate at interfaces, become volatilized, be taken up in biota, or leach to the underlying aquifer. At the same time, polyfluorinated precursor species may transform into highly recalcitrant perfluoroalkyl acids, changing their chemical identity and thus transport behavior along the way. In this review, we critically discuss the current state of the knowledge and aim to interconnect the complex processes that control the fate and transport of PFASs in the vadose zone. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and future research needs. Consequently, this review may serve as an interdisciplinary guide for the risk assessment and management of PFAS-contaminated sites. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is well known to break glucose homeostasis. However, the effects of PFOA on glucose metabolism are difficult to be evaluated because related metabolites may be synthesized from other nutritional substrates. Here, the relative contribution of glucose to metabolites (e.g., pyruvate and citrate) in the PFOA-treated human liver cells (HepG2) was determined using the C-13 isotope-based metabolic flux analysis (MFA), i.e., pathway activities. The relative percentage of [U-C-13(6)] glucose-derived pyruvate in cells exposed to PFOA was not significantly different from that in the controls, indicating that the metabolic pattern of glycolysis was not substantially changed by PFOA. The pathway activity of [U-C-13(6)] glucose-driven tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was dramatically inhibited by PFOA. Consequently, mitochondrial respiratory function was phenotypically impaired by PFOA, as observed from the decreasing basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ATP-linked OCR and spare respiratory capacity. This study suggests that PFOA may cause the abnormal glucose metabolism via altering the metabolic pattern of TCA cycle instead of glycolysis. The MFA is strongly recommended as a promising and robust tool to address the toxicity mechanisms of contaminants associated with glucose metabolism. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here, we investigated the effect of environmentally relevant concentrations of PFOA on the oxidative stress and metabolic regulation in lettuce (Lactuca sativa) root. Under the exposure to 5 and 50 μg/L PFOA for 10 days, 137.5 and 1275.0 ng PFOA/g dry weight were accumulated to roots, respectively. H2O2, the dominant reactive oxygen species, was slightly over-generated by 4.7%–9.5%. No signs of oxidative damage, such as lipid peroxidation, cell membrane integrity and soluble protein content, were observed. To deal with PFOA stress, the activities of ascorbate peroxidase and peroxidase and the contents of glutathione were dose-dependently up-regulated. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis revealed metabolite profiles were significantly altered by PFOA, involving the primary metabolism (e.g., sucrose, glucose, fructose-6-phosphate, methionine, γ-aminobutyric acid), and the biosynthesis of (poly)phenol (e.g., shikimate, naringenin) and alkaloid (e.g., geranyl diphosphate, dopamine). Our findings showed that environmentally relevant concentrations of PFOA significantly perturbed metabolisms in plant roots albeit no remarkable cell damage was induced. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Microplastics, as emerging pollutant, are predicted to act as carriers for organic pollutants, but the carrier role and bio-toxic effects with other pollutants in environments are poorly acknowledged. In this study, both the single and combined effects of polyethylene (PE, 10 and 40 mg/L) with the particle size of 100–150 μm and 9-Nitroanthracene (9-NAnt, 5 and 500 μg/L) on zebrafish (Danio rerio) had been investigated. The results illustrated that PE could be as 9-NAnt carrier to enter into zebrafish body, but significantly reduced the bioaccumulation of 9-NAnt, due to the occurrence of adsorption interactions between the simultaneous presence of both PE and 9-NAnt. After 4 days, the enzymes activity of cytochrome P4501A, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the abundance of malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid peroxide (LPO) responded strongly to low-dose PE exposure (10 mg/L). After 7 days exposure to PE-9-NAnt (40 mg/L), the P4501A activity increased significantly, but the activities of AChE and LDH were inhibited clearly, causing certain neurotoxicity and disorders of energy metabolism to zebrafish. The analysis of integrated biomarker response index (IBR) suggested that PE had greater bio-toxicity to zebrafish in all exposure groups after short-term exposure, but the PE-9-NAnt complex showed greater bio-toxicity after 7 days, which indicated that complex exposure of PE-9-NAnt had a delayed effect on the bio-toxicity of zebrafish. Furthermore, analysis of the intestinal microbiota exhibited that under the conditions of the exposure group with 9-NAnt, the relative abundance of the five dominant bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteriota, Bacteroidota and Verrucomicrobiota) changed greatly. Overall, this study confirmed that PE could carry 9-NAnt into fish causing bioaccumulation, but in the case of coexisting exposures, PE reduced 9-NAnt bioaccumulation, suggesting that microplastics with other emerging pollutants in chronic toxicity are probably next objects in future works. The bioaccumulation of 9-NAnt, strongly influenced by PE, caused limited bio-toxicity to zebrafish, but significantly changed the composition of intestinal microbiota. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Organic farming for higher ecological and human health benefits has been adopted in about 186 countries, covering a total area of 71.5 Mha worldwide. Because of the associated practices, the flows of several environmental pollutants into the organic products threaten food safety and human health. The contaminants that occur at higher concentrations in organic produce include persistent organic pollutants (61.3–436.9 ng g−1 lamb meat, and 0.28 pg g−1-2.75 ng g−1 bovine meat), heavy metals (0.5–33.0 mg kg−1 lettuce), organochlorine pesticides (11–199 μg g−1 carrots), cyclodienes, hexachlorocyclohexanes, hexabromocyclododecane (2–3 times higher than in conventionally produced porcine meat), hexachlorobenzene (1.38–14.49 ng g−1 fat in milk), and non-brominated flame retardants (1.3–3.2 times higher than in conventional produce of greenhouse-grown tomato and cucumber). Moreover, some pollutants like per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances with a longer half-life (1.50–9.10 yrs) are reported to occur in several organic products. In fact, several legacy persistent organic pollutants are known for their significant trophic magnification in an urban terrestrial ecosystem. In addition, many plant functionalities are adversely affected in organic farming. Therefore, the long-term usage of organic products containing such pollutants poses a significant threat to human health. The major limitation in organic livestock production is the severe shortage of organic feed. Several variable standards and technical regulations set by the government and private agencies are the major obstacles in the global marketing of organic products. The present review critically addresses the impact of organic farming on hidden risks due to the use of composts as the amendment resources that enhance the phytoaccumulation and trophic transfer of pollutants, the functional diversity of the ecosystems, and poor harmonization among the policies and regulations in different countries for organic farming. The future directions of research have been suggested to mitigate unintended flows of pollutants into the organic products. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Recent automotive research often focuses on automated driving, including the interaction between automated vehicles (AVs) and so-called vulnerable road users (VRUs). While road safety statistics and trafc psychology at least defne VRUs as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists, many publications on human-vehicle interaction use the term without even defning it. The actual target group remains unclear. Since each group already poses a broad spectrum of research challenges, a one-fts-all solution seems unrealistic and inappropriate, and a much clearer diferentiation is required. To foster clarity and comprehensibility, we propose a literature-based taxonomy providing a structured separation of (vulnerable) road users, designed to particularly (but not exclusively) support research on the communication between VRUs and AVs. It consists of two conceptual hierarchies and will help practitioners and researchers by providing a uniform and comparable set of terms needed for the design, implementation, and description of HCI applications. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={Extensive use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has caused their ubiquitous presence in natural waters. One of the standard practices for PFAS removal from water is adsorption onto granular activated carbon (GAC); however, this approach generates a new waste stream, i.e., PFAS-laden GAC. Considering the recalcitrance of PFAS molecules in the environment, inadequate disposal (e.g., landfill or incineration) of PFAS-laden GAC may let PFAS back into the aquatic cycle. Therefore, developing approaches for PFAS-laden GAC management present unique opportunities to break its forever circulation within the aqueous environment. This comprehensive review evaluates the past two decades of research on conventional thermal regeneration of GAC and critically analyzes and summarizes the literature on regeneration of PFAS-laden GACs. Optimized thermal regeneration of PFAS-laden GACs may provide an opportunity to employ existing regeneration infrastructure to mineralize the adsorbed PFAS and recover the spent GAC. The specific objectives of this review are (i) to investigate the role of physicochemical properties of PFAS on thermal regeneration, (ii) to assess the changes in regeneration yield as well as GAC physical and chemical structure upon thermal regeneration, and (iii) to critically discuss regeneration parameters controlling the process. This literature review on the engineered regeneration process illustrates the significant promise of this approach that can break the endless environmental cycle of these forever chemicals, while preserving the desired physicochemical properties of the valuable GAC adsorbent. © 2021 American Chemical Society.},

This study assesses the efficiency of two deep constructed wetlands (CWs) receiving partially treated sewage from a residential complex and a hospital designed for the removal of organics and pathogens. These systems were further analyzed for the presence of major ARB to identify the role of CWs in mitigating antibiotic resistance among microbial communities. The bacterial community responsible for metabolic conversions was analyzed by metagenomic sequencing. Finally, the efficiencies of deep CWs were analyzed for the removal of specific bacteria resistant to three antibiotics—piperacillin, colistin (polymixin E), and cefoperazone. The overall removal of extended spectrum beta lactamase producers and carbapenemase producers was also studied. Our results indicate that CWs offer decent BOD and COD removal efficiencies of 74.04–78.71% and 53.85–64.37% respectively. However, a zero-order reaction between loading rate and removal rate was obtained after loading rate of 170 g/m2.day indicating the organic loading capacity of the system. Metagenomic analysis revealed the presence of bacteria with diverse metabolic potentials for substrate conversion. Removal of fecal coliforms was high in the CWs, but the most interesting observation was the attenuation in ARB, which was found to be comparable to, or even better, than the reported values from conventional moving bed bioreactor. This observation may be attributed to the high retention times offered by CWs compared to that of conventional systems making them an attractive future alternative for treating domestic as well as hospital sewage for emerging pollutants. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a persistent environmental contaminant, resists environmental degradation and bioaccumulates in food chains. Lots of literatures have proved that PFOA exposure could disrupt detoxifying function in a variety of organisms, however, it still remained poorly known about this in mollusk. Here, we examined physiological, transcriptomic, and metabolomic responses to PFOA in Mytilus edulis, a model organism frequently used in studies of aquatic pollution. We aimed to characterize PFOA-induced stress responses and detoxification mechanisms. PFOA exposure significantly altered antioxidant enzyme activity levels and the abundances of lipid peroxidation products. In addition, transcriptomic analysis indicated that several genes associated with oxidative stress and detoxication were differentially expressed after PFOA exposure. In combination, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses showed that PFOA exposure disturbed several metabolic processes in M. edulis, including the lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism etc. Molecular examination and enzymes assay of PFOA-exposed M. edulis after a 7-day depuration period still did not recover to control levels. The Pathway enrichment analysis proved that several pathways related to detoxification, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) pathway etc, were obviously affected. The present work verifies firstly PFOA disruption to molluscan detoxification and identifies the key pathways to understand the molecular mechanisms thereof. This study provides new insights into the detoxication disruption invoked in response to PFOA exposure in M. edulis. © 2021},

abstract={The 11th international “Water & Health” seminar took place from June 24–26, 2019 in Cannes, France. The seminar is sponsored annually by Suez, a 150-year-old multinational water and waste management company, to support research into water quality and health carried out by advanced doctoral students. It promotes ongoing communication among students, established scientists, and industry practitioners from all over the world. The seminar aims to: enhance dialogue between junior scientists and senior mentors, spotlight early-breaking research concepts and results, cross disciplinary boundaries to contribute to the advancement of water safety, and identify new critical research needs. This special issue contains a number of articles on challenges such as emerging pollutants and antimicrobial resistance, as well as both high-tech and nature-based solutions. Some key topics from the seminar and this special issue include advancing data modeling to consider heterogeneity of populations, recognizing synergies among environmental health interventions, optimizing health by building resiliency through measured risk exposure, and understanding the role of contextual factors in tailoring intervention strategies to a given population or setting. The winning seminar presentation came from Tanguy Pouzol, who modeled the release of 15 pharmaceuticals in effluents from a semi-urban area of 16,000 inhabitants and a 450-bed hospital. Pharmaceuticals have been detected in all types of water bodies worldwide and have been the subject of numerous risk assessments since the 1970s, as described in several recent comprehensive reviews (Ebele et al., 2017; Kümmerer, 2016; Li, 2014; Palli et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2017). Gosset et al. (2020) report a comparison of ecotoxicological risk assessment approaches for a “cocktail” of chemical pollutants, including pharmaceutical residues, discharged by urban wastewater treatment plants near Lyon, France. Their findings demonstrate the importance of jointly considering all the components of a pollutant mixture for accurate assessment of environmental risks. However, measuring concentrations of pharmaceutical residues in water remains a complex task. Analytical techniques under development that may improve environmental detection of pharmaceuticals include DNA nanobiosensors, which are reviewed by Soukarié et al. (2020) in this special issue. DNA nanobiosensors present a promising approach for an array of water quality monitoring applications, including the detection of microorganisms, as described by one of the review co-authors, Diana Soukarié, in a seminar presentation on her ongoing research. The ongoing challenge of environmental measurement also highlights the need for complementary approaches to characterize pharmaceutical concentrations in environmental waters, such as simulation modeling. The model proposed by Dr. Pouzol (Pouzol et al., 2020) was based on the monthly sales recorded in 6 pharmacies and the daily consumption of the hospital, over 2.5 years, with hypotheses on the frequency of consumption, metabolism and release in wastewaters. For most molecules, the modeled concentrations matched well with the concentrations observed during several monitoring campaigns. The model allowed prediction of wastewater flows and changes in concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the effluents, on an hourly time scale, and thus prediction of important concentration peaks that cannot be observed by random or integrated sampling. Compared to classical approaches, such a model improved the average performance by one-third while giving additional information. Future improvements and perspectives should focus on improving knowledge on pharmaceutical loads, especially their variability at both daily and hourly scales, including in-sewer processes and improving the usability of the model by simplifying it while keeping its stochastic nature. The recent Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Synthesis Report on Water and Sanitation emphasized that the world is not on track to achieve global SDG 6 targets by 2030 and highlighted the need for improved understanding of the baseline status and trends of global indicators to support renewed progress (UN Water, 2018). The seminar and special issue addressed the challenges and interactions among development goals that must be considered to achieve sustainable water and sanitation for all. A microbial source tracking (MST) study conducted by Dr. David Holcomb in Mozambican households found widespread human fecal contamination, highlighting the obstacles to improving sanitary conditions through simple interventions directed at households (Holcomb et al., 2020). A study characterizing human fecal pollution of Thai surface waters using host-associated bacteriophages identified opportunities to reduce diarrheal disease risks at a broader scale through improved coastal water quality management (Chyerochana et al., 2020). These and other recent evaluation studies reflect a growing awareness of the synergies among water and health risks and other development interventions. For instance, efforts to mitigate environmental transmission of fecal pathogens must address sustainable management of fecal wastes throughout the sanitation chain. The decentralized sanitation infrastructure common in rapidly growing urban areas in particular requires effective solutions for fecal sludge removal and treatment. An intervention impact study in Maputo, Mozambique demonstrated how subsidized pour-flush sanitation systems can increase hygienic emptying of fecal sludge, but also highlighted that the use of such services was unaffordable for many users (Capone et al., 2020). Dr. Paul Hunter presented a discussion on how our ongoing knowledge of threats posed by waterborne noroviruses is shifting to account for population variability and the factors that influence susceptibility. Along the same lines, Sital Uprety demonstrated geographic variation in diarrheal disease risk in rural Nepal through a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) informed by a cross-sectional evaluation of household drinking water quality in the aftermath of the 2015 earthquake disaster (Uprety et al., 2020). While Uprety et al. used the fecal indicator bacterium (FIB) Escherichia coli to characterize risk under a reference pathogen approach, the seminar featured a discussion of the limitations of QMRA for predicting pathogen-specific risks. Specifically, QMRA has been found to overestimate disease burdens for pathogens such as norovirus, for which there remains substantial uncertainty around both the dose-response relationships and the implications of population immunity (Van Abel et al., 2017). The growing issue of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) organisms compounds the risks posed by enteric infections. In addition to selection pressure driving an increase in AMR organisms in clinical settings, the presentation and article by Voigt et al. (2020) presented evidence for the introduction of antibiotic residues, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) to environmental waters downstream of wastewater treatment facilities. Such risks are not confined to surface water, as demonstrated in an article by Salazar et al. (2020), which found aerosolized ARB in proximity of a river passing through La Paz, Bolivia, where urban population densities imply an elevated risk of exposure. A seminar presentation by Dr. Karen Setty discussed intervention design, specifically the evidence base to address contextual variability in Water Safety Plan implementation and scale-up (Setty et al., 2019; Setty, 2019). Water safety plans represent a risk management approach developed by the World Health Organization to support safe drinking water provision (Bartram et al., 2009). These plans can be adapted to different resource settings from a community to industrial scale, and have the potential to enhance equitable outcomes (Ross et al., 2019). Dr. Setty borrowed concepts from the emerging field of implementation science to understand and better explain why results of complex interventions often vary among locations. Recognizing these site-specific contextual constraints or “barriers” and matching them to active, proven strategies can help to extend water, sanitation, and hygiene services to all under SDG 6 (United Nations, 2015). Articles in this issue recognize the outstanding needs of underserved populations such as the Roma in Europe (Anthonj et al., 2020), sustainable pit latrine emptying practices in low-income settings such as Mozambique (Capone et al., 2020), and affordable drinking water treatment using local materials such as curry leaf (Mukherjee et al., 2020). Contextual clues also offer a bridge to potential “quality improvement” solutions through rapid experimental cycling of pilots, data collection, and adjusted approaches (Setty et al., 2019; Setty, 2019). Finally, a short communication by Dr. Mark LeChevallier bridges the ideas and challenges raised in the 2019 seminar with other global phenomena underlying access to safe water (namely, climate change). Dr. LeChevallier illustrates how climate shifts are already impacting water and health by heightening risks and requiring innovative adaptation of existing systems (LeChevallier, 2020). Climate adaptation will draw increased attention as the central theme of a future Water and Health seminar. © 2021},

abstract={Exposure to environmental toxicants is linked to long-term adverse outcomes in the brain and involves the dysfunction of glial and neuronal cells. Astrocytes, the most numerous cell type, are increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases of the central nervous system, including neurodegenerative diseases. Astrocytes are critical for proper brain function in part due to their robust antioxidant and unique metabolic capabilities. Additionally, astrocytes are positioned both at the blood-brain barrier, where they are the primary responders to xenobiotic penetrance of the CNS, and at synapses where they are in close contact with neurons and synaptic machinery. While exposure to several classes of environmental toxicants, including chlorinated and fluorinated compounds, and trace metals, have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, their impact on astrocytes represents an important and growing field of research. Here, we review existing literature focused on the impact of a range of synthetic compounds on astrocytic function. We focus specifically on perturbed metabolic processes in response to these compounds and consider how perturbation of these pathways impacts disease pathogenesis. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={Photochemical vapor generation (PVG) of bismuth was accomplished in a simple flow–injection system with a standard Hg low-pressure tube lamp and a coiled Teflon reactor. The influence of a reaction medium flow rate (irradiation time) and composition was investigated using a miniature diffusion flame atomizer and high-resolution continuum source atomic absorption spectrometry. Combination of 40% (v/v) acetic acid, 1.25% (v/v) formic acid and a metal sensitizer at a flow rate of 3 mL min−1 (irradiation time of 90 s) was found optimal. The use of various metals as sensitizers was studied to initiate and enhance PVG substantially. The evident positive effect was found for four metal cations and the enhancement effect was in the following order: Cu2+ &lt; Cd2+ &lt; Fe2+ ≪ Co2+. At 50 mg L−1 Co2+ as the sensitizer, the overall PVG efficiency of 54 ± 2% was determined from relative comparison of sensitivities obtained with PVG and liquid nebulization coupled simultaneously to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In order to reach low limits of detection (LOD) at low operation cost, a coupling of PVG to atomic fluorescence spectrometry was tested and conditions of atomization in two flame atomizers were optimized. A blank-limited LOD of 12 ng L−1 was obtained with an advanced flame-in-gas-shield atomizer, which competes with PVG coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (5 ng L−1). Interferences from commonly used inorganic acids (HNO3, HCl and H2SO4) and other elements (As3+, Pb2+, Sb3+, Se4+ and Te4+) were also investigated and the accuracy was verified by analysis of water Standard Reference Material NIST 1643f. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Humanity has come to depend on synthetic, factory made gases that have extremely significant global warming potential. Fluorinated greenhouse gases, or F-gases, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) have been termed “super pollutants” and “super greenhouse gases” given their severe and powerful impact on the climate. They are the most potent greenhouse gases known to modern science, with global warming potentials far greater than carbon dioxide, some up to almost 24,000 times more so. Troublingly, they are also the fastest growing class of greenhouse gas emissions around the world, especially in developing countries. Research suggest that almost 40% of their emissions by 2050 will fall outside the scope of international agreements such as the Paris Accord, Montreal Protocol and Kigali Amendment. Without comprehensive and sustained interventions, uncontrolled growth in F-gas emissions could offset all of the gains made by the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, or the cornerstone of existing international climate governance, the Nationally Determined Contributions of the 2015 Paris Accord. This review asks: What options are available to mitigate the environmental impacts of F-gases and thus make their manufacturing or disposal far more sustainable? What technical solutions and innovations exist to make their industrial usage low to zero carbon? What benefits will accrue from F-gas mitigation, and what barriers will need addressed? It undertakes a comprehensive and critical review of more than 140,000 sources of evidence, and a short list of 855 studies on the topic. It utilizes a sociotechnical lens that examines the manufacturing and use of F-gases across multiple sectors (including refrigeration, electronics manufacturing, non-ferrous metals processing, and applications in consumer goods) and components of its lifecycle (including not only manufacturing, but also use, disposal and destruction). We find that there are several policies and regulations that can be employed to address this already serious and growing climate change challenge. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Caffeine is an emerging pollutant and is considered the most representative pollutant of the Pharmaceutical Active due to its high consumption by the general population. It can be used to track pollution caused by humans. Different technologies have been employed to remove the caffeine from aqueous media, however the adsorption has been preferred due to its simplicity, high removal efficiency, operational and implementation facility and low cost. This paper provides a systematic review of the published peer-reviewed literature concerned with caffeine removal by the adsorption process. The Scopus and ScienceDirect databases were used to identify relevant articles researches on caffeine removal. Many authors have studied caffeine's adsorption equilibrium in aqueous media, different conditions, and different adsorbents. This paper aims to uncover the overall trend of adsorbent used, kinetic and thermodynamic studies. The impact of pH, temperature, adsorbent dosage and competitive effect were presented and analyzed. It was observed that the adsorption capacities ranged between 10 and 1000 mg g−1, according to the nature and properties of the adsorbent. The pseudo-second order (kinetic model) and the Langmuir isotherm model showed the best adjustment of the experimental data from caffeine adsorption in most studies. The mechanistic understanding of adsorption and the development of new adsorbents are still a matter of future research, as well as the use of other kinetic models based on statistical factors and the thermodynamic studies should be considered. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is an artificial organic substance widely used for decades, which seriously threatens human health. This study aimed to identify human-relevant correlates between PFOA exposure and the male rodent reproductive system. We performed a systematic literature review of the relevant literature of PubMed, Cochrane Library databases, Web of Science and Embase from the establishment to April 2020. Studies included the effects of PFOA on the reproductive system of male rodents. The meta-analysis was performed on the basis of the following points: level of testosterone and estradiol in serum, development of reproductive organs, pathological changes of reproduction organs and parameters of semen. A series of 16 studies was enrolled in this study. The standard mean difference (SMD) for PFOA-related reproductive toxicity was summarised as −0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71, −0.07). The lower serum testosterone levels, decreased absolute testicular and epididymal weights, higher serum estradiol levels, elevated relative testicular and seminal vesicle weights and increased incidence of Leydig cell adenoma and percentage of abnormal sperm were observed in the exposed group compared with the control group. However, no statistical difference was found in the day of preputial separation of pups and percentage of motile sperm. In conclusion, PFOA exposure heightens the reproductive system damage in male rodents. However, many studies included in the review did not identify mechanisms by which PFOA induces changes to the male reproductive system, which is an area for additional study. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

A continuous evaluation is needed to combine the inconsistent results. In this study, we explored the associations between PFASs exposure and the low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth and small for gestational age (SGA). The quality of selected literature, quantitative estimates, publication bias and subgroup analysis were performed on the basis of 17 retrieved articles published before December 2020. The results showed a significant positive association between the perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure and the risk of LBW[Odds ratio (OR)=1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.36; heterogeneity: P=0.30, I2=17%]. The positive association was also observed between the PFOS and the risk of preterm birth (OR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.39, P=0.007; I2=62%). There was a paucity of evidence regarding the negative effects of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) on the pregnancy outcomes. The findings from the subgroup analysis (the sampling period, the birth gender and biologic specimens) did not substantially altered the results of the overall pooled estimate ORs. The increased prevalence of negative birth outcomes with gestational PFASs exposure warrants further explorations from biological process perspective.

abstract={In this critical review, we explored the most recent advances about the fate of antibiotics on biological wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Although the occurrence of these pollutants in wastewater and natural streams has been investigated previously, some recent publications still expose the need to improve the detection strategies and the lack of information about their transformation products. The role of the antibiotic properties and the process operating conditions were also analyzed. The pieces of evidence in the literature associate several molecular properties to the antibiotic removal pathway, like hydrophobicity, chemical structure, and electrostatic interactions. Nonetheless, the influence of operating conditions is still unclear, and solid retention time stands out as a key factor. Additionally, the efficiencies and pathways of antibiotic removals on conventional (activated sludge, membrane bioreactor, anaerobic digestion, and nitrogen removal) and emerging bioprocesses (bioelectrochemical systems, fungi, and enzymes) were assessed, and our concern about potential research gaps was raised. The combination of different bioprocess can efficiently mitigate the impacts generated by these pollutants. Thus, to plan and design a process to remove and mineralize antibiotics from wastewater, all aspects must be addressed, the pollutant and process characteristics and how it is the best way to operate it to reduce the impact of antibiotics in the environment. © 2021 Elsevier LtdThis review approaches the main aspects that influence antibiotic degradation by bioprocesses and assess how those processes affect their removal. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The two MOFs were originally obtained in pure form in similar conditions, using ammonium cerium nitrate and tetrafluoroterephthalic acid as reagents, and small variations of the reaction parameters were found to yield mixed phases. Here, we investigate the crystallisation of these compounds, varying parameters such as temperature, amount of the protonation modulator nitric acid and amount of the coordination modulator acetic acid. When only HNO3 is present in the reaction environment, only F4_MIL-140A(Ce) is obtained. Heating preferentially accelerates nucleation, which becomes rate determining below 57 °C. Upon addition of AcOH to the system, alongside HNO3, mixed-phased products are obtained. F4_UiO-66(Ce) is always formed faster, and no interconversion between the two phases occurs. In the case of F4_UiO-66(Ce), crystal growth is always the rate-determining step. A higher amount of HNO3 favours the formation of F4_MIL-140A(Ce), whereas increasing the amount of AcOH favours the formation of F4_UiO-66(Ce). Based on the in situ results, a new optimised route to achieving a pure, high-quality F4_MIL-140A(Ce) phase in mild conditions (60 °C, 1 h) is also identified. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

abstract={The development of high-throughput screening methodologies may decrease the need for laboratory animals for toxicity testing. Here, we investigate the potential of assessing immunotoxicity with high-throughput screening data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ToxCast program. As case studies, we analyzed the most common chemicals added to food as well as per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) shown to migrate to food from packaging materials or processing equipment. The antioxidant preservative tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) showed activity both in ToxCast assays and in classical immunological assays, suggesting that it may affect the immune response in people. From the PFAS group, we identified eight substances that can migrate from food contact materials and have ToxCast data. In epidemiological and toxicological studies, PFAS suppress the immune system and decrease the response to vaccination. However, most PFAS show weak or no activity in immune-related ToxCast assays. This lack of concordance between toxicological and high-throughput data for common PFAS indicates the current limitations of in vitro screening for analyzing immunotoxicity. High-throughput in vitro assays show promise for providing mechanistic data relevant for immune risk assessment. In contrast, the lack of immune-specific activity in the existing high-throughput assays cannot validate the safety of a chemical for the immune system. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Objective: We define the prevalence threshold as the prevalence level below which a test's positive predictive value (PPV) declines most sharply relative to disease prevalence – and thus the rate of false positive results/false discovery rate increases most rapidly. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence threshold of various screening tests used in obstetrics and gynecology among low-risk women in modern clinical practice. Methods: We searched Medline, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane database, and PubMed to obtain the sensitivity and specificity estimates for the following screening tests: 50 g-oral glucose tolerance test (GDM-50 g), non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), combined first trimester screening (FTS), vagino-rectal swab for group B streptococcus (GBS) in pregnancy, cervical cytology (Pap) and HPV testing, mammography and manual breast exam, urinary PCR and cervical-vaginal swab testing for gonorrhoea and chlamydia as well as AMH for the diagnosis of PCOS. We used these estimates to calculate disease-specific prevalence thresholds, comparing them to the actual estimates of disease prevalence. Results: The prevalence thresholds and average estimates of disease prevalence (shown in brackets) are as follows: GDM-50 g 31 % (6%), NIPT 7% (0.2 %), combined FTS 19.5 % (0.2 %), GBS swab 18 % (15–45 %), Pap 21 % (0.2 %), HPV 27 % (0.2 %), mammography 25 % (12.5 %), breast exam 25 % (12.5 %), gonorrhoea -chlamydia 6–13 % (4.2–4.7 %), AMH for PCOS 32 % (10 %). Conclusion: The prevalence thresholds of various screening tests used in obstetrics and gynecology are well above the estimated disease prevalence. This implies that when undertaking population-level screening a significant proportion of positive screening tests obtained are likely false-positives. Attempts at individualizing pre-test probability when undertaking population-level screening are needed in order to best interpret the results of screening tests. © 2021},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health crisis due to devastating cognitive symptoms, a lack of curative treatments, and increasing prevalence. Most cases are sporadic (>95% of cases) after the age of 65 years, implicating an important role of environmental factors in disease pathogenesis. Environmental neurotoxicants have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's Disease and AD. Animal models of AD and in vitro studies have shed light on potential neuropathological mechanisms, yet the biochemical and molecular underpinnings of AD-relevant environmental neurotoxicity remain poorly understood. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a potentially critical pathogenic target of environmentally induced neurotoxicity. BACE1 clearly has a critical role in AD pathophysiology: It is required for amyloid beta production and expression and activity of BACE1 are increased in the AD brain. Though the literature on BACE1 in response to environmental insults is limited, current studies, along with extensive AD neurobiology literature suggest that BACE1 deserves attention as an important neurotoxic target. Here, we critically review research on environmental neurotoxicants such as metals, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, polyfluoroalkyl substances, heterocyclic aromatic amines, advanced glycation end products, and acrolein that modulate BACE1 and potential mechanisms of action. Though more research is needed to clearly understand whether BACE1 is a critical mediator of AD-relevant neurotoxicity, available reports provide convincing evidence that BACE1 is altered by environmental risk factors associated with AD pathology, implying that BACE1 inhibition and its use as a biomarker should be considered in AD management and research. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

abstract={Metabolites in the body fluid are becoming a rich source of disease biomarkers. Developing an effective and high throughput detection and analysis platform of metabolites is of great importance for potential biomarker discovery and validation. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) has been successfully applied in rapid biomolecules detection in large scale. However, non-negligible background interference in low molecule-weight region still constitutes a main challenge even though various nanomaterials have been developed as an alternative to traditional organic matrix. In this work, a novel composite chip, silicon nanowires loaded with fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP@SiNWs) was fabricated. It can serve as an excellent substrate for nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS) detection with ultra-low background noise in low molecular weight region (<500 Da). Ion desorption efficiency and internal energy transfer of FEP@SiNWs were studied using benzylpyridinium salt and tetraphenylboron salt as thermometer chemicals. The results indicated that a non-thermal desorption mechanism might be involved in the LDI process on FEP@SiNWs. Owing to the higher LDI efficiency and low background interference of this novel substrate, the metabolic fingerprint of complex bio-fluids, such as human saliva, can be sensitively and stably acquired. As a proof of concept, FEP@SiNWs chip was successfully used in the detection of salivary metabolites. With the assistance of multivariate analysis, 22 metabolic candidates (p < 0.05) which can discriminate type 2 diabetes mellitus (2-DM) and healthy volunteers were found and identified. The role of these feature metabolites in the metabolic pathway involved in 2-DM was confirmed by literature mining. This work demonstrates that FEP@SiNWs-based NIMS might be served as an efficient and high throughput platform for metabolic biomarker exploration and clinical diagnosis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

The purpose of present study was to perform a systematic literature review on the effects of augmentation technique in patients with osteoporotic hip fractures. Material and methods: A comprehensive literature search was systematically performed to evaluate all papers published in English language included in the literature between January 2010 and July 2020, according to the PRISMA 2009 guidelines. In vivo and in vitro studies, case reports, review articles, cadaveric studies, biomechanical studies, histological studies, oncological studies, technical notes, studies dealing with radiological classifications and studies on revision surgery were excluded. Results: A total of 5 studies involving 301 patients were included. Patients had a mean age of 84.6 years and were followed up for a mean period of 11 months. The proximal femoral fractures were stabilized with implantation of the PFNA or Gamma nail and augmentation was performed with two different cements: polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in 4 studies and calcium phosphate (CP) in one study. Overall, 57.5% of patients reached the same or greater preoperative mobility, and postoperative Parker Mobility Score and Harris Hip Score were acceptable. No significantly complications were observed, and no additional surgery related to the implant was required. Conclusion: The results of this systematic review show that cement augmentation is a safe and effectiveness method of fixation to treat trochanteric fractures. © 2020 Delhi Orthopedic Association},

A review of experimental evidences supporting the existence of FTS transitions is presented. In particular FTS transitions are found to be concomitant with a peak in heat-capacity as well as density extrema associated with a negative expansion coefficient in the region of the transition. Moreover, spectroscopic analyses also show distinct structural changes across these liquid-liquid transitions.

abstract={Granulosa cell tumors (GCT) of the ovary have a good prognosis. Recurrence tends to be late; however, > 66 % of patients with recurrent GCT die from the disease. Most recurrences are abdominopelvic, although distant metastases have been documented. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a mixture of persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) stimulates the invasion of GCT cells. We selected perfluorooctanoate (PFOA, 2 ng/mL), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS, 8 ng/mL), 2,2-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p’-DDE, 1 ng/mL), polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (PCB153, 100 pg/mL), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB, 50 pg/mL), which have the highest measured concentrations in follicular fluid of women undergoing treatment with assisted reproductive technology. The human GCT cell lines COV434 and KGN have been used as in vitro models of juvenile (JGCT) and adult (AGCT) GCT subtypes, respectively. Cells were treated with a mixture of the test compounds for 15 min prior to analysis of protein phosphorylation; for 4 h prior to analysis in a circular chemorepellent-induced defect assay; for 6 h prior to analysis of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) activity; for 24 h prior to analysis of migration, invasion, and gene expression; and for 48 h prior to analysis of protein expression. First, we showed that KGN cells migrated and exhibited invasive behavior. By contrast, COV434 cells lacked migration and invasion potential. Moreover, expression of mesenchymal genes and the gene encoding MMP2 was higher in KGN cells, and that of epithelial genes lower, than that in COV434 cells. Treatment of KGN cells with the EDC mixture stimulated cell migration, invasion, and lymphatic dissemination. The results suggest that the role of the EDC mixture in AGCT invasion is not related to changes in expression of epithelial and mesenchymal genes; rather, it is related to increased expression and activity of MMP2. Additionally, silencing insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1R) in AGCT abolished the stimulatory effect of the EDC mixture on KGN spheroid invasion. These results demonstrate that the EDC mixture increased KGN spheroid invasion by stimulating expression and activity of MMP2 via IGF1R. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

Also, we highlight emerging research findings that support a role for parainfection in the pathophysiology of AMD, a disease of the neurosensory retina that has been shown to share risk factors and pathological features with AD. Acute neurological infections, such as Bacterial Meningitis (BM), trigger inflammatory events that permanently change how the brain functions, leading to lasting cognitive impairment. Neuroinflammation likewise is a known pathological event that occurs in the early stages of chronic age-related neurodegenerative diseases AD and AMD and might be triggered as a parainfectious event. To date, at least 16 microbial pathogens have been linked to the development of AD; on the other hand, investigation of a microbe-AMD relationship is in its infancy. This mini-review article provides a synthesis of existing evidence indicating a contribution of parainfection in the aetiology of AD and of emerging findings that support a similar process in AMD. Subsequently, it describes the major immunopathological mechanisms that are common to BM and AD/AMD. Together, this evidence leads to our proposal that both AD and AMD may have an infectious aetiology that operates through a dysregulated inflammatory response, leading to deleterious outcomes. Last, it draws fresh insights from the existing literature about potential therapeutic options for BM that might alleviate neurological disruption associated with infections, and which could, by extension, be explored in the context of AD and AMD. © Copyright © 2021 Too, Hunt and Simunovic.},

abstract={Raptors (birds of prey and owls) have been widely used as suitable bioindicators of environmental pollution. They occupy the highest trophic positions in their food chains and are documented to bioaccumulate high concentrations of persistent pollutants such as toxic metals and legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs).Whereas raptors played a critical role in developing awareness of and policy for chemical pollution, they have thus far played a much smaller role in current research on contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Given the critical knowledge obtained from monitoring 'legacy contaminants' in raptors, more information on the levels and effects of CECs on raptors is urgently needed. This study critically reviews studies on raptors fromEurope reporting the occurrence of CECs with focus on the investigated species, the sampled matrices, and the bioanalytical methods applied. Based on this, we aimed to identify future needs for monitoring CECs in Europe. Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), novel flame retardants (NFRs), and to a lesser extent UV-filters, neonicotinoids, chlorinated paraffins, parabens and bisphenols have been reported in European raptors. White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), Peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) were the most frequently studied raptor species. Among matrices, eggs, feathers and plasmawere the most widely employed, although the potential role of the preen gland as an excretory organ for CECs has recently been proposed. This review highlights the following research priorities for pollution research on raptors in Europe: 1) studies covering all the main classes of CECs; 2) research in other European regions (mainly East Europe); 3) identification of the most suitable matrices and species for the analysis of different CECs; and 4) the application of alternative sample treatment strategies (e.g. QuEChERS or pressurized liquid extraction) is still limited and conventional solventextraction is the preferred choice.

abstract={BACKGROUND: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of HR and PFNA in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly. METHODS: We carried out this review according to the principle of preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline. The clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies (RCSs), and case-control studies involving HR and PFNA in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly from 2000 to 2020 were compared by searching Web of Science, Pubmed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase. The quality of the included cohort study (CS) lines was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The quality of the included RCT lines was evaluated using Jadad. Forest plots were drawn by RevMan5.4 software based on the results and the data were analyzed. RESULTS: After screening, a total of 9 articles were included, of which one was a clinical RCT and eight were RCSs with 1374 patients. The operative time of the PFNA group was shorter [WMD = 15.20; 95% CI (13.17, 17.23), P < .05] and the intraoperative blood loss was less [WMD = 178.81; 95% CI (97.24, 260.38), P < .05] than the HR group, while the first weight-bearing time of the HR group was shorter [WMD = -7.70; 95% CI (-10.54, -4.86), P  < .05] than the PFNA group. There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay, HHS, postoperative orthopedic complications, and postoperative medical complications between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: With the development of HR technology and minimally invasive technology, the trauma caused by surgery is decreasing. Under the premise of improving perioperative management, such as optimizing the preoperative preparation and postoperative management, shortening the operative time, reducing intraoperative blood loss, and actively managing co-existing diseases, HR has more advantages than PFNA in the treatment of senile intertrochanteric fractures.

abstract={Top predators are used as indicators of contaminant trends across space and time. However, signals are integrated over complex food webs, and variation in diet may confound such signals. Trophic position, assessed by bulk δ15N, is widely used to infer the variation in diet relevant to contamination, yet a single variable cannot completely describe complex food webs. Thus, we examined relationships across three aquatic systems varying from a single species to a small food web using bulk values from four isotopes and 21 amino acid-specific values. Because variation in baseline ('source') δ15N can confound estimates of trophic position, we calculated trophic position from the difference between δ15Ntrophic (δ15N for amino acids that change with trophic position) and δ15Nsource (δ15N for amino acids that do not change with trophic position). Across all three systems, variation in δ15Nsource explained over half of the variation in bulk δ15N, and stable isotope values that reflected the base of the food web (δ13C, δ18O, δ34S) predicted contaminants as well or better than δ15N—which was supported by a meta-analysis of other studies. In ospreys feeding in lakes, variation in δ15Nsource across space created a spurious relationship between ΣDDT and apparent trophic position, and masked a relationship between ΣPCB and trophic position. In a seabird guild, changes in diet over time obscured temporal variation in contaminants over five decades. In Arctic fish and invertebrates, more accurate trophic magnification factors were calculated using δ15Ntrophic-source. Thus, (1) using δ15Ntrophic-source, instead of bulk δ15N, avoided incorrect conclusions and improved accuracy of trophic magnification factors necessary to assess risk to top predators; and (2) diet assessed with multiple spatial isotopes, rather than δ15N alone, was essential to understand patterns in contaminants across space, time and biological communities. Trophic position was most important for lipophilic ‘legacy’ contaminants (ΣDDT, ΣPCB) and habitat was most important for other contaminants (ΣPBDE, ΣPFAS, mercury). We argue that the use of amino acid-specific analysis of δ15N alongside ‘non-trophic’ isotopes should be a core feature of any study that examines the influence of trophic position on chemical pollution, as required for a chemical to be added to international conventions such as the Stockholm Convention. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={It is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid exposure to man-made endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and environmental toxicants. This escalating yet constant exposure is postulated to partially explain the concurrent decline in human fertility that has occurred over the last 50 years. Controversy however remains as to whether associations exist, with conflicting findings commonly reported for all major EDC classes. The primary aim of this extensive work was to identify and review strong peer-reviewed evidence regarding the effects of environmentally-relevant EDC concentrations on adult male and female fertility during the critical periconception period on reproductive hormone concentrations, gamete and embryo characteristics, as well as the time to pregnancy in the general population. Secondly, to ascertain whether individuals or couples diagnosed as sub-fertile exhibit higher EDC or toxicant concentrations. Lastly, to highlight where little or no data exists that prevents strong associations being identified. From the greater than 1480 known EDCs, substantial evidence supports a negative association between exposure to phthalates, PCBs, PBDEs, pyrethroids, organochloride pesticides and male fertility and fecundity. Only moderate evidence exists for a negative association between BPA, PCBs, organochloride pesticides and female fertility and fecundity. Overall fewer studies were reported in women than men, with knowledge gaps generally evident for both sexes for all the major EDC classes, as well as a paucity of female fertility studies following exposure to parabens, triclosans, dioxins, PFAS, organophosphates and pyrethroids. Generally, sub-fertile individuals or couples exhibit higher EDC concentrations, endorsing a positive association between EDC exposure and sub-fertility. This review also discusses confounding and limiting factors that hamper our understanding of EDC exposures on fertility and fecundity. Finally, it highlights future research areas, as well as government, industry and social awareness strategies required to mitigate the negative effects of EDC and environmental toxicant exposure on human fertility and fecundity. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: The number of studies addressing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and cancer is increasing. Many communities have had water contaminated by PFAS, and cancer is one of the important community concerns related to PFAS exposure. Objectives: We critically reviewed the evidence relating to PFAS and cancer from an epidemiologic standpoint to highlight directions for future research that would be the most likely to meaningfully increase knowledge. Methods: We conducted a search in PubMed for studies of cancer and PFAS (through 9/20/2020). We identified epidemiologic studies that provided a quantitative estimate for some measure of the association between PFAS and cancer. Here, we review that literature, including several aspects of epidemiologic study design that impact the usefulness of study results. Results: We identified 16 cohort (or case-cohort) studies, 10 case-control studies (4 nested within cohorts and 6 non-nested), 1 cross sectional study and 1 ecologic study. The cancer sites with the most evidence of an association with PFAS are testicular and kidney cancer. There are also some suggestions in a few studies of an association with prostate cancer, but the data are inconsistent. Discussion: Each study's design has strengths and limitations. Weaknesses in study design and methods can, in some cases, lead to questionable associations, but in other cases can make it more difficult to detect true associations, if they are present. Overall, the evidence for an association between cancer and PFAS remains sparse. A variety of studies with different strengths and weaknesses can be helpful to clarify associations between PFAS and cancer. Long term follow-up of large-sized cohorts with large exposure contrasts are most likely to be informative. © 2021},

To understand the development of VOC profiles during fruit development, we performed metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis of two cantaloupe varieties over the course of fruit development. A total of 130 metabolites were detected in fruit samples, and 449014207 reads were mapped to the melon genome. A total of 4469 differentially expressed genes in fruits were identified and used to visualize the transition of VOC and transcriptomic profiles during the fruit development. A shift of VOC profiles in both varieties was observed from early-fruit profiles enriched in C5-C8 lipid-derived VOCs to late-fruit profiles abundant in C9 lipid-derived VOCs, apocarotenoids, and esters. The shift coincided with the expression of specific isoforms of lipid and carotenoid metabolizing enzymes as well as transcription factors involved in fruit ripening, metabolite regulation, and hormone signaling. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

We describe the most common materials (silica, organic, and hybrid organic silica) and strategies for constructing monoliths in different moulds and shapes (tubes, cartridges, stir bars, fibers) published since 2015. The functionalization of the pore surfaces enhances their affinity towards different classes of pollutants. For instance, the incorporation of chelating groups enables the enrichment of potentially toxic metals and semi-metals in aquatic environments before the analyses by spectrometric techniques. Monolithic materials for extracting emerging pollutants, diverse classes of herbicides, and fungicides were proposed recently. Incorporation of carbon-based and magnetic nanoparticles, metal-organic frameworks, and ionic liquids enhanced their adsorption capacity by either increasing the surface area or providing multiple retention mechanisms. Monoliths with molecular recognition properties for highly selective extractions have been synthesized, including boronic functionalities and molecularly imprinted cavities. The final part describes the hybrid organic silica monoliths, emphasizing metal ions and speciation analysis hyphenated with ICP-MS. In the outlook section, we point to some fields we believe monoliths will benefit, such as their 3-D technologies preparation. We also pointed their potential applicability in portable chromatographic systems, restricted access materials, and enhanced use to preconcentrate viruses from aquatic environments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Antibiotics are a typical group of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) with emerging pollutant effects. The presence of residual antibiotics in the environment is a prominent issue owing to their potential hazards, toxic effects, and persistence. Several treatments have been carried out in aquatic environments in order to eliminate antibiotic residues. Among these, photodegradation is regarded as an environmentally-friendly and efficient option. Indirect photodegradation is the main pathway for the degradation of residual antibiotics in natural water, as opposed to direct photodegradation. Algae, working as photosensitizers, play an important role in the indirect photolysis of residual antibiotics in natural water bodies. They promote this reaction by secreting extracellular organic matters (EOMs) and inducing the generation of active species. In order to provide a thorough understanding of the effects of algae on residual antibiotic degradation in the environment, this paper comprehensively reviews the latest research regarding algae-induced antibiotic photodegradation. The summary of the different pathways and photosensitive mechanisms involved in this process show that EOMs are indispensable to antibiotic photodegradation. The influencing factors of algae-induced photodegradation are also discussed here: these include algae species, antibiotic types, and environmental variables such as light source, ferric ion presence, temperature, and ultrasound treatment. Based on the review of existing literature, this paper also considers several pathways for the future study of algae-induced antibiotic photodegradation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Effects of maternal PFOA exposure on offspring as well as the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, ICR mouse models of gestational low PFOA exposure (0.05 mg/kg/day) were established to investigate the roles on metabolic disorders of offspring. Body weight, body composition, hepatic lipid levels, transcriptome and metabolome were analyzed. Expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, inflammasome formation and gut barrier integrity were measured. Furthermore, oral administration of chlorogenic acid (CGA) (100 mg/kg/day) was performed to observe the rescue effect on lipid disorders caused by PFOA exposure. Our findings demonstrated that gestational exposure to PFOA resulted in obesity, hepatic inflammation, disorders of lipid metabolism, and disruption of gut barrier integrity in male offspring. Notably, these adverse effects were attenuated by CGA supplementation. These data suggested that PFOA exposure during early life stage induced potential risks for later onset of obesity and metabolic disorder which could be ameliorated by CGA treatment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a class of synthetic chemicals produced for over 70 years, are of increasing concern because of their widespread environmental presence, extreme persistence, bioaccumulative nature, and evidence for health effects from environmentally relevant exposures. In 2016, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) established nonregulatory drinking water Health Advisories of 70 ng/L for individual and total concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), the 8-carbon perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) that are the most thoroughly studied PFAS. As of May 2020, 9 US states had concluded that the USEPA Health Advisories are insufficiently protective and developed more stringent PFOA and PFOS guidelines. In addition, 10 states had developed guidelines for other PFAS, primarily PFAAs. This Critical Review discusses the scientific basis for state and USEPA drinking water guidelines for PFOA and PFOS; the same principles apply to guidelines for other PFAS. Similarities and differences among guidelines arise from both toxicity and exposure considerations. The approximately 4-fold range among state guidelines (8–35 ng/L for PFOA, 10–40 ng/L for PFOS) is not large or unexpected for guidelines developed by different scientists at different time points, especially when compared with older USEPA and state guidelines that were generally several orders of magnitude higher. Additional state guidelines for PFOA, PFOS, and other PFAS are expected to become available. Environ Toxicol Chem 2021;40:560–563. © 2020 SETAC. © 2020 SETAC},

abstract={Due to their health effects and the recalcitrant nature of their C[sbnd]F bonds, Poly- and Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) are widely investigated for their distribution, remediation, and toxicology in ecosystems. However, very few studies have focused on modeling PFAS in the soil-water environment. In this review, we summarized the recent development in PFAS modeling for various chemical, physical, and biological processes, including sorption, volatilization, degradation, bioaccumulation, and transport. PFAS sorption is kinetic in nature with sorption equilibrium commonly quantified by either a linear, the Freundlich, or the Langmuir isotherms. Volatilization of PFAS depends on carbon chain length and ionization status and has been simulated by a two-layer diffusion process across the air water interface. First-order kinetics is commonly used for physical, chemical, and biological degradation processes. Uptake by plants and other biota can be passive and/or active. As surfactants, PFAS have a tendency to be sorbed or concentrated on air-water or non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL)-water interfaces, where the same three isotherms for soil sorption are adopted. PFAS transport in the soil-water environment is simulated by solving the convection-dispersion equation (CDE) that is coupled to PFAS sorption, phase transfer, as well as physical, chemical, and biological transformations. As the physicochemical properties and concentration vary greatly among the potentially thousands of PFAS species in the environment, systematic efforts are needed to identify models and model parameters to simulate their fate, transport, and response to remediation techniques. Since many process formulations are empirical in nature, mechanistic approaches are needed to further the understanding of PFAS-soil-water-plant interactions so that the model parameters are less site dependent and more predictive in simulating PFAS remediation efficiency. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Despite increasing regulation, exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) remains a serious public health concern due to their accumulation in the environment and ability to biomagnify up the food chain. POPs are associated with endocrine-disrupting effects including adverse reproductive outcomes that could affect fecundability, i.e. the capacity to conceive a pregnancy, quantified as time to pregnancy (TTP). OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Results of epidemiologic studies that examine the impact of various chemical classes of POPs on TTP have not been synthesised. We undertook a systematic review to summarise the strength of evidence for associations of four common groups of POPs with couple fecundability and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature in order to inform policy decisions and future research. SEARCH METHODS: We performed an electronic search of literature published between 1 January 2007 and 6 August 2019 in MEDLINE, EMBASE.com, Global Health, DART/TOXLINE and POPLINE. We included empirical research papers that examined human exposure to organochlorine (OC) pesticides, brominated flame retardants, polychlorinated organic compounds and/or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and considered TTP or fecundability as an outcome. Standardised forms for screening, data extraction and study quality were developed using DistillerSR software, and all reviews were completed in duplicate. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias and devised additional quality metrics based on specific methodological features of fecundability studies. OUTCOMES: The search returned 4573 articles, and 28 papers from 19 different studies met inclusion criteria. Among them, four studies measured TTP prospectively, three had data on participants' prenatal exposure, three examined associations in both male and female partners and one focused exclusively on males. Analyses varied widely in terms of exposure characterisation, precluding a meta-analytic approach. Evidence was strongest for adverse associations of female exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls with TTP, with some additional support for associations of female exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers and PFAS with longer TTP. Our review provided little or no support for associations between female exposure to OC pesticides or male exposure to any of the POP groups and TTP. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Evidence suggests that female exposure to at least some POPs may reduce fecundability. Although many of these chemicals are no longer in production, they are still detectable in human biosamples because of their persistence in the environment. Replacement chemicals that are being introduced as older ones are restricted may have similar reproductive consequences. Future studies should examine these newer POPs, assess interactions between POPs and other chemical and non-chemical exposures, investigate how POPs are distributed in and metabolised by the human body and focus on populations that may be disproportionately exposed. © The Author(s) 2020.

abstract={The separation of organic liquid mixtures by organic solvent reverse osmosis (OSRO) technology is promising owing to the high energy-efficiency. This article presents an overview of the endeavors made in the OSRO separation of organic liquid mixtures. First, the sub-nanometer separation characteristic of OSRO is introduced, and compared with pervaporation and organic solvent nanofiltration. Next, the mixtures of interest which may benefit from OSRO technology such as polar/nonpolar mixtures and their application scenarios are presented. The energy evaluation of OSRO, pervaporation, and distillation processes is also performed, highlighting the energy conservation feature of OSRO process. Subsequently, the OSRO membranes developed to date are comprehensively reviewed in term of their membrane materials, diving into organic (mainly cellulose types, polyethylene, polyamide, perfluoropolymer), inorganic (carbon molecular sieves, silica, zeolite), and composite (polymers of intrinsic microporosity-1/AlOx) materials. The OSRO separation performances of the developed membranes are summarized and compared in term of flux and separation factor. Finally, we provide perspectives regarding the challenges and state the concluding remarks, in the hope that this review will inspire future studies to address efficient OSRO separations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Introduction: Humans are exposed to multiple environmental chemicals via different sources resulting in complex real-life exposure patterns. Insight into these patterns is important for applications such as linkage to health effects and (mixture) risk assessment. By providing internal exposure levels of (metabolites of) chemicals, biomonitoring studies can provide snapshots of exposure patterns and factors that drive them. Presentation of biomonitoring data in networks facilitates the detection of such exposure patterns and allows for the systematic comparison of observed exposure patterns between datasets and strata within datasets. Methods: We demonstrate the use of network techniques in human biomonitoring data from cord blood samples collected in three campaigns of the Flemish Environment and Health Studies (FLEHS) (sampling years resp. 2002–2004, 2008–2009, and 2013–2014). Measured biomarkers were multiple organochlorine compounds, PFAS and metals. Comparative network analysis (CNA) was conducted to systematically compare networks between sampling campaigns, smoking status during pregnancy, and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. Results: Network techniques offered an intuitive approach to visualize complex correlation structures within human biomonitoring data. The identification of groups of highly connected biomarkers, “communities,” within these networks highlighted which biomarkers should be considered collectively in the analysis and interpretation of epidemiological studies or in the design of toxicological mixture studies. Network analyses demonstrated in our example to which extent biomarker networks and its communities changed across the sampling campaigns, smoking status during pregnancy, and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. Conclusion: Network analysis is a data-driven and intuitive screening method when dealing with multiple exposure biomarkers, which can easily be upscaled to high dimensional HBM datasets, and can inform mixture risk assessment approaches. © Copyright © 2021 Ottenbros, Govarts, Lebret, Vermeulen, Schoeters and Vlaanderen.},

abstract={Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide affecting all age groups from children to the elderly. In addition to other factors such as smoking, air pollution and atopy, some environmental chemicals are shown or suspected to increase the risk of asthma, exacerbate asthma symptoms and cause other respiratory symptoms. In this scoping review, we report environmental chemicals, prioritized for investigation in the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU), which are associated or possibly associated with asthma. The substance groups con-sidered to cause asthma through specific sensitization include: diisocyanates, hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) and possibly p-phenylenediamine (p-PDA). In epidemiological studies, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organophosphate insecticides are associated with asthma, and phthalates, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), pyrethroid insecticides, mercury, cad-mium, arsenic and lead are only potentially associated with asthma. As a conclusion, exposure to PAHs and some pesticides are associated with increased risk of asthma. Diisocyanates and Cr(VI) cause asthma with specific sensitization. For many environmental chemicals, current studies have provided contradicting results in relation to increased risk of asthma. Therefore, more research about exposure to environmental chemicals and risk of asthma is needed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Abstract: Biofilms lead to approximately 65% of infections, and these infections are hard to treat. Thus, it is crucial to identify effective antibiofilm agents with low cytotoxicity. Peptides with antibiofilm activity have been regarded as promising solutions, and peptides with MBICs (minimal biofilm inhibitory concentrations) that are lower than their minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) (minimal inhibitory concentrations) are appealing. Therefore, we systematically summarized and classified previously reported peptides with antibiofilm activity. A total of 51 peptides with antibiofilm activity were classified into 14 categories. The MICs and MBICs of these fourteen representative peptides, one selected from each category, were compared against the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus mutans, the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the fungus Candida albicans. Six representative peptides (C5-pleurocidin, C6-Pac-525, C9-protegrin-1, C11-TetraF2W-RR, C13-WLBU2, and C14-melittin) showed antibiofilm activity against both bacteria and fungi, and among these 6 representative peptides, 4 peptides (C9-protegrin-1, C11-TetraF2W-RR, C13-WLBU2, and C14-melittin) could prevent biofilm formation with lower MBIC values than their MICs. CLSM (confocal laser scanning microscopy), SEM (scanning electron microscopy), and TEM (transmission electron microscopy) were further used to observe the morphologies of the biofilms after treatment with the peptides. Among the above 4 peptides, WLBU2 and melittin sparsely scattered the biofilms without destroying the bacteria. In conclusion, the currently reported peptides with antibiofilm activity are limited in number, but peptides with lower MBICs than MICs exist as promising candidates against biofilm-related infections and need further study. Key points: • Antibiofilm peptides could inhibit biofilm formation with MBICs that are lower than MICs. • The mechanism of antibiofilm peptides is not only due to antimicrobial activity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Saccharomyces cerevisiae acts as a bio-foundry for producing natural products. S. cerevisiae's intrinsic pathways highlight microbial cell factories to produce pharmaceutics, food additive, and fine chemicals. For high-titer, yield, and conversion of target compounds, the critical point is that fine-tuning and optimizing intracellular metabolic flux in the yeast cell. Acetyl- CoA is the fundamental precursor for central metabolism and heterologous pathway. In comparison, acetyl-CoA compartmentalizes in mitochondria, nucleus, peroxisome subcellular, and cytosol. Most of the pathway enzymes are expressed in S. cerevisiae cytosol. So, we summarized the fine-tuning strategies of acetyl-CoA synthesis in cytosol matrix. The new acetyl-CoA pathway (phosphoketolase, phosphotransacetylase, and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, PK/PTA-ADA) shows a high conversion ratio from the carbon source. The PK/PTA-ADA pathway presents improved redox balance, limited ATP requirement, and reduced carbon loss to CO2. Moreover, the heterologous ATP-dependent citrate lyase precisely converts mitochondria metabolism into acetyl-CoA. Knock-out acetyl-CoA depletion pathways retain high acetyl-CoA titer in the cytosol. The continuous metabolic engineering on PK/PTA-ADA pathway is expected for higher acetyl-CoA titer. The Mevalonate pathway has been engineered to produce terpenoids in S. cerevisiae. The exogenous HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase boost mevalonate pathway from acetyl-CoA. Further, the diversified terpenoids are generated from C5 unite Isopentenyl diphosphate and its' isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate. Intrinsic farnesyl diphosphate synthase (Erg20) shows both dimethylallyltransferase (geranyl diphosphate, C10 product) and geranyltransferase (farnesyl diphosphate, C15 product) activity. The F96W/N127W mutations in Erg20 caused steric hindrance for geranyl diphosphate substrate. So, geranyl diphosphate is accumulated to produce C10 terpenoids or meroterpenoids. Moreover, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (CrtE) convert farnesyl diphosphate (C15) into geranylgeranyl diphosphate (C20) for carotene, lycopene, astaxanthin, and taxol, etc. Interestingly, the novel isopentenol utilization pathway has been constructed in E. coli and Y. lipolytica to supply IPP and IMAPP precursors from isopentanol. This alternative pathway could relieve the acetyl- CoA supply burden in the mevalonate pathway. Fatty acid synthase (FAS) produces fatty acid with specific carbon length and derivatives from acetyl-CoA and malonyl- CoA. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1) catalyzes acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA, which is utilized as the carbon unite in fatty acid pathway. Overexpression of ACC1 and mitochondria located isoenzyme Hfa1 significantly improves fatty acid production. FAS in S. cerevisiae is an α6β6 heterodimer protein and these catalytic domains are engineered to produce specific fatty acids. Directed mutations in ketoacyl synthase (KS), acetyltransferase (AT), and malonyl/palmitoyl transferase (MPT) domains engage FAS to generate high-yield short/medium fatty acid (C6 and C8). Furthermore, fatty acid reductase and acyl-ACP reductase convert fatty acid or fatty acyl-ACP to fatty aldehydes, respectively. Aldehyde deformylating oxygenase produces alkanes from fatty aldehydes substrate. Significantly, fatty acid-derived bio hydrocarbons showed closets properties to petroleum fuel. We reviewed the metabolic strategies of acetyl-CoA synthesis, the novel mevalonate pathway and fatty acid synthesis. These strategies may be valuable for producing high-yield terpene and fatty acid derivatives in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. © 2021, Science Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={This study reports seasonal variations of meteorological parameters, atmospheric dust and dust-borne heavy metals concentrations measured, over a period of two years, next to two major airports (Dubai International Airport and Abu Dhabi International Airport) in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. On-line monitoring stations were installed at each location next to dust samplers used to frequently collect PM2.5 and PM10 on Teflon filters for metal analysis. Clear seasonal variation in meteorological parameters were identified. The particulate matter concentrations depicted from the two locations were continuously monitored. The PM2.5 concentration ranged from 50 to 100 μg/m3 on normal days but reached 350–400 μg/m3 per day during mild storms. The PM10 levels ranged between 100 and 250 μg/m3 during normal days and spiked to 750 μg/m3 during mild storms. Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDS) revealed the presence of significant amounts of alkali and alkaline earth metals, which pose potential harm to aircraft engines. ICP analysis showed the presence of heavy and toxic metals in concentrations that may pose harm to human health. Bulk sand samples from Abu Dhabi sites showed chemical similarities to the atmospheric dust samples. The concentrations of heavy metals, PM2.5, and PM10 are at levels that require further monitoring due to their impact on human health. The two years meteorological monitoring, with the seasonal variations, provided additional regional data in the Arabian Gulf. Furthermore, the study concluded that Sand and Dust storms (SDS) occur more frequently at the northern Arabian Gulf compared to its southern region. The chemical correlation between atmospheric dust and regional desert sand suggests the localized origin of the smaller dust particles that may form by breaking apart of the ground sand grains. As a result of the ongoing urbanization in the region, it is essential to collect additional data from various locations for a longer period of time. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Introduction: Osteoporosis is a disease having adverse effects on bone health and causing fragility fractures. Osteoporosis affects approximately 200 million people worldwide, and nearly 9 million fractures occur annually. Evidence exists that, in addition to traditional risk factors, certain environmental substances may increase the risk of osteoporosis. Methods: The European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU) is a joint program coordinating and advancing human biomonitoring in Europe. HBM4EU investigates citizens’ exposure to several environmental substances and their plausible health effects aiming to contribute to policymaking. In HBM4EU, 18 priority substances or substance groups were selected. For each, a scoping document was prepared summarizing existing knowledge and health effects. This scoping review is based on these chemical-specific scoping documents and complementary literature review. Results: A possible link between osteoporosis and the body burden of heavy metals, such as cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), and industrial chemicals such as phthalates and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) was identified. Conclusions: Evidence shows that environmental substances may be related to osteoporosis as an adverse health effect. Nevertheless, more epidemiological research on the relationship between health effects and exposure to these chemicals is needed. Study results are incoherent, and pervasive epidemiological studies regarding the chemical exposure are lacking. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Endometriosis is a gynecological disorder characterized by the presence of endometrial stroma and glands outside the uterine cavity. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to clarify, starting from environmental exposure data, whether possible occupational risk factors may correlate with the onset of the disease. The guidelines for reporting systematic reviews of the “PRISMA” statement were followed and two databases, Scopus and PubMed, were used. Of the 422 studies selected with specific keywords, 32 publications were eligible, 28 of which referred to chemical agents and 4 related to night work. Conflicting data emerged among these studies. Although some compounds seemed to be more involved than others in the onset of endometriosis. Association with exposure to organochlorine compounds is the most supported by the epidemiological data, while other pesticide exposure did not show any clear correlation. Likewise, the hypothesis of a correlation with perfluoroalkyls exposure is not currently supported by data. The involvement of metals as risk factors has not been confirmed, while the role of night work, in the case of long service, seems to play an etiological role. In order to clarify the potential occupational risk of endometriosis development, well-designed studies are needed to evaluate the potential association between chemical compounds and disease etiology. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Characteristic emerging pollutants at low concentration have raised much attention for causing a bottleneck in water remediation, especially in complex water matrices where high concentration of interferents coexist. In the future, tailored treatment methods are therefore of increasing significance for accurate removal of target pollutants in different water matrices. This critical review focuses on the overall strategies for accurately removing highly toxic emerging pollutants in the presence of typical interferents. The main difficulties hindering the improvement of selectivity in complex matrices are analyzed, implying that it is difficult to adopt a universal approach for multiple targets and water substrates. Selective methods based on assorted principles are proposed aiming to improve the anti-interference ability. Thus, typical approaches and fundamentals to achieve selectivity are subsequently summarized including their mechanism, superiority and inferior position, application scope, improvement method and the bottlenecks. The results show that different methods may be applicable to certain conditions and target pollutants. To better understand the mechanism of each selective method and further select the appropriate method, advanced methods for qualitative and quantitative characterization of selectivity are presented. The processes of adsorption, interaction, electron transfer, and bond breaking are discussed. Some comparable selective quantitative methods are helpful for promoting the development of related fields. The research framework of selectivity removal and its fundamentals are established. Presently, although continuous advances and remarkable achievements have been attained in the selective removal of characteristic organic pollutants, there are still various substantial challenges and opportunities. It is hopeful to inspire the researches on the new generation of water and wastewater treatment technology, which can selectively and preferentially treat characteristic pollutants, and establish a reliable research framework to lead the direction of environmental science. ©},

Here, we explore the concept and general data analysis framework of "molecular gatekeepers"-key metabolites that link single or multiple exposure biomarkers with correlated clusters of endogenous metabolites-to inform health-relevant biological targets. We performed untargeted metabolomics on plasma from 152 adolescent girls participating in the Growing Up Healthy Study in New York City. We then performed network analysis to link metabolites to exposure biomarkers including five trace elements (Cd, Mn, Pb, Se, and Hg) and five perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs; n-PFOS, Sm-PFOS, n-PFOA, PFHxS, and PFNA). We found 144 molecular gatekeepers and annotated 22 of them. Lysophosphatidylcholine (16:0) and taurodeoxycholate were correlated with both n-PFOA and n-PFOS, suggesting a shared dysregulation from multiple xenobiotic exposures. Sphingomyelin (d18:2/14:0) was significantly associated with age at menarche; yet, no direct association was detected between any exposure biomarkers and age at menarche. Thus, molecular gatekeepers can also discover molecular linkages between exposure biomarkers and health outcomes that may otherwise be obscured by complex interactions in direct measurements. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

This study assesses the clinical effects of ERAS in RRP. Methods: Various databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and China National Knowledge were searched for relevant studies, in particular full-text articles comparing ERAS groups and conventional groups for RRP. All included articles were subject to a quality assessment, and the data analysis was conducted with Review Manager (5.3). Forest plots, sensitivity analyses, and bias analyses were also prepared based on the included articles. Results: In total, 8 studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that ERAS groups exhibited significantly reduced time of flatus [mean difference (MD) =-0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.88, -0.29; P=0.0001], time of catheter removal (MD =-1.65; 95% CI: -2.15, -1.16; P<0.00001), and length of stay (LOS) (MD =-1.49; 95% CI: -2.65, -0.34; P=0.01), and there was no significant difference in terms of postoperative complications between ERAS groups and conventional groups (P=0.07). Discussion: This study provides further evidence that ERAS improves postoperative recovery in patients undergoing RRP through reduced time of first flatus, time of catheter removal and LOS. Given the limited quality and quantity of the articles included in this study, further work is needed to validate these findings. © 2021 Gland Surgery. All Rights Reserved.},

In this study, we examined the hypothesis of gene-disease interactions in an in-silico model of gene expression to seek changes in cytochrome P450 genes. The Gene Expression Omnibus dataset of the liver autopsy in deceased COVID-19 patients (GSE150316) was used in this study. Non-alcoholic fatty liver biopsies were used as the control (GSE167523). Besides, gene expression analysis was performed using the DESeq/EdgeR method. The GO databases were used, and the paths were set at p<0.05. The drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb) was searched for in-teractions. According to the results, 5,147 genes were downregulated, and 5,122 genes were upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 compared to healthy livers. Compared to the cytochromes, 34 cytochromes were downregulated, while 4 cytochromes were upregulated among the detected differentially expressed genes (DEG). The drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb) provided a list of medications with potential interactions with COVID-19 as well as metacetamol, phenethyl iso-cyanate, amodiaquine, spironolactone, amiloride, acenocoumarol, clopidogrel, phenprocoumon, trimipramine, phenazepam, etc. Besides, dietary compounds of isoflavones, valerian, and coumarin, as well as caffeine metabolism were shown to have possible interactions with COVID-19 disease. Our study showed that expression levels of cytochrome P450 genes could get altered following COVID-19. In addition, a drug-disease interaction list is recommended to be used for evalua-tions in clinical considerations in further studies. © 2021, Instituto de Investigaciones Clinicas.

abstract={Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) refer to a group of chemicals that cause adverse effects in human health, impairing hormone production and regulation, resulting in alteration of homeostasis, reproductive, and developmental, and immune system impairments. The immunotoxicity of EDCs involves many mechanisms altering gene expression that depend on the activation of nuclear receptors such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the estrogen receptor (ER), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which also results in skin and intestinal disorders, microbiota alterations and inflammatory diseases. This systematic review aims to review different mechanisms of immunotoxicity and immunomodulation of T cells, focusing on T regulatory (Treg) and Th17 subsets, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) caused by specific EDCs such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), bisphenols (BPs) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). To achieve this objective, a systematic study was conducted searching various databases including PubMed and Scopus to find in-vitro, in-vivo, and biomonitoring studies that examine EDC-dependent mechanisms of immunotoxicity. While doing the systematic review, we found species- and cell-specific outcomes and a translational gap between in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. Finally, an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework is proposed, which explains mechanistically toxicity endpoints emerging from different EDCs having similar key events and can help to improve our understanding of EDCs mechanisms of immunotoxicity. In conclusion, this review provides insights into the mechanisms of immunotoxicity mediated by EDCs and will help to improve human health risk assessment. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In this paper, we comprehensively reviewed the progress of NF-based drinking water treatment, through summarizing the development of materials/fabrication and applications of NF membranes in various scenarios including surface water treatment, groundwater treatment, water reuse, brackish water treatment, and point of use applications. We not only summarized the removal of target major pollutants (e.g., hardness, pathogen, and natural organic matter), but also paid attention to the removal of micropollutants of major concern (e.g., disinfection byproducts, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and arsenic). We highlighted that, for different applications, fit-for-purpose design is needed to improve the separation capability for target compounds of NF membranes in addition to their removal of salts. Outlook and perspectives on membrane fouling control, chlorine resistance, integrity, and selectivity are also discussed to provide potential insights for future development of high-efficiency NF membranes for stable and reliable drinking water treatment.

abstract={Extensive use of these harmful dyes has resulted in the surplus presence of these emerging pollutants in the environment, thus demanding an instant and sensitive detection method. Various synthetic dyes are illegitimately mixed into food and other consuming items for displaying bright colours that attracts consumers. The synthetic dyes cause a number of environmental health hazards and promote toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity in humans. Despite these serious health glitches, synthetic dyes are widely used due to their much lower cost. As a result, a faster, more selective and extremely sensitive technology for detecting and quantifying hazardous dyes in trace amount is urgently needed. This topic is currently in its initial phases of development and needs continuous refinements, such as explaining various sensing methods and potential future uses linked with dye detection technologies. The present review encompasses a comprehensive literature survey on detection of dyes and latest progress in developing sensors for dye detection and summarizes different detection mechanisms, including biosensor-, optical- and electrochemical-based sensors. Detection methodologies are examined with a focus on biosensor-based recent advancements in dye detection and the growing demand for more appropriate systems in terms of accuracy and efficiency. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Some environmental chemicals capable of interfering with the endocrine regulation of energy metabolism and the structure of adipose tissue in the function of the reproductive, immune, cardiovascular and other systems are called endocrine disruptors or disruptors. According to the WHO definition, the term «endocrine disruptors» means: «Exogenous substances or mixtures thereof that alter the function (s) of the endocrine system and, as a result, cause adverse effects in the intact organism or in its offspring, or (sub) population.» This includes compounds to which humanity is exposed in daily life as a result of their use in pesticides, herbicides, industrial and household products, plastics, detergents, refractory impregnations and as ingredients in personal care products. This review will present the latest scientific data on various ERs, such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs): pesticides (mirex, chlordecane, endosulfan, hexachlorobenzene-HCB dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane-DDT and its metabolites), industrial chemicals (bisphenol A, polybrominated ether -PBDE, polychlorinated biphenyls-PCB, nonylphenol, dioxins, perfluorooctanoic acid-PFOA, phthalates), pharmaceuticals (diethylstilbestrol-DES). ERs are regarded as compounds that cause obesity, since they have the ability to influence cellular processes associated with adipose tissue, initiating changes in lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. Analysis of scientific materials on this issue indicates that ERs are ubiquitous in the environment and have a detrimental effect on the health of animals and mankind. The scientific and practical interest in this article is based on the growing statistics of the development of such socially significant pathologies as obesity and related diseases, including diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, menstrual irregularities, as well as cancer and infertility, for of which obesity is a risk factor. © 2021 Russian Association of Endocrinologists.

Cytostatic drugs are emerging pollutants used for cancer treatment found in hospital and domestic wastewater. Small amounts of cytostatic pollutants may pose severe health problems in human beings, animals, and plants after prolonged contact. This research presents a general review of some water treatment methods, such as aerobic activated sludge, enzymatic degradation, nanofiltration and chlorination, that have been used for the degradation or elimination of cytostatic drugs in wastewater. In recent years, photocatalysis has become important to solve this problem; these advanced oxidation process uses pure and modified TiO2 to degrade cytostatic contaminants and convert them into non-harmful substances or to eliminate them completely. This work contains a comprehensive review of the heterogeneous photocatalysis process and mechanism, and its application on the removal of cytostatic pollutants. Even if research on the topic is still scarce, this literature review provides interesting highlights on the scope of the research field, and the path such research could follow. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Yet, for many, toxic exposures signal life-changing or life-ending events, phantom threats that fail to appear as such until they become too late to mitigate. Assessments of toxicological risk consist of what Sheila Jasanoff calls “sociotechnical imaginaries,” arbitrations between calculated costs and benefits, known risks and scientifically wrought justifications of safety. Prevalent financial conflicts of interest and the socially determined hazards posed by chemical exposure suggest that chemical safety assessments and regulations are a form of postnormal science. Focusing on the histories of risk assessments of pesticides such as DDT, atrazine, PFAS, and glyphosate, this article critically reviews Michel Serres's notion of “appropriation by contamination.” © 2021.

Current treatment options show unsatisfactory results and new ones are therefore needed. Stem cell (SC) therapy might be an alternative treatment strategy. This systematic review aims to define the state of art of SC therapy for PFDs in clinical trials, by systematically reviewing the available evidence. A systematic search strategy was conducted up to November 7, 2020, in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Science. Preclinical studies on animal models were not considered. Studies were included when the patients were affected by any PFDs and cells were isolated, cultured, and characterized as SC. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020216551). A total of 11 prospective clinical studies were included in the final assessment, specifically 7 single-arm studies dealing with SC therapy for stress urinary incontinence and 4 with anal incontinence. Among the latter, there were two prospective, single-arm studies and two randomized controlled trials. No papers concerning the use of SC for prolapse repair were retrieved. Due to the great heterogeneity, data pooling was not possible. Stem cell injection resulted in a safe procedure, with few mild adverse side effects, mostly related to harvesting sites. However, a clear beneficial impact of SC treatment for the treatment of pelvic floor disorders could not be demonstrated. Further larger targeted studies with control arms are needed before any conclusions can be made. © 2021, The Author(s).},

In recent years, FTS has emerged as a prime target for stress research due to its highly controlled nature and its significant impact on the game outcome. In this narrative review, we appraise empirical research with a social-psychological focus on studying FTS success under pressure. This critical review comprises 44 empirical studies published up to June 2020. We first assess the importance of FTS within the game of basketball and study historical trends. We then elaborate on the unique psychological features of FTS. Subsequently, research on the undermining effects of pressure from both archival game studies and experiments is critically evaluated. We conclude with a discussion of performance in relationship to expertise and sources of threat. The review highlights current research deficiencies, provides recommendations for theoretical research and applied practice. © 2021 International Society of Sport Psychology.},

abstract={An alkaline esterase, designated as EstXT1, was identified through functional screening from a metagenomic library. Sequence analysis revealed that EstXT1 belonged to the family VIII carboxylesterases and contained a characteristic conserved S-x-x-K motif and a deduced catalytic triad Ser56-Lys59-Tyr165. EstXT1 exhibited the strongest activity toward methyl ferulate at pH 8.0 and temperature 55°C and retained over 80% of its original activity after incubation in the pH range of 7.0–10.6 buffers. Biochemical characterization of the recombinant enzyme showed that it was activated by Zn2+ and Co2+ metal ion, while inhibited by Cu2+ and CTAB. EstXT1 exhibited significant promiscuous acyltransferase activity preferred to the acylation of benzyl alcohol acceptor using short-chain pNP-esters (C2-C8) as acyl-donors. A structure–function analysis indicated that a WAG motif is essential to acyltransferase activity. This is the first report example that WAG motif plays a pivotal role in acyltransferase activity in family VIII carboxylesterases beside WGG motif. Further experiment indicated that EstXT1 successfully acylated cyanidin-3-O-glucoside in aqueous solution. The results from the current investigation provided new insights for the family VIII carboxylesterase and lay a foundation for the potential applications of EstXT1 in food and biotechnology fields. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) has aroused public concerns as it can pose multiple health threats to pregnant women and cause adverse birth outcomes for fetuses. In previous studies, the prenatal exposure levels and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTE) of PFASs have been reported and discussed. Specifically, the binding affinities between PFASs and some transporters were determined, demonstrating that the TTE values of PFASs are highly dependent on their binding behaviors. To summarize primary findings of previous studies and propose potential guidance for future research, this article provides a systematic overview on levels and characteristics of prenatal exposure to PFASs worldwide, summarizes relationships between TTE values and structures of PFASs, and discusses possible transplacental transfer mechanisms, especially for the combination between PFASs and transporters. Given the critical roles of transporters in the transplacental transfer of PFASs, we conducted molecular docking to further clarify the binding behaviors between PFASs and the selected transporters. We proposed that the machine learning can be a superior method to predict and reveal behaviors and mechanisms of the transplacental transfer of PFASs. In total, this is the first review providing a comprehensive overview on the prenatal exposure levels and transplacental transfer mechanisms of PFASs. © 2021 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={A challenge in the development of novel 18F-labelled positron emission tomography (PET) imaging probes is identification of metabolically stable sites to incorporate the 18F radioisotope. Metabolic loss of 18F from PET probes in vivo can lead to misleading biodistribution data as displaced 18F can accumulate in various tissues. In this study we report on in vitro hepatic microsomal metabolism of novel caffeine containing bifunctional compounds (C8-6-I, C8-6-N, C8-6-C8) that can prevent in vitro aggregation of α-synuclein, which is associated with the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease. The metabolic profile obtained guided us to synthesize stable isotope 19F-labelled analogues in which the fluorine was introduced at the metabolically stable N7 of the caffeine moiety. An in vitro hepatic microsomal metabolism study of the 19F-labelled analogues resulted in similar metabolites to the unlabelled compounds and demonstrated that the fluorine was metabolically stable, suggesting that these analogues are appropriate PET imaging probes. This straightforward in vitro strategy is valuable for avoiding costly stability failures when designing radiolabelled compounds for PET imaging. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), ubiquitous persistent environmental contaminants, has led to substantial global concern due to their potential environmental and human health effects. Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between PFAS exposure and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the results are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFAS and MetS. We performed a systematic search strategy using three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies concerning the associations of PFAS with MetS and its clinical relevance from inception until January 2021. We undertook meta-analyses where there were five or more studies with exposure and outcomes assessments that were reasonably comparable. The pooled odd ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects models and heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 index and Q test. A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (10 studies on the general population and two studies in the occupational settings) investigated the association between PFAS exposure and MetS. We pooled data from seven studies on the general population for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and five studies for perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Predominately, most studies reported no statistically significant association between concentrations of PFAS and MetS. In the meta-analysis, the overall measure of effect was not statistically significant, showing no evidence of an association between concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS and the risk of MetS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, current small body of evidence does not support association between PFAS and MetS. However, due to limited number of studies and substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Further scrutinizing cohort studies are needed to evaluate the association between various and less well-known PFAS substances and their mixture with MetS and its components in both adults and children in different settings. © 2021 Maryam Zare Jeddi et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2021.},

An exam demonstrated anterior chamber (AC) reaction, vitritis, multifocal patches of whitening, and an occlusive retinal vasculitis. A superior pigmented chorioretinal scar with overlying contracted vitreous was noted in the periphery with no adjacent retinal whitening. The patient was treated for both ARN and toxoplasma chorioretinitis until PCR study of the vitreous and AC returned positive for HSV-2 and negative for toxoplasmosis. Management consisted of a dual therapy regimen of both oral and intravitreal antiviral agents as well as oral corticosteroids. The patient's clinical course was complicated by rhegmatogenous retinal detachment within 2 weeks after symptom onset, requiring pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil and intraoperative intraocular incubation with foscarnet.

abstract={Introduction: Despite recent developments, surgical treatment of retinal detachment secondary to macular hole (MHRD) in myopic patients remains a challenge. This review aims to compare the success rate of two recently emerged surgical approaches: internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling or inverted flap with intraocular tamponade as surgical treatment for MHRD in high myopia. Areas covered: This article primarily includes the following sections: literature searches, selection study and assessment, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and statistical analysis. Fifteen studies covering 362 patients were included and reviewed to compare the success rate of different surgical approaches, ILM peeling vs. inverted flap and intraocular tamponade as an adjunct to pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for treatment of MHRD. Expert opinion: There is evidence that the anatomical surgical success rate (macular hole closure and retinal reattachment) of the PPV with inverted ILM flap is higher than the conventional ILM peeling. Also, regarding the proper intraocular tamponade, long-term types have increased the success rate of surgery, so perfluoropropane (C3F8) and silicone oil (SO) are preferred over sulfur-hexafluoride (SF6). So, this review introduces PPV combined with inverted ILM flap and adjuvant long-term intraocular endotamponade as mainstream surgical methods for MHRD in myopic patients. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare outcomes of PFA and TKA by evaluation of the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Methods: We systematically identified publications reporting on patients that underwent either TKA or modern PFA for isolated PFOA. Meta-analysis software was used to screen for potential articles with at least two years’ follow-up. Data were extracted and analysed for all PROMs operating time, postoperative inpatient time, complications and cost. We included five studies in our cumulative meta-analysis and reviewed them using Review Manager V.5.0. We computed the risk ratio as a measure of the treatment effect, taking into account heterogeneity. We used random-effect models. Results: No significant difference was found between both TKA and PFA in the context of operating time. No significant difference after five years’ follow-up was found between the two treatment options in terms of UCLA score and patient satisfaction. PFA showed significant improvement in WOMAC score at five-year follow-up, less postoperative inpatient time, better cost-effectiveness and significantly less blood loss. Conclusion: PFA seems to be a viable alternative to TKA for treatment of isolated PFOA in appropriately selected patients. PFA showed less postoperative inpatient time and blood loss with similar PROMs to the TKA. Moreover, it is an economically beneficial joint-preserving procedure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background: Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) are ubiquitous substances that are found in our everyday lives, including pesticides, plasticizers, pharmaceutical agents, personal care products, and also in food products and food packaging. Increasing epidemiological evidence suggest that EDCs may affect the development or progression of breast cancer and consequently lead to lifelong harmful health consequences, especially when exposure occurs during early life in humans. Yet so far no appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic. Objective: To systematically review all the available epidemiological studies about the association of the levels of environmental exposures of EDCs with breast cancer risk. Methods: The search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved articles from PubMed (MEDLINE) until 10 March 2021. The key words used in this research were: “Endocrine disruptor(s)” OR “Endocrine disrupting chemical(s)” OR any of the EDCs mentioned below AND “Breast cancer” to locate all relevant articles published. We included only cohort studies and case-control studies. All relevant articles were accessed in full text and were evaluated and summarized in tables. Results: We identified 131 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. EDCs reviewed herein included pesticides (e.g. p,p’-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), atrazine, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin)), synthetic chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), parabens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contraceptive pills), phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein, resveratrol), and certain mycotoxins (e.g. zearalenone). Most studies assessed environmental EDCs exposure via biomarker measurements. Conclusion: We identified certain EDC exposures could potentially elevate the risk of breast cancer. As majority of EDCs are highly persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative, it is essential to assess the long-term impacts of EDC exposures, especially multi-generational and transgenerational. Also, since food is often a major route of exposure to EDCs, well-designed exposure assessments of potential EDCs in food and food packing are necessary and their potential link to breast cancer development need to be carefully evaluated for subsequent EDC policy making and regulations. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Enantiomeric profiling of chiral environmental contaminants is an actual and imperative issue. Despite having similar physicochemical properties, enantiomers may differ in their interactions with enzymes, receptors and other chiral molecules leading to different biological response. Their differences in bio-degradation, transformation or accumulation should be carefully considered when assessing health risks since they can affect living organisms in a different way. This work reviews the behavior of several groups of environmentally relevant chiral contaminants including pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, perfluoroalkyl substances, brominated flame retardants, pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls and their main metabolites. The enantioselectivity and fate of these compounds in: i) wastewater treatment plants, ii) aquatic and terrestrial environments; and iii) living organisms is discussed. It cannot be predicted whether each specific enantiomer of a chiral compound will be preferably enriched or degraded. The extent of stereoselectivity is associated to several factors, including the specific chiral pollutant, the environmental matrix, the treatment technology used, as well as the season and local environmental factors (pH, soil texture, porosity, organic amended), which are in turn influenced by the activity of the microbial communities. Therefore the environmental fate of enantiomers always needs to be investigated. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

It has been proposed that some cryptogenic strokes (CSs) can be caused by paradoxical embolism across a PFO. PFOs can be treated medically with antithrombotic agents and percutaneously with occluder devices. Large randomized clinical trials have found transcatheter PFO closure to be superior to medical treatment for the prevention of recurrent stroke in young patients with CS. However, the superiority of PFO closure over medical treatment in unselected populations has not been demonstrated. In this chapter, we review the evidence supporting PFO closure and the selection of patients for such intervention. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background/Aim: This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of integrated dual lag screw (IDL) cephalomedullary nails (CMN) when compared with single lag screw (SL) constructs, in the internal fixation of intertrochanteric femoral fractures. Methods: The Smith & Nephew InterTan IDL was compared with SL CMN group consisting of the Stryker Gamma-3 (G3) and Synthes Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA) CMN. A multi-database search was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Data from studies assessing the clinical and radiological outcomes, complications and perioperative parameters of InterTan versus G3 or PFNA CMN in patients with intertrochanteric femoral fractures were extracted and analysed. Results: 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis, consisting of 2643 patients. InterTan was associated with lower complication rates in terms of all-cause revisions (OR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22–0.51; p < 0.001), cut-outs (OR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.17–0.51; p < 0.001), medial or lateral screw migration (OR 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06–0.65; p = 0.008) as well as persistent hip and thigh pain (OR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47–0.90; p = 0.008). In terms of perioperative parameters, InterTan is associated with longer operative times (MD 5.57 minutes; 95% CI, 0.37–10.78 minutes, p = 0.04) and fluoroscopy times (MD 38.89 seconds, 95% CI, 15.88–61.91 seconds; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of clinical Harris Hip Score and radiological outcomes, non-union, haematoma, femoral fractures, varus collapse, length of stay and mean intraoperative blood loss between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Integrated dual lag screw cephalomedullary nails are associated with fewer revisions and complications. However, there is insufficient data to suggest that either nail construct is associated with better functional outcomes. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Nowadays, water scarcity is an identifiable problem facing society. However, as a result of modernization, water consumption is dramatically in increase although the water supply remains constant. Unfortunately every sector consumes water resulting in massive amounts of wastewater that requires treatment prior to their final disposal that still a challenge to the modern societies. Among the various technologies investigated, adsorption considered the most widely applied technology for safe environmental remediation. In this regard, the term of green adsorbents is introduced that is meant the low-cost materials originated from waste, i.e., agriculture waste to be valuable adsorbents. Thus, extensive list of different adsorbents from natural, industrial waste, agriculture bio-products or modified materials have been applied for the elimination of various contaminants from aqueous matrix are compiled here as a demanding area since it has double benefits as an industrial ecology approach. Also, this article discusses the basic principles of adsorption process including the adsorption isotherm and kinetic models. Although numerous review articles are dealing with low-cost adsorption performances, there is insufficient information on the emerging pollutants elimination. The major focus of this work is highlighting the research on the application of the low-cost adsorbents on the emerging pollutants, namely, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, personal care products and perfluorinated compounds. Scattered information on using various adsorbents are provided information in adsorbing emerging pollutants uptake reached to 920 mg/g. The main parameters that affect the adsorption process and the economic prospective is also discussed. Desorption and recycling scenario is concluded and desorption efficiency could reach to 99%. Finally, the future development of further research and few suggestions are also prospected. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Abstract: Formulas of efficient relaxation time are obtained for the cases when the free length of electrons is less or comparable with the characteristic dimensions of metallic regions. The frequency dispersion of optical characteristics of spherical bimetallic particles is calculated near plasma resonance in the absence of quantum-size effects. Retaining the style of common description of metallic particles based on the Mie–Drude theories, the frequency dependence of electric dipole polarizability of a two-layered metallic nanosphere was analyzed. The appearance of two polarizability maxima is the result of a difference in core and shell metals. The calculations are conducted for the following particles immersed into teflon: Au@Ag, Ag@Au, Au@Pt, Pt@Au, and Pt@Pd. It is demonstrated that the optical characteristics of bimetallic particles can be controlled by means of changing their composition and volumetric metal content. Cross-sections of absorption and scattering, as well as optical radiation efficiency of the particles in a wide spectrum range are calculated. Possible temperature of bimetallic particles at the absorption of an electromagnetic wave (for the photothermal therapy of malignant tumors) is estimated. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

The largest surface area (571 m2/g) and pore volume (0.65 cm3/g) were obtained from the N2 physisorption analysis of 1 wt.% Sn-promoted catalyst (E). Cu2O and CuO were identified in the X-ray diffractograms (XRD) of all the catalysts except for catalyst E, which revealed only the peaks of Cu2O owing to the small particle size of CuO below the threshold of detection of XRD. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed the presence of both oxidized and reduced phases of Cu, Fe, Ti, Zr and Sn in their respective catalysts, with the highest and lowest atomic compositions of reduced Fe and CuO, respectively, detected in catalyst E; corroborating findings from XRD analyses. The relatively homogeneous dispersion of phases present in catalyst E (revealed by its smallest crystallite size of 5.1 nm) was also evidenced by the weakest metal-support interaction from the H2-TPR analysis of the same catalyst. Hydroprocessing of oleic acid using catalyst E at 320 °C under H2 pressure of 2.1 MPa and reaction time of 8 h resulted in the highest aviation turbine fuel range hydrocarbons selectivity of 76.8 % and yield of 71.7 %. This was due to its high metal dispersion, desirable textural properties and high oxophilic reduced iron content. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Intertrochanteric fractures, accountable for 50% of hip fractures, can be fixed with cephalomedullary devices such as Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA™), Gamma3 nailing system and TRIGEN™ InterTAN™ nail (IT). IT uniquely uses two cephalocervical screws that allow for linear compression and provide additional resistance to femoral head rotation. A literature review assessing clinical outcomes of these devices was conducted, with 14 studies enrolling 3104 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. PFNA and Gamma3 had better intraoperative outcomes compared with IT; however, IT had superior implant-related outcomes of cut-out and screw migration. No difference was found between IT and PFNA or Gamma3 in Harris Hip Scores, time to union, malunion and nonunion. Further long-term studies are needed to evaluate clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of cephalomedullary devices. Hip fractures remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality within healthcare systems, with an estimated global incidence of 1.6 million fractures annually. Certain intertrochanteric fractures - a specific subtype of hip fractures - are treated surgically using intramedullary nailing devices such as Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA™), Gamma3 nailing system and InterTAN™ nail (IT). IT is unique, in that it uses two proximal screws. This study assessed the clinical and radiological outcomes of using IT over the traditional one-screw devices PFNA and Gamma3. © 2020 Akshay Date.},

abstract={Background: Human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been primarily attributed to contaminated food and drinking water. However, additional PFAS exposure pathways have been raised by a limited number of studies reporting correlations between commercial and industrial products and PFAS levels in human media and biomonitoring. Systematic review (SR) methodologies have been widely used to evaluate similar questions using an unbiased approach in the fields of clinical medicine, epidemiology, and toxicology, but the deployment in exposure science is ongoing. Here we present a systematic review protocol that adapts existing systematic review methodologies and study evaluation tools to exposure science studies in order to investigate evidence for important PFAS exposure pathways from indoor media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, plus indoor air and dust. Objectives: We will systematically review exposure science studies that present both PFAS concentrations from indoor exposure media and PFAS concentrations in blood serum or plasma. Exposure estimates will be synthesized from the evidence to answer the question, “For the general population, what effect does exposure from PFAS chemicals via indoor media have on blood, serum or plasma concentrations of PFAS?” We adapt existing systematic review methodologies and study evaluation tools from the U.S. EPA's Systematic Review Protocol for the PFBA, PFHxA, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDA IRIS Assessments and the Navigation Guide for exposure science studies, as well as present innovative developments of exposure pathway-specific search strings for use in artificial intelligence screening software. Data Sources: We will search electronic databases for potentially relevant literature, including Web of Science, PubMed, and ProQuest. Literature search results will be stored in EPA's Health and Environmental Research Online (HERO) database. Study eligibility and criteria: Included studies will present exposure measures from indoor media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, plus indoor air and dust, paired with PFAS concentrations in blood, serum or plasma from adults and/or children in the general population. We focus on a subset of PFAS chemicals including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Studies will be prefiltered at the title and abstract level using computationally intelligent search strings to expedite the screening process for reviewers. Two independent reviewers will screen the prefiltered studies against inclusion criteria at the title/abstract level and then full-text level, after which the reviewers will assess the studies’ risk of bias using an approach modified from established systematic review tools for exposure studies. Exposure estimates will be calculated to investigate the proportion of blood, serum or plasma) PFAS concentrations that can be explained by exposure to PFAS in indoor media. © 2020},

abstract={Background: Posterior fossa abnormalities (PFAs) are commonly identified within routine screening and are a frequent indication for fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although biometric measurements of the posterior fossa (PF) are established on fetal ultrasound and MRI, qualitative visual assessments are predominantly used to differentiate PFAs. Objectives: This systematic review aimed to assess 2-dimensional (2D) biometric measurements currently in use for assessing the PF on fetal MRI to delineate different PFAs. Methods: The protocol was registered (PROSPERO ID CRD42019142162). Eligible studies included T2-weighted MRI PF measurements in fetuses with and without PFAs, including measurements of the PF, or other brain areas relevant to PFAs. Results: 59 studies were included – 6859 fetuses had 62 2D PF and related measurements. These included linear, area and angular measurements, representing measures of PF size, cerebellum/vermis, brainstem, and supratentorial measurements. 11 measurements were used in 10 or more studies and at least 1200 fetuses. These dimensions were used to characterise normal for gestational age, diagnose a range of pathologies, and predict outcome. Conclusion: A selection of validated 2D biometric measurements of the PF on fetal MRI may be useful for identification of PFA in different clinical settings. Consistent use of these measures, both clinically and for research, is recommended. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Although the COVID-19 virus mechanisms of action and pathogenesis are still under extensive research, immune system effects are evident, leading, in many cases, to respiratory distress. Although apparent pollution reduction has been noticed by the population, environmental and human health impacts due to the increased use of plastic waste and disinfectants is concerning. One of the main routes of human exposure to pollutants is through drinking water. Thus, this point of view discusses some major contaminants in drinking water known to be immunotoxic, exploring sources and drinking water routes and emphasizing the known mechanisms of action that could likely compromise the effective immune response of humans, particularly raising concerns regarding people exposed to the COVID-19 virus. Based on a literature review, metals, plastic components, plasticizers, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances may display the potential to exacerbate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms, although epidemiological studies are still required to confirm the synergistic effects between these pollutants and the virus. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Persistent halogenated organic pollutants (HOPs) are a class of toxic chemicals, which may have adverse effects on fetuses via transplacental transfer from their mothers. Here, we review reported internal exposure levels of various HOPs (organochlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, short- and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) in placenta, and both maternal and umbilical cord sera. We also present analyses of the transplacental transfer and placental distribution characteristics of each class of compounds, and discuss effects of several factors on the transfer and accumulation efficiencies of HOPs, as well as the main mechanisms of HOPs’ transfer across the placental barrier. Reported compound-specific transplacental transfer efficiencies and distribution efficiencies, expressed as umbilical cord:maternal serum and placental:maternal serum concentration ratios (RCM and RPM, respectively), are summarized. Average published RCM values of the HOPs range from 0.24 to 3.08 (lipid-adjusted) and from 0.04 to 3.1 (based on wet weights), and are highest for perfluoroalkylcarboxylates (PFCAs) and tetrabromobisphenol A. Average published RPM values range from 0.14 to 1.02 (lipid-adjusted) and from 0.30 to 1.4 (based on wet weights). The broad RCM and RPM ranges may reflect effects of various factors, inter alia physicochemical properties of HOPs, metabolic capacities of mothers and fetuses, placental maturity, and differential expression of influx/efflux transporters in the placenta. Generally, HOPs’ RCM values decline linearly with molecular size, and are curvilinearly related to solubility. Plasma protein binding affinity and the difference between maternal and fetal metabolic capacities may also affect some HOPs’ transfer efficiencies. HOPs’ molecular size may be influential. Transplacental transport of HOPs likely occurs mostly through passive diffusion, although influx/efflux transporters expressed on maternal and/or fetal sides of the placenta may also facilitate or hinder their transport. Overall, the review highlights clear gaps in our understanding of mechanisms involved in HOPs’ transplacental transport. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Organic ultraviolet filters (OUVFs) are used in a wide range of manufactured products including personal care (e.g. sunscreens) and plastic items. This review summarizes the available data regarding the toxic effects of OUVFs on marine and freshwater organisms and generates the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) values necessary for assessing ecological risk. Through a systematic search of the literature, 89 studies were identified and ecotoxicological data extracted. Collectively, these studies described toxicity testing with 39 OUVF from 10 structural classes, with derivatives of benzophenones (49%) and camphors (16%) most studied. There was a bias towards selecting freshwater species (61%), and evaluating single OUVF effects (87%) rather than OUVF mixtures. Short-term (acute) experimentation (58%) was marginally more common than long-term (chronic) testing (42%). Reproductive, developmental, genetic, and neurological toxicity were the most commonly identified effects in aquatic organism, and were associated with molecular interactions with steroid receptors, DNA, or the production of reactive oxygen species. Species sensitivity distribution and/or assessment factors were used to calculate PNECs for 22 OUVFs and the risk quotients for 12 OUVFs. When using maximum concentrations, high risk was observed for six OUVFs in marine environments (4-methylbenzylidene-camphor, octocrylene, padimate-O, benzophenone-1, and oxybenzone, ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate), and for four OUVFs in freshwater environments (ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, avobenzone and oxybenzone). When using median concentrations, a risk to marine environments was observed for oxybenzone. The results of this review underline that there is limited knowledge of the pathological effects of OUVFs and their metabolites in aquatic environments, and this inhibits the development of informed water-quality guidelines. © 2020 Elsevier LtdOUVF research has focused on effects in freshwater more than marine organisms, yet evidence indicates OUVFs pose a risk to both; but current knowledge gaps inhibit the development of informed water-quality guidelines. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Objective: To investigate whether proteomic biomarkers may aid prediction of transition to psychotic disorder in the clinical high-risk (CHR) state and adolescent psychotic experiences (PEs) in the general population. Design, Setting, and Participants: This diagnostic study comprised 2 case-control studies nested within the European Network of National Schizophrenia Networks Studying Gene-Environment Interactions (EU-GEI) and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). EU-GEI is an international multisite prospective study of participants at CHR referred from local mental health services. ALSPAC is a United Kingdom-based general population birth cohort. Included were EU-GEI participants who met CHR criteria at baseline and ALSPAC participants who did not report PEs at age 12 years. Data were analyzed from September 2018 to April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: In EU-GEI, transition status was assessed by the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States or contact with clinical services. In ALSPAC, PEs at age 18 years were assessed using the Psychosis-Like Symptoms Interview. Proteomic data were obtained from mass spectrometry of baseline plasma samples in EU-GEI and plasma samples at age 12 years in ALSPAC. Support vector machine learning algorithms were used to develop predictive models. Results: The EU-GEI subsample (133 participants at CHR (mean [SD] age, 22.6 [4.5] years; 68 [51.1%] male) comprised 49 (36.8%) who developed psychosis and 84 (63.2%) who did not. A model based on baseline clinical and proteomic data demonstrated excellent performance for prediction of transition outcome (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.95; positive predictive value [PPV], 75.0%; and negative predictive value [NPV], 98.6%). Functional analysis of differentially expressed proteins implicated the complement and coagulation cascade. A model based on the 10 most predictive proteins accurately predicted transition status in training (AUC, 0.99; PPV, 76.9%; and NPV, 100%) and test (AUC, 0.92; PPV, 81.8%; and NPV, 96.8%) data. The ALSPAC subsample (121 participants from the general population with plasma samples available at age 12 years (61 [50.4%] male) comprised 55 participants (45.5%) with PEs at age 18 years and 61 (50.4%) without PEs at age 18 years. A model using proteomic data at age 12 years predicted PEs at age 18 years, with an AUC of 0.74 (PPV, 67.8%; and NPV, 75.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: In individuals at risk of psychosis, proteomic biomarkers may contribute to individualized prognosis and stratification strategies. These findings implicate early dysregulation of the complement and coagulation cascade in the development of psychosis outcomes. © 2021 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

METHODS: A computer was used to search databases such as Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Sinomed, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP to collect and compare the literatures of Inter-TAN, PFNA, and PFNA-II in the treatment of elderly unstable intertrochanteric fractures. The search period was from the establishment of the database to December 2019. Two reviewers independently read the screening literature, extracted data and evaluated the quality. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.3 software. RESULTS: (1) A total of eight studies were included, with 1 349 patients, including two randomized controlled studies and six cohort studies. The evidence level was ≥ III. (2) Meta-analysis showed that the operation time and intraoperative fluoroscopy time were longer, and intraoperative blood loss was more in the Inter-TAN group than those of the PFNA-II group [MD=-16.60, 95%CI (-23.22,-9.99), P <0.05; MD=-1.85, 95%CI (-2.53,-1.16), P <0.05; MD=-9.83, 95%CI (-12.66,-6.99), P <0.000 01], with no significant difference compared with PFNA group (P >0.05). There was no significant difference in tip-apex distance, length of hospital stay, and Harris score of Inter-TAN group compared with PFNA group and PFNA-II group (P > 0.05). The incidence of postoperative screw cut-out in the Inter-TAN group was less than in the PFNA group and the PFNA-II group [OR=6.47, 95%CI(2.79, 15.00), P < 0.05; OR=5.88, 95%CI(1.29, 26.69), P <0.05]. The incidence of hip or thigh pain in the Inter-TAN group was less than that in the PFNA group and the PFNA-II group [OR=2.57, 95%CI(1.19, 5.52), P < 0.05; OR=3.20, 95%CI(-1.56, 6.55), P <0.05]. Postoperative femoral shaft fractures in the Inter-TAN group were less than those in the PFNA group and PFNA-II group [OR=3.87, 95%CI(1.75, 8.57), P <0.05; OR=7.06, 95%CI(1.24, 40.07), P <0.05]. The incidence of postoperative secondary surgery in the Inter-TAN group was less than in the PFNA group [OR=4.10, 95%CI(2.45, 6.86), P <0.05], and there was no significant difference compared with PFNA-II group (P >0.05). CONCLUSION: For patients with osteoporosis and poor stability, Inter-TAN can provide better stability and reduce postoperative complications. For patients with poor general conditions and greater surgical risk, PFNA-II internal fixation can be selected. © 2021, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are man-made persistent organic compounds of significant health and environmental concern because of their resistance to degradation, tendency for global transport, and ability to bioaccumulate. The widespread use and stability of PFASs provide many opportunities for human exposure to these contaminants. In recent years, our understanding of PFASs as contaminants in vegetation has increased considerably. PFASs are taken up, transformed and accumulated in various compartments of plants, and the rate of these processes depends on environmental conditions, compound-specific characteristics, plant species, and other competing factors. This review summarizes the recent findings on the uptake, accumulation, distribution and metabolism of PFASs in higher plants, with a specific focus on plant metabolism pathways of representative polyfluoroalkyl compounds. The potential risk of PFASs in plant-origin food for human exposure is also discussed. Further studies on plant metabolism of polyfluoroalkyl chemicals are in urgent need to fill the data gaps and allow a comprehensive understanding of plant metabolism pathways. Additional research questions are proposed, including the behavior and fate of new PFASs and PFOS/PFOA replacements in environmental systems in the presence of plants, and the phytoremediation potential of different plant species. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This paper reviews the technological and economical feasibilities as well as sustainable assessment of approaches (thermochemical and biochemical) applied for sustainable “drop-in” fuel production from lignocellulosic sources. The challenges for each pathway to produce “drop-in” fuels are covered. Currently “drop-in” fuel production cost is approximately 2 times (~5–6$/gallon) higher than fossil fuels (3$/gallon), especially with the use of 2nd generation feedstocks. The primary sources of cost with “drop-in” fuel production are feedstock cost (40–60% of the total production cost), syngas cleaning and conditioning to meet Fischer-Tropsch synthesis requirement (12–15% of the total production cost) and bio oil upgrading (14–18% of the total production cost) in the case of pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The most influential factors on the life cycle analysis (LCA) were biomass cultivation, harvesting, biomass pre-treatment, and transportation. Therefore, robust processes that can use local waste biomass are far more environmental and economically viable, especially as biofuel from second generation have a greater potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (50–100%) than first generation biofuels (50–90%) when land use changes are omitted in the LCA. The sustainability of biofuels is pre-dominantly dependant on the sustainability of the initial biomass, with 2nd generation feedstocks being more sustainable than 1st generation. Gasification-FTS is considered as the most promising technique for “drop-in” fuel production over pyrolysis and HTL due to its flexibility towards feedstock acceptance and the ability to produced high yields of liquid fuel together with other economically viable biofuels such as electricity and heat. Biochemical routes (i.e.fermentation) to “drop-in” fuels are still in their early development stages, and therefore require more studies and pilot-scale experiments in order to discover an economic and sustainable means of using these methods. © 2020},

abstract={Perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) have attracted massive attention in recent years for their endocrine-disrupting potential. This review summarizes the underlying evidence on the primary fate and in vitro/vivo toxic effects of PFCs and their interactions and relationships with thyroid dysfunction and cancer induction in exposed groups, including the general population, occupationally exposed groups, highly exposed individuals, and prone subjects (pregnant women and neonates). The potential endocrine-disrupting mechanism of PFCs may include multiple processes of thyroid malfunction or hormonal imbalance. The increased level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was observed as the most consistent outcome of PFC exposure among generally exposed populations. Specifically, the levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and TSH were significantly correlated among pregnant women. In some instances, the maternal PFC level was negatively correlated with the neonatal thyroxine (T4) level in serum. The PFCs and thyroid malfunction or thyroid hormone (TH) levels also revealed a potential association among the population under high-level environmental exposure, albeit not always following a strict exposure-response relationship. Moreover, occupational exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) showed a probable link with TH (excluding TSH) alterations in serum. Importantly, no concrete and statistically significant evidence highlighted the risk of thyroid cancer in humans exposed to PFCs. Highlights The first robust review describing the effects of PFCs on thyroid dysfunctions. PFC exposure induces sex- and age-specific responses in the human thyroid system. Serum PFOS exposure is positively correlated with TSH in pregnant women. Maternal serum PFC levels are negatively correlated with the neonate’s T4 levels. No statistical evidence supported a concrete association between PFCs and thyroid cancer. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Organohalides are organic molecules formed biotically and abiotically, both naturally and through industrial production. They are usually toxic and represent a health risk for living organisms, including humans. Bacteria capable of degrading organohalides for growth express dehalogenase genes encoding enzymes that cleave carbon-halogen bonds. Such bacteria are of potential high interest for bioremediation of contaminated sites. Dehalogenase genes are often part of gene clusters that may include regulators, accessory genes and genes for transporters and other enzymes of organohalide degradation pathways. Organohalides and their degradation products affect the activity of regulatory factors, and extensive genome-wide modulation of gene expression helps dehalogenating bacteria to cope with stresses associated with dehalogenation, such as intracellular increase of halides, dehalogenase-dependent acid production, organohalide toxicity and misrouting and bottlenecks in metabolic fluxes. This review focuses on transcriptional regulation of gene clusters for dehalogenation in bacteria, as studied in laboratory experiments and in situ. The diversity in gene content, organization and regulation of such gene clusters is highlighted for representative organohalide-degrading bacteria. Selected examples illustrate a key, overlooked role of regulatory processes, often strain-specific, for efficient dehalogenation and productive growth in presence of organohalides. © FEMS 2020.

The method compares the Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) of the case studies with and without debonding damage. This analysis is done mainly through metrics of damage detection based on a comparison between the magnitude and phase angles of FRFs. The same metrics were also used after the application of a data filtering process. The specimens were manufactured from carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers and titanium and were joined by epoxy resin. Half of the specimens have a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) attached to the titanium adherent. The debonding damage was simulated for the damaged specimens by having 50% of the overlap area covered by a layer of Teflon. Three case studies have been reported: first, it verifies the influence of the PZT on FRFs; second, it evaluates the influence of the debonding damage by using accelerometers, and third, it performs the damage detection analysis by using the electrical responses of the PZT. Numerical and experimental analyses are compared, evaluating limitations and potentialities of the computational models. The results support the applicability of the metrics for damage quantification. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are contaminants of great concern due to their wide-spread occurrence and persistence in the environments (i.e., in water, soil and sediment) and potential toxicology even at very low concentration. The main focus of this review is on the PFASs in soil and sediments. More specifically, this review systematically examines the occurrence and toxicological effects with associated risks, fate (i.e., PFASs adsorption by soil and sediment, transportation and transformation, and bioaccumulation), and remediation practices of PFASs in soil and sediment. Various models and equations such as fugacity-based multimedia fate and hydrodynamic models are used to study the fate, transport, and transformation of PFASs. Among different remediation practices, sorption is the dominant process for the removal of PFASs from soil and sediments. Results also indicate that PFASs adsorption onto activated carbon decrease with the increase of carbon chain length in the PFASs. The longer-chain PFASs have larger partition coefficient values than shorter-chained PFASs. Sorption of PFASs to soil and sediments are mainly governed by different electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds formation, hydrophobic interactions, organic content in soil and sediments, and ligand exchange. Other technology such as thermal treatment might be potential in the removal of PAFSs, but need further study to elucidate a conclusion. Finally, the associated challenges and future outlook have been included. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The growing interest in nanomaterials with advanced optoelectronic properties has promoted the advancement of biosensors with various applications. In the environmental field, the need for rapid detection of pollutants in water sources has opened the door to fluorescent biosensors. These systems are quite sensitive and simple. Nanomaterials such as carbon dots (CD), quantum dots (QD), gold nanoparticles, nanoclusters, graphene (G), graphene oxide (GO), transition metal dialcogens (TMDC) and organometallic frameworks (MOF), have been used in the development of fluorescent detection systems. They are usually based on the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) quenching principle. Nanomaterials can be bioconjugated with molecules such as antibodies, enzymes or aptamers, to achieve specific detection of the target pollutant, even in real samples. This review conducts a critical analysis of the operating principle of different nanomaterial-based fluorescent biosensors. We discuss the detection of substances of high concern like heavy metals, pesticides, and so-called emerging contaminants. The advantages and disadvantages of the methods are discussed, as well as recommendations for future approaches and a possible massification of these systems. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Humans are constantly being exposed to various xenobiotics at relatively low concentrations. To date, limited evidence is available to ascertain whether a complex xenobiotic mixture at human-relevant levels causes any health effect. Moreover, there is no effective method to pinpoint the contribution of each chemical toward such an effect. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to understand the responses of cells to a mixture containing 23 xenobiotics at human-relevant levels and develop a fea-sible method to decipher the chemical(s) that contribute significantly to the observed effect. METHODS: We characterized the metabolome and transcriptome of breast cancer cells (MCF-7) before and after exposure to the mixture at human-relevant levels; preexposure levels were derived from existing large-scale biomonitoring data. A high-throughput metabolomics-based “leave-one-out” method was proposed to understand the relative contribution of each component by comparing the metabolome with and without the particular chemical in the mixture. RESULTS: The metabolomic analysis suggested that the mixture altered metabolites associated with cell proliferation and oxidative stress. For the tran-scriptomes, gene ontology terms and pathways including “cell cycle,” “cell proliferation,” and “cell division” were significantly altered after mixture exposure. The mixture altered genes associated with pathways such as “genotoxicity” and “nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2).” Through joint pathways analysis, metabolites and genes were observed to be well-aligned in pyrimidine and purine metabolisms. The leave-one-out results showed that many chemicals made their contributions to specific metabolic pathways. The overall metabolome pattern of the absence of 2,4-dihyroxybenzophenone (DHB) or bisphenol A (BPA) showed great resemblance to controls, suggesting their higher relative contribution to the observed effect. DISCUSSION: The omics results showed that exposure to the mixture at human-relevant levels can induce significant in vitro cellular changes. Also, the leave one out method offers an effective approach for deconvoluting the effects of the mixture. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The growing concerns on the sustainability of our planet have been leading the way to the development of alternative and renewable forms of energy. One example is the use of waste (e.g. sewage sludge, forest residues, agroindustry and food processing) to produce biogas. Comprised mostly of methane and carbon dioxide, it can be used as fuel in cogeneration systems, automotive mobility and domestic heating, among other applications. The increasing interest in the use of biogas has raised some questions regarding its quality for energy valorization. To start, the carbon dioxide content must be adjusted to upgrade the calorific power and economic value and then common potentially hazardous and even toxic impurities such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfur, halogens, or ammonia should be removed to ensure a correct operation. Recently, a close attention was drawn to the presence of siloxanes. These widespread emerging pollutants compromise the use of biogas for energy production due to the formation of abrasive silicon oxides after combustion that deposit on and damage several engine parts. In addition, some of them are potentially toxic and persistent, involving a threat to humans and the environment, which increased drastically the literature devoted to them in the last years. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of the literature available on biogas impurities, presenting their main effects, sampling and analytical strategies, and concentrations. A summary of removal methodologies is also presented to address the technological challenges to cope with these unwanted compounds. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Antibiotic resistance (AR) remains a major threat to public and animal health globally. However, AR ramifications in developing countries are worsened by limited molecular diagnostics, expensive therapeutics, inadequate numbers of skilled clinicians and scientists, and unsanitary environments. The epidemiology of Gram-negative bacteria, their AR genes, and geographical distribution in Africa are described here. Data were extracted and analyzed from English-language articles published between 2015 and December 2019. The genomes and AR genes of the various species, obtained from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) and NCBI were analyzed phylogenetically using Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood (RAxML) and annotated with Figtree. The geographic location of resistant clones/clades was mapped manually. Thirty species from 31 countries and 24 genera from 41 countries were analyzed from 146 articles and 3,028 genomes, respectively. Genes mediating resistance to β-lactams (including blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M, blaNDM, blaIMP, blaVIM, and blaOXA-48/181), fluoroquinolones (oqxAB, qnrA/B/ D/S, gyrA/B, and parCE mutations, etc.), aminoglycosides (including armA and rmtC/ F), sulfonamides (sul1/2/3), trimethoprim (dfrA), tetracycline [tet(A/B/C/D/G/O/M/39)], colistin (mcr-1), phenicols (catA/B, cmlA), and fosfomycin (fosA) were mostly found in Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and also in Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter baumannii, etc., on mostly IncF-type, IncX3/4, ColRNAI, and IncR plasmids, within IntI1 gene cassettes, insertion sequences, and transposons. Clonal and multiclonal outbreaks and dissemination of resistance genes across species and countries and between humans, animals, plants, and the environment were observed; Escherichia coli ST103, K. pneumoniae ST101, S. enterica ST1/2, and Vibrio cholerae ST69/515 were common strains. Most pathogens were of human origin, and zoonotic transmissions were relatively limited. IMPORTANCE Antibiotic resistance (AR) is one of the major public health threats and challenges to effective containment and treatment of infectious bacterial diseases worldwide. Here, we used different methods to map out the geographical hot spots, sources, and evolutionary epidemiology of AR. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., Neisseria meningitis/gonorrhoeae, Vibrio cholerae, Campylobacter jejuni, etc., were common pathogens shuttling AR genes in Africa. Transmission of the same clones/strains across countries and between animals, humans, plants, and the environment was observed. We recommend Enterobacter spp. or K. pneumoniae as better sentinel species for AR surveillance. Copyright © 2020 Osei Sekyere and Reta.

The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to determine whether PFOA affects functional outcomes and survivorship after medial UKA. Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library and Web of science to identify studies published in English (the last search was updated on June 1, 2020). The primary outcome measure was the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), whereas the secondary outcomes included range of motion (ROM) and the revision rate. Patients with patellofemoral joint narrowing or cartilage lesions as assessed intraoperatively or by radiography were assigned to the PFOA group. Results: A total of 8 studies involving 3504 patients and 3975 knees were included in this meta-analysis. No patients had a severe lateral patellar groove. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the OKS, revision rate and ROM between PFOA patients and patients without PFOA. Conclusions: No significant difference in functional outcomes and survivorship was found between patients with and without PFOA. Patients with PFOA assessed by radiographs or intraoperatively but without a lateral patellar groove should be considered candidates for medial UKA. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common causes of cancer in the world and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Mortality is associated mainly with the development of metastases. Identification of the mechanisms involved in metastasis formation is, therefore, a major public health issue. Among the proposed risk factors, chemical environment and pollution are increasingly suggested to have an effect on the signaling pathways involved in metastatic tumor cells emergence and progression. The purpose of this article is to summarize current knowledge about the role of environmental chemicals in breast cancer progression, metastasis formation and resistance to chemotherapy. Through a scoping review, we highlight the effects of a wide variety of environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants and endocrine disruptors, on invasion mechanisms and metastatic processes in BC. We identified the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer-stemness (the stem cell-like phenotype in tumors), two mechanisms suspected of playing key roles in the development of metastases and linked to chemoresistance, as potential targets of contaminants. We discuss then the recently described pro-migratory and pro-invasive Ah receptor signaling pathway and conclude that his role in BC progression is still controversial. In conclusion, although several pertinent pathways for the effects of xenobiotics have been identified, the mechanisms of actions for multiple other molecules remain to be established. The integral role of xenobiotics in the exposome in BC needs to be further explored through additional relevant epidemiological studies that can be extended to molecular mechanisms. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Methods: According to the Cochrane systemic analysis method, randomized control trials (RCTs) and retrospective comparative observational studies which were related to the comparison of PFNA and InterTAN nail in the treatment of the elderly with intertrochanteric fractures were retrieved. Data were independently extracted from the included studies by two reviewers and analyzed using RevMan 5.3, and the quality of the studies was assessed. Results: Two RCTs and seven observational studies were recruited, which consisted of 681 patients with PFNA and 651 patients with InterTAN nail. The meta-analyses showed no significant differences between the two approaches on Harris Hip Score, operation time, blood loss, time to union, mean hospital stay, union problems, intraoperative complications, hematoma, infection, and other complications in both RCTs and observational studies. In terms of other outcomes, for the RCTs, results showed that there were shorter tip–apex distance and reduced pain at thigh or hip in InterTAN nail than in PFNA; however, InterTAN nail was not superior to PFNA in cutout, reoperation, and femoral shaft fracture; for observational studies, the risk of the screw migration (RR = 5.13, 95%CI [1.33,19.75], P = 0.02), cutout (RR = 3.26, 95%CI [1.64,6.47], P = 0.0008), the varus collapse of the femoral head (RR = 7.19, 95%CI [2.18,23.76], P = 0.001), femoral shaft fracture (RR = 5.73, 95%CI [2.24,14.65], P = 0.0003) treated by InterTAN nail were significantly decreased, compared with those by PFNA; however, no significant differences were observed in the aspects of tip–apex distance and pain at thigh or hip between these two groups.

abstract={Environmental pollution by antibiotics has severely affected human health and development. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have also been recognized as emerging pollutants because of their persistence and adverse impacts in aquatic ecosystems, even at low concentrations. For the alleviation and elimination of antibiotics stress, several approaches have been proposed, some of which have been applied in practice. This review systematically summarizes the removal strategies for various antibiotics and their corresponding mechanisms, including chemical, physical, biological, condition-based and combined strategies. Moreover, a comparison among these methods is made with a focus on the performance and efficiency. Further research needs are also proposed, which provides a guidance for the establishment of a control strategy to achieve simultaneous removal of nitrogen, antibiotics and ARGs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: The C8 Science Panel was composed of three epidemiologists charged with studying the possible health effects of PFOA in a highly exposed population in the mid-Ohio Valley. The Panel determined in 2012 there was a ‘probable link’ (i.e., more probable than not based on the weight of the available scientific evidence) between PFOA and high cholesterol, thyroid disease, kidney and testicular cancer, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. Objective: Here, former C8 Science Panel members and collaborators comment on the PFOA literature regarding thyroid disorders, cancer, immune and auto-immune disorders, liver disease, hypercholesterolemia, reproductive outcomes, neurotoxicity, and kidney disease. We also discuss developments regarding fate and transport, and pharmacokinetic models, and discuss causality assessment in cross-sectional associations among low-exposed populations. Discussion: For cancer, the epidemiologic evidence remains supportive but not definitive for kidney and testicular cancers. There is consistent evidence of a positive association between PFOA and cholesterol, but no evidence of an association with heart disease. There is evidence for an association with ulcerative colitis, but not for other auto-immune diseases. There is good evidence that PFOA is associated with immune response, but uneven evidence for an association with infectious disease. The evidence for an association between PFOA and thyroid and kidney disease is suggestive but uneven. There is evidence of an association with liver enzymes, but not with liver disease. There is little evidence of an association with neurotoxicity. Suggested reductions in birthweight may be due to reverse causality and/or confounding. Fate and transport models and pharmacokinetic models remain central to estimating past exposure for new cohorts, but are difficult to develop without good historical data on emissions of PFOA into the environment. Conclusion: Overall, the epidemiologic evidence remains limited. For a few outcomes there has been some replication of our earlier findings. More longitudinal research is needed in large populations with large exposure contrasts. Additional cross-sectional studies of low exposed populations may be less informative. © 2020},

abstract={Background: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent organic pollutants and widespread throughout the environment. Although exposure to PFASs may contribute to the development of allergic diseases in children, evidence about this association remains inconclusive. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between PFASs exposure and allergic diseases in children based on current evidence. Methods: The databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched to identify all observational studies that examined the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of childhood allergic diseases. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of case-crossover studies, and a previously validated quality assessment framework was used for observational studies lacking control groups. Random-effects meta-analysis models were applied to pool odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: From an initial 94 articles (after duplicate removal), 13 studies through full-text assessment were included for quantitative assessment and descriptive synthesis. They are ten cohort studies, two cross-sectional studies, and one case-control study. The pooled estimates showed that perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was associated with eczema (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.80–0.99), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) with atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.01–1.58), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) with allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.13–1.56). However, no such significant associations were found for wheeze and asthma. Conclusions: The meta-analysis results suggest that PFASs exposure could potentially be associated with eczema, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis during childhood, but not with childhood asthma or wheeze. Future studies are needed to verify these findings. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exposure is ubiquitous among the US population and has been linked to adverse health outcomes including cardiometabolic diseases, immune dysregulation and endocrine disruption. However, the metabolic mechanism underlying the adverse health effect of PFASs exposure is unknown. Objective: The aim of this project is to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and altered metabolic pathways linked to increased cardiometabolic risk in young adults. Methods: A total of 102 young adults with 82% overweight or obese participants were enrolled from Southern California between 2014 and 2017. Cardiometabolic outcomes were assessed including oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measures, body fat and lipid profiles. High-resolution metabolomics was used to quantify plasma exposure levels of three PFAS congeners and intensity profiles of the untargeted metabolome. Fasting concentrations of 45 targeted metabolites involved in fatty acid and lipid metabolism were used to verify untargeted metabolomics findings. Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) was used to examine the associations between PFAS exposure mixture and cardiometabolic outcomes adjusting for covariates. Mummichog pathway enrichment analysis was used to explore PFAS-associated metabolic pathways. Moreover, the effect of PFAS exposure on the metabolic network, including metabolomic profiles and cardiometabolic outcomes, was investigated. Results: Higher exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was associated with higher 30-minute glucose levels and glucose area under the curve (AUC) during the OGTT (p < 0.001). PFAS exposure was also associated with altered lipid pathways, which contributed to the metabolic network connecting PFOA and higher glucose levels following the OGTT. Targeted metabolomics analysis indicated that higher PFOA exposure was associated with higher levels of glycerol (p = 0.006), which itself was associated with higher 30-minute glucose (p = 0.006). Conclusions: Increased lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation could contribute to the biological mechanisms linking PFAS exposure and impaired glucose metabolism among young adults. Findings of this study warrants future experimental studies and epidemiological studies with larger sample size to replicate. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a class of persistent organic contaminants that are ubiquitous in the environment and have been found to be accumulated in agricultural products. Consumption of PFAS-contaminated agricultural products represents a feasible pathway for the trophic transfer of these toxic chemicals along food chains/webs, leading to risks associated with human and animal health. Recently, studies on plant uptake and accumulation of PFASs have rapidly increased; consequently, a review to summarize the current knowledge and highlight future research is needed. Analysis of the publications indicates that a large variety of plant species can take up PFASs from the environment. Vegetables and grains are the most commonly investigated crops, with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) as the most studied PFASs. The potential sources of PFASs for plant uptake include industrial emissions, irrigation with contaminated water, land application of biosolids, leachates from landfill sites, and pesticide application. Root uptake is the predominant pathway for the accumulation of PFASs in agricultural crops, and uptake by plant aboveground portions from the ambient atmosphere could play a minor role in the overall PFAS accumulation. PFAS uptake by plants is influenced by physicochemical properties of compounds (e.g., perfluorocarbon chain length, head group functionality, water solubility, and volatility), plant physiology (e.g., transpiration rate, lipid and protein content), and abiotic factors (e.g., soil organic matters, pH, salinity, and temperature). Based on literature analysis, the current knowledge gaps are identified, and future research prospects are suggested. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Patellofemoral pain (PFP) and patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) are common, persistent conditions that may lie along a pathological spectrum. While evidence supports exercise-therapy as a core treatment for PFP and PFOA, primary care physicians commonly prescribe medication, or refer for surgical consults in persistent cases. We conducted a systematic review of medical interventions (pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and surgical) for PFP and PFOA to inform primary care decision making. Methods: Following protocol registration, we searched seven databases for randomized clinical trials of our target interventions for PFP and PFOA. Our primary outcome was pain. We assessed risk of bias, calculated standardized mean differences (SMDs) and determined the level of evidence for each intervention. Results: We included 14 publications investigating pharmaceutical or nutraceutical interventions, and eight publications investigating surgical interventions. Two randomized control trials (RCTs) provided moderate evidence of patellofemoral arthroplasty having similar pain outcomes compared to total knee arthroplasty in isolated PFOA, with SMDs ranging from -0.3 (95% CI -0.8, 0.2, Western Ontario McMaster Pain Subscale, 1 year post-surgery) to 0.3 (-0.1, 0.7, SF-36 Bodily Pain, 2 years post-surgery). Remaining studies provided, at most, limited evidence. No efficacy was demonstrated for oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories or arthroscopic surgery. Conclusions: Pharmaceutical and nutraceutical prescriptions, and surgical referrals are currently being made with little supporting evidence, with some interventions showing limited efficacy. This should be considered within the broader context of evidence supporting exercise-therapy as a core treatment for PFP and PFOA. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Water-borne emerging pollutants are among the greatest concern of our modern society. Many of these pollutants are categorized as endocrine disruptors due to their environmental toxicities. They are harmful to humans, aquatic animals, and plants, to the larger extent, destroying the ecosystem. Thus, effective environmental remediations of these pollutants became necessary. Among the various remediation techniques, adsorption and photocatalytic degradation have been single out as the most promising. This review is devoted to the compilations and analysis of the role of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their composites as potential materials for such applications. Emerging organic pollutants, like dyes, herbicides, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and perfluorinated alkyl substances, have been extensively studied. Important parameters that affect these processes, such as surface area, bandgap, percentage removal, equilibrium time, adsorption capacity, and recyclability, are documented. Finally, we paint the current scenario and challenges that need to be addressed for MOFs and their composites to be exploited for commercial applications. © 2020 by the authors.

Elasmobranchs are particularly vulnerable to pollutant exposure which may pose a risk to the organism as well as humans that consume elasmobranch products. The highest concentrations of pollutants were found in sharks occupying top trophic levels (Carcharhiniformes and Lamniformes). A human health risk assessment identified that children and adults consuming shark once a week are exposed to over three times more mercury than is recommended by the US EPA. This poses a risk to local fishing communities and international consumers of shark-based products, as well as those subject to the widespread mislabelling of elasmobranch products. Wider screening studies are recommended to determine the risk to elasmobranchs from emerging pollutants and more robust studies are recommended to assess the risks to human health. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The occurrence of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) is related both to drinking water treatment (DWT) processes and to raw water's characteristics. Emerging pollutants typically occur in low concentrations and are not removed by conventional DWT processes. Emerging DBPs appear within the DWT or in the distribution system due to the combination of disinfection agents (especially chlorine) with precursors as: natural organic matter (NOM), algal organic matter (AOM), anthropogenic contaminants (pesticides, pharmaceuticals, detergents etc.), brominated and iodinated compounds. This study has as main goal a consistent analysis of the major problems caused by emerging DBPs to drinking water supplies. It presents a comprehensive review of the research efforts related to emerging DBPs considering three viewpoints: 1. an overview of their classification, legislative framework, methods of analysis, disinfection operational conditions and removal processes; 2. their occurrence, fate, health effects and impacts; 3. the analysis of the advanced DWT processes that might be used for the removal and control of precursors and DBPs, with a focus on pilot and full-scale installations. All presented case studies considered pollutants removed, process conditions and efficiencies, and a critical assessment of processes based on membranes, advanced oxidation and adsorption on activated carbon or other materials. The main challenges of the control and removal of emerging DBPs are their low concentrations and the technical and economic sustainability of their application at full-scale, which need to be carefully adapted to local boundary conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Transition-metal-catalyzed carbonylation is one of the most straightforward strategies to prepare carbonyl compounds. However, compared to well-established noble-metal-catalyzed carbonylation reactions, analogue coupling via base-metal, nickel catalysis has received less attention because of the easy formation of highly toxic and unreactive Ni(CO)4 species between Ni(0) and CO. To date, the use of inexpensive and widely available carbon monoxide (CO) gas for nickel-catalyzed carbonylation reaction remains challenging, and nickel-catalyzed four-component carbonylative reaction has not been reported yet. Here, we report a highly selective nickel-catalyzed four-component carbocarbonylation of alkenes under 1 atm (1 atm) of CO gas to efficiently achieve an array of complex carbonyl compounds, including fluorinated amino acids and oligopeptides of great interest in medicinal chemistry and chemical biology. This reaction relies on a nickel-catalyzed one-pot cascade process to assemble CO, arylboronic acids, and difluoroalkyl electrophiles across the carbon-carbon double bond of alkenes, paving a new way for base-metal-catalyzed carbonylative cascade reaction. © 2020 ACS.

abstract={Fluoropolymers are a group of polymers within the class of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the evidence regarding the environmental and human health impacts of fluoropolymers throughout their life cycle(s). Production of some fluoropolymers is intimately linked to the use and emissions of legacy and novel PFAS as polymer processing aids. There are serious concerns regarding the toxicity and adverse effects of fluorinated processing aids on humans and the environment. A variety of other PFAS, including monomers and oligomers, are emitted during the production, processing, use, and end-of-life treatment of fluoropolymers. There are further concerns regarding the safe disposal of fluoropolymers and their associated products and articles at the end of their life cycle. While recycling and reuse of fluoropolymers is performed on some industrial waste, there are only limited options for their recycling from consumer articles. The evidence reviewed in this analysis does not find a scientific rationale for concluding that fluoropolymers are of low concern for environmental and human health. Given fluoropolymers' extreme persistence; emissions associated with their production, use, and disposal; and a high likelihood for human exposure to PFAS, their production and uses should be curtailed except in cases of essential uses. ©},

abstract={Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is bioaccumulative in crops. PFOA bioaccumulation potential varies largely among crop varieties. Root exudates are found to be associated with such variations. Concentrations of low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) in root exudates from a PFOA-high-accumulation lettuce variety are observed significantly higher than those from PFOA-low-accumulation lettuce variety (p < 0.05). Root exudates and their LMWOAs components exert great influences on the linear sorption-desorption isotherms of PFOA in soils, thus activating PFOA and enhancing its bioavailability. Among root exudate components, oxalic acid is identified to play a key role in activating PFOA uptake, with >80% attribution. Oxalic acid at rhizospheric concentrations (0.02-0.5 mM) can effectively inhibit PFOA sorption to soils by decreasing hydrophobic force, electrostatic attraction, ligand exchange, and cation-bridge effect. Oxalic acid enhances dissolution of metallic ions, iron/aluminum oxides, and organic matters from soils and forms oxalate-metal complexes, based on nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, ultraviolet spectra, and analyses of metal ions, iron/aluminum organometallic complexes, and dissolved organic carbon. The findings not only reveal the activation process of PFOA in soils by root exudates, particularly oxalic acid at rhizospheric concentrations, but also give an insight into the mechanism of enhancing PFOA accumulation in lettuce varieties. ©},

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are known organic pollutants with adverse health effects on humans and the ecosystem. This paper synthesises literature about the status of the pollutants and their precursors, identifies knowledge gaps and discusses future perspectives on the study of PFASs in Africa. Limited data on PFASs prevalence in Africa is available because there is limited capacity to monitor PFASs in African laboratories. The levels of PFASs in Africa are higher in samples from urban and industrialized areas compared to rural areas. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are the dominant PFASs in human samples from Africa. Levels of PFOS and PFOA in these samples are lower than or comparable to those from industrialized countries. PFOA and PFOS levels in drinking water in Africa are, in some cases, higher than the EPA drinking water guidelines suggesting potential risk to humans. The levels of PFASs in birds' eggs from South Africa are higher, while those in other environmental media from Africa are lower or comparable to those from industrialized countries. Diet influences the pollutant levels in fish, while size and sex affect their accumulation in crocodiles. No bioaccumulation of PFASs in aquatic systems in Africa could be confirmed due to small sample sizes. Reported sources of PFASs in Africa include municipal landfills, inefficient wastewater treatment plants, consumer products containing PFASs, industrial wastewater and urban runoff. Relevant stakeholders need to take serious action to identify and deal with the salient sources of PFASs on the African continent. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The recent development of an in vivo solid-phase microextraction (SPME) method capable of analyzing drugs and metabolic products in biofluids and living tissues holds great promise. The standard in vivo SPME protocol based on mass spectrometry is a very powerful analytical approach, but it is not practical for on-site analysis in many cases. In this paper, we present a fluorescence-based SPME method and a prototype of a portable fluorometer that is capable of quickly quantifying concentrations of the anticancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX). The instrument uses thin coated, biocompatible SPME fibers, which we have previously presented as a chemical biopsy tool for use during in vivo lung perfusion (IVLP) procedures within a hospital setting. In this research, we test SPME fibers with C8-SCX, C18, and HLB coatings with our fluorometer. The mixed-mode C8-SCX fibers showed the best sensitivity of the three and were therefore used to examine DOX extraction from perfusate solution and a homogenized lamb lung tissue. The maximum concentration of free active sites in the C8-SCX fiber and the adsorption equilibrium constant were determined to be (9.1 ± 0.3) × 10-7 mol m-2 and 420 ± 30 m3 mol-1, respectively. Finally, the detection limits for DOX extracted from buffer, perfusate, and lung tissue were 40, 100, and 3700 μg L-1, respectively. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Studies have shown that mammalian testes, in particular the Sertoli cells, are highly susceptible to exposure of environmental toxicants, such as cadmium, perfluorooctanesulfonate, phthalates, 2,5-hexanedione and bisphenol A. However, important studies conducted by reproductive toxicologists and/or biologists in the past have been treated as toxicology reports per se. Yet, many of these studies provided important mechanistic insights on the toxicant-induced testis injury and reproductive dysfunction, relevant to the biology of the testis and spermatogenesis. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that findings obtained from toxicant models are exceedingly helpful tools to unravel the biology of testis function in particular spermatogenesis, including specific cellular events associated with spermatid transport to support spermiogenesis and spermiation. In this review, we critically evaluate some recent data, focusing primarily on the molecular structure and role of microtubules in cellular function, illustrating the importance of toxicant models to unravel the biology of microtubule cytoskeleton in supporting spermatogenesis, well beyond information on toxicology. These findings have opened up some potential areas of research which should be carefully evaluated in the years to come. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Introduction: Urbanization is associated with major changes in environmental and lifestyle exposures that may influence metabolic signatures. Objectives: We investigated cross-sectional urban and rural differences in plasma metabolome analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry platform in 500 Chinese adults aged 25–68 years from two neighboring southern Chinese provinces. Methods: We first examined the overall metabolome differences by urban and rural residential location, using Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) and random forest classification. We then tested the association between urbanization status and individual metabolites using a linear regression adjusting for age, sex, and province and conducted pathway analysis (Fisher’s exact test) to identify metabolic pathways differed by urbanization status. Results: We observed distinct overall metabolome by urbanization status in OPLS-DA and random forest classification. Using linear regression, out of a total of 1108 unique metabolite features identified in this sample, we found that 266 metabolites were differed by urbanization status (positive false discovery rate-adjusted p-value, q-value < 0.05). For example, the following metabolites were positively associated with urbanization status: caffeine metabolites from xanthine metabolism, hazardous pollutants like 4-hydroxychlorothalonil and perfluorooctanesulfonate, and metabolites implicated in cardiometabolic diseases, such as branched-chain amino acids. In pathway analysis, we found that xanthine metabolism pathways differed by urbanization status (q-value = 1.64E−04). Conclusion: We detected profound differences in host metabolites by urbanization status. Urban residents were characterized by metabolites signaling caffeine metabolism and toxic pollutants and metabolites on known pathways to cardiometabolic disease risks, compared to their rural counterparts. Our findings highlight the importance of considering urbanization in metabolomics analysis. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The use of functional traits (FTs) can provide quantitative information to explain macrophyte ecology more effectively than traditional taxonomic-based methods. This research aims to elucidate the trait-based approaches used in recent macrophyte studies to outline their applications, shortcomings, and future challenges. A systematic literature review focused on macrophytes and FTs was carried out on Scopus database (last accessed May 2020). The latest 520 papers published from 2010 to 2020, which represent 70 % of the whole literature selected since 1969, were carefully screened. Reviewed studies mainly investigated: 1) the role of FTs in shaping communities; 2) the responses of macrophytes to environmental gradients; 3) the application of FTs in monitoring anthropic pressures; and 4) the reasons for success of invasive species. Studied areas were concentrated in Europe (41 %) and Asia (32 %), overlooking other important biodiversity hotspots, and only 6.2 % of the world macrophytes species were investigated in dedicated single species studies. The FTs most commonly used include leaf economic and morphological traits, and we noticed a lack of attention on root traits and in general on spatial traits patterns, as well as a relatively poor understanding of how FTs mediate biotic interactions. High-throughput techniques, such as remote sensing, allow to map fine-scale variability of selected traits within and across systems, helping to clarify multiple links of FTs with ecological drivers and processes. We advise to promote investigations on root traits, and to push forward the integration of multiple approaches to better clarify the role of macrophytes at multiple scales. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this work, a miniaturized flow-through leaching test is presented for rapid screening of potential chemical extractants to explore the bioaccessibility of lead (Pb) in contaminated shooting range soils in Valkeala, Finland. The method combines the versatility of microcolumn-based extraction methods with on-line inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) analysis for expedient assessment of the magnitude of the bioaccessible pools and the leaching kinetics of lead from polluted soils under variable physicochemical scenarios. Acids and salt solutions were studied as potential extractants. The efficiency of the extractants relative to the initial total amount of lead in the soil sample (509 ± 21 mg/kg) were found to increase in the following order: 0.11 M acetic acid (55%) &lt; 1 M MgCl2 (58%) &lt; 0.1 M NH2OH·HCl (61%) &lt; 0.1 M citric acid (93%) &lt; 0.1 M HCl (96%). The proposed on-line microcolumn-based method was further explored for implementation of the modified BCR (now termed Standards, Measurements and Testing Programme, SM&amp;T) sequential extraction procedure to avail the information about different fractions available in the solid sample, and validated by mass balance calculations. The equivalent sequential procedure in a batch format was then studied and compared against the on-line microcolumn extraction method. The on-line dynamic extraction system presented in this work accepts a substantial amount of sample (2.5 g) as compared to previous flow-through mini-column setups (generally accommodating &lt; 0.25 g of sample), thus maintaining sample representativeness and fostering comprehension of the extraction patterns for non-homogenous soil materials. The use of cotton buds and Teflon membranes and holders in the microcolumn setup facilitates the repeatable flow-through leaching of trace elements and restrict formation of preferential channels. Monitoring of the leachable trace elements in real time delivers detailed insight into the ongoing extraction process and provides a time-saving assessment of potential chemical extractants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Previous clinical practice guidelines of knee osteoarthritis mainly focused on tibiofemoral joint osteoarthritis, whereas PFOA has drawn more attention in recent years. Therefore, it is necessary to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of PFOA in the clinical setting. The Guideline Working Panel, consisted of clinical specialists in the field of orthopaedic joint surgery, adopted methods in accordance to WHO guideline handbook when making the present guideline. Firstly, several rounds of online survey of clinicians was conducted to determine important clinical questions. After reviewing of the literatures concerning published systematic reviews, clinical trials, and observational studies in the field of PFOA and evaluation of quality of the evidence found, determination of consensus recommendations and strength of these recommendations were performed following several rounds of Delphi process. Ultimately, a total of 12 recommendations, involving the diagnosis (symptoms, signs and imaging changes), non-surgical (primary treatment and pharmacotherapy) and surgical interventions (repair and reconstruction) of PFOA, were developed. The present guideline aimed to guide decision-making of diagnosis and treatment of PFOA in clinical practices in China. Copyright © 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association.},

abstract={Numerous experimental and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that exposure to PM2.5 may result in pathogenesis of several major cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which can be attributed to the combined adverse effects induced by the complicated components of PM2.5. Organic materials, which are major components of PM2.5, contain thousands of chemicals, and most of them are environmental hazards. However, the contamination profile and contribution to overall toxicity of PM2.5-bound organic components (OCs) have not been thoroughly evaluated yet. Herein, we aim to provide an overview of the literature on PM2.5-bound hydrophobic OCs, with an emphasis on the chemical identity and reported impairments on the cardiovascular system, including the potential exposure routes and mechanisms. We first provide an update on the worldwide mass concentration and composition data of PM2.5, and then, review the contamination profile of PM2.5-bound hydrophobic OCs, including constitution, concentration, distribution, formation, source, and identification. In particular, the link between exposure to PM2.5-bound hydrophobic OCs and CVDs and its possible underlying mechanisms are discussed to evaluate the possible risks of PM2.5-bound hydrophobic OCs on the cardiovascular system and to provide suggestions for future studies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), also referred to as multipotent stromal cells or mesenchymal stromal cells, are present in multiple tissues and capable of differentiating into diverse cell lineages, holding a great promise in developing cell-based therapy for a wide range of conditions. Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is a common degenerative disease in women and may diminish a woman's quality of life at any age. Since the treatments for this disease are limited by the high rates of recurrence and surgical complications, seeking an ideal therapy in the restoration of pelvic floor function is an urgent issue at present. Herein, we summarize the cell sources of MSCs used for PFDs and discuss the potential mechanisms of MSCs in treating PFDs. Specifically, we also provide a comprehensive review of current preclinical and clinical trials dedicated to investigating MSC-based therapy for PFDs. The novel therapy has presented promising therapeutic effects which include relieving the symptoms of urinary or fecal incontinence, improving the biological properties of implanted meshes and promoting the injured tissue repair. Nevertheless, MSC-based therapies for PFDs are still experimental and the unstated issues on their safety and efficacy should be carefully addressed before their clinical applications. © 2020 The Author(s).},

We therefore conducted a network meta-analysis to compare eight surgical interventions, including DHS, CHS, PCCP, Medoff sliding plate, LISS, Gamma nail, PFN, and PFNA, to provide the optimal surgical intervention for intertrochanteric fracture. Methods: An electronic search of 4 databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, and Web of Science) from inception to July 2020. Two or more of the eight surgical interventions, including the DHS, CHS, PCCP, Medoff sliding plate, LISS, Gamma nail, PFN, and PFNA, for intertrochanteric fracture were included. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias (ROB) tool. Network meta-analysis was conducted by using R-3.5.1 software with the help of package "gemtc". The odd ratios (ORs) with 95% credibility interval (CrI) were used to assess complications and standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% CrI to calculate the continuous outcomes (operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and Harris hip score). Surfaces under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA) were used to rank the intervention. Results: A total of 36 RCTs were included in this study. The results of this network meta-analysis showed that, compared with the CHS and DHS group, PFNA exhibited a beneficial role in reducing the blood loss (SMD, 152.50; 95% CrI, 72.93 to 232.45; and SMD, 184.40; 95% CrI, 132.99 to 235.90, respectively). PFNA achieved the lowest value for the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for the blood loss (SURCA = 0.072) and highest of Harris hip score (SURCA = 0.912). PCCP may have the lowest probability of the operative time (SURCA = 0.095). There were no significant differences among the eight surgical procedures in complications. Conclusion: PFNA technique is the optimal treatment method for intertrochanteric fracture. Larger, longitudinal RCTs addressing current limitations, including sources of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, are needed to provide more robust and consistent evidence. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={The basis of coronavirus disease is an infectious process, ac-companied by a varying degree of activity of pathological pro-cesses. Based on the study of the pathological course of infection, modern approaches to the treatment and prevention of complications of coronavirus infection are presented. The main strategic pathogenetic direction in the creation of effective programs for the treatment of COVID-19, as well as the prevention of fatal com-plications, should be a set of measures enhancing permissive regulatory influences and events. Endothelium, being a source of inflammatory mediators and a transducer of their regulatory effects on the vascular tone, is involved in the development and alterna-tion of vascular reactions, changing the volume of perfusion. The main mechanism for the development of endothelial dysfunction and damage is associated with an imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species and the power of the antioxidant defense system. Any measures to protect the endothelium, reduc-ing the severity of microcirculatory disorders and hypoxia, will have a therapeutic and preventive effect on fatal complications. In this regard, in the treatment of COVID-19, the use of synthetic gas transport preparations based on perfluorocarbon nanodispersed emulsions with a clinical effect directed at once to several patho-genetic links underlying the progression of COVID-19 disease can be quite effective. The necessity of a comprehensive effect on pathogenesis using sanogenetic principles of treatment, allowing influencing the speed and time of onset of resolution of inflamma-tion, which can reduce the number of complications and deaths of the disease, is substantiated.

Lipid-soluble POPs, like dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides are transported by lipoproteins and accumulate in adipose tissue. High levels of these compounds in the circulation have been associated with elevated cholesterol and triglycerides in cross-sectional studies and with an increase in mainly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a longitudinal study. Also, non-lipid-soluble POPs, such as perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) compounds have been associated with increased total cholesterol levels. Carotid artery atherosclerosis has been related to elevated levels of mainly highly chlorinated PCBs and to highly fluorinated PFASs, but in this case only in women. Both cross-sectional and prospective studies have shown dioxins, PCBs, as well as PFASs to be linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. In conclusion, as highlighted in this review, several lines of evidence support the view that POPs of different chemical classes could be linked to lipid abnormalities, carotid atherosclerosis and overt CVD like myocardial infarction and stroke. © 2020 The Korean Society of Lipid and Atherosclerosis.},

abstract={Motivation Determining intracellular metabolic flux through isotope labeling techniques such as 13C metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) incurs significant cost and effort. Previous studies have shown transcriptomic data coupled with constraint-based metabolic modeling can determine intracellular fluxes that correlate highly with 13C-MFA measured fluxes and can achieve higher accuracy than constraint-based metabolic modeling alone. These studies, however, used validation data limited to E. coli and S. cerevisiae grown on glucose, with significantly similar flux distribution for central metabolism. It is unclear whether those results apply to more diverse metabolisms, and therefore further, extensive validation is needed. Results In this paper, we formed a dataset of transcriptomic data coupled with corresponding 13C-MFA flux data for 21 experimental conditions in different unicellular organisms grown on varying carbon substrates and conditions. Three computational flux-balance analysis (FBA) methods were comparatively assessed. The results show when uptake rates of carbon sources and key metabolites are known, transcriptomic data provides no significant advantage over constraint-based metabolic modeling (average correlation coefficients, transcriptomic E-Flux2 0.725 and SPOT 0.650 vs non-transcriptomic pFBA 0.768). When uptake rates are unknown, however, predictions obtained utilizing transcriptomic data are generally good and significantly better than those obtained using constraint-based metabolic modeling alone (E-Flux2 0.385 and SPOT 0.583 vs pFBA 0.237). Thus, transcriptomic data coupled with constraint-based metabolic modeling is a promising method to obtain intracellular flux estimates in microorganisms, particularly in cases where uptake rates of key metabolites cannot be easily determined, such as for growth in complex media or in vivo conditions. © 2020 Bhadra-Lobo et al.},

abstract={Purpose of Review: The aim of this paper is to review the current evidence for physical therapy (PT) in the treatment of pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) in women throughout the female lifespan. Recent Findings: Although trials are small and heterogeneous, there is an increase in evidence to support PT as a safe, effective treatment option for women with PFDs at various life stages. Evidence to support PT interventions for pelvic floor conditions including dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause are discussed. Clinicians are recommended to consider prevention and wellness strategies to promote pelvic health for women and screen for PFDs for early intervention. Summary: At various stages along the lifespan, a woman may be at risk for PFDs, impacting function, and quality of life. Knowledge of the potential risk factors based on a women’s history and life stage to appropriately screen for PFDs may facilitate early intervention. Pelvic health PT is considered to be a low risk, effective treatment option for women with PFDs. Future research is needed to determine longer term outcomes and potential prevention strategies for women on a larger scale. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Purpose of Review: This review summarizes studies highlighting perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and their effects on the placenta, pregnancy outcomes, and child health. It highlights human population-based associations as well as in vitro-based experimental data to inform an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these health effects. Among the mechanisms by which PFAS may induce toxicity is via their interaction with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), nuclear receptors that regulate lipid metabolism and placental functions important to healthy pregnancies, as well as fetal and child development. Recent Findings: In utero exposure to prevalent environmental contaminants such as PFAS is associated with negative health outcomes during pregnancy, birth outcomes, and later in life. Specifically, PFAS have been associated with increased incidence of gestational diabetes, childhood obesity, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. In terms of placental molecular mechanisms underlying these associations, studies demonstrate that PFAS interfere with trophoblast lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and invasion. Moreover these effects could be mediated in part by the interaction between PFAS and PPARs, as well as other biological mechanisms. Summary: This review summarizes how PFAS, critical environmental contaminants, may contribute to diseases of pregnancy as well as early and later child health. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In Florida, high PFAS levels have been detected in the ground water, surface water, soils and sediments near military bases, airports, and firefighting training facilities. Recently, a drinking water assessment conducted by the EWG has identified Miami, Florida as the U.S city with the third highest levels of PFAS among 44 locations assessed. This critical review presents a summary of the recent literature, databases, and investigations of PFAS contamination in Florida, focusing on PFAS occurrence, major sources and treatment methods. The major PFAS sources identified are divided into the usage of aqueous film forming foams (AFFF), landfills, and wastewater treatment plants. Despite the lack of comprehensive studies in Florida, toxicity concerns are also discussed. Major knowledge gaps and future research needs are considered. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, the effects of perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA) on bacterial communities were determined by Illumina Miseq sequencing and Illumina Hiseq Xten. The stimulation of PFCs pollutants on soil bacterial richness and community diversity were observed. Sequencing information indicated that Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Gemmatimonadetes were the dominant bacterial phyla. Two genera, Bacillus and Sphingomonas, exhibited adverse responses toward PFCs pollution. Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and NCBI databases were used to elucidate the proteins and function action of soil microbial to PFCs pollution. Pathways such as Carbohydrate metabolism, Global and overview maps and Membrane transport in the soil microbes were affected by PFCs stress. CAZy analysis revealed that glycosyl transferases (GTs) in PFCs-polluted soils showed more active, while glycoside hydrolases (GHs) were inhibited severely. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This systematic review examines biomonitoring studies that have assessed firefighter occupational exposure to chemicals due to combustion. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Firefighters are exposed to a wide range of toxic chemicals due to combustion, with numerous biomonitoring studies completed that have assessed exposure. Many of these studies focus on individual classes of chemicals, with a few considering a broad range of systemic exposures. As yet, no review process has been undertaken to comprehensively examine these studies. The aims of this review are to: (1) ascertain whether biomonitoring studies pertaining to firefighters demonstrate occupational exposure to volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, and metals; (2) determine and present results of biomonitoring studies; (3) provide any recommendations presented from the literature that may support exposure mitigation; and (4) suggest future study parameters that may assist in providing a greater understanding surrounding the occupational exposure of firefighters. A systematic review was undertaken with regards to firefighters and biomonitoring studies utilising the matrices of blood, urine, semen and breast milk. This yielded 5690 results. Following duplicate removal, inclusion and exclusion criteria screening and full text screening, 34 studies remained for review. Results of over 80% of studies analysed determined firefighters to experience occupational exposure. Results also show firefighters to be exposed to a wide range of toxic chemicals due to fire smoke; potentially exceeding the range of exposure of other occupations. As firefighters may face increased risk of health effects due to the additive, synergistic, and/or antagonistic effects of chemical exposure, all care must be taken to reduce exposure. This may be achieved by considering tactical decisions, increased personal hygiene, and thorough decontamination procedures. Future biomonitoring studies recognising and assessing the range of chemical exposure firefighters face would be beneficial. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={There is growing concern that microplastics (MPs), which act as carriers of other organic contaminants, are mistakenly ingested by aquatic organisms, consequently causing unpredictable adverse effects. In this study, zebrafish larvae (6 d post fertilization) were exposed to either 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F–53B), polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) or their combination for 7 d to evaluate the effects of the presence of PS-MPs on the bioaccumulation and immunomodulation of F–53B. PS-MPs greatly promoted the sorption of F–53B, which reduced the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of F–53B in zebrafish larvae. F–53B, PS-MPs, or their mixture significantly reduced the body weight of zebrafish larvae. Combined exposure of PS-MPs and F–53B resulted in a significant reduction in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lysozyme activity, indicating the occurrence of oxidative stress and inflammatory response in zebrafish larvae. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) was not affected by F–53B or PS-MPs, but significantly increased in their combined exposure. Furthermore, co-exposure of F–53B and PS-MPs significantly upregulated the transcripts of pro-inflammatory cxcl-clc and il-1β genes and increased the levels of iNOS protein in zebrafish larvae. In addition, enhanced protein expression of NF-κB paralleled the upregulation in the expression of most immune-related genes, suggesting NF-κB pathway was mechanistically involved in these responses. Collectively, the presence of MPs decreased F–53B bioaccumulation, but induced inflammatory stress in larval zebrafish. These findings highlight the health risks of co-contamination of MPs and F–53B in aquatic environments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={PPCPs (pharmaceutical and personal care products) and microplastics (MPs) are two types of emerging pollutants that are ubiquitous and widely concerned in the environment. Both of them can accumulate in fish or aquatic invertebrates and transfer to offspring, thereby producing toxic effects on both parents and offspring, in which the characteristics of MPs also enable them to adsorb PPCPs thus producing carrier effects. In this study, we have conducted a comprehensive review of MPs and PPCPs and found that MPs can act as a carrier of PPCPs to influence the bioaccumulation of PPCPs. MPs and PPCPs have toxicity and transgenerational effects on both fish and aquatic invertebrates in many aspects, and MPs can also affect the toxicity and transgenerational effects of PPCPs due to their carrier effects. This paper revealed that MPs may have an important impact on the bioavailability of PPCPs and the interaction between MPs and PPCPs is a hot topic in future research. This study also puts forward the shortcomings of the current research and related suggestions, and relevant research should be carried out as soon as possible to provide the basis for the prevention and treatment of fresh water. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Exposure to environmental pollutants may produce impairment of male reproductive health. The epidemiological literature evaluating potential consequences of human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has grown in recent years with concerns for both pre- and postnatal influences. The aim of this systematic review was to assess available evidence on associations between PFAS exposures in different stages of life and semen quality, reproductive hormones, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and testicular cancer. A systematic search of literature published prior to March 9th, 2020, was performed in the databases PubMed and Embase®. Predefined criteria for eligibility were applied by two authors screening study records independently. Among the 242 study records retrieved in the literature search, 26 studies were eligible for qualitative assessment. While several investigations suggested weak associations for single compounds and specific outcomes, a lack of consistency across studies limited conclusions of overall evidence. The current gap in knowledge is particularly obvious regarding exposures prior to adulthood, exposure to combinations of both PFAS and other types of environmental chemicals, and outcomes such as cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and testicular cancer. Continued efforts to clarify associations between PFAS exposure and male reproductive health through high-quality epidemiological studies are needed. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.},

To prepare the present review, the relevant papers were identified by searching the Scopus database and extracting papers from 2007 to 2020. There is a wide variety of different membranes, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Perfluorinated and non-fluorinated membranes were evaluated based on different properties, including proton conductivity, power density (PD), water uptake, and ion exchange capacity. Results reveal that non-fluorinated membranes such as sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK), graphene oxide/SPEEK (GO/SPEEK), polyethersulfone (PES) and polysulfone (PS) and sulfonated polybenzimidazole (S-OPBI) are a good choice to replace the commonly used membrane Nafion™ because of their lower cost and higher energy recovery. Sulfonated membranes such as polyethersulfone/SPEEK (PES/SPEEK) and Sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES) show the highest normalized energy recovery. Although Nafion™ has the highest proton conductivity and is an excellent choice as proton exchange membrane (PEM) for MFCs, its energy recovery capacity is lower than that of porous and microfiltration membranes. It can also be very sensitive to biofouling. In the following, different parameters of membrane characterization and also wastewater treatment are discussed. The energy recovery of the membranes and systems studied was measured in order to recommend a suitable membrane for MFCs to improve the efficiency of these systems in terms of clean electricity generation and wastewater treatment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the growing field of metabolic engineering, where cells are treated as ‘factories’ that synthesize industrial compounds, it is essential to consider the ability of the cells’ native metabolism to accommodate the demands of synthetic pathways, as these pathways will alter the homeostasis of cellular energy and electron metabolism. From the breakdown of substrate, microorganisms activate and reduce key co-factors such as ATP and NAD(P)H, which subsequently need to be hydrolysed and oxidized, respectively, in order to restore cellular balance. A balanced supply and consumption of such co-factors, here termed co-factor balance, will influence biotechnological performance. To aid the strain selection and design process, we used stoichiometric modelling (FBA, pFBA, FVA and MOMA) and the Escherichia coli (E.coli) core stoichiometric model to investigate the network-wide effect of butanol and butanol precursor production pathways differing in energy and electron demand on product yield. An FBA-based co-factor balance assessment (CBA) algorithm was developed to track and categorise how ATP and NAD(P)H pools are affected in the presence of a new pathway. CBA was compared to the balance calculations proposed by Dugar et al. (Nature Biotechnol. 29 (12), 1074–1078). Predicted solutions were compromised by excessively underdetermined systems, displaying greater flexibility in the range of reaction fluxes than experimentally measured by 13C-metabolic flux analysis (MFA) and the appearance of unrealistic futile co-factor cycles. With the assumption that futile cycles are tightly regulated in reality, the FBA models were manually constrained in a step-wise manner. Solutions with minimal futile cycling diverted surplus energy and electrons towards biomass formation. As an alternative, the use of loopless FBA or constraining the models with measured flux ranges were tried but did not prevent futile co-factor cycles. The results highlight the need to account for co-factor imbalance and confirm that better-balanced pathways with minimal diversion of surplus towards biomass formation present the highest theoretical yield. The analysis also suggests that ATP and NAD(P)H balancing cannot be assessed in isolation from each other, or even from the balance of additional co-factors such as AMP and ADP. We conclude that, through revealing the source of co-factor imbalance CBA can facilitate pathway and host selection when designing new biocatalysts for implementation by metabolic engineering.

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are pollutants have attracted major concern due to their high persistence and bioaccumulation. They are causing increasingly serious epidemiological problems in many communities globally due to consuming PFAS-contaminated water sources. Necessarily, the behavior of PFAS in water and wastewater needs to be understood better. This study attempts to comprehensively review, analyze and discuss PFAS based on the following key aspects: (i) sources, (ii) occurrence in water and wastewater, (iii) transformation, fate and migration, and (iv) remediation technologies. Studies indicated that modern water and wastewater treatment plants cannot deal completely with PFAS and in some cases, the removal efficiency is minus -3500-fold. The main reasons are the high hydrophobicity of PFAS and presence of PFAS precursors. Precursors can account for 33–63% of total PFAS concentration in water and wastewater. Detection and identification of precursors are challenging due to the requirement of advanced analytical instrument and standard chemicals. Several technologies have been developed for PFAS remediation involving two main mechanisms: separation-concentration and destruction. The most widespread in-use technology is adsorption because it is reasonably affordable. Anion exchange resin and synthesized materials are the most effective sorbents having a sorption capacity of 100–2000 mg PFAS/g sorbent, effective within a few hours. The destruction technology such as plasma can also be a promising one for degrading PFAS to below health-based standard in 1 min. However, plasma is costly and not yet ready for full scale application. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: The evidence evaluating environmental chemical exposures (ECE) and breast cancer (BC) risk is heterogeneous which may stem in part as few studies measure ECE during key BC windows of susceptibility (WOS). Another possibility may be that most BC studies are skewed towards individuals at average risk, which may limit the ability to detect signals from ECE. Objectives: We reviewed the literature on ECE and BC focusing on three types of studies or subgroup analyses based on higher absolute BC risk: BC family history (Type 1); early onset BC (Type 2); and/or genetic susceptibility (Type 3). Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed database to identify epidemiologic studies examining ECE and BC risk published through June 1, 2019. Results: We identified 100 publications in 56 unique epidemiologic studies. Of these 56 studies, only 2 (3.6%) were enriched with BC family history and only 11% of studies (6/56) were specifically enriched with early onset cases. 80% of the publications from these 8 enriched studies (Type 1: 8/10 publications; Type 2: 8/10 publications) supported a statistically significant association between ECE and BC risk including studies of PAH, indoor cooking, NO2, DDT; PCBs, PFOSA; metals; personal care products; and occupational exposure to industrial dyes. 74% of Type 3 publications (20/27) supported statistically significant associations for PAHs, traffic-related air pollution, PCBs, phthalates, and PFOSAs in subgroups of women with greater genetic susceptibility due to variants in carcinogen metabolism, DNA repair, oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis and tumor suppressor genes. Discussion: Studies enriched for women at higher BC risk through family history, younger age of onset and/or genetic susceptibility consistently support an association between an ECE and BC risk. In addition to measuring exposures during WOS, designing studies that are enriched with women at higher absolute risk are necessary to robustly measure the role of ECE on BC risk. © 2020 The Authors},

Topiramate is used as an antiepileptic drug for the treatment of partial onset seizures, generalized seizures and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Topiramate, a BCS class II drug, has a relatively low bioavailability. It is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein and Blood Brain Barrier restricts its entry into the brain. This investigation was aimed to prepare O/W nanoemulsion delivery system of topiramate to improve its brain bioavailability. Topiramate loaded nanoemulsion was prepared by phase titration method. It was consisting of 2% w/w Capmul MCM C8, 32% w/w Tween 20:Carbitol (2:1) and 66% w/w water. It was characterized for globule size, viscosity, polydispersibility index, zeta potential, pH, conductivity values, transmittance and TEM. Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and brain drug uptake study was carried out using wistar albino rats post intranasal and oral administration. Topiramate loaded nanoemulsion was having a globule size of 4.73 ± 0.52 nm. It was stable for six months. Brain uptake of topiramate post intranasal administration of topiramate loaded nanoemulsion was significantly (P &lt; 1.86 × 10−8) higher when it was compared with oral administration of topiramate loaded nanoemulsion. This study indicates that intranasal administration of topiramate containing nanoemulsion could be an encouraging approach for the treatment of epilepsy to minimize the dose of topiramate in direction to avoid dose related adverse events. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are dietary components with a chain length ranging from 6 to 12 carbon atoms. MCFA can cross the blood-brain barrier and in the brain can be oxidized through mitochondrial β-oxidation. As components of ketogenic diets, MCFA have demonstrated beneficial effects on different brain diseases, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer’s disease, drug-resistant epilepsy, diabetes, and cancer. Despite the interest in MCFA effects, not much information is available about MCFA metabolism in the brain. In this study, with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics approach, coupled with multivariate data analyses, we followed the metabolic changes of U87MG glioblastoma cells after the addition of octanoic (C8), or decanoic (C10) acids for 24 h. Our analysis highlighted significant differences in the metabolism of U87MG cells after the addition of C8 or C10 and identified several metabolites whose amount changed between the two groups of treated cells. Overall, metabolic pathway analyses suggested the citric acid cycle, Warburg effect, glutamine/glutamate metabolism, and ketone body metabolism as pathways influenced by C8 or C10 addition to U87MG cells. Our data demonstrated that, while C8 affected mitochondrial metabolism resulting in increased ketone body production, C10 mainly influenced cytosolic pathways by stimulating fatty acid synthesis. Moreover, glutamine might be the main substrate to support fatty acids synthesis in C10-treated cells. In conclusion, we identified a metabolic signature associated with C8 or C10 addition to U87MG cells that can be used to decipher metabolic responses of glioblastoma cells to MCFA treatment. © Copyright © 2020 Damiano, De Benedetto, Longo, Giannotti, Fico, Siculella and Giudetti.},

abstract={Emerging contaminants (EPs) represent a significant risk to human, ecological and environmental health. Although progress has been made in establishing monitoring in environmental matrices, health effects, legislation and control, there are still problems associated with regional bias and the types of EPs commonly assessed, which may underestimate the risk to health. In Latin America there are limited reports on environmental monitoring of EPs and it is generally focused on wastewater. This review identifies the current research deficiencies for emerging contaminants in the Latin American region, and we address the case of nonylphenol as an under-studied EP in the region. Nonylphenol is a degradation product of nonylphenol ethoxylate, which is a surfactant widely used in the manufacture of detergents in Latin America, environmental concentrations have been reported, predominantly in water, and the possible effects on species in this region have been also described. The importance of the review of this compound in the region lies in the fact that the Rotterdam Convention has catalogued nonylphenol as a severely restricted compound, so it is necessary to establish measures for its restriction and change to a sustainable technology. Finally, the example of NP presented in this review highlights the lack of regulation in Latin America regarding to EPs, resulting in the contamination of wastewater, effluents, rivers and drinking water. It is imperative to determine the potential effects, occurrence and concentration levels to improve the regulation of these pollutants in a timely manner. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

This study describes a fluorous derivatization method for a more sensitive and selective analysis of reactive metabolites trapped by GSH using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). In this study, the GSH-trapped reactive metabolites, which were obtained after incubation of the test compounds with human liver microsome (HLM) in the presence of GSH and NADPH, were derivatized using the perfluoroalkylamine reagent through oxazolone chemistry. Since this reaction enabled the selective modification of the α-carboxyl group in GSH, the structural compositions of the metabolites were not affected by the derivatization. Furthermore, the selective analysis of the resulting derivatives could be performed using perfluoroalkyl-modified stationary phase LC separation via the interaction between the perfluoroalkyl-containing compounds, such as fluorous affinity, followed by detection with the precursor ion and/or enhanced product ion scan modes in MS/MS. Finally, we demonstrated the applicability of this method by analyzing perfluoroalkyl derivatives of some drug metabolites trapped by GSH in HLM incubation. © 2020},

abstract={Thallium is an emerging pollutant reported in wastewater along with the increasing mining and smelting of thallium-containing ores in recent years. The complete removal of Tl(I) from wastewater is of significant emergency due to its high toxicity and mobility, however, Tl(I) removal is always confronted with numerous technical difficulties because of the extremely low Tl(I) concentration in wastewater and the disturbances of many accompanying impurity ions. Adsorption is currently the most widely used method for Tl(I) removal on industrial scale and varied kinds of adsorbents such as Prussian blue analogues, biosorbents, and metal oxides have been developed. However, the adsorption process of Tl(I) is always affected by the co-existing cations, resulting in low Tl(I) removal efficiency. Recently, the development of a variety of novel adsorbents or ion sensors based on macrocyclic compounds for enrichment and accurate determination of trace Tl(I) in aqueous solutions exhibits great potential for application in Tl(I) removal from wastewater with high selectivity and process efficiency. This paper provides an overview of the adsorption methods for Tl(I) removal from wastewater with emphasis on complexation properties between varied types of adsorbents and Tl(I). Future directions of research and development of adsorptive Tl(I) removal from industrial wastewater are proposed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have recently been labeled as toxic constituents that exist in many aqueous environments. However, traditional methods used to determine the level of PFASs are often not appropriate for continuous environmental monitoring and management. Based on the current state of research, PFAS-detecting sensors have surfaced as a promising method of determination. These sensors are an innovative solution with characteristics that allow for in situ, low-cost, and easy-to-use capabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent developments in PFAS-detecting sensors, and why the literature on determination methods has shifted in this direction compared to the traditional methods used. PFAS-detecting sensors discussed herein are primarily categorized in terms of the detection mechanism used. The topics covered also include the current limitations, as well as insight on the future direction of PFAS analyses. This paper is expected to be useful for the smart sensing technology development of PFAS detection methods and the associated environmental management best practices in smart cities of the future. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a recently identified and persistent organic pollutant that becomes enriched in living organisms via bioaccumulation and the food chain. PFOS can induce various disorders, including liver toxicity, neurotoxicity and metabolic dysregulation. Most recent studies have shown a close association of the gut microbiota with the occurrence of diseases. However, few studies have explored the effects of PFOS on the gut environment, including the intestinal flora and barrier. In this study, we evaluated the effects of PFOS in C57BL/6J male mice and explored the relationship between tissue damage and the gut environment. Mice were orally exposed to PFOS for 16 days. Liver damage was assessed by examining the inflammatory reaction in the liver and serum liver enzyme concentrations. Metabolic function was assessed by the hepatic cholesterol level and the serum concentrations of glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides. Intestinal environmental disorders were assessed by evaluating the gut microbiota, SCFAs production, inflammatory reactions and intestinal tight junction protein expression. Our results indicated that PFOS affected inflammatory reactions in the liver and colon and promoted the development of metabolic disorders (especially of cholesterol and glucose metabolism). Moreover, PFOS dysregulated various populations in the gut microbiota (e.g., Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Clostridiales, Enterobacteriales, Lactobacillales, Erysipelotrichaceae, Rikenellaceae, Ruminococcaceae and Blautia) and induced a loss of gut barrier integrity by reducing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production and intestinal tight junction protein expression. A Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis mainly identified metabolic pathways (e.g., the adipocytokine signalling pathway), endocrine system pathways (e.g., steroid hormone biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis), the latter of which is widely considered to be associated with metabolism. Overall, our results suggest that PFOS damages various aspects of the gut environment, including the microbiota, SCFAs and barrier function, and thereby exacerbates the toxicity associated with liver, gut and metabolic disorders. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

This was a non-systematic review of literature on structural cross-sectional optical coherence tomography findings after vitreoretinal surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Adequate illustrations of the main findings described were found after a retrospective analysis of imaging and charts of patients operated at the department where this study was performed. The main structural cross-sectional optical coherence tomography findings after vitreoretinal surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment included persistent subretinal fluid, subretinal blebs, retinal folds, subretinal perfluorocarbon liquids, macular alterations related to silicone oil, epiretinal membranes, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, cystoid macular edema, macular holes, and recurrent retinal detachment. In conclusion, optical coherence tomography was a useful tool after vitreoretinal surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Some optical coherence tomography findings may not be evident on fundus examination, and optical coherence tomography can reveal essential details for the clinical management and the visual prognosis. Other findings, despite being visible on funduscopic examination, may be better assessed with the aid of optical coherence tomography. All these elements contribute to support the importance of tomographic assessment in the follow-up of eyes treated for vitreoretinal conditions. © The Author(s) 2020.},

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between exposure to EDCs and obesity. Data sources, design and eligibility criteria PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched from inception to 6 June 2018 for studies primarily addressing the association between exposure to EDCs after the age of 2 years and anthropometric measures of obesity or body fat. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias. Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers screened and conducted data extraction and synthesis. A third reviewer resolved disagreements. Results A total of 73 studies investigating bisphenol A (32 286 individuals), organochlorine compounds (34 567 individuals), phthalates (21 401 individuals), polybrominated biphenyls (2937 individuals), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (5174 individuals), parabens (4097 individuals), benzoic acid (3671 individuals) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (349 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Most had a cross-sectional design and low or medium risk of bias. In qualitative analysis, bisphenol A and phthalates were consistently associated with general and abdominal obesity, in children and adults, and some studies suggested this association was age-dependent and gender-dependent. Meta-analysis indicated a significant association between exposure to bisphenol A and overweight (OR 1.254, 95% CI 1.005 to 1.564), obesity (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.273 to 1.774) and increased waist circumference (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.267 to 1.783) in adults, and between exposure to 2,5-dichlorophenol and obesity in children (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1018 to 3.184). Conclusion Most observational studies supported a positive association between obesity and exposure to EDCs. Although causality cannot be determined from these data, they underscore the need to limit human exposure to EDCs in light of the evidence from animal and cell-based studies indicating the effects of these chemicals on adiposity.

abstract={Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) have recently been detected in bottled water and have brought about discussions on possible risks for human health. However, a systematic review of CECs in bottled water is currently lacking due to the relatively new introduction and/or detection of these pollutants. Hence, this paper reviews the existing studies on the presence of six major groups of emerging contaminants including microplastics (MPs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, alkylphenols (APs), and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in bottled water from different countries. Also, the findings related to CECs’ levels, their possible sources, and their risks are summarized. The gathered data indicate that MPs within the size range of 1−5 μm are the most predominant and potentially toxic classes of MPs in bottled water. In addition, PPCPs, PFASs, APs, and BPA occur in concentration levels of ng/L, while phthalates occur in the μg/L level in bottled water. The bottle type plays an important role in the contamination level. As expected, water in plastic bottles with plastic caps is more polluted than in glass bottles. However, other sources of contamination such as contact materials during cleaning, bottling, and storage are not negligible. Based on the gathered data in this review, the CEC levels except for MPs (no threshold values) in bottled water of most countries do not raise a safety concern for the human. However, the occurrence of individual CECs and their association in bottled water need more accurate data to understand their own/synergistic effects on human health. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

However, taking into consideration the high prevalence of PFO, the low risk of stroke recurrence under medical treatment and the uncommon yet severe adverse events of the intervention, patient selection is crucial for attaining meaningful clinical benefits. Thorough workup to exclude alternative causes of stroke and identification of high-risk PFOs through clinical, neuroimaging and echocardiographic criteria are essential.

One to 5% of people suffer from food allergies and clinicians report increasing numbers of pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS), such that the symptoms have broadened from respiratory to gastrointestinal, and even to anaphylactic shock in the presence of cofactors. Thirty to 60% of food allergies are associated with pollen allergy while the percentage of pollen allergies associated to food allergy varies according to local environment and dietary habits Areas covered: Articles published in peer-reviewed journals, covered by PubMed databank, clinical data are discussed including symptoms, diagnosis, and management. A chapter emphasizes the role of six well-known allergen families involved in PFAS: PR10 proteins, profilins, lipid transfer proteins, thaumatin-like proteins, isoflavone reductases, and β-1,3 glucanases. The relevance in PFAS of three supplementary allergen families is presented: oleosins, polygalacturonases, and gibberellin-regulated proteins. To support the discussion a few original relevant results were added. Expert opinion: Both allergenic sources, pollen and food, are submitted to the same stressful environmental changes resulting in an increase of pathogenesis-related proteins in which numerous allergens are found. This might be responsible for the potential increase of PFAS. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Background: The enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) and fast track surgery (FTS) protocols have been applied to a variety of surgeries and have been proven to reduce complications, accelerate rehabilitation, and reduce medical costs. However, the effectiveness of these protocols in minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (miRP) is still unclear. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of ERAS and FTS protocols in miRP. Methods: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases to collect randomized and observational studies comparing ERAS/FTS versus conventional care in miRP up to July 1, 2019. After screening for inclusion, data extraction, and quality assessment by two independent reviewers, the meta-analysis was performed with the RevMan 5.3 and STATA 15.1 software. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: In total, 11 studies involving 1,207 patients were included. Pooled data showed that ERAS/FTS was associated with a significant reduction in length of stay (LOS) (WMD: -2.41 days, 95% CI: -4.00 to -0.82 days, P=0.003), time to first anus exhaust (WMD: -0.74 days, 95% CI: -1.14 to -0.34 days, P=0.0003), and lower incidence of postoperative complications (RR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.92, P=0.01). No significant differences were found between groups for operation time, estimated blood loss, postoperative pain, blood transfusion rate, and readmission rate (P>0.01). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that the ERAS/FTS protocol is safe and effective in miRP. However, more extensive, long-term, prospective, multicenter follow-up studies, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are required to validate our findings. © Translational Andrology and Urology.

abstract={Polynorbornenes represent a fruitful class of polymers for structure-property study. Recently, vinyl-addition polynorbornenes bearing side groups of different natures were observed to exhibit excellent gas permeation ability, along with attractive C4H10/CH4 and CO2/N2 separation selectivities. However, to date, the gas transport properties of fluorinated addition polynorbornenes have not been reported. Herein, we synthesized addition polynorbornene with fluoroorganic substituents and executed a study on the gas transport properties of the polymer for the first time. A norbornene-type monomer with a C6F5 group, 3-pentafluorophenyl-exo-tricyclononene-7, was successfully involved in addition polymerization, resulting in soluble, high-molecular-weight products obtained in good or high yields. By varying the monomer concentration and monomer/catalyst ratio, it was possible to reach Mw values of (2.93-4.35) × 105. The molecular structure was confirmed by NMR and FTIR analysis. The contact angle with distilled water revealed the hydrophobic nature of the synthesized polymer as expected due to the presence of fluoroorganic side groups. A study of the permeability of various gases (He, H2, O2, N2, CO2, and CH4) through the prepared polymer disclosed a synergetic effect, which was achieved by the presence of both bulky perfluorinated side groups and rigid saturated main chains. Addition poly(3-pentafluorophenyl-exo-tricyclononene-7) was more permeable than its metathesis analogue by a factor of 7-21, or the similar polymer with flexible main chains, poly(pentafluorostyrene), in relation to the gases tested. Therefore, this investigation opens the door to fluorinated addition polynorbornenes as new potential polymeric materials for membrane gas separation. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of chemicals that were widely used in manufacturing and are now present in the environment throughout the world. It is known that various PFAS are quantifiable in human in blood, but potential adverse health outcomes remain unclear. Sentinel and non-traditional model species are useful to study potential toxicity of PFAS in order to understand the relationship between environmental and human health. Here, we present a critical review of studies on the neurotoxicity of PFAS in sentinel and non-traditional laboratory model systems, including Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode), Dugesia japonica (planarian), Rana pipiens (frogs), Danio rerio and Oryzias melastigma (fish), and Ursus maritimus (polar bears). PFAS have been implicated in developmental neurotoxicity in non-traditional and traditional model systems as well as sentinel species, including effects on neurotransmitter levels, especially acetylcholine and its metabolism. However, further research on the mechanisms of toxicity needs to be conducted to determine if these chemicals are affecting organisms in a similar manner. Overall, findings tend to be similar among the various species, but bioaccumulation may vary, which needs to be taken into account in future studies by quantifying target organ concentrations of PFAS to better compare different species. Furthermore, data on the majority of PFAS is lacking in neurotoxicity testing, and additional studies are needed to corroborate findings thus far. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Over the past years, a great effort has been devoted to the development of new sorbents that can be used to pack or to coat extractive capillaries for in-tube solid-phase microextraction (IT-SPME). Many of those efforts have been focused on the preparation of capillaries for miniaturized liquid chromatography (LC) due to the reduced availability of capillary columns with appropriate dimensions for this kind of system. Moreover, many of the extractive capillaries that have been used for IT-SPME so far are segments of open columns from the gas chromatography (GC) field, but the phase nature and dimensions are very limited. In particular, polar compounds barely interact with stationary GC phases. Capillary GC columns may also be unsuitable when highly selective extractions are needed. In this work, we provide an overview of the extractive capillaries that have been specifically developed for capillary LC (capLC) and nano LC (nanoLC) to enhance the overall performance of the IT-SPME, the chromatographic separation, and the detection. Different monolithic polymers, such as silica C18 and C8 polymers, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), polymers functionalized with antibodies, and polymers reinforced with different types of carbon nanotubes, metal, and metal oxide nanoparticles (including magnetic nanoparticles), and restricted access materials (RAMs) will be presented and critically discussed. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Direct mutation analysis is the major method for glutaric acidemia I (GA-I) prenatal diagnosis, while systemic application of a biochemical strategy is rare. We describe our experiences with metabolite measurement together with mutation analysis in GA-I prenatal diagnosis at a single center over 10 years. The data of genetic analysis and metabolite measurement using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry(GC/MS) and tandem mass spectrometry(MS/MS) in amniotic fluid samples of 44 fetuses from 42 GA-I families referred to our center from 2009 to 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Among these 44 fetuses, genetic and biochemical results were both available in 39 fetuses. Of these, 6 fetuses were judged as affected and 33 fetuses as unaffected by mutation analysis. The levels of glutarylcarnitine (C5DC), C5DC/octanoylcarnitine (C8), and glutaric acid in the supernatant of amniotic fluid from affected fetuses were significantly higher than those in unaffected fetuses [1.73μmol/L (0.89–4.19) vs. 0.16μmol/L (0.06–0.37), 26.26 (12.4–55.55) vs. 2.23 (1.04–8.44), and 103.94 mmol/mol creatinine (30.37–148.31) vs. 1.01mmol/mol creatinine (0–9.81), respectively; all P < 0.0001]. Among all families, two were found to have one causative mutation in the proband, in four pregnancies from these two families, three fetuses were judged as “unaffected” and one was judged as “affected” according to metabolites results. Postnatal follow-up showed a normal phenotype in all unaffected fetuses judged by mutation or metabolite analysis. C5DC, C5DC/C8, and glutaric acid levels in the supernatant of amniotic fluid showed significant differences and no overlap between the affected and unaffected fetuses. Biochemical strategy could be implemented as a quick and convenient method for the prenatal diagnosis of GA-I. © Copyright © 2020 Xiao, Qiu, Ye, Zhang, Zhu, Wang, Liang, Xu, Chen, Xu, Yu, Gu and Han.},

abstract={The endangered beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) population residing in the St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE; Eastern Canada) is declining. The elevated tissue concentrations of a wide range of organohalogen contaminants might play a role in the non-recovery of this whale population. Organohalogens have been reported to impair the regulation of several metabolic products from cellular reactions in mammals such as amino acids and fatty acids. The objective of this study was to investigate a suite of organohalogens including polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and selected emerging flame retardants in blubber (biopsy) collected from 40 SLE male belugas, and their relationships to skin concentrations of targeted metabolites (i.e., 21 amino acids, 22 biogenic amines, 18 fatty acids, and 17 energy metabolites). A cluster analysis based on metabolomic profiles distinguished two main subgroups of belugas in the upper and lower sector of their summer habitat in the SLE. These results indicate that ecological factors such as local prey availability and diet composition played a role in shaping the metabolite profiles of belugas. Moreover, SCCP concentrations in SLE male belugas correlated negatively with those of four unsaturated fatty acids (C16:1ω7, C22:5ω3c1, C22:5ω3c2, and C22:6ω3), and positively with those of acetylornithine (biogenic amine). These findings suggest that biological functions such as lipid metabolism represent potential targets for organohalogens in this population, and further our understanding on potential health risks associated with elevated organohalogen exposure in cetaceans. Our results also underscore the necessity of considering ecological factors (e.g., diet and habitat use) in metabolomic studies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Retinal detachment (RD) with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) often requires surgery to restore normal anatomy and to stabilize or improve vision. PVR usually occurs in association with recurrent RD (that is, after initial retinal re-attachment surgery), but occasionally may be associated with primary RD. Either way, for both circumstances a tamponade agent (gas or silicone oil) is needed during surgery to reduce the rate of postoperative recurrent RD. Objectives: The objective of this review was to assess the relative safety and effectiveness of various tamponade agents used with surgery for RD complicated by PVR. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to January 2019), Embase (January 1980 to January 2019), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2019), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 January 2019. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on participants undergoing surgery for RD associated with PVR that compared various tamponade agents. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors screened the search results independently. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results: We identified four RCTs (601 participants) that provided data for the primary and secondary outcomes. Three RCTs provided data on visual acuity, two reported on macular attachment, one on retinal reattachment and another two on adverse events such as RD, worsening visual acuity and intraocular pressure. Study Characteristics. Participants' characteristics varied across studies and across intervention groups, with an age range between 21 to 89 years, and were predominantly men. The Silicone Study was conducted in the USA and consisted of two RCTs: (silicone oil versus sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas tamponades; 151 participants) and (silicone oil versus perfluropropane (C3F8) gas tamponades; 271 participants). The third RCT compared heavy silicone oil (a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8) and silicone oil) with standard silicone oil (either 1000 centistokes or 5000 centistokes; 94 participants). The fourth RCT compared 1000 centistokes with 5000 centistokes silicone oil in 85 participants. We assessed most RCTs at low or unclear risk of bias for most 'Risk of bias' domains. Findings. Although SF6 gas was reported to be associated with worse anatomic and visual outcomes than was silicone oil at one year (quantitative data not reported), at two years, silicone oil compared to SF6 gas showed no evidence of a difference in visual acuity (33% versus 51%; risk ratio (RR) 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 2.66; 1 RCT, 87 participants; low-certainty evidence). At one year, another RCT comparing silicone oil and C3F8 gas found no evidence of a difference in visual acuity between the two groups (41% versus 39%; RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.31; 1 RCT, 264 participants; low-certainty evidence). In a third RCT, participants treated with standard silicone oil compared to those receiving heavy silicone oil also showed no evidence of a difference in the change in visual acuity at one year, measured on logMAR scale (mean difference -0.03 logMAR; 95% CI -0.35 to 0.29; 1 RCT; 93 participants; low-certainty evidence). The fourth RCT with 5000-centistoke and 1000-centistoke comparisons did not report data on visual acuity. For macular attachment, participants treated with silicone oil may probably experience more favorable outcomes than did participants who received SF6 at both one year (quantitative data not reported) and two years (58% versus 79%; RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.86; 1 RCT; 87 participants; low-certainty evidence). In another RCT, silicone oil compared to C3F8 at one year found no evidence of difference in macular attachment (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 1 RCT, 264 participants; low-certainty evidence). One RCT that compared 5000 centistokes to 1000 centistoke reported that retinal reattachment was successful in 67 participants (78.8%) with first surgery and 79 participants (92.9%) with the second surgery, and no evidence of between-group difference (1 RCT; 85 participants; low-certainty evidence). The fourth RCT that compared standard silicone oil with heavy silicone oil did not report on macular attachment. Adverse events. In one RCT (86 participants), those receiving standard 1000 centistoke silicone oil compared with those of the 5000 centistoke silicone oil showed no evidence of a difference in intraocular pressure elevation at 18 months (24% versus 22%; RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.41 to 1.94; low-certainty evidence), visually significant cataract (49% versus 64%; RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.89; low-certainty evidence), and incidence of retina detachment after the removal of silicone oil (RR 0.36 95% CI 0.08 to 1.67; low-certainty evidence). Another RCT that compared standard silicone oil with heavy silicone oil suggests no difference in retinal detachment at one year (25% versus 22%; RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.48; 1 RCT; 186 participants; low-certainty evidence). Retinal detachment was not reported in the RCTs that compared silicone oil versus SF6 and silicone oil versus to C3F8. Authors' conclusions: There do not appear to be any major differences in outcomes between C3F8 and silicone oil. Silicone oil may be better than SF6 for macular attachment and other short-term outcomes. The choice of a tamponade agent should be individualized for each patient. The use of either C3F8 or standard silicone oil appears reasonable for most patients with RD associated with PVR. Heavy silicone oil, which is not available for routine clinical use in the USA, may not demonstrate evidence of superiority over standard silicone oil. Copyright © 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

abstract={INTRODUCTION: To date, the evidence for an association between perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between early life exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and ADHD in a collaborative study including nine European population-based studies, encompassing 4,826 mother–child pairs. METHODS: Concentrations of PFOS and PFOA were measured in maternal serum/plasma during pregnancy, or in breast milk, with different timing of sample collection in each cohort. We used a validated pharmacokinetic model of pregnancy and lactation to estimate concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in children at birth and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of age. We classified ADHD using recommended cutoff points for each instrument used to derive symptoms scores. We used multiple imputation for missing covariates, logistic regression to model the association between PFAS exposure and ADHD in each study, and combined all adjusted study-specific effect estimates using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 399 children were classified as having ADHD, with a prevalence ranging from 2.3% to 7.3% in the studies. Early life exposure to PFOS or PFOA was not associated with ADHD during childhood [odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 0.96 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.06) to 1.02 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.11)]. Results from stratified models suggest potential differential effects of PFAS related to child sex and maternal education. CONCLUSION: We did not identify an increased prevalence of ADHD in association with early life exposure to PFOS and PFOA. However, stratified analyses suggest that there may be an increased prevalence of ADHD in association with PFAS exposure in girls, in children from nulliparous women, and in children from low-educated mothers, all of which warrant further exploration. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5444. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

abstract={Folate deficiency in the critical developmental period has been repeatedly associated with an increased risk of Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but the key pathophysiological mechanism has not yet been identified. In this work, we focused on identifying genes whose defect has similar consequences to folate depletion in the metabolic network. Within the Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) framework, we developed a method of blocked metabolites that allowed us to define the metabolic consequences of various gene defects and folate depletion. We identified six genes (GART, PFAS, PPAT, PAICS, ATIC, and ADSL) whose blocking results in nearly the same effect in the metabolic network as folate depletion. All of these genes form the purine biosynthetic pathway. We found that, just like folate depletion, the blockade of any of the six genes mentioned above results in a blockage of purine metabolism. We hypothesize that this can lead to decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and subsequently, an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) pool in neurons in the case of rapid cell division. Based on our results, we consider the methylation defect to be a potential cause of ASD, due to the depletion of purine, and consequently S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), biosynthesis. © 2020 by the authors.

All soft-bridged iminopyridyl ligands and metal complexes were fully characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, UV–Vis, ESI-MS, and ICP-MS. Upon activation with methylaluminoxane (MAO), these metal complexes exhibited moderate catalytic activity up to the range of 105 g/(mol Me h) for ethylene oligomerization, and butene was the major product, while for the cobalt complexes, activation with EtAlCl2 in toluene produced Friedel–Crafts toluene alkylation products. In the catalytic systems, cobalt complexes exhibited better catalytic activity and selectivity towards higher carbon number olefins (≥C8) than their iron analogues. The correlations between metal complexes and their catalytic activities and product distribution were investigated in detail under various reaction parameters such as reaction temperature, ethylene pressure and amount of co-catalyst. Under optimized conditions ([Co] = 7 μmol, 35°C, 1.0 MPa, MAO-to-Co = 500), soft-bridged iminopyridyl cobalt catalyst Co1 led to catalytic activity of 6.18 × 105 g/(mol Co h) and 29.97% selectivity for higher carbon number olefins. However, under optimized conditions ([Fe] = 7 μmol, 25°C, 1.0 MPa, MAO-to-Fe = 500), soft-bridged iminopyridyl iron catalyst Fe1 led to catalytic activity of 4.73 × 105 g/(mol Fe h) and 22.60% selectivity for higher carbon number olefins. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract={Introduction: Phlebitis is a common complication associated with the use of peripheral intravenous catheters. The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of phlebitis with peripheral intravenous catheter use and to identify risk factors for phlebitis development. Method: Literature survey was conducted in electronic databases (CINAHL, Embase, Google Scholar, Ovid, and PubMed), and studies were included if they used peripheral intravenous catheter for therapeutic or volumetric infusion and reported phlebitis incidence rates. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to obtain overall and subgroup phlebitis incidence rates and odds ratio between males and females in phlebitis incidence. Results: Thirty-five studies were included (20,697 catheters used for 15,791 patients; age 57.1 years (95% confidence interval: 55.0, 59.2); 53.9% males (95% confidence interval: 42.3, 65.5)). Incidence of phlebitis was 30.7 per 100 catheters (95% confidence interval: 27.2, 34.2). Incidence of severe phlebitis was 3.6% (95% confidence interval: 2.7%, 4.6%). Incidence of phlebitis was higher in non-intervened (30% (95% confidence interval: 27%, 33%)) than in intervened (21% (95% confidence interval: 15%, 27%)) groups, and with Teflon (33% (95% confidence interval: 25%, 41%)) than Vialon (27% (95% confidence interval: 21%, 32%)) cannula use. Odds of developing phlebitis was significantly higher in females (odds ratio = 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.93); p = 0.02). Longer dwelling time, antibiotics infusion, female gender, forearm insertion, infectious disease, and Teflon catheter are important risk factors for phlebitis development identified by the included studies. Conclusion: Incidence of phlebitis with the use of peripheral intravenous catheters during infusion is 31%. Severe phlebitis develops in 4% of all patients. Risk of phlebitis development can be reduced by adapting appropriate interventions. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Currently, cobalt and zeolites are used in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) to produce gasoline-range hydrocarbons (GRHs) that constitute clean and environmentally friendly fuels. This technology has earned a great deal of attention from researchers across the world, as it provides a substitute for fuel derived from fossil crudes, which have hitherto been the sole source of the petrol and diesel required by the industry. However, owing to the depletion of the earth's oil and coal reserves and the unfavourable environmental impact of conventional fuel production, an alternative source of fuel is needed. This article provides a critical review of the technological challenges involved in producing middle isoparaffins and olefins (gasoline hydrocarbons) by FTS. These involve combining cobalt-based catalysts and zeolites to form hybrid catalysts. In this review, we address most of these by setting out each method of creating cobalt and zeolite hybrid catalysts in turn, so that researchers can identify which applications are most effective for producing GRHs. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={Advanced reduction processes (ARPs) have emerged as a promising method for destruction of persistent per- A nd polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in water due to the generation of short-lived and highly reductive hydrated electrons (eaq -). This study provides a critical review on the mechanisms and performance of reductive destruction of PFAS with eaq -. Unique properties of eaq - and its generation in different ARP systems, particularly UV/sulfite and UV/iodide, are overviewed. Different degradation mechanisms of PFAS chemicals, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and others (e.g., short chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs), per- A nd polyfluoro dicarboxylic acids, and fluorotelomer carboxylic acids), are reviewed, discussed, and compared. The degradation pathways of these PFAS chemicals rely heavily upon their head groups. For specific PFAS types, fluoroalkyl chain lengths may also affect their reductive degradation patterns. Degradation and defluorination efficiencies of PFAS are considerably influenced by solution chemistry parameters and operating factors, such as pH, dose of chemical solute (i.e., sulfite or iodide) for eaq - photoproduction, dissolved oxygen, humic acid, nitrate, and temperature. Furthermore, implications of the state-of-the-art knowledge on practical PFAS control actions in water industries are discussed and the priority research needs are identified.

abstract={The investigation of estrogen actions and their interaction characteristics with estrogen receptors (ERs) to induce unique functional features inside cells have allowed us to understand better the regulation of many vital physiological and cellular processes in humans. The biological effects of estrogenic ligands or compounds are mediated via estrogen receptors that act as the ligand-activated transcription factors. Therefore, the study on ligand-ER interaction properties and mechanism of ligand-ER complexes binding to specific estrogen response elements located in the promoters of target genes are very critical to realize the complicated biological process regulated by the endogenous estrogens. Several reviews have provided comprehensive and updated information on the influence of estrogen receptors in health and disease. However, the mechanism of estrogen–ERs binding and affinity aspects at molecular level is relatively under-investigated. This review thus aims to shed light on the significance of the binding kinetics of ligand-ER interactions because the information provide great assistance to define how a ligand or a drug can communicate with physiology to produce a desired therapeutic response. In addition, the most frequently used methodologies for the binding kinetic study are highlighted over the last decade. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the most common chronic metabolic disease in children and adolescents. The etiology of T1D is not fully understood but it seems multifactorial. The genetic background determines the predisposition to develop T1D, while the autoimmune process against β-cells seems to be also determined by environmental triggers, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Environmental EDCs may act throughout different temporal windows as single chemical agent or as chemical mixtures. They could affect the development and the function of the immune system or of the β-cells function, promoting autoimmunity and increasing the susceptibility to autoimmune attack. Human studies evaluating the potential role of exposure to EDCs on the pathogenesis of T1D are few and demonstrated contradictory results. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize experimental and epidemiological studies on the potential role of exposure to EDCs in the development of T1D. We highlight what we know by animals about EDCs’ effects on mechanisms leading to T1D development and progression. Studies evaluating the EDC levels in patients with T1D were also reported. Moreover, we discussed why further studies are needed and how they should be designed to better understand the causal mechanisms and the next prevention interventions. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods: For this comprehensive review, a PubMed and Google Scholar (January 1995-October 2018) search was conducted by the researchers, using the such as OCT, artifacts, artefact, and macula. Results: We reviewed the main OCT artifacts including software break-down or misidentification of retinal layers, incomplete segmentation error, complete segmentation failure, mirror artifact (inverted artifact), cut edge artifact, degraded image scan, out-of-register artifact, off-center artifact, motion artifact, foveal duplication, segmentation shift, blink artifact, static or fixed image artifact, linear artifact, and perfluorocarbon liquid-producing artifact. Conclusions: There are various artifacts in OCT image scans. The identification of these artifacts may help in accurate interpretations of OCT images in clinical settings that can affect the diagnosis and management of different retinal disorders. © 2020 Journal of Current Ophthalmology | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.},

abstract={Objectives: Nutrient sensing by hypothalamic neurons is critical for the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. We aimed to identify long- and medium-chain fatty acid species transported into the brain, their effects on energy balance, and the mechanisms by which they regulate activity of hypothalamic neurons. Methods: Simultaneous blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling was undertaken in rats and metabolic analyses using radiolabeled fatty acid tracers were performed on mice. Electrophysiological recording techniques were used to investigate signaling mechanisms underlying fatty acid-induced changes in activity of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. Results: Medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) octanoic acid (C8:0), unlike long-chain fatty acids, was rapidly transported into the hypothalamus of mice and almost exclusively oxidized, causing rapid, transient reductions in food intake and increased energy expenditure. Octanoic acid differentially regulates the excitability of POMC neurons, activating these neurons directly via GPR40 and inducing inhibition via an indirect non-synaptic, purine, and adenosine receptor-dependent mechanism. Conclusions: MCFA octanoic acid is a central signaling nutrient that targets POMC neurons via distinct direct and indirect signal transduction pathways to instigate changes in energy status. These results could explain the beneficial health effects that accompany MCFA consumption. © 2020 The Authors},

High-throughput nontargeted metabolomics methods for comprehensive assessment were selected to study changes in metabolic characteristics in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves by exposure to different concentrations of PFOS throughout the growth period (30 days). All the metabolites were analyzed by PCA and OPLS-DA methods, by the cutoff of VIP and p-value, 53 biomarkers were found and significantly regulated, all amino acids except glutamate were inhibited and probably associated with binding to protein, auxin and cytokinin of phytohormones were significantly down-regulated. In response mechanism to oxidative stress from PFOS, the phenylpropanoid pathway were fully activated to form several polyphenols and further enhanced into several flavonoids against the reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the primary defend pathway, in addition, ascorbate, trehalose and nicotinamide also were activated and help decrease the damage from oxidative stress. These results provide insights into the mechanism underlying the phytotoxicity of PFOS. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a wide group of environmentally persistent organic compounds of industrial origin, which are of great concern due to their harmful impact on human health and ecosystems. Amongst long-chain PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) are the most detected in the aquatic environment, even though their use has been limited by recent regulations. Recently, more attention has been posed on the short-chain compounds, due to their use as an alternative to long-chain ones, and to their high mobility in the water bodies. Therefore, short-chain PFAS have been increasingly detected in the environmental compartments. The main process investigated and implemented for PFAS removal is adsorption. However, to date, most adsorption studies have focused on synthetic water. The main objective of this article is to provide a critical review of the recent peer-reviewed studies on the removal of long- and short-chain PFAS by adsorption. Specific objectives are to review 1) the performance of different adsorbents for both long- and short-chain PFAS, 2) the effect of organic matter, and 3) the adsorbent regeneration techniques. Strong anion-exchange resins seem to better remove both long- and short-chain PFAS. However, the adsorption capacity of short-chain PFAS is lower than that observed for long-chain PFAS. Therefore, short-chain PFAS removal is more challenging. Furthermore, the effect of organic matter on PFAS adsorption in water or wastewater under real environmental conditions is overlooked. In most studies high PFAS levels have been often investigated without organic matter presence. The rapid breakthrough of PFAS is also a limiting factor and the regeneration of PFAS exhausted adsorbents is very challenging and needs more research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have recently drawn great attention due to their ubiquitous presence in aquatic environments and potential toxicity to human health and the environment. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that “passive” removal approaches, such as adsorption, filtration, and reverse osmosis or “active” degradation technologies, such as enhanced photolysis, electrochemical oxidation, and sonochemical destruction, are all able to individually conduct remedial measures for PFAS contamination at some level. However, drawbacks, specifically high energy consumption, low cost-efficiency, and extreme operating conditions, are commonly observed from these studies which significantly suppress the future for commercialization of these innovative technologies. Since 2015, a new trend of PFAS remediation has emerged that uses multiple synergetic technologies simultaneously (known as treatment train processes) to effectively achieve in-situ remediation of PFAS. This paper provides new insight of the recently reported treatment train studies selected from approximately 150 different publications with regards to the remediation of PFAS and discusses their innovative designs, remediation performances, present limits, and possible improvements. Based on a comprehensive review of the current treatment train studies, this review work proposes a new design that consists of three individual technologies, namely, nanofiltration, electrochemical anodic oxidation, and electro-Fenton degradation, to maximize economic and environmental benefits of PFAS remedial measures. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP) is one of the most widely used organophosphate ester flame retardants. The presence of TDCPP in surface waters and aquatic organisms have been reported worldwide, yet the ecological risk of TDCPP on microalgae is rarely studied. We investigated the biotransformation of TDCPP and its toxicity on the microalga Scenedesmus obliquus using an untargeted metabolomics approach. Exposure to TDCPP resulted in a dose-response decrease of micoalgal biomass. In the presence of microalgae, TDCPP concentration in the media decreased by 25.3–40.6% after 5 days. TDCPP metabolites were identified in the media including hydrolysis and hydroxyl-substituted dechlorination products. A dose-response separation of metabolic profiles of microalgae was observed, with effect seen at the lowest concentration of 10 µg/L tested, which is slightly higher than environmentally relevant concentrations. Differentiated metabolites identified include 52 lipids and 6 polar metabolites. Analysis of altered lipid pathways suggests that microalgal cells reinforce thylakoid membranes (function to protect photosynthesis) by compromising the integrity of plasma membrane (function to protect cellular substances) and extraplastidial cellular membranes. Changes in the polar metabolites might indicate osmotic stress and improved NO signaling after TDCPP exposure. Consistent with perturbation of membrane lipids, further experiment confirmed that exposure to 10 mg/L TDCPP resulted in significant (p < 0.01) plasma membrane damage. This study indicates biotransformation and the membrane damage toxicity mechanism of TDCPP on S. obliquus, demonstrating the usefulness of metabolomics for the toxicity mechanism elucidation of emerging pollutants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

We conducted the systematic research to reveal the impact of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) (0.01–10 mg/L) on seed germination and seedling growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The results showed that PSNPs had no discernible effect on seed germination rate whereas significantly (p < 0.01) increased root elongation by 88.6 %–122.6 % when compared with the control. Similarly, remarkable increases in carbon, nitrogen contents, and plant biomass were also observed after exposure to PSNPs. Moreover, PSNPs could reduce the shoot to root biomass ratio (S:R ratio) of wheat seedlings. Furthermore, the imagings of a 3D laser confocal scanning microscopy (LCSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that PSNPs were taken up and subsequently down-top transported to shoot. The absorption and accumulation of four micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) in wheat were generally reduced in varying degrees. Notably, metabolomics analysis revealed that all PSNPs treatments altered the leaf metabolic profiles mainly by regulating energy metabolisms and amino acid metabolisms. These findings are expected to provide new insights into the effects of PSNPs on crop plants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Puberty is the process of physical changes between childhood and adulthood during which adolescents reach sexual maturity and become capable of reproduction. It is considered one of the main temporal windows of susceptibility for the influence of the endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). EDCs may act as single chemical agents or as chemical mixtures; they can be pubertal influencers, accelerating and anticipating the processing of maturation of secondary sexual characteristics. Moreover, recent studies have started to point out how exposure to EDCs during puberty may predispose to breast cancer later in life. In fact, the estrogen-mimicking endocrine disruptors (EEDs) may influence breast tissue development during puberty in two main ways: the first is the action on the proliferation of the breast stromal cells, the second concerns epigenetic mechanisms. The aim of this mini-review was to better highlight what is new and what is not completely known regarding the role of EDCs during puberty. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Objective: We aimed to determine whether certain morphometrical characteristics of PFO are associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents, using a meta-analytical approach. Methods: We performed a systematic review of electronic databases for studies that compared morphometric parameters of PFO assessed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in subjects with cryptogenic cerebrovascular accidents (Group 1) and control (Group 2). Data were extracted and pooled into a meta-analysis. Results: A total of 895 patients with PFO were reported (Group 1: 493, Group 2: 402). No difference was found in the PFO channel length (Group 1: 10.8 [8.6-12.9] mm vs. Group 2: 10.4 [9.1-11.7] mm), as well as in PFO height measured at rest (Group 1: 2.4 [1.5-3.3] mm vs. Group 2: 1.8 [1.4-2.2] mm). The PFO height measured during a Valsalva maneuver was larger in Group 1 (3.5 [2.8-4.1] mm) than in Group 2 (1.7 [1.2-2.2] mm). Also, the septal excursion distance was found to be larger in Group 1 (6.4 [5.1-7.8] mm) than in Group 2 (3.1 [1.8-4.4] mm). The risk of cerebrovascular accident was higher in patients with PFO and concomitant septal aneurysm (OR 4.00; 95% CI 2.63-6.09; p < 0.001) and with large right-to-left shunt PFO (OR 3.81; 95% CI 2.21-6.55; p < 0.001), no such relationship was found for the presence of a Eustachian valve or Chiari's network (OR 1.90; 95% CI 0.90-4.05; p = 0.094). Conclusions: The TEE may help in identifying PFO that are of high risk of cerebrovascular accident. Greater PFO height during a Valsalva maneuver, larger septal excursion distance, concomitant atrial septal aneurysm, and large right-to-left shunt are associated with stroke-related PFOs. © 2020 S.

HRM profiling and quantification of PFASs were performed for 397 maternal perinatal serum samples collected from 1959-1967 in the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS). We used Metabolome-Wide Association Studies (MWAS) and pathway enrichment analysis for metabolic associations with PFOS, its precursor EtFOSAA, and EtFOSAA-to-PFOS ratio. Distinct metabolic profiles were found with EtFOSAA and PFOS. Urea cycle metabolites such as arginine, lysine and creatine had opposite associations with EtFOSAA (negative) and PFOS (positive); whereas, carnitine shuttle metabolites were found to be exclusively and positively associated with PFOS indicating perturbation in fatty acid metabolism. These differential metabolic associations for precursor and end-product represent an important first step in identifying how PFASs alter the in utero environment and potentially leads to disease risk. © 2020},

The concept of “exposome” leads to an intellectual framework of measuring many exposures in humans, and the emerging metabolomics technology offers a means to read out both the biological activity and environmental impact in the same dataset. How to integrate exposome and metabolome in data analysis is still challenging. Here, we employ a hierarchical community network to investigate the global associations between the metabolome and mixed exposures including DDTs, PFASs and PCBs, in a women cohort with sera collected in California in the 1960s. Strikingly, this analysis revealed that the metabolite communities associated with the exposures were non-specific and shared among exposures. This suggests that a small number of metabolic phenotypes may account for the response to a large class of environmental chemicals. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a persistent environmental chemical whose biological effects are mediated by multiple mechanisms. Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiome may be directly impacted by and/or alter the fate and effects of environmental chemicals in the host. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether PFOS influences the gut microbiome and its metabolism, and the host metabolome. Four groups of male C57BL/6 J mice were fed a diet with or without 0.003 %, 0.006 %, or 0.012 % PFOS, respectively. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metabolomic, and molecular analyses were used to examine the gut microbiota of mice after dietary PFOS exposure. Dietary PFOS exposure caused a marked change in the gut microbiome compared to controls. Dietary PFOS also caused dose-dependent changes in hepatic metabolic pathways including those involved in lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, TCA cycle, glucose, and amino acid metabolism. Changes in the metabolome correlated with changes in genes that regulate these pathways. Integrative analyses also demonstrated a strong correlation between the alterations in microbiota composition and host metabolic profiles induced by PFOS. Further, using isolated mouse cecal contents, PFOS exposure directly affected the gut microbiota metabolism. Results from these studies demonstrate that the molecular and biochemical changes induced by PFOS are mediated in part by the gut microbiome, which alters gene expression and the host metabolome in mice. © 2020},

abstract={Anti-androgenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can cross the placenta to modify early offspring sexual dimorphic markers. These changes are linked to anogenital distance (AGD), which is an androgen-sensitive anthropometric parameter used as a biomarker of perineal growth and caudal migration of the genital tubercle. This review aimed to summarize strength of evidence for associations of in utero exposure to EDCs with AGD and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature so as to inform future research. We performed an electronic search of English literature in September 2019 in medical literature analysis and retrieval system online (MEDLINE), Web of Science and Toxline. We included epidemiological studies that examined in utero exposure to persistent and nonpersistent EDCs and considered AGD in offspring as an outcome. Our review contained 16 investigations examining exposure to persistent EDCs (nine studies) and nonpersistent EDCs (seven studies). Some individual studies reported an inverse association between exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), dioxins, perfluoroalkyl substances, and organochlorides and AGD in both male and female offspring. Meta-analysis of three studies found a small reduction of AGD in female offspring exposed to BPA. The number of studies per chemical is small, and number of subjects examined is limited; so, replication of these results is needed. To achieve more specificity and better replication of results, future studies should establish the association of nonpersistent EDCs using multiple urine samples, evaluate the cumulative impact of exposure to a mixture of anti-androgenic chemicals, and offer adequate consideration of more maternal- and children-related confounding factors. © 2019 The Author(s).

We conducted a literature review to assess effectiveness and safety of Teflon™ and Ivalon® sponges for treatment of TN with MVD. Methods: In January 2019, PubMed was searched for manuscripts published in English using permutations of “Microvascular decompression”, “Teflon”, “Ivalon”, “Granuloma”, “Polytetrafluoroethylene”, “Trigeminal Neuralgia”, and “Exploration”. Success and relapse rates, causes of relapse, and complication rates were analyzed. We analyzed for relationships with ANCOVA at an alpha threshold of.05. Results: Thirty-six studies representing 4273 patients fit inclusion criteria. Twenty-five dealt with initial MVD, 12 with re-do MVD. Initial MVD initial success rates were 85% in patients receiving Teflon™ (57–100%*) and 91% in patients receiving Ivalon® (79–100%*). Recurrence rates were 12% in Teflon™ patients (0*–30%) and 9.1% in Ivalon® patients (0*–19%). In patients with relapses, implants were the cause in 49% of Teflon™ patients (0*–100%*) and 50% of Ivalon® patients (0*–100%*). Complication rates for patients receiving Teflon™ were 12% (0*–34%) and 19% for patients receiving Ivalon® (0*–40%). Conclusion: Teflon™ and Ivalon® are two materials used in MVD for TN. It is an effective treatment with long-term symptom relief and recurrence rates of 1–5% each year. Ivalon® has been used less than Teflon™ though is associated with similar success rates and similar complication rates. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The pollution of the world's water resources is a growing issue which requires remediation. Surfactants used in many domestic and industrial applications are one of the emerging contaminants that require immediate attention. Treating water contaminated with surfactants using adsorption provides better performance when compared to other techniques. A variety of materials have been developed for adsorbing surfactants. Activated carbon is the most suitable adsorbent for removing surfactants but is expensive to synthesize and difficult to regenerate. Therefore, a variety of new adsorbents such as zeolites, nanomaterials, resins, biomaterials and clays have been developed as alternatives. The developed adsorbents are promising but considerable research is still required to develop highly efficient, economical, environment friendly and sustainable adsorbents to replace activated carbon. This paper critically reviews the characteristics of adsorbents, the performance of adsorbents, kinetics, isotherms and thermodynamics, mechanisms of adsorption, regeneration of adsorbents and future perspectives in the adsorption of surfactants. Developing novel adsorbents, testing adsorbents in real wastewaters and recycling the adsorbents are required in future studies in the removal of surfactants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Postnatal gestational age (GA) algorithms derived from newborn metabolic profiles have emerged as a novel method of acquiring population-level preterm birth estimates in low resource settings. To date, model development and validation have been carried out in North American settings. Validation outside of these settings is warranted. Methods: This was a retrospective database study using data from newborn screening programs in Canada, the Philippines and China. ELASTICNET machine learning models were developed to estimate GA in a cohort of infants from Canada using sex, birth weight and metabolomic markers from newborn heel prick blood samples. Final models were internally validated in an independent group of infants, and externally validated in cohorts of infants from the Philippines and China. Results: Cohorts included 39,666 infants from Canada, 82,909 from the Philippines and 4,448 from China. For the full model including sex, birth weight and metabolomic markers, GA estimates were within 5 days of ultrasound values in the Canadian internal validation (mean absolute error (MAE) 0.71, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.72), and within 6 days of ultrasound GA in both the Filipino (0.90 (0.90, 0.91)) and Chinese cohorts (0.89 (0.86, 0.92)). Despite the decreased accuracy in external settings, our models incorporating metabolomic markers performed better than the baseline model, which relied on sex and birth weight alone. In preterm and growth-restricted infants, the accuracy of metabolomic models was markedly higher than the baseline model. Conclusions: Accuracy of metabolic GA algorithms was attenuated when applied in external settings. Models including metabolomic markers demonstrated higher accuracy than models using sex and birth weight alone. As innovators look to take this work to scale, further investigation of modeling and data normalization techniques will be needed to improve robustness and generalizability of metabolomic GA estimates in low resource settings, where this could have the most clinical utility. © 2020 Hawken S et al.},

abstract={Background: Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant. Most people in developed countries have detectable serum concentrations. Lower birth weight has been associated with serum PFOS in studies world-wide, many of which have been published only recently. Methods: To facilitate a causal assessment of the birth weight and PFOS association, we updated previous meta-analyses of the association and employed a method that facilitated inclusion of all available data in one analysis. Our analysis was based on observations from 29 studies. Results: The random effects summary was -3.22 g/ng/ml (95% confidence interval [CI] = -5.11, -1.33). In a subgroup analysis stratified by when in pregnancy the PFOS concentration was measured, the summary for the early group was -1.35 (95% CI = -2.33, -0.37) and for the later group was -7.17 (95% CI = -10.93, -3.41). In a meta-regression model including a term for timing of blood draw, the intercept was slightly positive but essentially zero (0.59 g/ng/ml, 95% CI = -1.94, 3.11). In other words, the model indicated that when blood was drawn at the very beginning of pregnancy, there was essentially no relation of birth weight to PFOS. The results from the subgroup analyses differed from those from the model because the average gestational age at blood draw in the early group was 14 weeks, when bias would still be expected. A stronger inverse association in Asian studies was not completely explained by their blood draws being from later in pregnancy. Conclusions: The evidence was weakly or not supportive of a causal association. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) comprising monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against immune ‘checkpoints’, such as CTLA-4 and the PD1/PDL1 axis have dramatically improved clinical outcomes for patients with cancer. However, ICB by itself has failed to provide benefit in a wide range of solid tumors, where recurrence still occurs with high incidence. These poor response rates may be due to the therapeutic shortcomings of ICB; namely, a lack of cancer-specific cytotoxicity and ability to debulk tumors. To overcome these limitations, effective ICB therapy may require the combination with other complementary therapeutic platforms. Here, we propose that photothermal therapy (PTT) is an ideal therapeutic modality for combination with ICB because it can generate both tumor-specific cytotoxicity and immunogenicity. PTT elicits these specific effects because it is a localized thermal ablation technique that utilizes light-responsive nanoparticles activated by a wavelength-matched laser. While ICB immunotherapy alone improves cancer immunogenicity but does not generate robust antitumor cytotoxicity, nanoparticle-based PTT elicits targeted and controlled cytotoxicity but sub-optimal long-term immunogenicity. Thus, the two platforms offer complementary and potentially synergistic antitumor effects, which will be detailed in this review. We highlight three classes of nanoparticles used as agents of PTT (i.e., metallic inorganic nanoparticles, carbon-based nanoparticles and organic dyes), and illustrate the potential for nanoparticle-based PTT to potentiate the effects of ICB in preclinical models. Through this discussion, we aim to present PTT combined with ICB as a potent synergistic combination treatment for diverse cancer types currently refractory to ICB as well as PTT monotherapies. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most consumed pharmaceuticals worldwide due to their significant anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. These drugs are mainly excreted from the body in their metabolized form and may enter into the environment through different pathways. In wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), these contaminants are mainly removed by biological treatment processes. However, even after these treatments, high concentrations of these drugs have been found in WWTPs effluents, surface water, and drinking water. NSAIDs are likely to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms such as Mytilus galloprovincialis. Furthermore, toxic effects such as oxidative stress, developmental abnormalities, hepatotoxicity, immunosuppressive effects, and hematological alterations have been found in several freshwater species exposed to these pollutants. Therefore, NSAIDs are a threat to the human being as well as to our environment. This review comprehensively discusses the worldwide consumption of NSAIDs, their occurrence in the aquatic environments, and the toxic effects produced by these drugs in nontarget organisms. This is to raise awareness of the negative consequences of their occurrence in freshwater ecosystems and promote the creation of new alternatives for their removal from water. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Background: Anesthetic considerations are integral to the success of facial transplantation (FT), yet limited evidence exists to guide quality improvement. This study presents an institutional anesthesia protocol, defines reported anesthetic considerations, and provides a comprehensive update to inform future directions of the field. Methods: An institutional "FT Anesthesia Protocol"was developed and applied to 2 face transplants. A systematic review of 3 databases captured FTs in the peer-reviewed literature up to February 2020. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts to include all clinical articles with FT recipient and/or donor-specific preoperative, intraoperative, and relevant postoperative anesthetic variables. Data charting guided a narrative synthesis, and quantitative synthesis reported variables as median (range). Results: Our institutional experience emphasizes the importance of on-site rehearsals, anticipation of patient-specific anesthetic and resuscitative requirements, and long-term pain management. Systematic search identified 1092 unique records, and 129 met inclusion criteria. Reports of 37 FTs in the literature informed the following anesthetic axes: donor pre- and intraoperative management during facial allograft procurement, recipient perioperative care, immunotherapy, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and pain management. Quantitative synthesis of 30 articles showed a median operative time of 18 hours (range, 9-28) and fluid replacement with 13 L (5-18) of crystalloids, 13 units (0-66) of packed red blood cells, 10 units (0-63) of fresh frozen plasma, and 1 unit (0-9) of platelets. Conclusions: Anesthetic considerations in FT span the continuum of care. Future efforts should guide standard reporting to establish evidence-based strategies that promote quality improvement and patient safety. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={BACKGROUND: Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are found widespread in drinking water, foods, food packaging materials and other consumer products. Several PFAS have been identified as endocrine-disrupting chemicals based on their ability to interfere with normal reproductive function and hormonal signalling. Experimental models and epidemiologic studies suggest that PFAS exposures target the ovary and represent major risks for women's health. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: This review summarises human population and toxicological studies on the association between PFAS exposure and ovarian function. SEARCH METHODS: A comprehensive review was performed by searching PubMed. Search terms included an extensive list of PFAS and health terms ranging from general keywords (e.g. ovarian, reproductive, follicle, oocyte) to specific keywords (including menarche, menstrual cycle, menopause, primary ovarian insufficiency/premature ovarian failure, steroid hormones), based on the authors' knowledge of the topic and key terms. OUTCOMES: Clinical evidence demonstrates the presence of PFAS in follicular fluid and their ability to pass through the blood-follicle barrier. Although some studies found no evidence associating PFAS exposure with disruption in ovarian function, numerous epidemiologic studies, mostly with cross-sectional study designs, have identified associations of higher PFAS exposure with later menarche, irregular menstrual cycles, longer cycle length, earlier age of menopause and reduced levels of oestrogens and androgens. Adverse effects of PFAS on ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis have been confirmed in experimental models. Based on laboratory research findings, PFAS could diminish ovarian reserve and reduce endogenous hormone synthesis through activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, disrupting gap junction intercellular communication between oocyte and granulosa cells, inducing thyroid hormone deficiency, antagonising ovarian enzyme activities involved in ovarian steroidogenesis or inhibiting kisspeptin signalling in the hypothalamus. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The published literature supports associations between PFAS exposure and adverse reproductive outcomes; however, the evidence remains insufficient to infer a causal relationship between PFAS exposure and ovarian disorders. Thus, more research is warranted. PFAS are of significant concern because these chemicals are ubiquitous and persistent in the environment and in humans. Moreover, susceptible groups, such as foetuses and pregnant women, may be exposed to harmful combinations of chemicals that include PFAS. However, the role environmental exposures play in reproductive disorders has received little attention by the medical community. To better understand the potential risk of PFAS on human ovarian function, additional experimental studies using PFAS doses equivalent to the exposure levels found in the general human population and mixtures of compounds are required. Prospective investigations in human populations are also warranted to ensure the temporality of PFAS exposure and health endpoints and to minimise the possibility of reverse causality. © The Author(s) 2020.

abstract={Flammability standards for furniture, building insulation and electronics were established in an attempt to mitigate fire risk. However, research suggests that some of these flammability standards should be reconsidered. High levels of flame retardant chemicals, primarily organohalogens, are added to these products in order to comply with fire safety standards. Organohalogen and organophosphate flame retardants are associated with adverse health effects such as diminished immune function, endocrine disruption, and cancer. Further, flame retardants may not provide a significant fire safety benefit as used in many products, and these chemicals can hinder material recycling. We reviewed evidence of how flammability standards drive the continued use of harmful flame retardants and investigated cases in which flame retardants are used to achieve standard compliance without providing a significant fire safety benefit. The widespread continuous use of toxic flame retardant chemicals demonstrates that toxicological evidence and chemical-by-chemical regulation alone are not sufficient to prevent their inclusion in consumer products. However, recent experiences show that updated flammability standards can reduce the use of flame retardants while maintaining, or even increasing, fire safety. Additional opportunities exist for improved standards that could further decrease flame retardant use and maintain fire safety. © 2020 The Authors},

In the wake of current advances in nanotechnology, the drug delivery industry has seen a surge of nanoparticles advertising high specificity in target imaging. Given the rapid development of the field, this review has assembled related articles to explore whether molecular contrast agents can improve the diagnostic capability on gastrointestinal imaging, especially for IBD. Methods. Relevant articles published between 1998 and 2018 from a literature search of PubMed and EMBASE were reviewed. Data extraction was performed on the studies' characteristics, experimental animals, modelling methods, nanoparticles type, magnetic resonance methods, and means of quantitative analysis. Results. A total of 8 studies were identified wherein the subjects were animals, and all studies employed MR equipment. One group utilized a perfluorocarbon solution and the other 7 groups used either magnetic nanoparticles or gadolinium- (Gd-) related nanoparticles for molecular contrast. With ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles and Gd-related nanoparticles, signal enhancements were found in the mucosa or with focal lesion of IBD-related model in T1-weighted images (T1WI), whereas superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles showed a signal decrease in the intestinal wall of the model in T1WI or T2-weighted images. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was employed to analyze bowel intensity in 3 studies. And the percentage of normalized enhancement was used in 1 study for assessing the severity of inflammation. Conclusion. Molecular MRI with contrast agents can improve the early diagnosis of IBD and quantitate the severity of inflammation in experimental studies. © 2020 Yifan Luo et al.},

abstract={Objectives: The present systematic review focused on the prevention or treatment of three main types of pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFDs) specifically pelvic organ prolapse (POP), urinary incontinence (UI), and fecal incontinence (FI) using physiotherapy and pelvic floor muscle exercises (PFMEs). With regard to the breadth of the problem, there is not much evidence grounded on the best management. The main purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of physiotherapy and PFMEs on the prevention and treatment of pregnancy-related PFDs; namely, POP, FI, and UI. Therefore, this review incorporated studies comparing the use of physiotherapy and PFMEs with every other existing interventions. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on randomized-controlled-trial (RCT) articles and quasi-RCT designs through a search in the studies published with no time limits until December 2017 in the databases of PubMed (Medline), Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest. The meta-analysis was also applied for data synthesis. Moreover, heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran’s Q test and I2 index. Results: A total number of 26 RCTs were examined in this review in which the outcome variables were related to POP, UI, and FI prevalence; POP, UI, and FI severity, as well as pelvic floor muscle (PFM) strength and endurance. In most articles, UI prevalence or severity in intervention groups had significantly improved compared with those in controls. The number of studies examining POP and FI was also relatively low. In two studies, FI severity or prevalence in intervention groups had significantly enhanced in comparison with those in control groups; however, FI prevalence in two articles had been reported lower in intervention groups than that in control groups although no significant difference had been observed. There was also no significant improvement in intervention groups in two other studies in this respect. Besides, three articles had not reported traces of improvement in POP, as well as a significant difference between intervention and control groups. Nevertheless, two studies had found a significant improvement in POP in this regard. Based on meta-analysis results for the variable of PFM strength, Cochran’s Q test (P &lt; 0.001) and I2 index (90.02) indicated heterogeneity between studies; so, a random-effect meta-analysis was applied to estimate overall effect sizes. The overall mean differences following intervention between the study groups were also equal to 6.94, with a 95% CI (1.36 to 12.52). Conclusions: It was concluded that physiotherapy and PFMEs might have effects on pregnancy-related UI, but they had not consistently reduced FI severity or prevalence and failed to constantly improve POP. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={Purpose: Klebsiella pneumoniae producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) causes nosocomial infections worldwide. The present study aimed to determine the molecular subtyping characteristics and antibiotic resistance mechanisms of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains collected during an outbreak. Moreover, we attempted to reveal the fine transmission route of the strains within this outbreak using whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Methods: Collecting cases and strain information were carried out. Outbreak-related strains were identified using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The antibiotic susceptibility, drug-resistant genes, and molecular subtype characteristics of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae were analyzed. The fine transmission route of the strains within this outbreak was revealed using WGS and minimum core genome (MCG) sequence typing. Results: In mid-January, 2015, five cases of neonatal pneumonia caused by ESBLproducing K. pneumoniae were observed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the Affiliated Hospital of Chifeng University, China. Eight ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae were isolated from these five cases, and two additional strains from another two cases were identified using PFGE. All ten isolates harbored blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1, blaSHV-108, and blaOXA-1 genes, and belonged to the sequence type 471 (ST471) clone. A putative transmission map was constructed via comprehensive consideration of genomic and epidemiological information. WGS identified the initial case and the “superspreader”. The genomic epidemiological investigation revealed that the outbreak was caused by the introduction of the bacteria one month before the first case appeared. Conclusion: As far as we know, this is the first report to describe the characteristics of an ST471 ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae outbreak. The data showed that epidemiological inferences could be greatly improved by interpretation in the context of WGS and that K. pneumoniae strains isolated from the same outbreak contain sufficient genomic differences to refine epidemiological linkages on the basis of genetic lineage. These findings suggested that integration of genomic and epidemiological data can help us to have a clearer understanding of when and how outbreaks occur, so as to better control nosocomial transmission. © 2020 Wang et al.},

PFAS levels were previously determined in cord blood from a cohort of newborns recruited in Liege. METHOD: Parents of the children belonging to the first and the fifth quintiles of exposure to PFAS were contacted in order to measure the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in their child few months after birth. Twenty-eight children participated in the study. Moreover, we performed a literature review about associations between pre- or perinatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants and thyroid function during early childhood. RESULT: No significant difference was highlighted between both groups of contamination (Mann-Whitney, p-value = 0.91). Literature review highlighted the critical need of new longitudinal data about this problematic. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the PFAS levels at birth are not associated with TSH levels later in life. Large scale studies are required to confirm our results.Objectif : Notre but est d’étudier les associations potentielles entre contamination par les composés perfluorés (PFC) mesurée à la naissance et fonction thyroïdienne évaluée quelques mois plus tard. Les niveaux de PFC ont été déterminés précédemment dans le sang de cordon de nouveau-nés recrutés à Liège. Méthode : Les parents des enfants appartenant au premier et cinquième quintiles d’exposition aux PFC ont été contactés pour mesurer les niveaux de thyréostimuline (TSH) chez leurs enfants quelques mois après la naissance. Vingt-huit enfants ont été recrutés. De plus, nous avons réalisé une revue de littérature concernant les associations entre exposition pré- ou périnatale aux polluants organiques persistants (POP) et fonction thyroïdienne pendant la petite enfance. Résultat : Aucune différence significative n’a été mise en évidence entre les deux groupes de contamination (Mann-Whitney, p = 0,91). Selon, la revue de la littérature, il est indispensable de disposer de nouvelles données longitudinales relatives à la relation entre contamination par les POP et fonction thyroïdienne. Conclusion : Nos résultats suggèrent que les concentrations de PFC à la naissance ne sont pas associées aux niveaux de TSH au cours de la vie. Des études basées sur de plus grandes cohortes sont requises pour confirmer nos résultats.},

abstract={The gene expression omnibus (GEO) repository harbours an exponentially increasing number of gene expression studies. The expression data, as well as the related metadata, provides an abundant resource for knowledge discovery. Each study in GEO focuses on the gene expression perturbation of a specific subject (e.g., gene, drug, and disease). The identification of those subjects and the associations among them are beneficial for further in-depth studies. However, they cannot be directly inferred from the studies. A unified representation of those subjects (i.e., gene expression signatures) is desired. We developed GESgnExt for the automatic construction of gene expression signatures. The resultant 6542 signatures are built on 1934 series and 35 919 samples from GEO. To evaluate its significance, we calculated the similarities among those signatures and compared the discovered associations against the existing interaction databases. The signatures connect the genes, drugs, and diseases, covering most of the experimentally validated interactions. Besides, we have discovered 3307 novel signatures and their related associations, complementing the existing signature knowledge. The biomedical relevance of GESgnExt is demonstrated further in multiple case studies, providing mechanistic insights into its knowledge discovery process. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Objectives:To evaluate recent studies on available therapies for meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD).Methods:A literature search on recent publications, within the last five years, concerning treatment options for MGD was performed.Results:A total of 35 articles were reviewed after curation by the authors for relevance. In general, all modalities of treatments were shown to have clinical efficacy in alleviating dry eye signs and symptoms, although the extent of improvement and persistency of outcomes varied between the different treatments. Evidence from published studies demonstrate that thermal pulsation produces the longest lasting effect per treatment, but it also incurs the highest per-treatment cost. Reusable methods for warm compress with lipid/semi-fluorinated alkane-containing eye drops are recommended as first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate dry eye patients, because this option is most technically feasible and cost-effective in clinical practice. Intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy and thermal pulsation may be suitable as second line for patients unresponsive to warm compress therapy; however, their respective limitations need to be considered. For refractory MGD with features of periductal fibrosis or severe blepharitis, supplementary treatment with meibomian gland probing or oral antibiotics may be used.Conclusions:All eight forms of treatments, including self-applied eyelid warming, thermal pulsation, IPL, MG probing, antibiotics, lipid-containing eye drops, and perfluorohexyloctane, were effective against MGD, although with varying extent of clinical improvements. A better understanding on the mechanisms of actions may guide physicians to make better treatment decisions targeting the root causes.

abstract={The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guideline 305 for bioaccumulation testing in fish includes the option to conduct a dietary test for assessing a chemical's bioaccumulation behavior. However, the one-compartment toxicokinetic model that is used in the guidelines to analyze the results from dietary bioaccumulation tests is not consistent with the current state of the science, experimental practices, and information needs for bioaccumulation and risk assessment. The present study presents 1) a 2-compartment toxicokinetic modeling framework for describing the bioaccumulation of neutral hydrophobic organic chemicals in fish and 2) an associated toxicokinetic analysis tool (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion [ADME] B calculator) for the analysis and interpretation of dietary bioaccumulation test data from OECD-305 dietary tests. The model framework and ADME-B calculator are illustrated by analysis of fish dietary bioaccumulation test data for 238 substances representing different structural classes and susceptibilities to biotransformation. The ADME of the chemicals is determined from dietary bioaccumulation tests and bioconcentration factors, biomagnification factors, and somatic and intestinal biotransformation rates. The 2-compartment fish toxicokinetic model can account for the effect of the exposure pathway on bioaccumulation, which the one-compartment model cannot. This insight is important for applying a weight-of-evidence approach to bioaccumulation assessment where information from aqueous and dietary test endpoints can be integrated to improve the evaluation of a chemical's bioaccumulation potential.

abstract={Recently pharmaceuticals are emerging as a major source of pollution for the environment. It has been well observed that the effluent discharge from hospitals has an eminent quantity of chemical waste as antibiotics, disinfectants and other treatments wastes. Pharmaceutical effluents are bioactive and their existence in the environment has been found harmful to both aquatic life and humans. In developing countries, untreated wastewaters are discharged to local water bodies by just following the local regulations. The current global challenges including high population growth rate and climate change have contributed to the widespread epidemics and emergence of diseases. Besides intractable and decaying antibiotic system, hospitals emit pathogenic waste during treatment process that can lead to situations where a total ban on hospital effluent are needed, for instance in multiple cases where discharge lead to strain on nature and quality of water. In case of pharmaceutical residues, it has been observed that only 18–32% of the pharmaceutical residues could be degraded by the secondary treatment of these seven technologies and it has been increased to 30–65% by tertiary treatment. As far as the pharmaceutical residues are concerned, it has been observed that MBR removes the residues with the efficiency of 28–100%, varying for each pharmaceutical. This paper reviews the existing treatment processes, their advantages and future perspective of this emerging area. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Biochars are used globally in agricultural crop production and environmental remediation. However, environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs), which are stable emerging pollutants, are generated as a characteristic feature during biomass pyrolysis. EPFRs can induce the formation of reactive oxygen species, which poses huge agro-environmental and human health risks. Their half-lives and persistence in both biochar residues and in the atmosphere may lead to potentially adverse risks in the environment. This review highlights the comprehensive research into these bioreactive radicals, as well as the bottlenecks of biochar production leading up to the formation and persistence of EPFRs. Additionally, a way forward has been proposed, based on two main recommendations. A global joint initiative to create an all-encompassing regulations policy document that will improve both the technological and the quality control aspects of biochars to reduce EPFR generation at the production level. Furthermore, environmental impact and risk assessment studies should be conducted in the extensive applications of biochars in order to protect the environmental and human health. The highlighted key research directions proposed herein will shape the production, research, and adoption aspects of biochars, which will mitigate the considerable concerns raised on EPFRs. © 2019 The Authors},

The ecotoxicity and microbial resistance are considered to be major adverse environmental and health impact of pharmaceuticals even in trace amounts, which raise global concern. The recalcitrant nature of these pollutants restricts the application of the conventional treatment system for their remediation and triggers extensive research on the various advanced oxidation processes as a promising treatment system. Among them, visible-light-assisted semiconductor photocatalysis has significant potential as an efficient, low-cost, and green technology, which can use even solar energy as a clean and sustainable light source. A comprehensive review on the application of various visible light photocatalysts on the degradation of aqueous pharmaceutical pollutants was attempted to highlight their physiochemical properties, reaction mechanism, and catalytic activity in the laboratory- as well as field-scale operations. The challenges and gaps in the current literature have been identified, and recommendations for prospective research opportunities have been placed based on the findings.

abstract={Diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug has turned into a contaminant of emerging concern; hence, it was included in the previous Watch List of the EU Water Framework Directive. This review paper aims to highlight the metabolism of diclofenac at different trophic levels, its occurrence, ecological risks, and interactive effects in the water cycle and biota over the past two decades. Increased exposure to diclofenac not only raises health concerns for vultures, aquatic organisms, and higher plants but also causes serious threats to mammals. The ubiquitous nature of diclofenac in surface water (river, lake canal, estuary, and sea) is compared with drinking water, groundwater, and wastewater effluent in the environment. This comprehensive survey from previous studies suggests the fate of diclofenac in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and may predict its persistence in the environment. This review offers evidence of fragmentary available data for the water environment, soil, sediment, and biota worldwide and supports the need for further data to address the risks associated with the presence of diclofenac in the environment. Finally, we suggest that the presence of diclofenac and its metabolites in the environment may represent a high risk because of their synergistic interactions with existing contaminants, leading to the development of drug-resistant strains and the formation of newly emerging pollutants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Pharmaceuticals are a wide class of emerging pollutants due to their continuous and the increasing consumption of users. These pollutants are usually found in the real environment as mixtures alone or with metal ions. Thus, the migration risk increases, which complicates the removal of pharmaceuticals because of the combined and synergistic effects. The focus of treatment of pharmaceutical mixtures and their coexistence with metals is of considerable importance. For this purpose, adsorption has been efficiently applied to several studies for the treatment of such complex systems. In this article, the coadsorption behavior of pharmaceuticals in the absence and existence of metals on several adsorbents has been reviewed. The adsorption isotherms and kinetics of these two systems have been analyzed using different models and discussed. Important challenges and promising routes are suggested for the future development of the coadsorption of the studied systems. This article provides an overview on the most utilized and effective adsorbents, widely studied adsorbates, best applied isotherm and kinetic models, and competitive effect in coadsorption of pharmaceuticals, both with and without metals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of persistent and mobile fluoro-organic chemicals that have been detected in many water supplies, and their recommended safe concentrations in drinking water are as low as 6 ng/L. Current technological advances suggest that amine-containing sorbents can provide alternative solutions to PFAS control in the treatment of municipal water and wastewater at relatively low PFAS concentrations. The objective of this review is to provide critical analysis of the development and application of amine-containing sorbents for PFAS removal. The removal of PFAS by aminated sorbents relies on the combined effects of three main factors: (i) electrostatic interactions with functional groups of the sorbent, (ii) hydrophobic interactions with the sorbent and between PFAS molecules, and (iii) sorbent morphology. The design of next-generation sorbents should take into consideration these three factors and their relative contribution. We also provide an outlook and highlight of the key areas of innovative research needs to develop more efficient sorbents that will enable compliance with the increasingly stringent regulations of PFAS.

Antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) are a class of emerging pollutants that are difficult to remove once introduced. Understanding the environmental transfer of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) and ARGs is pivotal for creating control measures. In this review, we summarize the research progress on the spread and detection of ARB and ARG pollution related to animal husbandry. Molecular methods such as high-throughput sequencing have greatly enriched the information about ARB communities. However, it remains challenging to delineate mechanisms regarding ARG induction, transmission, and tempo-spatial changes in the whole process, from animal husbandry to multiple ecosystems. As a result, future research should be more focused on the mechanisms of ARG induction, transmission, and control. We also expect that future research will rely more heavily on metagenomic-analysis, metatranscriptomic sequencing, and multi-omics technologies. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Background: Patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) is relatively common, affecting 24% females and 11% males over the age of 55 years. Most patients can be treated conservatively. Arthroplasty remains the ultimate procedure for end stage PFOA. Debate continues as to whether total knee replacement (TKR) or patellofemoral replacement (PFR) is better for this group of patients. The aim of this article is to review the current evidence for use of these two procedures in this condition. Methods: Recent meta-analyses, systematic reviews and appropriate cohort publications concerning surgical management of PFOA were sourced. A cohort of patients from the authors' own institution was also reviewed. An instructional lecture was then created and delivered at the British Association for Surgery of the Knee 2019 annual conference, on behalf of the British Patellofemoral Society. This article has been written based on this lecture. Results: It is clear that PFOA is a different disease process than tibiofemoral osteoarthritis (TFOA). There is no doubt that PFR has a higher failure rate than TKR, but evidence suggests that outcomes and recovery may be better in the PFR group. This is complicated by subsets of those with PFOA faring better than others, the reasons for which are likely to be multifactorial. Conclusions: Both PFR and TKR may be used appropriately for PFOA. In keeping with a shared decision-making process, patients should be counselled appropriately preoperatively when deciding between these procedures. Further research is required to understand the differences in outcome between procedures and in subsets of patients with PFOA. © 2019},

We reviewed the mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluoroalkyl substances, phthalates, and environmental tobacco smoke in pervious based on birth cohort studies in Asia. The aim of this study was to summarize the traditional environmental pollution and the target subjects were also based on the birth cohort in Asia area. Environmental pollutants included air pollutants, pesticides focusing on organochlorine pesticides, diakylphosphates, and pyrethroid, and heavy metals including lead, arsenic, cadmium, manganese, vanadium, and thallium. Fetal growth and pregnancy outcomes, childhood growth and obesity, neurodevelopment and behavioral problems, and allergic disease and immune function were classified to elucidate the children's health effects. In total, 106 studies were selected in this study. The evidences showed air pollution or pesticides may affect growth during infancy or childhood, and associated with neurodevelopmental or behavioral problems. Prenatal exposure to lead or manganese was associated with neurodevelopmental or behavioral problems, while exposure to arsenic or cadmium may influence fetal growth. In addition to the harmonization and international collaboration of birth cohorts in Asia; however, understand the whole picture of exposure scenario and consider more discipline in the research are necessary. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

Big efforts are continuously made to monitor their levels and identify safe thresholds. For this purpose, an essential step is to prioritize harmful substances and understand their effect on human body. Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) deserve particular attention because of their wide diffusion and potential correlation with different diseases including glucose intolerance, hyperlipidaemia, thyroid diseases, gestational diabetes mellitus and hypertension, testicular and genitourinary cancer as well as impaired kidney function. This review focuses on the renal effects of PFCs, with the attempt to clarify their occurrence and pathogenetic mechanisms.Recent findingsWe reviewed MEDLINE and EMBASE citations between 31 October 2017 and 31 May 2019 and selected human studies measuring PFCs exposure, kidney function markers and the ability of haemodialysis to remove PFCs from the circulating blood. It has been currently clarified that exposure to PFCs is linked with an impaired kidney function and that they can be removed by blood purification.SummaryFurther studies are required on the potential synergic negative effect of PFCs co-exposure with other pollutants as well as animal studies about the removal capacity of different haemodialysis membranes.

In particular, odd-chain carboxylic acids (OCCAs) such as valerate (C5) and heptanoate (C7), were produced at relatively high concentrations upon propionate supplementation. Using a statistical experimental design method, the optimal culture medium was established for the selective production of OCCAs among the total produced acids. In a medium containing 2.42 g L−1 sodium acetate and 18.91 g L−1 sodium propionate, M. hexanoica produced 9.48 g L−1 valerate, 2.48 g L−1 heptanoate, and 0.12 g L−1 caproate. To clarify the metabolism of the exogenous added propionate for OCCAs production, 13C tracer experiments were performed by supplementing the culture broth with [1,2,3-13C3] propionate. The metabolites analysis based on mass spectrometry showed that the propionate was only used to produce valerate and heptanoate without being participated in other metabolic pathways. Furthermore, the carbon elongation pathway in M. hexanoica was explained by the finding that the incorporation of propionate and acetate in the produced valerate occurred in only one orientation. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have gained increasingly global attention in recent years. Due to their unique amphiphilic properties and stability, PFASs are recognized as highly persistent, toxic, and environmentally bioaccumulative. Among several physicochemical technologies, adsorption has been extensively used and proved to be an effective method for removing PFASs from aqueous environment. In this review article, the technical feasibility of the use of different adsorbents, such as activated carbon, ion exchange resins, minerals, molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and a wide range of potentially low-cost biosorbents, for PFASs removal from water or wastewater is critically reviewed. The evaluation and comparison of their PFASs sorption behavior in terms of kinetics and isotherms is presented. The mechanisms involved in PFASs adsorption processes, such as diffusion, electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interaction, ion exchange and hydrogen bond, are discussed. The effects of the parameters variability on sorption process are highlighted. Based on the literature reviewed, a few recommendations for future research on PFASs adsorption are also elaborated. Capsule: The adsorption behavior and mechanisms of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) on various adsorbents are reviewed. © 2019},

abstract={Introduction and hypothesis: Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), including urinary incontinence (UI), faecal incontinence (FI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP), are common debilitating conditions globally, with considerable variation of prevalence reported in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). It was hypothesised that the variation could be due to both random and non-random errors. The aim was to determine the pooled prevalence estimates of PFDs among community-dwelling women in LMICs and to examine possible reasons for the variations of prevalence reported. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Maternity & Infant Care was conducted to retrieve eligible studies. A meta-analysis with a random effects model and a meta-regression were performed. The manuscript was structured using the PRISMA checklist. Results: A total of 49 studies were included. The overall pooled prevalence of PFDs in LMICs was 25% (95% CI 22–29%). The pooled prevalence of UI, FI and POP was 30% (95% CI 25–35%), 8% (95% CI 4–11%) and 15% (95% CI 10–20%), respectively. A significant difference in the prevalence of UI was found between studies conducted in low and lower middle-income and upper middle-income countries and for FI between studies that used validated and non-validated questionnaires. Other methodological features did not show any effect on the variation of prevalence estimates of UI, FI and POP. Conclusions: PFDs affect a substantial proportion of women in LMICs. Since methodological heterogeneity was unexplained, this review suggests the need for large nationally representative population-based surveys to provide reliable estimates of the prevalence of PFDs in LMICs. © 2019, The International Urogynecological Association.},

abstract={The production and widespread use of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) has led to their presence in the environment, wildlife, and the human body. PFAS exposure has been indicated that could adversely affect human health. PFASs trigger chemical signals to cells, which further emit new signals to tissues and even to organs, and finally cause diseases. Detection of these signals and understanding of the meaning behind them are great challenges, which may be tackled through high-throughput ‘omics’ technologies, including transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. This review summarizes the analytical methodologies, such as sequencing, microarray, mass spectrometry (MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), used in these ‘omics’ technologies and therefore applied in the bioanalysis of PFAS-related health risks. We provide a summary of the important roles that analytic methodologies have played in the study of human health. We also focus on new analytical technologies that will certainly shed light on new health-related fields. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Despite the advantages, challenges still exist and are associated with the calibration and implementation of passive sampling, in particular for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) due to their unique physicochemical properties. In the current review, we focus on the calibration and use of passive samplers for PFASs in air and water. The comparison of the sampling rates generally showed a higher variability for the aqueous passive samplers compared to the passive air samplers. A better standardization for calibration methods for PFASs in air and water is needed. Nevertheless, passive samplers are an ideal tool for monitoring PFASs in air and water and can identify spatial or temporal trends and pollution sources, variations in water quality and ultimately improve our understanding of the global distribution of PFASs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Several analytical approaches have been developed for the determination of emerging pollutants (EPs), including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in environmental matrices. This paper reviews the sample preparation and instrumental methods proposed in the last few years (2012–2018) to assess PPCPs in sewage sludge. Three main steps are examined: extraction, clean-up and analysis. Sample preparation is critical as target compounds are normally found at low concentrations in complex matrices. Most procedures include sewage sludge pretreatment mostly through ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) although other novel techniques such as QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) or MSPD (matrix solid-phase dispersion) have been also employed. In one report, no differences in extraction efficiency were detected among the most commonly used extraction techniques such as ultrasound, microwave and pressurized liquid. Clean-up usually involves a conventional method such as solid phase extraction (SPE). This step is needed to appreciably reduce matrix suppression, and is followed by an instrumental analysis using techniques of preference such as gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC), mostly coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). A fully automated on-line system that includes extraction, chromatographic separation, and mass spectrometry in one-stage is here presented as a novel way of determining PPCPs in sewage sludge. This review also discusses the advantages and limitations of the different techniques used. Miniaturizing analytical techniques and the use of novel solid and liquid phase materials are emerging as efficient options that fulfill the principles of so-called "green chemistry". © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Steroidal estrogens are widespread water contaminants with potential carcinogenic and endocrine-disrupting activities. The World Health Organization has listed estrogens as group 1 carcinogens. These contaminants are of substantial concern because of potential threats to human health, and aquatic organisms on long-term exposure. A range of methods, including oxidation, adsorption, electrochemical, and irradiation techniques have been employed for their remediation from aqueous systems. However, inadequate removal, toxic sludge generation, high operating costs, and the requisite for skilled operating and maintenance personnel commercially hampered the application of many methods. An interesting alternative treatment approach based on the use of oxidoreductases, particularly laccases, has recently gained amicability for the biotransformation of emerging pollutants. The use of immobilized enzymes is more cost-effective from an industrial perspective due to improved catalytic stability, reusability, reduction of product inhibition, and easier product separation. This review provides comprehensive knowledge on the use of laccases in the biodegradation of steroidal estrogens, including estrone, 17β-estradiol, and 17α-ethinylestradiol with endocrine-disrupting potency from the environment. After an overview of estrogens and catalytic properties of laccase, the use of free, as well as immobilized laccases with a particular emphasis on estrogens removal by laccase-based fed-batch, packed bed bioreactors, and membrane reactors, is discussed. A comparison of existing treatment technologies with enzyme technology for the removal of estrogens from different environmental matrices is made. Lastly, along with concluding remarks, future research direction aimed at bridging knowledge gaps for estrogenic compounds removal are also proposed in this very important research area. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic gene regulatory mechanism; disruption of this process during early embryonic development can have major consequences on both fetal and placental development. The periconceptional period and intrauterine life are crucial for determining long-term susceptibility to diseases. Treatments and procedures in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and adverse in-utero environments may modify the methylation levels of genomic imprinting regions, including insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)/H19, mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST), and paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10), affecting the development of the fetus. ART, maternal psychological stress, and gestational exposures to chemicals are common stressors suspected to alter global epigenetic patterns including imprinted genes. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Our objective is to highlight the effect of conception mode and maternal psychological stress on fetal development. Specifically, we monitor fetal programming, regulation of imprinted genes, fetal growth, and long-term disease risk, using the imprinted genes IGF2/H19, MEST, and PEG10 as examples. The possible role of environmental chemicals in genomic imprinting is also discussed. SEARCH METHODS: A PubMed search of articles published mostly from 2005 to 2019 was conducted using search terms IGF2/H19, MEST, PEG10, imprinted genes, DNA methylation, gene expression, and imprinting disorders (IDs). Studies focusing on maternal prenatal stress, psychological well-being, environmental chemicals, ART, and placental/fetal development were evaluated and included in this review. OUTCOMES: IGF2/H19, MEST, and PEG10 imprinted genes have a broad developmental effect on fetal growth and birth weight variation. Their disruption is linked to pregnancy complications, metabolic disorders, cognitive impairment, and cancer. Adverse early environment has a major impact on the developing fetus, affecting mostly growth, the structure, and subsequent function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and neurodevelopment. Extensive evidence suggests that the gestational environment has an impact on epigenetic patterns including imprinting, which can lead to adverse long-term outcomes in the offspring. Environmental stressors such as maternal prenatal psychological stress have been found to associate with altered DNA methylation patterns in placenta and to affect fetal development. Studies conducted during the past decades have suggested that ART pregnancies are at a higher risk for a number of complications such as birth defects and IDs. ART procedures involve multiple steps that are conducted during critical windows for imprinting establishment and maintenance, necessitating long-term evaluation of children conceived through ART. Exposure to environmental chemicals can affect placental imprinting and fetal growth both in humans and in experimental animals. Therefore, their role in imprinting should be better elucidated, considering the ubiquitous exposure to these chemicals. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Dysregulation of imprinted genes is a plausible mechanism linking stressors such as maternal psychological stress, conception using ART, and chemical exposures with fetal growth. It is expected that a greater understanding of the role of imprinted genes and their regulation in fetal development will provide insights for clinical prevention and management of growth and IDs. In a broader context, evidence connecting impaired imprinted gene function to common diseases such as cancer is increasing. This implies early regulation of imprinting may enable control of long-term human health, reducing the burden of disease in the population in years to come. © 2019 The Author(s)..

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a diverse group of fluorinated organic chemicals that have been used in industrial and consumer applications since the 1950s. PFAS are resistant to chemical and biological degradation and are ubiquitous in the environment, including in water, sediment, and biota in the Laurentian Great Lakes. This critical review evaluates the spatial and temporal variability of commonly studied perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) in the Great Lakes by synthesizing data collected in water, surface sediment, sediment cores, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and herring gull (Larus argentatus) eggs. The lowest PFAS concentrations in all matrices are detected in Lake Superior, which is located in the most pristine region of the Great Lakes Basin. In contrast, higher concentrations are observed in Lakes Erie and Ontario, which are more impacted by industrial activity and wastewater discharge. The distribution of individual PFAS compounds also varies across the lakes in response to changes in PFAS sources, with higher proportions of PFSAs in the eastern lakes. Sediment and biota are enriched in long chain PFSAs and PFCAs relative to concentrations in the water column, as expected based on predicted partitioning behavior. Sediment cores and bioarchives consistently demonstrate that PFAS concentrations increased in the Great Lakes from the initial time points until the early 2000s. The available data indicate that PFOS and PFOA concentrations decline after this period in the upper Great Lakes, but are stable in Lake Ontario. However, these trends depend on the lake, the individual compound, and the organism considered. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

In Germany it is currently being examined whether and for whom these tests should be paid for by statutory health insurance in the future. Objective: (I) Diagnostic properties of NIPTs for the detection of trisomy 13, 18 and 21, and (II) hypothetical calculation of the possible use of NIPTs in different groups. Methods: (I) Systematic search for primary literature and systematic reviews in MEDLINE and four other databases. Inclusion criteria: Studies in pregnant women; index test: NIPT using molecular genetic analysis of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood to determine the trisomy risk; reference test: cytogenetic diagnostics or postnatal clinical examination. (II) Exploratory search. Hypothetical calculations for (1) all pregnant women following the current procedure without NIPTs using the example of first-trimester screening (FTS), (2) application in pregnant women with an increased risk (e.g., after preceding FTS), and (3) application of NIPT in a population with and without an increased trisomy risk. Results: In the 22 studies included, sensitivity and specificity for trisomy 21 detection were 99.13% (95% CI: [97.39%; 99.72%]) and 99.95% (95% CI: [99.88%; 99.98%]). The possible influence of test failures was not considered in the calculations, and thus the sensitivity or specificity of NIPTs may have been overestimated. For the detection of trisomy 13 and 18, the sensitivity could not be robustly estimated. Discussion: In pregnant women with an increased risk, NIPT can probably reduce the number of invasive tests and thus the number of test-related miscarriages. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Environmental exposure to arsenic, phthalate esters (PAEs) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) has been associated with human semen quality. However, the epidemiological “black-box” of these associations remains poorly uncovered. In this study, based on the association analysis between arsenic, PAE and PFC exposure and semen quality parameters (i.e., semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm count, progressive motility, total motility and normal morphology) in a Chinese male population, we explored the seminal plasma metabolic signatures that may mediate the exposure-outcome relations by using the meet-in-metabolite-analysis (MIMA) approach. As a result, a negative association was found between DMA and sperm concentration, whereas MEHP and PFHxS were positively associated with sperm count and concentration, respectively. Metabolomics analysis revealed that sixteen and twenty-two seminal plasma metabolites were related to sperm concentration and count, respectively, and they are mainly involved in fatty acid, lipid and amino acid metabolism. Moreover, it was further indicated that eicosatetraenoate, carnitines and DHA may impact the inverse association between DMA and sperm concentration, while eicosatetraenoate, carnitines, DHA, PGB2 and tocotrienol are possible mediators of the positive association between PFHxS and sperm concentration. As these metabolic biomarkers are relevant to antioxidation and fatty acid β-oxidation, we suggest that redox balance and energy generation shifts in seminal plasma are involved in the association of human semen quality with environmental DMA and PFHxS exposure. © 2019 The Authors},

The PPFR is perfectly stable at ambient conditions, but at temperatures above 80 °C undergoes β-scission to generate trifluoromethyl radical. This property can be used to initiate various chain-polymerization or trifluoromethylation reactions. The unique feature of this process, distinguishing it from all other known methods for ·CF3-radical generation, is that the radical is produced under neutral, inert and additive-free conditions.

abstract={Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has become an indispensable tool for high-throughput analysis of macromolecules, but many challenges still remain in detection of small molecules due to the severe matrix-related background interference in the low-molecular-weight ranges (MW < 700 Da). Herein, a gallic acid (GA)-functionalized zirconium 1,4-dicarboxybenzene metal-organic framework (MOF) (denoted as UiO-66-GA) was designed to serve as a new substrate, and a novel strategy on the basis of the synergistic effect of MOF and GA was developed to enhance the LDI process. In comparison with conventional organic matrices, the UiO-66-GA substrate showed superior LDI performance in the analysis of a wide variety of molecules including amino acids, unsaturated fatty acids, bisphenols (BPs), oligosaccharides, peptides, protein, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) of various average molecular weights from 200 to 10000. Perfluorooctanoic sulfonate (PFOS) was used to evaluate the ability of quantitative analysis, and its corresponding limit of detection as low as 1 fmol was achieved. High sensitivity and good salt tolerance of the UiO-66-GA-assisted LDI-MS were allowed to determine ultratrace PFOS in the spiked human urine and serum samples. In addition, the synergistic mechanism of MOF and GA in the enhanced LDI process was investigated by comprehensively comparing GA-and its analogue-functionalized UiO-66, and the results revealed that two aspects contributed to the enhanced LDI process: (1) an enhancement in the metal-phenolic coordination system of UiO-66-GA promoted laser absorption and energy transfer; (2) introduction of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of GA onto UiO-66 facilitated the LDI process in both positive and negative ion modes. This work expands a new domain for the MOF applications and provides a promising alternative for various molecule analyses. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The authors regret an error in the published paper regarding the sampling procedure. The second paragraph of section 2.1 should read: “All samples were collected directly from Niskin bottles into 10 L polyethylene cubitainers. Samples were then filtered within 2 hours through 0.45 μm Millipore nitrocellulose acetate filters into acid-cleaned polyethylene cubitainers/bottles and acidified to pH ∼2 using distilled 12 M HCl in a general laboratory on board. All sample bottles were double-bagged and shipped to the home laboratory.” A number of observations demonstrate that our published Cd concentrations and isotope compositions, as well as the related discussion and interpretation, are not significantly affected by Cd contamination from the vessel, the sampling system or the initial sample handling. Firstly, the Cd concentration and isotope data for two profiles of our study show excellent agreement with results obtained for profiles from nearby stations of the GEOTRACES P16 section, which were collected with Teflon lined GO-FLO bottles and a trace metal clean sampling system (see detailed discussion in the last paragraph of section 3.2 in the original article). The most significant differences between the datasets are observed for shallow depths. In this case, however, our samples show lower Cd concentrations than samples from the nearby GEOTRACES P16 stations (Figure S2 in the original article). Secondly, Cd concentrations at St. 93 of cruise M77/4 in this study show good agreement between samples collected with Niskin bottles and those collected with GO-FLO bottles (unpublished data of Peter Croot and Kathrin Wuttig) deployed on a Kevlar line from the side of the ship (Wuttig et al., 2013) (Fig. 1). The collection and analysis procedures for these GO-FLO samples provided by Peter Croot and Kathrin Wuttig are briefly described here. Upon recovery, Teflon coated GO-FLO bottles (General Oceanics) with Teflon stop cocks were immediately brought into an over-pressurized ISO class 5 clean container. Seawater samples were filtered in-line through 0.2 μm filter cartridges (Sartorious Sartobran) under slight N2 overpressure into acid cleaned 1 L LDPE bottles (Nalgene) and acidified with sub-boiled quartz-distilled hydrochloric acid to pH 1.7. Cadmium concentrations of the GO-FLO samples were analyzed in a trace-metal clean laboratory at GEOMAR by graphite furnace atomic absorption (ETAAS, Perkin-Elmer Model 4100ZL) after Klinkhammer (1980). The handling of the samples collected with Niskin and GO-FLO samples on board therefore differed significantly, which includes using different rosette systems that were deployed at different times, the types and pore sizes of filters used for filtration and the bottles into which samples were filtered. Yet Cd concentrations agree well, particularly at shallow depths where Cd concentrations are at pmol/kg levels. A difference of ∼0.1 nmol/kg is observed between the two datasets at 200 m water depth, whereby the sample collected with the Niskin bottle shows a higher Cd concentration. This difference in Cd concentrations is within the natural variability of the Peruvian upwelling system and is also present between our Niskin bottle dataset and that of the nearby stations from the GEOTRACES P16 transect (Niskin samples in this case showing lower Cd concentrations; Figure S2 in the original article). This essentially excludes any significant artifacts originating from contamination of our samples. The authors apologize for any inconvenience caused. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) are receiving global attention due to their persistence in the environment through wastewater effluent discharges and past improper industrial waste disposal. They are resistant to biological degradation and if present in wastewater are discharged into the environment. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) issued drinking water Health Advisories for PFOA and PFOS at 70 ng/L each and for the sum of the two. The need for an enforceable primary drinking water regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) is currently being assessed. The USEPA faces stringent legal constraints and technical barriers to develop a primary drinking water regulation for PFOA and PFOS. This review synthesizes current knowledge providing a publicly available, comprehensive point of reference for researchers, water utilities, industry, and regulatory agencies to better understand and address cross-cutting issues associated with regulation of PFOA and PFOS contamination of drinking water. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Depletion of groundwater resources and continued decline in overall groundwater quality is a cause of concern because large human population around the world uses groundwater as a source of drinking water. This paper presents a comprehensive review of studies published in the year 2018 that documented issues of groundwater pollution, sources, and distribution reported from across the world due to anthropogenic, hydroclimatogical, and natural processes. Groundwater pollution due to organic contaminants focuses particularly on pesticides, herbicides, and contaminants of emerging concern. Pollution due to inorganic pollutants such as arsenic and other heavy metals is also reviewed with particular emphasis on regions that have reported a significantly higher incidence of these pollutants in groundwater. A compilation of various studies is also included in the review paper that showed increased incidences of waterborne illnesses due to fecal and microbial contamination due to poor sanitary practices. Reviews of groundwater contaminants such as fluoride and nitrate are included to provide readers a holistic understanding of groundwater pollution problem around the world. Practitioner points: Groundwater pollution issues during 2018 are reviewed and documented. Occurrence of organic and inorganic pollutants in groundwater is reported. Groundwater pollution vulnerability remains a critical issue. © 2019 Water Environment Federation},

abstract={In the past few decades, there has been a dramatic increase in scientific publications dealing with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and the escalating publication rate makes it close to impossible for individual researchers to get an overview of the field. Assuring the relevance and quality of the research conducted in any research field is a crucially important task. The rapidly increasing publication rates imply that review papers will play a progressively more central role to that end. The aim of the present paper is to critically assess whether reviews dealing with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are effective vehicles for a healthy dialogue about methodological weaknesses, uncertainties, research gaps and the future direction of the field. We carried out a tiered content-analysis of CEC review papers. Relevant papers were identified through searches in Web of Science (Clarivate), leading to the identification of 6391 original research papers of which 193 are review papers. We find that the majority of CEC reviews are written as if they are comprehensive, even though this clearly is not the case. A minority (~20%) take a critical-analytical approach to the reviewing task and identify weaknesses and research gaps. The following widespread tendencies in CEC research papers are commonly noted as concerning: to equate removal of CECs to ‘decreased concentrations in the effluent’; to focus on parent substances and not concern oneself with degradation products; to focus on most commonly studied substances rather than those of most concern; to not deal with the corollary of our inability to detect or assess the risk for all substances, and to give insufficient attention to uncertainties and the unknown. Several critical-analytical reviews are among the highest cited, which suggests that they have the potential to function as effective vehicles for a healthy dialogue on these topics. On the other hand, it would appear that the concerns expressed in these reviews have a limited impact, as the same concerns are repeated over time. This might be due to a tendency among review authors to express their concerns implicitly, instead of clearly spelling them out. Our study suggests that CEC reviews presently fail to provide adequate and reliable guidance regarding the relevance and quality of research in the field. We argue that the overwhelming number of publications in combination with a lack of quality criteria for review papers are reasons to this failure: it is well documented that choices made during the reviewing process have a major impact on the outcome of a review. These choices include: search engine; the criteria used to include or exclude papers; the criteria used to assess the quality of the data generated in the research papers included; the criteria used for the choice of substances/ organisms/ technologies reported on. The lack of transparent procedures makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to assess the quality of the findings presented or to put those findings in context. In this light, it is noteworthy that criteria for a good review paper are rarely spelled out by peer-reviewed journals or included in instructions on scientific writing. The dramatic increase in publications is a challenge for the entire research community, particularly for research fields that are expected to provide policy-relevant data. We argue that only when peer-reviewed journals start specifying quality criteria for review papers, can such papers be relied upon to provide adequate and strategic guidance on the development of CEC research. We anticipate that our findings and conclusions are valid for many other research fields. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are highly toxic organic chemicals. Lakes are one of the main sinks of POPs. POPs can be accumulated in multiple matrices in lake ecosystems and biomagnified through the food web, and thus pose a potential threat not only to lake ecosystems, but also to human health. Given their potential persistent risks, they have received much attention over the past decades. This review comprehensively summarizes the data on the levels and distributions of POPs in selected typical lake ecosystems in China and worldwide, involving water, sediments, organisms, and surrounding soils and atmosphere. It was found that current publications on POPs in Chinese lakes are mainly related to lakes in the developed eastern plain area, with only a few studies concerning the less-developed Qinghai-Tibet Plateau area. Similarly, around the world, there are more research on POPs in developed countries and less in relatively less-developed areas. Moreover, there are significant differences in the levels of POPs in different matrices in different lake ecosystems. Legacy POPs, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), were commonly detected and reported in different lakes, while emerging POPs like perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), and hexabromocyclododecane (HCBD) were relatively less detected or reported. A comprehensive summarization on the levels and distributions of traditional and emerging POPs in lake ecosystems could be significant for further understanding the behaviors and risks of POPs in lake ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Some success in identifying acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD) deficiencies before they are symptomatic has been achieved through tandem mass spectrometry. However, there has been several challenges that need to be confronted, including excess false positives, the occasional false negatives and indicators selection. To select ideal indicators and evaluate their performance for identifying ACAD deficiencies, data from 352,119 newborn babies, containing 20 cases, were used in this retrospective study. A total of three new ratios, C4/C5DC+C6-OH, C8/C14:1, and C14:1/C16-OH, were selected from 43 metabolites. Around 903 ratios derived from pairwise combinations of all metabolites via multivariate logistic regression analysis were used. In the current study, the regression analysis was performed to identify short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency, and very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency. In both model-building and testing data, the C4/C5DC+C6-OH, C8/C14:1 and C14:1/C16-OH were found to be better indicators for SCAD, MCAD and VLCAD deficiencies, respectively, compared to [C4, (C4, C4/C2)], [C8, (C6, C8, C8/C2, C4DC+C5-OH/C8:1)], and [C14:1, (C14:1, C14:1/C16, C14:1/C2)], respectively. In addition, 22 mutations, including 5 novel mutations and 17 reported mutations, in ACADS, ACADM, and ACADL genes were detected in 20 infants with ACAD deficiency by using high-thorough sequencing based on target capture. The pathogenic mutations of c.1031A > G in ACADS, c.449_452delCTGA in ACADM and c.1349G > A in ACADL were found to be hot spots in Suzhou patients with SCAD, MCAD, and VLCAD, respectively. In conclusion, we had identified three new ratios that could improve the performance for ACAD deficiencies compared to the used indicators. We considered to utilize C4/C5DC+C6-OH, C8/C14:1, and C14:1/C16-OH as primary indicators for SCAD, MCAD, and VLCAD deficiency, respectively, in further expanded newborn screening practice. In addition, the spectrum of mutations in Suzhou population enriches genetic data of Chinese patients with one of ACAD deficiencies. © Copyright © 2019 Wang, Zhang, Gao, Wang, Ma, Li and Wang.},

abstract={The prevalence of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in various environmental compartments is posing a serious health risks to all kinds of lives on the planet. The levels of OMPs such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, antibiotics, pesticides, contraceptive medicines, and personal care products in water bodies are increasing with each passing day. It is an urgent need of time to limit the release of OMPs into the environment, and to remove the prevailing OMPs for sustainable environmental management. The majority of the conventional means of water decontamination are either inefficient or expensive. However, due to nanosize, high surface area, and hollow and layered structure, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) serve as excellent sorbents for the removal of a diverse range of OMPs. The occurrence of emerging OMPs and their detrimental effects on human and animal health are collected and discussed in this review. The characteristics and efficacy of various CNTs (pristine and modified) for the efficient removal of different OMPs, and the removal mechanisms have been reviewed and discussed. The literature demonstrated that adsorption of OMPs onto CNTs is very complicated and rely on multiple factors including the properties of adsorbent and the adsorbate as well as solution chemistry. It was found that H–bonding, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, H-π bongs, and π-π interactions were the major mechanisms responsible for the adsorption of OMPs onto various kinds of CNTs. Despite of higher affinities for OMPs, hydrophobicity and higher costs restrain the practical application of CNTs for wastewater treatment on large scale. However, continuous production may lead to the development of cost-effective, efficient and eco-friendly CTNs technology for wastewater treatments in future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

They are also used for industrial purposes including in aqueous film forming foams for firefighting. PFAS are ubiquitous in the environment, are widely detected in human biomonitoring studies, and are of growing regulatory concern across federal, state, and local governments. Regulators, scientists, and citizens need to stay informed on the growing health and toxicology literature related to PFAS. Objectives: The goal of this systematic evidence map is to identify and organize the available health and toxicology related literature on a set of 29 PFAS of emerging and growing concern. Search and study eligibility: We will search the electronic database PubMed for health or toxicological studies on 29 PFAS of emerging concern. Eligible studies must contain primary research investigating the link between one or more of the PFAS of interest and a health effect, toxicological, or biological mechanistic endpoint. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Title and abstract screening and full text review will require a single reviewer for inclusion to the next level and two independent reviewers for exclusion. Study quality will not be conducted for this evidence mapping. Study characteristics will be extracted and coded from the included studies and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer. The extracted and coded information will be visualized in a publicly available, interactive database hosted on Tableau Public. Results of the evidence mapping will be published in a narrative summary. © 2019},

abstract={Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) is the catalytic conversion of syngas into several products such as hydrocarbons, oxygenates and H2O. H2O is a key by-product of the FTS process and because a Co based catalyst has a low water-gas shift activity, the concentration of H2O increases with time on stream in FTS. While H2O has a positive influence on C5+ selectivity and a negative impact on CH4 selectivity, for virtually every Co based catalyst, the same cannot be said for the activity of all Co based catalysts, because H2O affects the activity of various Co based catalysts in different ways. Most authors observe a positive H2O effect for SiO2-supported Co catalysts and TiO2-supported Co catalysts; however, with γ-Al2O3-supported Co catalysts, a negative influence of H2O is widely reported. In addition, the impact of H2O on carbon nanofiber-supported Co catalysts is reported in literature to be positive. We propose that the phase of H2O in FTS and the water-affinity and/or resistance behavior of catalyst supports could influence the activity and selectivity of Co-based catalysts and that this could help in explaining the kinetic effect of H2O in FT synthesis. © 2019},

abstract={Background: Several studies have investigated the possible association between prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and birth anthropometry. However, none has assessed fetal size longitudinally. We studied the possible association between PFASs and fetal biometry. Methods: In 1230 mother–child pairs of three cohorts from the Spanish INMA-Project, we analyzed perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) in first-trimester maternal plasma (collection: 2003–2008). We measured abdominal circumference (AC), femur length (FL), biparietal diameter (BPD), and estimated fetal weight (EFW) by ultrasounds at 12, 20, and 34 gestational weeks. We conducted multivariable linear regression analyses between log2-transformed (PFASs) and SD-scores of fetal parameters in each cohort and subsequent meta-analysis. We also assessed effect modification by sex and maternal smoking. Results: PFHxS, PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA medians were: 0.58, 2.35, 6.05, and 0.65 ng/mL, respectively. There were no associations for the whole population in any trimester of pregnancy. However, we found an indication that maternal smoking modified the effect in different directions depending on the PFAS. Among smokers (31%), we found negative associations between both PFOA and PFNA and FL or EFW at week 20 (% change ranging between −6.8% and −5.7% per twofold PFAS increase) and positive associations between PFHxS or PFOS and BPD at week 34 (6.8% and 6.3%, respectively). Conclusions: Results did not suggest an overall association between prenatal PFASs and fetal growth. The results among smokers should be taken with caution and further studies are warranted to elucidate the possible role of smoking in this association. © 2019 The Authors},

Herein, 40 occupational workers from a factory in China and 52 control subjects from the general population were involved in an investigation on the potential health concerns of occupational exposure to PFASs by mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analysis. The PFAS levels in plasma from both groups were analyzed. Six PFAS congeners (ς6PFASs) were found to be the main components of the 13 detected PFASs, with a geometric mean of 1770 and 22.2 ng mL-1 in occupational workers and the general population, respectively. Metabolic profiles of the plasma samples were acquired using liquid chromatography coupled with orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The partial least-squares-discriminant analysis model indicated that the plasma metabolic profiles of the two groups could be clearly separated. Differential and correlation analyses were applied to discover potential biomarkers. A total of 14 potential biomarkers were identified, and they were found to be associated with oxidative stress, fatty acid β-oxidation disorder, and kidney injury. The obtained results indicated that the health effects of occupational exposure to PFASs on workers should not be ignored. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Methylmercury (MeHg) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) are major contaminants of human blood that are both common in dietary fish, thereby raising questions about their combined impact on human development. Here, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats ingested a daily dose, from gestational day 1 through to weaning, of either 1 mg/kg bw PFOS (PFOS-only), 1 mg/kg MeHg (MeHg-only), a mixture of 0.1 mg/kg PFOS and 1 mg/kg MeHg (Low-Mix), or of 1 mg/kg of PFOS and 1 mg/kg MeHg (High-Mix). Newborns were monitored for physical milestones and reflexive developmental responses, and in juveniles the spontaneous activity, anxiety, memory, and cognition were assessed. Targeted metabolomics of 199 analytes was applied to sectioned brain regions of juvenile offspring. Newborns in the High-Mix group had decreased weight gain as well as delayed reflexes and innate behavioral responses compared to controls and individual chemical groups indicating a toxicological interaction on early development. In juveniles, cumulative mixture effects increased in a dose-dependent manner in tests of anxiety-like behavior. However, other developmental test results suggested antagonism, as PFOS-only and MeHg-only juveniles had increased hyperactivity and thigmotaxic behavior, respectively, but fewer effects in Low-Mix and High-Mix groups. Consistent with these behavioral observations, a pattern of antagonism was also observed in neurochemicals measured in rat cortex, as PFOS-only and MeHg-only juveniles had altered concentrations of metabolites (e.g., lipids, amino acids, and biogenic amines), while no changes were evident in the combined exposures. The cortical metabolites altered in PFOS-only and MeHg-only exposed groups are involved in inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission. These proof-of-principle findings at relatively high doses indicate the potential for toxicological interaction between PFOS and MeHg, with developmental-stage specific effects. Future mixture studies at lower doses are warranted, and prospective human birth cohorts should consider possible confounding effects from PFOS and mercury exposure on neurodevelopment.

abstract={The durability of magnetorheological (MR) fluid is a fundamental aspect of any MR device, as MR fluid is submitted to shear stresses that cause its degradation. While various studies have identified MR fluid degradation behaviors and proposed improvements, there exists no generalized failure theory to help understand the in-use degradation of MR fluids. In this regard, this study suggests that a relation exists between the Mason number and the maximum achievable lifetime dissipated energy (LDE) of MR fluids. To validate this hypothesis, custom (perfluoropolyether) and commercial (hydrocarbon) MR fluids are aged in various Mason number conditions using a clutch-type durability device. Experimental results show that under a critical Mason number of ∼1, LDE of the MR fluids can be related to the Mason Number using an analogy to metal fatigue failure. Above this critical Mason number, the fundamental degradation mechanism appears to change from a dominant mechanical wear of the particles (i.e. particle-limited) to another mechanism (i.e. fluid-limited) which is not yet fully understood. Since MR generally operate well below the critical Mason number of ∼1, the relation between the Mason number and the particle-limited regime durability of MR fluids can be very useful to design novel MR fluids or MR devices, as it provides a way to estimate the impact of various design strategies on the total expected life of the device. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Generally, AGD appears to be a promising, easily obtainable marker of male reproductive health. Maternal exposure to phthalates has been associated with shorter AGD in male offspring although not consistently, whereas too few studies on the effects of exposure to PFAS and BPA on AGD are found to draw firm conclusion. Meta-analyses suggest that adult phthalate exposure may affect semen quality, whereas the results for the effect of PFAS and BPA exposure on semen quality are contradictory. Interestingly, few studies suggest that maternal exposure to these chemicals may affect semen quality in the offspring. It is therefore important to conduct birth cohort studies focusing on the effect of exposures during vulnerable time windows. They should include biological material and focus on multiple exposures and have the necessary size and long-term follow-up with clinical examinations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

We used Metabolome-Wide Association Studies (MWAS) and pathway enrichment analysis for metabolic associations with PFOS, its precursor EtFOSAA, and EtFOSAA-to-PFOS ratio. Distinct metabolic profiles were found with EtFOSAA and PFOS. Urea cycle metabolites such as arginine, lysine and creatine had opposite associations with EtFOSAA (negative) and PFOS (positive); whereas, carnitine shuttle metabolites were found to be exclusively and positively associated with PFOS indicating perturbation in fatty acid metabolism. These differential metabolic associations for precursor and end-product represent an important first step in identifying how PFASs alter the in utero environment and potentially leads to disease risk. © 2019},

abstract={The compound sodium ρ-perfluorous nonenoxybenzene sulfonate (OBS), a new kind of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl compound, is a surfactant for increasing oil production, and it has been widely detected in various organisms. Because of its wide use, OBS is detectable in the environment. However, knowledge about the biological toxicity of OBS to animals is very limited. Here, male mice were exposed to 0, 0.1, 1 or 10 μg/L of OBS for 6 weeks via drinking water. It was demonstrated that OBS was highly bioaccumulated both in the liver and gut in the mice after low doses of OBS exposure. Curiously, a low dose of OBS exposure also caused gut barrier dysfunction by decreasing mucus secretion and altering Ionic transport in the gut via the CFTR pathway. In addition, liver function was influenced by OBS at both the histopathological and physiological levels. Hepatic transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis showed a total of 1157 genes, and multiple metabolites changed significantly in the livers of mice exposed to low-dose OBS for 6 weeks. The functions of these changed genes and metabolites are tightly related to glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid transport, and β-oxidation. All these results indicate that the liver and gut are important target tissues for OBS exposure. Importantly, it is possible that high levels of bioaccumulation of OBS in the gut and liver might directly cause gut barrier dysfunction and hepatic metabolism disorder in mice. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Toxicokinetics are important for extrapolating health effects and effect levels observed in laboratory animals to humans for purposes of establishing health-based criteria. We conducted a comprehensive review of key absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)parameters across different mammalian species for five perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)and discussed how these data can be used to inform human health risk assessment of these substances. Our analysis revealed several notable differences among the different PFAS regarding species- and substance-specific tissue partitioning, half-life, and transfer to developing offspring via the placenta or lactation, as well as highlighted data gaps for certain substances. We incorporated these observations in an analysis of whether health-based values for specific PFAS can be applied to other PFAS of differing chain length or toxicological mode of action. Overall, our analysis provides one of the first syntheses of available empirical PFAS toxicokinetic data to facilitate interpreting human relevance of animal study findings and developing health-based criteria for PFAS from such studies. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are accepted treatments for end-stage isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). However, complications and re-operations have historically differed between the two procedures. We performed a systematic review to report on the re-operation rates between TKA and modern PFA for isolated PFOA. Methods: Systematically identified publications reporting on patients that underwent either TKA or modern PFA for isolated PFOA were reviewed. Meta-analysis software was used to screen potential articles with at least one year follow-up that detailed reasons for re-operation. Data was extracted and analyzed for all re-operations. Survival of the implant was used as the primary outcome; return to the operating room (OR) for any reason was used as a secondary outcome. Results: The weighted rate of either conversion or revision arthroplasty in the PFA group and the TKA group was 6.34 and 0.11, respectively. The weighted rate of return to the OR for bony and soft tissue procedures was 1.06 and 0.79, respectively. The weighted rate of manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA) was 0.32 and 1.23, respectively. Conclusion: Patients who undergo PFA may be more likely to return to the operating room for conversion to TKA and/or revision surgery than those who undergo TKA. © 2019, SICOT aisbl.},

abstract={Background: Patellofemoral Arthroplasty (PFA) has been shown to be successful in restoring knee function and quality of life in patients with the isolated patellofemoral disease. Patient satisfaction has been suggested as an indicator of the quality of elective orthopedic operations, although there remains no standardized method to collect and evaluate satisfaction. The present study offers a systematic review of the available literature concerning patient satisfaction following PFA to assess common methodologies for reporting patient satisfaction. Methods: A query of the Medline database produced 116 articles that were reviewed for inclusion in the review. The following inclusion criteria were used to identify suitable articles: English language, clinical outcomes study related to PFA, and patient-reported satisfaction as an outcome measure. Results: Seven studies met inclusion criteria and were eligible for review. The highest level of evidence was level-III. The study publication dates ranged from 2009 to 2016, with six published in 2015 & 2016. In total, 320 PFAs were performed on 267 patients. Four articles reported the proportion of included patients who had previous knee surgeries (range: 20–60%). Three studies used ordinal scales to rate patient satisfaction. Four studies (57.1%) reported the numeric proportion of patients satisfied following PFA, which ranged from 76% to 96.5%. Two studies used Visual Analog Scale methods. For these two studies, one of them reported the mean satisfaction score as 7.5/10, and the other reported a median of 90/100. Conclusions: The available literature on patient satisfaction after PFA was found to be limited, with low-quality evidence and variable methodology. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Avian egg production demands resources such as lipids and proteins. Relative egg size and mass varies across species, reflecting differences in maternal investment. This variability may affect the maternal transfer of anthropogenic pollutants including lipophilic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and protein-associated per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mercury (Hg). We conducted a meta-analysis on seabirds and investigated whether interspecies variation in maternal investment contributes toward skewed pollutant concentration ratios between males and females, as Cmale/Cfemale (80 studies). Overall concentrations of PCBs and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were 1.6 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, in males than females, whereas mercury was similar between sexes. Few studies compared females and eggs (n = 6), highlighting a knowledge gap. We found that an increasing maternal investment as a clutch-to-female mass ratio resulted in lower PCB concentrations in females than in males during the incubation period, but no sex-specific differences were observed for mercury and PFOS. Egg production is both a lipid dominated and protein-limited process. Females transfer lipophilic pollutants more easily to eggs, and to a higher degree with increasing maternal investment, but feeding ecology may be more important. Interspecies variation in maternal pollutant transfer may lead to negative effects scaling from an offspring to population level. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells and electrolysers offer efficient use and production of hydrogen for emission-free transport and sustainable energy systems. Perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membranes like Nafion® and Aquivion® are the state-of-the-art PEMs, but there is a need to increase the operating temperature to improve mass transport, avoid catalyst poisoning and electrode flooding, increase efficiency, and reduce the cost and complexity of the system. However, PSFAs-based membranes exhibit lower mechanical and chemical stability, as well as proton conductivity at lower relative humidities and temperatures above 80 °C. One approach to sustain performance is to introduce inorganic fillers and improve water retention due to their hydrophilicity. Alternatively, polymers where protons are not conducted as hydrated H3O+ ions through liquid-like water channels as in the PSFAs, but as free protons (H+) via Brønsted acid sites on the polymer backbone, can be developed. Polybenzimidazole (PBI) and sulfonated polyetheretherketone (SPEEK) are such materials, but need considerable acid doping. Different composites are being investigated to solve some of the accompanying problems and reach sufficient conductivities. Herein, we critically discuss a few representative investigations of composite PEMs and evaluate their significance. Moreover, we present advances in introducing electronic conductivity in the polymer binder in the catalyst layers. © 2019 by the authors.},

To address the significant limitations of allogenic packed red blood cells and the urgent medical need for better resuscitative therapies for both combat casualties and civilians, there has been significant research invested in developing safe, effective, and field deployable artificial oxygen carriers. This article provides a comprehensive review of the most important technologies in the field of artificial oxygen carriers including cell-free and encapsulated hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers, perfluorocarbon emulsions, natural hemoglobin alternatives, as well as other novel technologies.

Identifying the metabolic changes induced by PFAS exposure could enhance our understanding of biological pathways underlying PFAS toxicity. Objective: To identify metabolic alterations associated with serum concentrations of four PFAS in children using a metabolome-wide association study. Methods: We performed untargeted metabolomic profiling by liquid chromatography with ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry, and separately quantified serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) for 114 8-year old children from Cincinnati, OH. We evaluated associations between each serum PFAS concentration and 16,097 metabolic features using linear regression adjusted for child age, sex, and race with a false discovery rate < 20%. We annotated PFAS-associated metabolites and conducted pathway enrichment analyses. Results: Serum PFAS concentrations were associated with metabolic features annotated primarily as lipids and dietary factors. Biological pathways associated with all four PFAS included arginine, proline, aspartate, asparagine, and butanoate metabolism. Conclusions: In this cross-sectional study, childhood serum PFAS concentrations were correlated with metabolic pathways related to energy production and catabolism. Future studies should determine whether these pathways mediate associations between PFAS exposure and childhood cardiometabolic health. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

These approaches enable qualitative and/or quantitative characterization of binding parameters, such as the binding affinity constant and binding stoichiometry. For each approach, we review its principles and evaluate inherent strengths and limitations. In addition, the main methodologies for the identification of binding sites and target proteins are reviewed.

abstract={The persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic properties of certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) raise concerns for environmental and human health. This has led to the gradual phase-out from production and commerce of some legacy PFAS. Fluoroalkylether compounds (ether-PFAS) are among the fluorinated alternative chemicals that are beginning to be reported in impacted and background environments. Extensive monitoring activities were conducted since 2015–2019 to bridge knowledge gaps on the environmental fate and effects of ether-PFAS including F-53B (6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate [6:2 Cl-PFAES] and 8:2 Cl-PFAES), Gen-X (hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid [HFPO-DA]), and ADONA (dodecafluoro-3H-4,8-dioxanonanoate). In recent years, advances in nontarget screening using high-resolution mass spectrometry have revealed the identities of other infrequently monitored ether-PFAS. In this critical review, we provide an up-to-date inventory of the structures of ether-PFAS discovered in the recent literature. Their environmental occurrence, fate, and effects are discussed on a comparative perspective with some legacy PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). Information on the methods employed for the quantitative and semi-quantitative analysis of ether-PFAS is also provided, including sample preparation and mass spectrometry analysis, analytical performance, and limitations. In particular, the compiled database of MS/MS fragment ions (n = 111) can be useful in spectrum interpretation of novel ether-PFAS. The concluding remarks open on possible research avenues and the challenges that remain to be addressed. © 2019},

abstract={Introduction: Due to inconsistent results and high failure rates, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is more often used to treat isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) despite the theoretical advantage of patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA). It is perceived that second-generation PFA may have improved the outcomes of surgery. In this systematic review, the primary aim was to compare outcomes of second-generation PFA and TKA by assessment of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Methods: A systematic search was made in PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and MeSH to identify studies using second-generation PFA implants or TKA for treatment of PFOA. Only studies using The American Knee Society (AKSS), The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) or The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) to report on PROMs were included. Results: The postoperative weighted mean AKSS knee scores were 88.6 in the second-generation PFA group and 91.8 in the TKA group. The postoperative weighted mean AKSS function score was 79.5 in the second-generation PFA group and 86.4 in the TKA group. There was no significant difference in the mean AKSS knee or function scores between the second-generation PFA group and the TKA group. The postoperative weighted mean OKS score was 36.7 and the postoperative weighted mean WOMAC score was 24.4. The revision rate was higher in the second-generation PFA group (113 revisions [8.4%]) than in the TKA group (3 revisions [1.3%]). Progression of OA was most commonly noted as the reason for revision of PFA, and it was noted in 60 cases [53.1%]; this was followed by pain in 33 cases [29.2%]. Conclusion: Excellent postoperative weighted mean AKSS knee scores were found in both the second-generation PFA group and in the TKA group, suggesting that both surgical options can result in a satisfying patient-reported outcome. Higher revision rates in the second-generation PFA studies may in part be due to challenges related to patient selection. Based on evaluation of PROMs, the use of second-generation PFA seems to be an equal option to TKA for treatment of isolated PFOA in appropriately selected patients. Hopefully, this can be considered by physicians in their daily clinical work. Level of evidence: IV. © 2018, European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery, Arthroscopy (ESSKA).},

METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Cocharane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, China Science and Technology Papers and Citation Database (CSTPCD) and China Journal Full-text Database (CNKI) were searched for published randomized controlled trials before January 1, 2019. Two researchers independently screened the literature in the light of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, evaluated the quality of the studies and extracted the data which were consisted of clinical efficacy indexes, such as incision length, operation time,intraoperative blood loss, weight-bearing time,fracture-healing time, Harris hip score and safety indicators like complications. Meta-analysis was performed with the Revman 5.3 software provided by Cochrane Community in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) standard. RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled trials met the requirement with a total of 779 patients, of whom 383 were fixed with PFNA and 396 with DHS. Meta-analysis demonstrated that PFNA was associated with smaller surgical incision length [MD=-7.43, 95%CI (-9.31, -5.55), P<0.05], shorter operation time [MD=-22.76, 95%CI (-29.57, -11.95), P<0.05], less intraoperative blood loss [MD=-216.34, 95%CI (-275.18, - 157.49), P<0.05], earlier weight bearing after surgery [MD=-12.34, 95%CI (-17.71, -6.97), P<0.05], shorter fracture healing time [MD=-5.00, 95%CI (-7.73, -2.26), P<0.05], higher postoperative Harris hip score [MD=12.22, 95%CI (3.88, 20.55), P<0.05], higher rate of excellent Harris hip score [OR=3.56, 95%CI (1.44, 8.81), P<0.05] and lower incidence rate of postoperative complications [OR=0.48, 95%CI (0.33, 0.70), P<0.05], such as hip varus, wound infection, urinary tract infection, pulmonary infection, pressure sore, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, heart failure and cerebral infraction when compared with DHS. No statistical difference was shown between the groups when it came to subgroup analysis by age. However, there was no significant difference (P>0.05) in the duration of hospitalization and the complications resulting in the occurrences of internal fixation loosening, such as femoral shaft fracture (during or post operation), internal fixation fracture, cut-out, displacement or retraction. CONCLUSION: Current published evidence supports the superiority of PFNA to DHS for unstable intertrochanteric fractures in terms of clinical efficacy. The conclusion was limited because of the relatively low quality of evidence with low strength of confidence. Large scale and high-quality randomized controlled trials are required to validate the safety of PFNA and DHS for unstable intertrochanteric fractures.},

abstract={Due to highly recalcitrant and toxicological nature of halogenated organic compounds, conventional anaerobic dehalogenation is often limited by low removal rate and poor process stability. Besides, the reduction intermediates or products formed during dehalogenation process, which are still toxic, required further energy-intensive aerobic post-treatment. In this study, an up-flow electricity-stimulated anaerobic system (ESAS) was developed by installing cathode underneath and anode above to realize simultaneous anaerobic debromination and mineralization of 4-bromophenol (4-BP). When cathode potential was −600 mV, high TOC removal efficiency (98.78 ± 0.96%), complete removal of 4-BP and phenol could be achieved at 4-BP loading rate of 0.58 mol m−3 d−1, suggesting debrominated product of 4-BP from cathode (i.e., phenol) would be utilized as the fuel by the bioanode of ESAS. Under high 4-BP loading rate (2.32 mol m−3 d−1) and low electron donor dosage (4.88 mM), 4-BP could be completely removed at acetate usage ratio as low as 4.21 ± 1.42 mol acetate mol−1 4-BP removal in ESAS, whereas only 13.45 ± 1.38% of 4-BP could be removed at acetate usage ratio as high as 31.28 ± 3.38 mol acetate mol−1 4-BP removal in control reactor. Besides, electrical stimulation distinctly facilitated the growth of various autotrophic dehalogenation species, phenol degradation related species, fermentative species, homoacetogens and electrochemically active species in ESAS. Moreover, based on the identified intermediates and the bacterial taxonomic analysis, possible metabolism mechanism involved in enhanced anaerobic debromination and mineralization of 4-BP in ESAS was proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Volume 68 contains a rudimentary inferential analysis concerning conditions in the US such as the variation of the atmospheric content of carbon dioxide over two hundred and seventy two years up to 2016, and the contribution of major environmental sources to the atmospheric amount of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and methane along with emissions caused by hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphurhexafluoride and nitrogentrifluoride. The following chapter aims to present an overview of environmentally exploitable properties, as well as present and potential prospects of bacterial extracellular polymeric substances in addressing real life environmental problems. The authors go on to review the heavy metal processes that occur in the soil and leafy vegetables, particularly in cabbage, and the relationships between the soil levels and metal contents in plants.An approach for the utilization of microorganisms from shallow hydrothermal vent sediments in environmental biotechnology is also presented. Next, it is shown that that SDG 13 and SDG 15 can be addressed simultaneously if policy makers and practitioners focus on reducing the costs of telecommunications and the internet, as this would reduce the costs for tablets and mobile phones, enabling improved access to information and practice on Ecosystem Based Adaptation and microforestry schemes. The authors discuss the responsibility of the Water Board of Nicosia to operate the water distribution network that covers more than 91 sq. km, water mains of 1,280 km length, and the management of the 13 water reservoirs. They also show how water management is governed and how it affects theiIsland of Cyprus. The subsequent study indicates that concentrations of trace elements in sediments and brackish wate,r and even interstitious waters, may not provide an accurate view of the levels of contamination and their potential ecotoxicity in the Northern Gulf of Mexico.

abstract={In this article, the characteristic mode analysis (CMA) of general metallic-dielectric structures is performed using the volume-surface integral equation (VSIE). The whole-structure and substructure formulations for the CMA are presented and discussed. It is proven that only the substructure operator is symmetrical and therefore fulfills CMA's theoretic requirements. Such a symmetrical operator ensures that the computed eigencurrents are orthogonal and the eigenvalues are real numbers. Numerical analysis verifies that the substructure formulation yields more accurate results than the whole-structure one. A smartphone chassis on an FR-4 substrate and a split-ring resonator (SRR) on a Teflon substrate are analyzed using the presented method. The influence of the mesh size is discussed and it is shown that the volume mesh density increases at a rate similar to the surface mesh. In short, the volume-surface integral formulation with a substructure treatment is versatile, stable, and reasonably efficient for the CMA of thin metallicdielectric structures with planar or curved shapes. © 1990-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Human exposure to environmental chemical contaminants at critical periods of development can lead to lifelong health consequences. Traditionally, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are thought to experience higher contaminant exposures; however, this relationship may not hold for all contaminants. Methods: Using data from six European birth cohorts (1301 mother-child pairs), we determined biomarkers of exposure to 41 contaminants in biological samples from children (6–12 years) and their mothers during pregnancy, including organochlorine compounds (OCs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), metals, phthalate metabolites, phenols, and organophosphate (OP) pesticide metabolites. We analyzed these biomarkers with several socioeconomic position (SEP) indicators (maternal education, employment status and family affluence scale). Results: Higher SEP was associated with higher concentrations of several chemicals during pregnancy, including certain PFASs, mercury, arsenic, several phenols, and OP pesticides. Similarly, childhood concentrations of OCs, PFASs, mercury, arsenic, and bisphenol A were higher in higher SEP groups. Conversely, cadmium exposure during pregnancy and exposure to lead and phthalate metabolites in childhood were higher in lower SEP. Principal components representing multiple pollutant exposures showed similar association with SEP. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that environmental chemical contaminant exposure during fetal and childhood life is not exclusively associated to lower SEP and that for several contaminants higher SEP groups incur higher exposure levels. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Microbial fuel cells have gained great interest as an alternative energy conversion system for generating bioenergy. As a bioelectrochemical hybrid system, microbial fuel cells involved in electricity generation and wastewater treatment including nutrients recovery with tremendous benefits such as energy saving, reduced sludge generation and energy conversion. In this review, we mainly emphasize the developments and advancements of electrode and membrane materials for increasing the microbial fuel cell performances in recent years. We reviewed and discussed the different categories of electrode (anode and cathode) materials with various structural, dimensional, compositions and integrations. Moreover, it encloses the cost-effective, biocompatible and highly stable electrode materials with improved microbial fuel cell performance. Using hetero-atom doped 3-Dimensional porous carbon with ultra-fine metal nanoparticles, a large surface area of the electrode material with different dimensional, and new core@shell structure can considerably enhance the oxygen reduction reaction performance during the microbial fuel cell operation. Following this overview, development in membrane materials such as perfluorinated polymer, hydrocarbon polymer, organic-organic hybrid polymer, organic-inorganic hybrid composite, ceramics, and biopolymer membranes are explained in detail. Based on the physical, chemical, mechanical and biocompatible properties, the hybrid composite biopolymer membrane with organic and inorganic additives are recommended as a suitable membrane candidate for increasing the ion conductivity and rectifying the biofouling issues during the long term operation. Finally, the future viewpoints in the microbial fuel cell for effective wastewater treatment process with electricity generation are suggested through various aspects and strategies to afford clean energy and environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={With the aim of studying their in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetics, new chromatographic methods were developed for the determination of three new roflumilast synthetic analogs (I−III) as PDE-4B inhibitors in rat liver S9 fraction, phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, and human and rat plasma. The developed high performance liquid chromatography−ultra violet (HPLC−UV) methods were performed on a Zorbax Eclipse C8 column and UV detection was carried out at 215 nm. The three compounds were tested for their metabolic stability and were found to be metabolically more stable than roflumilast especially the 2-mercaptobenzothiazol-6-yl analog (III) which displayed an in vitro half-life time (247.55 minutes) higher than that of roflumilast (12.29 minutes) and a low in vitro clearance of 5.67 mL/min./kg. Possible phase I metabolites were investigated using ultra-performance liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) showing hydroxylation of the unsubstituted benzothiazol-2-yl (I) and benzothiazole-6-yl (II) analogs and a cleaved benzothiazole metabolite of the 2-mercaptobenzothiazol-6-yl analog (III). Plasma protein binding affinity was tested using equilibrium membrane dialysis method showing a very high percentage (more than 95%) of plasma protein binding of compounds I and II where compound III exhibited lower percentage (53.71%) demonstrating its accessibility for tissue distribution. Also, a UPLC–MS/MS method was developed using an Acquity UPLC BEH shield RP C18 column to be applied to an in vivo pharmacokinetic study in rats following a subcutaneous dose (1 mg/kg). Compounds I−III showed improved in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters especially compound III which displayed a half-life 3-fold greater than roflumilast (21 hours) and a Cmax value of 113.958 ng/mL. Accordingly, this new chemical entity should be subjected to further investigation as it can be a good drug candidate for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

An optimized gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the retrospective detection of SBMTE in human urine. Urine samples were treated with acidic titanium trichloride to reduce β-lyase metabolites to the single analyte SBMTE. After neutralization and precipitation, SBMTE was extracted from urine by C8 solid-phase extraction cartridge and analyzed in the multiple-reaction monitoring mode. The lower limit of quantification was 1 ng/mL with relative standard deviation of <10%. Acceptable intra-day and inter-day precisions and accuracies were obtained. The developed method was successfully measured various levels of SBMTE which could be used as the forensic evidence of such a chemical attack. © 2019 The Author(s).

abstract={Batoids (Chondrichthyes: Batoidea; e.g. stingrays, skates, and guitarfish) comprise more than 55% of elasmobranch taxa and represent ecologically important predators in benthic and pelagic habitats. Although overexploitation and habitat degradation are the two biggest threats to batoid populations, coastal and oceanic pollution is also a pervasive potential threat. In this systematic review, we compile published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea superorder and present contamination patterns, exposure effects, and potential human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found batoids to accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Accumulation of POPs is reported for chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Hg levels in muscle tissue were significantly different among oceanic basins and habitats, consistent with previous global assessments of Hg oceanic background levels. Some batoid species presented Hg levels higher than large pelagic teleost fishes and comparable to sharks. Ecological traits such as, bottom feeding, upper trophic position and elasmobranch-specific physiology and metabolism are discussed as potential factors associated with Hg uptake and accumulation in batoids. Some species exceeded USEPA's maximum contamination safety limits in edible tissues for Hg, As and ΣPCBs. For most trace metals and POPs, there is a lack of studies focusing on contamination levels in batoids. We recommend future research increasing reporting on POPs and trace metals besides Hg in batoids to further investigate the role of Elasmobranch as a bioindicator for marine pollution. © 2019 Elsevier LtdWe surveyed literature on 65 batoids species and found a large range of reported inorganic and organic contaminants at levels below food safety limits, except for Hg, As and PCB. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The wide use of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has led to increasing concern about its human health risks over the past decade. In vivo and in vitro studies are important and effective means to ascertain the toxic effects of PFOS on humans and its toxic mechanisms. This article systematically reviews the human health risks of PFOS based on the currently known facts found by in vivo and in vitro studies from 2008 to 2018. Exposure to PFOS has caused hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, immunotoxicity, thyroid disruption, cardiovascular toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, and renal toxicity in laboratory animals and many in vitro human systems. These results and related epidemiological studies confirmed the human health risks of PFOS, especially for exposure via food and drinking water. Oxidative stress and physiological process disruption based on fatty acid similarity were widely studied mechanisms of PFOS toxicity. Future research for assessing the human health risks of PFOS is recommended in the chronic toxicity and molecular mechanisms, the application of various omics, and the integration of toxicological and epidemiological data. © 2019},

abstract={Given the opportunities provided by internal dosimetry modelling in the interpretation of human biomonitoring (HBM) data, the assessment of the links between exposure to chemicals and observed HBM data can be effectively supported by PBTK modelling. This paper gives a comprehensive review of available human PBTK models for compounds selected as a priority by the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU). We highlight their advantages and deficiencies and suggest steps for advanced internal dose modelling. The review of the available PBTK models highlighted the conceptual differences between older models compared to the ones developed recently, reflecting commensurate differences in research questions. Due to the lack of coordinated strategies for deriving useful biomonitoring data for toxicokinetic properties, significant problems in model parameterisation still remain; these are further increased by the lack of human toxicokinetic data due to ethics issues. Finally, questions arise as well as to the extent they are really representative of interindividual variability. QSARs for toxicokinetic properties is a complementary approach for PBTK model parameterisation, especially for data poor chemicals. This approach could be expanded to model chemico-biological interactions such as intestinal absorption and renal clearance; this could serve the development of more complex generic PBTK models that could be applied to newly derived chemicals. Another gap identified is the framework for mixture interaction terms among compounds that could eventually interact in metabolism. From the review it was concluded that efforts should be shifted toward the development of generic multi-compartmental and multi-route models, supported by targeted biomonitoring coupled with parameterisation by both QSAR approach and experimental (in-vivo and in-vitro) data for newly developed and data poor compounds. © 2019},

A common approach to achieve AA enantioseparation is chiral derivatization. Among the chiral derivatization reagents, (+) or (-)-1-(9-fluorenyl) ethyl chloroformate ((+) or (-)-FLEC) has proved to be one of the most versatile. Suitable chiral selectivity for FLEC derivatives of amino acids could be obtained in reversed-phase HPLC using nonpolar stationary phases (C4, C8 and C18) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) based mobile phases. This study is meant to provide alternatives to the use of THF as organic modifier by evaluating the selectivity obtained on two phenyl based stationary phases for 19 FLEC-DL-AA pairs of diastereomers using UHPLC-MS. Several mobile phases consisting of ammonium acetate and different common organic solvents (acetonitrile (ACN), methanol (MeOH), 2-propanol (IPA)) were tested using gradient elution. Experimental design was employed for the optimization of the separation conditions. In the optimized conditions, complete chiral separation can be achieved for 18 out of 19 FLEC-DL-AAs in less than 30 min. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Poly- and perfluorinated substances (PFAS) comprise more than 3000 individual compounds; nevertheless, most studies to date have focused mainly on the fate, transport and remediation of long-chain PFAS (C > 7). The main objective of this article is to provide the first critical review of the peer-reviewed studies on the analytical methods, occurrence, mobility, and treatment for ultra-short-chain PFAS (C = 2–3) and short-chain PFAS (C = 4–7). Previous studies frequently detected ultra-short-chain and short-chain PFAS in various types of aqueous environments including seas, oceans, rivers, surface/urban runoffs, drinking waters, groundwaters, rain/snow, and deep polar seas. Besides, the recent regulations and restrictions on the use of long-chain PFAS has resulted in a significant shift in the industry towards short-chain alternatives. However, our understanding of the environmental fate and remediation of these ultra-short-chain and short-chain PFAS is still fragmentary. We have also covered the handful studies involving the removal of ultra-short and short-chain PFAS and identified the future research needs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) is a short-chain, six-carbon perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) and is a primary impurity, degradant, and metabolite associated with the short-chain fluorotelomer-based chemistry used globally today. The transition to short-chain fluorotelomer-based products as a cornerstone in replacement fluorochemistry has raised questions regarding potential human health risks associated with exposure to fluorotelomer-based substances and therefore, PFHxA. Here, we present a critical review of data relevant to such a risk assessment, including epidemiological studies and in vivo and in vitro toxicity studies that examined PFHxA acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicity. Key findings from toxicokinetic and mode-of-action studies are also evaluated. Sufficient data exist to conclude that PFHxA is not carcinogenic, is not a selective reproductive or developmental toxicant, and does not disrupt endocrine activity. Collectively, effects caused by PFHxA exposure are largely limited to potential kidney effects, are mild and/or reversible, and occur at much higher doses than observed for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). A chronic human-health-based oral reference dose (RfD) for PFHxA of 0.25 mg/kg-day was calculated using benchmark dose modeling of renal papillary necrosis from a chronic rat bioassay. This RfD is four orders of magnitude greater than the chronic oral RfD calculated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for PFOA. The PFHxA RfD can be used to inform public health decisions related to PFHxA and fluorotelomer precursors for which PFHxA is a terminal degradant. These findings clearly demonstrate that PFHxA is less hazardous to human health than PFOA. The analyses presented support site-specific risk assessments as well as product stewardship initiatives for current and future short-chain fluorotelomer-based products. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) is a short-chain, six-carbon PFAA and is a primary impurity, degradant, and metabolite associated with the short-chain fluorotelomer-based chemistry used in the United States, Europe and Japan today. With the shift towards short-chain PFAA chemistry, uncertainties remain regarding human health risks associated with current exposure levels. Here, we present a critical review and assessment of data relevant to human health risk assessment to today's short-chain PFAA chemistry. Human biomonitoring surveys indicate that PFHxA is infrequently detected in the environment as well as in human serum and urine; however, human health concerns may persist in locations where PFHxA is detected. In a companion paper (Luz et al., 2019) we comprehensively evaluate the available toxicity data for PFHxA, and derive a chronic human health-based reference dose (RfD) for PFHxA of 0.25 mg/kg-day based on benchmark dose modeling of renal papillary necrosis in chronically exposed female rats. In this paper, we apply this RfD in human health-based screening levels calculations, and derive a drinking water lifetime health advisory of 1400 μg/L and a residential groundwater screening level for children of 4000 μg/L. Compared to environmental concentration data, even sites with more elevated concentrations of PFHxA in the environment are at least an order of magnitude lower than these screening levels. Available PFHxA human serum and urine biomonitoring data, used as a biomarker for general population exposure, demonstrates that the general human population exposures to PFHxA are low. Previous estimates of daily intake rates for infants exposed to PFHxA through breast milk, formula, and baby foods (Lorenzo et al., 2016) combined with the most conservative PFHxA peer-reviewed toxicity value (Luz et al., 2019) demonstrate that the margin of safety for PFHxA is high. Therefore, PFHxA and related fluorotelomer precursors currently appear to present negligible human health risk to the general population and are not likely to drive or substantially contribute to risk at sites contaminated with PFAS mixtures. PFHxA may also represent a suitable marker for the safety of fluorotelomer replacement chemistry used today. © 2019},

abstract={Objective: To investigate the prevalence and drug resistance of clinical Klebsiella variicola (K.variicola) isolates and to illuminate the mechanism of drug resistance in carbapenem-resistant strains. Methods: Clinical K. variicola isolates were identified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The antimicrobial susceptibility profile of these strains was determined using broth microdilution. Resistance genes carried by carbapenem-resistant K. variicola strains were detected by PCR with specific primers. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used for molecular typing. A pan-drug resistant strain which was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid sample was analyzed with whole genome sequencing (WGS). Results: Twenty-six isolates were identified as K. variicola by MALDI-TOF MS. Results of the antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that there were 15.4% (4/26) resistant to carbapenem and 11.5% (3/26) unsusceptible to tigecycline. These strains were highly susceptible to amikacin and gentamicin, which accounted for 96.2% (25/26). As for the third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, the resistance rate was 23.1% (6/26). All of the four carbapenem-resistant isolates carried the resistance genes of blaIMP-4, qnrA/B and blaTEM, and one of them was also positive for blaNDM-1 gene. The fosfomycin resistance gene, fosA, was detected in three of them. Molecular typing analysis indicated these isolates belonged to two sequence types (ST) of ST357 (three strains) and ST1737 (one strain). Two plasmids were obtained from the pan-drug resistant strain by WGS, including IncFⅡ/FIB(k) type plasmid (160 kb) that was highly homologous to LMG 23571 plasmid (GenBank: CP013986.1) and IncHⅠ1B/FIB type plasmid (260 kb) sharing high homology with pIMP4_LL34 (GenBank: CP025964.1). Besides the resistance genes mentioned above, the two plasmids also carried a variety of other genes that mediated the resistance to aminoglycosides (strB, strA, armA, aac3-Ⅱd, aadA2), macrolides (msrE, mphE), chloramphenicol (catA2), sulfonamides (sulⅠ) tigecycline (tetA variant) and trimethoprim (dfrA16). However, no virulence genes were detected. Conclusions: In general, the resistance profile of K. variicola was similar to that of Klebsiella pneumoniae, but the differences were that carbapenem-resistant K. variicola strains mainly belonged to ST357 and the leading causes of resistance were carrying the genes encoding IMP-4 and NDM-1 metal β-lactamases. WGC analysis revealed that the pan-drug resistant K. variicola strain carried multiple drug resistance genes without virulence determinants, which might be resulted from the evolution of drug resistance.

abstract={Urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are among the main anthropogenic sources for the release of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) into the environment, which can result in toxic and adverse effects on aquatic organisms and consequently on humans. Unfortunately, WWTPs are not designed to remove CECs and secondary (e.g., conventional activated sludge process, CAS) and tertiary (such as filtration and disinfection) treatments are not effective in the removal of most CECs entering WWTP. Accordingly, several advanced treatment methods have been investigated for the removal of CECs from wastewater, including consolidated (namely, activated carbon (AC) adsorption, ozonation and membranes) and new (such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)) processes/technologies. This review paper gathers the efforts of a group of international experts, members of the NEREUS COST Action ES1403 who for three years have been constructively discussing the state of the art and the best available technologies for the advanced treatment of urban wastewater. In particular, this work critically reviews the papers available in scientific literature on consolidated (ozonation, AC and membranes) and new advanced treatment methods (mainly AOPs) to analyse: (i) their efficiency in the removal of CECs from wastewater, (ii) advantages and drawbacks, (iii) possible obstacles to the application of AOPs, (iv) technological limitations and mid to long-term perspectives for the application of heterogeneous processes, and (v) a technical and economic comparison among the different processes/technologies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

A global strategy aiming to seek halogenated signatures in full-scan high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) fingerprints was developed. The resulting all-in-one user-friendly application, HaloSeeker 1.0, was developed to promote the accessibility of associated in-house bioinformatics tools to a large audience. The ergonomic web user interface avoids any interactions with the coding component while allowing interactions with the data, including peak detection (features), deconvolution, and comprehensive accompanying manual review for chemical formula assignment. HaloSeeker 1.0 was successfully applied to a marine sediment HRMS data set acquired on a liquid chromatography-heated electrospray ionization [LC-HESI(-)] Orbitrap instrument (R = 140 000 at m/z 200). Among the 4532 detected features, 827 were paired and filtered in 165 polyhalogenated clusters. HaloSeeker was also compared to three similar tools and showed the best performances. HaloSeeker's ability to filter and investigate halogenated signals was demonstrated and illustrated by a potential homologue series with C 12 H x Br y Cl z O 2 as a putative general formula. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

The clinical presentation of a brachial plexus neuropathy caused by a tumor depends on the degree of malignancy of the tumor and its localization. We report an illustrative case of a 27-year old female subject with a progressively increasing mass lesion causing brachial plexus compression, ipsilateral shoulder pain, C8 dermatomal paresthesia, and impairment of motor power. The patient underwent surgical resection of the mass and neurolysis of the nerves in the vicinity. Following the surgical procedure, the patient had improvement in the pain and paresthesia that he was suffering from. The histopathological diagnosis revealed a hibernoma, an extremely rare tumor described only once previously in this location. A systematic review of the literature was performed utilizing the PubMed database to access articles published before March 2018, using: A - the term 'hibernoma' in the title/abstract associated with the following MeSH terms: brachial plexus neuropathies OR brachial plexus neuropathy OR nerve compression syndrome, OR brachial plexus; B - the MeSH term 'brachial plexus' associated with the term 'non neural sheath nerve tumor' or 'peripheral non-neural sheath nerve tumor'.

abstract={Antibiotics, as one of the emerging pollutants, are non-biodegradable compounds and long-term exposure to them may affect endocrine, hormonal, and genetic systems of human beings, representing a potential risk for both the environment and human health. The presence of antibiotics in surface waters and drinking water causes a global health concern. Many researches have stated that conventional methods used for wastewater treatment cannot fully remove antibiotic residues, and they may be detected in receiving waters. It is reported that nanoparticles could remove these compounds even at low concentration and under varied conditions of pH. The current study aimed to review the most relevant publications reporting the use of different nanoparticles to remove antibiotics from aqueous solutions. Moreover, meta-analysis was conducted on the results of some articles. Results of meta-analysis proved that different nanoparticles could remove antibiotics with an acceptable efficiency of 61%. Finally, this review revealed that nanoparticles are promising and efficient materials for degradation and removal of antibiotics from water and wastewater solutions. Furthermore, future perspectives of the new generation nanostructure adsorbents were discussed in this study. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In the last years, Salmonella has been extensively studied not only due to its importance as a pathogen, but also as a host to produce pharmaceutical compounds. However, the full exploitation of Salmonella as a platform for bioproduct delivery has been hampered by the lack of information about its metabolism. Genome-scale metabolic models can be valuable tools to delineate metabolic engineering strategies as long as they closely represent the actual metabolism of the target organism. In the present study, a 13C-MFA approach was applied to map the fluxes at the central carbon pathways of S. typhimurium LT2 growing at glucose-limited chemostat cultures. The experiments were carried out in a 2L bioreactor, using defined medium enriched with 20% 13C-labeled glucose. Metabolic flux distributions in central carbon pathways of S. typhimurium LT2 were estimated using OpenFLUX2 based on the labeling pattern of biomass protein hydrolysates together with biomass composition. The results suggested that pentose phosphate is used to catabolize glucose, with minor fluxes through glycolysis. In silico simulations, using Optflux and pFBA as simulation method, allowed to study the performance of the genome-scale metabolic model. In general, the accuracy of in silico simulations was improved by the superimposition of estimated intracellular fluxes to the existing genome-scale metabolic model, showing a better fitting to the experimental extracellular fluxes, whereas the intracellular fluxes of pentose phosphate and anaplerotic reactions were poorly described. © 2018 International Metabolic Engineering Society},

abstract={The causes of neurodegenerative disorders are largely unknown. Environmental factors seem to contribute to neurodegeneration in genetically susceptible individuals. Increasing evidence point towards a key role for environmental exposure in the causation of neurodegenerative disorders and specifically for metal exposure. Alterations of metalloproteins seem to be a common motif in neurodegeneration and enough evidence has now accumulated to designate these disorders as metallopathies. Paired sampling refers to the simultaneous sampling of CSF and blood and by comparing metal concentrations between CSF and blood conclusions about exposure and barrier properties can be drawn. However previous reports on metal concentrations in body fluids in neurodegenerative disorders show a wide variation in results hampering firm conclusions on the role of metals in degeneration of nerve cells. Here we suggest some steps and measures to minimise this variation, most important sampling performed in a cleanroom with filtered air and the use of acid washed perfluoroalkoxy vials. By strict adherence to ultraclean paired sampling technique conclusive results concerning the role of metals in neurodegenerative disorders can be generated. © 2018},

METHODS: Data of the randomized controlled trials(RCTs) about PFNA vs InterTAN for the treatment of the elderly intertrochanteric femoral fractures were searched in as the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMbase, Wanfang, CNKI, CBM and VIP from their establishment to January 2018 for collecting. After study selection, assessment and data extraction conducted by two reviewers independently, meta-analyses were performed by using the RevMan 5.3 sofware. The level of evidence was assessed by using the GRADEpro system. RESULTS: Twelve studies involving 1 015 patients were included. The results of meta, analyses showed that: (1)safety indicator: compared with the InterTAN, PFNA had shorter operation time, and less intraoperative bleeding. But InterTAN had less total postoperative complications and internal fixation failure, but there was no significant difference in the operative incision lengths, fracture healing time and other postoperative complications. (2)efficacy indicator: compared with the InterTAN, the Harris hip score was lower after 3 months, but Harris hip score had no significant difference between the two groups after 6, 12 months. Based on GRADEpro system, all the evidence was at level C and weak recommendation(2C). CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence indicates that PFNA had a similar effect compared with the InterTAN. But InterTAN could provide better stability against rotation and axial pressure effect, can allow patients do functional exercise early such as ambulation to recovery the hip function. It also had less total postoperative complications and internal fixation failure for the poor quality of the original studies and the limited number of studies, a prudent choice is suggested and more high-quality, large-sample studies are need.

abstract={Lightning remote sensing has been used widely to measure the electromagnetic (EM) fields in various frequencies bands. Circular metal plate capacitive antenna made of iron or aluminium have been used widely for the front-end design of the remote sensing system. The circular metal plates are arranged in parallel and separated by insulators made of Teflon. However, three common problems encountered with the existing setting. First, both metals rust easily and could affect the reading of the EM fields. Second, the insulation Teflon separating the metal plates could become weak conductor during heavy rain and thus distort the EM fields reading. Third, the use of Teflon in between the parallel plates changes the overall permittivity value. In this paper, we propose a cheaper and lighter alternative to iron and aluminium plates by changing to FR4 copper plate. Rectangular FR4 copper plate capacitive antennas with 2 sizes, A4 and A3 have been designed and constructed. The rectangular A3 FR4 copper plate has been found to have similar impedance and capacitance values to the iron-based circular metal plate. Analysis of wave shape and peak amplitude ratio showed similar performance between both antennas. Therefore, we conclude that rectangular A3 FR4 copper plate antenna can be used as replacement for the existing iron- or aluminium-based circular metal plates antenna. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Occurrence and concentration of a broad spectrum of micropollutants are investigated in Austrian river catchments, namely polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), organotin compounds, perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) and metals. The parallel analysis across multiple environmental and engineered compartments sheds light on the ratio of dissolved and particulate transport and on differences in concentration levels between point and diffuse emission pathways. It is found that some PAHs and organotins are present in rivers, groundwater and bulk deposition at higher concentrations than in municipal wastewater effluents. Among PFAAs and metals, highest concentrations were recorded either in atmospheric deposition or in discharges from wastewater treatment plants. The relevance of the analysis across compartments is best shown by the case of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Despite municipal wastewater effluents being the emission pathway with highest concentrations, this study reveals that not only rivers, but also atmospheric deposition and groundwater sometimes exceed the environmental quality standard for surface waters. Moreover, this work reveals partially counterintuitive patterns. In rivers with treated wastewater discharges, increasing levels of dissolved compounds were measured at rising flow conditions, whereas the opposite would be expected owing to the dilution effect. This might derive from the mobilisation from soil or suspended particulate matter or rather find its explanation in high concentrations in atmospheric deposition. These hypotheses require however being tested through targeted studies. Additional future research includes the analysis of how regional or catchment specific characteristics might alter the relative importance of different emission pathways, and the modelling of emission and river loads to assess their relative contribution to river pollution. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Originally developed to classify multispectral and hyperspectral images, spectral mapping methods were used to classify Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to estimate the vertical structure of vegetation for Fuel Type (FT) mapping. Three spectral mapping methods generated spatially comprehensive FT maps for Cabañeros National Park (Spain): (1) Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA), (2) Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), and (3) Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). The Vegetation Vertical Profiles (VVPs) describe the vertical distribution of the vegetation and are used to define each FT endmember in a LiDAR signature library. Two different approaches were used to define the endmembers, one based on the field data collected in 1998 and 1999 (Approach 1) and the other on exploring spatial patterns of the singular FT discriminating factors (Approach 2). The overall accuracy is higher for Approach 2 and with best results when considering a five-FT model rather than a seven-FT model. The agreement with field data of 44% for MESMA and SMA and 40% for SAM is higher than the 38% of the official Cabañeros National Park FTs map. The principal spatial patterns for the different FTs were well captured, demonstrating the value of this novel approach using spectral mapping methods applied to LiDAR data. The error sources included the time gap between field data and LiDAR acquisition, the steep topography in parts of the study site, and the low LiDAR point density among others. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Despite the outstanding chemical, thermal and transport properties of amorphous and glassy perfluorinated polymers, only few works exist on the preparation and transport properties of perfluoropolymer/molecular sieves mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs), probably because of their poor compatibility. In this review, the compatibilization of ceramic molecular sieves with perfluorinated matrices is considered first, examining the effect of the surface treatment on the gas transport properties of the filler. Then the preparation of the defect-free hybrid membranes and their gas separation capabilities are described. Finally, recent modelling of the gas transport properties of the perfluoropolymer MMMs is reviewed. The systematic use of molecular sieves of different size and shape, either permeable or impermeable, and the calculation of the bulk transport properties of the molecular sieves-i.e., the unrestricted diffusion and permeability-allow to understand the nature of the physical phenomena at work in the MMMs, that is the larger the perfluoropolymer fractional free volume at the interface, and restricted diffusion at the molecular sieves. This knowledge led to the formulation of a new four-phase approach for the modelling of gas transport. The four-phase approach was implemented in the frame of the Maxwell model and also for the finite element simulation. The four-phase approach is a convenient representation of the transport in MMMs when more than one single interfacial effect is present. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Exceptional properties at the nano-scale, if appropriately harnessed, will lead to innovations in water treatment. Nanomaterials can enable treatment processes with accelerated reaction kinetics, self-healing or self-regeneration abilities, and a high degree of selectivity for targeted pollutant removal. These materials can also introduce new pathways for the removal of contaminants that are challenging to degrade employing traditional techniques. One such class of contaminants is poly- and per-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are widely detected in waterways of the U.S. and drinking water supplies. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has listed two PFAS (i.e., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid or PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid or PFOA) in the Contaminant Candidate List and recently has revised the lifetime health advisories. PFAS molecules are persistent in the environment over long periods because they are not photolyzed or biodegraded. Current mitigation technologies mostly depend on non-destructive phase transfer processes (e.g., adsorption, filtration, or ion exchange) which results in a concentrated waste stream. Few destructive mitigation methods transform PFAS by cleaving C-C bonds but it is not clear if the transformation products (e.g., shorter chain PFAS) are less toxic or less persistent. Thus, the central challenge for PFAS transformation lies in cleaving the strong C-F bonds. Nanomaterials can enable treatment options by providing high-energy reaction pathways; e.g., electrolysis, thermolysis, or photolysis. This perspective aims to present a critical review on reported PFAS removal/destruction techniques, provide molecular-level insights into possible removal/destruction pathways, and propose potential nano-enabled remediation options for these persistent contaminants. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Results obtained showed concentrations in excess of USEPA regulatory standards for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl sulphonates (PFASs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) in water, polychlorinated and polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs) in e-waste soils, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in aquatic organisms and dairy products. The published studies do not cover major regions nationwide. The inconsistency in methods and analytes measured, along with data scarcity in some regions, makes it challenging to identify temporal trends. However, the data did indicate decreasing concentrations of some legacy POPs in soil/sediment and aquatic organisms, with increasing concentrations of some POPs in water, fish, fruits and vegetables. Studies that performed health risks assessments were limited although the data indicated risks to e-waste workers, some farmers and vulnerable sub-populations. This review identified potential human health risks from POPs in the Ghanaian environment and the need for more consistent and widespread monitoring program. This paper provides a critical review of studies of POPs in Ghana which can be used as a reference for all of Africa, as well as other developing countries, for compliance with the requirements for POPs monitoring in the e-waste, food and environmental sectors to inform the mitigation of health risks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Halophenols and haloindoles are the most common haloaryl secondary metabolites isolated from these marine organisms. Nevertheless, some halogenated aromatic sesquiterpenes and naphthalene derivatives have also been isolated. Most of these secondary metabolites showed interesting biological activities, such as antitumor, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, and antioxidant. This review describes in a systematic way the distribution and natural occurrence of halogenated aromatic secondary metabolites from extracts of red, brown, and green algae, as well as biological activities reported for these compounds. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Motivation Elementary flux mode (EFM) analysis allows an unbiased description of metabolic networks in terms of minimal pathways (involving a minimal set of reactions). To date, the enumeration of EFMs is impracticable in genome-scale metabolic models. In a complementary approach, we introduce the concept of a flux tope (FT), involving a maximal set of reactions (with fixed directions), which allows one to study the coordination of reaction directions in metabolic networks and opens a new way for EFM enumeration. Results A FT is a (nontrivial) subset of the flux cone specified by fixing the directions of all reversible reactions. In a consistent metabolic network (without unused reactions), every FT contains a ' €' maximal pathway', carrying flux in all reactions. This decomposition of the flux cone into FTs allows the enumeration of EFMs (of individual FTs) without increasing the problem dimension by reaction splitting. To develop a mathematical framework for FT analysis, we build on the concepts of sign vectors and hyperplane arrangements. Thereby, we observe that FT analysis can be applied also to flux optimization problems involving additional (inhomogeneous) linear constraints. For the enumeration of FTs, we adapt the reverse search algorithm and provide an efficient implementation. We demonstrate that (biomass-optimal) FTs can be enumerated in genome-scale metabolic models of B.cuenoti and E.coli, and we use FTs to enumerate EFMs in models of M.genitalium and B.cuenoti.

abstract={In the children toys market, manufacturers are struggling to make the most profits, offering different products, some of which are of questionable quality and pose a potential danger to the health of children. The aim of the paper was to determine the content of heavy metals: cadmium, lead, zinc, iron and cobalt in coloured plastic toys. Another aim was to compare the concentration of these heavy metals in toys manufactured in China and the EU. Samples were prepared by wet digestion in the microwave oven Anton Paar Multiwave 3000. The sample was discharged in a mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide in Teflon vessels in a ratio of 1 ml H2 O2 and 6 ml HNO3. The measurement was performed by atomic absorption spectrometry by flame technique, on the instrument ‘Perkin Elmer’ Analyst-800 with Zeeman correction. Six different types of children toys were analysed. The largest measured concentration for Cd was in sample 1 and it was 0.9 μg/kg, while in samples 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, Cd concentrations were below instrument detection for said heavy metal. The Pb content in all samples was below the limit of detection of flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The highest concentration of Co was in sample number 3 and it amounted to 5.6 μg/kg while in the sample 2 the value was 3.5 μg/kg. The content of Zn in sample 2 was 213.7 μg/kg, while the other values were slightly lower. The lowest Fe concentration value was in sample number 1 from 6.8 μg/ kg and the highest 617.7 μg/kg in the sample 5. The concentrations of all the analysed heavy metals in the scabbard parts from the toy for children were within the permissible concentration limits that have been prescribed by Directive 2009/48/EC on the safety of toys, and therefore these toys do not pose a risk to children health. Also, there were no major rejections of heavy metal concentrations in children toys, regardless of the origin of production (China or the EU). © 2019, Scibulcom Ltd.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment is an accepted method for intertrochanteric fractures. For the older adults accompanied by severe osteoporosis and other diseases, how to treat intertrochanteric fractures still remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of proximal femoral nail antirotation versus hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in older adults through meta-analysis. METHODS: According to the Cochrane system evaluation, a computer-based retrieval of Medline, PubMed, SPINGER, John Wiley, Science Direct, EBSCO, CNKI, WanFang, and VIP databases between 2008 and 2018 was performed. The keywords were “proximal femoral nail antirotation or PFNA, hemiarthroplasty, unstable intertrochanteric fractures” in English and Chinese, respectively. The literate was screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then quality evaluation was conducted. Meta-analysis was undergone on the Rev-Man 5.1 software. RUSULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Thirteen clinical trials were included, involving 1 223 patients, and including 6 randomized controlled trials. (2) Meta-analysis results showed that the operation time in the proximal femoral nail antirotation group was shorter [MD=-6.54, 95%Cl (-12.81, -0.21), P < 0.01], intraoperative blood loss was lower [MD=-130.83, 95%CI (-190.99, -70.68), P < 0.01], and the incidence of implant complications was higher [RR=2.32, 95%Cl (1.12, 4.84), P < 0.01] compared with the hemiarthroplasty group. (3) In the hemiarthroplasty group, the ambulation time was earlier [MD=18.06, 95%CI (10.3±25.79), P < 0.000 1], and the Harris scores were increased [MD=-8.19, 95%Cl (-9.45, -6.93), P < 0.01] compared with the proximal femoral nail antirotation group. (4) There was no significant difference in the postoperative complications, hospitalization time or excellent and good rate in Harris scores between two groups (P > 0.05). (5) In summary, the operation time in the proximal femoral nail antirotation group is shorter and the amount of bleeding was less than those in the hemiarthroplasty group, but the incidence of implant complications is higher than that in the hemiarthroplasty group. The hemiarthroplasty group has an advantage in postoperative Harris score and postoperative loading time. © 2019, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

abstract={The Vieques Naval Training Range (VNTR) was used for military training by the United States and allied nations from the early 1940s until 2003. The Live Impact Area (LIA) on VNTR covers roughly 400 acres and was used for air-to-ground ordnance, artillery, and individually served weapons training. When the VNTR was decommissioned in 2003, the Navy began removal and disposal of munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) under both a time critical and non-time critical removal action (TCRA and NTCRA) in accordance with CERCLA guidance. Air monitoring was performed between 2005 – 2013 at remote locations on the LIA and elsewhere inside the VNTR to evaluate any potential impact on air quality associated with munitions removal. During that time, air quality as represented by PM10, was monitored using beta attenuation monitors that were configured with a Teflon tape to allow subsequent analysis for metals and explosives residues. Due to the remote location with limited infrastructure, these systems were powered with solar and batteries. The monitoring included over 1,400 air samples collected during more than 160 detonation events. No explosives were detected during any of the air monitoring events. There were no detections of mercury, lead, cadmium, tin, or phosphorus. The naturally occurring metals iron, nickel, copper, chromium, and arsenic were detected at concentrations well below health-based standards. In 2016, EPA equivalent monitors for PM10, PM2.5, and CO using municipal power grid service were installed in nearby populated areas for follow-on monitoring. After the destruction caused by Hurricane Maria, there was a need to transition back to low power systems due to the absence of reliable, on-island electrical power. Low power systems that do not require a climate-controlled environment were implemented for use in response to ongoing power grid reliability issues. These systems were installed in 2018 to monitor for PM10, PM2.5, and CO at three locations and metals and explosives at one of the three locations. The air monitoring program at the VNTR illustrates how to adapt to changing circumstances while still achieving program objectives, as detailed in this paper. © 2019 Air and Waste Management Association.

This XRF instrument was composed with a low-power X-ray tube, silicon drift detector and home-made small volume of liquid flow cell. The flow cell has volume of 0.2 mL and a window covered with 12 micron polypropylene film. A metallic alloy of 0.2 g was dissolved with a small portion of acidic reagent in a Teflon bottle, and then diluted to sample solution of 10 mL. A portion of the sample solution and internal element solution were mixed by weight and prepared to a sample solution of about 5 mL. We then flowed about 2 mL of this sample solution to the XRF instrument. All spectra of the sample solution were obtained at 3 W of the X-ray tube power output and a 60 sec accumulation time. Major elements of metallic alloy were determined from gross counts or net counts using an internal standard correction method. The recovered weight, that is, the sum weight of the major elements determined by the procedure described above for three kind of iron alloy and two kind of brass, were exactly matched with actually dissolved alloy weight. Concretely, value which was divided by the actually dissolved alloy weight of recovered weight, was obtained in the range of 99.9% to 103.0%. The statistical error was under 2 percent in all cases. Additionally, peak overlapping effects on the accuracy of the elemental determination values for neodymium magnet, which was contained with four rare earth elements was discussed. From the experiment, elemental determination analysis in solution was easily and quickly able to carried out by this compact XRF instrument with liquid flow cell. So that, it is concluded that this method by this XRF instrument with liquid flow cell is effective for the accurate determination of the major element analysis of a metal alloy. © 2019 The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry.},

abstract={Objective  We sought to investigate whether women present adequate knowledge of the main pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) (urinary incontinence - UI, fecal incontinence - FI, and pelvic organ prolapse - POP). Data sources  A systematic review was performed in the MEDLINE, PEDro, CENTRAL, and Cochrane databases for publications from inception to April 2018. Selection of studies  A total of 3,125 studies were reviewed. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of primary outcomes and the diversity of instruments for measuring knowledge. The quality of the articles included in the analysis was evaluated with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) adapted for cross-sectional studies. Data collection  Two authors performed data extraction into a standardized spreadsheet. Data synthesis  Nineteen studies were included, comprising 11,512 women. About the methodological quality (NOS), most of the studies (n = 11) presented a total score of 6 out of 10. Validated questionnaires and designed pilot-tested forms were the most frequently used ways of assessing knowledge. Some studies were stratified by race, age, or group minorities. The most used questionnaire was the prolapse and incontinence knowledge questionnaire (PIKQ) (n = 5). Knowledge and/or awareness regarding PFD was low to moderate among the studies. Urinary incontinence was the most prevalent PFD investigated, and the most important risk factors associated with the lack of knowledge of the pelvic floor were: African-American ethnicity (n = 3), low educational level (n = 4), low access to information (n = 5) and socioeconomic status (n = 3). Conclusion  Most women have a gap in the knowledge of pelvic floor muscle dysfunctions, do not understand their treatment options, and are not able to identify risk factors for these disorders. © 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag.

abstract={Medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diets increase ketone bodies, which are believed to act as alternative energy substrates in the injured brain. Octanoic (C8:0) and decanoic (C10:0) acids, which produce ketone bodies through β-oxidation, are used as part of MCT ketogenic diets. Although the ketogenic role of MCT is well-established, it remains unclear how the network metabolism underlying β-oxidation of these medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) differ. We aim to elucidate basal β-oxidation of these commonly used MCFA at the cellular level. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC) astrocytes were incubated with [U-13C]-C8:0 or [U-13C]-C10:0, and the fractional enrichments (FE) of the derivatives were used for metabolic flux analysis. Data indicate higher extracellular concentrations and faster secretion rates of β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc) with C8:0 than C10:0, and an important contribution from unlabeled substrates. Flux analysis indicates opposite direction of metabolic flux between the MCFA intermediates C6:0 and C8:0, with an important contribution of unlabeled sources to the elongation in the C10:0 condition, suggesting different β-oxidation pathways. Finally, larger intracellular glutathione concentrations and secretions of 3-OH-C10:0 and C6:0 were measured in C10:0-treated astrocytes. These findings reveal MCFA-specific ketogenic properties. Our results provide insights into designing different MCT-based ketogenic diets to target specific health benefits. © 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Approximately 50% of all hip fractures are extracapsular and typically treated with extramedullary or intramedullary fixation. Modern intramedullary nails used for internal fixation of extracapsular fractures are generally cephalomedullary nails secured by at least one cephalic screw. Different designs have been developed, varying in length, diameter, neck shaft angle, number of cephalic screws or blades, ability to slide and/or compress, ability to control rotation, construction materials and insertion-point. Articles published in all languages up to January 2019, are listed in PubMed and Scopus electronic databases about the association between the number of cephalic screws and the rate of complications and functional outcome. Twenty articles were included following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Sliding hip screws (SHS) were the standard of care for hip fractures from the 1950s to the 1990s, but presently intramedullary nails are more commonly used. There has been a more than 20-fold relative increase in the utilization of intramedullary nails since 1999. With the emergence of value-based healthcare, there is a growing interest of how best to provide high-quality care in a clinical and cost-effective manner, acknowledging limited healthcare budgets. The present systematic review assessed the long-term outcomes of the most commonly used nails using double cephalic screws compared with single screw devices in patients with unstable intertrochanteric fractures. The development of new technologies may allow a lower incidence of complications, a reduction in operative time and a lower intraoperative blood loss. © by BIOLIFE, s.a.s.},

abstract={Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been considered as an emerging pollutant. The occurrence of ARGs is mainly due to the overuse of antibiotics. China is the largest producer and consumer of antibiotics in the world, and it was estimated that about 162 000 t of antibiotics were used in China in 2013, among which 52% was used for animal breeding. However, after used, 30%-90% of these veterinary antibiotics were excreted with feces and urine for partially metabolized by animal body. Therefore, animal manure has been considered as an important reservoir of antibiotic residues and ARGs. If not treated effectively, ARGs can enter into other environmental mediums with land application. And ARGs can eventually enter into the human food chain which may endanger the public safety. Anaerobic digestion is a promising technology which can convert the organic matters to biogas and organic fertilizers. So it is widely used for animal manure disposal in different animal farms. Therefore, the variation of ARGs in anaerobic digestion system has big significance for reducing the risk of ARGs growth and transmission. The paper firstly showed that ARGs were ubiquitous in manure, water, soil, food and even in the air, on the basis of analyzing ARGs levels in different environmental mediums. About the detecting methods of ARGs, the main detecting methods contained PCR, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), high-throughput quantitative PCR and metagenomic technique, among which metagenomic technique was the most promising technology for comprehensive analyzing of ARGs in different types. About the variation of ARGs and its driving factors during anaerobic digestion, the paper analyzed the relating literatures at home and abroad. The results showed that the microbial community composition was the main driving factor of ARGs variation, which was due to the variation of the potential host microbes carrying ARGs during anaerobic digestion. Although many studies had investigated the ARGs and their potential hosts through the statistical method, the further confirmation of the real hosts for ARGs was also need. The determination of ARGs host microbes was the difficulty parts for the future research. Antibiotic residues and heavy metals were also the important driving factors for ARGs variation, so it is important to remove the antibiotic residues and heavy metals thoroughly to reduce the environmental risk of ARGs pollution. The mobile genetic elements played a key role in the horizontal transmission of ARGs, and they could be considered as some indicators for ARGs variation. On the whole, all the factors in anaerobic digestion system could directly or indirectly impact the ARGs variation. The operating parameters were the precondition for the whole system. Under the designed operating parameters, the microbial communities interacted with other physicochemical parameters in the anaerobic digestion system. The microbial communities affected the ARGs transmission by mobile genetic elements. Therefore, it was the research emphasis for future work to control ARGs by comprehensive regulation of different factors of anaerobic digestion system. The paper will provide some theoretical information for researchers about the variation, transmission and driving factors of ARGs in anaerobic digestion system with animal manure. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

abstract={Background: The limitless presence of pharmaceutical contaminants in discharged wastewater has emerged as a threat to aquatic species and humans. Their presence in drinking water has although raised substantial concerns, very little is known about the fate and ecological impacts of these pollutants. As a result, these pollutants are inevitably introduced to our food chain at trace concentrations. Unfortunately, the conventional wastewater treatment techniques are unable to treat pharmaceuticals completely with practical limitations. The focus has now been shifted towards nanotechnology for the successful remediation of these persistent pollutants. Thus, the current review specifically focuses on providing readers brief yet sharp insights into applications of various nanomaterials for the removal of pharmaceutical contaminants. Methods: An exhaustive collection of bibliographic database was done with articles having high impact and citations in relevant research domains. An in-depth analysis of screened papers was done through standard tools. Studies were categorized according to the use of nanoscale materials as nano-adsorbents (graphene, carbon nanotubes), nanophotocatalysts (metal, metal oxide), nano-filtration, and ozonation for promising alternative technologies for the efficient removal of recalcitrant contaminants. Results: A total of 365 research articles were selected. The contemporary advancements in the field of nanomaterials for drinking and wastewater treatment have been thoroughly analyzed along with their future perspectives. Conclusion: The recommendations provided in this article will be useful to adopt novel strategies for on-site removal of the emerging contaminants in pharmaceutical effluents and related industries. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers},

abstract={Purpose. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify and review studies comparing SF to C3F8 as a tamponade agent in the intraoperative management of macular holes. Methods. Publications up to October 2018 that focused on macular hole surgery in terms of primary closure, complications, and clinical outcomes were included. Forest plots were created using a weighted summary of proportion meta-analysis. Analysis was performed separately for SF and C3F8. A random effects model was used, and corresponding I2 heterogeneity estimates were calculated. Results. Nine pertinent publications studying a total of 4,715 patients were identified in 2000 to 2017, including two randomized studies (n=206), two prospective studies (n=170), and five retrospective or registry-based studies. Similar rates of closure between SF and C3F8 were reported in eight out of nine studies, regardless of subgroup analyses. All studies reporting visual outcomes showed similar results when comparing SF to C3F8 at one to six months of follow-up. Neither agent was clearly associated with increased risk of ocular hypertension, cataract formation, or other adverse events. Meta-analytic pooling of the closure rates in the SF group resulted in 91.73% (95% confidence interval: 88.40 to 94.55, I2: 38.03%), and for C3F8, the closure rate was 88.36% (95% confidence interval: 85.88 to 90.63, I2: 0.0%). Conclusions. Both SF and C3F8 appear to have achieved similar visual outcomes and primary closure rates and neither was associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Considering the more rapid visual recovery with SF, there appears to be no evidence to support C3F8 as the tamponade agent of choice for macular hole surgery. © 2019 Idan Hecht et al.},

abstract={Background: This meta-analysis aimed to assess whether administration tranexamic acid (TXA) could reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients undergoing intertrochanteric fracture surgery. Methods: We performed an electronic search of PubMed (1950-October 2018), EMBASE (1974-October 2018), the Cochrane Library (October 2018 Issue 3), the Google database (1950-October 2018), and the Chinese Wanfang database (1950-October 2018). Studies were included in accordance with Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Setting (PICOS) including criteria. Intertrochanteric fracture patients prepared for surgery were selected. Administration with TXA and the placebo or no interventions were considered as an intervention and comparators, respectively. Measures related to total blood loss, blood loss in drainage, hemoglobin on postoperative day were analyzed. A fixed/random-effects model was used according to the heterogeneity assessed by the I2 statistic. Data analysis was performed using Stata 12.0 software. Results:A total of five RCTs with 584 patients (TXA group=289, control group=298) were included in the meta-analysis. Based on the results, administration of TXA was associated with a reduction in total blood loss, blood loss in drainage, need for transfusion, length of hospital stay, and occurrence of hematoma (P<.05). Administration of TXA increased the hemoglobin level at 3 days after surgery (P<.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the occurrence of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or infection (P>.05). Conclusion: Administration of TXA is associated with reduced total blood loss, postoperative hemoglobin decline, and transfusion requirements in patients with intertrochanteric fractures. Additional high-quality RCTs should be conducted in the future.

abstract={Perfluoroisobutyronitrile (C4F7N) has received extensive attention over the past three years as an environmental friendly gas insulating medium. At present, there are few studies on the compatibility of C4F7N with metal materials used in the electrical equipment. In this paper, we constructed a gas-solid interfacial reaction platform and carried out aging tests for C4F7N-CO2 gas mixture at different temperatures. The composition of the gas mixture and the surface morphology and the elemental composition of copper, aluminum were explored. The interaction mechanism between C4F7N-CO2 gas mixture and metal surface was also analyzed. It was found that C4F7N-CO2 gas mixture has better compatibility with aluminum than copper. The reaction between C4F7N-CO2 gas mixture and heated copper at 220 °C produces the gaseous by-product C3F6. The surface color of copper deepens and the corrosive degree increases with temperature, while the interaction between C4F7N and heated aluminum does not cause gas decomposition and metal corrosion. In general, the thermal stability of C4F7N-CO2 gas mixture associated with heated copper and aluminum is inferior to that of SF6 © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: It remains unsettled whether prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) affects human reproductive health through potential endocrine disruption. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to explore the associations between prenatal exposure to several PFASs and various aspects of pubertal development in boys and girls. METHODS: We studied two samples (n=722 and 445) from the Puberty Cohort, nested within the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), measuring PFAS in maternal plasma from early gestation. Data on pubertal development were collected biannually from the age of 11 y until full maturation, using web-based questionnaires. Outcomes were age at menarche, voice break, first ejaculation, and Tanner stages 2 to 5 for pubic hair, breast, genital development, and a combined puberty indicator. A regression model for censored data was used to estimate mean difference (months) in age at achieving the pubertal outcomes across tertiles of PFAS concentrations and with a doubling of PFAS concentrations (continuous). For perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), a meta-analysis was used to provide a weighted average of the point estimates from samples 1 and 2. RESULTS: Overall, prenatal exposure to PFOS, perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluoroheptane sulfonate (PFHpS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PDFA) (girls) and PFHxS and PFHpS (boys) was associated with lower mean age at puberty marker onset. PFDA and PFNA exposure was associated with higher mean age at onset of puberty in boys. Nonmonotonic associations in girls (PFOS, PFHpS, PFDA) and boys (PFDA, PFNA) were observed, showing larger mean age differences for the combined puberty indicator in the middle tertile [girls: PFOS: -3:73 mo, 95% confidence interval (CI): -6:59, -0:87; PFHpS: -4:92 mo, 95% CI: -11:68, 1.85; PFDA: -3:60 mo, 95% CI: -9:03, 1.83; and boys: PFNA: 4.45 mo, 95% CI: -1:30, 10.21; PFDA: 4.59 mo, 95% CI: -0:93, 10.11] than in the highest tertile with the lowest as reference. CONCLUSIONS: Our population-based cohort study suggests sex-specific associations of altered pubertal development with prenatal exposure to PFASs. These findings are novel, and replication is needed. © 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Metadata from on-going site investigations at U.S. Air Force sites impacted by Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF) were used to evaluate primary factors that affect transport of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) within source zones. Soil-to-groundwater ratios (γ Soil-GW ) were calculated for each site and PFAS as an empirical transport metric and regressed against select soil chemical and physical properties, as well as relevant interactions thereof, using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Total organic carbon and percent total clay content were significant covariates and best fit log-transformed γ Soil-GW with a parallel lines model. Regression parameters were used to derive apparent K OC estimates for 15 perfluoroalkyl acids, perfluorooctane sulfonamide, and the 6:2 and 8:2 fluorotelomer sulfonates, which were bimodal where significant differences were primarily observed between PFAS with fewer than 8 perfluorinated carbons (including perfluorooctoanoic acid; PFOA) and those with 8 or more (including perfluorooctane sulfonate; PFOS). Surprisingly, clay content was observed with a negative slope (i.e., γ Soil-GW decreased with increasing clay content), which may reflect greater retardation at more permeable sites due to air-water interfacial partitioning. Further analysis demonstrated that γ Soil-GW is also affected by the degree of flushing in a way that suggests mass transfer (as opposed to hysteretic desorption) primarily controls mass discharge at poorly flushed sites. Overall, this meta-analysis demonstrates that PFAS retention in soil is significant, but depends on a combination of fundamental partitioning mechanisms that may not be predictable in all cases based on transport models that assume an equilibrium condition. © 2018},

There are also significant variations in the extraction method employed from the use of direct injection, liquid-liquid extraction to solid-phase extraction options, with little apparent difference in limits of detection. Chromatography was largely based on the use of C18-bonded columns; however both C8- and phenyl-bonded columns were used to affect separation. Modern-day tandem mass spectrometers are capable of exceptional sensitivity enabling detection of sub-nanogram per milliliter amounts in urine, which provide for longer detection times in the urine of suspected drug-facilitated assaults.

The Al-MCM-41 was characterized using SAXRD. Morphology of Al-MCM-41 surface was analyzed using TEM. The metals content were measured using XPS. The performance of Al-MCM-41 to adsorb and desorb nitrogen was monitored by GSA using BET model. The acidity of Al-MCM-41 was analyzed by FTIR by pyridine absorption method. Al-MCM-41 catalyst was used to convert polypropylene plastic waste in 200 mL catalytic convertion reactor. The Al-MCM-41 catalyst was used for three times and coded as sample A, B, and C. The results showed that sample A, B, and C produce hydrocarbon fraction (C8-C12) liquid fuel with a composition of 92.76; 91.92; and 90.58%, respectively. The repeated use of the catalyst causes a decrease in the composition of the hydrocarbon fraction (C8-C12) due to decrease of catalyst performance as observed by a TON (Turn Over Number) value which increased from 0.075%/gram to 0.156%/gram. Based on physical test i.e. boiling point, flash point, density, viscosity, and calorific value, it was proved that hydrocarbon fuels A, B and C have characteristics that in accordance with standard, premium gasoline, as specified in SNI 06-3506- 1994 and HIBER11Z international standards issued by Hibernia Petroleum Canada in 2016. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Environmental protection is one of the most important challenges for the humankind. Increasing number of emerging pollutants resulting from industrial/human-made activities represents a serious menace to the ecological and environmental equilibrium. Industrial dyes, endocrine disrupters, pesticides, phenols and halogenated phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and other xenobiotics are among the top priority environmental pollutants. Some classical remediation approaches including physical, chemical and biological are being employed, but are ineffective in cleaning the environment. Enzyme-catalyzed transformation reactions are gearing accelerating attention in this context as potential alternatives to classical chemical methods. Peroxidases are catalysts able to decontaminate an array of toxic compounds by a free radical mechanism resulting in oxidized or depolymerized products along with a significant toxicity reduction. Admittedly, enzymatic catalysis offers the hallmark of high chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity and superior catalytic efficiency under given reaction environment. Moreover, enzymes are considered more benign, socially acceptable and greener production routes since derived from the renewable and sustainable feedstock. Regardless of their versatility and potential use in environmental processes, several limitations, such as heterologous production, catalytic stability, and redox potential should be overcome to implement peroxidases at large-scale transformation and bio-elimination of recalcitrant pollutants. In this article, a critical review of the transformation of different types of hazardous pollutants by peroxidases, with special reference to the proposed reaction mechanisms of several dyes is presented. Following that major challenges for industrial and environmental applications of peroxidases are also discussed. Towards the end, the information is also given on miscellaneous applications of peroxidases, concluding remarks and outlook. © 2018},

abstract={Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is the term used to describe neurobehavioral disorders associated with prenatal alcohol exposure ranging from the most severe Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) with facial dysmorphology, through partial Fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS) to alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). Many of the cognitive impairments associated with FASD are similar to those seen in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autistic Spectrum Disorders and other such conditions. There are considerable problems in diagnosing FASD and evidence of more than minimal exposure to ethanol during pregnancy is an important criterion. Information on the mother's alcohol consumption during pregnancy may not be available, or may be inaccurate. Furthermore, approximately half of children affected by FASD may not exhibit signs of CNS dysfunction until they are preschool or school-age when the child and the mother may have become separated. Early accurate differential diagnosis would enable the most effective treatments to be used. Ideally biomarkers would be identified which would enable confirmation of prenatal alcohol exposure. The use of meconium as an accessible fetal source of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulfate (EtS) is frequently considered, but this is only applicable for the first few days of the neonate's life. The use of neonatal blood phosphatidylethanol (PEth) has also been discussed, but again the longevity of this biomarker is short. More recently results from animal studies of neonatal plasma microRNA biomarkers and changes to histone modifications have provided new opportunities, and DNA methylation has been suggested as a potential biomarker. Our own work suggests that prenatal alcohol exposure may induce long-lived changes in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and brain aminopeptidase activity which may be reflected in changes in plasma or urine. In the light of the evidence that many fetuses are exposed to alcohol but do not exhibit any degree of FASD, this review will assess the evidence of reliability of emerging enduring markers of prenatal alcohol exposure and explore whether they correlate only with prenatal alcohol exposure or also with FASD. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={Research on the environment, health, and well-being nexus (EHWB) is shifting from a silo toward a systemic approach that includes the socio-economic context. To disentangle further the complex interplay between the socio-exposome and internal chemical exposure, we performed a meta-analysis of human biomonitoring (HBM) studies with internal exposure data on per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and detailed information on risk factors, including descriptors of socio-economic status (SES) of the study population. PFASs are persistent in nature, and some have endocrine-disrupting properties. Individual studies have shown that HBM biomarker concentrations of PFASs generally increase with SES indicators, e.g., for income. Based on a meta-analysis (five studies) of the associations between PFASs and SES indicators, the magnitude of the association could be estimated. For the SES indicator income, changes in income were expressed by a factor change, which was corrected by the Gini coefficient to take into account the differences in income categories between studies, and the income range between countries. For the SES indicator education, we had to conclude that descriptors (<college, x years of study, etc.) differed too widely between studies to perform a meta-analysis. Therefore, the use of the uniform ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education) is recommended in future studies. The meta-analysis showed that a higher income is associated with a higher internal exposure to PFASs (PFOS or perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, PFOA or perfluorooctanoic acid, PFNA or perfluorononanoic acid, PFHxS or perfluorohexane sulfonate). This is opposite to the environmental justice hypothesis, referring to an inequitable distribution of detrimental environmental effects toward poor and minority communities by a practice or policy. With a doubling of the income, internal exposure increased on average by 10%–14%. Possible explanations for this difference are given, e.g., underlying differences in diet. However, other sources can also contribute, and the exact causes of SES-related differences in PFAS concentrations remain unclear. Studies are needed that include social descriptors together with lifestyle and dietary information as explanatory variables for internal chemical exposure levels. This will help clarify the underlying factors that link SES with inequity to environmental exposures, and will raise awareness and knowledge to strengthen the capacities of people and communities to advocate chemical exposure reduction in order to reduce this health inequity. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Chirality is a critical topic in the medicinal and agrochemical fields. One quarter of all agrochemicals was chiral in 1996, and this proportion has increased remarkably with the introduction of new compounds over time. Despite scientists have made great efforts to probe the enantiomeric selectivity of chiral chemicals in the environment since early 1990s, the different behaviours of individual enantiomers in biologically mediated processes are still unclear. In the present review, we highlight state-of-the-knowledge on the stereoselective biotransformation and accumulation of chiral contaminants in organisms ranging from invertebrates to humans. Chiral insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pharmaceuticals, flame retardants hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are all included in the target compounds. Key findings included: a) Changes in the enantiomeric fractions in vitro and in vivo models revealed that enantioselectivity commonly occurs in biotransformation and bioaccumulation. b) Emerging contaminants have become more important in the field of enantioselectivity together with their metabolites in biological transformation process. c) Chiral signatures have also been regarded as powerful tools for tracking pollution sources when the contribution of precursor is unknown. Future studies are needed in order to understand not only preliminary enrichment results but also detailed molecular mechanisms in diverse models to comprehensively understand the behaviours of chiral compounds. This paper provided a critical review of the enantioselective biotransformation and bioaccumulation of chiral contaminants from in vitro and in vivo studies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Although N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone (AHL) based quorum sensing (QS) phenomenon has been observed in mature anaerobic granules, the biological role of AHL-based QS system in anaerobic granulation process remains unexplored. For the first time, a long-term anaerobic bioreactor was operated for 168 days to investigate the biological role of AHL in the granulation process which was divided into three phases (phase I: floccular, phase II: granulation, phase III: maturation). Two different AHLs including C8-HSL and C10-HSL were characterized at nanogram levels. The AHL level was elevated over 20-fold and strongly positively correlated with extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production and sludge particle size during phase I-II. Exogenous addition of AHL to the floccular sludge also resulted in significantly increased EPS production. Metadata analysis suggested that the granulation process was accompanied by an increase in the abundance of QS-relevant microorganisms. The strong relationships (R > 0.9233, p < 0.01) among AHL concentrations, EPS (except loosely bound EPS), granulation and community variation indicated that AHL-mediated QS played an important role in coordinating community level behaviors associated with granulation, potentially through the regulation of EPS production and composition. This study gives a deep insight into the underlying QS-relevant mechanism of anaerobic granulation process. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={The presence of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in aquatic environments is a cause of concern, due to their toxicity, possible ecological impact and adverse effects in man. The release of these pollutants into receiving water bodies occurs primarily through the discharge of untreated wastewater and industrial effluents. Consequently, there is a need to remediate wastewater containing these compounds before its discharge. In this review, the occurrence of PFAAs in water streams is reviewed, with the aim of providing in-depth information on the harmful effects arising through exposure to these pollutants by both man and the environment. One viable strategy for the removal of PFAAs from wastewaters is adsorption. This technique is discussed in relation to a number of conventional adsorbents and they are compared with the behaviour of a more effective adsorbent, namely, carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In particular, various functionalization strategies can increase the efficiency of CNTs for the removal of PFAAs. Sorption of PFAAs onto CNTs demonstrates good removal efficiencies and equilibrium is attained faster than with conventional adsorbents. This is attributed to the inherent properties of CNTs, such as large surface area/porosity, and the ease with which new functional groups are introduced onto the walls of the tubes. The adsorption mechanism of PFAAs is primarily enhanced through electrostatic interactions; however, other intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions and ion-exchange, also play a role. This review aims at providing information on the occurrence and fate of PFAAs and the interactions involved in their removal from aqueous solutions by CNTs. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Insulin resistance (IR) predisposes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease but its causes are incompletely understood. Metabolic challenges like the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) can reveal pathogenic mechanisms. We aimed to discover associations of IR with metabolite trajectories during OGTT. In 470 non-diabetic men (age 70.6 ± 0.6 years), plasma samples obtained at 0, 30 and 120 minutes during an OGTT were analyzed by untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics. IR was assessed with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp method. We applied age-adjusted linear regression to identify metabolites whose concentration change was related to IR. Nine trajectories, including monounsaturated fatty acids, lysophosphatidylethanolamines and a bile acid, were significantly associated with IR, with the strongest associations observed for medium-chain acylcarnitines C10 and C12, and no associations with L-carnitine or C2-, C8-, C14- or C16-carnitine. Concentrations of C10- and C12-carnitine decreased during OGTT with a blunted decline in participants with worse insulin resistance. Associations persisted after adjustment for obesity, fasting insulin and fasting glucose. In mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to different acylcarnitines, we observed blunted insulin-stimulated glucose uptake after treatment with C10- or C12-carnitine. In conclusion, our results identify medium-chain acylcarnitines as possible contributors to IR. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={The main goal of this paper is to critically review current microkinetics available for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) modelling, in order to propose the best way to follow this set of complex reactions; therefore a microkinetic model was developed for FTS, accomplishing surface chemistry, heterogeneous kinetics, and single-event previous development for Co-based catalysts. Model starts simulating CO activation on catalyst surface, and then formation of methane, ethane and subsequent chain growth. Reaction rates were derived following the formalism of Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW); surface steps were proposed in consequence of feasibility. Chain growth was modelled by single-event steps, taking into account geometrical conformation explicitly. Number of growth steps of 1-olefins was rectified as requiring one more active site than mechanisms proposed previously; it was found that formation of these olefins exhibits a fast drop in chain growth; this phenomenon is explained in terms of probable geometrical conformations that lead to the number of single events. Experimental results in literature about isothermal synthesis of hydrocarbons in the gasoline range were simulated in a fixed-bed laboratory reactor; thermodynamic consistency was derived from chemical equilibrium over all reactions occurring during FTS. Equilibrium constants were evaluated as function of Gibbs free energy, and partial pressures of reactants and products. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={Motivation Transcriptomics and proteomics data have been integrated into constraint-based models to influence flux predictions. However, it has been reported recently for Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that model predictions from parsimonious flux balance analysis (pFBA), which does not use expression data, are as good or better than predictions from various algorithms that integrate transcriptomics or proteomics data into constraint-based models. Results In this paper, we describe a novel constraint-based method called Linear Bound Flux Balance Analysis (LBFBA), which uses expression data (either transcriptomic or proteomic) to predict metabolic fluxes. The method uses expression data to place soft constraints on individual fluxes, which can be violated. Parameters in the soft constraints are first estimated from a training expression and flux dataset before being used to predict fluxes from expression data in other conditions. We applied LBFBA to E.coli and S.cerevisiae datasets and found that LBFBA predictions were more accurate than pFBA predictions, with average normalized errors roughly half of those from pFBA. For the first time, we demonstrate a computational method that integrates expression data into constraint-based models and improves quantitative flux predictions over pFBA.

abstract={Background: Various synthetic materials are used in neurosurgery and left in place intentionally during surgery for several purposes such as hemostasis, dural closure, or cranioplasty. Although leaving such substances in surgical sites is considered safe, in general, foreign body granuloma may occur months or years after intracranial surgery. Thus, far relatively little is known about treatment and outcome of such lesions. Methods: A systematic review of 3466 histopathological examinations after cranial surgeries achieved over a 13-year period was performed. After excluding patients with Teflon granulomas or infection, a total of 12 patients with foreign body granulomas induced by synthetic material used in a prior surgery were identified. Patient records, imaging studies, and histopathological data were analyzed. Furthermore, postoperative outcome was assessed. Results: Mean age at the second surgery was 51 years (range, 11–68 years). The median time between the primary and the secondary surgery was 13 months (range, 1–545 months). Eight patients (75%) presented with signs and symptoms related to the foreign body granulomas. Total resection of the foreign body granulomas was performed in all patients. The granulomas were induced by oxidized cellulose polymer (n = 6), suture material (n = 3), Gelfoam (n = 1), methylmethacrylate (n = 1), and bone wax (n = 1). The mean postoperative follow-up time was 54 months (range 1–137 months). There was symptomatic improvement in all instances. Imaging studies did not demonstrate any recurrence. Conclusion: Despite its rarity, foreign body granuloma should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of intracranial mass lesions especially in cases of suspected tumor recurrence after prior surgery. The pathogenesis of foreign body granuloma still needs further clarification. Our study demonstrates that they have good prognosis after surgical removal. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Retinal toxicity/biocompatibility of medical devices in direct contact with the retina is an important subject for clinicians and scientists. As these effects are not very frequent, there is also a relative lack of information for many clinicians. The past has taught us multiple times that there is a significant safety problem associated with severe loss of vision in affected patients. In this review, we want to classify medical products that are used in the back of the eye, describe recent examples of toxicity, critically reflect on the regulations that exist and suggest improvements that can be done to ensure patient safety without hindering innovation. Methods: Critical review of the recent papers and personal experience of the authors in this issue. Medical devices used in the back of the eye and recent examples of toxicity are described, regulations that exist are critically reflected and improvements suggested that can ensure patient safety without hindering innovation. Results: There is clear evidence of toxicity after intraocular surgery in any category. Some cytotoxic indirect methods have failed in detecting this toxicity. Some ISO rules do not seem appropriate. Postmarketing safety is missing. There is little data on this issue. Conclusions: The absence of a clear regulation of the production, purification and evaluation of the toxic effects of the medical devices supposes the possibility that products are not sufficiently safe to obtain the CE mark. © 2018 S.

abstract={Amide bonds at the proline nitrogen are particularly susceptible to rotation, affording cis and trans isomers. Installation of a stereochemically defined electron-withdrawing fluorine atom or fluorinated groups has the power to influence the cis-trans conformational preferences of the amide bond in X-(F)Pro (where X = any other amino acid). Advantageously, this also provides a sensitive reporter for 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of protein conformation, interactions, and dynamics. We deliberately use the term "fluorinated prolines" as an all-encompassing term to describe proline analogues containing one or more fluorine atoms and to avoid confusion with the more well-known 4-fluoroprolines. This review presents a critical discussion of the growing repertoire of fluorinated prolines that have been described and, importantly, provides a comparison of their uses and relative influence on amide-bond conformation and discusses the significant potential of using 19F NMR as a tool to probe conformational changes in polypeptides. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The present study focuses on the risk rankings of different contaminants from Daling River in Liaoning Province, China, for categorizing the environmental risk levels in the river. Eighteen surface water samples were collected from Daling River, which has been polluted by the surrounding fluorine industries for years. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and heavy metals were analyzed, and relevant eco-toxicity data obtained from literatures were considered. The median concentrations of PFOS and PFOA were observed as 0.77-3.57 ng•L -1 and 82.93-344 ng•L -1 , respectively, which were lower than the standard limits of the United Kingdom. The concentrations of heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were found to be lower than level Ⅳ of the Chinese national environmental quality standards for surface water. The maximum concentrations of mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As) were higher than the standard level Ⅲ. The environmental risks ranged from 1.42×10 -6 to 2.3×10 -2 . The order of the risks by potential environmental contaminants was Cu&gt;Zn&gt;As&gt;p,p'-DDE&gt;p,p'-DDT&gt;Cd&gt;Pb&gt;Hg&gt;PFOA&gt; γ-HCH&gt;Cr&gt;Ni&gt;α-HCH&gt;PFOS. The present findings revealed that the environmental risks of PFOS and PFOA were relatively low and these were not taken as priority contaminants, but the accumulation risks could not be overlooked for a long time. Among the contaminants, copper (Cu) was the priority contaminant of Daling River. Hence, necessary measures are recommended to reduce the potential effects of contaminants on the environment. © 2018, Science Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={Background and objectives Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large group of manufactured nonbiodegradable compounds. Despite increasing awareness as global pollutants, the impact of PFAS exposure on human health is not well understood, and there are growing concerns for adverse effects on kidney function. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review to summarize and identify gaps in the understanding between PFAS exposure and kidney health. Design, setting, participants, & measurements We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO Global Health, World Health Organization Global Index, and Web of Science for studies published from 1990 to 2018. We included studies on the epidemiology, pharmacokinetics, or toxicology of PFAS exposure and kidney-related health, including clinical, histologic, molecular, and metabolic outcomes related to kidney disease, or outcomes related to the pharmacokinetic role of the kidneys. Results We identified 74 studies, including 21 epidemiologic, 13 pharmacokinetic, and 40 toxicological studies. Three population-based epidemiologic studies demonstrated associations between PFAS exposure and lower kidney function. Along with toxicology studies (n=10) showing tubular histologic and cellular changes from PFAS exposure, pharmacokinetic studies (n=5) demonstrated the kidneys were major routes of elimination, with active proximal tubule transport. In several studies (n=17), PFAS exposure altered several pathways linked to kidney disease, including oxidative stress pathways, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor pathways, NF-E2– related factor 2 pathways, partial epithelial mesenchymal transition, and enhanced endothelial permeability through actin filament modeling. Conclusions A growing body of evidence portends PFASs are emerging environmental threats to kidney health; yet several important gaps in our understanding still exist. © 2018 by the American Society of Nephrology.},

abstract={Some articles have examined perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure in early life in relation to risk of childhood adiposity. Nevertheless, the results from epidemiological studies exploring the associations remain inconsistent and contradictory. We thus conducted an analysis of data currently available to examine the association between PFOA exposure in early life and risk of childhood adiposity. The PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify studies that examined the impact of PFOA exposure in early life on childhood adiposity. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to pool the statistical estimates. We identified ten prospective cohort studies comprising 6076 participants with PFOA exposure. The overall effect size (relative risk or odds ratio) for childhood overweight was 1.25 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.50; I2 = 40.5%). In addition, exposure to PFOA in early life increased the z-score of childhood body mass index (β = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.17; I2 = 27.9%). Accordingly, exposure to PFOA in early life is associated with an increased risk for childhood adiposity. Further research is needed to verify these findings and to shed light on the molecular mechanism of PFOA in adiposity. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The presence of emerging pollutants in the aquatic environment in relatively small concentrations and the fact that they cannot be removed by conventional water/wastewater treatment processes bring new challenges in terms of adequate selection of technologies from the technical, economical and environmental points of view. Generally, literature discusses emerging pollutants’ removal at significant concentrations (such as those in wastewater), while few studies consider their low concentrations occurring in raw water. This study presents a comprehensive review of the research efforts related to the occurrence, fate, health effects and impacts of emerging pollutants on advanced drinking water treatment and the environmental performance evaluation of different technological options, with a focus on pilot and full-scale installations. All presented case studies consider pollutants removed, process conditions and removal efficiencies, thus making possible comparisons between membrane processes, advanced oxidation processes and adsorption on activated carbon and other materials. The study is completed by an analysis of the environmental assessment instruments (life cycle assessment, carbon, water footprints, other type of assessments) that may be used for selecting sustainable advanced drinking water treatment processes able to remove emerging pollutants. This paper critically reviews the main research topics concerning emerging pollutants: classification, legislative framework, up-to-date removal processes and their environmental performances assessment, to offer a comprehensive analysis of the strategic issues that may constitute future research directions for sustainable water supply. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the findings from the systematic review were not clear when observational studies were also included. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The primary endpoints were recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The secondary outcomes were all-cause death, atrial fibrillation (AF), and hemorrhagic events. Results: Five randomized trials and fourteen observational studies (6301 participants) were eligible. PFO closure was superior to medical therapy for stroke prevention risk ratios ([RR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24-0.60), but showed increased risk of AF (RR, 4.96; 95% CI, 2.31-10.7). There was no significant difference in TIA recurrence, death, and hemorrhagic events. Subgroup analyses showed that patients with factors such as substantial residual shunt, the presence of atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), male, and age <45 years had a lower risk of recurrent stroke when PFOs were closed. Conclusions: In patients with cryptogenic stroke, PFO closure does appeared to be superior to medical therapy in stroke prevention, with an increased incidence of AF. Male, age <45 years, substantial residual shunt, and the history of ASA are the factors that will predict the benefit when PFO is closed. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Background: Patients with history of cryptogenic stroke are more likely to have a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and should be managed with antithrombotic agents, while the alternative option is percutaneous closure of PFOs. Our aim was to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing percutaneous closure vs. medical treatment for patients with PFO and prior cryptogenic stroke. Methods: Medline, Scopus and Cochrane databases were reviewed. A random-effect model meta-analysis was used and I-square was utilized to assess the heterogeneity. New ischemic stroke was defined as the primary endpoint. A sensitivity analysis was performed for Amplatzer device. Subgroup analyses were performed for different patient and PFO characteristics for the composite endpoints as defined by the included RCTs. Results: In total of 3440 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Closure devices were superior to medical therapy for prevention of recurrent ischemic strokes (HR = 0.29; CI: 0.02–0.56), but were associated with increased risk of new onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (RR = 4.67; CI: 2.22–9.81). However, in the sensitivity analysis for Amplatzer device, there was no difference between the two groups in new onset of atrial arrhythmias. Closure devices were superior across all different subgroups when compared to medical treatment with the exception of patients with a small shunt. Conclusion: This meta-analysis shows that closure devices for patients with PFO and history of cryptogenic stroke can significantly decrease the risk of a new ischemic stroke. The use of Amplatzer device was not associated with increased risk of newly diagnosed atrial arrhythmias. © 2018},

abstract={Identification of the direct molecular targets of environmental pollutants is of great importance for toxicity mechanism studies. Despite numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the toxicity mechanism of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), their direct-binding protein targets which trigger downstream toxicity effects remain largely unknown. Herein, we present a systematic chemical proteomic study to profile the target proteins of PFCs by taking PFOA as a representative. Considering its electrophilicity, PFOA could preferentially bind to reactive cysteine-containing proteins. Therefore, two complementary cysteine-targeting probes, iodoacetamide alkyne (IAA) and ethynyl benziodoxolone azide (EBX), were selected to enrich the putative target proteins in the absence or presence of PFOA. Quantitative proteomic analysis of the enriched proteins identified Acaca and Acacb as novel target proteins of PFOA. We then applied parallel reaction monitoring (PRM)-based targeted proteomics study combined with thermal shift assay-based chemical proteomics to verify Acaca and Acacb as bona fide binding targets. These findings afford a plausible explanation for the PFOA-induced liver toxicity, especially regarding abnormal fatty acid metabolism that was validated by targeted metabolomics analysis. The present study documents an integrative chemical proteomics-metabolomics platform that facilitates the authentic identification of proteins that are targeted by small molecules and its potential to be applied for toxicity mechanism studies of environmental pollutants. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Organochlorines, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), are persistent organic pollutants that both bioaccumulate and biomagnify within marine food webs. These legacy pollutants are known endocrine disruptors and have been reported to have adverse effects on endocrine, reproductive, and immune functions in humans, laboratory animals, and wildlife. This chapter will review evidence of pollutant-mediated effects on the reproductive system in cetaceans from exposure to PCBs and DDT. In addition, an assessment of reproductive failure and reproductive dysfunction was undertaken on stranded and bycaught female common dolphins from the Northeast Atlantic, and their association with exposure to PCBs was investigated. Within the sample, 16.8% (18 out of 107) of females presented with reproductive system pathologies that were associated with higher blubber SPCB lw concentrations, above the threshold for the onset of adverse health effects in marine mammals. Cases of reproductive failure were also reported that may be linked to exposure to these endocrine-disrupting chemicals. The continued exposure to legacy pollutants, and new emerging pollutants, raises concerns about the current and future population-level pollutant effects on Northeast Atlantic common dolphins. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Background: Traumatic brachial plexus injury (BPI) can result in debilitating sequelae of the upper extremity. Presently, therapeutic decisions are based on the mechanism of injury, serial physical examination, electromyography, nerve conduction, and imaging studies. While magnetic resonance imaging is the current imaging modality of choice for BPI, ultrasound is a promising newcomer that is inexpensive, accessible, and available at point of care. Objective: To evaluate ultrasound as a diagnostic tool in the assessment of traumatic adult BPI through a systematic review. Methods: An electronic literature search was completed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases up to July 2016. Two independent reviewers completed the screening and data extraction. Methodological quality of studies was evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Statistical analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivities and study heterogeneity. Results: Seven studies were included. Four studies compared the detection of pre- and postganglionic lesions at different levels (C5-T1) to surgical exploration as the reference standard. Sensitivity of lesion detectionwas greater in the upper and middle spinal nerves: C5 (93%, confidence interval [CI] = 78%-100%), C6 (94%, CI = 82%-100%), and C7 (95%, CI = 86%-100%) than in the lower: C8 (71%, CI = 36%-95%) and T1 (56%, CI = 29%-81%). Conclusion: Individual studies demonstrate ultrasound as an effective diagnostic tool for traumatic adult BPI. Sensitivity of lesion detection was noted to be greater in the upper and middle (C5-C7) than in the lower spinal nerves (C8, T1). Further standardized studies should be performed to confirm the utility of ultrasound in the diagnosis of traumatic adult BPI. Copyright © 2017 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.},

abstract={Bisphenol A (BPA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and tributyltin (TBT) are emerging endocrine disruptors (EDCs) with still poorly defined mechanisms of toxicity and metabolic effects in aquatic organisms. We used an untargeted liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) metabolomic approach to study the effects of sub-lethal doses of these three EDCs on the metabolic profiles of zebrafish embryos exposed from 48 to 120 hpf (hours post fertilization). Advanced chemometric data analysis methods were used to reveal effects on the subjacent regulatory pathways. EDC treatments induced changes in concentrations of about 50 metabolites for TBT and BPA, and of 25 metabolites for PFOS. The analysis of the corresponding metabolic changes suggested the presence of similar underlying zebrafish responses to BPA, TBT and PFOS affecting the metabolism of glycerophospholipids, amino acids, purines and 2-oxocarboxylic acids. We related the changes in glycerophospholipid metabolism to alterations in absorption of the yolk sack, the main source of nutrients (including lipids) for the developing embryo, linking the molecular markers with adverse phenotypic effects. We propose a general mode of action for all three chemical compounds, probably related to their already described interaction with the PPAR/RXR complex, combined with specific effects on different signaling pathways resulting in particular alterations in the zebrafish embryos metabolism. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Contamination of the aquatic environment caused by multiple human activities may exert a negative impact on all living organisms. Several contaminants of emerging concern such as personal care products (PCPs) are continuously released into the aquatic environment where they are biologically active and persistent. This work reviews the current knowledge, provided by papers published after 2010 and indexed by SciFinder, Scopus, and Google search engines, about the determination and occurrence of PCPs in marine biota. Analytical methodologies have been critically reviewed, emphasizing the importance of green and high-throughput approaches and focusing the discussion on the complexity of the solute-matrix interaction in the extraction step, as well as the matrix effect in the instrumental determination. Finally, the worldwide distribution of PCPs is surveyed, taking into account the concentrations found in the same organism in different marine environments. Differences among various world areas have been highlighted, evidencing some critical aspects from an environmental point of view. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Hypertension is an increasingly serious public-health challenge worldwide. The traditional blood pressure measurement method could easily and reliably detect blood pressure. However, the delayed symptom onset may influence the screening of essential hypertension (EH). In addition, EH is significantly associated to cardiovascular disease, stroke and kidney disease. Hence, it is urgent to define associated biomarkers with early diagnosis potential for EH. A dried blood spot method integrated with direct infusion mass spectrometry (MS) metabolomic analysis was applied for the detection of metabolites toward 87 EH patients and 91 healthy controls (HC). Multiple algorithms were run on training set (62 EH and 64 HC) for selecting differential metabolites as potential biomarkers. A test set (25 EH and 27 HC) was used to verify and evaluate selected potential biomarkers. A novel blood biomarker model based on Gly, Orn, C10, Orn/Cit, Phe/Tyr, and C5-OH/C8 exhibited potential to differentiate EH patients from HC individuals, with a sensitivity of 0.8400 and a specificity of 0.8889 in test set. The metabolomic analysis of EH is beneficial to the definition of disease-associated biomarkers and the development of new diagnostic approaches. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 70(8):777–785, 2018. © 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology},

abstract={Wastewater is a complex matrix containing a wide range of chemical and biological markers of human activity. Relating concentrations of these “waste” materials in wastewater influent streams to population-scale use, consumption, or rates of exposure, can provide important qualitative or quantitative information on the activity of inhabitants within a given wastewater catchment. Many publications in this field of study have focussed on the usage of pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, tobacco and alcohol. However, many other potential applications are emerging which can contribute useful knowledge on human health, exposure to industrial chemicals, infectious diseases or pathogens and antibiotic resistance. This review summarises the established wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) biomarkers, and presents a critical review of the current capabilities of WBE. We further discuss possible future strategies and challenges anticipated in analysing wastewater to measure chemical markers of population health as well as biological markers of microbial exposure and disease. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The selective activation of one carbon-fluorine bond in polyfluorinated aromatic molecules or in trifluoromethyl-containing substrates offers the possibility of accessing unique fluorine-containing molecules, which are difficult to obtain by other synthetic pathways. Among various metals, which can undergo C-F activation, lanthanides (Ln) are good candidates as they form strong Ln-F bonds. Lanthanide metals are strong reducing agents with a redox potential Ln3+/Ln of approximately-2.3 V, which is comparable to the value of the Mg2+/Mg redox couple. In addition, lanthanide metals display a promising functional group tolerance and their reactivity can vary along the lanthanide series, making them suitable reagents for fine-tuning reaction conditions in organic and organometallic transformations. However, due to their oxophilicity, lanthanides react readily with oxygen and water and therefore require special conditions for storage, handling, preparation, and activation. These factors have limited a more widespread use in organic synthesis. We herein present how dysprosium metal-and by analogy all lanthanide metals-can be freshly prepared under anhydrous conditions using glovebox and Schlenk techniques. The freshly filed metal, in combination with aluminum chloride, initiates the selective C-F activation in trifluoromethylated benzofulvenes. The resulting reaction intermediates react with nitroalkenes to obtain a new family of difluoroalkenes. © 2018 Journal of Visualized Experiments.},

abstract={Nanostructure imaging mass spectrometry (NIMS) with fluorinated gold nanoparticles (f-AuNPs) is a nanoparticle assisted laser desorption/ionization approach that requires low laser energy and has demonstrated high sensitivity. Here we describe NIMS with f-AuNPs for the comprehensive analysis of metabolites in biological tissues. F-AuNPs assist in desorption/ionization by laser-induced release of the fluorocarbon chains with minimal background noise. Since the energy barrier required to release the fluorocarbons from the AuNPs is minimal, the energy of the laser is maintained in the low μJ/pulse range, thus limiting metabolite in-source fragmentation. Electron microscopy analysis of tissue samples after f-AuNP NIMS shows a distinct "raising" of the surface as compared to matrix assisted laser desorption ionization ablation, indicative of a gentle desorption mechanism aiding in the generation of intact molecular ions. Moreover, the use of perfluorohexane to distribute the f-AuNPs on the tissue creates a hydrophobic environment minimizing metabolite solubilization and spatial dislocation. The transfer of the energy from the incident laser to the analytes through the release of the fluorocarbon chains similarly enhances the desorption/ionization of metabolites of different chemical nature, resulting in heterogeneous metabolome coverage. We performed the approach in a comparative study of the colon of mice exposed to three different diets. F-AuNP NIMS allows the direct detection of carbohydrates, lipids, bile acids, sulfur metabolites, amino acids, nucleotide precursors as well as other small molecules of varied biological origins. Ultimately, the diversified molecular coverage obtained provides a broad picture of a tissue's metabolic organization. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Transformation of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) precursors (PreFOSs) is considered an additional source of PFOS in the environment and biota. A PreFOSs-degrading bacterium PF1, which was able to utilize PreFOSs as the sole carbon and energy source for growth, was isolated from contaminated soil collected from the surroundings of a fluoride factory. According to its morphology and 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis, strain PF1 was identified as Hyphomicrobium sp. The degradation rates of perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA) and N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide (N-EtFOSA) by PF1 were 14.6% and 8.2% (30℃; pH=7.0-7.2), respectively, whereas PF1 was unable to degrade PFOS. PFOSA could be biodegraded to PFOS. N-EtFOSA could be biodegraded to perfluorooctane sulfonamide acetic acid (FOSAA), PFOSA, and PFOS; PFOS was the predominant metabolite. Based on the above analysis, the proposed metabolic pathway of PFOSA by strain PF1 is deamination to form PFOS. Two possible degradation pathways are proposed for N-EtFOSA: ① deethylation of N-EtFOSA to produce PFOSA, followed by deamination to form PFOS, and ②oxidation of N-EtFOSA to FOSAA followed by sequential dealkylation to produce PFOSA, and then transformation to PFOS by deamination. © 2018, Science Press.

abstract={Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a persistent organic pollutant in the environment with serious health risks including endocrine-disrupting characteristics, immunotoxicity, and causing developmental defects. The photocatalytic deposition has proven to be an inexpensive, effective, and sustainable technology for the removal of PFOA in the aqueous phase. Most investigations are conducted in ultrapure water at concentrations higher than those detected in actual water systems. A few studies deal with the toxicity of treated water. In this research, the photocatalytic degradation of PFOA, including photo-oxidative and photo-reductive degradation, is reviewed comprehensively. Compared to photo-oxidation, photo-reduction is more suitable for PFOA removal since it favors defluorination of PFOA and complete mineralization. We used graphene oxide/TiO2 nanotubes array for photocatalytic degradation of PFOA. The effects of key parameters on the photocatalytic degradation and defluorination processes of PFOA, such as initial PFOA concentration, initial pH of the solution, an initial temperature of the solution, and external bias constant potential, are addressed. We observed that at pH 3 the PFOA degradation was around 83% in 4 h, and at 75 °C almost complete PFOA degradation was observed in 2.5 h. In photoelectrocatalytic process at 2.0 V external bias 97% of PFOA was degraded in 4 h. The mechanisms of the PFOA photodegradation process are also discussed in detail. © 2018},

The review summarises the literature on both cross-sectional and prospective studies in humans, as well as experimental in vivo and in vitro studies. The findings were subjected to evidence grading according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) classification. We found >40 cross-sectional and seven prospective studies regarding EDCs and risk of diabetes. Taken together, there is moderate evidence for a relationship between exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE), a metabolite of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, and diabetes development. Regarding polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), it is likely that the rodent models used are not appropriate, and therefore the evidence is poorer than for p,p′-DDE. For other EDCs, such as bisphenol A, phthalates and perfluorinated chemicals, the evidence is scarce, since very few prospective studies exist. Brominated flame retardants do not seem to be associated with a disturbed glucose tolerance. Thus, evidence is accumulating that EDCs might be involved in diabetes development. Best evidence exists for p,p′-DDE. For other chemicals, both prospective studies and supporting animal data are still lacking. © 2018, The Author(s).},

AHLs of N-[(RS)-3-Hydroxybutyryl]-L-homoserine lactone, N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C6-HSL) and N-octanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C8-HSL) were detected in both reactors. C6-HSL and C8-HSL were also detected in batch experiments, especially with stimulated nitrite oxidizing bacteria activities. Quorum sensing affected biofilm formation mainly through the regulation of extracellular protein production. By the metagenomics analysis, many identified genera and species could participate in quorum sensing, quorum quenching and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production. A high quorum quenching activity was obtained in SBBR_CN, whereas a high quorum sensing activity in SBBR_N. Nitrosomonas-like ammonia oxidizing bacteria, Nitrospira-like nitrite oxidizing bacteria and Comammox harbored genes for AHL synthesis and EPS production. Possible relationships among AHLs synthesis, biofilm formation and nitrifiers activity were proposed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Lakes are an important source of freshwater, containing nearly 90% of the liquid surface fresh water worldwide. Long retention times in lakes mean pollutants from discharges slowly circulate around the lakes and may lead to high ecological risk for ecosystem and human health. In recent decades, antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been regarded as emerging pollutants. The occurrence and distribution of antibiotics and ARGs in global freshwater lakes are summarized to show the pollution level of antibiotics and ARGs and to identify some of the potential risks to ecosystem and human health. Fifty-seven antibiotics were reported at least once in the studied lakes. Our meta-analysis shows that sulfamethoxazole, sulfamerazine, sulfameter, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, erythromycin, and roxithromycin were found at high concentrations in both lake water and lake sediment. There is no significant difference in the concentration of sulfonamides in lake water from China and that from other countries worldwide; however, there was a significant difference in quinolones. Erythromycin had the lowest predicted hazardous concentration for 5% of the species (HC5) and the highest ecological risk in lakes. There was no significant difference in the concentration of sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1 and sul2) in lake water and river water. There is surprisingly limited research on the role of aquatic biota in propagation of ARGs in freshwater lakes. As an environment that is susceptible to cumulative build-up of pollutants, lakes provide an important environment to study the fate of antibiotics and transport of ARGs with a broad range of niches including bacterial community, aquatic plants and animals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Multiple operative treatments are available for the fixation of intertrochanteric femoral fractures. This analysis was conducted to provide guidance on the appropriate clinical choice to accommodate individual patients. Methods: A systematic review was performed to identify relevant articles in databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with intertrochanteric femoral fractures were eligible if they compared 2 or more of the following interventions: proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA), percutaneous compression plate (PCCP) use, dynamic hip screw (DHS) fixation, gamma nail (GN) fixation, and artificial femoral head replacement (FHR). Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to simultaneously compare all treatment methods. Results: In total, 24 active-comparator studies involving 3097 participants were identified. Across all populations, greater reductions in blood loss and operation time were observed for PFNA than for other treatments. In terms of bleeding, more blood loss was observed for DHS use than for the PFNA (SMD, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.01-1.96), PCCP (SMD, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.31-2.20), and GN (SMD, 0.26; 95% CI, - 0.35-0.87) techniques. However, a more beneficial effect was observed for DHS use than for FHR (SMD, - 0.23; 95% CI, - 1.26-0.81). DHS use resulted in a significantly longer duration of operation time than the PFNA (SMD, 0.75; 95% CI, - 0.02-0.75), PCCP (SMD, 0.61; 95% CI, - 0.20-1.44), and GN (SMD, 0.25; 95% CI, - 0.26-0.77) techniques. Similarly, greater reductions in operation time were observed for DHS use than for FHR (SMD, - 0.12; 95% CI, - 1.15-0.91). Conclusions: The findings provide supporting evidence demonstrating the superiority of PFNA over other treatments for intertrochanteric femoral fracture. PFNA treatment results in the lowest amount of blood loss and the shortest operation time. These findings add to the existing knowledge of intertrochanteric femoral fracture treatment options. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition with progressive social and cognitive function disturbances. Most patients’ treatments are based on polypharmacy, but with no biological basis and little is known of the drugs’ interactions. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of lithium, valproate, quetiapine, and lamotrigine, and the interactions between them, on markers of inflammation, bioenergetics, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress in neuron-like cells and microglial cells. Methods: Neuron-like cells and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated C8-B4 cells were treated with lithium (2.5 mM), valproate (0.5 mM), quetiapine (0.05 mM), and lamotrigine (0.05 mM) individually and in all possible combinations for 24 h. Twenty cytokines were measured in the media from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated C8-B4 cells. Metabolic flux analysis was used to measure bioenergetics, and real-time PCR was used to measure the expression of mitochondrial function genes in neuron-like cells. The production of superoxide in treated cells was also assessed. Results: The results suggest major inhibitory effects on proinflammatory cytokine release as a therapeutic mechanism of these medications when used in combination. The various combinations of medications also caused overexpression of PGC1α and ATP5A1 in neuron-like cells. Quetiapine appears to have a proinflammatory effect in microglial cells, but this was reversed by the addition of lamotrigine independent of the drug combination. Conclusion: Polypharmacy in bipolar disorder may have antiinflammatory effects on microglial cells as well as effects on mitochondrial biogenesis in neuronal cells. © The Author(s) 2018.

We conducted a rapid systematic review on breastfeeding practices and serum concentrations of PFASs—specifically PFOS and PFOA—among reproductive-aged women and young children using the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology. Recent findings: We included 14 studies examining associations between breastfeeding and PFASs in infants/toddlers or pregnant/postnatal women. Breastfeeding was significantly associated with lower PFASs exposure among women and higher PFASs exposure among children. Summary: We concluded there was “sufficient” evidence supporting an association between breastfeeding and serum PFASs concentrations among women, and “limited” evidence of an association among children due to issues with sample size, confounding, and exposure assessment. These findings reinforce that lactation is an important excretion route of PFASs for women, and that breast milk may be an important exposure pathway for young children. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

Often ePOPs data related to occurrence, toxicity, impact or environmental behavior are insufficient or inadequate because of the lack of proper analytical methods to obtain them. Thus, a critical review of the analytical procedures proposed in the last six years (2011–2017) for determining ePOPs by chromatographic methods in the different compartments of the aquatic ecosystems is presented.

abstract={Brivaracetam (BRV) is a new high affinity synaptic vesicle protein 2A ligand recently approved for adults with partial-onset seizures. As a support to in vitro metabolism assays, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method coupled to off-line solid phase extraction (SPE) was developed to quantify BRV acid metabolites, that is, BRV-AC (carboxylic derivative derived from BRV hydrolysis) and BRV-OHAC (corresponding to hydroxylated BRV-AC). The method was validated for various incubates (liver and kidney tissue homogenates and blood, all from humans) and applied to in vitro metabolism assays. The analytes were isolated from buffered samples using ISOLUTE C8 96-well SPE plates. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Waters Atlantis T3 C18 analytical column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 5 μm) with detection accomplished using a Waters Premier tandem mass spectrometer in positive ion electrospray and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The standard curves, which ranged from 1.00 to 200 ng/mL for BRV-AC, BRV-OHAC, were fitted to a 1/x2 weighted linear regression model. The intra-assay precision and inter-assay precision (expressed as coefficient of variation -%CV) were &lt;8.5%, and the assay accuracy (deviation - %Dev) was within ±7.1% for the different matrices. This accurate, precise, and selective SPE/LC–MS/MS method has been successfully applied to in vitro assays aimed at characterizing the kinetics of BRV hydrolysis. BRV was found to be a better substrate for hydrolysis than its hydroxylated metabolite BRV-OH. BRV hydrolysis was detected in blood, liver and kidneys, demonstrating the broad distribution of the enzyme catalyzing the reaction. © 2018},

abstract={Background: Fast track surgery has been implemented in colorectal procedures during the last decade and is accompanied by significant improvement in patient outcomes during the early postoperative period. However, to date, its adoption in upper gastrointestinal surgery remains a matter of debate. In this context, we aimed to summarize the existing evidence in the international literature. Materials and methods: We searched Medline, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Central Register databases for published randomized controlled trials. The meta-analysis was performed with the RevMan 5.3.5 software. Main findings: Thirty studies were finally included in the present meta-analysis. The post-operative morbidity was not influenced by the implementation of fast track surgery (FTS) (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64–1.09). However, in cases treated with laparoscopic surgery fast track surgery seemed to reduce morbidity by 50% (p =.006). The overall mortality of patients was low in the majority of included studies and was not influenced by fast track surgery (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.50–2.52). The duration of postoperative hospitalization was significantly reduced with the adoption of FTS (MD −2.24, 95% CI −2.63 to −1.85 days). Concurrently, the overall cost was significantly reduced in cases treated with FTS (MD −982.30, 95% CI −1367.68 to −596.91 U.S dollars). Conclusion: According to the findings of our meta-analysis suggest that FTS seems to be safe in patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal surgery and reduce both the days of postoperative hospitalization and the overall cost. This observation should be taken into account in future recommendations to enhance the implementation of FTS protocols in current clinical practice. © 2017 Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (Scottish charity number SC005317) and Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland},

abstract={A series of differently substituted host molecules have been employed to systematically investigate the nature and strength of the stacking interactions with hexafluorobenzene in the solid state. The hexafluorobenzene guest binds to the crystal lattice of the parent compound, the N-ethynylphenyl benzamide host and its nine other halogenated (-F/-CF3/-Cl/-Br at ortho/meta/para positions individually) analogues via stacking of aromatic rings. The geometrical and energetic features of intermolecular interactions in host-guest molecules have been investigated, and the results elucidate the dominancy of dispersion in the stabilization of the aryl-hexafluorobenzene stacking, while the electrostatic component also plays an important role. The plots of the molecular electrostatic potential provide a fundamental basis of the electrostatic complementarity that exists in between the host and the guest. The topological characterization reveals unambiguous evidence for the direct participation of the substituents in closed-shell bonding interactions with the aromatic rings at the local geometry, which remarkably controls the nature and energetics of such motifs. Additionally, the observed upfield 19F NMR chemical shifts for perfluorinated guest upon complexation with the host compounds provide evidence for the existence of the host-guest stacking interaction also in the solution state. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Objective Many people are exposed to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) because these substances are widely used as industrial products. Although epidemiological studies suggest that PFASs can disrupt thyroid hormones, the association between PFAS exposure and thyroid function remains inconclusive. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and thyroid hormones. Methods We searched medical literature databases for articles on the association between PFASs–perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS)–and thyroid hormone levels in adults. Twelve articles were included in the meta-analysis, and the pooled z values were calculated with correlation or regression coefficients. Results The blood PFOS concentration was positively correlated with free T4. The pooled z value was 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03, 0.08). PFOS was negatively correlated with total T4 and total T3 when excluding outlier studies. In a subgroup analysis stratified by mean PFOS concentration, PFOS was observed to be positively associated with free T4 and TSH and negatively associated with total T3 in the intermediate concentration group (8–16 ng/mL). PFOA concentration was negatively correlated with total T4 (z value, -0.06; 95% CI: -0.09, -0.03) after omitting one outlier study. PFHxS also showed a negative correlation with total T4 (z value, -0.04; 95% CI: -0.07, -0.01). A subgroup analysis of pregnant women showed that there was no association between PFASs and thyroid hormones. Conclusions Our meta-analysis suggests that PFASs are negatively associated with total T4, and their effect can be different depending on the PFAS concentration. © 2018 Kim et al.

abstract={For some environments such as planktonic/aqueous environments, the separation of bacteria cells from eukaryotic cells prior to DNA extraction using filtration is relatively straightforward. However, for woodchips, the bacteria are attached/embedded within the wood matrix, which prevents easy removal of bacterial cells. In this study, a method for the selective extraction of DNA from bacteria inhabiting Eucalyptus spp. woodchips has been developed. The objective was to compare milled and unmilled woodchips processed via three detachment methods, viz., sonication, vortexing and shaking followed by filtration using Teflon filters according to three relevant criteria: DNA yield, DNA purity and quality of DNA. Highest DNA yield was obtained by milling and vortexing for 10 min (77.50 ± 5.17 ng/μl), followed by milling and vortexing for 2 min (61.00 ± 6.56 ng/μl), unmilled and vortexing for 10 min (38.67 ± 5.17 ng/μl) and milled and shaking for 2 h (31.62 ± 5.17 ng/μl). The lowest DNA yield was obtained by using unmilled woodchips and 5 min of sonication treatment (7.00 ± 1.22 ng/μl). There was no significant difference in DNA purity for milled or unmilled woodchips processed via the three detachment methods. Duration of cell detachment treatment did not significantly influence DNA yield and purity. Following optimisation experiments, it was possible to extract bacterial DNA using milled woodchips and 10 minute vortexing devoid of DNA from the host background and other associated eukaryotes and of sufficient quality and quantity for metagenomic analysis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of fluorinated substances that are in the focus of researchers and regulators due to widespread presence in the environment and biota, including humans, of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Fluoropolymers, high molecular weight polymers, have unique properties that constitute a distinct class within the PFAS group. Fluoropolymers have thermal, chemical, photochemical, hydrolytic, oxidative, and biological stability. They have negligible residual monomer and oligomer content and low to no leachables. Fluoropolymers are practically insoluble in water and not subject to long-range transport. With a molecular weight well over 100 000 Da, fluoropolymers cannot cross the cell membrane. Fluoropolymers are not bioavailable or bioaccumulative, as evidenced by toxicology studies on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE): acute and subchronic systemic toxicity, irritation, sensitization, local toxicity on implantation, cytotoxicity, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity, hemolysis, complement activation, and thrombogenicity. Clinical studies of patients receiving permanently implanted PTFE cardiovascular medical devices demonstrate no chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity and no reproductive, developmental, or endocrine toxicity. This paper brings together fluoropolymer toxicity data, human clinical data, and physical, chemical, thermal, and biological data for review and assessment to show that fluoropolymers satisfy widely accepted assessment criteria to be considered as “polymers of low concern” (PLC). This review concludes that fluoropolymers are distinctly different from other polymeric and nonpolymeric PFAS and should be separated from them for hazard assessment or regulatory purposes. Grouping fluoropolymers with all classes of PFAS for “read across” or structure–activity relationship assessment is not scientifically appropriate.

abstract={Citrus juices, especially orange juice, constitute rich sources of bioactive compounds with a wide range of health-promoting activities. Data from epidemiological and in vitro studies suggest that orange juice (OJ) may have a positive impact on lipid metabolism. However, the effect of orange juice intake on blood lipid profile is still poorly understood. We have used two different blood samples, Dried Blood Spots (DBS) and plasma, to assess the effect of two-week orange juice consumption in healthy volunteers by a mass-spectrometry based metabolomics approach. DBS were analysed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and plasma samples were analysed by the gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS). One hundred sixty-nine lipids including acylcarnitines (AC), lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPC), (diacyl- and acyl-alkyl-) phosphatidylcholines (PC aa and PC ae) and sphingomyelins (SM) were identified and quantified in DBS. Eighteen fatty acids were identified and quantified in plasma. Multivariate analysis allowed to identify an increase in C3:1, C5-DC(C6-OH), C5-M-DC, C5:1-DC, C8, C12-DC, lysoPC18:3, myristic acid, pentadecanoic acid, palmitoleic and palmitic acid and a decrease in nervonic acid, C0, C2, C10, C10:1, C16:1, C16-OH, C16:1-OH, C18-OH, PC aa C40:4, PC ae C38:4, PC ae C42:3, PC ae C42:4 and cholesterol levels after orange juice intake. A two-week period of orange juice intake could affect fatty acids β-oxidation through mitochondrial and peroxisomal pathways, leading to an increase of short-chain acylcarnitines and a decrease of medium and long-chain acylcarnitines. This is the first report analyzing the effect of orange juice intake in healthy volunteers using a dried blood spot-based metabolomics approach. © 2018},

abstract={Background. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous condition with multiple clinical faces. Metabolomic profling studies small molecules present in biological samples by combined use of chromatography with mass spectrometry. Objectives. The goal of our work was to perform a high performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) metabolomic study to compare the concentrations of metabolites in COPD patients and in controls. Material and methods. Participants were recruited at the University Hospital, Hradec Králové, Czech Republic, with the approval of the ethics committee. The analysis of blood samples was performed at Health Sciences Center (HSC) in Kuwait. The blood samples were analyzed for concentrations of acylcarnitines and amino acids by high performance liquid chromatography (Waters 2690 HPLC; Waters, Milford, USA) and a triple-quadruple tandem mass spectrometer (Quattro LC, Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom). Results. Groups of 10 subjects with COPD and 10 healthy controls were analyzed. Carnitine analysis showed that the free carnitine to acylcarnitine ratio (C0/AC ratio) was signifcantly lower in COPD (0.58 μM/L) compared to the controls (0.73 μM/L; p = 0.002). The mean C8/C2 ratio in the COPD group was signifcantly higher (0.03 μM/L)-in the control group it was 0 μM/L (p = 0.03). Amino acid analysis showed lower levels of phenylalanine in the COPD group (22.05 μM/L) compared to the controls (30.05 μM/L; p = 0.008). The alanine concentrations were signifcantly lower in the COPD group (173 μM/L) than in the control group (253 μM/L; p = 0.001). The pyroglutamate levels were higher in COPD (1.58 μM/L) than in the controls (1 μM/L; p = 0.040). Conclusions. The carnitine and acylcarnitine levels in COPD subjects in this study possibly indicate a predisposition to atherosclerosis as a result of inadequate β-oxidation of fatty acids and show the presence of oxidative stress. Furthermore, the high sensitivity to changes in circulating amino acid levels may allow us to detect subclinical malnutrition and take early preventative interventions such as nutritional supplementation and patient education. © 2018 by Wroclaw Medical University.},

The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence in associated with drinking water DBP exposure in relation to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Peer-reviewed articles were identified using electronic databases searched for studies published in the English language. Studies selected for review were evaluated for exposure assessment, confounders, and analyses risks of bias in the selection, outcomes assessment, and attrition. A comprehensive search and screening yielded a total of 32 studies, of which 12 (38%) reported a statistical association between maternal exposure to DBPs and adverse pregnancy outcomes. A maternal exposure to trihalomethanes (THMs) shows an increased risk of small for gestational age (SGA) and slightly increased risk of pregnancy loss. Risks of bias were low among the studies included in the review. Evidence on association relating to adverse pregnancy outcomes to DBP exposure is still less significant. There is a need for future robust research in this field, with the use of urinary trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) biomarkers as a direct exposure assessment method for this field. © IWA Publishing 2018.},

abstract={Ice adhesion is an issue spanning a wide range of technical fields. In the aerospace industry, ice accretion has led to a large number of casualties and costs the industry billions of dollars every year. To design effective anti-/de-icing systems, the adhesion of ice to surfaces must be understood. In this review paper, the authors surveyed for papers providing methods for the measurement of ice adhesion. 113 papers were identified for comparison, with data being extracted from 58 papers with common test surfaces (aluminum, steel, Teflon® (Chemours), and polyurethane). The methods used were categorized and data were compared based on their precision and the trends they demonstrated. Conceptual problems were identified with the tests used in the literature and discussed, and open questions relevant to testing the adhesion of ice were identified. Several key parameters affecting ice adhesion identified from the literature were temperature, surface roughness, strain rate, and impact velocity. Their effects on adhesion strength were discussed. While researching this topic, it was discovered that many papers did not report the strain rate in their tests, and the vast majority of papers did not correct their data for stress concentrations on the surface, either of which has been shown to cause variation in the data by one order of magnitude. Data compared from the literature typically spanned one to three orders of magnitude. The causes of these variations were discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Studies have shown that perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are routinely detected in landfill leachate, with short chain (C4-C7) PFAAs being most abundant, possibly indicating their greater mobility, and reflecting the industrial shift towards shorter-chain compounds. Despite its restricted use, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) remains one of the most abundant PFAAs in landfill leachates. Recent studies have also documented the presence of PFAA-precursors (e.g., saturated and unsaturated fluorotelomer carboxylic acids) in landfill leachates at concentrations comparable to, or higher than, the most frequently detected PFAAs. Landfill ambient air also contains elevated concentrations of PFASs, primarily semi-volatile precursors (e.g., fluorotelomer alcohols) compared to upwind control sites, suggesting that landfills are potential sources of atmospheric PFASs. The fate of PFASs inside landfills is controlled by a combination of biological and abiotic processes, with biodegradation releasing most of the PFASs from landfilled waste to leachate. Biodegradation in simulated anaerobic reactors has been found to be closely related to the methanogenic phase. The methane-yielding stage also results in higher pH (>7) of leachates, correlated with higher mobility of PFAAs. Little information exists regarding PFAA-precursors in landfills. To avoid significant underestimation of the total PFAS released from landfills, PFAA-precursors and their degradation products should be determined in future studies. Owing to the semi-volatile nature of some precursor compounds and their degradation products, future studies also need to include landfill gas to clarify degradation pathways and the overall fate of PFASs. Landfill leachate and potentially landfill gas act as secondary environmental sources of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Introduction and hypothesis: Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) negatively affect quality of life in the general population, and their prevalence in gynecologic cancer survivors has not been systematically described. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of PFDs in cancer survivors. We hypothesized that the prevalence of PFDs in the gynecologic cancer population would be higher than in the general female population. Methods: We searched PubMed (1809 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) through May 2017. The search combined subject headings, title, and abstract words for gynecologic cancer, PFDs, and prevalence. Any studies evaluating the prevalence of PFDs in gynecologic malignancies were included. Results: A total of 550 articles met the designated search criteria and 31 articles were included in this review. In cervical cancer survivors, before treatment the prevalences of stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) and fecal incontinence (FI) were 24–29%, 8–18% and 6%, respectively, and after treatment the prevalences of SUI, UUI, urinary retention, FI, fecal urge, dyspareunia and vaginal dryness were 4–76%, 4–59%, 0.4–39%, 2–34%, 3–49%, 12–58% and 15–47%, respectively. In uterine cancer survivors, before treatment the prevalences of SUI, UUI and FI were 29–36%, 15–25% and 3%, respectively, and after treatment the prevalences of urinary incontinence (UI) and dyspareunia were 2–44% and 7–39%, respectively. In vulvar cancer survivors, after treatment the prevalences of UI, SUI and FI were 4–32%, 6–20% and 1–20%, respectively. In ovarian cancer survivors, the prevalences of SUI, UUI, prolapse and sexual dysfunction were 32–42%, 15–39%, 17% and 62–75%, respectively. Conclusions: PFDs are prevalent in gynecologic cancer survivors and this is an important area of clinical concern and future research. © 2017, The International Urogynecological Association.},

Results: Perfluorocarbon liquids and partially fluorinated alkanes are associated with tamponade emulsification, intraocular inflammation, and rises in intraocular pressure, but these associations are not as strong when these substances are mixed with a heavy silicone oil (HSO). Two recently approved heavy silicone oil tamponades, Oxane HD and Densiron 68, are now available for use in clinical practice. While the complication spectrum of the new generation of these HSOs seems to be similar to that of conventional silicone oil tamponades, they provide better support for the inferior retina and the posterior pole. Conclusion: Both regular and heavy silicone oils usually yield good success rates in cases of complicated retinal detachment. Decisions as to whether to utilize heavy or regular silicone oil should be made on a case-by-case basis. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Biomarkers of environmental metal exposure in children are important for elucidating exposure and health risk. While exposure biomarkers for As, Cd, and Pb are relatively well defined, there are not yet well-validated biomarkers of Mn exposure. Here, we measured hair Mn, Pb, Cd, and As levels in children from the Mid-Ohio Valley to determine within and between-subject predictors of hair metal levels. Occipital scalp hair was collected in 2009-2010 from 222 children aged 6-12 years (169 female, 53 male) participating in a study of chemical exposure and neurodevelopment in an industrial region of the Mid-Ohio Valley. Hair samples from females were divided into three two centimeter segments, while males provided a single segment. Hair was cleaned and processed in a trace metal clean laboratory, and analyzed for As, Cd, Mn, and Pb by magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Hair Mn and Pb levels were comparable (median 0.11 and 0.15 μg/g, respectively) and were ~10-fold higher than hair Cd and As levels (0.007 and 0.018 μg/g, respectively). Hair metal levels were higher in males compared to females, and varied by ~100-1000-fold between all subjects, and substantially less ( < 40-70%) between segments within female subjects. Hair Mn, Pb, and Cd, but not As levels systematically increased by ~40-70% from the proximal to distal hair segments of females. There was a significant effect of season of hair sample collection on hair Mn, Pb, and Cd, but not As levels. Finally, hair metal levels reported here are ~2 to > 10-fold lower than levels reported in other studies in children, most likely because of more rigorous hair cleaning methodology used in the present study, leading to lower levels of unresolved exogenous metal contamination of hair. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Nearly one-half of patients with cryptogenic stroke have a patent foramen ovale (PFO). The dilemma of whether to close these PFOs percutaneously, in an effort to reduce the risk of recurrent paradoxical embolism, has been a matter of ongoing debate for more than a decade. Early randomized clinical trials failed to demonstrate a significant benefit of percutaneous PFO closure for secondary prevention of cryptogenic stroke in an intention-to-treat analysis. The long-term follow-up data from the RESPECT trial and 2 new randomized trials (CLOSE and REDUCE) have clarified these findings. They showed that with good patient selection, transcatheter PFO closure significantly reduces the risk of recurrent stroke compared with medical therapy in patients with cryptogenic stroke, with no increased risk of serious adverse events or influence on major bleeding. © 2018 American College of Cardiology Foundation},

abstract={Background: The optimal strategy for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO) is unknown. Purpose: To compare transcatheter PFO closure with medical therapy alone for prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke. Data Sources: PubMed and the Cochrane Library (without language restrictions) from inception to October 2017, reference lists, and abstracts from cardiology meetings. Study Selection: Randomized trials enrolling adults with PFO and cryptogenic stroke that compared stroke outcomes (main outcome) and potential harms in those receiving transcatheter device closure versus medical therapy alone. Data Extraction: Two investigators independently extracted study data and rated risk of bias. Data Synthesis: Of 5 trials, 1 was excluded because it used a device that is no longer available due to high rates of complications and failure. Four high-quality trials enrolling 2892 patients showed that PFO closure decreased the absolute risk for recurrent stroke by 3.2% (risk difference, -0.032 [95% CI, -0.050 to -0.014]) compared with medical therapy. The treatment strategies did not differ in rates of transient ischemic attack or major bleeding. Closure of PFOs was associated with higher rates of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) than medical therapy alone in all trials, but this outcome had marked between-trial heterogeneity (I2 = 82.5%), and high event rates in some groups resulted in extreme values for CIs. Limitation: Heterogeneity of device type and antithrombotic therapy across trials, small numbers for some outcomes, and heterogeneous and inconclusive AF results. Conclusion: In patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke, transcatheter device closure decreases risk for recurrent stroke compared with medical therapy alone. Because recurrent stroke rates are low even with medical therapy alone and PFO closure might affect AF risk, shared decision making is crucial for this treatment. © 2018 American College of Physicians.},

abstract={Background: Intertrochanteric hip fractures are common and devastating injuries especially for the elderly. Surgical treatment is the optimal strategy for managing intertrochanteric fractures as it allows early rehabilitation and functional recovery. The relative effects of internal fixation strategies for intertrochanteric fracture after operation remain limited to relatively small studies which create uncertainty in attempts to establish evidence-based best practice. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies to assess the clinical effectiveness of two commonly used intramedullary devices: a twin screw integrated cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) versus a single screw cephalomedullary nail (proximal femoral nail antirotation) in patients with intertrochanteric fractures. The following outcomes were considered: revisions, implant-related failures, non-unions, pain, Harris Hip Score and intraoperative outcomes. Odds ratios or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals in brackets are reported. Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria, two randomised controlled trials and four observational studies enrolling 970 patients with mean age of 77years, and 64% of patients were female. There was a statistically significant difference (p value <0.05) for revisions OR 0.27 (0.13 to 0.56), implant-related failures OR 0.16 (0.09 to 0.27) and proportion of patients complaining of pain OR 0.50 (0.34 to 0.74). There was no difference in non-unions and Harris Hip Score (p value >0.05). There was a significant difference in blood loss and fluoroscopy usage in favour of PFNA, whilst no difference in operating times were observed between the two devices. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that a twin screw integrated cephalomedullary nail InterTAN is clinically more effective when compared to a single screw cephalomedullary nail proximal femoral nail antirotation resulting in fewer complications, fewer revisions and fewer patients complaining of pain. No difference has been established regarding non-unions and Harris Hip Score. Intraoperative outcomes favour PFNA with less blood loss and fluoroscopy usage. Further studies are warranted to explore the cost-effectiveness of these and other implants in managing patients with intertrochanteric fractures. © 2018 The Author(s).},

This study seeks to describe studies among women with PFD and the associated frailty assessments as recommended in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program/American Geriatric Society (ACS NSQIP/AGS) guidelines. Methods This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) criteria are applied to assess study quality. Data synthesis is descriptive. Outcomes of interest include the ratio of studies adhering to the ACS NSQIP/AGS guidelines and evidence for frailty assessments versus usual care for women with PFDs. Results Twenty studies regarding frailty and PFDs were included for systematic review. Studies were categorized as relating to (1) epidemiology, (2) frailty and incontinence, (3) postoperative morbidity, and (4) surgical choice. Most studies (5/20) did not define frailty or failed to follow the ACS NSQIP/AGS guidelines. All studies were of very low to low quality. Collectively, each category generated very low GRADE quality evidence of frailty and the relationship to PFDs. Conclusions Most studies regarding frailty among women with PFDs did not define frailty as recommended in the ACS NSQIP/AGS guidelines. The evidence regarding PFDs and frailty is of very low quality. This is the first systematic review regarding frailty assessments specifically among women with PFDs. Paucity of data regarding frailty in women with PFDs, particularly with regard to surgical choice and surgical counseling, highlights the need for further study in this area. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

abstract={Background and objective: In utero exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been associated with decreases in birth weight. We aimed to estimate the proportion of PFOA-attributable low birth weight (LBW) births and associated costs in the US from 2003 to 2014, a period during which there were industry-initiated and regulatory activities aimed at reducing exposure. Methods: Serum PFOA levels among women 18–49 years were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2003–2014; birth weight distributions were obtained from the Vital Statistics Natality Birth Data. The exposure-response relationship identified in a previous meta-analysis (18.9 g decrease in birth weight per 1 ng/mL of PFOA) was applied to quantify PFOA-attributable LBW (reference level of 3.1 ng/mL for our base case, 1 and 3.9 ng/mL for sensitivity analyses). Hospitalization costs and lost economic productivity were also estimated. Results: Serum PFOA levels remained approximately constant from 2003–2004 (median: 3.3 ng/mL) to 2007–2008 (3.5 ng/mL), and declined from 2009–2010 (2.8 ng/mL) to 2013–2014 (1.6 ng/mL). In 2003–2004, an estimated 12,764 LBW cases (4% of total for those years) were potentially preventable if PFOA exposure were reduced to the base case reference level (10,203 cases in 2009–2010 and 1,491 in 2013–2014). The total cost of PFOA-attributable LBW for 2003 through 2014 was estimated at $13.7 billion, with $2.97 billion in 2003–2004, $2.4 billion in 2009–2010 and $347 million in 2013–2014. Conclusions: Serum PFOA levels began to decline in women of childbearing age in 2009–2010. Declines were of a magnitude expected to meaningfully reduce the estimated incidence of PFOA-attributable LBW and associated costs. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs)-mediated quorum sensing in bacterial communities have been extensively observed. However, the metabolic pathways regulated by AHLs in bacteria remain elusive. Here, we combined long-term reactor operation with microbiological and metabolomics analyses to explore the regulatory pathways for different AHLs in anammox consortia, which perform promising nitrogen removal for wastewater treatment. The results showed that no obvious shifts induced by exogenous AHLs occurred in the microbial community and, mainly, dosing AHLs induced changes in the metabolites. 3OC6-HSL, C6-HSL, and C8-HSL controlled the electron transport carriers that influence the bacterial activity. In contrast, only 3OC6-HSL regulated LysoPC(20:0) metabolism, which affected bacterial growth. AHLs mainly regulated the synthesis of the amino acids Ala, Val, and Glu and selectively regulated Asp and Leu to affect extracellular proteins. Simultaneously, all the AHLs regulated the ManNAc biosynthetic pathways, while OC6-HSL, OC8-HSL, and C6-HSL particularly enriched the UDP-GlcNAc pathway to promote exopolysaccharides, resulting in different aggregation levels of the anammox consortia. Our results not only provide the first metabolic insights into the means by which AHLs affect anammox consortia but also hint at potential strategies for overcoming the limitations of the long start-up period required for wastewater treatment by anammox processing. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Digestion techniques for ICP analysis have been poorly studied for biological samples. This report describes an optimized method for analysis of trace metals that can be used across a variety of sample types. Digestion methods were tested and optimized with the analysis of trace metals in cancerous as compared to normal tissue as the end goal. Anthropological, forensic, oncological and environmental research groups can employ this method reasonably cheaply and safely whilst still being able to compare between laboratories. We examined combined HNO3 and H2O2 digestion at 170 °C for human, porcine and bovine samples whether they are frozen, fresh or lyophilized powder. Little discrepancy is found between microwave digestion and PFA Teflon pressure vessels. The elements of interest (Cu, Zn, Fe and Ni) yielded consistently higher and more accurate values on standard reference material than samples heated to 75 °C or samples that utilized HNO3 alone. Use of H2SO4 does not improve homogeneity of the sample and lowers precision during ICP analysis. High temperature digestions (&gt;165 °C) using a combination of HNO3 and H2O2 as outlined are proposed as a standard technique for all mammalian tissues, specifically, human tissues and yield greater than 300% higher values than samples digested at 75 °C regardless of the acid or acid combinations used. The proposed standardized technique is designed to accurately quantify potential discrepancies in metal loads between cancerous and healthy tissues and applies to numerous tissue studies requiring quick, effective and safe digestions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library Databases and supplemented by other searches to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the comparison of fast track surgery combined with laparoscopy versus laparoscopy separately used in radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer before December 2016. After screening for inclusion, data extraction, and quality assessment, meta-analysis was conducted by the Review Manager 5.3 software.        Results: A total of 6 RCTs, involving 464 patients, were included. There were 232 patients in the FTS group and conventional care group separately. Compared with the conventional care group, patients of FTS group had shorter postoperative hospital stay [WMD = -1.85, 95% CI: (-2.60, -1.11), P < .00001], earlier first flatus [WMD = -9.33, 95% CI: (-13.74, -4.91), P < .0001], lower level of C-reactive protein (CRP) at postoperative day 4 [WMD = -13.94, 95% CI: (-22.74, -5.15), P = .002], and less hospitalization fees [SMD = -1.12, 95% CI: (-2.07, -0.18), P = .02]. There were no significant differences in operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative complications between the two groups.        Conclusion: Based on current evidence, the FTS protocol is safe and effective in laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer.

Previously, we showed that propranolol, an active pharmaceutical ingredient, had adverse effects on Daphnia magna that were similar to its pharmaceutical action. In order to characterize the mode of action of propranolol in D. magna, which is suspected to be organ-specific pharmaceutical action or baseline toxicity, we performed time-series monitoring of behavior along with heart rate measurements and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabolite profiling. Principle component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering were used to categorize the mode of action of propranolol among 5 chemicals with different modes of action. The findings showed that the mode of action of propranolol in D. magna is organ-specific and vastly different from those of narcotics, even though metabolite regulation is similar between narcotic and non-narcotic candidates. The method applied in this study seems applicable to rapid characterization of the MOA of other cardiovascular pharmaceutical ingredients. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

There are two principal strategies that can be employed to decrease the rates and impact of chemical degradation. The first involves decreasing the concentration of reactive oxidant species formed in the fuel cell. The second strategy for chemical degradation mitigation involves deactivation of the oxidants before membrane damage occurs. In 2005, it was reported that Ce3+ and Mn2+ are very effective at protecting PFSA membranes from chemical degradation. The use of Mn2+ will be discussed by analogy. The metal cations can be introduced to the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) by a number of methods, including direct membrane doping or transfer from the electrode ink or ionomer overcoat. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

abstract={Background: There is a concern that continued emissions of man-made per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may cause environmental and human health effects. Now widespread in human populations and in the environment, several PFASs are also present in remote regions of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of PFASs are not well understood. Phasing out the manufacture of some types of PFASs started in 2000 and further regulatory and voluntary actions have followed. The objective of this review is to understand the effects of these actions on global scale PFAS concentrations. Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations were performed in bibliographic databases, on the internet, through stakeholder contacts and in review bibliographies. No time, document type, language or geographical constraints were applied in the searches. Relevant subjects included human and environmental samples. Two authors screened all retrieved articles. Dual screening of 10% of the articles was performed at title/abstract and full-text levels by all authors. Kappa tests were used to test consistency. Relevant articles were critically appraised by four reviewers, with double checking of 20% of the articles by a second reviewer. Meta-analysis of included temporal trends was considered but judged to not be appropriate. The trends were therefore discussed in a narrative synthesis. Results: Available evidence suggests that human concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) generally are declining, while previously increasing concentrations of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) have begun to level off. Rapid declines for PFOS-precursors (e.g. perfluorooctane sulfonamide, FOSA) have also been consistently observed in human studies. In contrast, limited data indicate that human concentrations of PFOS and PFOA are increasing in China where the production of these substances has increased. Human concentrations of longer-chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) with 9-14 carbon atoms are generally increasing or show insignificant trends with too low power to detect a trend. For abiotic and biological environmental samples there are no clear patterns of declining trends. Most substances show mixed results, and a majority of the trends are insignificant with low power to detect a trend. Conclusions: For electrochemically derived PFASs, including PFOS and PFOA, most human studies in North America and Europe show consistent statistically significant declines. This contrasts with findings in wildlife and in abiotic environmental samples, suggesting that declining PFOS, PFOS-precursor and PFOA concentrations in humans likely resulted from removal of certain PFASs from commercial products including paper and board used in food packaging. Increasing concentrations of long-chain PFCAs in most matrices, and in most regions, is likely due to increased use of alternative PFASs. Continued temporal trend monitoring in the environment with well-designed studies with high statistical power are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of past and continuing regulatory mitigation measures. For humans, more temporal trend studies are needed in regions where manufacturing is most intense, as the one human study available in China is much different than in North America or Europe. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={The extensive range of chemical structures, wide range of abundances, and chemical instability of metabolites present in the metabolome pose major analytical challenges that are difficult to address with existing technologies. To address these issues, one approach is to target a subset of metabolites that share a functional group, such as ketones and aldehydes, using chemoselective tagging. Here we report a greatly improved chemoselective method for the quantitative analysis of hydrophilic and hydrophobic carbonyl-containing metabolites directly in biological samples. This method is based on direct tissue or cells extraction with simultaneous derivatization of stable and labile carbonylated metabolites using N-[2-(aminooxy)ethyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1-dodecylammonium (QDA) and 13CD3 labeled QDA. We combined innovations of direct quenching of biological sample with frozen derivatization conditions under the catalyst N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, which facilitated the formation of oxime stable-isotope ion pairs differing by m/z 4.02188 while minimizing metabolite degradation. The resulting oximes were extracted by HyperSep C8 tips to remove interfering compounds, and the products were detected using nano-electrospray ionization interfaced with a Thermo Fusion mass spectrometer. The quaternary ammonium tagging greatly increased electrospray MS detection sensitivity and the signature ions pairs enabled simple identification of carbonyl compounds. The improved method showed the lower limits of quantification for carbonyl standards to be in the range of 0.20-2 nM, with linearity of R2 &gt; 0.99 over 4 orders of magnitude. We have applied the method to assign 66 carbonyls in mouse tumor tissues, many of which could not be assigned solely by accurate mass and tandem MS. Fourteen of the metabolites were quantified using authentic standards. We also demonstrated the suitability of this method for determining 13C labeled isotopologues of carbonyl metabolites in 13C6-glucose-based stable isotope-resolved metabolomic (SIRM) studies. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

In this regard, this article aims to identify the weaknesses of the adopted system of transport of cryptographic information by the operator of fiscal data and to systematize the theoretical data in relation to the theory on the question of part of the FTS data. The leading approach to the study of the problem is the analysis of the existing system in conjunction with the synthesis of data through the compilation of information, which allows a comprehensive review and systematization of data on the economic phenomenon. The article substantiates the need to reduce the state regulation of restrictions on the formation of information security barriers. The materials of the article are of practical value for the organization of big data stream transportation protection. © 2018 International Strategic Management Association. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Background: Recent randomized controlled trial (RCTs) comparing percutaneous closure with antithrombotic treatment in patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) and cryptogenic stroke revealed inconsistent results. Indeed, there is still no consensus on the management of these patients, namely closure or medical therapy treatment. Methods: To take stock of the PFO management after cryptogenic stroke, we conducted a literature review that included 16 articles dealing with different therapeutic strategies and long-term outcomes of these results. Results: The reviewed studies showed great methodological diversity rendering an exhaustive and balanced comparison between studies difficult. Low recurrence rates under prevention regimens, crossovers, procedure- and device-related complications, as well as inappropriate patient selection might explain the inconsistency of trials. However, despite the methodological heterogeneity certain patterns could be detected. It appears that device closure as secondary prevention measure is an effective and safe procedure reducing the recurrence of neurological events in cryptogenic stroke patients <60 years with large PFOs. Standardization of procedures and larger trials are needed to arrive to definitive conclusions. Conclusion: In cryptogenic stroke patients <60 years with large PFOs, PFO closure seems to be safe and more effective compared to medical treatment alone. For all other patients group, for example, patients >60 years further trials are needed to clarify the role of PFO closure. © 2018 Surgical Neurology International Published by Wolters Kluwer Medknow.},

abstract={Background: Pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFDs) affect the female population, and the postpartum period can be related to the onset or aggravation of the disease. Early identification of the symptoms and the impact on quality of life can be achieved through assessment instruments. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate questionnaires used to assess PFD in the postpartum period. Methods: A systematic review study was conducted, following Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria, using the databases: PubMed, Biblioteca Virtual de Saúde (BVS), Web of Science, and Scopus, and the keywords PFD or pelvic floor disorders, postpartum or puerperium, and questionnaire. Articles published up till May 2018 were included, searching for articles using validated questionnaires for the evaluation of PFDs in postpartum women. The articles included were evaluated according to a checklist, and the validation studies and translated versions of the questionnaires were identified. Results: The search of the databases resulted in 359 papers, and 33 were selected to compose this systematic review, using nine validated questionnaires to assess PFDs in the postpartum period: International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire – Vaginal Symptoms (ICIQ-VS), Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory 20 (PFDI-20), Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ-7), PFDI-46, Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ-31), Pelvic Floor Bother Questionnaire (PFBQ), Female Pelvic Floor Questionnaire, electronic Personal Assessment Questionnaire – Pelvic Floor, and PFD questionnaire specific for pregnancy and postpartum. The most frequently reported questionnaires included PFDI-20, PFIQ-7, and ICIQ-VS and are recommended by ICI. In addition, the review identified a specific questionnaire, recently developed, to access PFD during pregnancy and postpartum. Conclusion: The questionnaires used to evaluate PFD during postpartum period are developed for general population or urology/gynecology patients with incontinence and reinforce the paucity of highly recommended questionnaires designed for postpartum, in order to improve early and specific approach for this period of life. © 2018 Zuchelo et al.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: A recent meta-analysis of 15 studies found a change in birthweight of -12.8 grams (95% CI -23.1, -2.38) per ng/ml PFOA in maternal or cord blood, and -27.1 grams (-50.6, -3.6) per log ng/ml PFOA (Negri E et al. Crit Rev Toxicol 2017;47:482-508). Almost all studies were done in low-exposed populations. There are nine new studies, adding 6019 births to the previous 6937 births. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of 24 studies. To combine all results, we approximated results for untransformed PFOA from nine studies using log-transformed PFOA. We also included another large study, excluded from previous analyses, in a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: We found a change of birthweight of -10.5 grams (-16.7, -4.4) for every ng/ml PFOA in maternal or cord blood. After adding one previously excluded large study, we found little evidence of an association (-1.0 grams, 95% CI -2.4, 0.4). Restricting to studies where blood was sampled from mothers early in the pregnancy or shortly before conception (5393 births), we found little association of PFOA with birthweight (-3.3 grams (-9.6, 3.0)). In studies where blood was sampled late in the pregnancy (7563 pregnancies), lower birthweight was associated with higher PFOA (-17.8 (-25.0, -10.6)). CONCLUSION: Present human evidence provides only modest support for decreased birthweight with increasing PFOA. Studies with a wide range of exposure, and studies with blood sampled early in pregnancy, showed little or no association of PFOA with birthweight. These are studies in which confounding and reverse causality would be of less concern.},

abstract={Exposure to potential Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) pose a documented risk to both wildlife and human health. Many studies so far described declining sperm counts, genital malformations, early puberty onset, highlighting the negative impact on reproduction caused by the exposure to many anthropogenic chemicals. In the last years, increasing evidence suggested that these compounds, other than altering reproduction, affect metabolism and induce the onset of obesity and metabolic disorders. According to the “environmental obesogens” hypothesis, evidence exists that exposure to potential EDCs during critical periods when adipocytes are differentiating, and organs are developing, can induce diseases that manifest later in the life. This review summarizes the effects occurring at the hepatic level in different animal models, describing morphological alterations and changes of molecular pathways elicited by the toxicant exposure. Results currently available demonstrated that these chemicals impair normal metabolic processes via interaction with members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, including steroid hormone receptors, thyroid hormone receptors, retinoid X receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, liver X receptors, and farnesoid X receptors. In addition, novel results revealed that EDC exposure can either affect circadian rhythms as well as up-regulate the expression of signals belonging to the endocannabinoid system, in both cases leading to a remarkable increase of lipid accumulation. These results warrant further research and increase the interest toward the identification of new mechanisms for EDC metabolic alterations. The last part of this review article condenses recent evidences on the ability of potential EDCs to cause “transgenerational effects” by a single prenatal or early life exposure. On this regard, there is compelling evidence that epigenetic modifications link developmental environmental insults to adult disease susceptibility. This review will contribute to summarize the mechanisms underlying the insurgence of EDC-induced metabolic alterations as well as to build integrated strategies for their better management. In fact, despite the large number of results obtained so far, there is still a great demand for the development of frameworks that can integrate mechanistic and toxicological/epidemiological observations. This would increase legal and governmental institution awareness on this critical environmental issue responsible for negative consequences in both wild species and human health.

abstract={In recent years, the birthrate has been continuously declining in Japan. The main causes of the decline are social factors. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that many environmental chemicals show endocrine disrupting properties. Thus, we hypothesized that exposure to these chemicals would also be a causal for the fertility crisis. In this review, we examined current evidence that focused on environmental chemical exposure in utero and its association with reproductive hormones in children. We have included the findings from a prospective birth cohorts, the Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health Sapporo cohort. According to the literature, environmental chemical levels in utero, such as polychlorinated biphenyl, dioxins, perfluorinated chemical substances, phthalates, and bisphenol A were somewhat associated with the levels of reproductive hormones, such as testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, inhibin B, and insulin-like factor-3 in cord blood, in early childhood and adolescence. The literature also suggests the association between exposure to these chemicals and brain-sexual differentiation or the anogenital distance, which suggests the disruption of androgen shower during the developmental stage in the fetal period. There are still knowledge gaps on whether these hormones at an early stage affect the pubertal development and reproductive functions in later life. In addition, alternative chemicals are produced after banning one type. The health effects of alternative chemicals should be evaluated. Effects of exposure to a mixture of the chemicals should also be examined in future studies. In conclusion, the prevention of environmental chemical hazards in relation to human reproductive function is important. It would be one of the countermeasures to the falling birthrate caused by fertility issues.},

abstract={Background: Follow-up studies have reported both positive and negative associations between prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and some anthropometric indicators of overweight and obesity in children. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of this exposure on cardiometabolic risk factors in preschool-age children. The health and disease development paradigm (DOHaD) proposes that the physiological and metabolic adaptations triggered by the exposure to these compounds, coupled with postnatal conditions, can modify the risk of disease. In this context, cardiometabolic risk factors in children are not only an important outcome derived from prenatal exposure but a predictor/mediator of the children’s future health. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the evidence published in the last 10 years from cohort studies on the association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and cardiometabolic risk factors in preschoolers. Design: Studies published from January 1, 2007 to May 1, 2017 in PubMed were analyzed. The research strategy was based on specified keywords and following the application of strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, 16 studies were identified and reviewed. Data were extracted and aspects of quality were assessed using an adapted Newcastle–Ottawa scale for cohort studies. Results: Only 5 of the 16 studies reviewed analyzed cardiometabolic risk factors in addition to anthropometric measures in children. The cohort studies included in this review suggest that prenatal exposure to low concentrations of EDCs has an impact on anthropometric variables and biochemical parameters in preschool-age children. Positive associations between prenatal exposure to EDCs and percentage of fat mass, body mass index, waist circumference, skinfolds and risk of overweight persisted after adjustment for important confounding variables. No association was found with lipid profile and glucose levels. Conclusions: Evidence was found to suggest that prenatal exposure to EDCs is positively associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in preschool children. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Despite advances in ART, implantation and pregnancy rates per embryo transfer still remain low. IVF laboratories strive to ensure that the process of handling gametes in vitro closely mimics the in vivo environment. However, there remains a lack of knowledge regarding the in vivo regulation and dynamic variation in biophysical parameters such as oxygen concentration, pH and temperature within the reproductive tract. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: To undertake a systematic review of the current understanding of the physico-chemical parameters of oxygen tension (pO2), pH and temperature within the female reproductive tract, and their potential implications in clinical and pathological processes related to fertility and those pertaining to limited reproductive capacity. SEARCH METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Pubmed to identify original and review articles addressing the biophysical parameters (pO2, pH and temperature) in the female reproductive tract of any species. The search included all studies published between 1946 and November 2015. Search terms included 'oxygen', 'pH', 'hydrogen ion concentration', 'acid base' and others terms. We also used special features and truncations to identify synonyms and broaden the search. Studies were excluded if they only assessed embryo culture conditions, fetal acid-base status, oxidative stress, outcomes of pregnancy and measurements of these parameters in non-reproductive organs. OUTCOMES: Our search generated 18 685 records and 60 articles were included. pO2 within the female reproductive tract shows cyclical variation and minute-to-minute oscillations, which may be influenced by uterine contractility, hormones, the autonomic system, cardiac pulsatility, and myometrial and smooth muscle integrity. Fine balanced control of pO2 and avoidance of overwhelming oxidative stress is crucial for embryogenesis and implantation. The pH in the female reproductive tract is graduated, with lowest pH in the vagina (~pH 4.42) increasing toward the Fallopian tubes (FTs) (~pH 7.94), reflecting variation in the site-specific microbiome and acid-base buffering at the tissue/cellular level. The temperature variation in humans is cyclical by day and month. In humans, it is biphasic, increasing in the luteal phase; with the caudal region of the oviduct 1-2 degrees cooler than the cranial portion. Temperature variation is influenced by hormones, density of pelvic/uterine vascular beds and effectiveness of heat exchange locally, crucial for sperm motility and embryo development. We have identified significant deficiencies and inconsistencies in the methods used to assess these biophysical factors within the reproductive tract. We have suggested that the technological solutions including the development of methods and models for real time, in vivo recordings of biophysical parameters. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The notion of 'back to nature' in assisted conception suggested 20 years ago has yet to be translated into clinical practice. While the findings from this systematic review do not provide evidence to change current in vitro protocols, it highlights our current inability to assess the in vivo reproductive tract environment in real time. Data made available through future development of sensing technology in utero may help to provide new insights into how best to optimize the in vitro embryo environment and allow for more precise and personalized fertility treatment. © The Author 2017.},

Methods: We searched several medical literature data bases with the following key words: "oral allergy syndrome," "OAS," "pollen-food allergy syndrome," "PFAS," "allergy," "diagnosis," "treatment." Results: Oral allergy syndrome (OAS), also called "pollen-food allergy syndrome," is a type of food allergy brought about by flavors, nuts, raw fruit, and vegetables. The most well-known symptoms are mouth and throat itching, which starts rapidly after a food is placed in the mouth, and that, as a rule, continues for just a couple of minutes after the food has been swallowed. The frequency of OAS with pollen allergy has been reported as 5-8%; 1-2% of patients with OAS with pollen allergy show extreme responses, e.g., anaphylaxis. Birch tree pollen, ragweed pollen, and grass pollen hypersensitivity cause the symptoms. The diagnosis of OAS is confirmed by a positive history and positive skin-prick test result triggered by the food's fresh extract. Oral challenge result is normally positive with the raw food and negative with the similar cooked food. Conclusion: Patients with grass allergy may have a response to peaches, oranges, celery, tomatoes, and melons. Patients with ragweed allergy may show OAS symptoms with melon, cucumber, banana, and zucchini. Physicians should be aware of OAS and know the appropriate treatment. © Copyright 2018, OceanSide Publications, Inc., U.S.A.},

abstract={Chlorinated ethenes (CEs) are legacy contaminants whose chemical footprint is expected to persist in aquifers around the world for many decades to come. These organohalides have been reported in river systems with concerning prevalence and are thought to be significant chemical stressors in urban water ecosystems. The aquifer-river interface (known as the hyporheic zone) is a critical pathway for CE discharge to surface water bodies in groundwater baseflow. This pore water system may represent a natural bioreactor where anoxic and oxic biotransformation process act in synergy to reduce or even eliminate contaminant fluxes to surface water. Here, we critically review current process understanding of anaerobic CE respiration in the competitive framework of hyporheic zone biogeochemical cycling fuelled by in-situ fermentation of natural organic matter. We conceptualise anoxic-oxic interface development for metabolic and co-metabolic mineralisation by a range of aerobic bacteria with a focus on vinyl chloride degradation pathways. The superimposition of microbial metabolic processes occurring in sediment biofilms and bulk solute transport delivering reactants produces a scale dependence in contaminant transformation rates. Process interpretation is often confounded by the natural geological heterogeneity typical of most riverbed environments. We discuss insights from recent field experience of CE plumes discharging to surface water and present a range of practical monitoring technologies which address this inherent complexity at different spatial scales. Future research must address key dynamics which link supply of limiting reactants, residence times and microbial ecophysiology to better understand the natural attenuation capacity of hyporheic systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background Many common environmental chemicals are mammary gland carcinogens in animal studies, activate relevant hormonal pathways, or enhance mammary gland susceptibility to carcinogenesis. Breast cancer's long latency and multifactorial etiology make evaluation of these chemicals in humans challenging. Objective For chemicals previously identified as mammary gland toxicants, we evaluated epidemiologic studies published since our 2007 review. We assessed whether study designs captured relevant exposures and disease features suggested by toxicological and biological evidence of genotoxicity, endocrine disruption, tumor promotion, or disruption of mammary gland development. Methods We systematically searched the PubMed database for articles with breast cancer outcomes published in 2006–2016 using terms for 134 environmental chemicals, sources, or biomarkers of exposure. We critically reviewed the articles. Results We identified 158 articles. Consistent with experimental evidence, a few key studies suggested higher risk for exposures during breast development to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dioxins, perfluorooctane-sulfonamide (PFOSA), and air pollution (risk estimates ranged from 2.14 to 5.0), and for occupational exposure to solvents and other mammary carcinogens, such as gasoline components (risk estimates ranged from 1.42 to 3.31). Notably, one 50-year cohort study captured exposure to DDT during several critical windows for breast development (in utero, adolescence, pregnancy) and when this chemical was still in use. Most other studies did not assess exposure during a biologically relevant window or specify the timing of exposure. Few studies considered genetic variation, but the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project reported higher breast cancer risk for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in women with certain genetic variations, especially in DNA repair genes. Conclusions New studies that targeted toxicologically relevant chemicals and captured biological hypotheses about genetic variants or windows of breast susceptibility added to evidence of links between environmental chemicals and breast cancer. However, many biologically relevant chemicals, including current-use consumer product chemicals, have not been adequately studied in humans. Studies are challenged to reconstruct exposures that occurred decades before diagnosis or access biological samples stored that long. Other problems include measuring rapidly metabolized chemicals and evaluating exposure to mixtures. © 2017 The Authors},

It is applied in the context of global projects to reduce the software development life-cycle duration. A number of studies have attempted to aggregate a better understanding of FTS development, but it is still an immature research area. Objective This paper aims to investigate the existing empirical evidence about FTS research with a focus on identifying what research has been conducted in the area and which results have been obtained. Method To achieve this goal, we performed a systematic mapping study to answer our research questions: “Which FTS studies have been published in the literature?” and “What empirical support is provided for them?” We investigated papers published between 1990 and 2017. The synthesis was made through classifying the papers into different categories (research topics, research methods, conferences and journals venues for FTS research, and countries involved in FTS research). Results We selected 57 papers using a predefined search strategy. The majority of the papers discussing FTS were published in the International Conference on Global Software Engineering (ICGSE). The main research topic addressed is processes and organization development for FTS. Case studies combined with the interview as a research sub-method is adopted in the most studies performed in FTS. The majority of the existing research and the most active researchers in this topic are from the United States and Brazil. However, India and the United States are the countries that appear most often in the studies conducted to investigate FTS. Conclusion Our findings suggest that FTS software development is an up-to-date research topic in Software Engineering. However, little information about FTS has been published over the last few years. The emergent need in this research is the development of evaluation research for testing FTS feasibility and effectiveness in practice. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Recent studies have investigated the issue in Asia, but no systematic review has been published to date. This study aims to elucidate the issue by summarizing relevant epidemiologic evidence for cohorts in Asia, using information from the Birth Cohort Consortium of Asia (BiCCA). Environmental pollutants include mercury, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and phthalates. This study sought to classify the effects of such compounds on fetal growth and pregnancy outcomes, neurodevelopment and behavioral problems, allergic disease and immune function and the endocrine system and puberty. These evidences showed ETS has been associated with infant birth weight, children's neurodevelopment and allergy disease; mercury and PCB have been shown to affect children's neurodevelopment; phthalate has effects on endocrine function; PFAS alters children's neurodevelopment, the endocrine system, and the allergic response. However, more consistent and coordinated research is necessary to understand the whole picture of single environmental and/or co-exposure and children's health. Therefore, harmonization and international collaboration are also needed in Asia. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A comprehensive review of the various studies reported in the literature to date on the mathematical modeling of fixed-bed reactors for the production of fuels by the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) was carried out. It is quite clear that most of the proposed models are based on a set of assumptions that allow their wide simplification by reducing the models into forms of low complexity, due to the fact that in most cases the effects of phase equilibrium are neglected, and relatively simple Fischer-Tropsch kinetics of the power law type are used. In addition, most of the proposed modeling schemes neglect the effects of resistances to gas-liquid and liquid-solid mass transfer. On the other hand, few reports consider the energy effects under the consideration of a nonisothermal operation assuming a plug-flow behavior and a gas-liquid system. A generalized model of a fixed-bed FTS reactor is proposed which takes into account all the mass and heat transfer phenomena, as well as hydrodynamics and vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE), based on the information given in the literature. It is evident that for fixed-bed reactors for fuel production using Fischer-Tropsch technology, there is little experimental information for validation and a need to explore different types of reactor models, such as reactor models under a trickle-flow regime considering the effects of phase distribution and dispersion under transient-state conditions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Perfluorinated compounds such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) have recently drawn great attention due to their wide distribution in aquatic environments. The understanding of the physicochemical properties and fate and transport of PFAs in groundwater is still limited. Preliminary studies indicate that these compounds can readily bioaccumulate and pose human and animal health concerns. Due to their physicochemical properties, PFOS and PFOA are water soluble, nonvolatile and persistent in the environment, which is a cause of concern related to their treatment with conventional remediation technologies. Extraction with inefficient carbon adsorption is one of the most common treatment technologies for remediation of PFOS- or PFOA-impacted groundwater. Several other innovative and promising technologies, including sonochemistry, bioremediation and photolysis, have been tested for their effectiveness in removal of perfluorinated compounds. This paper provides a baseline for understanding research needs to better develop treatment technologies for PFOA and PFOS in groundwater. Frontiers for improving the state of practice for PFOA and PFOS treatment include the development of more cost-effective ex situ treatment methods and the development and demonstration of promising in situ treatment technologies at the pilot and full scale. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Endocrine disruptor compounds are exogenous agents able to interfere with a gland function, exerting their action across different functional passages, from the synthesis to the metabolism and binding to receptors of the hormone produced. Several issues, such as different levels and time of exposure and different action across different ages as well as gender, make the study of endocrine disruptors still a challenge. The thyroid is very sensitive to the action of disruptors, and considering the importance of a correct thyroid function for physical and cognitive functioning, addressing this topic should be considered a priority. In this review, we examined the most recent studies, many of them concentrating on maternal and child exposure, conducted to assess the impact of industrial chemicals which showed an influence on thyroid function. So far, the number of studies conducted on that topic is not sufficient to provide solid conclusions and lead to homogeneous guidelines. The lack of uniformity is certainly due to differences in areas and populations examined, the different conditions of exposures and the remarkable inter-subject variability. Nonetheless, the European Commission for Health and Food Safety is implementing recommendations to ensure that substances identified as endocrine disruptors will be withdrawn from the market. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={There is growing evidence from experimental and human epidemiological studies that many pollutants can disrupt lipid metabolism. In Arctic wildlife, the occurrence of such compounds could have serious consequences for seasonal feeders. We set out to study whether organohalogenated compounds (OHCs) could cause disruption of energy metabolism in female polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from Svalbard, Norway (n = 112). We analyzed biomarkers of energy metabolism including the abundance profiles of nine lipid-related genes, fatty acid (FA) synthesis and elongation indices in adipose tissue, and concentrations of lipid-related variables in plasma (cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides). Furthermore, the plasma metabolome and lipidome were characterized by low molecular weight metabolites and lipid fingerprinting, respectively. Polychlorinated biphenyls, chlordanes, brominated diphenyl ethers and perfluoroalkyl substances were significantly related to biomarkers involved in lipid accumulation, FA metabolism, insulin utilization, and cholesterol homeostasis. Moreover, the effects of pollutants were measurable at the metabolome and lipidome levels. Our results indicate that several OHCs affect lipid biosynthesis and catabolism in female polar bears. Furthermore, these effects were more pronounced when combined with reduced sea ice extent and thickness, suggesting that climate-driven sea ice decline and OHCs have synergistic negative effects on polar bears. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Intertrochanteric fractures are common injuries in the elderly. Conventional intramedullary nails including Gamma 3 locking nail and proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) were designed for unstable intertrochanteric fractures. The InterTan (IT) nail system, introduced in 2005, has been reported superior biomechanical and clinical outcomes compared with 1-screw nailing system. However, some recent studies have reported that IT did not improve functional recovery in patients with intertrochanteric fractures. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or prospective cohort studies were included in our meta-analysis. We used the PRISMA guidelines and Cochrane Handbook to evaluate the quality of included studies to ensure that the pooled data of our meta-analysis were reliable and veritable. Our pooled data analysis demonstrated that IT was as effective as the control group in terms of Harris Hip Score (HHS), blood loss, total complications, union time, length of hospital stay, revision rate, and fluoroscopy time. IT shows less implant cut-out rate and femoral fractures when compared with control groups. © 2017 The Author(s).},

Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized control trials involving either enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS)/fast track surgery (FTS) for patients underwent LAG. EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of science, and Cochrane Library were searched. Primary outcomes included the length of postoperative hospital stay, cost of hospitalization, postoperative complications, and readmission rate. Results: Five randomized control trials were eligible for analysis. There were 159 cases in FTS group and 156 cases in conventional care group. Compared with conventional care group, FTS group relates to shorter postoperative hospital stay (WMD - 2.16; 95% CI - 3.05 to - 1.26, P < 0.00001), less cost of hospitalization (WMD - 4.72; 95% CI - 6.88 to - 2.55, P < 0.00001), shorter time to first flatus (WMD - 9.72; 95% CI - 13.75 to - 5.81, P < 0.00001), lower level of C-reaction protein on postoperative days 3 or 4 (WMD - 19.66; 95% CI - 28.98 to - 10.34, P < 0.00001), higher level of albumin on postoperative day 4 (WMD 3.45; 95% CI 2.01 to 4.89, P < 0.00001), and postoperative day 7 (WMD 5.63; 95% CI 1.01 to 10.24, P = 0.02). Regarding postoperative complications, no significant differences were observed between FTS group and conventional care group (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.09, P = 0.10). The readmission rate of FTS group was comparable to conventional care group (WMD 3.14; 95% CI 0.12 to 81.35, P = 0.49). Conclusions: Among patients undergoing LAG, FTS is associated with shorter postoperative hospital stay, rapid postoperative recovery, and decreased cost without increasing complications or readmission rate. The combined effects of the two methods could further accelerate clinical recovery of gastric cancer patients. © 2017 The Author(s).},

Using food consumption and body weight parameters, estimated dietary intakes (EDIs) were calculated for evaluation using the Scenario-Based Risk Assessment (SceBRA) modelling. Among food groups, the highest ΣPFAAs concentrations and EDI contributions were both found in poultry (363 ng/g), fish and shrimp (313 ng/g), dark vegetables (309 ng/g), fruits (116 ng/g) and pork (25 ng/g). The EDI of adults in the high-exposure scenario was about twice that of the intermediate-exposure scenario, while the EDI of children was about twice that of adults’ EDI in the intermediate-exposure scenario. In addition, the PFOS EDI for children under high exposure approached its tolerable daily intake (TDI). Therefore high dietary exposure to PFAAs is giving rise to an increased health risk, especially for children. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Background: Recent evidence shows that patient engagement is an important strategy in achieving a high performing healthcare system. While there is considerable evidence of implementation initiatives in direct care context, there is limited investigation of implementation initiatives in decision-making context as it relates to program planning, service delivery and developing policies. Research has also shown a gap in consistent application of system-level strategies that can effectively translate organizational policies around patient and family engagement into practice. Methods: The broad objective of this initiative was to develop a system-level implementation strategy to include patient and family advisors (PFAs) at decision-making points in primary healthcare (PHC) based on well-established evidence and literature. In this opportunity sponsored by the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement (CFHI) a co-design methodology, also well-established was applied in identifying and developing a suitable implementation strategy to engage PFAs as members of quality teams in PHC. Diabetes management centres (DMCs) was selected as the pilot site to develop the strategy. Key steps in the process included review of evidence, review of the current state in PHC through engagement of key stakeholders and a co-design approach. Results: The project team included a diverse representation of members from the PHC system including patient advisors, DMC team members, system leads, providers, Public Engagement team members and CFHI improvement coaches. Key outcomes of this 18-month long initiative included development of a working definition of patient and family engagement, development of a Patient and Family Engagement Resource Guide and evaluation of the resource guide. Conclusion: This novel initiative provided us an opportunity to develop a supportive system-wide implementation plan and a strategy to include PFAs in decision-making processes in PHC. The well-established co-design methodology further allowed us to include value-based (customer driven quality and experience of care) perspectives of several important stakeholders including patient advisors. The next step will be to implement the strategy within DMCs, spread the strategy PHC, both locally and provincially with a focus on sustainability. © 2017 The Author(s); Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.},

abstract={The marked increase in international terror in recent years requires the development of highly efficient methods to detect trace amounts of explosives at airports, border crossings and check points. The preferred analytical method worldwide is the ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) that is capable of detecting most explosives at the nano-gram level. Sample collection for the IMS analysis is based on swabbing of a passenger's belongings to collect possible explosive residues. The present study examines a wide range of issues related to swab-based particle collection and analysis, in the hope of gaining deeper understanding into this technique that will serve to improve the detection process. The adhesion of explosive particles to three typical materials, plastic, metal and glass, were measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We found that a strong contribution of capillary forces to adhesion on glass and metal surfaces renders these substrates more promising materials upon which to find and collect explosive residues. The adhesion of explosives to different swipe materials was also examined. Here we found that Muslin, Nomex® and polyamide membrane surfaces are the most promising materials for use as swipes. Subsequently, the efficiency of multiple swipe use – for collecting explosive residues from a glass surface using Muslin, Nomex® and Teflon™ swipes – was examined. The study suggests that swipes used in about 5–10 “sampling and analysis cycles” have higher efficiency as compared to new unused swipes. The reason for this behavior was found to be related to the increased roughness of the swipe surface following a few swab measurements. Lastly, GC-MS analysis was employed to examine the nature of contaminants collected by the three types of swipe. The relative amounts of different contaminants are reported. The existence and interference of these contaminants have to be considered in relation to the detection efficiency of the various explosives by the IMS. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Cross-checking was done after assessing the quality of the included trials and extracting the data by two reviewers independently. Data analysis were performed with RevMan 5.3.RESULTS: Two randomized controlled trials and five quasi-randomized controlled trials involving 611 cases met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analyses showed no significant differences between the two methods on Harris scores[MD=-1.00, 95%CI(-2.29, 0.28), P=0.13], union time[MD=0.04, 95%CI (-0.70, 0.77), P=0.92], full weight-bearing time[MD=1.06, 95%CI(-0.29, 2.42), P=0.13], hospital stay[MD=-0.04, 95%CI (-0.52, 0.45), P=0.89] and length of incision[MD=-1.00, 95%CI (-2.64, 0.65), P=0.23]. There were significant differences between the two methods on operative time[MD=-25.75, 95%CI (-37.47, -14.03), P<0.000 1], intraoperative blood loss[MD=-55.67, 95%CI(-108.07, -3.27), P=0.04] and the internal fixation complication rate[MD=4.17, 95%CI (1.33, 13.08), P=0.01].CONCLUSIONS: Both PFNA and InterTAN could provide good effect for intertrochanteric fracture. The operation time of PFNA is shorter than that of InterTAN, and there is less blood loss during operation. PFNA may be the first choice for the treatment of patients who have many complications and can't endure long-time operation. The complications of PFNA are more than those of InterTAN. In patients with long life expectancy and high requirements, InterTAN may be preferentially selected to reduce complications. According to the patient's situation, after a comprehensive consideration, appropriate treatment can be selected.},

abstract={Many emerging pollutants (also known as micro-pollutants) including pesticides, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have frequently been detected in surface, ground, and drinking water at alarming concentrations. The emission and accumulation of these anthropogenic chemicals in nature is a potential threat to human health and aquatic environment. Therefore, it is essential to devise an effective and feasible technology to remove the micro-pollutants from water. Activated carbon adsorption has been introduced and utilized as a promising treatment to reduce the concentration of the emerging pollutants in water. A summary of research on the removal of pesticides, PPCPs, and EDCs by activated carbon adsorption process is presented in this report. The effects of carbon characteristics, adsorptive properties, and environmental factors on the adsorption capacity of activated carbon are reviewed. In addition, the mechanisms of the adsorption including hydrophobicity and the nature of the functional groups of activated carbon and organic compounds are discussed. Furthermore, the applied equilibrium adsorption isotherms (Langmuir, Freundlich, BET, Sips, Dubinin-Astakhov, Dubinin-Radushkevich, and Toth) and the most common kinetic models (pseudo-first- and second-order models, film and intra-particle diffusion models, and adsorption-desorption model) are also included for further investigation. This comprehensive review report aims to identify the knowledge deficiencies regarding emerging pollutant treatment via activated carbon adsorption process and open new horizons for the future research on the adsorption of emerging pollutants on activated carbon. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.},

abstract={The ideal implant for the treatment of an unstable intertrochanteric femoral fracture is still a matter of discussion. The aim of this systematic review is to conduct a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing clinical outcomes between dynamic hip screws (DHS), Medoff sliding plating, percutaneous compression plating (PCCP), proximal femoral nails (PFN), Gamma nails and less invasive stabilization system fixation in femoral trochanteric fractures in the elderly. These clinical outcomes consist of total intra-operative time, intra-operative fluoroscopy time, intra-operative blood loss, blood component transfusion, length of hospital stay, postoperative general complications, wound complications, late complications and reoperation rates. This systematic review was conducted using PubMed and Scopus search engines for RCTs comparing clinical outcomes between treatments from inception to February 22, 2015. Thirty-six of 785 studies identified were eligible. Compared to the other implants, PCCP showed the lowest total operative time and units of blood transfusion with an unstandardized mean difference (UMD) of 29.27 min (95% CI 5.24, 53.50) and 0.89 units (95% CI 0.52, 1.25). The lowest incidence of general complications, wound complications and late complications of PCCP was 0.09 (95% CI 0.04, 0.18), 0.01 (95% CI 0.01, 0.04) and 0.05 (95% CI 0.02, 0.11), respectively, when compared to others. The lowest fluoroscopic time was with DHS with an UMD of 0.24 min (95% CI 0.16, 0.32), whereas the lowest blood loss and shortest hospital stay were with PFN with an UMD of 233.61 ml of blood loss (95% CI 153.17, 314.04) and 7.23 days of hospital stay (95% CI 7.15, 7.31) when compared to all other fixation methods. Reoperation rates of all implants had no statistically significant difference. The network meta-analysis suggested that fixation with PCCP significantly shortens operative time and decreases the units of blood transfusion required, while also lowering risks of general complications, wound complications and late complications when compared to fixation. Use of PFN showed the least intra-operative blood loss and shortest hospital stay. Multiple active treatment comparisons indicate that PCCP fixation in trochanteric fractures in the elderly is the treatment of choice in terms of intra-operative outcomes and postoperative complications. © 2017, Springer-Verlag France.},

abstract={Background: In this review, we examine the continually expanding and increasingly compelling data linking radiation and various chemicals in our environment to the current high incidence of breast cancer. Singly and in combination, these toxicants may have contributed significantly to the increasing rates of breast cancer observed over the past several decades. Exposures early in development from gestation through adolescence and early adulthood are particularly of concern as they re-shape the program of genetic, epigenetic and physiological processes in the developing mammary system, leading to an increased risk for developing breast cancer. In the 8 years since we last published a comprehensive review of the relevant literature, hundreds of new papers have appeared supporting this link, and in this update, the evidence on this topic is more extensive and of better quality than that previously available. Conclusion: Increasing evidence from epidemiological studies, as well as a better understanding of mechanisms linking toxicants with development of breast cancer, all reinforce the conclusion that exposures to these substances - many of which are found in common, everyday products and byproducts - may lead to increased risk of developing breast cancer. Moving forward, attention to methodological limitations, especially in relevant epidemiological and animal models, will need to be addressed to allow clearer and more direct connections to be evaluated. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Purpose of Review: Optimal management of primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) remains a source of debate, and options include observation with or without continuous antibiotic prophylaxis and surgical repair via endoscopic, open, or laparoscopic/robotic approaches. Surgical intervention may be necessary in children with persistent reflux, renal scarring, or recurrent febrile urinary tract infections when other options fail. Recent Findings: Need for surgical correction is dictated predominantly by a given child’s clinical course including risk for recurrent infections and potential for renal scarring. While recent studies suggest that endoscopic injection is effective for the treatment of most VUR, the importance of material injected, technique utilized, reflux grade, and structural/functional bladder anomalies on ultimate success rates must be emphasized. Summary: Long-term clinical success following endoscopic correction of primary VUR is high, and the majority of children avoid additional or more invasive surgical procedures. Efficacy rates are known to vary widely between surgeons, techniques, and implant materials. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are widely used in manufacturing, and they enter the soil by direct and indirect pathways. Thus, there are concerns about their potential effects on soil ecosystems and some studies have monitored EDCs in the soil environment. However, there have been few studies on soil ecotoxicity of EDCs so far compared with aquatic ecotoxicity, and there is no comprehensive review of soil ecotoxicity of EDCs. Therefore, we collected, compiled and reviewed 77 studies on the soil ecotoxicity of seven prominent EDCs: bisphenol A, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), nonylphenols, triclosan, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS). This review brings together the data on soil ecotoxicity and research trends for these seven EDCs and identifies the need for further research to fill the gaps in our knowledge and data. Highlights: Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) pose potential threats to soil ecosystems. Seventy-seven studies on the soil ecotoxicity of seven EDCs were reviewed. There are fewer studies on soil ecotoxicity than on aquatic ecotoxicity. Further research including various environmentally relevant concentrations of EDCs is needed. © 2017 British Society of Soil Science},

abstract={Purpose of Review: Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) are common among older women, and pose a unique challenge to the healthcare provider. The onset of PFDs in older women is gradual resulting from an inter-related process of anatomic, hormonal, and functional changes that occur over time and often impacted by concomitant medical co-morbid conditions. In this evidenced-based review, we provide an update on the epidemiology and provide an evidence-based approach to the evaluation of women with PFDs with a specific focus on the impact of aging. Recent Findings: Physical function impairment is prevalent among older women with pelvic floor symptoms. The decline in physical function is likely the consequence of global changes in skeletal muscle health with aging, but may uniquely impact the pelvic floor muscle physiology and function. Summary: Providers caring for older women with PFDs must account for the impact of the aging process on symptom presentation and evaluation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose of review The purpose of this review is to review the data on the relationship of obesity and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). This review is timely and relevant as the prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide, and it is an important risk factor to consider in counseling women on management of prolapse symptoms and outcomes for surgical treatment. Recent findings The main findings in the literature include: Obesity is increasing worldwide and impacts health, social life, work and healthcare costs. Elevated BMI is an important lifestyle factor affecting pelvic prolapse. The most probable mechanism of POP development among obese women is the increase in intra-abdominal pressure that causes weakening of pelvic floor muscles and fascia. Obesity is associated with significant pelvic floor symptoms and impairment of quality of life (QOL). Weight loss is likely not associated with anatomic improvement, but may be associated with prolapse symptom improvement. Weight loss should be considered a primary option in obese women for its beneficial effects on multiple organ systems and reducing pelvic floor disorder (PFD) symptoms. Although the operation time in obese women is significantly longer than in healthy weight women, the complication rate of surgery has not been shown to be increased compared to nonobese patients, regardless of route of surgery. There are data to support the vaginal approach in obese women. Some studies have shown that women with high body weight are associated with an increase in the risk for both anatomical and functional recurrence, and other studies have shown no difference. Summary Obesity is a prevalent modifiable condition that impacts PFDs including pelvic prolapse. Patients should be counseled using clinical judgment, knowledge of the literature and with the goal of improving QOL. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.},

The estimated prevalence in Germany is 1 % and FASD persists for life. Not only pediatricians and child psychiatrists but also general practitioners, neurologists, psychiatrists, psychotherapists and gynecologists (plus broad areas of pedagogics and social work) are confronted with FASD. Material and methods: Based on a systematic review and methodological assessment of the literature from 2001–2015, the multidisciplinary guideline group formulated consensus recommendations for the diagnosis of FASD. In this publication the differential diagnostic criteria for partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) are presented. Results: The literature search for pFAS, ARND and ARBD resulted in 365 hits and 58 publications were included for the methodological assessment. For the diagnosis of pFAS, two out of three facial anomalies (i.e. short palpebral fissure length, thin upper lip and smooth philtrum), at least three abnormalities of the central nervous system (CNS) and a probable maternal alcohol consumption are required. For the diagnosis of ARND at least three abnormalities of the CNS and a confirmed intrauterine alcohol exposure are necessary. The ARBD is rejected as a separate diagnosis. Conclusion: Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis of FASD that are easily implemented in practice were defined. Regarding treatment and secondary prevention of complications, more research is necessary. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a group of anthropogenic chemicals widely used in manufacture and daily necessities, which are contaminants ubiquitous existed in various environmental matrices and biota. Due to the persistent, bioaccumulative, long-range transport and potential toxic behaviors, production of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid was voluntarily phased out. Perfluorooctanoic acid, its salt and related compounds were also proposed to be included the Stockholm Convention. Restrictions on production and usage of PFAS chemicals have resulted in emergence of novel PFAS compounds through direct manufacturing emissions and indirect transformation pathways, and increasing attention has been focused on these alternatives. In this review, we summarized recent investigations on major groups of emerging PFASs with various molecular structures, and current analytical strategies on the identification of unknown organic fluoride components were overviewed. Four classes of emerging PFASs are covered, including short-chain perfluoroalkyl substances, cyclic perfluoroalkyl acids, perfluoropolyethers and chlorine or hydrogen-substituted polyfluoroalkyl substances. Current knowledge on molecular structures, production and application, environmental behaviors and potential biological effects are summarized, if available. Known PFASs were noticed as a small part of organic fluorinated compounds in the environment. Consequently, new analytical strategies, such as the mass balance analysis and the oxidative conversion methods, were developed for the analysis of unknown fluorinated components. Mass balance analysis of extractable organic fluorine were used to predict the content of unknown organic fluorine in various environmental matrices including sea water, soil, and human blood. Extractable organic fluorine could be exactly quantified after conversion into inorganic fluoride by high-temperature combustion, and known fluorinated components could also be measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The difference in contents between extractable organic fluorine and known fluorinated components was thus considered as components of unknown organic fluorine. The oxidative conversion method was especially superior for the analysis of fluorinated precursors such as fluorotelomer sulfonates, perfluoroalkane sulfonamides and fluorotelomer phosphate diesters, in which these poly-fluoroalkyl substances could be transformed into known perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) by reaction with hydroxyl radicals at basic conditions. The content of polyfluoroalkyl precursors could be determined by comparing the change of PFCAs contents before and after the oxidation assay. Compared with the mass balance analysis method, this oxidative conversion method require quantification of more PFAS terminal products, and it was not applicable for stable perfluorinated compounds. Meanwhile, occurrence of a variety of novel PFAS analogues have brought challenges on PFAS analysis. For instance, varied molecular structures of emerging PFASs result in distinct physical-chemical properties, which further complicate the analytical process including sample pretreatment and chromatographic isolation. Development of additional methods, such as hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) for the analysis of short chain PFASs and orthogonal liquid chromatography for the analysis of zwitterionic, cationic, and anionic fluorinated chemicals, are urgently needed. Statistical tools including mass spectrum deconvolution, peak picking, alignment and feature filtering would be promising for confirmation of novel PFAS molecular structures. Also, environmental transformation of PFAS precursors are still ambiguous. Application of strategies in metabolomics analysis might facilitate studies on degradation mechanism of PFAS chemicals. © 2017, Science Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={This study explores biological chlorine cycling in coastal Arctic wet tundra soils. While many previous chlorine-cycling studies have focused on contaminated environments, it is now recognized that chlorine can cycle naturally between inorganic and organic forms in soils. However, these pathways have not previously been described for an Arctic ecosystem. We measured soil organic and inorganic Cl pools, characterized soils and plant tissues with chlorine K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (Cl-XANES), measured dechlorination rates in laboratory incubations, and analyzed metagenomes and 16S rRNA genes along a chronosequence of revegetated drained lake basins. Concentrations of soil organic chlorinated compounds (Clorg) were correlated with organic matter content, with a steeper slope in older soils. The concentration and chemical diversity of Clorg increased with soil development, with Clorg in younger soils more closely resembling that of vegetation, and older soils having more complex and variable Cl-XANES signatures. Plant Clorg concentrations were higher than previously published values, and can account for the rapid accumulation of Clorg in soils. The high rates of Clorg input from plants also implies that soil Clorg pools turn over many times during soil development. Metagenomic analyses revealed putative genes for synthesis (haloperoxidases, halogenases) and breakdown (reductive dehalogenases, halo-acid dehalogenases) of Clorg, originating from diverse microbial genomes. Many genome sequences with close similarity to known organohalide respirers (e.g. Dehalococcoides) were identified, and laboratory incubations demonstrated microbial organohalide respiration in vitro. This study provides multiple lines of evidence for a complex and dynamic chlorine cycle in an Arctic tundra ecosystem. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

An extensive search for toxicological information in rats and mice, and a systematic search for epidemiological evidence were conducted. The linear regression coefficient (LRC) of birth weight (BrthW) on PFOA/PFOS was considered, and separate random effects meta-analyses for untransformed (i.e. not mathematically transformed) and log-transformed values were performed. Toxicological evidence: PFOA: 12 studies (21 datasets) in mice showed statistically significant lower birth/fetal weights from 5 mg/kg body weight per day. PFOS: most of the 13 studies (19 datasets) showed lower birth/fetal weights following in utero exposure. Epidemiological evidence: Sixteen articles were considered. The pooled LRC for a 1 ng/mL increase in untransformed PFOA (12 studies) in maternal plasma/serum was −12.8 g (95% CI −23.2; 2.4), and −27.1 g (95% CI −50.6; −3.6) for an increase of 1 loge ng/mL PFOA (nine studies). The pooled LRC for untransformed PFOS (eight studies) was −0.92 g (95%CI −3.4; 1.6), and for an increase of 1 loge ng/mL was −46.1(95% CI −80.3; −11.9). No consistent pattern emerged for study location or timing of blood sampling. Conclusions: Epidemiological and toxicological evidence suggests that PFOA and PFOS elicit a decrease in BrthW both in humans and rodents. However, the effective animal extrapolated serum concentrations are 102–103 times higher than those in humans. Thus, there is no quantitative toxicological evidence to support the epidemiological association, thus reducing the biological plausibility of a causal relationship. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

A growing body of literature also addresses health effects in children exposed to PFAS. This review summarizes the epidemiologic evidence for relationships between prenatal and/or childhood exposure to PFAS and health outcomes in children as well as to provide a risk of bias analysis of the literature. A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed for studies on PFAS and child health outcomes. We identified 64 studies for inclusion and performed risk of bias analysis on those studies. We determined that risk of bias across studies was low to moderate. Six categories of health outcomes emerged. These were: immunity/infection/asthma, cardio-metabolic, neurodevelopmental/attention, thyroid, renal, and puberty onset. While there are a limited number of studies for any one particular health outcome, there is evidence for positive associations between PFAS and dyslipidemia, immunity (including vaccine response and asthma), renal function, and age at menarche. One finding of note is that while PFASs are mixtures of multiple compounds few studies examine them as such, therefore the role of these compounds as complex mixtures remains largely unknown. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={Due to the dynamic developmental processes during pregnancy, infancy, childhood and adolescence, exposure to PFASs is hypothesized to have the most pronounced negative effects during this period. In this review we critically evaluate the current state of the science regarding human early life exposure processes (until 18 years of age) to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Efficient placental transfer of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) results in relatively high prenatal exposure compared with many neutral organic contaminants. The few biomonitoring studies that specifically target infants, toddlers and other children suggest relatively high serum concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in early life with peak concentrations occurring sometime before the child reaches 20 months. This peak in serum concentrations is most likely explained by exposure via breastfeeding, ingestion of house dust and/or specific contact events with consumer products leading to high body weight normalized estimated daily intakes (EDIs). Although children have higher EDIs of PFASs than adults, these are not always reflected by higher serum levels of PFASs in children in cross-sectional biomonitoring studies due to the confounding effect of age and birth cohort, and different exposure histories due to production changes. Longitudinal exposure studies measuring internal and external exposure (for multiple pathways and PFASs) at several time points during early life are strongly encouraged to understand temporal changes in exposure of individual children. A better quantitative understanding of early life exposure processes would help to improve the validity of epidemiological studies and allow informed decisions regarding setting of regulatory thresholds and appropriate mitigation actions. © 2017 The Authors},

However, PFDs in women in low/middle-income countries (LMICs) have not been studied extensively. We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to determine the prevalence of, and/or risk factors for, PFDs in women in LMIC. Methods and analysis: We will search electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Maternity &amp; Infant Care and Google Scholar for eligible studies. Inclusion criteria will be observational studies of healthy women, which have collected data using validated or non-validated tools, are published in English and were conducted in community women in LMICs, defined by the World Bank. A standardised data extraction form will be developed and piloted, based on the template of the Cochrane good practice data extraction form. All included studies will be assessed based on a risk-of-bias tool specifically developed for prevalence studies. Pooled prevalence estimates of PFDs will be generated using RevMan V.5.2.1 software. Forest plots will be generated to display the overall random-effects pooled estimates with CIs. A metaregression will be conducted to identify sources of between-study heterogeneity in the pooled prevalence estimates. We will quantify heterogeneity using the I2 measure and its CI. We will use funnel plots to detect potential reporting biases and small-study effects. We will also conduct a sensitivity analysis to verify the robustness of the study conclusions, assessing the impact of methodological quality, study design, sample size and the effect of missing data. Ethics and dissemination: Our review is entirely based on published data. Thus, an ethics committee approval or written informed consent will not be required for this study as primary data will not be collected. The results will be disseminated by publication of the manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal and/or will be presented at relevant conferences. © 2017 Article author(s).},

The purpose of this review is to summarize updated evidence for optimal preoperative assessment, perioperative management, and postoperative care for elective gynecologic surgery in older women. Recent Findings: Two joint best-practice guideline statements from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) and the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) focus on preoperative (2012) and perioperative care (2016) of the geriatric patient. Summary: Preoperative identification of frailty, cognitive impairment, and functional disability in older women may be an important way to improve outcomes. Preoperative identification has the potential to allow surgeons to better counsel patients about unique postoperative risks, tailor the aggressiveness of the surgical approach, and facilitate shared decision-making. Finally, preoperative identification can help identify patients who need extra support at hospital discharge with transitions of care. Future research is necessary to assess the impact of preoperative geriatric screening for frailty, cognitive impairment, and mobility disorders with treatment success and postoperative outcomes in older women undergoing surgical correction of pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) and other elective gynecologic procedures. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Levodopa and carbidopa are small polar molecules, posing challenges in the development of selective and efficient chromatography conditions. Perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPA), a volatile ion-pairing agent, was utilized to enhance chromatographic characteristics of both compounds in the reversed-phase mechanism. The ion-pairing chromatography played an essential role in mitigating matrix effects and achieving adequate separation between interfering background peaks and those of the analytes of interest, especially for levodopa. A 96-well based, automated liquid-liquid extraction, via the use Hamilton NIMBUS liquid handlers, was developed. Butyl alcohol, when mixed with ethyl acetate, greatly increased the recovery of both levodopa and carbidopa. The addition of PFPA further enhanced recovery for both analytes. Sodium metabisulfite, an antioxidant, was used to stabilize levodopa and carbidopa in rat plasma. The method was validated in the ranges of 50–10,000 ng/mL and 25–5000 ng/mL for levodopa and carbidopa, respectively, using levodopa-d3 and carbidopa-d3 as internal standards. The validated method was successfully applied to analyze rat plasma samples from in-life studies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) have been documented in high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs). However, the rate of association between STICs and HGSOCs and, therefore, the fraction of HGSOCs that are likely to have originated from the fallopian tube (FT), has remained unclear. Objective: To appraise the literature describing the association between STICs and established HGSOCs. Search strategy: Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Selection criteria: Studies were included if they evaluated the frequency of STICs in HGSOCs, and were published in an English peer-reviewed journal. Data collection and analysis: Appropriate studies were evaluated for their compliance with the ‘Strengthening and Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)’ criteria. Main results: Ten articles met the study selection criteria. The reported coexistence between STICs and HGSOCs ranged from 11% to 61% (mean: 31%, 95% CI: 17–46%). STICs were rarely found in other gynaecological cancers. Small sample size, lack of objective criteria to identify STICs and the retrospective nature of the studies contributed to the variability in reporting the rate of the association. Conclusions: STICs were identified commonly in the FTs of women with HGSOC. Finding the true rate of association between STICs and HGSOCs will require further investigations. While there is evidence that a fraction of HGSOCs arise from the FTs, an accurate estimate of that fraction remains to be determined. The lack of an accurate estimate of the association makes it difficult to evaluate the potential magnitude of reduction of HGSOCs following prophylactic salpingectomy. Tweetable abstract: A systematic review of the incidence of STICs in HGSOCs identifies significant methodological inconsistencies. © 2017 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists},

Cancer influences the important metabolic pathways and the changes in metabolite levels had been used in many studies as the potential biomarkers. This study is aimed at screening metabolite biomarkers with CRC diagnosis potentials. The direct infusion mass spectrometry (MS) metabolomic analysis based on dried blood spot was used to distinguish CRC from polyp. The target metabolites were composed of 23 amino acids and 26 acylcarnitines. The 21 metabolites in blood were selected via multivariate analysis. A regression model was established based on parameters C16, Arg, C4/C8, C5/C3, Val, Phe/Tyr, Ala, C4/C3. Tenfold cross validation (CV) method was used to test this model and showed sensitivity of 81.18% and specificity of 83.95%. The metabolomic analysis is a practicable method for CRC detection. The use of direct MS analysis in metabolite screening could be finished in several minutes and served as a higher-throughput method to distinguish CRC and polyps. © 2017 IUBMB Life, 69(5):347–354, 2017. © 2017 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology},

abstract={Background Patellofemoral pain (PFP) occurs frequently, and may be related to patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). Obesity is associated with increased risk of knee OA. This systematic review involves a meta-regression and analysis to determine the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and PFP and PFOA, and to determine the link between BMI and interventional outcomes. Methods We searched seven electronic databases and reference lists of relevant papers and systematic reviews, for cross-sectional, prospective, human-based observational and interventional studies reporting BMI in individuals with PFP or PFOA compared to healthy controls. Two independent reviewers appraised methodological quality (epidemiological appraisal instrument). Where possible, data from prospective studies were pooled to conduct meta-regression and case-control, and intervention studies to conduct meta-analysis using the following categories: adolescents with PFP, adults with PFP and PFOA. Results 52 studies were included. We found greater BMI in adults with PFP (standardised mean difference: 0.24, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.36) and PFOA (0.73, 0.46 to 0.99) compared to healthy controls, but not in adolescents with PFP (-0.19,-0.56 to 0.18). We also observed statistical trends (p<0.10) towards higher BMI being a predictor for development of PFP in adults (0.34,-0.04 to 0.71). No significant link between BMI and intervention outcomes in adults with PFP was identified. Conclusions Higher BMI is present in PFP and PFOA, but not in adolescents with PFP.

abstract={Naturally produced halogenated compounds are ubiquitous across all domains of life where they perform a multitude of biological functions and adopt a diversity of chemical structures. Accordingly, a diverse collection of enzyme catalysts to install and remove halogens from organic scaffolds has evolved in nature. Accounting for the different chemical properties of the four halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) and the diversity and chemical reactivity of their organic substrates, enzymes performing biosynthetic and degradative halogenation chemistry utilize numerous mechanistic strategies involving oxidation, reduction, and substitution. Biosynthetic halogenation reactions range from simple aromatic substitutions to stereoselective C-H functionalizations on remote carbon centers and can initiate the formation of simple to complex ring structures. Dehalogenating enzymes, on the other hand, are best known for removing halogen atoms from man-made organohalogens, yet also function naturally, albeit rarely, in metabolic pathways. This review details the scope and mechanism of nature's halogenation and dehalogenation enzymatic strategies, highlights gaps in our understanding, and posits where new advances in the field might arise in the near future. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

The researches on environmental pollution and health risk of PFCs have become the hot subject in recent years. The advanced and reliable analytical methods for determination of PFCs are urgently needed since various homologs and isomers of PFCs are detected at trace levels (ng g−1 or μg L−1) in environment. At present, studies on analytical methods of trace PFCs in environmental samples have been extensively carried out in China and abroad. However, reviews which systematically discuss the sample pretreatment, analytical method, and matrix effect of determination of PFCs in complex environmental matrixes are hardly available. Therefore, the present review highlights the pretreatment methods, matrix effects, and detection techniques (especially isomers) of PFCs in environmental samples (water, sediment, sludge, soil and plant). It hopes that this review will provide valuable references for the environmental researches on PFCs. © 2017 Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences},

Activation of the complement system via classical, lectin, or alternative pathways generates anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) and membrane attack complex (C5b-9) and opsonizes targeted cells. Complement activation end products and their receptors mediate cell-cell interactions that regulate several biological functions in the extravascular tissue. Signaling of anaphylatoxin receptors or assembly of membrane attack complex promotes cell dedifferentiation, proliferation, and migration in addition to reducing apoptosis. As a result, complement activation in the tumor microenvironment enhances tumor growth and increases metastasis. In this Review, I discuss immune and nonimmune functions of complement proteins and the tumor-promoting effect of complement activation.},

abstract={Background The developing fetus and pregnant woman can be exposed to a variety of environmental chemicals that may adversely affect their health. Moreover, environmental exposure and risk disparities are associated with different social determinants, including socioeconomic status (SES) and demographic indicators. Our aim was to investigate whether and how maternal concentrations of a large panel of persistent and non-persistent environmental chemicals vary according to sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics in a large pregnancy and birth cohort. Methods Data were analyzed from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, a cohort of pregnant women (N = 2001) recruited over four years (2008–2011) in 10 cities across Canada. In all, 1890 urine and 1938 blood samples from the first trimester (1st and 3rd trimester for metals) were analysed and six sociodemographic and lifestyle indicators were assessed: maternal age, household income, parity, smoking status, country of birth and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Results We found these indicators to be significantly associated with many of the chemicals measured in maternal blood and urine. Women born outside Canada had significantly higher concentrations of di-2-ethylhexyl and diethyl phthalate metabolites, higher levels of all metals except cadmium (Cd), as well as higher levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and legacy organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Nulliparity was associated with higher concentrations of dialkyl phosphates (DAPs), arsenic, dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and many of the persistent organic pollutants. Smokers had higher levels of bisphenol A, Cd and perfluorohexane sulfonate, while those women who had never smoked had higher levels of triclosan, DMAA, manganese and some OCPs. Conclusion Our results demonstrated that inequitable distribution of exposure to chemicals among populations within a country can occur. Sociodemographic and lifestyle factors are an important component of a thorough risk assessment as they can impact the degree of exposure and may modify the individual's susceptibility to potential health effects due to differences in lifestyle, cultural diets, and aging. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Persistent organic pollutants, such as perfluorinated alkylated substances (PFASs) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are widespread in the environment and most of them are bioaccumulated in wildlife and humans. The present study is the first investigation to reveal the PFAS and BFR levels of serum samples in the adult population of the Czech Republic. Altogether, 300 serum samples from blood donors in four cities were examined. In all samples 19 PFASs and 33 BFRs, including some of their metabolites, were targeted. The analyses were performed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry or gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (according to the type of analyte). PFASs, with the carbon chain length C6 and higher, dominated in all samples. Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS; median: 2.43 ng/mL), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; median: 0.756 ng/mL), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA; median: 0.145 ng/mL) and perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS; median: 0.184 ng/mL) were detected in 100% of samples. Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA; median: 0.325 ng/mL) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA; median: 0.058 ng/mL) in 99.7% and 96.0% of samples, respectively. We observed statistically significant associations (p < 0.05) between selected PFAS concentrations and the locality, gender, age of donors and education level. None of the BFRs was detected above the LOQ in more than 9% of the samples. The most frequently detected representatives of this group were congeners of polybrominated diphenyl ethers, namely BDE-47 (in 8.7%; range: 0.496–5.44 ng/g lipid weight (l.w.)), BDE-99 (in 6.0%; range: 0.706–9.46 ng/g l.w.), BDE-153 (in 7.3%; range: 0.736–6.44 ng/g l.w.) and BDE-209 (in 7.0%; range: 13.7–2693 ng/g l.w.). © 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Objectives/Hypothesis: To report two patients with a history of microvascular decompression (MVD) for hemifacial spasm who presented with Teflon granulomas (TG) mimicking cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumors and to perform a systematic review of the English-language literature. Study Design: Case series at a single tertiary academic referral center and systematic review. Methods: Retrospective chart review with analysis of clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings. Systematic review using PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases. Results: Two patients with large skull base TGs mimicking CPA tumors clinically and radiographically were managed at the authors' institution. The first presented 4 years after MVD with asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss, multiple progressive cranial neuropathies, and brainstem edema due to a growing TG. Reoperation with resection of the granuloma confirmed a foreign-body reaction consisting of multinucleated giant cells containing intracytoplasmic Teflon particles. The second patient presented 11 years after MVD with asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss and recurrent hemifacial spasm. No growth was noted over 2 years, and the patient has been managed expectantly. Only one prior case of TG after MVD for hemifacial spasm has been reported in the English literature. Conclusions: TG is a rare complication of MVD for hemifacial spasm. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients presenting with a new-onset enhancing mass of the CPA after MVD, even when performed decades earlier. A thorough clinical and surgical history is critical toward establishing an accurate diagnosis to guide management and prevent unnecessary morbidity.

Research and progress on PFSAs, especially when considered with their applications, are at the forefront of bridging electrochemistry and polymer (physics), which have also opened up development of state-of-the-art in situ characterization techniques as well as multiphysics computation models. Topics reviewed stem from correlating the various physical (e.g., mechanical) and transport properties with morphology and structure across time and length scales. In addition, topics of recent interest such as structure/transport correlations and modeling, composite PFSA membranes, degradation phenomena, and PFSA thin films are presented.

abstract={Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) has been commonly used for the determination of macromolecules owing to the high sensitivity and convenience. However, the direct analysis of small molecule with MALDI-TOF-MS remains a challenge due to the matrix interference in the low mass region. In this paper, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs: MOF-5, MOF-235, Cu-btc MOFs and Uio-66(Zr)-2OH) were successfully used as both adsorbent and significant matrix of MALDI-TOF-MS method for the analysis of small molecule pollutants. Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) were chosen as model analytes to investigate the matrix function of MOFs with LDI measurement in positive and negative reflection mode, respectively. As a result, MOFs exhibit high laser desorption/ionization efficiency and function well in both positive-ion and negative-ion modes. Compared to the MS spectra with conventional matrices, MS spectra obtained on MOFs matrix are only featured by deprotonated molecule ion peaks without background interference. Furthermore, MOFs, with large surface area and π-π stacking structure, can also enrich trace amounts of small molecule pollutants from solution efficiently and quickly. According to these, we developed a simple method in which MOFs-solid-phase extraction (SPE) enrichment was combined with MALDI-TOF-MS to realize the direct analysis of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) in real water samples. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Lipophilic persistent organic pollutants (POP) are stored in adipose tissue. Following rapid weight loss such as when induced by bariatric surgery, an increased release of potential harmful lipophilic compounds into the blood circulation may occur. Weight reduction is recommended for overweight and obese individuals in order to decrease risk of weight-related health problems. However, in cases of significant weight reduction POP become mobilized chemicals and consequently may adversely affect health, including endocrine disruption. The objective of the present investigation was to estimate quantitatively the level of mobilization of POP following weight loss over time. According to literature search criteria, 17 studies were identified with 2061 participants. Data from 5 of the studies with 270 participants were used to assess the change in blood levels of POP in percent per kilogram weight loss. Weight loss in the included studies varied from 4.4 to 64.8 kg. In all studies, the majority of POP concentrations in blood were found to rise following weight reduction. Blood concentrations following weight reduction were elevated by 2–4% per kilogram weight loss for most POP examined. The increased POP levels were still elevated 12 mo after intervention. Most research in this field, including animal studies, is carried out on a single compound or group of selected compounds, not taking the “cocktail effect” into consideration. This does not reflect the true range of POP to which humans are actually exposed. Few chronic investigations have been published and, in particular, few studies were available that compared the increase in POP concentrations with clinical consequences as individuals lost weight. These limitations call for caution in interpreting results. The benefits of losing weight still far outweigh the potential adverse health risks. However, further studies are recommended to determine the clinical significance of increased blood levels of POPs following rapid and excessive weight loss, particularly for women attending weight reduction treatment before pregnancy. © 2016, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © Aina Jansen, Jan L.

abstract={Numerous contemporary incidents demonstrate that conventional control strategies for municipal tap water have limited ability to mitigate exposures to chemicals whose sources are within distribution systems, such as lead, and chemicals that are not removed by standard treatment technologies, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)/perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). In these situations, point-of-use (POU) controls may be effective in mitigating exposures and managing health risks of chemicals in drinking water, but their potential utility has not been extensively examined. As an initial effort to fill this information gap, we conducted a critical review and analysis of the existing literature and data on the effectiveness of POU drinking water treatment technologies for reducing chemical contaminants commonly found in tap water in the United States. We found that many types of water treatment devices available to consumers in the United States have undergone laboratory testing and often certification for removal of chemical contaminants in tap water, but in most cases their efficacy in actual use has yet to be well characterized. In addition, the few studies of POU devices while “in use” focus on traditional contaminants regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, but do not generally consider nontraditional contaminants of concern, such as certain novel human carcinogens, industrial chemicals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and flame retardants. Nevertheless, the limited information available at present suggests that POU devices can be highly effective when used prophylactically and when deployed in response to contamination incidents. Based on these findings, we identify future areas of research for assessing the ability of POU filters to reduce health-related chemical contaminants distributed through public water systems and private wells. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are persistent organic pollutants in the environment and have serious health risks, including endocrine disrupting properties, immunotoxicity and developmental effects etc. The photochemical degradation has been proven to be a low-cost, efficient and sustainable technology for the removal of PFOX (X = A or S) in water. At present, most of the investigations have been conducted in ultrapure water and at concentrations much higher comparing to those detected in the real wastewaters. Furthermore, there are few studies about the toxicity of treated water. In this paper, the state of knowledge on the photocatalytic degradation of PFOX, including photo-oxidative and photo-reductive degradation, is reviewed comprehensively. Compared with photo-oxidation, photo-reduction appears to be more suitable for the PFOX removal since it is more favorable for the defluorination of PFOX and further complete mineralization. The effects of key parameters on the photocatalytic degradation and defluorination process of PFOX are commendably accessed, such as light wavelength, photocatalyst concentration, initial PFOX concentration, pH, reaction atmosphere, temperature, and coexisting organic or inorganic matters. The mechanisms of PFOX photodegradation process are also elucidated in detail. This paper will help to deeply understand PFOX decomposition process and put forward better perspectives in the future for researchers who work in this field. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Introduction Thyroid hormones (THs) are especially important for brain maturation and development during the fetal period and childhood. Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and thyroid outcomes during the early stages of life. We aimed to review this evidence. Methods We conducted a systematic review in compliance with the PRISMA Statement (search conducted in PubMed and Embase, as well as in the citations of the selected articles). We chose studies if they dealt with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin (T4), or thyroid dysfunctions, and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measured in the blood of pregnant women and/or children up to 19 years old. Results We included in this review three cross-sectional, one case-control, and six cohort studies (publication: 2011–2015), focusing on prenatal life (n = 7), childhood (n = 2) or both periods (n = 1). We observed a high degree of heterogeneity across studies in terms of sampling time (different gestational weeks, at birth, or childhood), outcomes, adjustment for potential confounders, and statistical approach. We found some evidence of a positive association between PFHxS and PFOS exposure and TSH levels measured in maternal blood, and PFNA and TSH levels measured in the blood of boys aged ≥ 11 years. Conclusion Although there is a small number of studies with comparable data, we found some consistency of a positive association between maternal or teenage male exposure to some PFAS and TSH levels based on the current literature. However, further studies are required to confirm these possible relationships. © 2016 The Authors},

In the last 10 years, their detection and remediation have progressed significantly. Herein, we critically review recent developments in electrochemical advanced oxidation process (EAOP) towards their remediation. Particular attentions are paid to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which present the main concerns of PFASs at this time. Due to the persistence of those PFASs, other remediation approaches may experience difficulty in degrading them, whilst EAOP has demonstrated success. The fundamentals of EAOP are highlighted and the scale-up application is discussed regarding the future research directions. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.},

abstract={Background Primary hemiarthroplasty was recommended by some surgeons as the preferred choice in treating unstable senile intertrochanteric fractures with osteoporosis. However, many studies reported that proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) currently was as an optimal implant for the treatment of different type of intertrochanteric fractures. Which method is better for treating senile intertrochanteric fractures remains controversial due to the insufficient clinical evidences. Methods We reviewed all consecutive senile intertrochanteric fractures treated with PFNA or cemented hemiarthroplasty at our institution between July 2010 and March 2015. The primary outcome measures were postoperative complications, reoperation rate and hip function. The secondary outcome measures were intraoperative blood loss, transfusion rate, surgical time, postoperative hemoglobin, hospital stay and 1- year mortality. Results Seventy-one patients in PFNA group and 52 patients in hemiarthroplasty group were included for analysis. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding to the orthopaedic complications, reoperation rate, surgical time and Harris Hip Score at 1 year follow-up. Significant differences were found between PFNA and hemiarthroplasty group in comparison of intraoperative blood loss (P < 0.001), transfusion rate, medical complications (P = 0.037) and hospital stay (P = 0.001). Patients treated with hemiarthroplasty had a trend of higher postoperative 1- year mortality compared to those underwent PFNA but this was statistically not significant (P = 0.134). Conclusions These findings indicate that PFNA has obvious advantages over hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of senile intertrochanteric fractures. Hemiarthroplasty in treating these fractures is associated with greater surgical trauma and higher incidence of postoperative medical complications. © 2017},

abstract={Background Environmental chemical exposures have been implicated in pediatric kidney disease. No appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic. Methods We performed a systematic review of the epidemiologic studies that assessed association of environmental exposures with measures of kidney function and disease in pediatric populations. The search period went through July 2016. Results We found 50 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. Environmental exposures reviewed herein included lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, fluoride, aflatoxin, melamine, environmental tobacco, bisphenol A, dental procedures, phthalates, ferfluorooctanoic acid, triclosan, and thallium/uranium. Most studies assessed environmental chemical exposure via biomarkers but four studies assessed exposure via proximity to emission source. There was mixed evidence of association between metal exposures, and other non-metal environmental exposures and pediatric kidney disease and other kidney disease biomarkers. The evaluation of causality is hampered by the small numbers of studies for each type of environmental exposure, as well as lack of study quality and limited prospective evidence. Conclusion There is a need for well-designed epidemiologic studies of environmental chemical exposures and kidney disease outcomes. © 2017},

Endoscopic correction with Deflux is minimally invasive, well tolerated, and provides cure rates approaching those of open surgery (i.e., approximately 80% in several studies). However, in recent years a less stringent approach to evaluating urinary tract infections (UTIs) and concerns about long-term efficacy and complications associated with endoscopic injection have limited the use of this therapy. In addition, there is little evidence supporting the efficacy of endoscopic injection therapy in preventing UTIs and vesicoureteral reflux-related renal scarring.

abstract={Although strictly anaerobic conditions prevail in several environmental compartments, up to now, biodegradation studies with emerging organic contaminants (EOCs), such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, have mainly focused on aerobic conditions. One of the reasons probably is the assumption that the aerobic degradation is more energetically favorable than degradation under strictly anaerobic conditions. Certain aerobically recalcitrant contaminants, however, are biodegraded under strictly anaerobic conditions and little is known about the organisms and enzymatic processes involved in their degradation. This review provides a comprehensive survey of characteristic anaerobic biotransformation reactions for a variety of well-studied, structurally rather simple contaminants (SMOCs) bearing one or a few different functional groups/structural moieties. Furthermore it summarizes anaerobic degradation studies of more complex contaminants with several functional groups (CMCs), in soil, sediment and wastewater treatment. While strictly anaerobic conditions are able to promote the transformation of several aerobically persistent contaminants, the variety of observed reactions is limited, with reductive dehalogenations and the cleavage of ether bonds being the most prevalent. Thus, it becomes clear that the transferability of degradation mechanisms deduced from culture studies of SMOCs to predict the degradation of CMCs, such as EOCs, in environmental matrices is hampered due the more complex chemical structure bearing different functional groups, different environmental conditions (e.g. matrix, redox, pH), the microbial community (e.g. adaptation, competition) and the low concentrations typical for EOCs. © 2017 The Authors},

Legislation mandating the establishment of water resources monitoring, presence of hazardous contaminants in effluents, and perception of the vulnerability of the water distribution system to attacks, have spurred technical and economic interest. Alternatively to traditional analyzers, chemosensors operate according to physical principles, without sample collection (online), and are capable of supplying parameter values continuously and in real-time. This review paper contains a comprehensive survey of existing and expected online monitoring technologies for measurement/detection of pollutants in water. The state-of-the-art in online water monitoring and contaminant warning systems is presented. Application examples are reported.

abstract={A method for the lipid analysis of Chinese cabbage leaves was developed by ultra performance liquid chromatography-time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF-MS/MS). The lipid species, structures, fatty acid compositions and relative contents in Chinese cabbage leaves were elucidated. Acquity UPLCTM BEH C8 column was selected as the stationary phase. A fast and efficient chromatographic separation was accomplished within 22 min. TOF-MS scan-information dependent acquisition-product ion scan was performed in ESI positive and negative ion modes to acquire high resolution MS and MS/MS spectra in one injection. Finally, 232 lipids in Chinese cabbage leaves were identified, including 104 phospholipids, 63 glycolipids and 65 glycerides. Among them, phosphatidylcholines and monogalactosyldiacylglycerols were chiefly phospholipids and glycolipids, respectively. Meanwhile, glycerides mainly contained diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols. The results demonstrated that the method for lipid analysis has high sensitivity, good accuracy and high throughput. It provides a reliable analysis platform for lipid metabolism in plants and lay a foundation for further study on biological functions of lipids.},

abstract={Objective: The aim of this study was to establish if enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) and fast track surgery (FTS) protocols are associated with reduction in healthcare-associated infection (HAIs). Background: Evidence suggests that prevention strategies for HAIs should be multifaceted and transdisciplinary. ERAS and FTS protocols are collaborative approaches to perioperative care which reduce length of stay but may also be an effective strategy for reducing HAIs. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials involving either ERAS or FTS for abdominal or pelvic surgery. Primary outcome included postoperative incidence of 3 major HAIs: lung infection (LI), urinary tract infection (UTI), and surgical site infection (SSI). Results: Among all included trials, ERAS/FTS was associated with a significant reduction in postoperative LI [risk ratio (RR) = 0.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-0.61; P < 0.0001; I2 = 0%], UTI (RR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.23-0.76; P=0.004; I2 =0%), and SSI (RR=0.75; 95% CI=0.58-0.98; P = 0.04; I2 = 0%) compared with conventional controls. Sensitivity analysis performed following the exclusion of high risk of bias publications did not appreciably affect these results. ERAS/FTS was also associated with a significant decrease in hospital length of stay (standard mean difference =-0.83; 95% CI=-0.92 to -0.75; P < 0.0001; P for heterogeneity <0.0001, I2 = 93%). Subgroup analysis of trials involving colorectal surgery and open incision also resulted in significant reduction in all 3 HAIs among ERAS/FTS compared with conventional counterparts. Conclusions: Our results suggest ERAS/FTS protocols are powerful tools to prevent HAIs. Further study is needed to establish the mechanism. Providers should consider adoption of similar transdisciplinary programs to reduce perioperative HAIs and at the same time improve the value of surgical care.

abstract={Co- and terpolymers of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) are ubiquitous in terms of commercial fluoropolymers, and the preparations, properties and applications of these outstanding materials have been well documented in monographs, book chapters, review articles, and the patent and scientific journal literature. The purpose of this chapter is not to cover these major commercial materials again, but rather to overview what is known in the patent and scientific journal literature about research-level TFE-based fluoropolymers and some of those TFE-based fluoropolymers that are available only at a minor commercial level. Since our research group represents one of the few academic laboratories that can safely work with TFE on a kilogram scale, it behooves us to be aware of the scientific literature in this field, and it was an instructive exercise for the coauthors to undertake this literature review. As certainly perfluoroalkyl trifluorovinyl ethers, especially CF2CFOCF3 and CF2CFOCF2CF2CF3, have a prominent place in commercial co- and terpolymers of TFE (e.g. PFA resins, fluoroelastomers), it was decided to begin this chapter with an overview of co- and terpolymers of TFE with all alkyl vinyl ethers, non-fluorinated, partially fluorinated and perfluorinated alkyl vinyl ethers, including those with a reactive functionality(ies) on the end of the alkyl group. We then move to a coverage of co- and terpolymers of TFE with ethylenic monomers, again non-fluorinated, partially fluorinated and perfluorinated ethylenic monomers, with the obvious exclusion of major commercial TFE-based fluoropolymers such as ETFE, FEP and others. The final section is devoted to overviewing co- and terpolymers of TFE with cyclic monomers, an area that became especially important in the 2000s as fluoropolymer chemistry attempted to aid the continuance of Moore's law with improved materials for photoresists, etc. Overall, the accompanying literature survey is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to provide as comprehensive a review as possible within the space available. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.},

abstract={User-authored annotations of data can support analysts in the activity of hypothesis generation and sensemaking, where it is not only critical to document key observations, but also to communicate insights between analysts. We present annotation graphs, a dynamic graph visualization that enables meta-analysis of data based on user-authored annotations. The annotation graph topology encodes annotation semantics, which describe the content of and relations between data selections, comments, and tags. We present a mixed-initiative approach to graph layout that integrates an analyst's manual manipulations with an automatic method based on similarity inferred from the annotation semantics. Various visual graph layout styles reveal different perspectives on the annotation semantics. Annotation graphs are implemented within C8, a system that supports authoring annotations during exploratory analysis of a dataset. We apply principles of Exploratory Sequential Data Analysis (ESDA) in designing C8, and further link these to an existing task typology in the visualization literature. We develop and evaluate the system through an iterative user-centered design process with three experts, situated in the domain of analyzing HCI experiment data. The results suggest that annotation graphs are effective as a method of visually extending user-authored annotations to data meta-analysis for discovery and organization of ideas. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Objective Surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) associated with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia is challenging. We analyze the treatments for this disease, discussing the advantages and drawbacks, and present our own technique and series. Methods This retrospective study covered the period January 2006 through January 2016. Vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia deviation from midline, basilar artery (BA) and vertebral artery diameter, and BA apex distance above the posterior clinoid process were measured on preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. The BA was repositioned and kept in place with coagulation of the clival dura, Teflon pledgets, and fibrin glue. We also performed a thorough literature review using PubMed. Results Our cases included 5 men and 3 women with mean age 64.88 years ± 10.32 (range, 48–81 years); 7 cases were TN, and 1 case was painful tic convulsif. Pain was on the left side in 6 cases and on the right in 2 cases. All cases affected cranial nerve V2 and/or V3 divisions. Both V2 and V3 were affected in 4 cases, V3 was affected in 3 cases, and V2 was affected in 1 case. Hypertension was present in 5 cases. TN disappeared postoperatively in all cases. One patient took clonazepam 2 mg/24 hours for 3 months because of facial dysesthesia. Postoperative complications included hearing loss in 1 patient; facial paresis plus diplopia in 1 patient, which resolved in 3 months; and arterial hypertension. Postoperative arterial hypertension improved in all affected patients, although only 2 patients discontinued antihypertensive medications. Mean follow-up time was 56.50 months ± 40.08 (range, 14 months to 9 years 9 months). No patient showed pain recurrence. Conclusions TN associated with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia can be treated surgically with minimal morbidity. BA repositioning has the highest success rate. Our technique of inducing a dural scar to fix the BA in its new position away from the trigeminal nerve is simple, not technically demanding, and highly effective. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

Treatment is associated with morbidity and may not be totally satisfactory. Prevention of PFDs, when possible, should be a primary goal. The purpose of this paper is to summarise the current literature and give an evidence-based review of the prevention of PFDs Methods: A working subcommittee from the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) Research and Development (R&D) Committee was formed. An initial document addressing the prevention of PFDs was drafted, based on a review of the English-language literature. After evaluation by the entire IUGA R&D Committee, revisions were made. The final document represents the IUGA R&D Committee Opinion on the prevention of PFDs. Results: This R&D Committee Opinion reviews the literature on the prevention of PFDs and summarises the findings with evidence-based recommendations. Conclusions: Pelvic floor disorders have a long latency, and may go through periods of remission, thus making causality difficult to confirm. Nevertheless, prevention strategies targeting modifiable risk factors should be incorporated into clinical practice before the absence of symptomatology. © 2016, The International Urogynecological Association.},

We used a co-culture model combining the motor neuron-like cell line NSC-34 and the astrocyte clone C8-D1A, with each over-expressing wild-type or G93C mutant human SOD1, to examine amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) physiology. We focused on the effects of mutant human SOD1 as well as oxidative stress induced by menadione on intracellular metabolism using a metabolomics approach through gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Preliminary non-supervised analysis by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that cell type, genetic environment, and time of culture influenced the metabolomics profiles. Supervised analysis using orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) on data from intracellular metabolomics profiles of SOD1G93C co-cultures produced metabolites involved in glutamate metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle. This study revealed the feasibility of using a metabolomics approach in a cellular model of ALS. We identified potential disruption of the TCA cycle and glutamate metabolism under oxidative stress, which is consistent with prior research in the disease. Analysis of metabolic alterations in an in vitro model is a novel approach to investigation of disease physiology. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

We measured the concentrations of 59 potentially harmful chemicals in 77 maternal and 65 paired umbilical cord blood samples collected in San Francisco during 2010-2011, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs), and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in serum and metals in whole blood. Consistent with previous studies, we found evidence that concentrations of mercury (Hg) and lower-brominated PBDEs were often higher in umbilical cord blood or serum than in maternal samples (median cord:maternal ratio > 1), while for most PFCs and lead (Pb), concentrations in cord blood or serum were generally equal to or lower than their maternal pair (median cord:maternal ratio ≤ 1). In contrast to the conclusions of a recent review, we found evidence that several PCBs and OCPs were also often higher in cord than maternal serum (median cord:maternal ratio > 1) when concentrations are assessed on a lipid-adjusted basis. Our findings suggest that for many chemicals, fetuses may experience higher exposures than their mothers and highlight the need to characterize potential health risks and inform policies aimed at reducing sources of exposure. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The production of higher terminal alcohols through CO hydrogenation according to the Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) process has been a topic of interest since the Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP) demonstrated short-chain C1–C6 mixed alcohols production over cobalt–copper based catalysts. A number of catalyst formulations were screened for their suitability at that time. In particular, the addition of Cr, Zn, Al, Mn and V to CoCu was investigated. In a number of patents, it was shown that catalyst preparation is crucial in these catalyst formulations and that high alcohols selectivity can only be achieved by carefully respecting the procedures and recipes. This short critical review highlights recent developments in CoCu-based catalysts for higher terminal alcohols synthesis via F–T synthesis. Special attention will be given to catalyst preparation which according to developments in our group is based on oxalate precipitation. This way we show that the close association of Co and Cu on the one hand and promoter/dispersant on the other are of utmost importance to ensure high performance of the catalysts. We shall concentrate on “CoCuMn”, “CoCuMo” and “CoCuNb” catalyst formulations, all prepared via oxalate precipitation and combined with “entrainment techniques” if necessary, and show high total alcohols selectivity can be obtained with tunable Anderson-Schulz-Flory chain-lengthening probability.

abstract={Introduction: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a common congenital cardiac abnormality and that has been associated with several disease processes including transient ischemic attacks (TIA), stroke, migraine headaches with aura, decompression sickness, platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome, and shunt induced cyanosis. Controversy exists regarding closure of PFO as a therapeutic treatment modality for these disease processes. This review addresses the contemporary clinical indications for PFO closure. Areas covered: We conducted a comprehensive literature search of contemporary research studies focusing on randomized trials and meta-analyses comparing medical therapy and device closure of PFOs for the treatment of PFO associated clinical syndromes. We synthesized this literature into a review addressing indications for PFO closure in stroke, TIA, migraine headaches with aura, decompression sickness, platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome, and shunt induced cyanosis. Expert commentary: Because in many PFO associated conditions it can be difficult to determine the degree to which the PFO is a causative factor in the disease process, we recommend a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to exclude other obvious etiologies of PFO associated conditions before implicating the PFO and proceeding with closure. However in the properly selected patient population there is growing clinical experience and experimental evidence suggesting that closure of PFO is a safe and effective treatment modality. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Indiscriminate use of synthetic chemical compounds and the unregulated presence of heavy metals threatens the integral reproducibility of mankind and other living organisms. The toxicity of these compounds far outweighs the usefulness of these compounds. Male reproductive health is linked to the process of spermatogenesis and there is a general consensus that males are more sensitive to these environmental contaminants and so significantly affected when compared to their female counterparts. The review discusses the various toxic contaminants polluting the environment and the effect of these compounds on spermatogenesis and its relevance on male infertility in humans. It provides a detailed report on the chemical nature of few selected reprotoxicants like estrogen analogues, phthalates, dioxins, heavy metals and their action mechanism on various cellular targets that play a role in spermatogenesis with special highlights at the genetic and molecular levels. Understanding the toxicity of these compounds serves a dual purpose; to develop counter measures to protect ourselves from cellular damage and to use these compounds as a model to better understand the intricate process of spermatogenesis. The review would also help researchers formulate stringent regulations and usage restrictions in the synthesis of new compounds. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Complementary to traditional state-of-the-art techniques evaluated elsewhere, this review additionally evaluates less conventional approaches for sample pretreatment, preconcentration, on- and offline detection, size characterisation and quantification of MNPs in environmental samples. Preconcentration techniques, like cloud point extraction and solid phase extraction, provide high preconcentration factors and recoveries. Electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry opens interesting perspectives in the still unresolved distinction between dissolved ions and nanoparticles. Combination of single particle ICP-MS with size fractionation techniques, like hydrodynamic chromatography or electrospray-differential mobility analysis, is highly promising for assessment of shape and structure-related information of MNPs and their aggregates. Although highly relevant, the validation and production of reference materials and quantitative criteria on measurement certainty still require further development. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

This model has been widely used by investigators to study the biology of the TJ and the BTB. Studies have shown that environmental toxicants (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), bisphenol A (BPA) and cadmium) that exert their disruptive effects to induce Sertoli cell injury using this in vitro model are reproducible in studies in vivo. Thus, this in vitro system provides a convenient approach to probe the molecular mechanism(s) underlying toxicant-induced testis injury but also to provide new insights in understanding spermatogenesis, such as the biology of cell adhesion, BTB restructuring that supports preleptotene spermatocyte transport, and others. Herein, we provide a brief and critical review based on studies using this in vitro model of Sertoli cell cultures using primary cells isolated from rodent testes vs. humans to monitor environmental toxicant-mediated Sertoli cell injury. In short, recent findings have shown that environmental toxicants exert their effects on Sertoli cells to induce testis injury through their action on Sertoli cell actin- and/or microtubule-based cytoskeleton. These effects are mediated via their disruptive effects on actin- and/or microtubule-binding proteins. Sertoli cells also utilize differential spatiotemporal expression of these actin binding proteins to confer plasticity to the BTB to regulate germ cell transport across the BTB. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Greater knowledge of biotransformation rates for ionizable organic compounds (IOCs) in fish is required to properly assess the bioaccumulation potential of many environmentally relevant contaminants. In this study, we measured in vitro hepatic clearance rates for 50 IOCs using a pooled batch of liver S9 fractions isolated from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The IOCs included four types of strongly ionized acids (carboxylates, phenolates, sulfonates, and sulfates), three types of strongly ionized bases (primary, secondary, tertiary amines), and a pair of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). Included in this test set were several surfactants and a series of beta-blockers. For linear alkyl chain IOC analogues, biotransformation enzymes appeared to act directly on the charged terminal group, with the highest clearance rates for tertiary amines and sulfates and no clearance of QACs. Clearance rates for C12-IOCs were higher than those for C8-IOC analogues. Several analogue series with multiple alkyl chains, branched alkyl chains, aromatic rings, and nonaromatic rings were evaluated. The likelihood of multiple reaction pathways made it difficult to relate all differences in clearance to specific molecular features the tested IOCs. Future analysis of primary metabolites in the S9 assay is recommended to further elucidate biotransformation pathways for IOCs in fish. (Figure Presented). © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are found widespread in the environment and humans. The relation of PFASs to fertility has now been examined in a relatively large number of epidemiologic studies and a synthesis is in order. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFASs and measures of human fertility, with particular emphasis on perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Systematic literature searches were initially conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE and subsequently in references and citations of included papers. Studies were included if they assessed exposure to PFASs in biological samples in relation to reproductive hormones, semen characteristics, or time to pregnancy (TTP). Study characteristics and results were abstracted to predefined forms, and the studies were assessed for the risk of bias and confounding. Sixteen studies investigated the association between PFAS exposure in men and semen parameters, reproductive hormone levels, or TTP. There was a lack of consistent results among the numerous investigated exposure-outcome combinations. However, subtle associations between higher PFOS and lower testosterone or abnormal semen morphology cannot be excluded. Eleven studies assessed the association between PFAS exposure in women and TTP or reproductive hormones levels. Four of eight studies found prolonged TTP with higher PFOS or PFOA, but only one study found an association when restricting to nulliparous women. In men, there is little evidence of an association between PFAS exposure and semen quality or levels of reproductive hormones. For PFOS and PFOA, the literature indicates an association with female fecundability in parous women, which is most likely not causal. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Indoor dust is a reservoir for commercial consumer product chemicals, including many compounds with known or suspected health effects. However, most dust exposure studies measure few chemicals in small samples. We systematically searched the U.S. indoor dust literature on phthalates, replacement flame retardants (RFRs), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), synthetic fragrances, and environmental phenols and estimated pooled geometric means (GMs) and 95% confidence intervals for 45 chemicals measured in ≥3 data sets. In order to rank and contextualize these results, we used the pooled GMs to calculate residential intake from dust ingestion, inhalation, and dermal uptake from air, and then identified hazard traits from the Safer Consumer Products Candidate Chemical List. Our results indicate that U.S. indoor dust consistently contains chemicals from multiple classes. Phthalates occurred in the highest concentrations, followed by phenols, RFRs, fragrance, and PFASs. Several phthalates and RFRs had the highest residential intakes. We also found that many chemicals in dust share hazard traits such as reproductive and endocrine toxicity. We offer recommendations to maximize comparability of studies and advance indoor exposure science. This information is critical in shaping future exposure and health studies, especially related to cumulative exposures, and in providing evidence for intervention development and public policy. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Objective: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the associations of knee alignment or trochlear morphology (measured on imaging) with presence, severity, onset, and/or progression of patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). Methods: We prospectively registered our protocol with PROSPERO (International prospective register of systematic reviews) and followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to report this review. We searched 10 electronic databases, screened citing articles, and reviewed reference lists. We extracted data and evaluated methodologic quality. Due to study design heterogeneity, we used a best-evidence synthesis to summarize the evidence. Results: We included 16 publications (2,892 participants, 66% women) after removing 4 papers that did not meet our threshold for methodologic quality. There were 11 cross-sectional and 5 longitudinal papers. The target population was knee OA in 11 studies, PFOA in 2 studies, and other knee conditions in 3 studies. Alignment or morphology was measured using radiographs in 8 studies, magnetic resonance imaging in 7 studies, and computed tomography in 2 papers. Limitations include substantial heterogeneity in samples and methods, short followup times in longitudinal studies, and a small number of studies that specifically recruited participants with PFOA. Conclusion: There is strong evidence that PFOA is associated with both trochlear morphology and frontal plane knee alignment, while evidence is limited but consistent in the sagittal and axial planes. These findings suggest that alignment should be evaluated clinically in individuals with PFOA. Clinical interventions targeting knee alignment warrant further investigation. © 2016, American College of Rheumatology},

Overall, 39 metabolically relevant transcription factors were significantly enriched (31 by p,p′-DDE, 10 by PCB-153, 8 by PFOA, and 2 by PFOS). These included the glucocorticoid receptor (p,p′-DDE and PCB-153) and the progesterone receptor (PFOA and PFOS). The ‘insulin receptor signaling’, ‘acute phase response signaling’, ‘Interleukin(IL)-6 signaling’, and ‘prolactin signaling’ pathways were significantly enriched in relation to p,p′-DDE. Transcriptional changes at birth suggest a role for specific metabolic targets as a link between prenatal EDC exposure and metabolic disorders later in life. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

Fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (PAPs) are known to degrade to terminal perfluorinated acids and toxic reactive intermediates through metabolic pathways. Therefore, it is important to characterize their human exposure by the identification of unique biomarkers. With the use of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-time-of-flight analysis (LC-MS-TOF), we developed a workflow for the identification of metabolites for the 8:2 FTOH and 8:2 diPAP. Analysis of serum and urine of dosed rats indicated the 8:2 FTOH-sulfate and the 8:2 diPAP as potential biomarkers. These compounds, as well as 25 other fluorinated compounds and metabolites, were analyzed in human serum and urine samples from the general population (n = 100) and office workers (n = 30). The 8:2 FTOH-sulfate was measured for the first time in human samples in 5 to 10% of the serum samples, ranging from 50 to 80 pg/mL. The 8:2 diPAP was measured in 58% of the samples, ranging from 100 to 800 pg/mL. This study indicates the FTOH-sulfate conjugate as a biomarker of exposure to FTOHs and PAPs in humans. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

A fishing strategy was developed based on untargeted profiling among full scan acquisition datasets provided by high resolution mass spectrometry. Since large datasets arise from such profiling, filtering useful information stands as a central question. In this way, we took advantage of the exact mass differences between Cl and Br isotopes. Indeed, our workflow involved an innovative Visual Basic for Applications script aiming at pairing features according to this mass difference, in order to point out potential organohalogenated clusters, preceded by an automated peak picking step based on the centWave function (xcms package of open access R programming environment). Then, H/Cl-scale mass defect plots were used to visualize the datasets before and after filtering. The filtering script was successfully applied to a dataset generated upon liquid chromatography coupled to ESI(−)-HRMS measurement from one eel muscle extract, allowing for realistic manual investigations of filtered clusters. Starting from 9789 initial obtained features, 1994 features were paired in 589 clusters. Hexabromocyclododecane, chlorinated paraffin series and various other compounds have been identified or tentatively identified, allowing thus broad screening of organohalogenated compounds in this extract. Although realistic, manual review of paired clusters remains time consuming and much effort should be devoted to automation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Root and shoot traits were screened under low and 'normal' phosphate (Pi) supply using a 'pouch and wick' system, and had been screened previously in an agar based system. The P-efficient parent Ningyou7 had a shorter primary root length (PRL), greater lateral root density (LRD) and a greater shoot biomass than the P-inefficient parent Tapidor under both treatments and growth systems. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis identified a total of 131 QTL, and QTL meta-analysis found four integrated QTL across the growth systems. Integration reduced the confidence interval by ∼41%. QTL for root and shoot biomass were co-located on chromosome A3 and for lateral root emergence were co-located on chromosomes A4/C4 and C8/C9. There was a major QTL for LRD on chromosome C9 explaining ∼18% of the phenotypic variation. QTL underlying an increased LRD may be a useful breeding target for P uptake efficiency in Brassica. © The Author(s) 2016.},

We also analyze the effective parameters that can affect the dispersion behavior of a thin dielectric slab waveguide embedded in a symmetric metal film. Three kinds of metal (silver, gold, and copper) with Johnson-Christy constants have been utilized in waveguides. Four kinds of dielectric material (air, Teflon, FR-4, and silicon) have been employed in the insulator layer of the metal-insulator- metal waveguide. The dispersion curve of the metal-insulator-metal waveguide with different metal and dielectric arrangements has been studied numerically. By multi-nominal fitting of dispersion curves, we have derived the nonlinear properties of Gaussian (chirped) wave propagation, dispersion length, and pulse broadening through a three-layer plasmonic waveguide. A comparison of three-layered plasmonic waveguides with different guiding layers has been accomplished. Simulation results have shown that dispersion curves with a larger peak and a quasibound mode cause the Gaussian waves to be dispersed and broadened during longer traveling distances. The achieved results serve an impressive function in the design of optical switches and delay lines. © 2017 Optical Society of America.},

abstract={Several perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been identified as chemicals of concern in the environment due to their persistence, global ubiquity, and classification as reproductive and developmental toxicants, endocrine disrupters, and possible carcinogens. Multiple PFASs are often found together in the environment due to product manufacturing methods and abiotic and biotic transformations. Treatment methods are needed to effectively sequester or destroy a variety of PFASs from groundwater, drinking water, and wastewater. This review presents a comprehensive summary of several categories of treatment approaches: (1) sorption using activated carbon, ion exchange, or other sorbents, (2) advanced oxidation processes, including electrochemical oxidation, photolysis, and photocatalysis, (3) advanced reduction processes using aqueous iodide or dithionite and sulfite, (4) thermal and nonthermal destruction, including incineration, sonochemical degradation, sub-or supercritical treatment, microwave-hydrothermal treatment, and high-voltage electric discharge, (5) microbial treatment, and (6) other treatment processes, including ozonation under alkaline conditions, permanganate oxidation, vitamin-B12 and Ti(III) citrate reductive defluorination, and ball milling. Discussion of each treatment technology, including background, mechanisms, advances, and effectiveness, will inform the development of cost-effective PFAS remediation strategies based on environmental parameters and applicable methodologies. Further optimization of current technologies to analyze and remove or destroy PFASs below regulatory guidelines is needed. Due to the stability of PFASs, a combination of multiple treatment technologies will likely be required to effectively address real-world complexities of PFAS mixtures and cocontaminants present in environmental matrices. © 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

Carbon-supported single metal catalysts (Co/C, Fe/C), bimetallic formulations (Co–Fe/C), and ternary (Co–Fe–Mo and Co–Fe–Ni) systems have been considered in this work. SPS has been selected because it simultaneously allows for: (1) atomizing and generating metallic nanoparticles; (2) creating particularly Fe carbides, which are important in Fe-based FTS reaction mechanism; (3) in situ production of the nanometric graphitic-carbon matrix; and (4) saving time in catalyst synthesis, limiting sample preparation steps and eliminating post synthesis treatment before use. Porosity measurements by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method indicate that the samples are essentially non-porous.

abstract={The brain pathology in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) indicates marked and ongoing inflammatory reactivity with concomitant neuronal damage. These findings are suggestive of neuronal insult as a result of external factors, rather than some type of developmental mishap. Various xenobiotics have been suggested as possible causes of this pathology. In a recent review, the top ten environmental compounds suspected of causing autism and learning disabilities were listed and they included: lead, methyl-mercury, polychorinated biphenyls, organophosphate pesticides, organochlorine pesticides, endocrine disruptors, automotive exhaust, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and perfluorinated compounds. This current review, however, will focus specifically on mercury exposure and ASD by conducting a comprehensive literature search of original studies in humans that examine the potential relationship between mercury and ASD, categorizing, summarizing, and discussing the published research that addresses this topic. This review found 91 studies that examine the potential relationship between mercury and ASD from 1999 to February 2016. Of these studies, the vast majority (74%) suggest that mercury is a risk factor for ASD, revealing both direct and indirect effects. The preponderance of the evidence indicates that mercury exposure is causal and/or contributory in ASD. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Tunable filter Raman spectroscopy is used to efficiently produce Raman excitation maps of unpurified and type-purified single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Maps with fine excitation resolution (1 nm) are created over a wide wavelength range (727 to 980 nm), extending from metallic to semiconducting resonances. At a given wavelength, the wide bandwidth (&gt;3,000 cm–1) allows the comparison of the G band with the radial breathing mode (RBM), and shows the 2D band and other less prominent bands. Materials examined included unsorted powders, aqueous sorted semiconductors, aqueous sorted metals, and polyfluorene sorted semiconductors in toluene. The Raman excitation profiles of the G band are broad, relative to the RBM bands. The maps offer evidence of minority species contamination, except in the case of the polyfluorene sorted semiconductors. Tunable Raman spectroscopy data help validate the simpler fixed wavelength Raman spectroscopy approaches to purity assessment.

abstract={Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a hepato-toxicant and potential non-genotoxic carcinogen, was widely used in industrial and commercial products. Recent studies have revealed the ubiquitous occurrence of PFOS in the environment and in humans worldwide. The widespread contamination of PFOS in human serum raised concerns about its long-term toxic effects and its potential risks to human health. Using fatty liver mutant foie gras (fgr-/-)/transport protein particle complex 11 (trappc11-/-) and PFOS-exposed wild-type zebrafish embryos as the study model, together with RNA sequencing and comparative transcriptomic analysis, we identified 499 and 1414 differential expressed genes (DEGs) in PFOS-exposed wild-type and trappc11 mutant zebrafish, respectively. Also, the gene ontology analysis on common deregulated genes was found to be associated with different metabolic processes such as the carbohydrate metabolic process, glycerol ether metabolic process, mannose biosynthetic process, de novo' (Guanosine diphosphate) GDP-l-fucose biosynthetic process, GDP-mannose metabolic process and galactose metabolic process. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis further highlighted that these deregulated gene clusters are closely related to hepatitis, inflammation, fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver cells, suggesting that PFOS can cause liver pathogenesis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in zebrafish. The transcriptomic alterations revealed may serve as biomarkers for the hepatotoxic effect of PFOS. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Spectroscopic catalogues, such as GEISA and HITRAN, do not yet include information on the water vapour continuum that pervades visible, infrared and microwave spectral regions. This is partly because, in some spectral regions, there are rather few laboratory measurements in conditions close to those in the Earth's atmosphere; hence understanding of the characteristics of the continuum absorption is still emerging. This is particularly so in the near-infrared and visible, where there has been renewed interest and activity in recent years. In this paper we present a critical review focusing on recent laboratory measurements in two near-infrared window regions (centred on 4700 and 6300 cm−1) and include reference to the window centred on 2600 cm−1 where more measurements have been reported. The rather few available measurements, have used Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTS), cavity ring down spectroscopy, optical-feedback – cavity enhanced laser spectroscopy and, in very narrow regions, calorimetric interferometry. These systems have different advantages and disadvantages. Fourier Transform Spectroscopy can measure the continuum across both these and neighbouring windows; by contrast, the cavity laser techniques are limited to fewer wavenumbers, but have a much higher inherent sensitivity. The available results present a diverse view of the characteristics of continuum absorption, with differences in continuum strength exceeding a factor of 10 in the cores of these windows. In individual windows, the temperature dependence of the water vapour self-continuum differs significantly in the few sets of measurements that allow an analysis. The available data also indicate that the temperature dependence differs significantly between different near-infrared windows. These pioneering measurements provide an impetus for further measurements. Improvements and/or extensions in existing techniques would aid progress to a full characterisation of the continuum – as an example, we report pilot measurements of the water vapour self-continuum using a supercontinuum laser source coupled to an FTS. Such improvements, as well as additional measurements and analyses in other laboratories, would enable the inclusion of the water vapour continuum in future spectroscopic databases, and therefore allow for a more reliable forward modelling of the radiative properties of the atmosphere. It would also allow a more confident assessment of different theoretical descriptions of the underlying cause or causes of continuum absorption. © 2016 The Author(s)},

Water Framework Directive mandating the establishment of Member States’ water resources monitoring, presence of hazardous contaminants in effluents, and perception of vulnerability of water distribution system to attacks, have spurred technical and economic interests. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – As alternative to traditional analyzers, chemosensors, operate according to physical principles, without sample collection (online), and are capable of supplying parameter values continuously and in real-time. Their low selectivity and stability issues have been overcome by technological developments. This review paper contains a comprehensive survey of existing and expected online monitoring technologies for measurement/detection of pollutants in water. Findings – The state-of-the-art in online water monitoring is presented. Application examples are reported. Monitoring costs will become a lesser part of a water utility budget due to the fact that automation and technological simplification will abate human cost factors, and reduce the complexity of laboratory procedures. Originality/value – An overview of applicable instrumentation, and forthcoming developments, is given. Technological development in this field is very rapid, and astonishing advances are anticipated in several areas (fingerprinting, optochemical sensors, biosensors, molecular techniques). Online monitoring is becoming an ever-important tool not only for compliance control or plant management purposes, but also as a useful approach to pollution control and reduction, minimizing the environmental impact of discharges. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The capacity to communicate effectively with other individuals plays a critical role in the daily life of an individual and can have important fitness consequences. Animals rely on a number of visual and non-visual signals, whose production brings costs to the individual. The theory of honest signaling states that these costs are higher for low than for high-quality individuals, which prevents cheating and makes signals, such as skin and plumage coloration, indicators of individual's quality or condition. The condition-dependent nature of signals makes them ideally suited as indicators of environmental quality, implying that signal production might be affected by contaminants. In this mini-review article, we have made the point that oxidative stress (OS) is one overlooked mechanism linking exposure to contaminants to signaling because (i) many contaminants can influence the individual's oxidative balance, and (ii) generation of both visual and non-visual signals is sensitive to OS. To this end, we have provided the first comprehensive review on the way both non-organic (heavy metals, especially mercury) and organic [persistent organic pollutants (POPs)] contaminants may influence either OS or sexual signaling. We have also paid special attention to emerging classes of pollutants like brominated flame-retardants (BFRs) and perfluoroalkoxy alkanes (PFAs) in order to stimulate research in this area. We have finally provided suggestions and warnings for future work on the links among OS, sexual signaling, and contaminant exposure. © 2016 Marasco and Costantini.},

abstract={The incidence of childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other forms of metabolic disease have been rising over the past several decades. Although diet and physical activity play important roles in these trends, other environmental factors also may contribute to this significant public health issue. In this article, we discuss the possibility that widespread exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may contribute to the development of metabolic diseases in children. We summarize the epidemiological evidence on exposure to environmental chemicals during early development and metabolic outcomes in infants and children. Prenatal exposure to EDCs, particularly the persistent organic pollutant DDT and its metabolite DDE, may influence growth patterns during infancy and childhood. The altered growth patterns associated with EDCs vary according to exposure level, sex, exposure timing, pubertal status, and age at which growth is measured. Early exposure to air pollutants also is linked to impaired metabolism in infants and children. As a result of these and other studies, professional health provider societies have called for a reduction in environmental chemical exposures. We summarize the resources available to health care providers to counsel patients on how to reduce chemical exposures. We conclude with a discussion of environmental policies that address chemical exposures and ultimately aim to improve public health. © 2016 Mosby, Inc.},

This study extends these observations by investigating the molecular mechanisms of action underlying the beneficial metabolic effects of the analogue [Arg4]tigerinin-1R in mice with diet-induced obesity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. The study also investigates the electrophysiological effects of the peptide on KATP and L-type Ca2+ channels in BRIN-BD11 clonal β cells. Non-fasting plasma glucose and glucagon concentrations were significantly (p&lt;0.05) decreased and plasma insulin increased by twice daily treatment with [Arg4]tigerinin-1R (75 nmol/kg body weight) for 28 days. Oral and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance were significantly (p&lt;0.05) improved accompanied by enhanced secretion and action of insulin. The peptide blocked KATP channels and, consistent with this, improved beta cell responses of isolated islets to a range of secretagogues. Peptide administration resulted in up-regulation of key functional genes in islets involved insulin secretion (Abcc8, Kcnj11, Cacna1c and Slc2a2) and in skeletal muscle involved with insulin action (Insr, Irs1, Pdk1, Pik3ca, and Slc2a4). These observations encourage further development of tigerinin-1R analogues for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. © 2016 by De Gruyter.},

abstract={This review discusses the evidence linking industrial chemicals to a variety of health and reproductive outcomes. Industrial chemical production has increased over the past 30 to 40 years. Basic science, animal models, and epidemiologic data suggest that certain chemicals may act as endocrine disruptors (substances that interfere with normal hormonal action) and may play an etiologic role in a number of conditions whose incidence has also increased during this same period. These include low birth weight, gestational diabetes, obesity, certain cancers, certain birth defects, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit disorder and autism. In addition, some environmental chemicals may have epigenetic effects, resulting in transgenerational health impacts. The epidemiologic and experimental evidence that links chemicals such as plasticizers (eg, phthalates and phenols), flame retardants, perfluorinated compounds, and pesticides with adverse reproductive health outcomes is reviewed. Women's health care providers are the liaison between scientific research and their patients; they should educate themselves on the significance of environmental toxins to health. They are ideally positioned, not only to counsel and reassure pregnant women, but also to suggest practicable changes in dietary and lifestyle habits to improve their health. Furthermore, women's health care providers should advocate for regulatory changes that protect women and their families from the health effects of environmental toxins. © 2016 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives},

This review aims to provide a broad summary of this literature, comparing the state of epidemiological evidence for the effects of a wide range of environmental contaminants (air pollutants, heavy metals, organochlorine compounds, perfluoroalkyl substances, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, pesticides, phthalates and bisphenol A) on child health outcomes. The review addresses effects on foetal growth and prematurity, neurodevelopment, respiratory and immune health, and childhood growth and obesity. Findings of recent prospective studies and meta-analyses have corroborated previous good evidence, often at lower exposure levels, for effects on foetal growth of air pollution and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), for neurotoxic effects of lead, methylmercury, PCBs and organophosphate pesticides, and for respiratory health effects of air pollution. Moderate evidence has emerged for a potential role of environmental pollutants in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism (lead, PCBs, air pollution), respiratory and immune health (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene - DDE - and PCBs), and obesity (DDE). In addition, there is now moderate evidence that certain chemicals of relatively recent concern may be associated with adverse child health outcomes, specifically perfluorooctanoate and foetal growth, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers and neurodevelopment. For other chemicals of recent concern, such as phthalates and bisphenol A, the literature is characterised by large inconsistencies preventing strong conclusions. In conclusion, since most of the recent literature evaluates common exposures in the general population, and not particularly high exposure situations, this accumulating body of evidence suggests that the unborn and young child require more protection than is currently provided. Large, coordinated research efforts are needed to improve understanding of long-term effects of complex chemical mixtures. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.},

While ideally applied to evidence synthesized in systematic reviews and corresponding summary tables, such as evidence profiles, GRADE's correct application requires that “the evidence that was assessed and the methods that were used to identify and appraise that evidence should be clearly described.” In this article, we suggest that GRADE could be applied to evidence assembled from narrative reviews, modelled (indirect) evidence, or evidence assembled as part of a rapid response, if the underlying judgments about the certainty in this evidence are based on the relevant GRADE domains and provided transparently. Health questions that require assessing the certainty in a body of evidence to provide trustworthy answers may range from hours, to days or weeks, to a few months to scenarios that allow assessing evidence without short-term time pressures. Time frames of emergent, urgent or rapid evidence assessments will often require relying on existing summaries or rapidly compiling the available evidence and making assessments. Even without available full systematic reviews, expressing the certainty in the evidence can provide useful guidance for users of the evidence and those who evaluate certainty in effects. The ratings also help clarifying disagreement between organizations tackling similar questions about the evidence. Using the structured GRADE domains, narrative or other summaries of the evidence can be presented transparently. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Using literature from the past 30 years (N = 159), we conducted a meta-analysis of organic contaminants (OCs) in Chinese sludge. Most data were available from developed and populated regions, and no data were found for Tibet. Since 1987, 35 classes of chemicals consisting of 749 individual compounds and 1 mixture have been analyzed, in which antibiotics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were the most targeted analytes. For 13 classes of principal OCs (defined as chemicals detected in over five studies) in sludge, the median (expressed in nanograms per gram dry weight) was the highest for phthalate esters (27 900), followed by alkylphenol polyethoxylates (12 000), synthetic musks (5800), antibiotics (4240), PAHs (3490), ultraviolet stabilizers (670), bisphenol analogs (160), organochlorine pesticides (110), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (100), pharmaceuticals (84), hormones (69), perfluorinated compounds (21), and polychlorinated biphenyls (15). Concentrations of PAHs in sludges collected between 1998 and 2012 showed a decreasing trend.

A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) source was applied for the detection of DB213 and benzamidine (Internal Standard). The analytes were quantified by using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with m/z 333.4 → 86.1 and m/z 121.2 → 104 for DB213 and benzamidine respectively. Chromatographic separation of DB213 and benzamidine was achieved on a SunFire C8 (4.6 × 250 mm, i.d. 5 μm) analytical column with gradient elution of a mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and 20 mM ammonium formate buffer (containing 0.5% formic acid). The method achieved good linearity from 1.95 ~ 1000 ng/ml (r2 = 0.999) in plasma and 0.98 ~ 125 ng/ml (r2 = 0.999) in brain. The validated method was successfully applied to plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) and brain uptake of intravenous administration of DB213 water solution (1 mg/kg) to Sprague-Dawley rats. It was found that the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 360 min (AUC0→360 min) was 184422.1 ± 42450.8 ng min/ml and the elimination half-life of DB213 after intravenous administration was 70.9 ± 16.1 min. In addition, DB213 has demonstrated a potential to cross the blood-brain barrier via intravenous administration with a brain tissue concentration of 11.3 ± 3.6 ng/g peaked at 30 min post-dosing. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Rapid economic development in China has produced serious ecological, environmental, and health problems. Neurotoxicity has been recognized as a major public health problem. The Chinese government, research institutes, and scientists conducted extensive studies concerning the source, characteristics, and mechanisms of neurotoxicants. Objectives: This paper presents, for the first time, a comprehensive history and review of major sources of neurotoxicants, national bodies/legislation engaged, and major neurotoxicology research in China. Methods: Peer-reviewed research and pollution studies by Chinese scientists from 1991 to 2015 were examined. PubMed, Web of Science and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were the major search tools. Results: The central problem is an increased exposure to neurotoxicants from air and water, food contamination, e-waste recycling, and manufacturing of household products. China formulated an institutional framework and standards system for management of major neurotoxicants. Basic and applied research was initiated, and international cooperation was achieved. The annual number of peer-reviewed neurotoxicology papers from Chinese authors increased almost 30-fold since 2001. Conclusions: Despite extensive efforts, neurotoxicity remains a significant public health problem. This provides great challenges and opportunities. We identified 10 significant areas that require major educational, environmental, governmental, and research efforts, as well as attention to public awareness. For example, there is a need to increase efforts to utilize new in vivo and in vitro models, determine the potential neurotoxicity and mechanisms involved in newly emerging pollutants, and examine the effects and mechanisms of mixtures. In the future, we anticipate working with scientists worldwide to accomplish these goals and eliminate, prevent and treat neurotoxicity. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

abstract={Benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) are emerging pollutants. Identification of microorganisms and the genes involved in the biodegradation of BACs is crucial for better understanding the fate of BACs in the environment and developing treatment strategies. Four microbial communities degrading BACs were developed from sewage (SEW), activated sludge (AS), soil (SOIL) and sea sediment (SEA) samples. According to 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and shotgun metagenome sequencing analyses, the most abundant species represented uncharacterized members of the Pseudomonas and Achromobacter genera. BAC biotransformation rates of the enriched microbial communities were 2.8, 3.2, 17.8, and 24.3 μM hr-1 for SEA, AS, SOIL, and SEW, respectively, and were positively correlated with the relative abundance of a particular Pseudomonas sp. strain, BIOMIG1. The strain BIOMIG1 mineralizes BACs at a rate up to 2.40 μmol hr-1 10-11 cells. Genomes of four BAC degrading and nondegrading BIOMIG1 phenotypes were sequenced and differentially compared with each other. As a result, a gene cluster encoding for transporters, an integrase and a dioxygenase were involved in BAC biotransformation. Our results suggest that BIOMIG1 plays a key role on the fate of BACs in the environment and genes, other than those reported to date, are involved in BAC biotransformation in various habitats. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={In this study, methacrylamide chitosan modified with perfluorocarbon chains (MACF) is used as the base material to construct hydrogel dressings for treating dermal wounds. MACF hydrogels saturated with oxygen (+O2) are examined for their ability to deliver and sustain oxygen, degrade in a biological environment, and promote wound healing in an animal model. The emerging technique of metabolomics is used to understand how MACF + O2 hydrogel dressings improve wound healing. Results indicate that MACF treatment facilitates oxygen transport rate that is two orders of magnitude greater than base MAC hydrogels. MACF hydrogel dressings are next tested in an in vivo splinted rat excisional wound healing model. Histological analysis reveals that MACF + O2 dressings improve re-epithelialization (p &lt; 0.0001) and synthesis of collagen over controls (p &lt; 0.01). Analysis of endogenous metabolites in the wounds using global metabolomics demonstrates that MACF + O2 dressings promotes a regenerative metabolic process directed toward hydroxyproline and collagen synthesis, with confirmation of metabolite levels within this pathway. The results of this study confirm that increased oxygen delivery through the application of MACF + O2 hydrogels enhances wound healing and metabolomics analyses provides a powerful tool to assess wound healing physiology. Statement of Significance This work presents the first application of a novel class of oxygen delivering biomaterials (methacrylamide chitosan modified with perfluorocarbon chains (MACF)) as a hydrogel wound dressing. This manuscript also contains strong focus on the biochemical benefits of MACF dressings on underlying mechanisms vital to successful wound healing. In this vein, this manuscript presents the application of applied metabolomics (tandem mass spectroscopy) to uncover biomaterial interactions with wound healing mechanisms. We believe the approaches described in this manuscript will be of great interest to biomedical scientists and particularly to researchers studying wound healing, metabolomics, applied biomaterials and regenerative medicine. © 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract={Following the phase-out of long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), the textile industry had to find alternatives for side-chain fluorinated polymer based durable water repellent (DWR) chemistries that incorporated long perfluoroalkyl side chains. This phase-out and subsequent substitution with alternatives has resulted in a market where both fluorinated and non-fluorinated DWRs are available. These DWR alternatives can be divided into four broad groups that reflect their basic chemistry: side-chain fluorinated polymers, silicones, hydrocarbons and other chemistries (includes dendrimer and inorganic nanoparticle chemistries). In this critical review, the alternative DWRs are assessed with regards to their structural properties and connected performance, loss and degradation processes resulting in diffuse environmental emissions, and hazard profiles for selected emitted substances. Our review shows that there are large differences in performance between the alternative DWRs, most importantly the lack of oil repellence of non-fluorinated alternatives. It also shows that for all alternatives, impurities and/or degradation products of the DWR chemistries are diffusively emitted to the environment. Our hazard ranking suggests that hydrocarbon based DWR is the most environmentally benign, followed by silicone and side-chain fluorinated polymer-based DWR chemistries. Industrial commitments to reduce the levels of impurities in silicone based and side-chain fluorinated polymer based DWR formulations will lower the actual risks. There is a lack of information on the hazards associated with DWRs, in particular for the dendrimer and inorganic nanoparticle chemistries, and these data gaps must be filled. Until environmentally safe alternatives, which provide the required performance, are available our recommendation is to choose DWR chemistry on a case-by-case basis, always weighing the benefits connected to increased performance against the risks to the environment and human health. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Phosphorylation is the enzymatic reaction of site-specific phosphate transfer from energy-rich donors to the side chains of serine, threonine, tyrosine, and histidine residues in proteins. In living cells, reversible phosphorylation underlies a universal mechanism of intracellular signal transduction. In this context, analysis of the phosphoproteome is a prerequisite to better understand the cellular regulatory networks. Conventionally, due to the low contents of signaling proteins, selective enrichment of proteolytic phosphopeptides by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) is performed prior to their LC-MS or -MS/MS analysis. Unfortunately, this technique still suffers from low selectivity and compromised analyte recoveries. To overcome these limitations, we propose IMAC systems comprising stationary phases based on collapsed Langmuir-Blodgett films of iron(III) stearate (FF) or iron(III) oxide nanoparticles (FO) and mobile phases relying on ammonia, piperidine and heptadecafluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Experiments with model phosphopeptides and phosphoprotein tryptic digests showed superior binding capacity, selectivity and recovery for both systems in comparison to the existing commercial analogs. As evidenced by LC-MS/MS analysis of the HeLa phosphoproteome, these features of the phases resulted in increased phosphoproteome coverage in comparison to the analogous commercially available phases, indicating that our IMAC protocol is a promising chromatographic tool for in-depth phosphoproteomic research. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Accordingly, this article systematically and critically reviews the epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFOA and PFOS and various immune-related health conditions in humans. Twenty-four epidemiologic studies have reported associations of PFOA and/or PFOS with immune-related health conditions, including ten studies of immune biomarker levels or gene expression patterns, ten studies of atopic or allergic disorders, five studies of infectious diseases, four studies of vaccine responses, and five studies of chronic inflammatory or autoimmune conditions (with several studies evaluating multiple endpoints). Asthma, the most commonly studied condition, was evaluated in seven studies. With few, often methodologically limited studies of any particular health condition, generally inconsistent results, and an inability to exclude confounding, bias, or chance as an explanation for observed associations, the available epidemiologic evidence is insufficient to reach a conclusion about a causal relationship between exposure to PFOA and PFOS and any immune-related health condition in humans. When interpreting such studies, an immunodeficiency should not be presumed to exist when there is no evidence of a clinical abnormality. Large, prospective studies with repeated exposure assessment in independent populations are needed to confirm some suggestive associations with certain endpoints. © 2016 Exponent, Inc.

abstract={Pharmaceuticals are known to occur widely in the environment of industrialized countries. In developing countries, more monitoring results have recently become available, but a concise picture of measured environmental concentrations (MECs) is still elusive. Through a comprehensive literature review of 1016 original publications and 150 review articles, the authors collected MECs for human and veterinary pharmaceutical substances reported worldwide in surface water, groundwater, tap/drinking water, manure, soil, and other environmental matrices in a comprehensive database. Due to the heterogeneity of the data sources, a simplified data quality assessment was conducted. The database reveals that pharmaceuticals or their transformation products have been detected in the environment of 71 countries covering all continents. These countries were then grouped into the 5 regions recognized by the United Nations (UN). In total, 631 different pharmaceutical substances were found at MECs above the detection limit of the respective analytical methods employed, revealing distinct regional patterns. Sixteen substances were detected in each of the 5 UN regions. For example, the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac has been detected in environmental matrices in 50 countries, and concentrations found in several locations exceeded predicted no-effect concentrations. Urban wastewater seems to be the dominant emission pathway for pharmaceuticals globally, although emissions from industrial production, hospitals, agriculture, and aquaculture are important locally. The authors conclude that pharmaceuticals are a global challenge calling for multistakeholder approaches to prevent, reduce, and manage their entry into and presence in the environment, such as those being discussed under the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management, a UN Environment Program. © 2015 SETAC © 2016 SETAC.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of 2 surgical techniques that are used to treat proximal femoral fractures. A systematic literature search (up to December 2014) was conducted in Medline, Embase, PubMed, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to screen for studies comparing proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) with less invasive stabilization system-distal femur (LISS-DF) for proximal femoral fractures. Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies and extracted data. Surgical information and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. A total of 7 studies with 361 patients who satisfied the eligibility criteria included 3 randomized controlled trials and 4 case-controlled trials associated with PFNA versus LISS in treating proximal femoral fractures. Our results demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in hospital stay and time to weight-bearing ambulation and bone healing for PFNA compared with LISS (odds ratio [OR]-1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]-2.92 to-0.05; OR-7.08, 95% CI-8.32 to-5.84; OR-2.71, 95% CI-4.76 to 0.67). No statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups for operative time, blood loss volume, Harris hip score, and incidence of complications. Based on the results of this analysis, we inferred that PFNA is safer and more effective than reverse LISS-DF in patients undergoing osteosynthesis for proximal femoral fractures, and that PFNA is associated with reduced hospital stays and reduced time to weight-bearing ambulation and bone healing. Nonetheless, in certain cases in which PFNA is not suitable due to abnormal structure of the proximal femur or particularly unstable fractures, the LISS plate technique could be a useful alternative. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In these organometallic species, the Fischer carbene complex is attached to the BODIPY moiety through a p-aminophenyl group linked at the C8 carbon atom of the BODIPY core. The photophysical properties, namely the corresponding UV/vis absorption and emission spectra of these new metal-carbene complexes, are analyzed and discussed. It is found that whereas the absorption of the considered dyads strongly resembles that of the parent 4-anilinyl-substituted BODIPY, the fluorescence emission is significantly reduced in these species, very likely as a result of a Förster-type energy transfer mechanism. At variance, the replacement of the pentacarbonyl-metal(0) fragment by a carbonyl group leads to high fluorescence emission intensity. In addition, the emissive properties of the BODIPY core in these organometallic dyads can be tuned by remote groups by means of π-conjugation, as supported by density functional theory calculations. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are widespread compounds, such as organohalogenated compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and pesticides, which can be found in all types of environmental compartments. Their presence in the aquatic environment is a worldwide problem, with emphasis on sediments which act as depository and consequently as a source of hydrophobic, recalcitrant and harmful compounds. Besides, these pollutants might affect the reproduction and mortality of living organisms, diverging in their potential to bioaccumulate in tissues. The present paper aims to review the occurrence of POPs in sediments and biota from the coastal, estuarine and river areas of Portugal. The list of the studied compounds comprises organohalogenated compounds, PAHs, organometallic compounds, pesticides, sterols, fatty acids and pharmaceutical compounds. The contamination of sediments by various pollutants is presented, such as PAHs up to 7,350 ng g−1 found in Sado estuary and polychlorinated biphenyls up to 62.2 ng g−1 in the case of sediments collected in Ria de Aveiro. The occurrence of these persistent toxic substances in sediments demonstrates aquatic contamination from agricultural, industrial and urban discharges and the concern about the potential risks to aquatic organisms, wildlife and humans. In fact, several classes of POPs have also been found in biota, such as polychlorinated biphenyls up to 810.9 ng g−1 in sentinel fish from the Douro River estuary and pesticides in bivalves from the Sado River estuary. The importance of further systematic research on sediments and biota is here highlighted to compare the contamination of these two reservoirs; to assess their spatial and temporal variation; and to determine other classes of POPs that were not investigated yet (e.g., industrial compounds, estrogens and many classes of pharmaceuticals). © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Study design Pregnant Sprague-Dawley dams were gavaged with 0, 5, and 20 mg/kg body weight PFOS daily from gestational day 12-18. On gestational day 18, pregnant dams were euthanized, placentas, and fetuses were collected. Main outcome measures Body weights of fetuses and placentas were measured, the corticosterone levels in fetal serum, and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 as well as the placental gene profiling were analyzed. Results 20 mg/kg PFOS significantly reduced fetal body weight and placental weight. Both 5 and 20 mg/kg PFOS increased fetal serum corticosterone levels. PFOS potently inhibited placental 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 activity. Of 21,910 genes, 45 genes were significantly downregulated ≥2 fold by 20 mg/kg PFOS, including extracellular matrix (Slpi and Pi16), growth factors and hormones (Trh and Pdf), ion transporters (Aqp1, S100a4, and Abp1), signal transducers (Kap and Ampd3), and structural constituents (A2m and Des).

abstract={Background and purpose: The diagnostic utility of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in patients with cryptogenic ischaemic stroke (IS) or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) remains controversial. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA guidelines to estimate the pooled prevalence of potential cardioembolic causes detected by TEE in prospective observational studies of cryptogenic IS/TIA. Cardiac conditions causally associated with cerebral ischaemia were considered to be intramural thrombi and intracardiac tumors according to ASCO phenotyping of IS. Results: Thirty-five eligible studies, comprising 5772 patients (mean age 53.6 years, 56.9% men) were identified. The most common TEE finding was ascending aorta and/or aortic arch atheroma [51.2% (27.4%-74.5%)], followed by patent foramen ovale (PFO) [43.2% (36.3%-50.4%)]. Complex aortic plaques and large PFOs were reported in 14% (10.2%-18.9%) and 19.5% (16.6%-22.8%) of TEE evaluations. The prevalence of atrial septal aneurysm was 12.3% (7.9%-18.7%) and was significantly higher in conjunction with PFO presence (risk ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.63-2.54, P &lt; 0.001). The prevalence of left atrial thrombus [3.0% (1.1%-8.3%)] and spontaneous echo contrast [3.8% (2.3%-6.2%)] was low. The prevalence of intracardiac tumors was extremely uncommon [0.2% (0%-0.7%)]. Significant heterogeneity was identified (I2 &gt; 60%) in the majority of analyses. Heterogeneity was not affected by cryptogenic stroke definition (TOAST versus alternative criteria). After dichotomizing available studies using a cut-off of 50 years, PFO was significantly (P = 0.001) more prevalent in younger than in older patients. Conclusion: Routine TEE in patients with cryptogenic IS/TIA commonly identifies abnormal findings. However, the prevalence of cardiac conditions considered to be causally associated with cerebral ischaemia (intracardiac thrombi and tumors) is low. © 2016 European Academy of Neurology.},

abstract={Background: Laparoscopic methods and fast-track surgery (FTS) can enhance recovery and reduce postoperative hospital stay. However, whether laparoscopic surgery can provide short-term benefits within FTS is controversial. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of published studies to evaluate the effect of laparoscopic colorectal surgery within FTS. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Ovid databases for eligible studies. Endpoints were duration of postoperative hospital stay, time to first bowel movement, total postoperative complication rate, readmission rate, mortality within 30 days after surgery, and conversation rate of laparoscopic surgery. Results: Four randomized controlled trials and six clinical controlled trials (1510 patients) were eligible for analyses. Duration of postoperative hospital stay (weighted mean difference, –1.65 days; p < 0.001), time to first bowel movement (–1.13 days; p < 0.001), total postoperative complication rate (risk ratio [RR], 0.65; p < 0.001), readmission rate (0.46; p < 0.001), and mortality (0.45; p < 0.001) were significantly reduced in the laparoscopic surgery group. Overall conversion rate of laparoscopic surgery was 11.1 %. Subgroup analyses based on each FT element demonstrated that studies without the element “prevention of hypothermia,” “no bowel preparation,” or “no routine use of drains” did not show significant differences between two groups with regard to duration of postoperative hospital stay or total prevalence of postoperative complications. Conclusion: Within FTS, laparoscopic methods can significantly shorten postoperative hospital stay, accelerate postoperative recovery, and enhance safety in colorectal surgery. The FT elements “prevention of hypothermia,” “no bowel preparation,” and “no routine use of drains” may play important parts in the combined effect of these two methods. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The 3.1 Mbp genomes of strain CF (that dechlorinates CF and 1,1,1-TCA) and strain DCA (that dechlorinates 1,1-DCA) each contain 17 putative reductive dehalogenase homologous (rdh) genes. These two genomes were systematically compared to three other available organohalide-respiring Dehalobacter genomes (Dehalobacter restrictus strain PER-K23, Dehalobacter sp. strain E1 and Dehalobacter sp. strain UNSWDHB), and to the genomes of Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 195 and Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain Y51. This analysis compared 42 different metabolic and physiological categories. The genomes of strains CF and DCA share 90% overall average nucleotide identity and > 99.8% identity over a 2.9 Mbp alignment that excludes large insertions, indicating that these genomes differentiated from a close common ancestor. This differentiation was likely driven by selection pressures around two orthologous reductive dehalogenase genes, cfrA and dcrA, that code for the enzymes that reduce CF or 1,1,1-TCA and 1,1-DCA. The many reductive dehalogenase genes found in the five Dehalobacter genomes cluster into two small conserved regions and were often associated with Crp/Fnr transcriptional regulators. Specialization is on-going on a strain-specific basis, as some strains but not others have lost essential genes in the Wood-Ljungdahl (strain E1) and corrinoid biosynthesis pathways (strains E1 and PER-K23). The gene encoding phosphoserine phosphatase, which catalyzes the last step of serine biosynthesis, is missing from all five Dehalobacter genomes, yet D. restrictus can grow without serine, suggesting an alternative or unrecognized biosynthesis route exists. In contrast to D. mccartyi, a complete heme biosynthesis pathway is present in the five Dehalobacter genomes. This pathway corresponds to a newly described alternative heme biosynthesis route first identified in Archaea. This analysis of organohalide-respiring Firmicutes and Chloroflexi reveals profound evolutionary differences despite very similar niche-specific metabolism and function. © 2016 Tang, Wang, Higgins, Löffler and Edwards.},

abstract={The pathogenesis of atherosclerotic inflammation is a multi-step process defined by the interweaving of excess modified lipid particles, monocyte-macrophages populations, and innate immune and adaptive immunity effectors. A part of innate immunity, the complement system, is an important player in the induction and progression of atherosclerosis. The accumulation of either oxidized or enzymatically modified LDL—bound to C-reactive protein or not—prompts complement activation leading to the assembly of the terminal complement C5b-9 complex in the atherosclerotic lesion. The sublytic C5b-9 assembly leads to the activation and proliferation of smooth muscle and endothelial cells, accompanied by the release of various chemotactic, pro-adhesion, and procoagulant cytokines from these cells. Response gene to complement (RGC)-32, an essential effector of the terminal complement complex C5b-9, also affects atherogenesis, propelling vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, stimulating endothelial proliferation, and promoting vascular lesion formation. A substantial amount of experimental work has suggested a role for the complement system activation during atherosclerotic plaque formation, with the proximal classical complement pathway seemingly having a protective effect and terminal complement contributing to accelerated atherogenesis. All these data suggest that complement plays an important role in atherogenesis. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

FASD groups included those with and without dysmorphy (i.e., FAS, pFAS, ARND, and other FASD diagnoses). Effect sizes (Hedges’ g, standardized mean difference) were calculated. Random effects meta-analytic models were performed using the metafor package for R. RESULTS: Fifty-one studies met inclusion criteria (FASD N = 2,115; ADHD N = 453; controls N = 1,990). Children with FASD showed the strongest and most consistent deficits in planning, fluency, and set-shifting compared to controls (Hedges’ g = -0.94, -0.78) and children with ADHD (Hedges’ g = -0.72, -0.32). FASD was associated with moderate to large impairments in working memory, compared to controls (Hedges’ g = -.84, -.58) and small impairments relative to groups with ADHD (Hedges’ g = -.26). Smaller and less consistent deficits were found on measures of inhibition and vigilance relative to controls (Hedges’ g = -0.52, -0.31); FASD and ADHD were not differentiated on these measures. Moderator analyses indicated executive dysfunction was associated with older age, dysmorphy, and larger group differences in IQ. Sex and diagnostic system were not consistently related to effect size. CONCLUSIONS: While FASD is associated with global executive impairments, executive function weaknesses are most consistent for measures of planning, fluency, and set-shifting. Neuropsychological measures assessing these executive function domains may improve differential diagnosis and treatment of FASD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract={We performed genome-wide meta-analysis of lipid traits on three samples of Mexican and Mexican American ancestry comprising 4,383 individuals, and followed up significant and highly suggestive associations in three additional Hispanic samples comprising 7,876 individuals. Genome-wide significant signals were observed in or near CELSR2, ZNF259/APOA5, KANK2/DOCK6 and NCAN/MAU2 for total cholesterol, LPL, ABCA1, ZNF259/APOA5, LIPC and CETP for HDL cholesterol, CELSR2, APOB and NCAN/MAU2 for LDL cholesterol, and GCKR, TRIB1, ZNF259/APOA5 and NCAN/MAU2 for triglycerides. Linkage disequilibrium and conditional analyses indicate that signals observed at ABCA1 and LIPC for HDL cholesterol and NCAN/MAU2 for triglycerides are independent of previously reported lead SNP associations. Analyses of lead SNPs from the European Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC) dataset in our Hispanic samples show remarkable concordance of direction of effects as well as strong correlation in effect sizes. A meta-analysis of the European GLGC and our Hispanic datasets identified five novel regions reaching genome-wide significance: two for total cholesterol (FN1 and SAMM50), two for HDL cholesterol (LOC100996634 and COPB1) and one for LDL cholesterol (LINC00324/CTC1/PFAS). The top meta-analysis signals were found to be enriched for SNPs associated with gene expression in a tissue-specific fashion, suggesting an enrichment of tissue-specific function in lipid-associated loci.},

Potential substances captured by the beads, after harvesting them, were eluted with a mixture of isopropyl alcohol, dichloromethane and ammonium hydroxide and the eluate subjected to GC-MS analysis in order to detect the presence, if any, of drugs, due to the fact that the writer suffered intense pains caused by an inherited nephrotic syndrome. Indeed all the pages under investigation (a total of ten, taken at random among 127 foils) contained traces of morphine, from as little as 5 up to 100ng/cm2. In addition to the intact drug, we could detect one of its metabolites, namely 6-O-acetyl morphine. The significance of these findings in terms of a possible improvement of the novel and in terms of drug use (or abuse) in the modern world is discussed and evaluated. Biological significance: The extraction of metabolites/proteins from the surface of the original manuscript pages of Bulgakov masterpiece Master i Margarita has permitted to monitor his health state and intake of medicaments over the last four years of his life. We have ascertained that: (1) he was assuming large doses of morphine as pain killers; (2) he was affected by a nephrotic syndrome, since we could identify three proteins known as biomarkers of this pathology. The double extraction procedure here reported could open up a novel field of investigation of (relatively) ancient manuscripts for metabolome/proteome analysis on the health status of the writer/artist. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: C5-C8 medium-chain carboxylic acids are valuable chemicals as the precursors of various chemicals and transport fuels. However, only a few strict anaerobes have been discovered to produce them and their production is limited to low concentrations because of product toxicity. Therefore, a bacterial strain capable of producing high-titer C5-C8 carboxylic acids was strategically isolated and characterized for production of medium chain length carboxylic acids. Results: Hexanoic acid-producing anaerobes were isolated from the inner surface of a cattle rumen sample. One of the isolates, displaying the highest hexanoic acid production, was identified as Megasphaera sp. MH according to 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Megasphaera sp. MH metabolizes fructose and produces various medium-chain carboxylic acids, including hexanoic acid, in low concentrations. The addition of acetate to the fructose medium as an electron acceptor increased hexanoic acid production as well as cell growth. Supplementation of propionate and butyrate into the medium also enhanced the production of C5-C8 medium-chain carboxylic acids. Megasphaera sp. MH produced 5.7 g L-1 of pentanoic acid (C5), 9.7 g L-1 of hexanoic acid (C6), 3.2 g L-1 of heptanoic acid (C7) and 1.2 g L-1 of octanoic acid (C8) in medium supplemented with C2-C6 carboxylic acids as the electron acceptors. This is the first report on the production of high-titer heptanoic acid and octanoic acid using a pure anaerobic culture. Conclusion: Megasphaera sp. MH metabolized fructose for the production of C2-C8 carbon-chain carboxylic acids using various electron acceptors and achieved a high-titer of 9.7 g L-1 and fast productivity of 0.41 g L-1 h-1 for hexanoic acid. However, further metabolic activities of Megaspahera sp. MH for C5-C8 carboxylic acids production must be deciphered and improved for industrially relevant production levels. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Combination of inorganic fillers into organic polymer membranes (organic-inorganic hybrid membranes) has drawn a significant deal of attention over the last few decades. This is because of the incorporated influence of the organic and inorganic phases towards proton conductivity and membrane stability, in addition to cost decline, improved water retention property, and also suppressing fuel crossover by increasing the transport pathway tortuousness. The preparation methods of the composite membranes and the intrinsic characteristics of the used particles as filler, such as size, type, surface acidity, shape, and their interactions with the polymer matrix can significantly affect the properties of the resultant matrix. The membranes currently used in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are perfluorinated polymers containing sulfonic acid, such as Nafion®. Although these membranes possess superior properties, such as high proton conductivity and acceptable chemical, mechanical, and thermal stability, they suffer from several disadvantages such as water management, CO poisoning, and fuel crossover. Organic-inorganic nanocomposite PEMs offer excellent potentials for overcoming these shortcomings in order to achieve improved FC performance. Various inorganic fillers for the fabrication of composite membranes have been comprehensively reviewed in the present article. Moreover, the properties of polymer composites containing different nanoparticles have been thoroughly discussed. © 2016 BRTeam.},

OBJECTIVE: To compare the difference in therapeutic efficacy between Inter Tan nail and PFNA for femoral intertro chanteric fractures using systematical review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A computer-based online search was conducted in Pub Med, The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2016), Embase, CNKI, VIP, CBM, and Wan-Fang databases up to May 8, 2016 to screen the relevant controlled trials of InterTan nail versus PFNA for the treatment of femoral intertrochanteric fractures. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted information, and assessed the quality of included trials. Data extraction from eligible studies was pooled and meta-analyzed using Stata13.1 software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 8 randomized and 8 non-randomized trials involving 1 323 patients were included. There were 658 patients undergoing InterTan nail and 665 patients undergoing PFNA. The meta-analysis results showed that there were no significant differences in excellent rate, intraoperative blood loss, bedridden time, and fracture healing time (P > 0.05). The operative time in InterTan nail group was longer than PFNA group [MD=11.51 , 95%CI(6.41_11.62), P < 0.01]. However, the InterTan nail was superior to PFNA in increasing the Harris scores [MD=1.38, 95%CI(0.25, 2.51), P=0.02], and decreasing the complication rates [RR=0.54, 95%CI(0.44, 0.67), P < 0.01]. Due to the limitations of the included studies, more high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to verify the above conclusion. In addition, future studies should focus on the difference in therapeutic efficacy of the two treatments in different fracture types and the osteoporosis patients. © 2016, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

abstract={BACKGROUND: More than 20 years ago, it was hypothesized that exposure to prenatal and early postnatal environmental xenobiotics with the potential to disrupt endogenous hormone signaling might be on the causal path to cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low sperm count and testicular cancer. Several consensus statements and narrative reviews in recent years have divided the scientific community and have elicited a call for systematic transparent reviews. We aimed to fill this gap in knowledge in the field of male reproductive disorders. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The aim of this study was to systematically synthesize published data on the risk of cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low sperm counts and testicular cancer following in utero or infant exposure to chemicals that have been included on the European Commission's list of Category 1 endocrine disrupting chemicals defined as having documented adverse effects due to endocrine disruption in at least one intact organism. SEARCH METHODS: A systematic literature search for original peer reviewed papers was performed in the databases PubMed and Embase to identify epidemiological studies reporting associations between the outcomes of interest and exposures documented by biochemical analyses of biospecimens including maternal blood or urine, placenta or fat tissue as well as amnion fluid, cord blood or breast milk; this was followed by meta-analysis of quantitative data. OUTCOMES: The literature search resulted in 1314 references among which we identified 33 papers(28 study populations) fulfilling the eligibility criteria. These provided 85 risk estimates of links between persistent organic pollutants and rapidly metabolized compounds (phthalates and Bisphenol A) and male reproductive disorders. The overall odds ratio (OR) across all exposures and outcomes was 1.11 (95% CI 0.91-1.35). When assessing four specific chemical subgroups with sufficient data for meta-analysis for all outcomes, we found that exposure to one of the four compounds, p,p'-DDE, was related to an elevated risk: OR 1.35 (95% CI 1.04-1.74). The data did not indicate that this increased risk was driven by any specific disorder. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The current epidemiological evidence is compatible with a small increased risk of male reproductive disorders following prenatal and postnatal exposure to some persistent environmental chemicals classified as endocrine disruptors but the evidence is limited. Future epidemiological studies may change the weight of the evidence in either direction. No evidence of distortion due to publication bias was found, but exposure-response relationships are not evident. There are insufficient data on rapidly metabolized endocrine disruptors and on specific exposure-outcome relations. A particular data gap is evident with respect to delayed effects on semen quality and testicular cancer. Although high quality epidemiological studies are still sparse, future systematic and transparent reviews may provide pieces of evidence contributing to the narrative and weight of the evidence assessments in the field. © The Author 2016.},

abstract={Activation of macrophages is critical in the acute phase of wound healing after implantation of surgical biomaterials. To understand the response of macrophages, they are often cultured in vitro on biomaterials. Since a wide range of biomaterials is currently used in the clinics, we undertook a systematic review of the macrophage polarization in response to these different surgical biomaterials in vitro. Beside the chemistry, material characteristics such as dimension, pore size, and surface topography are of great influence on the response of macrophages. The macrophage response also appears to depend on the differences in sterilization techniques that induce lasting biochemical changes or residues of chemicals and their byproducts used for sterilization. Regarding tissue-based biomaterials, macrophages on human or porcine dermis, strongly cross-linked by chemicals elicit in general a proinflammatory response with higher amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. Synthetic biomaterials such as polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) + polyacrylamide (PAAm), PET + sodium salt of poly(acrylic acid) (PAANa), perfluoropolyether (PFPE) with large posts, PEG-g-PA, and polydioxanone (PDO) always appear to elicit an anti-inflammatory response in macrophages, irrespective of origin of the macrophages, for example, buffy coats or full blood. In conclusion, in general in vitro models contribute to evaluate the foreign body reaction on surgical biomaterials. Although it is difficult to simulate complexity of host response elicited by biomaterials, after their surgical implantation, an in vitro model gives indications of the initial foreign body response and allows the comparison of this response between biomaterials. © Geesien S.A.

abstract={Proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) was theoretically designed to be an ideal intramedullary device for the fixation of intertrochanteric fractures by providing angular and rotational stability. We investigated when compared with Gamma nail (GN) and dynamic hip screw (DHS) whether PFNA was associated with (1) a lower incidence of reoperation, mortality and fixation failures, (2) a lower risk of major complications (wound infection and thromboembolism), (3) less operative blood loss, shorter surgical time, operative fluoroscopy time and hospital stay. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search in MEDLINE®, EMBASE, OVID and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and identified 753 papers. Of these, identified 13 randomized controlled trials comparing two (or more) common internal fixation devices (among PFNA, GN and DHS) in treatment of Intertrochanteric fractures. We performed both traditional direct-comparison meta-analysis and network meta-analysis. The strength of evidence was evaluated by using GRADE profiler software. Results: Direct-comparison meta-analysis demonstrated PFNA was associated with less operative blood loss when compared with GN (95% CI, -93.56 to -5.44, low confidence evidence) and DHS (95% CI, -291.90 to -151.58, low confidence evidence), and less operative fluoroscopy time when compared with GN (95% CI, -56.21 to -3.79, low confidence evidence). Network meta-analysis only found that PFNA was associated with less operative blood loss when compared with DHS (95% CI, -342.12 to -81.94) with very low confidence evidence. Conclusions: Current published evidence does not support the superiority of PFNA to other fixation strategies for intertrochanteric fractures. Although use of PFNA may be advantageous in reducing the operative blood loss and fluoroscopy time when compared with GN and DHS, the conclusion was limited and unacceptable because of the relatively low quality of evidences with either low or very low strength of confidence. © 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

abstract={Contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) include a wide variety of compounds like pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and their metabolites. In developing countries, CEC are gaining interest as they are contaminating the water resources. In Tunisia, for the first time, a total of 25 PPCPs and three of their metabolites were analysed in wastewater, reclaimed water, surface water and groundwater. Most of selected CEC were detected not only in raw wastewater, but also in treated wastewater and reclaimed water. High contents of Cl and Na in wastewater and reclaimed water were an indication of industrial discharge. PPCPs were detected in surface water from the Meliane River; the highest concentrations were measured close to the estuary to the Mediterranean Sea. High concentrations of 2-OH-ibuprofene in the Meliane River downstream a wastewater treatment plant might result from the biodegradation of ibuprofen during secondary wastewater treatment. Based on their levels of concentration, it is proposed to use carbamazepine, caffeine, ibuprofene, atenolol, fenofibric acid, methylparabene, bisphenol A, and 2-OH-ibuprofene as indicators of wastewater-derived pollution of surface water resources in Tunisia. Salinity of the groundwater in the study area is controlled by sea water entered decades ago due to over-pumping of groundwater. Groundwater quality is also influenced by CEC as sulfamethoxazol, carbamazepine, methylparabene, propylparabene, bisphenol A, trichlosan, and 1-H-benzotriazole were detected in groundwater collected from an area exposed to irrigation with reclaimed water. The presence of these compounds indicates that they are not completely removed during soil passage according to incomplete sorption and/or biodegradation. Thus, these compounds are suggested as indicators of wastewater contamination confirming the pollution of groundwater resources at sites where wastewater is reused for irrigation in agriculture. Special attention has to be paid to the occurrence of TRS occurring in groundwater since this compound is recognized to produce antibiotic resistance in the environment. Copyright © by PSP and PRT.},

abstract={Objective: This meta-analysis aims to analyze the usefulness of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) for posttreatment responses evaluation of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) management. Methods: Literature retrieval in three databases PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library was conducted up to September 2015, with pre-defined criteria. The technical success rate, local tumour recurrence and local tumour progression were the measurement indexes. Cochran's Q test and I2 were used for heterogeneity detection. Subgroup analyses were performed for complete ablation rate stratified by study designs, contrast agents and post-operative testing time points. Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata® 12.0 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX). Results: 12 studies consisting of 772 patients were included in this study. The CEUS-evaluated success rate of RFA for HCCs was 91%. The proportion of ablative margin &lt;5mm was 53%. The local tumour recurrence rate and local tumour progression rate were 4% and 8%, respectively. Subgroup analysis indicated that the CEUS-assessed technical success rate with Sonazoid™ (Daiichi-Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan) as the contrast agent was higher (95%) than those with other agents [SH U 508A (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) 86%; SonoVue (Bracco SpA, Milan, Italy) 87%]. The success rate assessed within 24 h (94%) after treatment was higher than longer time (1-3 days 86%; 1 month 91%). Conclusion: The meta-analysis showed that the CEU Sevaluated success rate of RFA for HCCs was 91%. The local tumour recurrence rate and local tumour progression rate were 4% and 8%, respectively. Advances in knowledge: Using meta-analysis, the study provided more reliable assessment of usefulness of CEUS, which could provide guidelines for HCC treatment. © 2016 The Authors.},

In particular, the review will focus on how these techniques have been successfully used to describe the salient characteristics of these catalysts that govern subsequent activity and selectivity, as well as to afford insight into deactivation phenomena that have seemingly stifled their application. We discuss how these X-ray-based techniques have been used to yield insight into the bulk structure, the catalyst surface, oxidation states, local (cobalt) geometry, and elemental composition of particles, primarily from a 1D perspective but we also highlight how, with recent developments in advanced X-ray characterisation methods, crucial information can now be obtained in 2D and 3D. The examples chosen focus on data acquired in situ/operando, under realistic operating conditions and during activation which often allow for obtaining a more relevant perspective on the changes in catalyst structure that accompany a change in catalyst performance. We conclude with a perspective on some of the challenges that beset the Co-based FTS technology and discuss how X-ray based techniques could be used to solve them. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Seventy-eight percent of cases consisted of extradural compressions from vertebral bone metastases, whereas there were only 5 cases of intradural extramedullary spinal cord compression. Most cases were managed with surgery and/or radiotherapy with a good clinical outcome in the majority. We report the first case of a pNET intradural extramedullary metastasis and conduct the largest review to date of an infrequent complication of well-differentiated NETs such as malignant spinal cord compression. Aggressive local treatment is warranted in most cases because it usually achieves neurologic improvement and symptomatic relief in patients who may still have a long life expectancy.

abstract={Introduction: Evaluation of the long-term performance of implants used in trauma surgery relies on post-marked clinical studies since no registry based implant assessment exists. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the evidence of performance of implants currently used for treating proximal femoral fractures (PFF) in Denmark.        Method: PubMed was searched for clinical studies on primary PFF with follow-up >= 12 months, reporting implant-related failure and evaluating one of following: DHS, CHS, HipLoc, Gamma3, IMHS, InterTan, PFN, PFNA or PTN. Limits: English language and publication date after 1st of January 1990.        Results: All studies were evidence level II or III. 30 publications for SHS were found: 13 of CHS, 15 of DHS and 2 of HipLoc. In total CHS was evaluated in 1110 patients (900 prospectively), DHS in 2486 (567 prospectively) and HipLoc in 251 (all prospectively). Fifty-four publications for nails were found: 13 of Gamma3, 7 of IMHS, 5 of InterTan, 10 of PFN, 24 of PFNA and 0 of PTN. In total Gamma3 was evaluated in 1088 patients (829 prospectively), IMHS in 1543 (210 prospectively), InterTan in 595 (585 prospectively), PFN in 716 (557 prospectively), PFNA in 1762 (1018 prospectively) and PTN in 0.        Conclusions: The clinical evidence behind the current implants used for proximal femoral fractures is weak considering the number of implants used worldwide. Sporadic evaluation is not sufficient to identify long term problems. A systematic post market surveillance of implants used for fracture treatment, preferable by a national register, is necessary in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) has been widely used in a variety of industrial and commercial applications as a surfactant and stain repellent. PFOS causes liver damage (including liver tumors) in experimental animals, primarily via interaction with PPARα and CAR/PXR. We investigated the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in PFOS-induced hepatotoxicity, and mechanisms involved in abnormal thyroid hormone (TH) homeostasis, in the livers of adult male rats exposed in feed to 50 mg PFOS/kg diet for 28 days. PFOS-treated rats exhibited expected histopathological and clinical chemistry changes, and global gene expression changes consistent with the involvement of PPARα and CAR/PXR. Thirty-eight miRNAs were significantly altered. Three members of the miR-200 family were the most increased, while miR-122-5p and miR-21-5p were the most decreased, in PFOS-treated rats. Expression of the miR-23b-3p/27b-3p/24-3p cluster also decreased in PFOS-treated animals. Pathway analysis of miRNAs and associated gene expression changes suggests involvement of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a primary process of tumor cell motility and cancer metastasis. Our analysis also revealed transcripts that may mediate PFOS-induced effects on TH homeostasis including: activation of the CAR/PXR pathway, phase II/III enzymes, and deiodinase. These changes are consistent with low serum TH due to enhanced metabolic clearance of TH. However, most TH hepatic target genes were not altered in a manner consistent with reduced TH signaling, suggesting that PFOS exposure did not induce functional hypothyroidism. Collectively, the study suggests an important role for miRNAs in PFOS-induced hepatotoxicity and provides insight into the effects of PFOS on TH homeostasis. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This work analyses the presence of forty-eight emerging pollutants, including twenty-five drugs of abuse and metabolites, seventeen cytostatic drugs and six iodinated contrast media, in tap water from the Madrid Region. Analysis of the target compounds in the tap water was performed by means of (on-line or off-line) solid-phase extraction followed by analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A preliminary human health risk characterization was undertaken for each individual compound and for different groups of compounds with a common mechanism of action found in tap water.        The results of the study showed the presence of eight out of the twenty-five drugs of abuse and metabolites analysed, namely, the cocainics cocaine and benzoylecgonine, the amphetamine-type stimulants ephedrine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and methamphetamine, the opioid methadone and its metabolite 2-ethylene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine and, finally caffeine at concentrations ranging from 0.11 to 502 ng L-1. Four out of the six analysed iodinated contrast media, namely, diatrizoate, iohexol, iomeprol and iopromide, were detected in at least one sample, with concentration values varying between 0.4 and 5 ng L-1. Cytostatic compounds were not detected in any sample. Caffeine was the substance showing the highest concentrations, up to 502 ng L-1, mainly in the drinking water sampling point located in Madrid city. Among the other drugs of abuse, the most abundant compounds were cocaine and benzoylecgonine, detected at concentrations ranging from 0.11 to 86 ng L-1 and from 0.11 to 53 ng L-1, respectively. Regarding iodinated contrast media, iohexol was the most ubiquitous and abundant compound, with a frequency of detection of 100% and concentrations from 0.5 to 5.0 ng L-1 in basically the same range in all sampling points.        Taking into account the results and types of treatment applied, ozonisation plus granular activated carbon filtration appears to be efficient in the removal of cocaine and benzoylecgonine. For the amphetamine-type stimulants, opioids and caffeine, ozonisation plus granular activated carbon filtration and ultrafiltration plus reverse osmosis showed higher removal efficiency than sand filtration.        The human health risk characterization performed indicates that the lifetime consumption of the tap waters analysed has associated a negligible human health concern. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The apetalous genotype is a morphological ideotype for increasing seed yield and should be of considerable agricultural use; however, only a few studies have focused on the genetic control of this trait in Brassica napus. In the present study, a recombinant inbred line, the AH population, containing 189 individuals was derived from a cross between an apetalous line ‘APL01’ and a normally petalled variety ‘Holly’. The Brassica 60 K Infinium BeadChip Array harboring 52,157 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers was used to genotype the AH individuals. A high-density genetic linkage map was constructed based on 2,755 bins involving 11,458 SNPs and 57 simple sequence repeats, and was used to identify loci associated with petalous degree (PDgr). The linkage map covered 2,027.53 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.72 cM. The AH map had good collinearity with the B. napus reference genome, indicating its high quality and accuracy. After phenotypic analyses across five different experiments, a total of 19 identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) distributed across chromosomes A3, A5, A6, A9 and C8 were obtained, and these QTLs were further integrated into nine consensus QTLs by a meta-analysis. Interestingly, the major QTL qPD.C8-2 was consistently detected in all five experiments, and qPD.A9-2 and qPD.C8-3 were stably expressed in four experiments. Comparative mapping between the AH map and the B. napus reference genome suggested that there were 328 genes underlying the confidence intervals of the three steady QTLs. Based on the Gene Ontology assignments of 52 genes to the regulation of floral development in published studies, 146 genes were considered as potential candidate genes for PDgr. The current study carried out a QTL analysis for PDgr using a high-density SNP map in B. napus, providing novel targets for improving seed yield. These results advanced our understanding of the genetic control of PDgr regulation in B. napus. © 2015 Wang, Yu, Li, Peng, Chen, Zhang, Chen, Hu and Zhang.},

abstract={A new sampling assembly consisting of a commercially available 5-L Niskin-X sampling bottle attached to a titanium frame vane was designed for uncontaminated sampling of trace metals in sea water at volumes of 5. L per depth. The assembly, called an X-Vane sampler, consists of a titanium and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polymer supporting frame, a "Π-style" secure bottle assembly and secure messenger assembly with titanium springs, a polycarbonate weather vane rear fin assembly, a commercially available modified 5-L Niskin-X bottle, a small temperature and depth (TD) logger, and a nylon and stainless steel wire clamp. The X-Vane sampler permits positioning the Niskin-X bottle at upstream of the hydrowire, away from any contamination. The Teflon-coated messenger strikes the "Π-style" assembly, which closes the Niskin-X, thereby obtaining a sea water sample for trace metal analysis at the desired depth. A second messenger held by the "Π-style" assembly is released downward along the hydrowire. In this manner, several bottles can be triggered sequentially in one operation. The Niskin-X bottles are stored and processed in a PVC clean sample drawing enclosure with a clean environment created by three class-100 air filter vents. The X-vane sampling system is easy to operate and is low in cost, compared to other clean sampling methods. In addition, it can be adapted to different types of research vessels with different hydrowire conditions. Analyses of contamination-prone trace metals (Fe, Al, and Mn) showed that samples obtained using the X-Vane sampler were uncontaminated, and the analysis results were in good agreement with those for samples obtained using a MITESS-Vane sampler. The X-Vane sampling device was demonstrated to be a reliable device for obtaining sea water samples for trace metal analysis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Pharmaceuticals as emerging pollutants have become a major concern not only because of the threat posed to health and safety of the aquatic life but also due to their continuous accumulation in aquatic environment and development of antibiotic-resistant microbial strains. Single classical water treatment techniques have been generally inadequate for the removal of these hazardous substances. Combined treatment techniques such as membrane separation and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is an exciting technology for complete removal of these pollutants because each technique complements the advantages and overcomes the challenges of the other. Technical flexibility of membrane separation technology has allowed possible integration/coupling with several AOPs as: pretreatment stage for removal of organics (which may cause membrane fouling) from membrane feed stream; post-treatment stage for oxidation of organics in both membrane permeate and concentrate streams or one pot/hybrid process for concurrent separation and oxidation of pollutants in the feed stream. AOPs such as ozonation, peroxone (O3/H2O2), UV/H2O2, photo-Fenton, photocatalysis and electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have been successfully integrated with membrane separation for removal of pharmaceuticals from water and they are critically examined in this review. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objective: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may influence concentrations of biomarkers of exposure and their etiologic significance in observational studies of associations between environmental contaminants and fetal growth. It is unknown whether the size of a developing fetus affects maternal GFR such that a small fetus leads to reduced plasma volume expansion (PVE), reduced GFR and subsequent higher concentrations of biomarkers in maternal serum. Our objective was to answer the question: "Is there an association between fetal growth and maternal GFR in humans?"Methods: We adapted and applied the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology to assess the evidence of an association between fetal growth and GFR, either directly or indirectly via reduction in PVE.Results: We identified 35 relevant studies. We rated 31 human and two non-human observational studies as "low" quality and two experimental non-human studies as "very low" quality. We rated all three evidence streams as "inadequate". The association between fetal growth and GFR was "not classifiable" according to pre-specified definitions.Conclusions: There is currently insufficient evidence to support the plausibility of a reverse causality hypothesis for associations between exposure to environmental chemicals during pregnancy and fetal growth. Further research would be needed to confirm or disprove this hypothesis. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.},

abstract={Untargeted metabolic profiling of body fluids in experimental animals and humans exposed to chemicals may reveal early signs of toxicity and indicate toxicity pathways. Avian embryos develop separately from their mothers, which gives unique possibilities to study effects of chemicals during embryo development with minimal confounding factors from the mother. In this study we explored blood plasma and allantoic fluid from chicken embryos as matrices for revealing metabolic changes caused by exposure to chemicals during embryonic development. Embryos were exposed via egg injection on day 7 to the environmental pollutant perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and effects on the metabolic profile on day 12 were compared with those caused by GW7647 and rosiglitazone, which are selective agonists to peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) and PPARγ, respectively. Analysis of the metabolite concentrations from allantoic fluid by Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) showed clear separation between the embryos exposed to GW7647, rosiglitazone, and vehicle control, respectively. In blood plasma only GW7647 caused a significant effect on the metabolic profile. PFOA induced embryo mortality and increased relative liver weight at the highest dose. Sublethal doses of PFOA did not significantly affect the metabolic profile in either matrix, although single metabolites appeared to be altered. Neonatal mortality by PFOA in the mouse has been suggested to be mediated via activation of PPARα. However, we found no similarity in the metabolite profile of chicken embryos exposed to PFOA with those of embryos exposed to PPAR agonists. This indicates that PFOA does not activate PPAR pathways in our model at concentrations in eggs and embryos well above those found in wild birds. The present study suggests that allantoic fluid and plasma from chicken embryos are useful and complementary matrices for exploring effects on the metabolic profile resulting from chemical exposure during embryonic development. © 2015 Mattsson et al.

abstract={BACKGROUND: Current approaches to chemical screening, prioritization, and assessment are being reenvisioned, driven by innovations in chemical safety testing, new chemical regulations, and demand for information on human and environmental impacts of chemicals. To conceptualize these changes through the lens of a prevalent disease, the Breast Cancer and Chemicals Policy project convened an interdisciplinary expert panel to investigate methods for identifying hemicals that may increase breast cancer risk. METHODS: Based on a review of current evidence, the panel identified key biological processes whose perturbation may alter breast cancer risk. We identified corresponding assays to develop the Hazard Identification Approach for Breast Carcinogens (HIA-BC), a method for detecting chemicals that may raise breast cancer risk. Finally, we conducted a literature-based pilot test of the HIA-BC. RESULTS: The HIA-BC identifies assays capable of detecting alterations to biological processes relevant to breast cancer, including cellular and molecular events, tissue changes, and factors that alter susceptibility. In the pilot test of the HIA-BC, chemicals associated with breast cancer all demonstrated genotoxic or endocrine activity, but not necessarily both. Significant data gaps persist. CONCLUSIONS: This approach could inform the development of toxicity testing that targets mechanisms relevant to breast cancer, providing a basis for identifying safer chemicals. The study identified important end points not currently evaluated by federal testing programs, including altered mammary gland development, Her2 activation, progesterone receptor activity, prolactin effects, and aspects of estrogen receptor (β activity. This approach could be extended to identify the biological processes and screening methods relevant for other common diseases. © 2015 Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

abstract={Aims: Insulin pumps are a vital and rapidly developing tool in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus in both adults and children. Many studies have highlighted outcomes and assessed their potential advantages, but much of the data on adverse outcomes are limited and often based on outdated technology. We aimed to review and summarize the available literature on insulin pump-associated adverse events in adults and children. Methods: A literature search was undertaken using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library. Articles were then screened by title, followed by abstract, and full text as needed. A by-hand search of reference lists in identified papers was also utilised. All searches were limited to English language material, but no time limits were used. Results: Current and past literature regarding insulin pump-associated adverse events is discussed, including potential metabolic and non-metabolic adverse events, in particular: pump malfunction; infusion set/site issues; and cutaneous problems. We show that even with modern technology, adverse events are common, occurring in over 40 % of users per year, with a minority, particularly in children, requiring hospital management. Hyperglycaemia and ketosis are now the most common consequences of adverse events and are usually associated with infusion set failure. This differs from older technology where infected infusion sites predominated. Conclusions: This timely review covers all potential insulin pump-associated adverse events, including their incidence, features, impacts, and contributory factors such as the pump user. The importance of ongoing anticipatory education and support for patients and families using this intensive insulin technology is highlighted, which if done well should improve the overall experience of pump therapy for users, and hopefully reduce the incidence and impact of severe adverse events. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Italia.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been associated with lower birth weight in epidemiologic studies. This association could be attributable to glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is related to PFAS concentration and birth weight. OBJECTIVES: We used a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of pregnancy to assess how much of the PFAS–birth weight association observed in epidemiologic studies might be attributable to GFR. METHODS: We modified a PBPK model to reflect the association of GFR with birth weight (estimated from three studies of GFR and birth weight) and used it to simulate PFAS concentrations in maternal and cord plasma. The model was run 250,000 times, with variation in parameters, to simulate a population. Simulated data were analyzed to evaluate the association between PFAS levels and birth weight due to GFR. We compared simulated estimates with those from a meta-analysis of epidemiologic data. RESULTS: The reduction in birth weight for each 1-ng/mL increase in simulated cord plasma for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was 2.72 g (95% CI: –3.40, –2.04), and for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was 7.13 g (95% CI: –8.46, –5.80); results based on maternal plasma at term were similar. Results were sensitive to variations in PFAS level distributions and the strength of the GFR–birth weight association. In comparison, our meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies suggested that each 1-ng/mL increase in prenatal PFOS and PFOA levels was associated with 5.00 g (95% CI: –21.66, –7.78) and 14.72 g (95% CI: –8.92, –1.09) reductions in birth weight, respectively. CONCLUSION: Results of our simulations suggest that a substantial proportion of the association between prenatal PFAS and birth weight may be attributable to confounding by GFR and that confounding by GFR may be more important in studies with sample collection later in pregnancy. © 2015 Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

abstract={In this paper, we present the preparation and characterization of Schottky barrier diodes based on silicon carbide with various Schottky metal layer thickness values. In this structure, molybdenum and aluminum were employed as the Schottky barrier metal and top electrode, respectively. Schottky metal layers were deposited with thicknesses ranging from 1000 to 3000 Å, and top electrodes were deposited with thickness as much as 3000 Å. The deposition of both metal layers was performed using the facing target sputtering (FTS) method, and the fabricated samples were annealed with the tubular furnace at 300 °C under argon ambient for 10 min. The Schottky barrier height, series resistance, and ideality factor was calculated from the forward I-V characteristic curve using the methods proposed by Cheung and Cheung, and by Norde. For as-deposited Schottky diodes, we observed an increase of the threshold voltage (VT) as the thickness of the Schottky metal layer increased. After the annealing, the Schottky barrier heights (SBHs) of the diodes, including Schottky metal layers of over 2000 Å, increased. In the case of the Schottky metal layer deposited to 1000 Å, the barrier heights decreased due to the annealing process. This may have been caused by the interfacial penetration phenomenon through the Schottky metal layer. For variations of VT, the SBH changed with a similar tendency. The ideality factor and series resistance showed no significant changes before or after annealing. This indicates that this annealing condition is appropriate for Mo SiC structures. Our results confirm that it is possible to control VT by adjusting the thickness of the Schottky metal layer. Copyright © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.},

abstract={In the present paper the application of on-line preparation techniques applied to LC-MS for the determination of emerging contaminants in environmental samples are critically reviewed highlighting the advantages but also the limits and the way to overcome them. Recent methods are collected in a detailed table and discussed in the text according to the different classes of compounds. The implementation of on-line SPE made possible the effective development of faster methods by reducing the analysis time and thus increasing the analytical productivity. The on-line SPE method are particularly suitable in studies where only limited sample material is available, as the sample volume can be as low as 1. mL. Most of the multiresidual methods have been developed using wettable and polar embedded reverse phases, sometimes sequentially packed with weak ionic exchangers in order to widen the polarity range of the adsorbents. On-line techniques have been also applied in cleanup of extracts of solid environmental samples, such as sediment, soil and biota, in order to minimize the ionization suppression effects from the matrix. Many applications employed RAM, often coupled to monolithic pre-concentration columns, but there is an increasing number of application of TFC for the determination of emerging pollutants in environmental samples. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Perfluorosulfonate ionomers have been shown to demonstrate a profound affinity for large cationic complexes, and the exchange of these ions may be used to provide insight regarding Nafion (R) morphology by contrasting molecular size with existing morphological models. The trimetallic complex, [{(bpy)(2)Ru(dpp)}(2)RhBr2](5+), is readily absorbed by ion-exchange into Na+-form Nafion((R)) membranes under ambient conditions. The dimensions of three different isomers of the trimetallic complex were found to be: 23.6 angstrom x 13.3 angstrom x 10.8 angstrom, 18.9 angstrom x 18.0 angstrom x 13.7 angstrom, and 23.1 angstrom x 12.0 angstrom x 11.4 angstrom, yielding an average molecular volume of 1.2 x 10(3) angstrom(3). At equilibrium, the partition coefficient for the ion-exchange of the trimetallic complex into Nafion (R) from a DMF solution was found to be 5.7 x 10(3). Furthermore, the total cationic charge of the exchanged trimetallic complexes was found to counterbalance 86 +/- 2% of the anionic SO3- sites in Nafion (R). The characteristic dimensions of morphological models for the ionic domains in Nafion (R) were found to be comparable to the molecular dimensions of the large mixed-metal complexes. Surprisingly, SAXS analysis indicated that the complexes absorbed into the ionic domains of Nafion (R) without significantly changing the ionomer morphology. Given the profound affinity for absorption of these large cationic molecules, a more open-channel model for the morphology of perfluorosulfonate ionomers is more reasonable, in agreement with recent experimental findings. In contrast to smaller monometallic complexes, the time dependent uptake of the large trimetallic cations was found to be biexponential. This behavior is attributed to a fast initial ion-exchange process on the surface of the membrane, accompanied by a slower transport-limited ion-exchange for exchange sites that are buried further in the ionomer matrix.},

abstract={High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a potentially fatal condition, occurring at altitudes greater than 3,000 m and affecting rapidly ascending, non-acclimatized healthy individuals. However, the lack of biomarkers for this disease still constitutes a bottleneck in the clinical diagnosis. Here, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-TOF mass spectrometry was applied to study plasma metabolite profiling from 57 HAPE and 57 control subjects. 14 differential plasma metabolites responsible for the discrimination between the two groups from discovery set (35 HAPE subjects and 35 healthy controls) were identified. Furthermore, 3 of the 14 metabolites (C8-ceramide, sphingosine and glutamine) were selected as candidate diagnostic biomarkers for HAPE using metabolic pathway impact analysis. The feasibility of using the combination of these three biomarkers for HAPE was evaluated, where the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.981 and 0.942 in the discovery set and the validation set (22 HAPE subjects and 22 healthy controls), respectively. Taken together, these results suggested that this composite plasma metabolite signature may be used in HAPE diagnosis, especially after further investigation and verification with larger samples.},

abstract={Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are used in fire-fighting foams but this is now being questioned because concerns are growing about their toxicity and impacts on the environment. Past use has resulted in their widespread accumulation in water sources, sediments and biota. They may pose risks to human health and the environment. Several technologies have been tested for removing PFOS and PFOA from water but most have only been developed at laboratory scale. This paper provides a critical review of existing methods for removing PFOS and PFOA from wastewaters with an emphasis on identifying processes that show promise for the development of practical industrial-scale remediation technologies. It is concluded that among the remediation technologies cited in the literature, removal by activated carbon has been the most widely used, with several successful field tests being reported. However, a number of limitations to the use of activated carbon exist, such as being ineffective at removing PFOA and other PFCs. Other adsorbents that have the potential to treat aqueous PFOS and PFOA include organo-clays, clay minerals and carbon nanotubes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose – Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and phosphorus are pollutants that can cause a wide array of negative environmental impacts. Phosphorus is a regulated pollutant in many industrial countries, while PPCPs are widely unregulated. Many technologies designed to remove phosphorus from wastewater can remove PPCPs, therefore the purpose of this paper is to explore the ability of these technologies to also reduce the emission of unregulated PPCPs. Design/methodology/approach – Through meta-analysis, the authors use the PPCPs’ risk quotient (RQ) to measure and compare the effectiveness of different wastewater treatment technologies. The RQ data are then applied via a case study that uses phosphorus effluent regulations to determine the ability of the recommended technologies to also mitigate PPCPs. Findings – The tertiary membrane bioreactor and nanofiltration processes recommended to remove phosphorus can reduce the median RQ from PPCPs by 71 and 81 percent, respectively. The ultrafiltration technology was estimated to reduce the median RQ from PPCPs by 28 percent with no cost in addition to the costs expected under the current phosphorus effluent regulations. RQ reduction is expected with a membrane bioreactor and the cost of upgrading to this technology was found to be $11.76 per capita/year. Practical implications – The authors discuss the management implications, including watershed management, alternative PPCPs reduction strategies, and water quality trading. Originality/value – The evaluation of the co-management of priority and emerging pollutants illuminates how the removal of regulated pollutants from wastewater could significantly reduce the emission of unregulated PPCPs. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

METHODS: We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs), clinical controlled trials (CCTs) or case-control studies on fast track surgery in elderly patients with colorectal cancer undergoing laparoscopic treatment from databases including Wanfang, CNKI, CBM, VIP, PubMed, EMBACE and Cochrane Library between January 1989 and March 2015. Metaanalysis was performed with RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: There were 5 RCTs and 2 CCTs involving 476 patients, including 244 patients in the FTS group and 232 in the control group. Compared with the control group, the time to passage of flatus [weighted mean of difference (WMD) = -36.46, 95%CI: -40.91--32.02, P < 0.0001], time to resumption of diet/drink (WMD = -43.90, 95%CI: -48.79--39.01, P < 0.0001), time to ambulation (WMD = -6.60, 95%CI: -7.71--5.49, P < 0.0001), and hospital stay (WMD = -4.53, 95%CI: -5.13--3.92, P < 0.0001) were significantly shorter, and the incidence of postoperative complications was significantly lower in the FTS group [odds ratio (OR) = 0.18, 95%CI: 0.11-0.31, P < 0.0001].

abstract={Gaseous microbubbles are being used in cardiovascular diagnostic procedures. They have further potential in diagnosis of tumours, vascular and blood flow abnormalities, as well as for targeted, ultrasound-triggered drug delivery and as intravascular mechanical devices. All the commercially available microbubble-based contrast agents comprise a fluorinated inner gas in their composition. Fluorinated components (fluorocarbon gases, self-assembling perfluoroalkylated surfactants) can play a key role in the engineering, investigation and development of microbubbles. Fluorocarbon gases provide osmotic stabilization and a co-surfactant contribution to interfacial tension reduction. Perfluoroalkylated surfactants self-assemble in aqueous media to form bubble shells with exceptional elasticity and resilience, and, optionally, effective anchorage for surface functionalization. This paper critically reviews the foremost methods used for preparing and monitoring microbubble suspensions. In particular, it identifies some common pitfalls encountered in the determination of microbubble sizes. The paper also reviews the methods used for collecting reliable data on the bubble morphology and shell structure that are required for understanding, controlling and improving their functional properties. Models for bubble shell studies include spontaneously adsorbed Gibbs films and spread Langmuir monolayers. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

The family of PBDEs consists of 209 isomers or congeners and their chemical structure, persistence and distribution in the environment follow similar patterns than the polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The main application of PBDEs is as flame retardants. They are added to electronics, appliances, textiles, furniture, carpets, construction materials and polymers. Globally, North America is the main consumer of the most toxic BDEs mix (penta-BDE) for humans and environment. The highest concentrations of PBDEs have been reported in the USA in wastewater and sewage sludge. In Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, similar concentrations of PBDEs to those of the USA were found in wastewater influents. There are no regulations for PBDEs monitoring, usage and disposal. However, some countries have eliminated and decreased the production and usage of this type of compounds. The aims of this paper were to review the most important aspects of these pollutants, to analyze the concentrations previously reported in wastewater and sewage sludge and to verify its environmental regulations in Mexico. © 2015, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM.

abstract={Structural elucidation of metabolites is an important part during the discovery and development process of new pharmaceutical drugs. Liquid Chromatography (LC) in combination with Mass Spectrometry (MS) is usually the technique of choice for structural identification but cannot always provide precise structural identification of the studied metabolite (e.g. site of hydroxylation and site of glucuronidation). In order to identify those metabolites, different approaches are used combined with MS data including nuclear magnetic resonance, hydrogen/deuterium exchange and chemical derivatization followed by LC-MS. Those techniques are often time-consuming and/or require extra sample pre-treatment. In this paper, a fast and easy to set up tool using desorption electrospray ionization-MS for metabolite identification is presented. In the developed method, analytes in solution are simply dried on a glass plate with printed Teflon spots and then a single drop of derivatization mixture is added. Once the spot is dried, the derivatized compound is analyzed. Six classic chemical derivatizations were adjusted to work as a one drop reaction and applied on a list of compounds with relevant functional groups. Subsequently, two successive reactions on a single spot of amoxicillin were tested and the methodology described was successfully applied on an in vitro incubated alprazolam metabolite. All reactions and analyses were performed within an hour and gave useful structural information by derivatizing functional groups, making the method a time-saving and efficient tool for metabolite identification if used in addition or in some cases as an alternative to common methods.

This systematic review aims to survey the related literature on the effects of environmental pollutants and especially organohalogens and phthalates on early puberty. Materials and Methods: A systematic review of papers published in the English language was completed in January 2014. Studies on the associations of organohalogens and phthalates with the puberty time were included. A literature search was conducted in EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from 1995 to January 2014; moreover manual search through references of relevant manuscripts was considered. The literature search identified 212 papers, of which 13 papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the current study. Two reviewers independently identified relevant papers for potential inclusion and assessed the methodological quality. Results: This review included 6572 participants in nine countries from three continents (Europe, North America, and Asia). Different studies determined the effects of pollutants on maturation signs and pubertal stages and confirmed the association of organohalogens and phthalates with early puberty. Conclusion: Based on the studied literature, environmental pollutants surround and accumulate in human societies and their adverse health effects are well documented. It can be concluded that organohalogens and phthalates are disturbing the normal process of puberty timing; especially their influence on early maturation in girls should be underscored. © 2015 Journal of Research in Medical Sciences.},

abstract={One of the important 'hallmarks' of cancer is angiogenesis, which is the process of formation of new blood vessels that are necessary for tumor expansion, invasion and metastasis. Under normal physiological conditions, angiogenesis is well balanced and controlled by endogenous proangiogenic factors and antiangiogenic factors. However, factors produced by cancer cells, cancer stem cells and other cell types in the tumor stroma can disrupt the balance so that the tumor microenvironment favors tumor angiogenesis. These factors include vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial tissue factor and other membrane bound receptors that mediate multiple intracellular signaling pathways that contribute to tumor angiogenesis. Though environmental exposures to certain chemicals have been found to initiate and promote tumor development, the role of these exposures (particularly to low doses of multiple substances), is largely unknown in relation to tumor angiogenesis. This review summarizes the evidence of the role of environmental chemical bioactivity and exposure in tumor angiogenesis and carcinogenesis. We identify a number of ubiquitous (prototypical) chemicals with disruptive potential that may warrant further investigation given their selectivity for high-throughput screening assay targets associated with proangiogenic pathways. We also consider the cross-hallmark relationships of a number of important angiogenic pathway targets with other cancer hallmarks and we make recommendations for future research. Understanding of the role of low-dose exposure of chemicals with disruptive potential could help us refine our approach to cancer risk assessment, and may ultimately aid in preventing cancer by reducing or eliminating exposures to synergistic mixtures of chemicals with carcinogenic potential. © The Author 2015.

abstract={Objectives To review the scientific and clinical literature to assess the basis for the use of biomaterials in stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Pelvic floor diseases (PFDS), such as SUI and POP, are common and vexing disorders. While synthetic mesh-based repairs have long been considered an option for PFD treatment, and their efficacy established in randomised clinical trials, safety of its use has recently been called into question. Materials and Methods Using the PubMed, MEDLINE and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) databases, we performed a critical review of English-language publications that contained the following keywords: 'pelvic organ prolapse', 'stress urinary incontinence', 'mesh', 'biomaterial', 'collagen', 'elastin' and 'extracellular matrix'. After reviewing for relevance for mesh use in the pelvis by two independent reviewers with a third available in the case of disagreement, a total of 60 articles were included in the present review. Results We found that many of the potential causes of PFDs are due to altered metabolism of patient extracellular matrix (specifically collagen, elastin, and their respective enzymes) and as such, repairs using native tissue may suffer from the same abnormalities leading to a subsequent lack of repair integrity. However, mesh use is not without its unique risks. Several publications have suggested that biomaterials may undergo alteration after implantation, but these findings have not been demonstrated in the normal milieu. Conclusion While the decision for the use of synthetic mesh is scientifically sound, its benefits and risks must be discussed with the patient in an informed decision-making process. © 2014 BJU International.},

We aimed to the explore associations of prenatal exposures to a large set of environmental chemical contaminants with asthma and eczema in school-age children. Methods We studied 1024 mother-child pairs from Greenland and Ukraine from the INUENDO birth cohort. Data were collected by means of an interview-based questionnaire when the children were 5-9 years of age. Questions from the ISAAC study were used to define asthma, eczema, and wheeze. We applied principal components analysis (PCA) to sixteen contaminants in maternal serum sampled during pregnancy, including perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), metabolites of diethylhexyl (DEHP) and diisononyl (DiNP) phthalates, PCB-153, and p,p'-DDE. Scores of five principal components (PCs) explaining 70% of the variance were included in multiple logistic regression models. Results In a meta-analysis that included both populations, the PC2 score, reflecting exposure to DiNP, was negatively associated with current eczema (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96). Other associations were not consistent between the two populations. In Ukrainian children, the PC3 score (DEHP) was positively associated with current wheeze (adjusted OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.03-2.37), whereas the PC5 score, dominated by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), was inversely associated with current wheeze (OR 0.64, 0.41-0.99). In Greenlandic children, a negative association of PC4 (organochlorines) with ever eczema (OR 0.78, 0.61-0.99) was found. Conclusions We found limited evidence to support a link between prenatal exposure to environmental chemical contaminants and childhood asthma and eczema. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In total, 201 chemical substances were targeted for analysis ranging from metals, organotin compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and associated metabolites, chlorinated paraffins, chlorinated and nonchlorinated organic pesticides, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), dechlorane plus, octachlorostyrene, brominated flame retardants (BFRs), organophosphorous compounds, brominated and alkyl phenols, cyclic siloxanes, and phthalates.

Polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides, organophosphorous compounds, and PFAS were the dominant contaminant classes of organic pollutants found within the seabird species, with the highest loads occurring in herring gulls, followed by shag, and common eider. New generation pollutants (e.g., PFAS, organophosphorous compounds, and alkylphenols) were detected at similar or higher concentrations than the legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Time trends of reported concentrations of legacy POPs appear to have decreased in recent decades from the Norwegian coastal environment. Concentrations of detected pollutants do not appear to have a negative effect on seabird population development within the sampling area. Additional stress caused by pollutants, however, may affect seabird health more at the individual level. © 2015 SETAC.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: The extramedullary fixation system including dynamic hip screw (DHS) is commonly used in treatment of Intertrochanteric fracture. However, in patients with unstable intertrochanteric fracture, extramedullary fixation system often leads to the failure of fracture fixation. Intramedullary fixation system including both proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) and InterTan nail has been widely used in the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures. OBJECTIVE: To compare the therapeutic effects of extramedullary fixation system containing DHS, PFNA and InterTan nail in the treatment of intertrochanteric fracture. METHODS: Literatures were searched in Wanfang, PubMed, Embase, Medline, the Cochrane library to screen literatures published from January 1990 to November 2014. Relevant studies addressing extramedullary fixation system containing DHS, PFNA and InterTan nail were screened.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: 346 articles were screened, and 13 of them were in accordance with the inclusion criteria. 1 271 patients with different types of intertrochanteric fracture were assessed in this study. Compared to DHS group, patients treated with PFNA and InterTan nail had shorter operation time and less blood loss. No significant difference in rehabilitation time and Harris score was detected among three kinds of fixation methods. Additionally, PFNA and InterTan nail had a similar effect. These findings verify that compared with DHS, PFNA and InterTan nail can optimize the surgery, but cannot elevate postoperative outcomes. © 2015, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

abstract={Introduction: Polytetrafluoroethylene is ubiquitous in materials commonly used in cooking and industrial applications. Overheated polytetrafluoroethylene can generate toxic fumes, inducing acute pulmonary edema in some cases. However, neither the etiology nor the radiological features of this condition have been determined. For clarification, we report an illustrative case, together with the first comprehensive literature review. Case presentation: A previously healthy 35-year-old Japanese man who developed severe dyspnea presented to our hospital. He had left a polytetrafluoroethylene-coated pan on a gas-burning stove for 10 hours while unconscious. Upon admission, he was in severe respiratory distress. A chest computed tomographic scan showed massive bilateral patchy consolidations with ground-glass opacities and peripheral area sparing. A diagnosis of polytetrafluoroethylene fume-induced pulmonary edema was made. He was treated with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and a neutrophil elastase inhibitor, which dramatically alleviated his symptoms and improved his oxygenation. He was discharged without sequelae on hospital day 11. A literature review was performed to survey all reported cases of polytetrafluoroethylene fume-induced pulmonary edema. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and OvidSP databases for reports posted between the inception of the databases and 30 September 2014, as well as several Japanese databases (Ichushi Web, J-STAGE, Medical Online, and CiNii). Two radiologists independently interpreted all chest computed tomographic images. Eighteen relevant cases (including the presently reported case) were found. Our search revealed that (1) systemic inflammatory response syndrome was frequently accompanied by pulmonary edema, and (2) common computed tomography findings were bilateral ground-glass opacities, patchy consolidation and peripheral area sparing. Pathophysiological and radiological features were consistent with the exudative phase of acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, the contrast between the lesion and the spared peripheral area was striking and was distinguishable from the common radiological features of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Conclusion: The essential etiology of polytetrafluoroethylene fume-induced pulmonary edema seems to be increased pulmonary vascular permeability caused by an inflammatory response to the toxic fumes. The radiological findings that distinguish polytetrafluoroethylene fume-induced pulmonary edema can be bilateral ground-glass opacity or a patchy consolidation with clear sparing of the peripheral area. © 2015 Hamaya et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={Anaerobic degradation of alkanes in hydrocarbon-rich environments has been documented and different degradation strategies proposed, of which the most encountered one is fumarate addition mechanism, generating alkylsuccinates as specific biomarkers. However, little is known about the mechanisms of anaerobic degradation of alkanes in oil reservoirs, due to low concentrations of signature metabolites and lack of mass spectral characteristics to allow identification. In this work, we used a multidisciplinary approach combining metabolite profiling and selective gene assays to establish the biodegradation mechanism of alkanes in oil reservoirs. A total of twelve production fluids from three different oil reservoirs were collected and treated with alkali; organic acids were extracted, derivatized with ethanol to form ethyl esters and determined using GC-MS analysis. Collectively, signature metabolite alkylsuccinates of parent compounds from C1 to C8 together with their (putative) downstream metabolites were detected from these samples. Additionally, metabolites indicative of the anaerobic degradation of mono- and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (2-benzylsuccinate, naphthoate, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-naphthoate) were also observed. The detection of alkylsuccinates and genes encoding for alkylsuccinate synthase shows that anaerobic degradation of alkanes via fumarate addition occurs in oil reservoirs. This work provides strong evidence on the in situ anaerobic biodegradation mechanisms of hydrocarbons by fumarate addition.},

Recent findings Recent studies have reported favorable outcomes in patients with VMT managed with observation, pharmacologic vitreolysis with ocriplasmin, and intravitreal perfluoropropane gas. Subgroup analysis has identified features associated with spontaneous release of VMT as well as features associated with successful pharmacologic release of VMT with ocriplasmin. Summary Observation may be an appropriate initial recommendation for patients with mild VMT. When treatment is necessary, pharmacologic vitreolysis with ocriplasmin is an effective nonsurgical therapeutic option. Careful patient selection improves success rates with ocriplasmin. Further study is necessary to establish the efficacy of intravitreal perfluoropropane gas for VMT as well as the efficacy of ocriplasmin in patients with VMT and concurrent retinal disease. As these treatments are more widely used, prospective data will continue to clarify their risk/benefit profile. Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Introduction. Inhalational exposure to metal-containing fumes generated by welding and related processes may result in the development of the clinical syndrome known as "metal fume fever." Polymer fume fever is a separate and distinct but related disorder that has been associated with inhalational exposure to specific fluorinated polymer products, such as polytetrafluoroethylene or Teflon®. We undertook a review of the peer-reviewed medical literature as it relates to these two disease entities in order to describe their epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and prognosis. Methodology. We performed a search of the PubMed (www.pubmed.com) and Ovid MEDLINE (ovidsp.tx.ovid.com) databases for keywords "metal fume fever," "polymer fume fever," and "fume fever," covering the period 1946 to September 2014, which resulted in a total of 141 citations. Limiting the search to articles published in the English language yielded 115 citations. These 115 articles were manually reviewed for relevance. In addition, the reference lists in each article retrieved were reviewed for additional relevant references. This left 48 relevant citations. Epidemiology. Metal fume fever occurs most commonly as an occupational disease in individuals who perform welding and other metal-joining activities for a living. It is estimated that 1,5002,500 cases of metal fume fever occur annually in the United States. Polymer fume fever was initially identified as an occupational disease but increased regulations have resulted in decreased incidence in the occupational setting. Overheating of Teflon®-coated cookware is one of the more common mechanisms for exposure. Pathophysiology. While the precise pathophysiology associated with the development of metal fume fever is yet to be elucidated, suggested pathophysiologic mechanisms include pro-inflammatory cytokine release, neutrophil activation, and oxygen radical formation. The pathophysiologic mechanism for polymer fume fever has not been definitively elucidated but may involve similar mechanisms to those proposed for metal fume fever. Clinical presentation. Metal fume fever typically presents with generally non-specific complaints including influenza-like symptoms, fever, shaking chills, arthalgias, myalgias, headache, and malaise. Onset of symptoms typically occurs 410 h following the exposure to metal-containing fumes. While metal fume fever is typically benign and self-limited, severe cases of the disease have been reported. In patients with ongoing metal fume exposure over the course of a workweek, tachyphylaxis occurs resulting in improvement in symptoms over the course of the workweek and maximal symptoms occurring after an exposure-free period such as a weekend. The clinical presentation of polymer fume fever is indistinguishable from metal fume fever, with an exposure history being necessary to distinguish the two entities. Diagnosis. Chest radiographs are typically normal in cases of metal fume fever and polymer fume fever; however, mild vascular congestion may be demonstrated and severe cases may feature diffuse patchy infiltrates. Laboratory studies are typically not necessary but may demonstrate leukocytosis with leftward shift or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Treatment. The primary treatment for both metal fume fever and polymer fume fever is supportive and directed at symptom relief. Oral hydration, rest, and the use of antipyretics and anti-inflammatory medications (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin) are recommended. A careful workplace exposure assessment analysis conducted by an occupational medicine specialist or clinical toxicologist in concert with a qualified industrial hygienist should be performed. Prevention. A careful workplace exposure assessment including measurement of ambient zinc and other metal (e.g., chrome, nickel, copper and manganese) fume concentrations or concentrations of fluorocarbon polymer decomposition products at different locations within the workplace should be performed. Prognosis. Metal fume fever is typically a benign and self-limited disease entity that resolves over 1248 h following cessation of exposure. Conclusions. Metal and polymer fume fevers generally follow a benign course with spontaneous resolution of symptoms, though both have the potential to be serious, especially in those with significant preexisting cardiorespiratory disease. © 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

abstract={Systems metabolic engineering has made the renewable production of industrial chemicals a feasible alternative to modern operations. One major example of a renewable process is the production of carboxylic acids, such as octanoic acid (C8), from Escherichia coli, engineered to express thioesterase enzymes. C8, however, is toxic to E. coli above a certain concentration, which limits the final titer. 13C metabolic flux analysis of E. coli was performed for both C8 stress and control conditions using NMR2Flux with isotopomer balancing. A mixture of labeled and unlabeled glucose was used as the sole carbon source for bacterial growth for 13C flux analysis. By comparing the metabolic flux maps of the control condition and C8 stress condition, pathways that were altered under the stress condition were identified. C8 stress was found to reduce carbon flux in several pathways: the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the CO2 production, and the pyruvate dehydrogenase pathway. Meanwhile, a few pathways became more active: the pyruvate oxidative pathway, and the extracellular acetate production. These results were statistically significant for three biological replicates between the control condition and C8 stress. As a working hypothesis, the following causes are proposed to be the main causes for growth inhibition and flux alteration for a cell under stress: membrane disruption, low activity of electron transport chain, and the activation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase regulator (PdhR). © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Methods Plasma and skeletal muscle metabolomic profiles were measured from lean and obese males before and after a 5-day HFD in the 4 h postprandial condition. Results At both time points, plasma short-chain acylcarnitine species (SCAC) were higher in the obese subjects, while the amino acids glycine, histidine, methionine, and citrulline were lower in skeletal muscle of obese subjects. Skeletal muscle medium-chain acylcarnitines (MCAC) C6, C8, C10:2, C10:1, C10, and C12:1 increased in obese subjects, but decreased in lean subjects, from pre- to post-HFD. Plasma content of C10:1 was also decreased in the lean but increased in the obese subjects from pre- to post-HFD. CD36 increased from pre- to post-HFD in obese but not lean subjects. Conclusions Lower skeletal muscle amino acid content and accumulation of plasma SCAC in obese subjects could reflect increased anaplerosis for TCA cycle intermediates, while accumulation of MCAC suggests limitations in β-oxidation. These measures may be important markers of or contributors to dysregulated metabolism observed in skeletal muscle of obese humans. © 2015 The Obesity Society.},

The results indicated that TAIC solution of 1000mg/L was effectively removed within 60min treatment at 120W output power. Six intermediates were identified and a possible evolution of the TAIC degradation process was continuously proposed basing on the results of mass spectrum analysis. The effects of metal ions and radical scavengers were investigated. Results showed that whatever hydrogen radical scavengers (carbon tetrachloride, perfluorooctane) or hydroxyl radical scavengers (iso-propyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol) all could further enhance the degradation processes, and both kings of radical scavengers could promote the generation of H2O2. In the present study, we employed a novel method by introducing the mixed additives of Fe2+ and radical scavengers into the plasma. It was found that the reaction rate constant and energy efficiency were improved by 309.2% and 387.8%, respectively. Among the mixed additives, Fe2+ could promote the decomposition and increase the oxidizing power of H2O2, which is generated from the plasma discharge and greatly enhanced by the radical scavengers. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Introduction and hypothesis: The discovery of tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) began in 1986 with two unrelated observations: pressure applied unilaterally at the midurethra controlled urine loss on coughing; implanted Teflon tape caused a collagenous tissue reaction. Methods and results: In 1987, Mersilene tape was implanted retropubically in 13 large dogs, with the aim of creating an artificial collagenous pubourethral neoligament. Extensive testing showed that the operation was safe and effective. In 1988–1989, human testing was carried out (n = 30). Mersilene tape cured 100 % of stress and mixed incontinence with a sling in situ; however, there was simultaneous recurrence of the two symptoms in 50 % on sling removal. X-rays showed no elevation of the bladder neck. In 1990–1993, collaboration with Ulf Ulmsten took place: a permanently implanted tape was required. Polypropylene was the ideal material. In 2003, the neoligament principle was applied as an adjustable “micro” sling to the arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis (ATFP), cardinal, uterosacral ligaments, and perineal body for cure of cystocele, rectocele, and apical prolapse. It was found that symptoms such as urgency, nocturia, chronic pelvic pain, obstructive defecation syndrome (ODS), and fecal incontinence were frequently cured or improved. Conclusions: The lecture concluded with advice to younger members. Without new paradigms, there are no randomized controlled trials, no meta-analyses, Cochrane. Indeed, no progress. Be open to new concepts. Read Kuhn’s “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions” to understand the discovery process. Examine the relationship among symptoms, ATFP, cardinal, uterosacral ligaments, and the perineal body. This is the next paradigm. Don’t disregard anomalies. Pursue them. They are the pathway to discovery. Innovation is born from challenge, not conformity. Persist, even when meeting resistance. Resistance is a sign that your discovery is important. © 2015, The International Urogynecological Association.},

Methodological quality of the trials was critically assessed, and relevant data were extracted. Statistical software RevMan 5.0 was used for data-analysis.RESULTS: Seven articles were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that,compared internal fixation with hip replacement,there were statistical significance in the duration of surgery time [WMD = -2.66, 95% CI (-5.25,-0.06), P = 0.05], intra-operative blood loss [WMD = -24.20, 95% CI (-30.38, -18.02), P < 0.000 01], hospital stays time [WMD = -4.72, 95% CI (-5.18, -4.25), P < 0.000 01], bearing load time [WMD = -29.54, 95% CI (-30.77, -28.31), P < 0.000 01], total complications rate [WMD = 0.15, 95% CI (0.11, 0.22), P < 0.000 01], the good rate of Harris scores [WMD = 1.09, 95% CI (0.54,1.32), P < 0.05]. However, there were no statistical significance in the rate of deep venous thrombosis [WMD = 1.09, 95% CI (0.47, 2.55), P > 0.05]. CON- CLUSION: Hip replacement (containing FHR or THA) for the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures is superior to internal fixa- tion in regards to the duration of surgery time, the mean duration of hosipital stays, mean post-operative down time, intra-opera- tive blood loss, the rate of post-operative good Harris scores. But there is not enough evidence to show any difference between hip replacement (containing THA or FHR) and internal fixation in regards to the rate of deep venous thrombosis. However, internal fixation for the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures is superior to hip replacement (containing FHR or THA) in regards to total complications rate.},

abstract={Patent foramen ovale (PFO) has been linked to stroke, presumably through the mechanism of paradoxical embolism; however, data is confusing regarding the causal relationship between PFO and embolic stroke. What has come to light in the past decade of research is that PFO closure with devices that achieve a high rate of closure may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke compared with medical therapy, but this benefit has not been shown in the general population with a PFO and cryptogenic stroke. The important question now is which patient will benefit from PFO closure for stroke risk reduction. A validated risk prediction tool is needed to help physicians determine those patients who will derive benefit from closure of PFO to prevent recurrent stroke. It is clear that even in studies with a small number of individuals and a very small number of events, there is some benefit to closure. Furthermore, improvements in closure devices and techniques have made percutaneous device closure both safe and efficacious. As such, it is not necessary to wait for a patient to have two strokes prior to serious consideration of PFO closure. We would advocate that the decision to close a PFO in the setting of a cryptogenic stroke be made at an individual level, on a case-by-case basis. Patients with high-risk features may be more likely to benefit, though who exactly comprises this population is still being elucidated. The most difficult aspect of managing this disease is the substantial number of individuals with incidental PFOs, as well as the prevalence of stroke due to other etiologies. When treating this disease, the physician must be able to weigh the likelihood of benefit versus the risk of the procedure, as well as patient preference. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Transition-metal-mediated fluoroalkylation is a hot research topic in current organofluorine chemistry. In the past five years, due to the development of new perfluoroalkylation reagents and methodologies, significant progress has been made in the field of transition-metal-mediated perfluoroalkylation. Compared with perfluoroalkylation, di- and monofluoroalkylation can not only introduce fluorine atom(s) into a molecule, but also install a non-fluorinated moiety simultaneously; therefore, in organic synthesis, these reactions are of higher step economy than the direct fluorination reactions. Although analogous to transition-metal-mediated perfluoroalkylations, the di- and monofluoroalkylation have been relatively less developed; therefore, there are still many opportunities for their development. In this review, we have made a survey on transition- metal-mediated di- and monofluoroalkylation reactions that were published in the past nearly 30 years. To our knowledge, this is the first rather comprehensive review on this topic. This review is divided into five sections. The first section is the general introduction on di- and monofluoroalkylation. The second and third sections focus on the historical development of transition-metal-mediated di- and monofluoroalkylation with reagents that contain functional groups. These two sections are subdivided according to the reactions types, that is, fluoroalkylation of unsaturated organohalides, fluoroalkylation of the carbon-hydrogen bonds of unsaturated systems (arenes, alkenes, alkynes, and carbonyl compounds), fluoroalkylation of organoborane reagents and organometallic reagents, fluoroalkyl addition to unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds. The fourth section puts an emphasis on the transition-metal-promoted di- and monofluoromethylation reactions. The final section gives some perspectives on the future development of this chemistry. © 2015 Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences},

With rs156429 in GPNMB, there was a significant difference in genotype and allele distribution between male PD patients and the control subgroup (genotype p=. 0.01, allele p=. 0.01, OR. =. 0.67, 95% CI. =. 0.49-0.92). However, we did not observe any significant difference in genotype or allele distribution between PD and control for rs34016896 in NMD3 and rs6812193 in STBD1. © 2014.},

abstract={Background: Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) may result in negative energy balance and weight loss through increased energy expenditure and lipid oxidation. However, results from human intervention studies investigating the weight reducing potential of MCTs, have been mixed. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of MCTs, specifically C8:0 and C10:0, to long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) on weight loss and body composition in adults. Changes in blood lipid levels were secondary outcomes. Methods: Randomized controlled trials &gt;3 weeks' duration conducted in healthy adults were identified searching Web of Knowledge, Discover, PubMed, Scopus, New Zealand Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL until March 2014 with no language restriction. Identified trials were assessed for bias. Mean differences were pooled and analyzed using inverse variance models with fixed effects. Heterogeneity between studies was calculated using I2 statistic. An I2&gt;50% or P&lt;0.10 indicated heterogeneity. Results: Thirteen trials (n=749) were identified. Compared with LCTs, MCTs decreased body weight (-0.51 kg [95% CI-0.80 to -0.23 kg]; P&lt;0.001; I2=35%); waist circumference (-1.46 cm [95% CI -2.04 to -0.87 cm]; P&lt;0.001; I2=0%), hip circumference (-0.79 cm [95% CI -1.27 to -0.30 cm]; P=0.002; I2=0%), total body fat (standard mean difference -0.39 [95% CI -0.57 to -0.22]; P&lt;0.001; I2=0%), total subcutaneous fat (standard mean difference -0.46 [95% CI -0.64 to -0.27]; P&lt;0.001; I2=20%), and visceral fat (standard mean difference -0.55 [95% CI -0.75 to -0.34]; P&lt;0.001; I2=0%). No differences were seen in blood lipid levels. Many trials lacked sufficient information for a complete quality assessment, and commercial bias was detected. Although heterogeneity was absent, study designs varied with regard to duration, dose, and control of energy intake. Conclusions: Replacement of LCTs with MCTs in the diet could potentially induce modest reductions in body weight and composition without adversely affecting lipid profiles. However, further research is required by independent research groups using large, well-designed studies to confirm the efficacy of MCT and to determine the dosage needed for the management of a healthy body weight and composition. © 2015 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.},

abstract={Background: There is a growing concern in Sweden and elsewhere that continued emissions of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may cause environmental as well as human health effects. PFASs are a broad class of man-made substances that have been produced and used in both commercial products and industrial processes for more than 60 years. Although the production and use of some PFASs has been phased-out in some parts of the world, it is not known what effect these actions to date have had on PFAS concentrations in the environment. Owing to the wide diversity of PFASs, it is difficult to generalize their properties, environmental fate and production histories. However, the strength and stability of the C-F bond renders the perfluoroalkyl moieties resistant to heat and environmental degradation. Several PFASs are now occurring even in very remote areas in large parts of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of substances within this group is not well understood. A systematic review may be able to determine whether the concentrations of these substances in different environments are changing in any particular direction with time, and whether the phase-outs have had any effects on the concentration trends. Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations in the environment will be performed in the scientific literature as well as in other reports. Relevant samples include both abiotic and biological samples including humans. No particular time, document type, language or geographical constraints will be applied. Two authors will screen all retrieved articles. Double screening of about 10% of the articles will be performed by all authors at both title/abstract and full-text levels. Kappa tests will be used to test if the screening is consistent. Relevant articles will be critically appraised by four authors (double checking of 25% of the articles). Quality assessment will focus on selection bias, dating of samples, sample integrity and analytical procedures. Data synthesis will be based on statistical analysis of temporal concentration trends. © 2015 Land et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={Blood plasma is a well-known body fluid often analyzed in studies on the effects of toxic compounds as physiological or chemical induced changes in the mammalian body are reflected in the plasma metabolome. Sample preparation prior to LC-MS based analysis of the plasma metabolome is a challenge as plasma contains compounds with very different properties. Besides, proteins, which usually are precipitated with organic solvent, phospholipids, are known to cause ion suppression in electrospray mass spectrometry.We have compared two different sample preparation techniques prior to LC-qTOF analysis of plasma samples: the first is protein precipitation; the second is protein precipitation followed by solid phase extraction with sub-fractionation into three sub-samples: a phospholipid, a lipid and a polar sub-fraction. Molecular feature extraction of the data files from LC-qTOF analysis of the samples revealed 1792 molecular features from the protein precipitation procedure. The protein precipitation followed by solid phase extraction procedure with three sub-samples gave a total of 4234 molecular features. This suggests that sub-sampling into polar, lipid and phospholipid fractions enables extraction of more metabolomic information as compared to protein precipitation alone. Chromatography showed good separation of the metabolites with little retention time drift (<1. s) and a mass accuracy below 3. ppm was observed. The performance of the method was investigated using plasma samples from rats administered the environmental pollutant perfluorononanoic acid. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={SOLUTIONS (2013 to 2018) is a European Union Seventh Framework Programme Project (EU-FP7). The project aims to deliver a conceptual framework to support the evidence-based development of environmental policies with regard to water quality. SOLUTIONS will develop the tools for the identification, prioritisation and assessment of those water contaminants that may pose a risk to ecosystems and human health. To this end, a new generation of chemical and effect-based monitoring tools is developed and integrated with a full set of exposure, effect and risk assessment models. SOLUTIONS attempts to address legacy, present and future contamination by integrating monitoring and modelling based approaches with scenarios on future developments in society, economy and technology and thus in contamination. The project follows a solutions-oriented approach by addressing major problems of water and chemicals management and by assessing abatement options. SOLUTIONS takes advantage of the access to the infrastructure necessary to investigate the large basins of the Danube and Rhine as well as relevant Mediterranean basins as case studies, and puts major efforts on stakeholder dialogue and support. Particularly, the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) Common Implementation Strategy (CIS) working groups, International River Commissions, and water works associations are directly supported with consistent guidance for the early detection, identification, prioritisation, and abatement of chemicals in the water cycle. SOLUTIONS will give a specific emphasis on concepts and tools for the impact and risk assessment of complex mixtures of emerging pollutants, their metabolites and transformation products. Analytical and effect-based screening tools will be applied together with ecological assessment tools for the identification of toxicants and their impacts. The SOLUTIONS approach is expected to provide transparent and evidence-based candidates or River Basin Specific Pollutants in the case study basins and to assist future review of priority pollutants under the WFD as well as potential abatement options. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Systematic review methodologies were first developed to assess the efficacy of health care interventions, but these approaches can be adapted to evaluations of environmental health questions such as immunotoxicity associated with PFOA and PFOS exposure. This structured approach provides objectivity and transparency to the process of collecting, synthesizing, and reaching conclusions based on the scientific evidence available. Objectives: To outline the process of systematic review and evidence integration and demonstrate each step by following a single research question from start to finish. The example systematic review will evaluate the evidence that PFOA and PFOS exposure are associated with immunotoxicity – using a subset of the available evidence to illustrate concepts, not to develop hazard identification conclusions. Methods: The Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Approach to evaluating the scientific evidence for immunotoxicity of PFOA and PFOS is detailed in a protocol that is laid out in seven steps: scoping and problem formulation, search for and select studies for inclusion, extract data from studies, assess quality of individual studies, rate confidence in the body of evidence, translate confidence ratings into level of evidence, and integrate evidence to develop hazard identification conclusions incorporating human, animal, and mechanistic evidence. Results and Discussion: Eligibility criteria for identifying important exposures and outcomes were presented as the basis for assembling the relevant studies for evaluating whether or not PFOA or PFOS exposure is associated with immunotoxicity (human, n = 18; animal, n = 80; and mechanistic/in vitro assays, n = 19). A tool for assessing study quality in terms of risk of bias or internal validity was tailored to the research question – particularly for evaluating PFC exposure and assessing immunological outcomes. An example of an evidence profile is provided to illustrate the basis for confidence ratings using a hypothetical set of studies of PFOS and functional antibody response. Finally, a discussion is presented on how the hazard identification conclusions would be reached and interpreted by integrating the human, animal, and mechanistic evidence. Conclusion: The OHAT Approach to hazard identification of health effects of PFCs is illustrated with a case study on PFOA/PFOS and immunotoxicity. Communication of the evaluation process is enhanced by using objective, reproducible methods that transparently document scientific judgments and the scientific basis for hazard identification conclusions. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

Methods: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1 January 1995 and 21 June 2013 comparing FTS with conventional perioperative care for patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy were identified in the PubMed, Embase™ and Cochrane Library databases, and were analysed systematically using RevMan software (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Results: Seven RCTs (524 patients) were analysed. Compared with conventional perioperative care, FTS treatment with/without laparoscopy was associated with shorter postoperative hospitalisation, less hospitalisation expenditure (both p<0.00001), less pain and better quality of life. Short-term morbidity and readmission rates did not differ between treatments. No incidents of death occurred during the short-term follow-up period. Conclusions: In patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy, the FTS pathway reduces the length and cost of postoperative hospitalisation while maintaining short-term morbidity, readmission and mortality rates comparable with those of conventional care.},

abstract={Background: The Inter-Agency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crises conducted a ten-year global evaluation of reproductive health in humanitarian settings. This paper examines proposals for reproductive health activities under humanitarian health and protection funding mechanisms for 2002-2013, and the level at which these reproductive health proposals were funded. Methods: The study used English and French health and protection proposal data for 2002-2013, extracted from the Financial Tracking Service (FTS) database managed by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Every project was reviewed for relevance against pre-determined reproductive health definitions for 2002-2008. An in-depth analysis was additionally conducted for 2009-2013 through systematically reviewing proposals via a key word search and subsequently classifying them under designated reproductive health categories. Among the relevant reproductive health proposals, counts and proportions were calculated in Excel based on their reproductive health components, primarily by year. Contributions, requests, and unfunded requests were calculated based on the data provided by FTS. Results: Among the 11,347 health and protection proposals issued from 345 emergencies between 2002 and 2013, 3,912 were relevant to reproductive health (34.5%). The number of proposals containing reproductive health activities increased by an average of 21.9% per year, while the proportion of health and protection sector appeals containing reproductive health activities increased by an average of 10.1% per year. The total funding request over the 12 years amounted to $4.720 billion USD, of which $2.031 billion USD was received. Among reproductive health components for 2009-2013 proposals, maternal newborn health comprised the largest proportion (56.4%), followed by reproductive health-related gender-based violence (45.9%), HIV/sexually transmitted infections (37.5%), general reproductive health (26.2%), and lastly, family planning (14.9%). Conclusion: Findings show that more agencies are responding to humanitarian appeals by proposing to implement reproductive health programs and receiving increased aid over the twelve year period. While such developments are welcome, project descriptions show comparatively limited attention and programming for family planning and abortion care in particular. © 2015 Tanabe et al.},

abstract={Current evidence supports the notion that environmental exposures are associated with DNA-methylation and expression changes that can impact human health. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of epidemiologic studies evaluating the association between environmental chemicals with DNA methylation levels in adults. After excluding arsenic, recently evaluated in a systematic review, we identified a total of 17 articles (6 on cadmium, 4 on lead, 2 on mercury, 1 on nickel, 1 on antimony, 1 on tungsten, 5 on persistent organic pollutants and perfluorinated compounds, 1 on bisphenol A, and 3 on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). The selected articles reported quantitative methods to determine DNA methylation including immunocolorimetric assays for total content of genomic DNA methylation, and microarray technologies, methylation-specific quantitative PCR, Luminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA), and bisulfite pyrosequencing for DNA methylation content of genomic sites such as gene promoters, LINE-1, Alu elements, and others. Considering consistency, temporality, strength, dose-response relationship, and biological plausibility, we concluded that the current evidence is not sufficient to provide inference because differences across studies and limited samples sizes make it difficult to compare across studies and to evaluate sources of heterogeneity. Important questions for future research include the need for larger and longitudinal studies, the validation of findings, and the systematic evaluation of the dose-response relationships. Future studies should also consider the evaluation of epigenetic marks recently in the research spotlight such as DNA hydroxymethylation and the role of underlying genetic variants. © 2015 Ruiz-Hernandez et al.},

abstract={Speciation analysis of selenium metabolites in urine was performed using hyphenation of mixed ion-pair reversed-phase chromatography and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. A chromatographic separation was performed with a C8 stationary phase and a mobile phase containing 2.5 mmol L-1 sodium butane-1-sulfonate, 8 mmol L-1 tetramethylammonium hydroxide, 4 mmol L-1 malonic acid, and 0.05% methanol, pH 3.0. Under this condition, the selenium species selenite, selenate, selenomethionine, selenoethionine, selenourea, trimethylselenonium, and Se-methylselenocysteine were successfully separated. Selenium determination was carried out by monitoring 80Se. The internal standard Ge was added into the mobile phase. The calibration was linear at least up to 100 μg L-1 Se for all species. The limit of detection was 0.4 μg L-1 Se. When higher (1400 W) ICP power was applied, the calibration based solely on selenate provided accurate results for all species. Stability tests revealed extremely short stability of selenite. After collection, the urine samples should be acidified to pH 3.0, stored below –5 °C, and analyzed before 12 h after collection. The method was used for the short-time (single capsule, one day observation, 5 persons) monitoring of the excretion of selenium after ingestion of Se-containing dietary supplements. When a formulation containing selenate was applied, almost 50% of Se was excreted during 24 h (mostly in the unchanged form of selenate) and the plasma Se remained unaltered. In the case of organically bound Se, only 8% of Se was lost by urination during 24 h as selenite, Se-methylselenocysteine, selenomethionine, and unknown species. Subsequently, a statistically significant increase of plasma Se was observed. © 2015 The Author(s). Published by Taylor & Francis.},

Despite a great deal of research, the debate regarding how to screen and treat patients reremains tense and controversial. This review seeks to summarize the management of VUR with emphasis on recent published findings in the literature and how they contribute to this debate. The goals of managing VUR include preventing future febrile urinary tract infections [FUTI], renal scarring, reflux nephropathy and hypertension. The topdown approach with upper tract imaging and selective vesicocystourethrogram [VCUG] is an emerging alternative approach in the evaluation of children after their first FUTI. The elimination of bladder and bowel dysfunction [BBD] is an important management strategy to prevent further FUTIs, regardless of treatment choice. Antibiotic prophylaxis is a safe and effective modality to sterilize the urinary tract. Endoscopic treatment of VUR is an attractive modality in select patients, although some concerns remain regarding its effectiveness and durability as compared to the gold standard of open or laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy. Lastly, further research is required to determine the most effective algorithm to evaluate the pediatric patient after the first febrile UTI. © Rensing and Austin.},

Physical, chemical and biological factors of the marine environment, water and sediment in living mollusks (water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, total hydrocarbons, organohalogenated substances-pesticides, heavy metals, faecal coliforms) were analysed by the analytical methods set out in Annex to Directive No 2006/113/EC and Government Order No 201/2002. The main species monitored were the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the rapa welk Rapana venosa. Total suspended solids had overall low values without impact on water quality. Water temperature was not influenced by point discharges. Salinity evinced values below the minimum recommended threshold of 12‰ in all areas. Dissolved oxygen filled well to the requirements in all areas (100%). The presence of petroleum hydrocarbons films was visually assessed, but was not reported within the investigated areas. Organohalogenated substances (pesticides) were identified both in water and sediments but within concentrations allowed by Ministerial Order No 1888/2007. Heavy metals concentration in seawater, except Ni (80% compliance) in area 3 and Cr in area 4 (90% compliance) was according to the requirements. Overall organohalogenated substances and heavy metals contamination was extremely low and their concentration in mollusks meat did not present a threat for human consumption. Faecal coliforms were present in mollusks at concentrations below the threshold. © SGEM2015.},

abstract={The best economics for energy efficiency improvements occur in new plant designs and major plant expansions. Basic technology selection, heat integration, specifications for equipment items such as high-efficiency motors, pumps and compressors, control schemes, insulation, and utility plant choices can all have a major impact on energy performance. Unfortunately, many opportunities to achieve these benefits are lost because of pressure to minimize investment and concerns about project schedule. Energy efficiency workshops and process flow diagram (PFD) reviews are very effective procedures for identifying the energy-efficiency issues in any given design and identifying improvements. An energy efficiency workshop, in its simplest form, is a review of standard features that can be incorporated into a design to enhance energy performance. The review highlights the elements that have been incorporated in a preliminary design and reveals opportunities that have been left on the table. Process flow diagram (PFD) reviews provide a very down-to-earth and practical approach to the problem of finding more specific energy efficiency improvement opportunities. Preliminary PFDs are available early in the life of most projects. The review consists of a systematic evaluation of the PFD documents, combined with structured brainstorming. Typical results from PFD reviews include process improvements ranging from simple piping modifications and changes in control philosophy to equipment upgrades and major design changes. This paper discusses the use of these simple tools to improve project economics. Case studies are presented to illustrate the types of opportunities that are typically identified.},

abstract={Kuwait has witnessed major socioeconomic and industrial development in recent decades. Consequently, a variety of contaminants related to these activities have been discharged directly into the marine environment. This paper describes the application of a histopathology baseline survey in two potential sentinel species, the Giant sea catfish (Arius thalassinus) and the Fourlined terapon (Pelates quadrilineatus) to assess the health of biota inhabiting Kuwait's marine environment. Histological analysis revealed several lesion types in both species, although the prevalence was generally considered low with no discernible differences between sampling locations. The analysis of contaminant burdens (metals, PCBs, PBDEs, HBCDD) in A. thalassinus, along with the analysis of bile for PAH metabolites in both species, indicated that levels of contaminant exposure was low. Overall the data show that both species appear to be susceptible to pathologies associated with environmental contaminants and therefore suitable for further investigation as sentinel organisms for biological effects monitoring. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: The exposome encompasses all life-course environmental exposures from the prenatal period onward that influence health. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are interesting entities within this concept as markers and causation of disease. MicroRNAs are short oligonucleotide sequences that can interact with several mRNA targets. Objectives: We reviewed the current state of the field on the potential of using miRNAs as biomarkers for environmental exposure. We investigated miRNA signatures in response to all types of environmental exposure to which a human can be exposed, including cigarette smoke, air pollution, nanoparticles, and diverse chemicals; and we examined the health conditions for which the identified miRNAs have been reported (i.e., cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes). Methods: We searched the PubMed and ScienceDirect databases to identify relevant studies. Results: For all exposures incorporated in this review, 27 miRNAs were differentially expressed in at least two independent studies. miRNAs that had expression alterations associated with smoking observed in multiple studies are miR‑21, miR‑34b, miR‑125b, miR‑146a, miR‑223, and miR‑340; and those miRNAs that were observed in multiple air pollution studies are miR‑9, miR‑10b, miR‑21, miR‑128, miR‑143, miR‑155, miR‑222, miR‑223, and miR‑338. We found little overlap among in vitro, in vivo, and human studies between miRNAs and exposure. Here, we report on disease associations for those miRNAs identified in multiple studies on exposure. Conclusions: miRNA changes may be sensitive indicators of the effects of acute and chronic environmental exposure. Therefore, miRNAs are valuable novel biomarkers for exposure. Further studies should elucidate the role of the mediation effect of miRNA between exposures and effect through all stages of life to pprovide a more accurate assessment of the consequences of miRNA changes. © 2015, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

abstract={Microbial dehalogenation is a biochemical process in which the halogenated substances are catalyzed enzymatically in to their non-halogenated form. The microorganisms have a wide range of organohalogen degradation ability both explicit and non-specific in nature. Most of these halogenated organic compounds being pollutants need to be remediated; therefore, the current approaches are to explore the potential of microbes at a molecular level for effective biodegradation of these substances. Several microorganisms with dehalogenation activity have been identified and characterized. In this aspect, the bioinformatics plays a key role to gain deeper knowledge in this field of dehalogenation. To facilitate the data mining, many tools have been developed to annotate these data from databases. Therefore, with the discovery of a microorganism one can predict a gene/protein, sequence analysis, can perform structural modelling, metabolic pathway analysis, biodegradation study and so on. This review highlights various methods of bioinformatics approach that describes the application of various databases and specific tools in the microbial dehalogenation fields with special focus on dehalogenase enzymes. Attempts have also been made to decipher some recent applications of in silico modeling methods that comprise of gene finding, protein modelling, Quantitative Structure Biodegradibility Relationship (QSBR) study and reconstruction of metabolic pathways employed in dehalogenation research area.},

abstract={Background: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a non-invasive method for the assessment of breast lesions. The accuracy of CEUS in diagnosing of breast cancer has never been systematically assessed. Purpose: To determine the overall performance of CEUS in the differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions using meta- Analysis. Material and Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and article references published before October 2012 were searched. Published studies that used histopathologic results as golden reference to assess the diagnostic performance of CEUS in patients suspected of having breast cancer and the data necessary to calculate the diagnostic results were included. The qualities of eligible studies for final meta- Analysis were assessed by using the quality assessment of diagnostic studies (QUADAS) instrument. Sensitivity, specificity, summary receiver-operating characteristic (sROC) curves, and area under the curve were calculated to examine the diagnostic performance of CEUS. Results: Of 16 eligible studies, 957 breast lesions were included in the original meta- Analysis, among which heterogeneity arising from factors other than threshold effect was explored. Meta-regression analysis confirmed the contrast agent was the most significant factor cause of heterogeneity (P=0.0012, relative diagnostic odds ratio [DOR]=7.06). The use of perfluoro containing microbubbles (Sonovue or Optison) significantly increased the diagnostic precision compared with Levovist. The pooled weighted estimates of sensitivity and specificity for CEUS in the diagnosis of breast lesions were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83, 0.89) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75, 0.83), respectively. Conclusion: CEUS has good sensitivity and specificity in the characterization of breast lesions and can potentially help to select suspicious breast mass for surgery. © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2014.},

abstract={Parabens are a family of synthetic esters of p-hydroxibenzoic acid widely used as preservatives in cosmetics and health-care products, among other daily-use commodities. Recently, their potential endocrine disrupting effects have raised concerns about their safety and their potential effects as emerging pollutants, leading to the regulation of the presence of parabens in commercial products by national and trans-national organizations. Also, this has led to an interest in developing sensible and reliable methods for their determination in environmental samples, cosmetics and health-care products. This paper is a comprehensive up-to-date review of the literature concerning the determination of parabens in environmental samples and cosmetic and health-care products. A brief revision of the literature concerning the traditional determination of parabens (1980-2003) is included, followed by an in-depth revision of the recent developments in both measurement and extraction methods for parabens in the last years (2003-2013). Finally, possible future perspectives in this field are proposed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The most commonly studied PFASs are perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Animal studies indicate that maternal PFAS exposure is associated with reduced fetal growth. However, the results of human studies are inconsistent. Objectives: To summarize the evidence of an association between exposure to PFASs, particularly PFOS and PFOA, and human fetal growth. Methods: Systematic literature searches were performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE. We included original studies on pregnant women with measurements of PFOA or PFOS in maternal blood during pregnancy or the umbilical cord and associations with birth weight or related outcomes according to the PFAS level. Citations and references from the included articles were investigated to locate more relevant articles. Study characteristics and results were extracted to structured tables. The completeness of reporting as well as the risk of bias and confounding were assessed. Results: Fourteen studies were eligible. In utero PFOA exposure was associated with decreased measures of continuous birth weight in all studies, even though the magnitude of the association differed and many results were statistically insignificant. PFOS exposure and birth weight were associated in some studies, while others found no association. Conclusions: Higher PFOS and PFOA concentrations were associated with decreased average birth weight in most studies, but only some results were statistically significant. The impact on public health is unclear, but the global exposure to PFASs warrants further investigation. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

abstract={Synthetic musks have been used for a long time in personal care and household products. In recent years, this continuous input has increased considerably, to the point that they were recognized as emerging pollutants by the scientific community, due to their persistence in the environment, and hazardous potential to ecosystems even at low concentrations. The number of studies in literature describing their worldwide presence in several environmental matrices is growing, and many of them indicate that the techniques employed for their safe removal tend to be ineffective. This is the case of conventional activated sludge treatment plants (WWTPs), where considerable loads of synthetic musks enter mainly through domestic sewage. This review paper compiles and discusses the occurrence of these compounds in the sewage, effluents and sludge, main concentration levels and phase distributions, as well as the efficiency of the different methodologies of removal applied in these treatment facilities. To the present day, it has been demonstrated that WWTPs lack the ability to remove musks completely. This shows a clear need to develop new effective and cost-efficient remediation approaches and foresees potential for further improvements in this field. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The resulting data were subjected to chemometric analysis (principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis) to investigate the effect of SU antidiabetic drugs on urinary metabolite profiles of T2DM patients. Biomarkers such as xanthine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, hippurate, phenylacetylglutamine, carnitine C8:1, carnitine C10:3, uric acid and citrate were found to be responsible for the separation of T2DM and SU-treated groups, which indicates a potential effect of SU on energy metabolism, Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, gut microflora metabolism and oxidative stress.

During the last decade our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the formation of these compounds has grown. This critical review summarizes our current understanding and uncertainties on the mechanisms leading to the formation of natural trichloromethyl compounds. The objective of the review is to gather information regarding the natural processes that lead to the formation of trichloromethyl compounds and then to compare these mechanisms with the much more comprehensive literature on the reactions occurring during chemical chlorination of organic material. It turns out that the reaction mechanisms during chemical chlorination are likely to be similar to those occurring naturally and that significant knowledge may therefore be transferred between the scientific disciplines of chemical chlorination and natural organohalogens. There is however still a need for additional research before we understand fully the mechanisms occurring during the formation of natural trichloromethyl compounds and open questions and future research needs are identified in the last part of the review. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Patients' case notes referred to the Birmingham Regional Skin Laser Centre between 2003 and 2011 for laser hair removal, with indications other than hirsutism, were reviewed retrospectively. Thirty-one treated patients with the following indications were identified: hair-bearing skin grafts/flaps, intra-oral hair-bearing flap, Becker's naevus, localised nevoid hypertrichosis, peristomal hair-bearing skin, scrotal skin prior to vaginoplasty in male-to-female (MTF) gender reassignment, pilonidal sinus disease (PSD), pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Seven patients with the following indications have been reported before: intra-oral hair-bearing graft, naevoid hypertrichosis and peristomal hair-bearing skin. A clinical review of the evidence available for each indication is provided. Our experience and that in the published literature suggest that LHR is a safe, well-tolerated and effective treatment modality for the indications we report, leading to significant symptom and functional improvement with high patient satisfaction. LHR appears effective in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions such as PSD, PFB and HS, particularly at an early disease stage. We aim to increase awareness of the diversity of laser hair removal indications and add evidence to the medical literature of the wide range of indications for this useful treatment modality. © 2013, Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={Background: Which surgical strategy is the best one for intertrochanteric fractures remains a controversial issue. Dynamic hip screw (DHS) and Gamma nail were commonly used but often associated with some complications, such as fixation failure and implant-related fractures. Meanwhile, proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA) fixation has recently been developed for minimally invasive surgery to reduce the complications rate. To facilitate the clinical decision-making, we conducted an updated meta-analysis to discuss the optimal treatment of intertrochanteric fractures aiming to determine which implant gives the lower rates of blood loss, complications (peri-implant fracture, fixation failure, infection, thromboembolic), reoperation, and mortality, as well as the minimal duration related to surgery (fluoroscopic exposure, surgery and hospital stay). Patients and methods: Seven electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (including OVID, Springer, Google Scholar, PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, and Web of Science). Fourteen studies with 1983 patients were included. The modified Jadad Scale was used to assess the methodological quality of these studies. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Comparison among the three groups was based on twelve indicators, including operative time, fluoroscopy time, operative blood loss, length of hospital stays, wound infection or hematoma, pneumonia, thromboembolic complications, fixation failure, operative fracture of femur, later fracture of femur, reoperation, and mortality. Results: (1) PFNA group versus DHS group: PFNA was associated with less blood loss (mean difference (MD) -253.86, 95% CI -270.25 to 237.47; P< 0.00001) and lower rate of fixation failure (MD 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.59; P= 0.004), but led to more fluoroscopy time (MD 2.11, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.43; P< 0.00001). (2) PFNA group versus Gamma nail group: PFNA led to less blood loss (MD -55.30, 95% CI -60.07 to -50.53; P< 0.00001), shorter fluoroscopy time (MD -0.50, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.45; P< 0.00001) and length of hospital stay (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.13; P< 0.00001). (3) DHS group versus Gamma nail group: DHS was associated with lower rate of operative fracture of femur (MD 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.89; P= 0.03), later fracture of femur (MD 0.16, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.43; P= 0.0004), and reoperation (MD 0.49, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.88; P= 0.02), but caused more blood loss (MD 29.49, 95% CI 8.27 to 50.70; P= 0.006). In contrast, there was no difference regarding operative time, infection hematoma, pneumonia, thromboembolic events, and mortality. Discussion: PFNA should be a priority choice for treatment of intertrochanteric fractures with minimal rate of fixation failure, less blood loss and shorter length of hospital stay. DHS has distinct advantages over Gamma nail with lower rate of plant-related complications and should be preferred device for intertrochanteric fractures. However, owing to the low quality evidence currently available, more high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm these findings. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract={In patients with patent foramen ovales (PFOs) and cryptogenic stroke, observational studies have demonstrated reductions in recurrent neurologic events with transcatheter PFO closure compared with medical therapy. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have shown a trend toward benefit with device closure. The cost-effectiveness of PFO closure has not been described. Therefore, a detailed cost analysis was performed using pooled weighted outcome and complication rates from published randomized controlled trials, Medicare cost tables, and wholesale medication prices. Incremental cost per life-year gained and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained by PFO closure was calculated. The commonly accepted cost-effectiveness threshold of <$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained was used. At 2.6 years (the mean duration of randomized controlled trial follow-up), PFO closure was more costly ($16,213, 95% confidence interval [CI] $15,753 to $16,749) per patient, with a cost of $103,607 (95% CI $5,826 to $2,544,750) per life-year gained. The expenditure to prevent 1 combined end point (transient ischemic attack, stroke, and death) at 2.6 years was $1.09 million (95% CI $1.04 million to $1.20 million). Modeling the costs of medical treatment prospectively, PFO closure reached cost-effectiveness (<$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained) at 2.6 years (95% CI 1.5 to 44.2). At 30.2 years (95% CI 28.2 to 36.2), the per patient mean cost of medical therapy exceeded that of PFO closure. In conclusion, PFO closure is associated with higher expenditures related to procedural costs; however, this increase may be offset over time by reduced event rates and costs of long-term medical treatment in patients who undergo transcatheter PFO closure. In younger patients typical of cryptogenic stroke, PFO closure may be cost effective in the long term. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Various studies have indicated a relationship between enteric methane (CH4) production and milk fatty acid (FA) profiles of dairy cattle. However, the number of studies investigating such a relationship is limited and the direct relationships reported are mainly obtained by variation in CH4 production and milk FA concentration induced by dietary lipid supplements. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to quantify relationships between CH4 yield (per unit of feed and unit of milk) and milk FA profile in dairy cattle and to develop equations to predict CH4 yield based on milk FA profile of cows fed a wide variety of diets. Data from 8 experiments encompassing 30 different dietary treatments and 146 observations were included. Yield of CH4 measured in these experiments was 21.5±2.46g/kg of dry matter intake (DMI) and 13.9±2.30g/kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM). Correlation coefficients were chosen as effect size of the relationship between CH4 yield and individual milk FA concentration (g/100g of FA). Average true correlation coefficients were estimated by a random-effects model. Milk FA concentrations of C6:0, C8:0, C10:0, C16:0, and C16:0-iso were significantly or tended to be positively related to CH4 yield per unit of feed. Concentrations of trans-6+7+8+9 C18:1, trans-10+11 C18:1, cis-11 C18:1, cis-12 C18:1, cis-13 C18:1, trans-16+cis-14 C18:1, and cis-9,12 C18:2 in milk fat were significantly or tended to be negatively related to CH4 yield per unit of feed. Milk FA concentrations of C10:0, C12:0, C14:0-iso, C14:0, cis-9 C14:1, C15:0, and C16:0 were significantly or tended to be positively related to CH4 yield per unit of milk. Concentrations of C4:0, C18:0, trans-10+11 C18:1, cis-9 C18:1, cis-11 C18:1, and cis-9,12 C18:2 in milk fat were significantly or tended to be negatively related to CH4 yield per unit of milk. Mixed model multiple regression and a stepwise selection procedure of milk FA based on the Bayesian information criterion to predict CH4 yield with milk FA as input (g/100g of FA) resulted in the following prediction equations: CH4 (g/kg of DMI)=23.39 + 9.74 × C16:0-iso - 1.06 × trans-10+11 C18:1 - 1.75 × cis-9,12 C18:2 (R2=0.54), and CH4 (g/kg of FPCM)=21.13 - 1.38 × C4:0 + 8.53 × C16:0-iso - 0.22 × cis-9 C18:1 - 0.59 × trans-10+11 C18:1 (R2=0.47). This indicated that milk FA profile has a moderate potential for predicting CH4 yield per unit of feed and a slightly lower potential for predicting CH4 yield per unit of milk. © 2014 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract={Proximal femoral arthroplasty (PFA) is an established treatment modality following oncological resection. Increasingly, these prostheses are being used for non-neoplastic conditions such as fractures and bone loss associated with septic or aseptic loosening. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the failure rates, mortality rates and hip outcome scores when PFAs were used in non-neoplastic conditions. There were 14 studies with an average follow-up of 3.8. years (range 0-14. years) describing 356 PFAs. Re-operation for any reason occurred in 23.8% (85/356) of cases. The most common complications were dislocation (15.7%) and infection (7.6%). The mortality rate ranged from 0% to 40%. PFA provides an acceptable surgical solution when confronted with massive bone loss, but it has a high re-operation rate for dislocation and infection. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

It is well-known that for an efficient early commercialisation of this technology it is necessary to develop a proton exchange membrane with high proton conductivity without water dependency capable of working at temperatures above 100. °C. The use of ionic liquids as electrolytes in electrochemical devices is an emerging field due to their high conductivity, as well as their thermal, chemical and electrochemical stability under anhydrous conditions.

abstract={Concerns over effects of halogenated persistent environmental contaminants on the developing brain have been expressed for many years, and human biomonitoring has confirmed that low-level, prenatal and/or postnatal exposure of children to these chemicals is ubiquitous. Over the last decade there have been increasing reports in the epidemiological literature of the potential association of exposure to polybromo diphenylethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) with neurodevelopmental and/or neurobehavioural effects in infants and children, such as adverse birth outcomes, cognitive deficits, developmental delay and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). However, direct evidence from epidemiology studies has been limited and contradictory. Given the general lack of comparability across studies in terms of design, conduct, methodology and reporting, we developed a checklist-type quality assessment scheme based on the STROBE guidelines and the proposed HONEES criteria, and conducted a systematic review of the epidemiological peer-reviewed literature published since 2006 on neurodevelopmental and/or neurobehavioural effects following prenatal and postnatal exposure to PBDEs and PFCs. We rated 7 of the 18 studies that met our inclusion criteria as being of high quality, 7 of moderate quality and 4 of low quality. Frequently observed shortcomings were the lack of consideration of confounding factors; uncertainties regarding exposure characterization; inadequate sample size; the lack of a clear dose-response; and the representativeness/generalizability of the results. Collectively, the epidemiological evidence does currently not support a strong causal association between PBDEs and PFCs and adverse neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioural outcomes in infants and children. However, despite their limitations, the studies raise questions that require further investigation through hypothesis-driven studies using more harmonized study designs and methodologies, more detailed exposure assessments and repeated testing with larger study populations. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={Global software companies are restructuring their IT area by extending operations to offshore software development centers. Thus, follow -The-sun (FTS) development is seen as a potential software development strategy for these companies. But so far, FTS is relatively understudied (only nine empirical studies published). Moreover, the success cases of FTS usage in the software industry are still small. The lack of studies to close the gap between theory and practice is observed as the main barrier to the FTS evolution. In this study, we present a framework to support research on FTS software development. The proposed framework aims to support empirical studies and meta-analysis on FTS. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we propose an initial framework for researching FTS software development, including independent, dependent and context variables. Additionally, we discuss research challenges, and directions for future research. Our paper aims to provide both a guide and motivation for researchers to better understand how to research FTS and to develop new theories in the area. © 2014 IEEE.},

From 1893, when it was first documented in humans by Pozzi, the research and clinical management of VUR has been marked by pendulum swings through the decades. Initially, the vesicoureteral junction was the main subject of study, whereas current practice takes into account the bladder and bowel dynamics. The primary objective, however, is unchanged: preservation of the kidney and its function. Management of the condition has included open surgery, minimally invasive surgery, endoscopic treatment, antibiotic prophylaxis, and watchful waiting.

We rated both the human and nonhuman mammalian evidence as “moderate” quality and “sufficient” strength. Integration of these evidence ratings produced a final strength of evidence rating in which review authors concluded that PFOA is “known to be toxic” to human reproduction and development based on sufficient evidence of decreased fetal growth in both human and nonhuman mammalian species.Conclusion: We concluded that developmental exposure to PFOA adversely affects human health based on sufficient evidence of decreased fetal growth in both human and nonhuman mammalian species. The results of this case study demonstrate the application of a systematic and transparent methodology, via the Navigation Guide, for reaching strength of evidence conclusions in environmental health. © 2014, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

This extraction and analysis procedure allows forensic analysts to differentiate between drivers who have used "crack cocaine" against those using regular cocaine. Samples of whole blood (containing deuterated internal standards) were diluted with an aqueous phosphate buffer (pH 6). Each sample was applied to a conditioned SPE column. The filtrate was collected and adjusted to pH 2. The sorbent was rinsed with deionized (DI) water, aqueous hydrochloric acid and methanol. After drying, cocaine, cocathylene, benzoylecgnonine, and anhydroecgnonine methyl ester were eluted from the SPE column with 3 mL of an elution solvent consisting of methylene chloride-isopropanol-ammonium hydroxide. The original filtrate was applied to a second conditioned SPE column and washed with DI water, aqueous hydrochloric acid and methanol. After drying the SPE sorbent, anhydroecgnonine was eluted with methanol containing 4% ammonium hydroxide (3 mL). The eluates were combined and evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in the mobile phase for analysis by LC-MS/MS in positive multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM). Chromatography was performed in gradient mode employing a C18 column and a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.1% aqueous formic acid. The total run time for each analysis was within five minutes. The limits of quantitation/detection for this method were determined to be 0.5 ng mL-1 and 1.0 ng mL-1 respectively. The method was found to be linear from 1.0 ng mL-1 to 100.0 ng mL-1 (r2 &gt; 0.995). The recoveries of the noted cocaine type drugs were found to be greater than 90%. This method was applied to twenty positive cocaine completed drugs and driving cases, it was found that anhydroecgnonine concentrations ranged from 0 ng mL-1 to 23 ng mL-1, anhydroecgonine methyl ester concentrations ranged from 0 ng mL-1 to 66 ng mL-1, while cocaine was found to range from 25 ng mL-1 to 250 ng mL-1, cocaethylene ranged from 0 ng mL-1 to 80 ng mL-1, benzoylecgnonine concentrations were found to be in the range 90 ng mL-1 to 790 ng mL-1, ecgonine methyl ester concentrations ranged from 40 ng mL-1 to 500 ng mL-1 and ecgonine ethyl ester concentrations were found to be in the range 0 ng mL-1 to 180 ng mL-1. © the Partner Organisations 2014.},

abstract={Background: Intramedullary nails may be used for the surgical fixation of extracapsular hip fractures in adults. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005 and last updated in 2008. Objectives: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different designs of intramedullary nails for treating extracapsular hip fractures in adults. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (6 January 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 12, 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to November Week 3, 2013), MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (3 January 2014), EMBASE (1988 to 2014, Week 1) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (accessed January 2014). Selection criteria: All randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing different types, or design modifications, of intramedullary nails in the treatment of extracapsular hip fractures in adults. Data collection and analysis: At least two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We performed limited meta-analysis using the fixed-effect model. Main results: We included eight new trials, testing seven new comparisons in this update. Overall, we included 17 trials, testing 12 comparisons of different cephalocondylic nail designs. The trials involved a total of 2130 adults (predominantly female and older people) with mainly unstable trochanteric fractures. All trials were at unclear risk of bias for most domains, with the majority at high risk of detection bias for subjective outcomes. The three quasi-randomised trials were at high risk for selection bias. Four trials (910 participants) compared the proximal femoral nail (PFN) with the Gamma nail. There was no significant difference between the two implants in functional outcome (the very low quality evidence being limited to results from single trials), mortality (low quality evidence: 86/415 versus 80/415; risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.41), serious fixation complications (operative fracture of the femur, cut-out, non-union and later fracture of the femur) nor re-operations (low quality evidence: 45/455 versus 36/455; RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.90). Two trials (185 participants) provided very low quality evidence of a lack of clinically significant difference in outcome (functional score, mortality, fracture fixation complications and re-operation) between the ACE trochanteric nail and the Gamma nail. Two trials (200 participants) provided very low quality evidence of a lack of significant difference in outcome (mobility score, pain, fracture fixation complications or re-operations) between the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) nail and the Gamma 3 nail. Seven of the nine trials evaluating different comparisons provided very low quality evidence of a lack of significant between-group differences in all of the reported main outcomes for the following comparisons: ACE trochanteric nail versus Gamma 3 nail (112 participants); gliding nail versus Gamma nail (80 participants); Russell-Taylor Recon nail versus long Gamma nail (34 participants, all under 50 years); proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) nail versus Targon PF nail (80 participants); dynamically versus statically locked intramedullary hip screw (IMHS) nail (81 participants); sliding versus non-sliding Gamma 3 nail (80 participants, all under 60 years); and long versus standard PFNA nails (40 participants with reverse oblique fractures). The other two single comparison trials also provided very low quality evidence of a lack of significant between-group differences in all of the main outcomes with single exceptions. The trial (215 participants) comparing the ENDOVIS nail versus the IMHS nail found low quality evidence of poorer mobility in the ENDOVIS nail group, where more participants in this group were bedridden after their operation (29/105 versus 18/110; RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.85; P = 0.05). The trial (113 participants) comparing the InterTan nail versus the PFNA II nail found very low quality evidence that more PFNA II group participants experienced thigh pain (3/47 versus 12/46; RR: 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.81). Authors' conclusions: The limited evidence from the randomised trials undertaken to date is insufficient to determine whether there are important differences in outcome between different designs of intramedullary nails used in treating extracapsular hip fractures. Given the evidence of superiority of the sliding hip screw compared with intramedullary nails for extracapsular hip fractures, further studies comparing different designs of intramedullary nails are not a priority. Any new design should be evaluated in a randomised comparison with the sliding hip screw. © 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration.},

abstract={Background: Both laparoscopic and fast-track surgery (FTS) have shown some advantages in colorectal surgery. However, the effectiveness of using both methods together is unclear. We performed this meta-analysis to compare the effects of FTS with those of traditional perioperative care in laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery.Methods: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Ovid databases for eligible studies until April 2014. The main end points were the duration of the postoperative hospital stay, time to first flatus after surgery, time of first bowel movement, total postoperative complication rate, readmission rate, and mortality.Results: Five randomized controlled trials and 5 clinical controlled trials with 1,317 patients were eligible for analysis. The duration of the postoperative hospital stay (weighted mean difference [WMD], -1.64 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.25 to -1.03; p < 0.001), time to first flatus (WMD, -0.40 day; 95% CI, -0.77 to -0.04; p = 0.03), time of first bowel movement (WMD, -0.98 day; 95% CI, -1.45 to -0.52; p < 0.001), and total postoperative complication rate (risk ratio [RR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.56-0.80; p < 0.001) were significantly reduced in the FTS group. No significant differences were noted in the readmission rate (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41-1.01; p = 0.06) or mortality (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 0.42-5.71; p = 0.51).Conclusion: Among patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery, FTS is associated with a significantly shorter postoperative hospital stay, more rapid postoperative recovery, and, notably, greater safety than is expected from traditional care. © 2014 Zhao et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Heavy metal contamination of water can be toxic to humans and wildlife; thus the development of methods to detect this contamination is of high importance. Here we describe the design and application of DNA-based fluorescent chemosensors on microbeads to differentiate eight toxic metal ions in water. We developed and synthesized four fluorescent 2′-deoxyribosides of metal-binding ligands. A tetramer-length oligodeoxy-fluoroside (ODF) library of 6561 members was constructed and screened for sequences responsive to metal ions, of which seven sequences were selected. Statistical analysis of the response patterns showed successful differentiation of the analytes at concentrations as low as 100 nM. Sensors were able to classify water samples from 13 varied sites and quantify metal contamination in unknown specimens. The results demonstrate the practical potential of bead-based ODF chemosensors to analyze heavy metal contamination in water samples by a simple and inexpensive optical method. Detecting metal contamination in surface/ground water is crucial for protecting human health. The design and synthesis of metal-binding fluorescent nucleosides and development of a sensor array with DNA-polyfluorophores on beads is described, as well as their ability to detect and differentiate environmental contaminants in water. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Bifunctional systems are classified by the proximity between FTS and acid functionalities on three levels: reactor, catalyst particle, and active phase. A thorough analysis of the published literature on this topic reveals that efficiency in the production of liquid fuels correlates well with the proximity of FTS and acid sites. Moreover, possible side reactions over the FTS metal, including direct CO hydrogenation and hydrocarbon hydrogenolysis, are addressed. The contribution of these side reactions should carefully be considered and separated from that of the zeolite function when evaluating the performance and product spectrum of zeolite-containing catalysts.

Meta-analyses showed that, as compared with DHS, PFNA could significantly decrease fixation failure rate (odds ratio (OR) =0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.12, 0.57], P = 0.0008), reduce average fracture healing time (weighted mean difference (WMD) = - 15.11, 95% CI = [- 24.36, - 5.85], P = 0.001), improve excellent and good rate for Harris score (OR = 0.29, 95% CI = [0.15, 0.56], P = 0.0002), yield a higher Harris score (WMD = 6.88, 95% CI = [0.96, 12.80], P = 0.02) and reduce the rate of coxa vara (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = [0.18, 0.92], P = 0.03). However, there was no statistical significance in 1-year mortality, postoperative nonunion and delayed union, postoperative femoral head necrosis, postoperative femoral fractures or femoral head necrosis. The importance of outcomes was "critical". And the level of evidences based on the GRADE approach was from "very low" to "low". Conclusion: PFNA is superior to DHS. Due to the limitations of the included studies, more large-sample and high-quality RCTs are required. And subgroup analysis based on fracture types should be performed.

abstract={We studied distribution of heavy metals [lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn)] in surface soil at an electronic-waste (e-waste) recycling workshop near Metro Manila in the Philippines to evaluate the pollution size (spot size, small area or the entire workshop), as well as to assess heavy metal transport into the surrounding soil environment. On-site length-of-stride-scale (~70 cm) measurements were performed at each surface soil point using field-portable X-ray fluorescence (FP-XRF). The surface soil at the e-waste recycling workshop was polluted with Cu, Zn and Pb, which were distributed discretely in surface soil. The site was divided into five areas based on the distance from an entrance gate (y-axis) of the e-waste recycling workshop. The three heavy metals showed similar concentration gradients in the y-axis direction. Zn, Pb and Cu concentrations were estimated to decrease to half of their maximum concentrations at ~3, 7 and 7 m from the pollution spot, respectively, inside the informal e-waste recycling workshop. Distance from an entrance may play an important role in heavy metal transport at the soil surface. Using on-site FP-XRF, we evaluated the metal ratio to characterise pollution features of the solid surface. Variability analysis of heavy metals revealed vanishing surficial autocorrelation over metre ranges. Also, the possibility of concentration prediction at unmeasured points using geostatistical kriging was evaluated, and heavy metals had a relative "small" pollution scales and remained inside the original workshop compared with toxic organohalogen compounds. Thus, exposure to heavy metals may directly influence the health of e-waste workers at the original site rather than the surrounding habitat and environmental media. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Inflammation plays a critical defensive role in the human body. However, uncontrolled or aberrant inflammatory responses contribute to various acute and chronic diseases. The Nrf2-ARE pathway plays a pivotal role in the regulation of inflammatory markers, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). On the basis of this concept, we synthesized a novel anti-inflammatory 4,6-bis ((E)-4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyryl)-1-phenethylpyrimidine- 2(1H)-thione (HPT), and in vitro experiments using HepG2-C8 ARE-luciferase- transfected cells demonstrated the induction of Nrf2-ARE activity. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells, HPT treatment reduced the production of nitric oxide (NO) as well as the protein and mRNA expression levels of COX-2 and iNOS, in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, HPT suppressed the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. In LPS-induced macrophages, HPT inhibited COX-2 and iNOS by blocking the activation of p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). Furthermore, an in vivo anti-inflammatory study was performed using a TPA-induced skin inflammation mouse model, and the results showed that HPT reduced TPA-induced inflammation and attenuated the expression of COX-2 and iNOS in TPA-induced mouse skin tissue. Thus, HPT demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity both in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells and TPA-stimulated mouse skin and may therefore serve as a potential anti-inflammatory agent. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state of research activities on the application of constructed wetlands for removing pharmaceutical contaminants from wastewater. The focus of the review was placed on the application of constructed wetlands as an alternative secondary wastewater treatment system or as a wastewater polishing treatment system. The design parameters of the reported constructed wetlands including the physical configuration, hydraulic mode, vegetation species, and targeting pharmaceuticals were summarized. The removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals under different conditions in the wetlands were evaluated at the macroscopic level. In addition, the importance of the three main components of constructed wetlands (substrate, plants and microbes) for pharmaceutical removal was analyzed to elucidate the possible removal mechanisms involved. There is a general consensus among many researchers that constructed wetlands hold great potential of being used as an alternative secondary wastewater treatment system or as a wastewater polishing treatment system for the removal of pharmaceuticals, but relevant reported studies are scarce and are not conclusive in their findings. Current knowledge is limited on the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals in constructed wetlands, the removal mechanisms involved, the toxicity to constructed wetlands caused by pharmaceuticals, and the influences of certain important parameters (configuration design, hydraulic mode, temperature and seasonality, pH, oxygen and redox potential, etc.). This review promotes further research on these issues to provide more and better convincing evidences for the function and performance of larger laboratory-scale, pilot-scale or full-scale constructed wetlands. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The advent of composite co-cured and co-bonded integrated construction in aircraft structures has lead to the replacement of fastened joints with bonded joints between the skins and the stiffeners. Skin-stiffener debondings could occur due to impact or other operational reasons and it is usually internal failure. Damage identification of bonded components, which are often vital elements in many structures, is crucial for the prevention of failure of the entire structure. Thus, different researchers have investigated vibration-based methods as an alternative technique to be used in the structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. Hence, this work consists of investigating experimentally through the vibration-based method, the dynamic behavior changes in a bonded metal-composite structure by using piezoelectric transducer and accelerometers in order to monitory the damage. The damage is an artificial debonding in the joint, which was simulated by inserting Teflon™ tapes within the joint. In-situ inspection as ensured by accelerometer and piezoelectric transducers (PZT) bonded to the structure. Indeed, with a simple comparison of the frequency response functions is difficult to conclude if there is damage in the structure, unless a large damage is presented. However, by using damage metrics, it is possible to identify the damage with more accuracy. Thus, the experimental results obtained by the accelerometers were compared to the data provided by the smart composite sensors (PZT). Finally, it was discussed the advantages and limitations of the experimental analyses and the identification technique proposal. © 2014, Medeiros et al.; licensee Springer.},

abstract={Non-invasive hormone analysis is a vital tool in assessing an animal's adrenal and reproductive status, which can be beneficial to in situ and ex situ conservation. However, it can be difficult to employ these techniques when monitoring in situ populations away from controlled laboratory conditions, when electricity is not readily available. A practical method for processing faecal samples in the field, which enables samples to be extracted soon after defaecation and stored in field conditions for prolonged periods prior to hormone analysis, is therefore warranted. This study describes the development of an optimal field extraction method, which includes hand-shaking faecal material in 90% methanol, before loading this extract in a 40% solvent onto HyperSep™ C8 solid-phase extraction cartridges, stored at ambient temperatures. This method was successfully validated for measurement of adrenal and reproductive hormone metabolites in faeces of male and female black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) and was rigorously tested in controlled laboratory and simulated field conditions. All the hormones tested demonstrated between 83 and 94% and between 42 and 89% recovery of synthetic and endogenous hormone metabolites, respectively, with high precision of replication. Furthermore, results obtained following the developed optimal field extraction method were highly correlated with the control laboratory method. Cartridges can be stored at ambient (cool, dry or warm, humid) conditions for periods of up to 6 months without degradation, before re-extraction of hormone metabolites for analysis by enzyme immunoassay. The described method has great potential to be applied to monitor faecal reproductive and adrenal hormone metabolites in a wide variety of species and allows samples to be stored in the field for up to 6 months prior to analysis. This provides the opportunity to investigate hormone relationships within in situ populations, where equipment and facilities may previously have been limiting. © The Author 2014.},

All studies, except one from Arctic Finland, were either from Nunavik or Greenland. Most studies assessed polychlorinated biphenyls (n=43) and organochlorine pesticides (n=29). Fewer studies examined heavy metals, perfluorinated compounds, or polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Details of study results for each health category are provided.CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to make conclusive statements about the effects of environmental contaminants on health due to mixed results, small number of studies and studies being restricted to a small number of regions. Meta-analytical synthesis of the evidence should be considered for priority contaminants and health outcomes. The following research gaps should be addressed in future studies: association of contaminants and health in other Arctic regions (i.e. Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Nunavut, Nunatsiavut, Alaska, European North and Russian North); assessment of contaminants on chronic diseases; inclusion of clinical endpoints in assessments; and assessment of the emerging contaminants of perfluorinated compounds and polybrominated diphenyl ethers.BACKGROUND: Since the 1990s, research has been carried out to monitor environmental contaminants and their effects on human health in the Arctic. Although evidence shows that Arctic indigenous peoples are exposed to higher levels of contaminants and do worse on several dimensions of health compared with other populations, the contribution of such exposures on adverse outcomes is unclear.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to provide a synopsis of the published epidemiological literature that has examined association between environmental contaminants and health outcomes in Arctic indigenous populations.DESIGN: A literature search was conducted in OVID Medline (1946-January 2014) using search terms that combined concepts of contaminant and indigenous populations in the Arctic. No language or date restrictions were applied. The reference lists of review articles were hand-searched.},

abstract={Groundwater pollution due to anthropogenic activities may impact overall groundwater quality. Organic and inorganic pollutants have been routinely detected at unsafe levels in groundwater rendering this important drinking water resource practically unusable. Vulnerability of groundwater pollution and subsequent impact has been documented in various studies across the globe. Field studies as well as mathematical models have demonstrated increasing levels of pollutants in both shallow and deep aquifer systems. New emerging pollutants such as organic micro-pollutants have also been detected in some industrialized as well as in developing countries. Increased vulnerability coupled with ever growing demand for groundwater may pose a greater threat of pollution due to induced recharge and lack of environmental safeguards to protect groundwater sources. In this review paper, comprehensive assessment of groundwater quality impact due to human activities such as improper management of organic and inorganic waste, and natural sources is documented. A detailed review of published reports and peer reviewed journal papers across the world clearly demonstrate that groundwater quality is declining over time. A proactive approach is needed to prevent human health and ecological consequences due to ingestion of contaminated groundwater. Copyright © 2014 Water Environment Federation.},

The aim of this study to assess the bioavailability and safety of SFAs as drug solvents for the topical ocular application of Cyclosporin A (CsA). A commercially available CsA formulation (Restasis®, 0.05% CsA in castor oil) was tested against two novel formulations of 0.05% CSA in (a) F4H5 containing Ethanol (0.5 w/w%) and (b) F6H8 containing Ethanol (0.5 w/w%) with 0.05% CsA. Formulations were tested on rabbit corneas cultured on an artificial anterior chamber with a constant flow of an aqueous humour supplement (Ex Vivo Eye Irritation Test (EVEIT) system). Anterior chamber fluids were sampled at multiple time points to analyse the CsA concentration following single and repeated application regimes by HPLC. Photographs of fluorescein sodium-stained corneas were recorded for corneal toxicity evaluation. The impact of the formulations on the integrity of the corneal barrier function was tested after drug application by fluorescein sodium corneal diffusion experiments. The influence on the corneal metabolism was evaluated by analysis of the metabolic markers glucose and lactate. Restasis® did not pass the corneal barrier after short term application, CsA in ethanolic F4H6 reached a maximum of 152.95 ng/ml in anterior chamber fluid samples whilst CsA in ethanolic F6H8 reached a maximum of 15.12 ng/ml. After repeated applications for 8 h, Restasis® reached 21.07 ng/ml compared to 247.62 ng/ml and 174.5 ng/ml for F4H5 and F6H8, respectively. No corneal toxicity was observed in following application of any of the formulations. In contrast to the commercially available castor oil-based formulation, CsA dissolved in SFAs reached therapeutic inner ocular concentrations after topical administration, possibly leading to the replacement of systemic applications of CsA for inflammatory ocular disease. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Fast-track surgery (FTS) is a promising program for surgical patients and has been applied to several surgical diseases. FTS is much superior to conventional perioperative care. Our aim was to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of FTS and conventional perioperative care for patients undergoing gastrectomy using a systematic review. Methods: We searched the literature in PubMed, SCOPUS, and EMBASE up to November 2013. No language restriction was applied. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and odds ratios (ORs) with their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were used for analysis by a fixed or a random effects model according to the heterogeneity assumption. Results: In the present meta-analysis, we included five randomized controlled trials and one controlled clinical trial from five studies. Compared with conventional care, FTS shortened the duration of flatus (WMD -21.08; 95 % CI -27.46 to -14.71, z = 6.48, p < 0.00001 in the open surgery group; WMD -8.20; 95 % CI -12.87 to -3.53, z = 3.44, p = 0.0006 in the laparoscopic surgery group), accelerated the decrease in C-reactive protein (WMD -15.56; 95 % CI 21.28 to 9.83, z = 5.33, p < 0.00001), shortened the postoperative stay (WMD -2.00; 95 % CI -2.69 to -1.30, z = 5.64, p < 0.00001), and reduced hospitalization costs (WMD -447.72; 95 % CI -615.92 to -279.51, z = 5.22, p < 0.00001). FTS made no significant difference in operation times (p = 0.93), intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.79), or postoperative complications (p = 0.07). Conclusions: Based on current evidence, the FTS protocol was feasible for gastric cancer patients who underwent gastrectomy (distal subtotal gastrectomy, proximal subtotal gastrectomy, or radical total gastrectomy) via open or laparoscopic surgery. Larger studies are needed to validate our findings. © 2014 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.},

abstract={The discovery of abundant natural gas resources has greatly increased the study of using methane as a feedstock to produce transportation fuels. Biogas (primarily containing methane and CO2), which is generated from waste biomass via anaerobic digestion or landfills, is regarded as a renewable source of methane, and has the potential to achieve sustainable production of transportation fuels. Since biogas also contains a significant amount of impurities (e.g., H2S, NH3, and siloxane), a cleaning procedure is generally required prior to conversion to transportation fuels. Physical approaches, mainly compression and liquefaction, have been commercially applied to upgrade biogas to bio-compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied biogas (LBG). For chemical approaches, catalytic reforming is the dominant method for converting methane to syngas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) or fermentation of syngas to a variety of alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, and butanol) and liquid hydrocarbon fuels (e.g., gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels). High purity hydrogen, a clean fuel, can also be produced via reforming. Methanol can be produced by direct oxidation of methane, while interest in the biological conversion of methane to methanol has grown recently due to its mild operating conditions, high conversion efficiency, and potential for using raw biogas. The derived methanol can be further converted to gasoline via a methanol to gasoline (MTG) process. This paper provides a comprehensive review of major research progress on technologies for converting biogas/methane into transportation fuels, and discusses the principles, kinetics, operating conditions, and performance of each technology. Efficient direct conversion of biogas into ethanol and higher alcohol fuels (e.g. butanol), which is envisaged to be the focus of research pursuits in the near future, is also discussed, with emphasis on the development of methane-utilizing microbes through genetic engineering. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The complement system has been implicated in obesity, fatty liver, diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Complement factors are produced in adipose tissue and appear to be involved in adipose tissue metabolism and local inflammation. Thereby complement links adipose tissue inflammation to systemic metabolic derangements, such as low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. Furthermore, complement has been implicated in pathophysiological mechanisms of diet- and alcohol induced liver damage, hyperglycaemia, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis and fibrinolysis.In this review, we summarize current evidence on the role of the complement system in several processes of human cardiometabolic disease. C3 is the central component in complement activation, and has most widely been studied in humans. C3 concentrations are associated with insulin resistance, liver dysfunction, risk of the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and CVD. C3 can be activated by the classical, the lectin and the alternative pathway of complement activation; and downstream activation of C3 activates the terminal pathway. Complement may also be activated via extrinsic proteases of the coagulation, fibrinolysis and the kinin systems. Studies on the different complement activation pathways in human cardiometabolic disease are limited, but available evidence suggests that they may have distinct roles in processes underlying cardiometabolic disease. The lectin pathway appeared beneficial in some studies on type 2 diabetes and CVD, while factors of the classical and the alternative pathway were related to unfavourable cardiometabolic traits. The terminal complement pathway was also implicated in insulin resistance and liver disease, and appears to have a prominent role in acute and advanced CVD.The available human data suggest a complex and potentially causal role for the complement system in human cardiometabolic disease. Further, preferably longitudinal studies are needed to disentangle which aspects of the complement system and complement activation affect the different processes in human cardiometabolic disease. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The hyphenated system was investigated with mixed standards and pooled urine samples to evaluate its precision, repeatability, linearity, sensitivity, and selectivity. The applied voltage, mobile phase, and gradient elution were optimized and applied for the analysis of urinary metabolites. Multivariate data analysis was subsequently performed and used to distinguish lung cancer patients from healthy controls successfully. High separation efficiency has been achieved in pCEC due to the EOF. For metabolite identification, the pCEC-MS separation mechnism was helpful for discriminating the fragment ions of glutamine conjugates from co-eluted metabolites. Three glutamine conjugates, including phenylacetylglutamine, acylglutamine C8:1, and acylglutamine C6:1 were identified among 16 differential urinary metabolites of lung cancer. Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis of acylglutamine C8:1 resulted in an area-under-curve value of 0.882. Overall, this work suggests that this pCEC-ESI-QTOF-MS method may provide a novel and useful platform for metabolomic studies due to its superior separation and identification. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are distributed ubiquitously in the aquatic environment, which raises concern for the flora and fauna in hydrosystems. The present critical review focuses on the fate and adverse effects of PFASs in the aquatic environment. The PFASs are continuously emitted into the environment from point and nonpoint sources such as sewage treatment plants and atmospheric deposition, respectively. Although concentrations of single substances may be too low to cause adverse effects, their mixtures can be of significant environmental concern. The production of C8-based PFASs (i.e., perfluorooctane sulfonate [PFOS] and perfluorooctanoate [PFOA]) is largely phased out; however, the emissions of other PFASs, in particular short-chain PFASs and PFAS precursors, are increasing. The PFAS precursors can finally degrade to persistent degradation products, which are, in particular, perfluoroalkane sulfonates (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs). In the environment, PFSAs and PFCAs are subject to partitioning processes, whereby short-chain PFSAs and PFCAs are mainly distributed in the water phase, whereas long-chain PFSAs and PFCAs tend to bind to particles and have a substantial bioaccumulation potential. However, there are fundamental knowledge gaps about the interactive toxicity of PFAS precursors and their persistent degradation products but also interactions with other natural and anthropogenic stressors. Moreover, because of the continuous emission of PFASs, further information about their ecotoxicological potential among multiple generations, species interactions, and mixture toxicity seems fundamental to reliably assess the risks for PFASs to affect ecosystem structure and function in the aquatic environment. © 2014 SETAC.},

abstract={Skin of color, also known as ethnic skin, is described as skin of individuals of African, Asian, Hispanic, Native-American, Middle Eastern, and Pacific Island backgrounds. Differences in hair morphology, hair grooming, cultural practices, and susceptibility to keloid scarring exist within these populations and have been implicated in hair, scalp, and skin disorders. Acne keloidalis (AK), central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA), dissecting cellulitis of the scalp (DCS), pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB), traction alopecia (TA), and keloids are the most prevalent follicular and scarring disorders in skin of color. They have been associated with disfigurement, permanent hair loss, emotional distress, and decreased quality of life. Hair grooming practices, such as the use of chemical relaxers, heat straightening, and tight braiding and weaving can cause scalp irritation and follicular damage and are linked to the pathogenesis of some of these conditions. Consequently, patient education and behavior modifications are integral to the prevention and management of these disorders. Scarring disorders are also of concern in ethnic populations. Keloid scarring is more prevalent in individuals of African, Asian, and Hispanic descent. The scarring alopecia CCCA is almost exclusively seen in patients of African descent. Therapeutic regimens such as intralesional corticosteroids, surgical excision, and laser therapy can be effective for these follicular and scarring disorders, but carry a risk of dyspigmentation and keloid scarring. Ethnic skin and hair may present unique challenges to the clinician, and knowledge of these differences is essential to providing quality care. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={Background Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a remnant of the fetal circulation present in 20% of the population. Right-to-left shunting (RLS) through a PFO has been linked to the pathophysiology of stroke, migraine with aura, and hypoxemia. While different imaging modalities including transcranial Doppler, intra-cardiac echo, and transthoracic echo (TTE) have often been used to detect RLS, transesophageal echo (TEE) bubble study remains the gold standard for diagnosing PFO. The aim of this study was to determine the relative accuracy of TEE in the detection of PFO. Methods and Results A systematic review of Medline, using a standard approach for meta-analysis, was performed for all prospective studies assessing accuracy of TEE in the detection of PFO using confirmation by autopsy, cardiac surgery, and/or catheterization as the reference. Search results revealed 3105 studies; 4 met inclusion criteria. A total of 164 patients were included. TEE had a weighted sensitivity of 89.2% (95% CI: 81.1-94.7%) and specificity of 91.4% (95% CI: 82.3-96.8%) to detect PFO. The overall positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was 5.93 (95% CI: 1.30-27.09) and the overall negative likelihood ratio (LR-) was 0.22 (95% CI: 0.08-0.56). Conclusion While TEE bubble study is considered to be the gold standard modality for diagnosing PFO, some PFOs may still be missed or misdiagnosed. It is important to understand the limitations of TEE and perhaps use other highly sensitive screening tests, such as transcranial doppler (TCD), in conjunction with TEE before scheduling a patient for transcatheter PFO closure. © 2013, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) is an extraction and clean-up technique originally developed for recovering pesticide residues from fruits and vegetables. Since its introduction, and until December 2013, about 700 papers have been published using the QuEChERS technique, according to a literature overview carried out using SciFinder, Elsevier SciVerse, and Google search engines. Most of these papers were dedicated to pesticide multiresidue analysis in food matrices, and this topic has been thoroughly reviewed over recent years. The QuEChERS approach is now rapidly developing beyond its original field of application to analytes other than pesticides, and matrices other than food, such as biological fluids and non-edible plants, including Chinese medicinal plants. Recently, the QuEChERS concept has spread to environmental applications by analyzing not only pesticides but also other compounds of environmental concern in soil, sediments, and water. To the best of our knowledge, QuEChERS environmental applications have not been reviewed so far; therefore, in this contribution, after a general discussion on the evolution and changes of the original QuEChERS method, a critical survey of the literature regarding environmental applications of conventional and modified QuEChERS methodology is provided. The overall recoveries obtained with QuEChERS and other extraction approaches (e.g., accelerated solvent extraction, ultrasonic solvent extraction, liquid/solid extraction, and soxhlet extraction) were compared, providing evidence for QuEChERS higher recoveries for various classes of compounds, such as biopesticides, chloroalkanes, phenols, and perfluoroalkyl substances. The role of physicochemical properties of soil (i.e., clay and organic carbon content, as well as cation exchange capacity) and target analytes (i.e., log KOW, water solubility, and vapor pressure) were also evaluated in order to interpret recovery and matrix effect data. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Alongside history, human activities have contributed to the deployment of environmental quality. In particular, during the last decades the problem of water preservation has gained increasing attention. Statistical analysis is essential to analyze environmental data and to identify trends of pollutants over space and time. Usually applied techniques for data treatment are based on the organization of data in a two-way array, missing some shades on pollutants distribution. This fact supports the use of multi-way techniques, which allow the analysis of the results through different directions at the same time. For Three Modes Principal Components Analysis (3MPCA) a principal components analysis is conducted using three modes and a "core" matrix that allows assessing their interactions. In the case of environmental studies, it offers information about the spatial-temporal evolution of pollutants in a certain water body. The Guadalquivir River estuary has been used as a model system. It is a representative human influenced system, where different pollution inputs have been characterized. In this study, decadal evolution of pollutants has been discussed, to evaluate among others the effects of EU legislation on river water quality. The aim of this work is the establishment of the evolution, during the last decade, of nutrients and metals ultra-traces distribution in an estuary affected by anthropic activities. As examples, Pb and PO43- show a trend to decrease their weight on water pollution, total suspended solids (TSS) behavior is related with massive rain events, and the rising of new technologies appears as a source of emerging pollutants as Co in urban-industrial areas. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The contents of heavy metals in the 3 types of tea were in the order of black tea > Oolong tea > green tea. Both PFOS and PFOA contents were low and PFOA content was higher than PFOS in the tea samples. The highest concentration of PFOA was 0.25 ng/g dry weight found in a Hunan green tea. The Principal component analysis was performed with the trace metals and PFCs to analyze the relationships of these indices. The results showed that black teas had higher trace metals and PFCs than green and Oolong teas, and the teas from Hunan and Zhejiang provinces had higher Pb and Cr than others. © 2014 Institute of Food Technologists®.},

Experimental studies have shown that amongst others polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-153 and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) may have obesogenic effects in prenatally exposed mice. Objective: To provide an overview of five classes of chemicals which have frequently been indicated as potential obesogens, and to discuss the evidence available regarding early life exposure to these compounds and overweight later in life. Methods: Pubmed was systematically searched for publications which related early life exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) to growth parameters later in life. We included 19 studies, which were published from 1995 and onwards. Results: Both positive and negative associations are observed between early life exposure and weight or height at various ages, including as early as 14. months, as well as until 20. years of age. In none of the included studies negative associations between perinatal exposure to EDCs and body mass index (BMI) were found and in several studies a positive association was observed. Dose-response relations appear to be non-monotonic. Conclusion: For certain EDCs, early life exposure may be associated with weight homeostasis later in life, however not necessarily in an obesogenic direction. More sensitive measures of adiposity as well as long-term follow-up are warranted for future studies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In addition, this review aims to familiarize vitreoretinal surgeons with specifications of currently available Food and Drug Administration-approved presbyopia-correcting intraocular lenses. METHODS:: Review of current literature performed with PubMed for search terms "presbyopia," "correction," "IOL," "vitreoretinal," "challenges," and "surgical" both singly and in combination as well as closely related terms. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION:: Specific intraoperative issues with presbyopia-correcting intraocular lenses that may be encountered include peripheral visualization, condensation, lens material issues particularly with silicone oil, decentration, Z-syndrome, and foveal image displacement. Every patient undergoing retinal surgery should also be asked about previous laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis/photorefractive keratectomy because those eyes require special attention to surface hydration and care to avoid epithelial removal if possible. Intracorneal ring segments and corneal inlays can cause effects similar to those of a small pupil. However, these can be managed with thorough preoperative evaluation and various intraoperative maneuvers. In addition, retinal physicians should be aware that macular disorders, such as age-related macular degeneration, may be exacerbated by potential loss of contrast sensitivity.© Ophthalmic Communication society,Inc.},

Considerable validation of this technology has been performed at both the bench-scale and pilot-scale, which has been facilitated by the development of stable electrode materials that efficiently generate high yields of hydroxyl radicals (OH) (e.g., boron-doped diamond (BDD), doped-SnO 2, PbO2, and substoichiometic- and doped-TiO2). Although a promising new technology, the mechanisms involved in the oxidation of organic compounds during EAOPs and the corresponding environmental impacts of their use have not been fully addressed. In order to unify the state of knowledge, identify research gaps, and stimulate new research in these areas, this review critically analyses published research pertaining to EAOPs. Specific topics covered in this review include (1) EAOP electrode types, (2) oxidation pathways of select classes of contaminants, (3) rate limitations in applied settings, and (4) long-term sustainability. Key challenges facing EAOP technologies are related to toxic byproduct formation (e.g., ClO 4- and halogenated organic compounds) and low electro-active surface areas. These challenges must be addressed in future research in order for EAOPs to realize their full potential for water treatment. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.},

This article systematically and critically reviews the epidemiologic evidence regarding the association between PFOA and PFOS exposure and cancer risk in humans. Eighteen epidemiologic studies-eight of PFOA, four of PFOS, and six of both PFOA and PFOS-have estimated associations of exposure to these chemicals with cancer incidence or mortality, with studies equally divided between occupational and nonoccupational settings. Although some statistically significant positive associations have been reported, for example, with cancers of the prostate, kidney, testis, and thyroid, the majority of relative risk estimates for both PFOA and PFOS have been between 0.5 and 2.0 (with 95% confidence intervals including 1.0), inconsistently detected across studies, counterbalanced by negative associations, not indicative of a monotonic exposure-response relationship, and not coherent with toxicological evidence in animals, in which the primary target organs are the liver, testis (Leydig cells), and pancreas (acinar cells). Many positive associations with PFOA exposure were detected in community settings without occupational exposure and were not supported by results in exposed workers. Given that occupational exposure to PFOA and PFOS is one to two orders of magnitude higher than environmental exposure, the discrepant positive findings are likely due to chance, confounding, and/or bias. Taken together, the epidemiologic evidence does not support the hypothesis of a causal association between PFOA or PFOS exposure and cancer in humans. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

As these residual fatty acids can cause further air and water pollution, a new Myroides isolate ZB35 from activated sludge was explored to degrade these C5-C8 fatty acids in this study. It was found that the biodegradation process involved a lag phase that became prolonged with increasing acyl chain length when the fatty acids were individually fed to this strain. However, when fed as a mixture, the ones with longer acyl chains were found to become more quickly assimilated. The branched 2-methylbutanoic acid was always the last one to be depleted among the five fatty acids under both conditions. Metabolite analysis revealed one possible origin of short chain fatty acids in the biologically treated wastewater. Aroma volatiles including 2-methylbutyl isovalerate, isoamyl 2-methylbutanoate, isoamyl isovalerate, and 2-methylbutyl 2-methylbutanoate were subsequently identified from ZB35 extracts, linking the source of the fruity odor to these esters excreted by Myroides species. To our best knowledge, this is the first finding of these aroma esters in bacteria. From a biotechnological viewpoint, this study has revealed the potential of Myroides species as a promising source of aroma esters attractive for food and fragrance industries. © 2014 The Microbiological Society of Korea and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Fluorine is the world's 13th most abundant element and constitutes 0.08% of the Earth crust. It has the highest electronegativity of all elements. Fluoride is widely distributed in the environment, occurring in the air, soils, rocks, and water. Although fluoride is used industrially in a fluorine compound, the manufacture of ceramics, pesticides, aerosol propellants, refrigerants, glassware, and Teflon cookware, it is a generally unwanted byproduct of aluminium, fertilizer, and iron ore manufacture. The medicinal use of fluorides for the prevention of dental caries began in January 1945 when community water supplies in Grand Rapids, United States, were fluoridated to a level of 1 ppm as a dental caries prevention measure. However, water fluoridation remains a controversial public health measure. This paper reviews the human health effects of fluoride. The authors conclude that available evidence suggests that fluoride has a potential to cause major adverse human health problems, while having only a modest dental caries prevention effect. As part of efforts to reduce hazardous fluoride ingestion, the practice of artificial water fluoridation should be reconsidered globally, while industrial safety measures need to be tightened in order to reduce unethical discharge of fluoride compounds into the environment. Public health approaches for global dental caries reduction that do not involve systemic ingestion of fluoride are urgently needed. © 2014 Stephen Peckham and Niyi Awofeso.},

Linear regression analysis data for the calibration plot showed there was a good linear relationship between response and concentration for nevirapine and the oxidative metabolites with regression coefficient value, r2 were &gt; 0.99. The method was validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. In this paper, we used UV detection for the simultaneous detection of nevirapine and two of its major oxidative metabolites and the results were satisfactory. UV detection is simple and available to most analytical laboratories. In addition, this method involves a simple liquid-liquid extraction with good reproducibility, which makes it suitable for pharmaco - kinetic study.},

It has been evidenced that fuel cells assembled with SSC-PFSA possess higher and more stable performance at elevated temperature up to 130 °C compared to that of fuel cells based on conventional long-side-chain (LSC) PFSA (Nafion®) membranes. Moreover, the shorter side-pendent chains and the absence of the ether group and of the tertiary carbon also endow SSC-PFSAs with better durability, making them more suitable for working at harsh conditions in fuel cell systems. This critical review is dedicated to summarizing the properties of SSC-PFSA and providing insight into an understanding of their micro-morphologies, mass diffusion, enhanced proton transportation and their mutual correlation. Diversified measurement techniques applied to investigate the evolution of micro-morphologies, unique diffusion and transportation properties of SSC-PFSAs are reviewed. Despite the higher crystalline and higher water absorption of SSC-PFSAs than those of LSC-PFSAs, the notably less developed and less interconnected ionic clusters in SSC-PFSAs lead to lower mass permeability, and hence the high water uptake is not as well translated into transportation performance as expected. The factors and reasons for the enhanced electrochemical performance of SSC-PFSAs such as higher proton conductivity at elevated temperatures and low humidity conditions are also discussed and understood. Highlights of recent advances in SSC-PFSA-based membranes for fuel cell applications at wider temperature ranges are summarized as general references for researchers to further prompt the development of SSC-PFSAs. The SSC-PFSAs based membranes give a bright future for the next generation of high-temperature PEMFCs. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={This is the 29th annual review of the application of atomic spectrometry to the chemical analysis of environmental samples. This Update refers to papers published approximately between September 2012 and July 2013 and continues the series of Atomic Spectrometry Updates (ASUs) in Environmental Analysis 1 that should be read in conjunction with other related ASUs in the series namely: clinical and biological materials, foods and beverages; 2 advances in atomic spectrometry and related techniques;3 elemental speciation;3 X-ray spectrometry4 and advances in the analysis of metals, chemicals and materials.5 In the field of air analysis, highlights within this review period include measuring the bioaccessible fraction of metals in particles and ongoing work in assessing the performance of optical and combustion techniques for the determination of the carbonaceous content of airborne particulate matter. Developments in instrumentation included new sampler designs for the collection of nanoparticles, the coupling of FFF and hydrodynamic chromatography to ICP-MS for the sizing and compositional analysis of such particles and the ongoing development of aerosol mass spectrometry. In the field of water analysis, new procedures for the detection and quantification of emerging pollutants in water such as MRI contrast agents have been developed. Instrumental developments reported include the use of molecular absorption spectrometry, by exploiting the CS-AAS technique, for measuring halogen species in water. Numerous articles involving the application of atomic spectrometry to plants, soils and related materials appeared in this review period but, as usual, most were concerned with the environmental significance of the results, rather than the methodology used to obtain them. Nevertheless, there have been some interesting developments. Both LIBS and PXRF spectrometry have been used more widely, variants such as LA-LIBS and microwave assisted LIBS have appeared, and PXRF spectrometry has been applied for the first time in the analysis of plants. Developments in geochemical analysis include the production and (re)certification of new geological RMs for bulk, isotopic and microspatial analysis. Optimisation of LA-ICP-MS techniques for the interrogation of geochemical samples continues to be reported and a number of useful instrumental review articles (AMS, ICP-MS and SIMS) have been published.

The prevalence of PFO in patients younger than 55 years who have a cryptogenic stroke is approximately 55%. The association of PFO with cryptogenic stroke has been confirmed in meta-analyses. For secondary prevention of cryptogenic stroke, closure of the PFO or medical treatment are recommended. Previous meta-analyses of observational studies have suggested significant benefit of transcathether PFO closure in comparison with medical therapy. The results of the randomized trials comparing percutaneous closure of the PFO with medical treatment in patients with cryptogenic embolism were published in 2012 and 2013. All three trials have failed to show benefits associated with the PFO closure in patients with a cryptogenic stroke. The most effective strategy for secondary prevention of cryptogenic embolism in patients with PFOs is still uncertain. Copyright © 2013 Cornetis.},

abstract={Background: Metabolic profiles have been shown to be associated to obesity status and insulin sensitivity. Dietary intakes influence metabolic pathways and therefore, different dietary patterns may relate to modifications in metabolic signatures. The objective was to verify associations between dietary patterns and metabolic profiles composed of amino acids (AAs) and acylcarnitines (ACs). Methods. 210 participants were recruited in the greater Quebec City area between September 2009 and December 2011. Dietary patterns had been previously derived using principal component analysis (PCA). The Prudent dietary pattern was characterised by higher intakes of vegetables, fruits, whole grain products, non-hydrogenated fat and lower intakes of refined grain products, whereas the Western dietary pattern was associated with higher intakes of refined grain products, desserts, sweets and processed meats. Targeted metabolites were quantified in 37 participants with the Biocrates Absolute IDQ p150 (Biocrates Life Sciences AG, Austria) mass spectrometry method (including 14 amino acids and 41 acylcarnitines). Results: PCA analysis with metabolites including AAs and ACs revealed two main components explaining the most variance in overall data (13.8%). PC1 was composed mostly of medium- to long-chain ACs (C16:2, C14:2, C14:2-OH, C16, C14:1-OH, C14:1, C10:2, C5-DC/C6-OH, C12, C18:2, C10, C4:1-DC/C6, C8:1 and C2) whereas PC2 included certain AAs and short-chain ACs (xLeu, Met, Arg, Phe, Pro, Orn, His, C0, C3, C4 and C5). The Western dietary pattern correlated negatively with PC1 and positively with PC2 (r = -0.34, p = 0.05 and r = 0.38, p = 0.03, respectively), independently of age, sex and BMI. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the Western dietary pattern is associated with a specific metabolite signature characterized by increased levels of AAs including branched-chain AAs (BCAAs) and short-chain ACs.

abstract={In order to compare between in vivo toxicity studies, dosimetry is needed to translate study-specific dose regimens into dose metrics such as tissue concentration. These tissue concentrations may then be compared with in vitro bioactivity assays to perhaps identify mechanisms relevant to the lowest observed effect level (LOEL) dose group and the onset of the observed in vivo toxicity. Here, we examine the perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS). We analyzed 9 in vivo toxicity studies for PFOA and 13 in vivo toxicity studies for PFOS. Both PFCs caused multiple effects in various test species, strains, and genders. We used a Bayesian pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling framework to incorporate data from 6 PFOA PK studies and 2 PFOS PK studies (conducted in 3 species) to predict dose metrics for the in vivo LOELs and no observed effect levels (NOELs). We estimated PK parameters for 11 combinations of chemical, species, strain, and gender. Despite divergent study designs and species-specific PK, for a given effect, we found that the predicted dose metrics corresponding to the LOELs (and NOELs where available) occur at similar concentrations. In vitro assay results for PFOA and PFOS from EPA's ToxCast project were then examined. We found that most in vitro bioactivity occurs at concentrations lower than the predicted concentrations for the in vivo LOELs and higher than the predicted concentrations for the in vivo NOELs (where available), for a variety of nonimmunological effects. These results indicate that given sufficient PK data, the in vivo LOELs dose regimens, but not necessarily the effects, could have been predicted from in vitro studies for these 2 PFCs. © The Author 2013.

abstract={The divisome and elongasome are bacterial protein complexes responsible for peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis during cell division and elongation, respectively. We review several lines of evidence, arguing for a shared evolutionary past of the divisome and elongasome. Both integrate closely related penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) for PG synthesis, use proteins of the RodA/FtsW (SEDS, shape, elongation, division and sporulation) family for Lipid II export and interact with MraY/Mur proteins for Lipid II synthesis. It was recently shown that the actin-like protein FtsA of the divisome polymerises on membranes, adding another parallel, since membrane-associated filaments of the bacterial actin MreB guide the elongasome. Given these similarities, it seems plausible to conclude that the elongasome is a modified version of the divisome, without the membrane-constricting FtsZ-ring and its associated machinery on the inside. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is one of the most representative perfluorinated compounds and liver is the major organ where PFOA is accumulated. Although the multiple toxicities had been reported, its toxicological profile remained unclear. In this study, a systems toxicology strategy integrating liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based metabonomics and transcriptomics analyses was applied for the first time to investigate the effects of PFOA on a representative Chinese normal human liver cell line L-02, with focusing on the metabolic disturbance. Fifteen potential biomarkers were identified on metabolic level and most observations were consistent with the altered levels of gene expression. Our results showed that PFOA induced the perturbations in various metabolic processes in L-02 cells, especially lipid metabolism-related pathways. The up-stream mitochondrial carnitine metabolism was proved to be influenced by PFOA treatment. The specific transformation from carnitine to acylcarnitines, which showed a dose-dependent effect, and the expression level of key genes involved in this pathway were observed to be altered correspondingly. Furthermore, the down-stream cholesterol biosynthesis was directly confirmed to be up-regulated by both increased cholesterol content and elevated expression level of key genes. The PFOA-induced lipid metabolism-related effects in L-02 cells started from the fatty acid catabolism in cytosol, fluctuated to the processes in mitochondria, extended to the cholesterol biosynthesis. Many other metabolic pathways like amino acid metabolism and tricarboxylic acid cycle might also be disturbed. The findings obtained from the systems biological research provide more details about metabolic disorders induced by PFOA in human liver. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Because there is no endogenous F-19 signal, F-19 MRI is much more suited for quantification and tracking than H-1 MRI. However, F-19 MRI is not in clinical use because in spite of more than three decades of research, there are no approved F-19 imaging agents. New approaches and new methodologies are needed to move the field forward. Water-soluble fluorinated dendrimers present a promising alternative to conventional perfluorocarbon emulsions. This article outlines recent development of fluorinated dendrimers as F-19 imaging agents. This is notmeant to be a comprehensive review of F-19 imaging agents, for which there is an excellent recent review by Knight et al.

abstract={The presence in waste of emerging pollutants (EPs), whose behaviours and effects are not well understood, may present unexpected health and environmental risks and risks for the treatment processes themselves. EP may include substances that are newly detected in the environment, substances already identified as risky and whose use in items is prohibited (but which may be present in old or imported product waste) or substances already known but whose recent use in products can cause problems during their future treatment as waste. Several scientific studies have been conducted to assess the presence of EP in waste, but they are mostly dedicated to a single category of substance or one particular waste treatment. In the absence of a comprehensive review focused on the impact of the presence of EP on waste treatment schemes, the authors present a review of the key issues associated with the treatment of waste containing emerging pollutants. This review presents the typologies of emerging pollutants that are potentially present in waste along with the major challenges for each treatment scheme (recycling, composting, digestion, incineration, landfilling and wastewater treatment). All conventional treatment processes are affected by these new pollutants, and they were almost never originally designed to consider these substances. In addition to these general aspects, a comprehensive review of available data, projects and future R&D needs related to the impact of nanoparticles on waste treatment is presented as a case study. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The halide series (Cl-I) was synthesized by use of TMSBr and TMSI to give VBr(PMe3)(2)((NBu)-Bu-t)(2) 7 and VI(PMe3)(2)((NBu)-Bu-t)(2) 8. The phenyl derivative was obtained by reaction of 3 with MgPh2 to give VPh(PMe3)(2)((NBu)-Bu-t)(2) 9. These neutral complexes are compared to the previously reported cationic bisimides [V(PMe3)(3)((NBu)-Bu-t)(2)][Al(PFTB)(4)] 10, [V(PEt3)(2)((NBu)-Bu-t)(2)][Al(PFTB)(4)] 11, and [V(DMAP)(PEt3)(2)((NBu)-Bu-t)(2)][Al(PFTB)(4)] 12 (DMAP = dimethylaminopyridine, PFTB = perfluoro-tert-butoxide). Characterization of the complexes by X-ray diffraction, C-13 NMR, V-51 NMR, and V L-3,L-2-edge X-ray absorption nearedge structure (XANES) spectroscopy provides a description of the electronic structure in comparison to group 6 bisimides and the bent metallocene analogues. The electronic structure is dominated by pi bonding to the imides, and localization of electron density at the nitrogen atoms of the imides is dictated by the cone angle and donating ability of the axial neutral supporting ligands. This phenomenon is clearly seen in the sensitivity of V-51 NMR shift, C-13 NMR Delta delta(alpha beta), and L-3-edge energy to the nature of the supporting phosphine ligand, which defines the parameters for designing cationic group 5 bisimides that would be capable of breaking stronger sigma bonds. Conversely, all three methods show little dependence on the variable equatorial halide ligand. Furthermore, this analysis allows for quantification of the electronic differences between vanadium bisimides and the structurally analogous mixed Cp/imide system CpV((NBu)-Bu-t)X-2 (Cp = C5H51-).},

abstract={Traces of prebiotic amino acids, i.e., the building blocks of proteins, are excellent biomarkers that could provide evidence of extinct or extant life in extra-terrestrial environments. In particular, characterization of the enantiomeric excess of amino acids gives relevant information about the biotic or abiotic origin of molecules, because it is generally assumed that life elsewhere could be based on either l or d amino acids, but not both. The analytical procedures used in in-situ space missions for chiral discrimination of amino acids must meet severe requirements imposed by flight conditions: short analysis time, low energy consumption, robustness, storage for long periods under extreme conditions, high efficiency and sensitivity, automation, and remote-control operation. Such methods are based on gas chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography, and capillary electrophoresis, usually coupled with mass spectrometry; of these, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is the only such combination yet used in space missions. Preliminary in-situ sample derivatization is required before GC-MS analysis to convert amino acids into volatile and thermally stable compounds. The silylation reagent most commonly used, N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide, is unsuitable for detection of homochirality, and alternative derivatization techniques have been developed that preserve the stereochemical configuration of the original compounds and are compatible with spaceflight conditions. These include the reagent N,N-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal, which has already been used in the Rosetta mission, a mixture of alkyl chloroformate, ethanol, and pyridine, a mixture of perfluorinated anhydrides and perfluoro alcohols, and hexafluoroacetone, the first gaseous derivatizing agent. In all the space instruments, solvent extraction of organic matter and chemical derivatization have been combined in a single automatic and remote-controlled procedure in a chemical reactor. Liquid-based separation systems have been used in space missions. In particular, microchip capillary electrophoresis, based on microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems, enables high-performance chemical analysis of amino acids with low mass and volume equipment and low power and reagent consumption. Coupling with laser-induced fluorescence detectors results in ultra-low limits of detection. This critical review describes applications of the on-board instruments used in the Rosetta mission to comets and in the more recent Mars exploration program, i.e., the Mars Science Laboratory and ExoMars missions.

abstract={The Yangtze River has been a source of life and prosperity for the Chinese people for centuries and is a habitat for a remarkable variety of aquatic species. But the river suffers from huge amounts of urban sewage, agricultural effluents, and industrial wastewater as well as ship navigation wastes along its course. With respect to the vast amounts of water and sediments discharged by the Yangtze River, it is reasonable to ask whether the pollution problem may be solved by simple dilution. This article reviews the past two decades of published research on organic pollutants in the Yangtze River and several adjacent water bodies connected to the main stream, according to a holistic approach. Organic pollutant levels and potential effects of water and sediments on wildlife and humans, measured in vitro, in vivo, and in situ, were critically reviewed. The contamination with organic pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and others, of water and sediment along the river was described. Especially Wuhan section and the Yangtze Estuary exhibited stronger pollution than other sections. Bioassays, displaying predominantly the endpoints mutagenicity and endocrine disruption, applied at sediments, drinking water, and surface water indicated a potential health risk in several areas. Aquatic organisms exhibited detectable concentrations of toxic compounds like PCBs, OCPs, PBDEs, and PFCs. Genotoxic effects could also be assessed in situ in fish. To summarize, it can be stated that dilution reduces the ecotoxicological risk in the Yangtze River, but does not eliminate it. Keeping in mind an approximately 14 times greater water discharge compared to the major European river Rhine, the absolute pollution mass transfer of the Yangtze River is of severe concern for the environmental quality of its estuary and the East China Sea. Based on the review, further research needs have been identified. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Computational meta-analysis can link environmental chemicals to genes and proteins involved in human diseases, thereby elucidating possible etiologies and pathogeneses of non-communicable diseases. We used an integrated computational systems biology approach to examine possible pathogenetic linkages in type 2 diabetes (T2D) through genome-wide associations, disease similarities, and published empirical evidence. Ten environmental chemicals were found to be potentially linked to T2D, the highest scores were observed for arsenic, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, hexachlorobenzene, and perfluorooctanoic acid. For these substances we integrated disease and pathway annotations on top of protein interactions to reveal possible pathogenetic pathways that deserve empirical testing. The approach is general and can address other public health concerns in addition to identifying diabetogenic chemicals, and offers thus promising guidance for future research in regard to the etiology and pathogenesis of complex diseases.},

abstract={Illicit drugs and their metabolites are the latest group of emerging pollutants. Determination of their concentration in environment (such as water bodies, soil, sediment, air) is an indirect tool to estimate the community level consumption of illicit drug and to evaluate potential ecotoxicological impacts from chronic low level exposure. They enter the wastewater network as unaltered drugs and/or their active metabolites by human excretion after illegal consumption or by accidental or deliberate disposal from clandestine drug laboratories. This article critically reviews the occurrence and concentration levels of illicit drugs and their metabolites in different environmental compartments (e.g., wastewater, surface waters, groundwater, drinking water, and ambient air) and their potential impact on the ecosystem. There is limited published information available on the presence of illicit drugs in the environment, reports are available mainly from European countries, UK, USA, and Canada but there is a lack of information from the remainder of the world. Although the environmental concentrations are not very high, they can potentially impact the human health and ecosystem functioning. Cocaine, morphine, amphetamine, and MDMA have potent pharmacological activities and their presence as complex mixtures in water may cause adverse effect on aquatic organisms and human health. However, there is no current regulation demanding the determination of occurrence of these emerging pollutants in treated wastewater, surface water, drinking water, or atmosphere. Thus, critical investigation on distribution pattern of this new group of emerging contaminant and their potential harmful impact on our environment needs immediate attention. © 2012 .},

abstract={The contemporary food supply chain (FSC) should adequately provide information that consumers and other concerned bodies need to know such as variety of the food attributes, country of origin, animal welfare, and genetic engineering related issues. For this, effective food traceability system (FTS) is important. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive literature review on food traceability issues. About 74 studies, mainly focusing on food traceability issues and published during 2000-2013, were reviewed. Based on the review results, the definition, driving forces, barriers in developing and implementing FTSs, benefits, traceability technologies, improvements, and performances of FTSs have been identified and discussed. Considering FTS as an integral part of logistics management, new conceptual definition of FTS has been provided. This review has pointed out that the issue of developing effective and full chain FTS is quite complex in nature as it requires a deeper understanding of real processes from different perspectives such as economic, legal, technological, and social issues. Therefore, future researches (recommended here) on traceability should focus on: integration of traceability activities with food logistics activities; technological aspects of FTSs; the linkage between traceability system and food production units; standardization of data capturing and information exchange; awareness creation strategies; continuity of information flow and effective communication of traceability information to consumers and other stakeholders; the linkage between different drivers of FTS; improvement strategies of FTS; and development of performance evaluation frameworks for FTSs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This comprehensive article summarizes our recent efforts to design functional star polymers via living radical polymerization as functional nanospaces for catalysis and molecular recognition. Metal-bearing star polymer catalysts are efficiently obtained from the ruthenium-mediated linking reaction of arm polymers in the presence of a ligand monomer. Star polymer catalysts (nanoreactors) were effective for oxidation of sec-alcohols, (asymmetric) hydrogenation of ketones, and living radical polymerization, performing activity, stability, functionality-tolerance, and practicability (catalyst recycle, easy product recovery) higher than conventional polymer catalysts and analogues of in-core metal complexes. Core-functionalized star polymer nanocapsules selectively capture and stimuli-responsively release functional molecules. The key is to condense functional groups such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), perfluoroalkane, and quaternary ammonium groups into the cores. Single-chain star polymers are created as a new class of star polymers via the self-folding of amphiphilic random copolymers with intramolecular hydrophobic interaction in water.},

Albendazole was selected as a model drug because of its anthelmintics properties and recent potential for cancer treatment. The development of two fully automated achiral-chiral and chiral-chiral high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods for the determination of albendazole (ABZ) and its metabolites albendazole sulphoxide (ABZ-SO), albendazole sulphone (ABZ-SO2) and albendazole 2-aminosulphone (ABZ-SO2NH2) in microsomal fractions are described. These methods involve the use of a phenyl (RAM-phenyl-BSA) or octyl (RAM-C8-BSA) restricted access media bovine serum albumin column for the sample clean-up, followed by an achiral phenyl column (15.0×0.46cmI.D.) or a chiral amylose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) column (15.0×0.46cmI.D.). The chiral 2D HPLC method was applied to the development of a compromise condition for the in vitro metabolism of ABZ by means of experimental design involving multivariate analysis. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Methods: All of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on FTS for colorectal surgery were analyzed with the Cochrane systematic review. Database retrievals of Medline, Embase and Cochrane was were conducted, together with two published FTS meta-analyses. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the studies, extracted the relevant data and performed a cross-check. A metaanalysis was performed with RevMan 5 software. Results: A total of 15 studies were reviewed in this study, including 13 articles in English and 2 articles in Chinese, of which 7 were RCTs and 8 were CCTs. The overall rates of morbidity and readmission in the FTS group were lower compared to patients who underwent the conventional treatments (conventional treatment group or control group) in the RCTs but tended to increase in the CCTs. There were no statistically significant differences between the FTS group and the control group regarding ileus, anastomotic leakage, abdominal distention, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention and infection of the incisional wound. Conclusion: The overall rates of morbidity and readmission in the FTS group were similar or even lower compared to the control group in RCTs, with an increasing trend in the CCTs. Further discussion is needed as to why the results of the RCTs were not repeated in the CCTs, especially with regard to the causes of readmission. It should also be determined whether an early discharge might cause a delay in the diagnosis of some complications, and thereby the occurrence of serious complications. If a number of severe complications occurred due to an early discharge, the value of FTS would be in question. © 2012 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Background: Diabetes is a major threat to public health in the United States and worldwide. Understanding the role of environmental chemicals in the development or progression of diabetes is an emerging issue in environmental health. Objective: We assessed the epidemiologic literature for evidence of associations between persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and type 2 diabetes. Methods: Using a PubMed search and reference lists from relevant studies or review articles, we identified 72 epidemiological studies that investigated associations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) with diabetes. We evaluated these studies for consistency, strengths and weaknesses of study design (including power and statistical methods), clinical diagnosis, exposure assessment, study population characteristics, and identification of data gaps and areas for future research. Conclusions: Heterogeneity of the studies precluded conducting a meta-analysis, but the overall evidence is sufficient for a positive association of some organochlorine POPs with type 2 diabetes. Collectively, these data are not sufficient to establish causality. Initial data mining revealed that the strongest positive correlation of diabetes with POPs occurred with organochlorine compounds, such as trans-nonachlor, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dioxins and dioxin-like chemicals. There is less indication of an association between other nonorganochlorine POPs, such as perfluoroalkyl acids and brominated compounds, and type 2 diabetes. Experimental data are needed to confirm the causality of these POPs, which will shed new light on the pathogenesis of diabetes. This new information should be considered by governmental bodies involved in the regulation of environmental contaminants.},

abstract={In the mid-1970s, it was recognized that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were strong greenhouse gases that could have substantial impacts on radiative forcing of climate change, as well as being substances that deplete stratospheric ozone. Around a decade later, this group of radiatively active compounds was expanded to include a large number of replacements for ozone-depleting substances such as chlorocarbons, hydrochlorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), bromofluorocarbons, and bromochlorofluorocarbons. This paper systematically reviews the published literature concerning the radiative efficiencies (REs) of CFCs, bromofluorocarbons and bromochlorofluorocarbons (halons), HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs, sulfur hexafluoride, nitrogen trifluoride, and related halogen containing compounds. In addition, we provide a comprehensive and self-consistent set of new calculations of REs and global warming potentials (GWPs) for these compounds, mostly employing atmospheric lifetimes taken from the available literature. We also present global temperature change potentials for selected gases. Infrared absorption spectra used in the RE calculations were taken from databases and individual studies and from experimental and ab initio computational studies. Evaluations of REs and GWPs are presented for more than 200 compounds. Our calculations yield REs significantly (> 5%) different from those in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for 49 compounds. We present new RE values for more than 100 gases which were not included in AR4. A widely used simple method to calculate REs and GWPs from absorption spectra and atmospheric lifetimes is assessed and updated. This is the most comprehensive review of the radiative efficiencies and global warming potentials of halogenated compounds performed to date. Key Points We review REs of CFCs,Bromocarbons and halons, HCFCs,HFCs,PFCs, SF6,NF3. We present calculations of REs and GWPs for these compounds. We present Global Temperature change Potentials (GTPs) for selected gases. © 2013. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

The objective of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of PFNA and DHS for pertrochanteric fractures. Hypothesis: PFNA achieves better efficacy for peritrochanteric fractures compared with DHS. Materials and methods: Relevant randomized controlled trials comparing PFNA with DHS for pertrochanteric fractures were assessed for eligibility and included into this meta-analysis. Data were extracted independently and methodological quality was further assessed. The inclusion criteria of this meta-analysis were: randomized controlled trials comparing PFNA with DHS for pertrochanteric fractures and reporting at least one of these main outcomes, including operating time, blood loss, all causes mortality, and complications. Results: Five randomized controlled trials were finally included into this meta-analysis. Pooled results showed there were less blood loss (weighted mean difference Blood loss = -249.75. ml, 95%CI -303.83 to -195.67, P<0.0001) and fewer complications (Odds ratio = 0.40, 95%CI 0.23 to 0.70, P=0.001) in the PFNA group compared with the DHS group. However, there was no difference in term of mortality between those two groups (Odds ratio mortality = 1.13, 95%CI 0.47 to 2.69, P=0.79). Sensitivity analysis by sequential omission of individual studies showed that the significance of pooled odds ratios was robust, which suggested this outcome was credible. Discussion: PFNA can benefit peritrochanteric fractures patients with less blood loss and fewer complications compared with DHS. The significant heterogeneity among the included trials for intraoperative blood loss, and operation time may be attributable to variation in the skills of the surgeons and the different types of perirochanteric fractures.

The supports and cobalt catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques; the metal content of the cobalt-based catalysts was analyzed by atomic absorption. The activity and selectivity of the CNFs supported catalysts were studied at 523 K, 20 bar and H2/CO = 2. Co/CNF-1 and Co/CNF-2 were very active and showed high selectivity to CH4 and CO2, without further deactivation, whereas the less active catalyst Co/CNF-3 led to the highest selectivity to long-chained hydrocarbons (C5+) and under was a remarkable deactivation. Used catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption- desorption, XRD and TGA. Results confirmed that all the catalysts underwent catalyst fouling as a consequence of C5+ hydrocarbons formation whereas catalyst Co/CNF-3 presented a notably metal sintering by coalescence. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={High fat diet (HFD) is closely linked to a variety of health issues including fatty liver. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a synthetic perfluorinated carboxylic acid, also causes liver injury. The present study investigated the possible interactions between high fat diet and PFOA in induction of liver injury. Mice were pair-fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or low fat control with or without PFOA administration at 5 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks. Exposure to PFOA alone caused elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and increased liver weight along with reduced body weight and adipose tissue mass. HFD alone did not cause liver damage, but exaggerated PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity as indicated by higher plasma ALT and AST levels, and more severe pathological changes including hepatocyte hypertrophy, lipid droplet accumulation and necrosis as well as inflammatory cell infiltration. These additive effects of HFD on PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity correlated with metabolic disturbance in liver and blood as well as up-regulation of hepatic proinflammatory cytokine genes. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that both serum and hepatic metabolite profiles of PFOA, HFD, or HFD-PFOA group were clearly differentiated from that of controls. PFOA affected more hepatic metabolites than HFD, but HFD showed positive interaction with PFOA on fatty acid metabolites including long chain fatty acids and acylcarnitines. Taken together, dietary high fat potentiates PFOA-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and necrotic cell death by disturbing hepatic metabolism and inducing inflammation. This study demonstrated, for the first time, that HFD increases the risk of PFOA in induction of hepatotoxicity. © 2013 Tan et al.},

abstract={Purpose: Several environmental toxicants (ETs), including dioxins and dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), perfluorochemicals, organochlorine pesticides, phthalates, and heavy metals (especially cadmium with its estrogen-like properties in animal models) have been investigated as possibly being related to endometriosis. Methods: Systematic review of pertinent literature. Results: DLCs have been the most investigated ETs. DLCs are persistent organic pollutants with highly toxic potential and include three types of compounds: polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) or furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The most toxic is 2, 3, 7, 8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The connection mechanism between dioxins and endometriosis is still unclear. However, dioxins and DLCs are endocrine-disrupting compounds that can affect the pathobiology of endometriosis at multiple levels. Part of the dioxin and DLCs toxic effects can be accounted for by their interaction with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). It has been proposed that dioxin can initiate or promote endometriosis by means of interaction with estrogen receptors or by suppressing the expression of progesterone receptors. Furthermore, TCDD alters the expression of cytokines and growth factors, remodeling enzymes and cytochrome P450 expression and activity. Conclusions: Studies in rhesus models have revealed a correlation between dioxin exposure and endometriosis. However, evidence from epidemiologic studies is inconclusive. © 2013 Wichtig Editore.},

With this dual goal in mind, thermodynamic and thermophysical properties of fluorinated ionic liquids (FILs) and their toxicity and biocompatibility are discussed so that the feasibility of the proposed applications can be evaluated. Herein, FILs are defined as ionic liquids with fluorinated chain lengths equal or greater than four carbon atoms. This paper provides a critical review of the experimental data for fluorinated ionic liquids available in the literature, and subsequently, with the aim of expanding knowledge of FILs, eight new fluorinated ionic liquids were selected for characterization. The attained results will clearly impact applications using polyfluorinated compounds. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The Fischer-Tropsch reaction was performed using a pilot-scale slurry bubble column reactor (SBCR) and a lab-scale continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). In contrast to the CSTR, a transitory induction period was observed in the SBCR. In this study, we investigated the catalyst performance during the induction period focusing on the hydrodynamic parameter changes inside the reactor. We measured the hydraulic pressure for the constant slurry thickness during FTS reaction. The FT wax product was regularly withdrawn using a metal filter and analyzed for density, oxygen concentration, and compositional analysis. The liquid density was affected by the dilution of the initial liquid media by fresh FT product for the whole reaction time of 180. h. On the other hand, the oxygen concentration increased sharply for the initial 85. h and then reached the steady state. Accordingly, the gas hold-up and CO conversion were enhanced for the same period. The increase in the gas hold-up could be explained by the coalescence inhibition effect of oxygenated compounds, which were the main byproducts when iron-based catalysts were used. The dynamic gas disengagement technique was employed to identify the coalescence inhibition effect of alcohol in the hydrocarbon system using a cylindrical acrylic bubble column. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose of Review: There is increasing evidence that the prenatal window represents a critical period in which the developing immune system may be primed toward an allergic phenotype. Studies have investigated the role of a number of maternal environmental exposures on subsequent allergic disorders in the offspring. We summarize findings from recent studies on prenatal environmental factors influencing IgE levels, atopy, and early asthma. Recent Findings: A building literature supports the influence of maternal exposure to environmental pollutants, such as allergens, traffic-related air pollution, tobacco smoke, and organochlorine compounds and social factors on allergic outcomes. More novel associations have been investigated, such as the effect of prenatal exposures to phthalates, bisphenol A, and magnetic fields. There is also rising interest in epigenetics as a pathway of action by which maternal exposure affect immune health. Summary: Emerging research highlights the challenges of investigating in-utero exposures and of relating exposures to such a heterogeneous and complex outcome as allergic disease. Further research is needed on the mechanisms by which prenatal exposure influences allergic response in childhood and how postnatal, familial and social factors, and sex can modify disease outcomes. Epigenetics is a promising new frontier, and likely one of several explanatory factors. Copyright © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={Cell-cell communication, or quorum sensing, is a widespread phenomenon in bacteria that is used to coordinate gene expression among local populations. Its use by bacterial pathogens to regulate genes that promote invasion, defense, and spread has been particularly well documented. With the ongoing emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, there is a current need for development of alternative therapeutic strategies. An antivirulence approach by which quorum sensing is impeded has caught on as a viable means to manipulate bacterial processes, especially pathogenic traits that are harmful to human and animal health and agricultural productivity. The identification and development of chemical compounds and enzymes that facilitate quorum-sensing inhibition (QSI) by targeting signaling molecules, signal biogen-esis, or signal detection are reviewed here. Overall, the evidence suggests that QSI therapy may be efficacious against some, but not necessarily all, bacterial pathogens, and several failures and ongoing concerns that may steer future studies in productive directions are discussed. Nevertheless, various QSI successes have rightfully perpetuated excitement surrounding new potential therapies, and this review highlights promising QSI leads in disrupting pathogenesis in both plants and animals.

The obtained complexes were characterized in the solid state and in the gaseous phase by electron impact mass spectrometry (EI MS), IR spectroscopy, and thermal analysis with the detection of evolved gases. In addition, during the recrystallization of the [Cu2( tBuNH2)2(μ-O2CC3F 7)4] complex the (tBuNH3) +(C3F7CO2)- ion pair was isolated, and its X-ray structure was determined. As a result of a mass spectra analysis, the presence of metallated species in the gaseous phase was revealed. Among the species detected, the pseudomolecular ions [Cu2( tBuNH2)2(μ-O2CR) 3]+ were found. The fact confirmed the dimeric structure of the studied complexes with bridging carboxylates and axially N-coordinated amines. TGA studies demonstrated that copper transfer to the gaseous phase occurs at atmospheric pressure, which suggests that the obtained compounds can be promising precursors for chemical vapor deposition. The selected Cu(II) compounds were used in the preliminary CVD experiments, and the conformal copper layers were formed with no additional reducing agents. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Preterm birth is a significant public health concern, as it is associated with high risk of infant mortality, various morbidities in both the neonatal period and later in life, and a significant societal economic burden. As many cases are of unknown etiology, identification of the contribution of environmental contaminant exposures is a priority in the study of preterm birth. This is a comprehensive review of all known studies published from 1992 through August 2012 linking maternal exposure to environmental chemicals during pregnancy with preterm birth. Using PubMed searches, studies were identified that examined associations between preterm birth and exposure to five categories of environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants, drinking-water contaminants, atmospheric pollutants, metals and metalloids, and other environmental contaminants. Individual studies were summarized and specific suggestions were made for future work in regard to exposure and outcome assessment methods as well as study design, with the recommendation of focusing on potential mediating toxicological mechanisms. In conclusion, no consistent evidence was found for positive associations between individual chemical exposures and preterm birth. By identifying limitations and addressing the gaps that may have impeded the ability to identify true associations thus far, this review can guide future epidemiologic studies of environmental exposures and preterm birth. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Background: A dipose tissue (AT) is involved in several physiological functions, including metabolic regulation, energy storage, and endocrine functions. Objectives: In this review we examined the evidence that an additional function of AT is to modulate persistent organic pollutant (POP) toxicity through several mechanisms. Methods: We reviewed the literature on the interaction of AT with POPs to provide a comprehensive model for this additional function of AT. discussion: As a storage compartment for lipophilic POPs, AT plays a critical role in the toxico-kinetics of a variety of drugs and pollutants, in particular, POPs. By sequestering POPs, AT can protect other organs and tissues from POPs overload. However, this protective function could prove to be a threat in the long run. Te accumulation of lipophilic POPs will increase total body burden. These accumulated POPs are slowly released into the bloodstream, and more so during weight loss. Thus, AT constitutes a continual source of internal exposure to POPs. In addition to its buffering function, AT is also a target of POPs and may mediate part of their metabolic effects. This is particularly relevant because many POPs induce obesogenic effects that may lead to quantitative and qualitative alterations of AT. Some POPs also induce a proinflammatory state in AT, which may lead to detrimental metabolic effects. Conclusion: AT appears to play diverse functions both as a modulator and as a target of POPs toxicity.},

A perfluorophenyl column packed with sub-2-mm particles and a C8 precolumn were applied to accomplish RRLC analysis with symmetric peak shapes. Urine samples were diluted 10-fold with Milli-Q water prior to autoinjection for direct quantification of 34 target analytes with negligible matrix effect. Gradient elution and dynamic multiple reaction monitoring were used for simultaneous quantitation of 34 BDZs, metabolites, and BDZ analogs. Good recovery was obtained in the range of 80.2-98.5% and the limit of detection ranged from 0.01 ng/mL to 0.5 ng/mL for all 34 target analytes in spiked urine. Moreover, good precision and accuracy were obtained for quantitative determination in diluted urine samples by the proposed RRLC/QqQ-MS method for intra-day/inter-day assays in the ranges of 0.1-8.8%/0.1-8.9% and 91.2-106.1%/89.6-104.6%, respectively. The applicability of this newly developed RRLC/QqQ-MS method was demonstrated by quantitative determination of BDZs, metabolites, and BDZ analogs in various clinical urine samples. © 2013, Food and Drug Administration, Taiwan.

abstract={Perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) is a persistent organic pollutant that is toxic, bioaccumulative and undergoes wide transportation across all environmental media. It has been widely detected in environmental samples but there is limited information about the health effects on humans from environmental exposure. This paper presents the findings of a review of the literature on the impact of PFOS on the health of the general population. Fifteen relevant epidemiological studies were identified that looked at the association between human PFOS exposure and a range of health related outcomes. Small but statistically significant associations have been reported with PFOS and total cholesterol, glucose metabolism, body mass index (BMI), thyroid function, infertility, breast feeding, uric acid and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The true significance of these findings is uncertain due to the inconsistencies in some of the study results and the limitations of the literature. The majority of studies were cross-sectional and considered surrogate markers of health (e.g. cholesterol levels). The available literature is also limited in ascertaining the link between PFOS concentrations in the environment, exposure pathways and health effects. We conclude that the current evidence is inconclusive and further large-scale prospective cohort studies would be useful to assess the association between environmental exposure to PFOS, appropriate biomarkers (e.g. serum levels of PFOS) and health outcomes. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Background: Disruption of developing immune and respiratory systems by early-life exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) could result into reduced capacity to fight infections and increased risk to develop allergic manifestations later in life. Objectives: To systematically review the epidemiologic literature on the adverse effects of early-life exposure to POPs on respiratory health, allergy and the immune system in infancy, childhood and adolescence. Methods: Based on published guidelines for systematic reviews, two independent researchers searched for published articles in MEDLINE and SCOPUS using defined keywords on POPs and respiratory health, immune function and allergy. Study eligibility criteria were defined to select the articles. Results: This review of 41 studies finds limited evidence for prenatal exposure to DDE, PCBs and dioxins and risk of respiratory infections. Evidence was limited also for postnatal exposure to PCBs, specifically ndl-PCBs, and reduced immune response after vaccination in childhood. The review indicates lack of association between postnatal exposure to PCBs/ndl-PCBs and risk of asthma-related symptoms. For the other exposure-outcome associations reviewed evidence was inadequate. Discussion and conclusion: Current epidemiological evidence suggests that early-life exposure to POPs can adversely influence immune and respiratory systems development. Heterogeneity between studies in exposure and outcome assessment and the small number of studies for any given exposure-outcome relationship currently make comparisons difficult and meta-analyses impossible. Also, mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Recommendations for significantly improving our understanding thus include harmonization of exposure and outcome assessment between studies, conduct of larger studies, long-term assessment of respiratory infections and asthma symptoms in order to identify critical periods of susceptibility, integration of the potential immunotoxic mechanisms of POPs, and use of new statistical tools to detangle the role of multiple exposures on multiple outcomes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Newborn screening (NBS) for medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD), one of the most common disorders identified, uses measurement of octanoylcarnitine (C8) from dried blood spots. In the state of Ohio, as in many places, primary care providers, with or without consultation from a metabolic specialist, may perform "confirmatory testing", with the final diagnostic decision returned to the state. Confirmatory testing may involve measurement of metabolites, enzyme analysis, mutation screening, or sequencing. We now report sequencing results for infants said to have "false positive" NBS results for MCAD deficiency, or who died before confirmatory testing could be performed. Methods: Dried blood spots (DBS) were obtained from all 18 available NBS cards identified as "false positive" by NBS for the 3. year period after screening began in Ohio in 2003 (N=20, thus 2 had no DBS available), and from all 6 infants with abnormal screens who died before confirmatory testing could be obtained. DNA extracted from DBS was screened for the common c.985A. >G mutation in exon 11 of the ACADM gene, using a specific restriction digest method, followed by sequencing of the 12 exons, intron-exon junctions, and several hundred base pairs of the 5' untranslated region. Results: The NBS cut-off value for C8 used was 0.7. μmol/L. Sequencing of ACADM in six neonates with elevated C8 on NBS who died before confirmatory testing was obtained did not identify any significant variants in the coding region of the gene, suggesting that MCADD was not a contributing factor in these deaths. The mean C8 for the 18 surviving infants labeled as "False Positives" was 0.90 (95%CI 0.77-1.15), much lower than the mean value for confirmed cases. Ten of the 18 were premature births weighing <1200. g, the rest were normal sized and full term. Eight infants, mostly full term with appropriate birth weight, were heterozygous for the common c.985A. >G mutation; one of those also has a novel sequence change identified in exon 9 that predicts a PRO to LEU change at residue 258 of the protein. Both the phase and any possible clinical significance of the variant are unknown, but several lines of evidence suggest that it could lead to protein malfunction. That child had an NBS C8 of 2.2, more than double the mean for the False Positive group. Unfortunately, the study design did not provide clinical outcome data, but the child is not known to have presented clinically by age 7. years. Conclusions: These results suggest that sequencing of ACADM from dried blood spots can be one useful follow-up tool to provide accurate genetic counseling in the situation of an infant with elevated C8 on NBS who dies before confirmatory testing is obtained. Of surviving neonates, there appear to be two populations of infants with false positive NBS C8 values: 1) term AGA infants who are heterozygous for the common c.985A. >G mutation, and, 2) premature infants, regardless of carrier status. The finding of two sequence variants in an infant reported to the state as not affected suggests the possibility that some infants with two mutations may be reported as normal at follow-up. State registries may wish to consider asking that metabolic specialists, who are most familiar with the variability of these rare disorders, be involved in the final diagnostic evaluation. Finally, providers may wish to consider ACADM sequencing, or other diagnostic testing, as part of the confirmatory evaluation for infants with NBS C8 concentrations that are significantly above the cut-off value, even if plasma and urine metabolites are not strikingly increased. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) requires a drastic increases in production of advanced biofuels up to 36 billion gallons over the next decade while corn-based ethanol will be capped at 15 billion gallons. Currently ethanol is the predominant alternative fuel and is widely distributed at 10 vol % blends in gasoline (E10). However, certain properties of ethanol make it less desirable as a blending agent in particular at higher blend levels. Therefore the engine- and vehicle-related properties of longer chain alcohols are evaluated in comparison to gasoline to determine their suitability as blending agents for spark-ignition engine fuels. This analytical study aims at providing comprehensive property data for a range of alcohol isomers with a carbon count up to C8. Relevant physical property data is used to determine the general suitability of longer chain alcohol isomers as blending agents based on factors such as melting point and boiling. Based on initial findings the scope of the study was narrowed down to alcohols in the C2-C6 range. It was determined that the engine- and combustion-relevant information is missing from the literature for a wide range of longer chain isomers. Thus fuel testing for engine-relevant properties such as lower heating value, knock resistance (RON, MON) and Reid Vapour Pressure (RVP) for alcohols up to C6 was performed as part of this study. Data suggests that the melting point of alcohols increases with increasing carbon count and all C7 and C8 isomers exhibit melting points in excess of -40°C making their use as vehicle fuel questionable. Boiling points increase with increasing carbon count and n-structures generally have slightly higher boiling points than their respective iso-structures. Latent heat of vaporization decreases with carbon count, the mass-specific value for ethanol is triple that of gasoline, the energy specific ratio increases to a factor of 5. Alcohol fuels generally have a significantly lower RVP than gasoline, RVP decreases with increasing carbon count. Stoichiometric air demand and fuel energy content increase with carbon count. Knock resistance expressed as Research Octane Number (RON) and Motor Octane Number (MON) decreases significantly with increasing carbon count, iso-structures show increased knock resistance compared to their respective n-structures. This study is limited to analytical results as well as fuel property testing according to ASTM standards. Only properties of neat alcohols are evaluated in comparison to gasoline certification fuel, gasoline blend stock for ethanol blending and E10. The analysis of the reported properties is further focused on spark-ignition engine applications only. Future phases of this project will include the assessment of properties of multi-component blends as well as efficiency, performance and emissions testing on a modern direct-injection engine. While data for a limited number of commonly used alcohols such as ethanol and iso-butanol is available in the literature, little or no data is available for a majority of other alcohols and their isomers. In addition, engine-related data published in the past occasionally disregards the significant differences between alcohol isomers of the same chain length. This study offers a comprehensive review of physical properties of alcohols and their common isomers in the C2-C8 range as they relate to in-vehicle use and spark-ignition combustion engine application. Data presented in this paper suggests that higher alcohols have certain physical properties that might be desirable for blending with gasoline. Due to their oxygen content all alcohols have an inherent disadvantage in terms of energy content compared to non-oxygenated fuels. While this disadvantage becomes less pronounced with increasing carbon count, other less desirable properties such as a low RVP and reduced knock resistance become more dominant with longer chain length alcohols. In addition to merely evaluating properties, the selection of promising alcohols and blend levels will ultimately depend on the introduction scenario and target properties. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={A plant fibrous-bed bioreactor (PFB) was constructed for propionic acid production. Sugar cane bagasse was applied to the PFB as immobilizing material. Starting at a concentration of 80. g/L of glucose, Propionibacterium freudenreichii CCTCC M207015 produced 41.20 ± 2.03. g/L of propionic acid at 108. h in the PFB. The value was 21.07% higher than that produced by free cell fermentation. Intermittent and constant fed-batch fermentations were performed in the PFB to optimize the fermentation results. The highest propionic acid concentration obtained from constant fed-batch fermentation was 136.23 ± 6.77. g/L, which is 1.40 times higher than the highest concentration (97.00. g/L) previously reported. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that cells exhibited striking changes in morphology after PFB domestication. Compared with free cell fermentation, the fluxes of propionic acid synthesis and the pentose phosphate pathway in PFB fermentation increased by 84.65% and 227.62%, respectively. On the other hand, a decrease in succinic and acetic acid fluxes was also observed. The metabolic flux distributions of the two PFB fed-batch fermentation strategies also demonstrated that constant fed-batch fermentation is a more beneficial method for the immobilized production of propionic acid. The relevant key enzyme activities and metabolic flux variations of the batch cultures showed good consistency. These results suggest that the PFB was effective in high-concentration propionic acid production. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Environmental contextPerfluoroalkyl acids are persistent environmental contaminants that are also found in soils. We use a metabolomics approach based on nuclear magnetic resonance analyses to investigate the responses of earthworms to exposure to sub-lethal levels of two perfluoroalkyl acids. The results indicate that this metabolomics approach is able to delineate the toxic mode of action of contaminants present at sub-lethal levels. AbstractMetabolomics entails the analysis of endogenous metabolites within organisms exposed to an external stressor such as an environmental contaminant. We utilised 1H NMR-based metabolomics to elucidate sub-lethal toxic mechanisms of Eisenia fetida earthworms after exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Earthworms were exposed to a range of concentrations of PFOA (6.25 to 50gcm-2) and PFOS (3.125 to 25gcm-2) by contact tests for 2 days. Earthworm tissues were extracted using a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water, and the polar fraction was analysed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. NMR-based metabolomic analysis revealed heightened E. fetida toxic responses with higher PFOA and PFOS exposure concentrations. Principal component analysis (PCA) exhibited significant separation between control and exposed earthworms along PC1 for all PFOA and PFOS exposure concentrations. Leucine, arginine, glutamate, maltose and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are potential indicators of PFOA and PFOS exposure as these metabolite concentrations fluctuated with exposure. Our data also indicate that PFOA and PFOS exposure may increase fatty acid oxidation and interrupt ATP synthesis due to a disruption in the inner mitochondrial membrane structure. NMR-based metabolomics has promise as an insightful tool for elucidating the environmental toxicology of sub-lethal contaminant exposure. © 2012 CSIRO.},

abstract={The thermal and chemical stability of perfluoropentacene (PFP) thin films grown by organic molecular beam deposition onto the (111)-oriented surfaces of the coinage metals copper, silver, and gold have been studied by means of temperature dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Near-Edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS). Under vacuum conditions, PFP multilayers are completely desorbed at 425 K while molecules in contact with the Au(111) surface remain intact up to 500 K. By contrast, PFP that is in contact with Cu(111) is distinctly distorted and becomes partially defluorinated already upon thermal desorption of multilayers. A pronounced defluorination of PFP also takes place on Ag(111) at temperatures around 440 K, while further heating causes a complete cracking and defluorination. Additional measurements carried out on a regularly stepped silver surface demonstrate that steps are active sites that promote defluorination already at lower temperatures. van der Waals corrected density-functional (DFT-D) calculations show that PFP, though being weakly adsorbed on all three metal surfaces, exhibits a reduced energy barrier for defluorination, in particular on copper and silver, thus reflecting their catalytic activity. The calculations reveal further that defluorinated molecules are covalently bound to the substrate, leading to a notable bending of the molecular backbone. The present study highlights the importance of also considering chemical reactions when theoretically analyzing molecule/metal interactions and indicates that fluorinated aromatic molecules, though offering interesting electronic properties, actually exhibit a limited stability in contact with some electrode surfaces like silver due to catalytic effects. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={According to the age-of-acquisition hypothesis, words acquired early in life are processed faster and more accurately than words acquired later. Connectionist models have begun to explore the influence of the age/order of acquisition of items (and also their frequency of encounter). This study attempts to reconcile two different methodological and theoretical approaches (proposed by Lambon Ralph & Ehsan, 2006 and Zevin & Seidenberg, 2002) to age-limited learning effects. The current simulations extend the findings reported by Zevin and Seidenberg (2002) that have shown that frequency trajectories (FTs) have limited and specific effects on word-reading tasks. Using the methodological framework proposed by Lambon Ralph and Ehsan (2006), which makes it possible to compare word-reading and picture-naming tasks in connectionist networks, we were able to show that FT has a considerable influence on age-limited learning effects in a picture naming task. The findings show that when the input-output mappings are arbitrary (simulating picture naming tasks), the links formed by the network become entrenched as a result of early experience and that subsequent variations in frequency of exposure of the items have only a minor impact. In contrast, when the mappings between input-output are quasi-systematic or systematic (simulating word-reading tasks), the training of new items was generalized and resulted in the suppression of age-limited learning effects. At a theoretical level, we suggest that FT, which simultaneously takes account of time and the level of exposure across time, represents a more precise and modulated measure compared with the order of introduction of the items and may lead to innovative hypotheses in the field of age-limited learning effects. © 2012 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.},

abstract={Definitive chemoradiation therapy has evolved as the preferred organ preservation strategy in the treatment of locally advanced head-and-neck cancer (LA-HNC). Dry mouth and dysphagia are among the most common and most debilitating treatment-related toxicities that frequently necessitate the placement of enteral feeding tubes (FT) in these patients to help them meet their nutritional requirements. The use of either a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube or a nasogastric tube, the choice of using a prophylactic vs a reactive approach, and the effects of FTs on weight loss, hospitalization, quality of life, and long-term functional outcomes are areas of continued controversy. Considerable variations in practice patterns exist in the United States and abroad. This critical review synthesizes the current data for the use of enteral FTs in this patient population and clarifies the relative advantages of different types of FTs and the timing of their use. Recent developments in the biologic understanding and treatment approaches for LA-HNC appear to be favorably impacting the frequency and severity of treatment-related dysphagia and may reduce the need for enteral tube feeding in the future. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The occurrence of chemicals in sludge from sewage treatment plants (STPs) is of concern for human health and the environment. Legislations and regulations are put in place to minimize the release of harmful chemicals into the environment and arable land, e.g. via application of sewage sludge. Temporal trends analysis of sludge contaminants can be used to assess the effectiveness of such actions. Such analyses can be performed retrospectively, using sludge stored in environmental specimen banks, to investigate new or emerging environmental contaminants. The present study provides data from time-trend analyses of metals, persistent organic pollutants, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and other organic compounds in sludge from Swedish. The analysis showed that sludge is a suitable matrix for time-trend studies and it can take on average 12 years (range, 5-26 years) to track an annual change of ±10% (with a power of 80%). Statistically significant trends were found for 18 out of the 77 compounds subjected to analysis, of which 75% showed decreasing trends. Triclosan and the antibiotic norfloxacin followed the same trend as the national recorded usage and decreased annually by 65% and 60%, respectively. The opposite was true for the methylsiloxanes, which showed an annual average increase of about 30%. A downward trend (about 20% year-1) was observed for the polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs 154 and 183), while PBDE 209 increased by 16%. Further measurements are required to determine if the substitution of PBDEs by chlorinated paraffins or organophosphorus compounds have resulted in increased concentrations of the latter in sludge. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The biosynthesis pathway to diadinoxanthin and fucoxanthin was elucidated in Phaeodactylum tricornutum by a combined approach involving metabolite analysis identification of gene function. For the initial steps leading to β-carotene, putative genes were selected from the genomic database and the function of several of them identified by genetic pathway complementation in Escherichia coli. They included genes encoding a phytoene synthase, a phytoene desaturase, a ζ-carotene desaturase, and a lycopene β-cyclase. Intermediates of the pathway beyond β-carotene, present in trace amounts, were separated by TLC and identified as violaxanthin and neoxanthin in the enriched fraction. Neoxanthin is a branching point for the synthesis of both diadinoxanthin and fucoxanthin and the mechanisms for their formation were proposed. A single isomerization of one of the allenic double bounds in neoxanthin yields diadinoxanhin. Two reactions, hydroxylation at C8 in combination with a keto-enol tautomerization and acetylation of the 3′-HO group results in the formation of fucoxanthin. © 2012 The Author.},

abstract={Objectives To determine and compare the diagnostic performance of stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), using conventional coronary angiography (CCA) as the reference standard. Methods We searched Medline and Embase for literature that evaluated stress MPI for the diagnosis of obstructive CAD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrastenhanced echocardiography (ECHO), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). Results All pooled analyses were based on random effects models. Articles on MRI yielded a total of 2,970 patients from 28 studies, articles on ECHO yielded a sample size of 795 from 10 studies, articles on SPECT yielded 1,323 from 13 studies. For CAD defined as either at least 50 %, at least 70 % or at least 75 % lumen diameter reduction on CCA, the natural logarithms of the diagnostic odds ratio (lnDOR) for MRI (3.63; 95 % CI 3.26-4.00) was significantly higher compared to that of SPECT (2.76; 95 % CI 2.28-3.25; P=0.006) and that of ECHO (2.83; 95 % CI 2.29-3.37; P=0.02). There was no significant difference between the lnDOR of SPECT and ECHO (P=0.52). Conclusion Our results suggest that MRI is superior for the diagnosis of obstructive CAD compared with ECHO and SPECT. ECHO and SPECT demonstrated similar diagnostic performance. Key Points ̇ MRI can assess myocardial perfusion. ̇ MR perfusion diagnoses coronary artery disease better than echocardiography or SPECT. ̇ Echocardiography and SPECT have similar diagnostic performance. ̇ MRI can save coronary artery disease patients from more invasive tests. ̇ MRI and SPECT show evidence of publication bias, implying possible overestimation. © European Society of Radiology 2012.},

abstract={Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria, a deadly infectious disease for which treatments are scarce and drug-resistant parasites are now increasingly found. A comprehensive method of identifying and quantifying metabolites of this intracellular parasite could expand the arsenal of tools to understand its biology, and be used to develop new treatments against the disease. Here, we present two methods based on liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for reliable measurement of water-soluble metabolites involved in phospholipid biosynthesis, as well as several other metabolites that reflect the metabolic status of the parasite including amino acids, carboxylic acids, energy-related carbohydrates, and nucleotides. A total of 35 compounds was quantified. In the first method, polar compounds were retained by hydrophilic interaction chromatography (amino column) and detected in negative mode using succinic acid- 13C 4 and fluorovaline as internal standards. In the second method, separations were carried out using reverse phase (C18) ion-pair liquid chromatography, with heptafluorobutyric acid as a volatile ion pairing reagent in positive detection mode, using d 9-choline and 4-aminobutanol as internal standards. Standard curves were performed in P. falciparum-infected and uninfected red blood cells using standard addition method (r 2&gt;0.99). The intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision as well as the extraction recovery of each compound were determined. The lower limit of quantitation varied from 50pmol to 100fmol/3×10 7cells. These methods were validated and successfully applied to determine intracellular concentrations of metabolites from uninfected host RBCs and isolated Plasmodium parasites. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Clinical scenario: A 37-year-old man suffered a complete spinal cord injury (C8, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale [ASIA] score A) 10 years ago in a car accident. Should primary prevention of cardiovascular disease be a priority in this patient? In order to answer this question, we performed a systematic review of the literature to inform an evidence-based clinical review. The objective was to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the clinical management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Comprehensive literature searches were performed. The quality of each study was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale for randomized controlled trials, and the Downs and Black Scale for all other studies. Levels of evidence were assigned using a modified version of Sackett's scale. Our findings indicate that CVD is a critical issue in individuals with chronic SCI. Almost all risk factors for CVD are amplified in individuals with SCI, including physical inactivity, dyslipidemia, blood pressure irregularities, abnormal glycemic control, and chronic inflammation. However, there is a paucity of high-quality literature with respect to treatment outcomes in SCI-specific study populations (a total of 22 intervention studies in all of these categories combined) that allow for the development of evidence-informed clinical practice recommendations. These limitations notwithstanding, we present a series of contemporary practice suggestions with regard to CVD event risk modification in SCI patients. For optimal outcomes, health care providers should be cognizant of these heightened CVD risk factors and the resultant increased CVD morbidity and mortality in SCI patients. Despite the absence of high-quality evidence-based treatment strategies, clinicians should re-examine their own CVD risk factor treatment strategies to better reflect contemporary practice in similar high-CVD-event-risk patients and populations. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

A further finding was that individuals with a C injury exhibited a lower resting SBP in the seated vs supine position. Thus, clinicians and researchers should consiDer lesion level and body position when measuring and interpreting CV parameters in individuals with SCI. © 2012 International Spinal Cord Society.},

abstract={Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is an anthropogenic contaminant that differs in several ways from most other well-studied organic chemicals found in drinking water. PFOA is extremely resistant to environmental degradation processes and thus persists indefinitely. Unlike most other persistent and bioaccumulative organic pollutants, PFOA is water-soluble, does not bind well to soil or sediments, and bioaccumulates in serum rather than in fat. It has been detected in finished drinking water and drinking water sources impacted by releases from industrial facilities and waste water treatment plants, as well as in waters with no known point sources. However, the overall occurrence and population exposure from drinking water is not known. PFOA persists in humans with a half-life of several years and is found in the serum of almost all U.S. residents and in populations worldwide. Exposure sources include food, food packaging, consumer products, house dust, and drinking water. Continued exposure to even relatively low concentrations in drinking water can substantially increase total human exposure, with a serum:drinking water ratio of about 100:1. For example, ongoing exposures to drinking water concentrations of 10. ng/L, 40. ng/L, 100 ng/L, or 400 ng/L are expected to increase mean serum levels by about 25%, 100%, 250%, and 1000%, respectively, from the general population background serum level of about 4. ng/mL. Infants are potentially a sensitive subpopulation for PFOA's developmental effects, and their exposure through breast milk from mothers who use contaminated drinking water and/or from formula prepared with contaminated drinking water is higher than in adults exposed to the same drinking water concentration. Numerous health endpoints are associated with human PFOA exposure in the general population, communities with contaminated drinking water, and workers. As is the case for most such epidemiology studies, causality for these effects is not proven. Unlike most other well-studied drinking water contaminants, the human dose-response curve for several effects appears to be steepest at the lower exposure levels, including the general population range, with no apparent threshold for some endpoints. There is concordance in animals and humans for some effects, while humans and animals appear to react differently for other effects such as lipid metabolism. PFOA was classified as "likely to be carcinogenic in humans" by the USEPA Science Advisory Board. In animal studies, developmental effects have been identified as more sensitive endpoints for toxicity than carcinogenicity or the long-established hepatic effects. Notably, exposure to an environmentally relevant drinking water concentration caused adverse effects on mammary gland development in mice. This paper reviews current information relevant to the assessment of PFOA as an emerging drinking water contaminant. This information suggests that continued human exposure to even relatively low concentrations of PFOA in drinking water results in elevated body burdens that may increase the risk of health effects. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Methods: Reports of studies using randomized controlled trials (RCT) to compare PFNA with DHS in the management of intertrochanteric fractures were retrieved (up to December 5, 2011) from the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Elsevier, the Chinese Biomedical Database, Wanfang Data, and manually. Methodological quality of the trials was critically assessed, and relevant data were extracted. Statistical software Revman® 5.0 was used for data-analysis. Results; Thirteen RCTs involving 958 cases were included in the Meta-analysis. The results showed that, compared with DHS, PFNA significantly decreased the duration of surgery [WMD = -21.38, 95%CI (-33.05, -9.26), P<0.05], intra-operative blood loss [WMD = -176.36, 95%CI (-232.20, -120.52), P<0.05], the rate of post-operative complication [RR=0.46, 95%CI (0.31, 0.70), P<0.05], the rate of post-operative fixation failure [RR=0.27, 95%CI(0.11, 0.62), P<0.05]. Conclusion: PFNA for intertrochanteric fractures is superior to DHS in regards to the mean duration of surgery, mean intra-operative blood loss, the rate of post-operative complication, and the rate of post-operative fixation failure. But there is not enough evidence to show any difference between PFNA and DHS in regards to the mean duration of hospital, the mean duration of fracture healing, the rate of post-operative fracture, the rate of post-operative coxa vara, the rate of postoperative superficial wound infection, the rate of other post-operative complications or the Harris score after surgery.},

The most common R FI synthetic conversions were (i) free-radical addition to carbon-carbon double or triple bonds, (ii) coupling to aryl halides, and (iii) Grignard, organolithium, or similar R F anion addition to ketones and aldehydes. R FI were also used as a chain transfer reagent in free-radical polymerization reactions of fluorinated and other unsaturated monomers. Second, a complementary Chemical Abstracts' STN AnaVist ® search was employed to summarize the 779 publications describing reaction products that contained n-perfluoroalkyl chains (C nF 2n+1-, where n = 2-4). The most common uses for materials into which R FI was incorporated were surfactants, pesticides, electronic materials, pharmaceuticals, liquid crystals, dyes and optical materials, battery electrolytes, repellents, lubricants and polymerization catalysts. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={An optimized inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method was used to analyze trace metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, and Sn) in vegetable and oil samples. Prior to analysis, the samples were accurately weighed into a Teflon digestion vessel and the metals extracted from their matrix by using nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide in a closed-vessel digestion system. The proposed method is sensitive, with limits of detection between 5 and 38 ng/kg, and precise, with relative standard deviations from 2.8 to 6.1%. In order to verify its accuracy, the method was used to analyze the Standard Reference Materials NCS ZC85006 Tomato and Certified Used Oil HU-1. The method was successfully applied to the comparative determination of residues of the studied metals in vegetable (tomato, pepper, onion, spinach, lettuce, carrots, and marrow squash) and oil samples (virgin olive, maize, sunflower, and olive pomace) from Spain and Morocco. The results obtained revealed that the contents in metal residues depend on the particular type of food and its origin, probably due to the different production, processing, storage, and preservation methods. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

In this study a piston propelled flow-batch analyzer (PFBA) for the determination of Cu, Cr and Pb in gasoline and naphtha by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF AAS) was explored. Investigative phase modeling for low dilution was conducted both for gasoline and naphtha microemulsions. Rheological considerations were also explored including a mathematical flow derivation to fine tune the system's operational parameters, and the GF AAS coupling. Both manual and automated procedures for microemulsion preparation were compared. The results of the paired t test at a 95% confidence level showed no significant differences between them. Further recovery test results confirmed a negligible matrix effect of the sample on the analyte absorption signals and an efficient stabilization of the samples (with metals) submitted to microemulsion treatment. The accuracy of the developed procedure was attested by good recovery percentages in the ranges of 100.0. ±. 3.5% for Pb in the naphtha samples, and 100.2. ±. 3.4% and 100.7. ±. 4.6% for Cu and Cr, respectively in gasoline samples. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a heterogeneous disease and its management remains one of the most controversial topics in pediatrics. Management options include surveillance, antibiotics, and surgery. The approval of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (DHA) as a bulking agent by the Food and Drug Administration was followed by wide acceptance of endoscopic techniques as a major tool in the management of reflux. Pyelonephritis rather than VUR is the most common cause of kidney damage in children. It should be emphasized that the primary goal of diagnosing and treating VUR should be preventing this complication. There are no sufficient data in the literature to address the impact of the different treatment modalities on the incidence of febrile urinary tract infections (feb-UTIs) denoting pyelonephritis, with very few studies evaluating endoscopic treatment in light of this clear and well-defined outcome. The fact that we can correct the anatomy at the vesicoureteral junction with a simple and relatively safe outpatient procedure does not justify offering it to all patients. In this review, we attempt to critically evaluate the available literature pertaining to the impact of different treatment modalities on reducing the incidence of febrile UTIs and kidney damage, with a special emphasis on endoscopic treatment. © IPNA 2011.},

abstract={Polar analytes that possess protic functional groups have often been treated with alkyl chloroformates to decrease their polarity and increase their volatility prior to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. This derivatization reaction has two distinct advantages. It proceeds smoothly in aqueous media, and the desired reaction products are efficiently separated from interfering ionic components by their extraction into a water-immiscible organic phase. In the present work, the derivatization-liquid liquid sample preparation was examined in detail for analysis of a potential urinary dipeptide biomarker l-prolyl-4-l-hydroxyproline (PHP) by downstream liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry. PHP was treated with a series of alkyl and fluoroalkyl chloroformates in aqueous media, and the detected reaction products were investigated. Smooth conversion of PHP into the N-isobutyloxycarbonyl isobutyl ester was accomplished by the coupled action of isobutanol, isobutyl chloroformate and the pyridine catalyst. This derivative afforded a highest detector response from all the derivatized forms examined, including the nonderivatized PHP. A simple isocratic elution on a common RP-C18 HPLC column coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, and use of the synthesized heptadeuterated analog (D7-PHP) as an internal standard, enabled validation of the method and determination of PHP in human urine in less than 5min. The in situ derivatization-liquid liquid extraction has thus been demonstrated to be a useful sample preparation strategy for the analysis of polar metabolites by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in the complex urine matrix. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Interest in the formation of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts (N-DBPs) has increased because toxicological research has indicated that they are often more genotoxic, cytotoxic, or carcinogenic than many of the carbonaceous disinfection byproducts (C-DBPs) that have been a focus for previous research. Moreover, population growth has forced utilities to exploit source waters impaired by wastewater effluents or algal blooms. Both waters feature higher levels of organic nitrogen, that might serve as N-DBP precursors. Utilities are exploring new disinfectant combinations to reduce the formation of regulated trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids. As some of these new combinations may promote N-DBP formation, characterization of N-DBP formation pathways is needed. Formation pathways for halonitroalkanes, halonitriles, haloamides, and N-nitrosamines associated with chlorine, ozone, chlorine dioxide, UV, and chloramine disinfection are critically reviewed. Several important themes emerge from the review. First, the formation pathways of the N-DBP families are partially linked because most of the pathways involve similar amine precursors. Second, it is unlikely that a disinfection scheme that is free of byproduct formation will be discovered. Disinfectant combinations should be optimized to reduce the overall exposure to toxic byproducts. Third, the understanding of formation pathways should be employed to devise methods of applying disinfectants that minimize byproduct formation while accomplishing pathogen reduction goals. Fourth, the well-characterized nature of the monomers constituting the biopolymers that likely dominate the organic nitrogen precursor pool should be exploited to predict the formation of byproducts likely to form at high yields. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Background: Beneficial effects of fish consumption on early cognitive development and cardiovascular health have been attributed to the omega-3 fatty acids in fish and fish oils, but toxic chemicals in fish may adversely affect these health outcomes. Risk-benefit assessments of fish consumption have frequently focused on methylmercury and omega-3 fatty acids, not persistent pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls, and none have evaluated Great Lakes fish consumption. Objectives: The risks and benefits of fish consumption have been established primarily for marine fish. Here, we examine whether sufficient data are available to evaluate the risks and benefits of eating freshwater fish from the Great Lakes. Methods: We used a scoping review to integrate information from multiple state, provincial, and federal agency sources regarding the contaminants and omega-3 fatty acids in Great Lakes fish and fish consumers, consumption rates and fish consumption advisories, and health effects of contaminants and omega-3 fatty acids. Data synthesis: Great Lakes fish contain persistent contaminants-many of which have documented adverse health effects -that accumulate in humans consuming them. In contrast, data are sparse on omega-3 fatty acids in the fish and their consumers. Moreover, few studies have documented the social and cultural benefits of Great Lakes fish consumption, particularly for subsistence fishers and native communities. At this time, federal and state/provincial governments provide fish consumption advisories based solely on risk. Conclusions: Our knowledge of Great Lakes fish has critical gaps, particularly regarding the benefits of consumption. A risk-benefit analysis requires more information than is currently available on the concentration of omega-3 fatty acids in Great Lakes fish and their absorption by fish eaters in addition to more information on the social, cultural, and health consequences of changes in the amount of fish consumed.},

Study design: A retrospective cohort study and literature review. Methods: Fifteen patients were diagnosed and treated at the authors' institution from 1975 to 2010. In addition, 124 published cases were systematically reviewed. Results: The most common presentation of PFNS was a painless parotid mass with normal FN function. Eccentric, loosely attached intraparotid tumors underwent gross total resection with nerve preservation granting satisfactory postoperative FN function, whereas inseparable intraparotid tumors were observed in 8 cases with stable long-term size. Lesions that extended into the fallopian canal underwent complete resection with FN sacrifice and nerve grafting in 10 cases, whereas 1 patient received subtotal resection of the intraparotid portion with stereotactic radiotherapy targeting the intratemporal component. Conclusions: Intraparotid FN schwannomas present similar to other primary salivary gland neoplasms, making an early diagnosis challenging. Intraoperative recognition of gross tumor characteristics and early histologic diagnosis with strategic biopsy are critical. Information including tumor location and extent, preoperative FN function, and the gross relationship between the tumor and the FN may guide the surgeon toward an optimal treatment plan emphasizing long-term neurologic preservation. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA) has shown a high concentration of PM2.5 in its atmosphere since 2003. The contribution of possible sources of primary PM2.5 and its precursors is not known. In this paper we present the results of analyzing the chemical composition of sixty 24-hr samples of PM2.5 to determine possible sources of PM2.5 in the MMA. The samples were collected at the northeast and southeast of theMMA between November 22 andDecember 12, 2007, using low-volume devices. Teflon and quartz filters were used to collect the samples. The concentrations of 16 airborne trace elements were determined using x-ray fluorescence (XRF). Anions and cations were determined using ion chromatography. Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were determined by thermal optical analysis. The results show that Ca had the maximum mean concentration of all elements studied, followed by S. Enrichment factors above 50 were calculated for S, Cl, Cu, Zn, Br, and Pb. This indicates that these elements may come from anthropogenic sources. Overall, the major average components of PM2.5 were OC (41.7%), SO42- (22.9%), EC (7.4%), crustal material (11.4%), and NO3- (12.6%), which altogether accounted for 96% of the mass. Statistically, we did not find any difference in SO42- concentrations between the two sites. The fraction of secondary organic carbon was between 24% and 34%. The results of the factor analysis performed over 10 metals and OC and EC show that there are three main sources of PM2.5: crustal material and vehicle exhaust; industrial activity; and fuel oil burning. The results show that SO42-, OC, and crustal material are important components of PM2.5 in MMA. Further work is necessary to evaluate the proportion of secondary inorganic and organic aerosol in order to have a better understanding of the sources and precursors of aerosols in the MMA. Implications: The MMA has become one of the most air polluted areas in Mexico. High levels of PM2.5 have been measured and effective actions need to be taken to reduce air pollution and the associated health risks. Several sources of primary PM2.5 and precursors of secondary particles exist in theMMA. This study provides valuable information for the local environmental authorities to identify possible sources of primary PM2.5 and its precursors. The effectiveness of the actions taken to improve air quality will lead to health benefits for the population, reducing their associated costs. © 2012 A&amp;WMA.},

abstract={Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely used for treatment of animals. According to Council Directive 96/23/EC, residues of these drugs must be monitored because of the potential risk they pose to the consumers' health. For this reason an LC-MS-MS method was developed for detection of wide range of NSAIDs, including both "acidic" NSAIDs (carprofen, diclofenac, flunixin, meloxicam, phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, tolfenamic acid, mefenamic acid, naproxen, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, firocoxib, rofecoxib, and celecoxib) and "basic" NSAIDs (four metamizole metabolites). Analytes were extracted from milk samples with acetonitrile in the presence of ammonium acetate. One portion of the extract was directly analyzed for the presence of metamizole metabolites; a second portion was cleaned with an amino cartridge. All NSAIDs were separated on a Phenomenex Luna C8(2) column and analyzed by LC-MS-MS in negative (acidic NSAIDs) and positive (metamizole metabolites) ion modes. The method was validated in accordance with the requirements of Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. Within-laboratory reproducibility was in the range 7-28%, and accuracy was in the range 71-116%. The method enabled detection of all the analytes with the expected sensitivity, below the recommended concentrations. The method fulfills the criteria for confirmatory methods and, because of its efficiency, may also be used for screening purposes. The procedure was also successfully verified in the proficiency test organized by EU-RL in 2010. As far as the authors are aware, this is one of the first methods capable of detecting diclofenac residues below the MRL in milk (0.1 μg kg1). An additional advantage is the possibility of simultaneous determination of "acidic" NSAIDs and metamizole metabolites. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

The aim of this study is to determine the amount of trace elements and the contamination of the river sediments. Analysis of collected samples has been achieved using the prompt gamma activation analysis method. The samples, in form of powders, were enclosed in Teflon sheets. The spectra were analyzed using HYPERMET PC software and the chemical composition is calculated using an Excelmacro that provides the concentrations as molar and weight percentages, as well as the corresponding masses of the oxides. The validation of the analytical method is demonstrated with the analysis of a reference material. The results show that the distribution of the studied metals (Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr Ni, and As) in the basin is dependent on location with a very significant contamination by Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr, and Ni close to the lead mine sites. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary 2011.},

abstract={Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and related compounds have recently been designated as target chemicals for regulation by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). Many countries have investigated and tried to implement various countermea-sures in response to this decision. In this article, we collect reports concerning regulations and risk evaluations of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and review the current PFC management practiced in various countries. The first part of this review contains a comprehensive collection of proposed standard PFC values, including provisional tolerable daily intakes (pTDI), drinking water guidelines, and predicted non-effect concentrations (PNEC). The pTDI values ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 μg/kg/day for PFOS, and there are wide margins of safety for adults. Health risks for plant workers exposed to PFCs and for infants are of particular concern. The application of these proposed values in controlling PFC pollution is one approach that may effectively control human health risk without unduly sacrificing the benefits from PFC use. The second part of this review contains a collection and review of a number of regulations and countermeasures, such as an EU directive, regulation in Canada, and the Significant New Use Rule (SNUR), including voluntary control (i.e., production phase-out by 3M, stewardship programs, regulation in the semiconductor industry). Most of these regulations are based principally on the precautionary principle. However, they may not be as effective in pollution reduction as intended because the chemicals in question are already widely distributed in the environment owing to their use and mobility in the environment. In addition, these types of regulations would be non-operative in developing countries because rapidly growing economies place great demand on high performance materials, including PFCs. Further development of risk assessment methods that allow the evaluation of the counter risks of PFC alternatives and the loss of benefits from the PFC ban is necessary because of the possible continuous use of PFCs, especially in developing countries. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Their popularity is linked to the ability of pyrenes to function as polarity-sensitive and quenchable fluorophores, excimer-generating units, aromatic stacking moieties and nucleic acid duplex intercalators. These characteristics have enabled development of PFOs for detection of complementary DNA/RNA targets, discrimination of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and generation of π-arrays on nucleic acid scaffolds. This critical review will highlight the physical properties and applications of PFOs that are likely to provide high degree of positional control of the chromophore in nucleic acid complexes. Particular emphasis will be placed on pyrene-functionalized Locked Nucleic Acids (LNAs) since these materials display interesting properties such as fluorescence quantum yields approaching unity and recognition of mixed-sequence double stranded DNA (144 references). © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

In a first step, the various theoretical and experimental studies performed on membrane gas separation processes under cyclic operations are reviewed. With respect to the cycle duration, these operations are classified into short and long classes. In a second step, a systematic analysis of the potential interest of the short class of cyclic operation compared to steady-state performances, namely an improved selectivity or a reverse selectivity, has been performed based on trade-off correlations applied to 2145 gas pairs. A series of gas pairs of potential interest for transient operation has been identified thanks to this approach. Four case studies ({He,N2}, {He,Ar}, {H2,C3H8} and UF6 isotopes), based on experimental solubility and diffusion data, have been investigated and the optimized separation performances for cyclic operations are compared to steady-state operations in terms of selectivity and productivity. Generally speaking, the possibility to increase the separation selectivity by cyclic operation logically needs to be carefully counterbalanced by a decrease in productivity. Finally, further work, potential applications and unexplored issues of cyclic membrane gas separation processes are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The method was applied to real samples of subjects who had received therapeutic doses of fentanyl, showing its suitability for the determination of low levels of these substances. The method was also applied to a subject whose death was attributed to fentanyl overdose. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. A sensitive method for determining alfentanyl, sufentanyl, fentanyl (and its major metabolite norfentanyl) in urine is described. The method was fully validated and applied to real samples from subjects who had received therapeutic doses of fentanyl, and to a subject whose death was attributed to fentanyl overdose. © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The goal of this article is to summarize new biological monitoring information on perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in aquatic ecosystems (post-2005) as a followup to our critical review published in 2006. A wider range of geographical locations (e.g., South America, Russia, Antarctica) and habitats (e.g., high-mountain lakes, deep-ocean, and offshore waters) have been investigated in recent years enabling a better understanding of the global distribution of PFCs in aquatic organisms. High concentrations of PFCs continue to be detected in invertebrates, fish, reptiles, and marine mammals worldwide. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is still the predominant PFC detected (mean concentrations up to 1900 ng/g ww) in addition to important concentrations of long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs; sum PFCAs up to 400 ng/g ww). More studies have evaluated the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of these compounds in both freshwater and marine food webs. Several reports have indicated a decrease in PFOS levels over time in contrast to PFCA concentrations that have tended to increase in tissues of aquatic organisms at many locations. The detection of precursor metabolites and isomers has become more frequently reported in environmental assessments yielding important information on the sources and distribution of these contaminants. The integration of environmental/ecological characteristics (e.g., latitude/longitude, salinity, and/or trophic status at sampling locations) and biological variables (e.g., age, gender, life cycle, migration, diet composition, growth rate, food chain length, metabolism, and elimination) are essential elements in order to adequately study the environmental fate and distribution of PFCs and should be more frequently considered in study design. © Published 2011 by the American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is now widely accepted as a universal and sensitive analytical technique in different research fields. In this project, we applied the technology to the analysis of complex matrix composition by using urine samples from Fabry disease patients and controls. The aims of the project were: (1) to develop a new and rapid analytical procedure for the determination of trace metal concentrations in single droplets of urine using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS); and (2) to establish preliminary results for trace metal concentrations in Fabry disease patient urine samples and controls. The processing of samples required only drying a homogeneous urine sample. Different supports (or sample substrates) were used: Teflon sheets, Whatman 903 filter paper, Urine Kid paper and glass slides. In order to establish the merits of the analytical method developed, matrix-matched synthetic laboratory standards spiked with analytes of interest were prepared at low concentrations (μg L-1 level). The precision and accuracy of the analytical method were &lt;20% (LA-ICP-MS) for trace metals in 1 μL urine laboratory standards (at analyte concentrations of 300 ng mL-1). The limit of detection varied from 0.003 to 0.58 μg g-1 for lithium, boron, titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, arsenic, rubidium, strontium, molybdenum, silver, cadmium, barium, lead, and uranium. LA-ICP-MS allowed the quantification and comparison of different trace metals in urine samples from a Fabry disease patient and from a reference control individual. This method may be applicable to forensic science, particularly when only a small amount of dried urine sample is available for investigation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper proposes a critical review on the organic contamination of settled house dust and human exposure over the past 10 years and focused on sources, contaminations and measurement methods (sampling, pretreatment, storage and analysis). As many compounds were identified, arises the question of which ones to consider. Sensitive and selective analytical methods for simultaneous determination of targeted substances should be developed and evaluated. Various methods were described for sampling and sample preparation. Harmonization and standardization are needed to enable comparison of results from similar studies. Finally, an integrated multipollutant and multicompartment (settled dust, suspended particles and air) approach appears essential in order to determine the extent of the threat to public health posed by indoor contaminants. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are resistant to breakdown and are turning up in unexpected places around the world, becoming emerging food contaminants. Although these chemicals have been used in countless products since the 1950s, they have been subject to little control until now. There is still an insufficient knowledge of their sources, occurrence, and hazards for food safety decision making. This article provides a comprehensive review of the food contamination levels and dietary intake risks posed by PFCs, as well as the specific methods developed for their determination. It is based on the evaluation of the published literature between 2004 and the beginning of 2010, with special emphasis on those reports of the last two years and in the examination of the growing body of studies on the exposure assessment and food occurrence of PFCs. The current state-of-the art and future perspectives in extraction, clean-up, detection, identification, confirmation, and quantification highlighting the advantages and limitations of each technique have been summarized. How much is known about the sources and pathways of food web and human exposure, which is needed to control and manage the release of these emerging toxic contaminants, has also been explained. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions can deliver lipophilic therapeutic agents to solid tumors and simultaneously provide for monitoring nanocarrier biodistribution via ultrasonography and/or 19F MRI. In the first generation of block copolymer stabilized perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions, perfluoropentane (PFP) was used as the droplet forming compound. Although manifesting excellent therapeutic and ultrasound imaging properties, PFP nanoemulsions were unstable at storage, difficult to handle, and underwent hard to control phenomenon of irreversible droplet-to-bubble transition upon injection. To solve the above problems, perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether (PFCE) was used as a core forming compound in the second generation of block copolymer stabilized perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions. PFCE nanodroplets manifest both ultrasound and fluorine (19F) MR contrast properties, which allows using multimodal imaging and 19F MR spectroscopy for monitoring nanodroplet pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. In the present paper, acoustic, imaging, and therapeutic properties of unloaded and paclitaxel (PTX) loaded PFCE nanoemulsions are reported. As manifested by the 19F MR spectroscopy, PFCE nanodroplets are long circulating, with about 50% of the injected dose remaining in circulation 2 h after the systemic injection. Sonication with 1-MHz therapeutic ultrasound triggered reversible droplet-to-bubble transition in PFCE nanoemulsions. Microbubbles formed by acoustic vaporization of nanodroplets underwent stable cavitation. The nanodroplet size (200 nm to 350 nm depending on a type of the shell and conditions of emulsification) as well as long residence in circulation favored their passive accumulation in tumor tissue that was confirmed by ultrasonography. In the breast and pancreatic cancer animal models, ultrasound-mediated therapy with paclitaxel-loaded PFCE nanoemulsions showed excellent therapeutic properties characterized by tumor regression and suppression of metastasis. Anticipated mechanisms of the observed effects are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Organohalogen compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) are global environmental pollutants and highly persistent, bioaccumulative chemicals that produce adverse effects in humans and wildlife. Because of the widespread use of these organohalogens in household items and consumer products, indoor contamination is a significant source of human exposure, especially for children. One significant concern with regard to health effects associated with exposure to organohalogens is endocrine disruption. Toxicological studies on organohalogen pollutants primarily focused on sex steroid and thyroid hormone actions, and findings have largely shaped the way one envisions their disruptive effects occurring. Organohalogens exert additional effects on other systems including other complex endocrine systems that may be disregulated at various levels of organization. Over the last 20 years evidence has mounted in favor of a critical role of nitric oxide (NO) in numerous functions ranging from neuroendocrine functions to learning and memory. With its participation in multiple systems and action at several levels of integration, NO signaling has a pervasive influence on nervous and endocrine functions. Like blockers of NO synthesis, PCBs and PBDEs produce multifaceted effects on physiological systems. Based on this unique set of converging information it is proposed that organohalogen actions occur, in part, by hijacking processes associated with this ubiquitous bioactive molecule. The current review examines the emerging evidence for NO involvement in selected organohalogen actions and includes recent progress from our laboratory that adds to our current understanding of the actions of organohalogens within hypothalamic neuroendocrine circuits. The thyroid, vasopressin, and reproductive systems as well as processes associated with long-term potentiation were selected as sample targets of organohalogens that rely on regulation by NO. Information is provided about other toxicants with demonstrated interference of NO signaling. Our focus on the convergence between NO system and organohalogen toxicity offers a novel approach to understanding endocrine and neuroendocrine disruption that is particularly problematic for developing organisms. This new working model is proposed as a way to encourage future study in elucidating common mechanisms of action that are selected with a better operational understanding of the systems affected.

Advances in vitreoretinal surgery have included the development and characterization of suitable substitutes for the vitreous. Air, balanced salt solutions, perfluorocarbons, expansile gases, and silicone oil serve integral roles in modern vitreoretinal surgery. Vitreous substitutes vary widely in their properties, serve different clinical functions, and present different shortcomings. Permanent vitreous replacement has been attempted with collagen, hyaluronic acid, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and natural hydrogel polymers. None, however, have proven to be clinically viable. A long-term vitreous substitute remains to be found, and recent research suggests promise in the area of synthetic polymers. Here we review the currently available vitreous substitutes, as well those in the experimental phase. We classify these compounds based on their functionality, composition, and properties. We also discuss the clinical use, advantages, and shortcomings of the various substitutes. In addition we define the ideal vitreous substitute and highlight the need for a permanent substitute with long-term viability and compatibility. Finally, we attempt to define the future role of biomaterials research and the various functions they may serve in the area of vitreous substitutes. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) is a perfluorinated carboxylic chemical (PFC) that has broad applications and distribution in the environment. While many studies have focused on hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity of PFCAs, few have investigated renal toxicity. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we used comparative proteomic and metabonomic technologies to provide a global perspective on renal response to PFDoA. Male rats were exposed to 0, 0.05, 0.2, and 0.5 mg/kg/day of PFDoA for 110 days. After 2-D DIGE and MALDI TOF/TOF analysis, 79 differentially expressed proteins between the control and the PFDoA treated rats (0.2 and 0.5 mg-dosed groups) were successfully identified. These proteins were mainly involved in amino acid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, electron transport, and stress response. Nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabonomic analysis showed an increase in pyruvate, lactate, acetate, choline, and a variety of amino acids in the highest dose group. Furthermore, the profiles of free amino acids in the PFDoA treated groups were investigated quantitatively by high-coverage quantitative iTRAQ-LC MS/MS, which showed levels of sarcosine, asparagine, histidine, 1-methylhistidine, Ile, Leu, Val, Trp, Tyr, Phe, Cys, and Met increased markedly in the 0.5 mg dosed group, while homocitrulline, α-aminoadipic acid, β-alanine, and cystathionine decreased. Conclusion/Significance: These observations provide evidence that disorders in glucose and amino acid metabolism may contribute to PFDoA nephrotoxicity. Additionally, α2u globulin may play an important role in protecting the kidneys from PFDoA toxicity. © 2011 Zhang et al.},

Over the last half century a myriad of interpositional materials have been used in the TMJ but nearly all have been less than successful. The disasters that followed the early use of alloplastic interpositional implants in the 1980s prompted the increased use of autogenous grafts in the 1990s. Whilst studies by the author on the use of dermis-fat grafts have been largely positive, there are still concerns that make the dermis-fat graft a less than ideal interpositional material for use in discectomized joint cavities. In reviewing the literature, it is clear that there is still no ideal interpositional material that satisfies all the criteria for replacement of a missing articular disc following TMJ discectomy. © 2010 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.},

abstract={At military training sites, a variety of pollutants such as hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), may contaminate the area originating from used munitions. Studies investigating the mechanism of toxicity of RDX have shown that it affects the central nervous system causing seizures in humans and animals. Environmental pollutants such as RDX have the potential to affect many different species, therefore it is important to establish how phylogenetically distant species may respond to these types of emerging pollutants. In this paper, we have used a transcriptional network approach to compare and contrast the neurotoxic effects of RDX among five phylogenetically disparate species: rat (Sprague-Dawley), Northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), earthworm (Eisenia fetida), and coral (Acropora formosa). Pathway enrichment analysis indicated a conservation of RDX impacts on pathways related to neuronal function in rat, Northern bobwhite quail, fathead minnows and earthworm, but not in coral. As evolutionary distance increased common responses decreased with impacts on energy and metabolism dominating effects in coral. A neurotransmission related transcriptional network based on whole rat brain responses to RDX exposure was used to identify functionally related modules of genes, components of which were conserved across species depending upon evolutionary distance. Overall, the meta-analysis using genomic data of the effects of RDX on several species suggested a common and conserved mode of action of the chemical throughout phylogenetically remote organisms. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Background: There is significant evidence that continuous and prolonged exposure to several endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) is a risk factor for reduced fertility and fecundity in women. There is also evidence that ED exposure has trans-generational effects. In this systematic review, we evaluate the evidence for an association between EDC exposure and women's reproductive health. Methods: Studies were found by searching the PubMed database for articles published up to 2010. Associations between ED exposure and women's reproductive health reported in the PubMed database are summarized and classified as fertility and fecundity, pregnancy outcomes, transgenerational exposure and effects. Results: Epidemiological studies on EDCs are not always consistent, in part due to limitations imposed by practical constraints. In order to make progress in this field, we recommend taking advantage of biomonitoring and biobanks, including the development of appropriate biomarkers, and taking into greater consideration modulating factors such as genetic polymorphisms and dietary habits. Further human studies are warranted with particular focus on impaired fertility/fecundity associated with currently widespread ED (e.g. bisphenol A, phthalates and polybrominated flame retardants). Conclusions: A detailed appraisal of compounds specifically related to adverse reproductive outcomes is very important for prevention and risk-communication strategies. Besides research needs, the current evidence is sufficient to prompt precautionary actions to protect women's reproductive health. © The Author 2011.

abstract={A study of clutter reduction techniques for detection of metallic and non-metallic (low dielectric constant) targets behind a brick wall with the help of ultra-wideband (UWB) through wall imaging system is presented. It is known that sometimes the clutter level is comparable to the level of target reflection that makes it difficult to detect the target correctly. Detection of low dielectric constant materials becomes more difficult due to low reflection from such targets. Therefore there is a need to analyse various clutter removal techniques and check the performance of these techniques for enhancement of target signal-to-clutter ratio. For this purpose, an UWB stepped frequency wave radar is indigenously assembled with the use of vector network analyser, which works in the frequency range of 3.95-5.85 GHz. An experiment is carried out for detection of metal as well as Teflon (low dielectric constant) targets with the application of clutter reduction techniques. The authors have considered statistical-based techniques like singular value decomposition, principle component analysis, factor analysis and independent component analysis (ICA) for clutter removal. It is observed that the signal-to-clutter ratio for metal target detection is quite enhanced by all the four techniques, whereas only ICA is able to enhance the signal-to-clutter ratio for a low dielectric constant target like Teflon. © 2011 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract={Brominated compounds are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment. The polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants are anthropogenic compounds of concern. Studies suggest that PBDEs can be biotransformed to hydroxylated brominated diphenyl ethers (OH-BDE). However, the rate of OH-BDE formation observed has been extremely small. OH-BDEs have also been identified as natural compounds produced by some marine invertebrates. Another class of compounds, the methoxylated BDEs (MeO-BDEs), has also been identified as natural compounds in the marine environment. Both the OH-BDEs and MeO-BDEs bioaccumulate in higher marine organisms. Recent studies have demonstrated that MeO-BDEs can be biotransformed to OH-BDEs and this generates greater amounts of OH-BDEs than could be generated from PBDEs. Consequently, MeO-BDEs likely represent the primary source of metabolically derived OH-BDEs. Given that for some endpoints OH-BDEs often exhibit greater toxicity compared to PBDEs, it is prudent to consider OH-BDEs as chemicals of concern, despite their seemingly "natural" origins. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The samples were collected from ten monitoring stations including rivers and sea water during the years from 2007 to 2008. The samples were analyzed for 25 parameters: total carbon, total inorganic carbon, total organic carbon, chromium, cadmium, copper, lead, iron, nickel, manganese, phenol, surfactants, ammonium, nitrite and nitrate-nitrogen, total phosphorus, adsorbable organic halogen, sulfate, hardness, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, and salinity. Multivariate statistical techniques, cluster analysis (CA) and factor analysis/principal component analysis (FA/PCA), were applied to analyze the similarities among the sampling sites to identify the source apportionment of pollution parameters in surface waters. The results indicate that seven factors for river water explained 82.24% of the variance. In seawater, seven factors account for 89.65% of the total variance.

abstract={The optimal surgical strategy for the management of ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is still debated. The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis summarizing the evidence favoring one technique over another (repair vs replacement). A search of the English literature in PubMed was performed using 'ischemic mitral regurgitation' and 'repair or replacement or annuloplasty' in the title/abstract field. Articles were excluded if they lacked a direct comparison of repair versus replacement, or used Teflon/pericardial strip or suture annuloplasty in >10% of the repairs. Nine articles were selected for the final analysis. All studies except one were relatively recent (2004-2009). The patient characteristics between treatment groups were similar across studies. All studies excluded patients with degenerative etiology and used a rigorous definition of IMR. Most patients had concomitant coronary artery bypass graft. In the patients with mitral valve replacement, at least the posterior and, in many cases, the entire subvalvular apparatus were preserved. Mean ejection fraction and proportion of patients with severe ventricular dysfunction were similar between the repair and replacement groups. The odds ratios for the studies, comparing replacement to repair, ranged from 0.884 to 17.241 for short-term mortality and the hazard ratios ranged from 0.677 to 3.205 for long-term mortality. There was a significantly increased likelihood of both short-term mortality (summary odds ratio 2.667 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.859-3.817)) and long-term mortality (summary hazard ratio 1.352 (95% CI 1.131-1.618)) for the replacement group compared to the repair group. Based on the meta-analysis of the current relevant literature, mitral valve repair for IMR is associated with better short-term and long-term survival compared to mitral valve replacement. Our conclusion should be interpreted in the context of the inherent limitations of a meta-analysis of retrospective studies including heterogeneity of patient characteristics, which may have influenced the physician's decision to perform mitral valve repair or replacement. In the absence of any published randomized studies, mitral procedure selection should be individualized. © 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.},

Design and methods: Separation was carried out on a C8 column with the mobile phase composed of acetate buffer (pH 4.5) and acetonitrile using theophylline as internal standard. The eluates were monitored by ultraviolet detection with programmed wavelength. Results: Analysis was achieved in less than 8.0. min. The limits of quantification were 3.97 μmol/L, 4.36. nmol/L and 0.421 μmol/L for tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptamine and kynurenine, respectively. Reproducibility and recovery were satisfactory. Twenty healthy adults and 20 uremic patients undergoing hemodialysis were analyzed using the present method. Tryptophan metabolism was found to be disturbed in uremic patients and was improved obviously after hemodialysis. Conclusions: The developed HPLC method is simple, reliable and suitable for monitoring tryptophan metabolism in uremic patients undergoing hemodialysis. © 2010 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.},

abstract={Textile surfaces having high degree of water repellency or hydrophobicity are highly desirable for many applications. Currently, to achieve hydrophobicity, fluorochemicals are widely applied. Unfortunately, fluorochemicals are extremely persistent and bioaccumulative. Substances such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are found widely existed in the environment, in animals, and even in human blood, which causes great concerns to the public. Major fluorochemicals producers will also phase out some of the products in near future. Therefore, in order to produce 'green' and highly effective hydrophobic finishes for textiles, it becomes necessary to explore fluorochemical-free hydrophobic materials. On the other hand, commonly used fluorochemical-free hydrophobic materials such as silicones are significantly inferior to fluorochemicals in terms of degree of water repellency. In order to achieve superhydrophobic surfaces, researchers turned to structures, especially nano- and micro-structures, found in nature for inspiration. Those structures including lotus leaf, Lady's Mantle, and desert beetle, etc. This proceeding firstly provides a critical review of the current state-of-the-art nano- and micro-structure fabrication techniques, their theoretical backgrounds, their advantages and disadvantages. Following the previous work, new methods of achieving superhydrophobic surfaces are reported, including the building of waterdispersible nanocomposites that consist of a silica nanoparticle component and a silicone water repellent component, carbon nanotubes for building a superhydrophobic surface that can repel hot water, and nanosctructures bio-mimicking lotus leaf. These new methods can functionalize textiles and other substrates. While the surface roughness bio-mimick that of the lotus leaf provides nano- or micro-structure, the use of fluorochemicals and silicone component reduces the surface energy so that superior hydrophobicity can be achieved. Among the new methods reported, one is a nonfluorochemical based system and this system is reported in detail. The material synthesis was done through the use of a long-chain aliphatic silane in a transesterification with poly(ethylene glycol). This is followed by the addition of silica nanoparticles with different surface properties to form a nanocomposite sol. The water contact angles (WCA) from the surfaces and textile fabrics treated by the coating of the nanocomposite and its variations were measured, with some samples achieving a larger than 150° WCA. Surface morphology of the nanocomposite treated surface was also examined using SEM.},

abstract={Dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) is a nitrating agent which is receiving increasing interest worldwide on account of the cleanliness of its nitration reactions and the potential of such reactions to offer environmentally-friendly processes for the manufacture of energetic materials-explosives and propellants. A review of this chemistry is timely, the subject having been comprehensively reviewed in 1997, and focuses on work carried out in the United Kingdom in furthering the exploitation of N2O5 nitrations. In particular, the following topics are covered: • N2O5 ring-opening nitrations (synthesis of di-/polynitrate esters and nitraminenitrates)-reviewed/updated • N2O5 selective nitrations (for energetic polymer precursor synthesis)-reviewed/updated • Other N2O5 nitrations (e.g. C-nitro compounds)-reviewed/updated • Nitrodesilylation reactions (synthesis of nitrate esters and nitramines) • Nitrations on solid supports using N2O5 (clays, zeolites and related materials) • Nitrations in alternative solvent systems using N2O5 (perfluorocarbons and perfluoroethers) • Regioselective nitration of toluene and clean nitration of dinitrotoluenes using N2O5 (for environmentally-friendly process for TNT manufacture) • Processes for the scale-up of N2O5 production and the economics of these processes. Some of the above processes are under consideration for the commercial manufacture of explosives, e.g. the toluene nitration processes would eliminate the production of redwater in the manufacture of TNT and are of interest to the US Department of Defense. Many of the other processes are of fundamental importance as they offer novel and clean routes either for the synthesis of the functionalities (C-nitro, nitrate ester, nitramine) which are incorporated into energetic materials, or in some cases actual energetic molecules themselves (e.g. hexanitrofluorene, diglycerol tetranitrate, "Tris-X"-a polynitramine). An additional important product class is nitrate esters of strained-ring molecules (epoxides and oxetanes) for the synthesis of energetic polymer precursors (polyNIMMO and polyGlyN). The process economics for using N2O5 in scaled-up reactions are also discussed. This chapter is in the nature of a review of the use of N2O5 as an environmentallyfriendly nitrating agent and brings the coverage of this topic up to date. It should be of interest to workers in the field of energetic materials synthesis who require a timely survey of this topic. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Seawater samples were collected from the surface, middle and bottom layers, in a grid of 18 stations 25 km apart. The dissolved metals were extracted on-board ship and preconcentrated on-line using Chelex-100 packed in Teflon tubing after filtration of seawater. The particulate metals were digested under microwave heating. Trace metals were analysed using ICP-MS and validated against CASS-4 and MESS-3. The concentration of dissolved and particulate metals were in the range of 0.002-0.194 μg/L and 45-249 μg/g for Cd, 0.04-2.71 μg/L and 21-2885 μg/g for Mn and 0.03-0.49 μg/L and 10-4277 μg/g for Pb respectively. All metals were dominantly in the dissolved phase except Cd which was predominantly in the particulate phase during September 2007. The order of mean log K D found was Cd&gt;Pb&gt;Mn. Positive correlation of log K D with suspended particulate matter were found during both sampling periods except during September 2007, Cd was negatively correlated with suspended particulate matter. The present measurements were to provide baseline data for any future comparison of trace metals distribution in the South China Sea off Southern Terengganu coast. © Universiti Malaysia Terengganu Publisher.},

abstract={Microorganisms can degrade saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes) not only under oxic but also under anoxic conditions. Three denitrifying isolates (strains HxN1, OcN1, HdN1) able to grow under anoxic conditions by coupling alkane oxidation to CO2 with NO3 -reduction to N2 were compared with respect to their alkane metabolism. Strains HxN1 and OcN1, which are both Betaproteobacteria, utilized n-alkanes from C6 to C8 and C8 to C12 respectively. Both activate alkanes anaerobically in a fumarate-dependent reaction yielding alkylsuccinates, as suggested by present and previous metabolite and gene analyses. However, strain HdN1 was unique in several respects. It belongs to the Gammaproteobacteria and was more versatile towards alkanes, utilizing the range from C6 to C30. Neither analysis of metabolites nor analysis of genes in the complete genome sequence of strain HdN1 hinted at fumarate-dependent alkane activation. Moreover, whereas strains HxN1 and OcN1 grew with alkanes and NO3 -, NO2 - or N2O added to the medium, strain HdN1 oxidized alkanes only with NO3 - or NO2 -but not with added N2O; but N2O was readily used for growth with long-chain alcohols or fatty acids. Results suggest that NO2 - or a subsequently formed nitrogen compound other than N2O is needed for alkane activation in strain HdN1. From an energetic point of view, nitrogen-oxygen species are generally rather strong oxidants. They may enable enzymatic mechanisms that are not possible under conditions of sulfate reduction or methanogenesis and thus allow a special mode of alkane activation. © 2010 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Quantitative analysis of the published records of over 400,000 animal bones recovered from 114 archaeological sites from SW Asia and SE Europe from c12 ka to c7.5 ka cal BP (thousands of calibrated radiocarbon years before present) demonstrates significant spatiotemporal variability in faunal exploitation patterns. Sites in the Euphrates region show adoption of domestic taxa by c10.5 ka cal BP, although on average these taxa contribute less than 10% to total assemblage size. This rises to a median of about 40% by c9.5 ka cal BP, and then to about 45% of total NISP by c8.5 ka cal BP. By c10.5 ka in the Tigris and Zagros region domesticates contribute less than 5% to faunal assemblages, but then rise to a median of about 20% by c9.5 ka and 40% by c8.4 ka cal BP. In contrast, Levantine sites have low numbers of domestic taxa (<1%) until c8.8 ka cal BP, when the proportion dramatically increases to a median of about 35%. This apparent delayed-adoption pattern also holds true for the southern Levant, which shows, on average, low levels (<1%) of domestic taxa until 8.8 ka cal BP, at which point domesticates contribute a median of about 10% to assemblages. In the northern parts of SW Asia, the mid- to late-10th millennium cal BP is pivotal, as proportions of domestic taxa show a dramatic increase in frequency during this time, and the 'package' of domestic sheep, goat, cattle and pig becomes more firmly established. This sets the trend for sites of the 9th millennium and the appearance of Neolithic communities in SE Europe from the 8th millennium cal BP onwards, from which point domestic animals are ubiquitous in faunal assemblages. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Changes in the intracellular ratio of ATP/ADP mediate the metabolic regulation of channel activity. The β-cell KATP channel is a hetero-octameric complex composed of two types of subunits: four inward-rectifying potassium channel pore-forming (Kir6.2) subunits and four high-affinity sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunits. Kir6.2 and SUR1 are encoded by the genes KCNJ11 and ABCC8, respectively. Mutations in these genes can result in congenital hyperinsulinism and permanent neonatal diabetes.

abstract={conjugated fluorescent polymers (CPs) such as polyacetylene, polyfluorene, polythiophene and polyphenylene derivatives have unique optical properties, self-assembly performance and regulable structure and properties. They have been used asexcellent optical sensing materials to develop high sensitive and selective sensors by utilizing the large extinction coefficient and high flurescence quantum yield of conjugated polymers, which have been a research hot spot in the field of biosensors. Detection of metal ions based on the conjugated polymer primarily relies on the non- water-soluble conjugated polymers. Metal ions can be detected by investigating the changes of the optical characteristics of the polymers induced by the combination of metal ions with some units such as bipyridyl and crown ethers on the polymer chains. Water solubility ofconjugated polymers can be improved by appending hydrophilic side chains on the main chain of polymer, which provide many new ideas for the design of metal ions biosensors. For example, some biomolecules such as DNA and glucopyranose can be used to design schemes in order to improve the sensitivity and selectivity for the detection of metal ions. This review summarizes the recent progress of highly sensitive detection of heavy metal ions (Hg 2+,Pb2+), transition-metal ions (Cu2+, Ni 2+, Fe3+, Ru3+, Ag+), rare earth element ion (Eu3+), and alkali metal ions (K+, Na +, Li+) based on non-water-soluble and water-soluble conjugated fluorescent polymers.

In this review we present evidence that environmental chemicals, particularly polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and lead, are associated with defcits in many neurobehavioral functions that are also impaired in ADHD. Datas Ources: Human and animal studies of developmental PCB or lead exposures that assessed specifc functional domains shown to be impaired in ADHD children were identifed via searches of PubMed using "lead" or "PCB exposure" in combination with key words, including "attention," "working memory," "response inhibition," "executive function," "cognitive function," "behavior," and "ADHD." Datasynthesis: Children and laboratory animals exposed to lead or PCBs show defcits in many aspects of attention and executive function that have been shown to be impaired in children diagnosed with ADHD, including tests of working memory, response inhibition, vigilance, and alertness. Studies conducted to date suggest that lead may reduce both attention and response inhibition, whereas PCBs may impair response inhibition to a greater degree than attention. Low-level lead exposure has been associated with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD in several recent studies. Similar studies of PCBs have not been conducted. Conclusions: We speculate that exposures to environmental contaminants, including lead and PCBs, may increase the prevalence of ADHD.},

abstract={Purpose The field of tissue engineering focuses on developing strategies for reconstructing injured, diseased, and congenitally absent tissues and organs. During the last decade urologists have benefited from remodeling and regenerative properties of bioscaffolds derived from xenogenic extracellular matrices. We comprehensively reviewed the current literature on structural and functional characteristics of xenogenic extracellular matrix grafting since it was first described in urological surgery. We also reviewed the clinical limitations, and assessed the potential for safe and effective urological application of extracellular matrix grafting in place of autogenous tissue. Materials and Methods We performed literature searches for English language publications using the PubMed® and MEDLINE® databases. Keywords included "xenogenic," "extracellular matrix" and "genitourinary tract applications." A total of 112 articles were scrutinized, of which 50 were suitable for review based on clinical relevance and importance of content. Results Since the mid 1990s xenogenic extracellular matrices have been used to successfully treat a number of pathological conditions that affect the upper and lower genitourinary tract. They are typically prepared from porcine organs such as small intestine and bladder. These organs are harvested and subjected to decellularization and sterilization techniques before surgical implantation. Bioinductive growth factors that are retained during the preparation process induce constructive tissue remodeling as the extracellular matrix is simultaneously degraded and excreted. However, recent documented concerns over durability, decreased mechanical strength and residual porcine DNA after preparation techniques have temporarily hampered the potential of extracellular matrices as a reliable replacement for genitourinary tract structures. Conclusions Extracellular matrices are a useful alternative for successfully treating a number of urological conditions that affect the genitourinary tract. However, clinical concerns regarding mechanical limitations and biosafety need to be addressed before their long-term role in reconstructive urological surgery can be clearly established. © 2010 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.},

abstract={Since the 1988 U.S. ban on ocean dumping of sewage sludge, the majority of these materials are disposed of on land as biosolids. To provide fundamental data for risk assessment concerning the environment, crop plants, and humans, several studies have been conducted that aimed at quantifying the load of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as well as other emerging pollutants of concern in biosolids. So far, two large studies exist that analyzed biosolids samples representing the whole U.S. Both sample sets were collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and analyzed by the same contract laboratory that developed the EPA method 1694 for analysis of PPCPs in biosolids and other matrices. The samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and quantified using isotope dilution as well as conventional use of internal and external standards. The present meta analysis scrutinizes the findings and approaches of the two studies and puts them in context to potential environmental risks that should be considered. Both the EPA's Targeted National Sewage Sludge Survey (TNSSS) and the analysis of a comparable sample set collected in 2001 revealed concentrations of several antimicrobials and antibiotics in the mg kg-1 dry weight range. Prevalent contaminants were triclocarban, triclosan, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, followed by a number of tetracycline antibiotics. A comparison of the two datasets and study designs showed that combining a large number of individual samples to mega-composite samples is a suitable approach for identifying prevalent contaminants and for obtaining representative mean concentrations. Whereas the use of mega composite samples can result in significant time and cost savings, this study design strategy tends to yield lower numbers of total analytes detected, lower detection frequencies for individual analytes and it limits the detection of spatial (geographical) patterns in analyte occurrence. The findings of both nationwide studies provide a critical data basis for future risk assessment concerning the safety of biosolids application on agricultural and recreational land. Risks of primary concern identified in this work are the promotion of antibiotic resistance in the environment, adverse effects on soil microbial communities and plants, as well as the possibility of direct exposure of consumers to antibiotic residues contained in food crops grown on biosolids amended fields.. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

Our aim was to conduct a systematic review to investigate the strength of evidence for an association between anterior knee pain (AKP) in younger adults and subsequent PFOA. Methods. The search strategy included electronic databases (Pubmed, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane, PEDro, SportDiscus: inception to December 2009), reference lists of potentially eligible studies and selected reviews. Full text articles in any language, - identified via English titles and abstracts, were included if they were retrospective or prospective in design and contained quantitative data regarding structural changes indicative of PFOA, incident to original idiopathic AKP. Eligibility criteria were applied to titles, abstracts and full-texts by two independent reviewers. Data extraction included study location, design, date, sampling procedure, sample characteristics, AKP/PFOA definitions, follow-up duration and rate, and main findings. Foreign language articles were translated into English prior to examination. Results. Seven articles satisfied eligibility (5 English, 2 German). Only one case-control study directly investigated a link between PFOA and prior AKP, providing level 3b evidence in favour of an association (OR 4.4; 95%CI 1.8, 10.6). Rough estimates of the annual risk of PFOA from the remaining six small, uncontrolled, observational studies (mean follow-up range: 5.7 to 23 years) ranged from 0% to 3.4%. This was not the primary aim of these studies, and limitations in design and methodology mean this data should be interpreted with caution. Conclusions. There is a paucity of high-quality evidence reporting a link between AKP and PFOA. Further, well-designed cohort studies may be able to fill this evidence gap. © 2010 Thomas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Abstract. Background. Cysteine has a crucial role in cellular physiology and its synthesis is tightly controlled due to its reactivity. However, little is known about the sulfur metabolism and its regulation in clostridia compared with other firmicutes. In Clostridium perfringens, the two-component system, VirR/VirS, controls the expression of the ubiG operon involved in methionine to cysteine conversion in addition to the expression of several toxin genes. The existence of links between the C. perfringens virulence regulon and sulfur metabolism prompted us to analyze this metabolism in more detail. Results. We first performed a tentative reconstruction of sulfur metabolism in C. perfringens and correlated these data with the growth of strain 13 in the presence of various sulfur sources. Surprisingly, C. perfringens can convert cysteine to methionine by an atypical still uncharacterized pathway. We further compared the expression profiles of strain 13 after growth in the presence of cystine or homocysteine that corresponds to conditions of cysteine depletion. Among the 177 genes differentially expressed, we found genes involved in sulfur metabolism and controlled by premature termination of transcription via a cysteine specific T-box system (cysK-cysE, cysP1 and cysP2) or an S-box riboswitch (metK and metT). We also showed that the ubiG operon was submitted to a triple regulation by cysteine availability via a T-box system, by the VirR/VirS system via the VR-RNA and by the VirX regulatory RNA. In addition, we found that expression of pfoA (theta-toxin), nagL (one of the five genes encoding hyaluronidases) and genes involved in the maintenance of cell redox status was differentially expressed in response to cysteine availability. Finally, we showed that the expression of genes involved in [Fe-S] clusters biogenesis and of the ldh gene encoding the lactate dehydrogenase was induced during cysteine limitation. Conclusion. Several key functions for the cellular physiology of this anaerobic bacterium were controlled in response to cysteine availability. While most of the genes involved in sulfur metabolism are regulated by premature termination of transcription, other still uncharacterized mechanisms of regulation participated in the induction of gene expression during cysteine starvation. © 2010 André et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Copolymerization of acrylates and styrene (St) with perfluorooctylacyloxyethyl methacrylate (FA) monomer, prepared from the reaction of perfluorooctanoic acid and hydroxymethyl methacrylate, was carried out by solution polymerization. The fluorinated acrylate and St copolymers (PFA) were examined by GPC, FT-IR, and 1H NMR. The surface tension of the PFA solution in N-methyl pyrrolidone was tested by the drop volume method. The results showed that the surface tension of the PFA solution decreased in exponential decay with increase of the PFA concentration, and the surface tension of the solution also decreased with increased addition of the FA monomer in the copolymer at the same concentration. Meanwhile, the adsorption of the PFA macromolecules in the air-solution interface increased and enrichment of the fluorinated segments on the solution surface occurred. The studies of the surface free energy, polarity, fluorine content, and morphology of the PFA films illustrated that the surface free energy and polarity of the PFA films were decreased with the augment of the FA monomer in the copolymers, and that the fluorine content and the surface roughness were increased. The surface free energy of the PFA film was as small as 16.6 mN·m-1. The surface properties of the PFA copolymers obtained by one shot feed during polymerization were superior to those obtained by continuing feed procedure. More fluorine segregation occurred and induced the formation of a fluorine-enriched surface if the PFA copolymer was postheated. The posttreatment was thus beneficial to the improvement of the surface properties of the PFA film. Copyright © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Introduction: Following trauma, patients may suffer an overwhelming pro-inflammatory response and immune paralysis resulting in infection and multiple organ failure (MOF). Various potentially immunomodulative interventions have been tested. The objective of this study is to systematically review the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigate the effect of potentially immunomodulative interventions in comparison to a placebo or standard therapy on infection, MOF, and mortality in trauma patients.Methods: A computerized search of MEDLINE, the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE yielded 502 studies, of which 18 unique RCTs were deemed relevant for this study. The methodological quality of these RCTs was assessed using a critical appraisal checklist for therapy articles from the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine. The effects of the test interventions on infection, MOF, and mortality rates and inflammatory parameters relative to the controls were recorded.Results: In most studies, the inflammatory parameters differed significantly between the test and control groups. However, significant changes in infection, MOF, and mortality rates were only measured in studies testing immunoglobulin, IFN-γ, and glucan.Conclusions: Based on level 1b and 2b studies, administration of immunoglobulin, IFN-γ, or glucan have shown the most promising results to improve the outcome of trauma patients. © 2010 Spruijt et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Abstract: Each year approximately 170,000 patients are diagnosed with brain metastasis in the United States, making this the most common intracranial tumor in adults. Historically, treatment strategies focused on the use of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for palliation, yielding a median survival time of only 3 to 6 months. The possible effect of WBRT on cognitive function has generated much concern and debate regarding the use of this modality. Thus, the use of WBRT alone, or in conjunction with other treatment modalities should take into account both risks and benefits, to ensure the best patient outcome with regard to disease state and functional status. The advent of technologies permitting local dose-escalation have clearly increased local control rates, and in select patients, even survival, thereby, further intensifying the debate regarding the use of WBRT. Here, we review the use of WBRT, radiosurgery, and resection for the treatment of brain metastases. Further, we will review the use of radiation sensitizers and blood- brain barrier penetrating cytotoxics such as temozolomide. Finally, we will discuss current treatment strategies for possibly maintaining and improving cognitive function for these patients. © 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={Reproductive function and fertility are thought to be compromised by behaviors such as cigarette smoking, substance abuse, and alcohol consumption; however, the strength of these associations are uncertain. Furthermore, the reproductive system is thought to be under attack from exposure to environmental contaminants, particularly those chemicals shown to affect endocrine homeostasis. The relationship between exposure to environmental contaminants and adverse effects on human reproductive health are frequently debated in the scientific literature and these controversies have spread into the lay press drawing increased public and regulatory attention. Therefore, the objective of the present review was to critically evaluate the literature concerning the relationship between lifestyle exposures and adverse effects on fertility as well as examining the evidence for a role of environmental contaminants in the purported decline of semen quality and the pathophysiology of subfertility, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and endometriosis. The authors conclude that whereas cigarette smoking is strongly associated with adverse reproductive outcomes, high-level exposures to other lifestyle factors are only weakly linked with negative fertility impacts. Finally, there is no compelling evidence that environmental contaminants, at concentrations representative of the levels measured in contemporary biomonitoring studies, have any effect, positive or negative, on reproductive health in the general population. Further research using prospective study designs with robust sample sizes are needed to evaluate testable hypotheses that address the relationship between exposure and adverse reproductive health effects. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.},

abstract={Just as the world we inherited today, is what our past generation left on us, the future generations would inherit the legacy we leave for them. Water is essential for life on earth. Water is a unique liquid, without it, life as we know is impossible. Water the "Elixir of Life" is facing a severe threat due to pollution. Water, due to its great solvent power, is constantly threatened to get polluted easily. The requirement of water in all forms of lives, from micro-organisms to man, is a serious problem today because all water resources have been reached to a point of crisis due to unplanned urbanization and industrialization. The topic of our concern here is pollution of wetland. Heavy metals constitute an important group of environmentally hazardous substances. During this century, many wetlands in Iran have received elevated inputs of heavy metals as a result of an increase in various activities. Municipal and industrial discharges, urban storm-water runoff, and agricultural drainage can result in trace metals, nutrients, pesticides, and organic wastes being transported into aquatic ecosystems. In aquatic ecosystems, contaminants are often rapidly removed from the water column via sorption processes. Given that trace metals are not subjected to degradation processes, they tend to accumulate in benthic sediments. However, trace metals are not necessarily fixed permanently to sediments; rather they may be remobilized via chemical, physical, and biological processes. The pollution of aquatic ecosystems by trace metals is a significant problem as trace metals constitute some of the most hazardous substances that can bio-accumulate. Metals that are deposited in the aquatic environment may accumulate in the food chain and cause ecological damage while also posing a risk to human health. Human activities have lead to accumulation of toxic metals in the aquatic sediments. Sediments and suspended particulate matters (SPM) of aquatic environment have an important role in adsorption of dissolved heavy metals, although they can be a potential source of metal pollution by releasing adsorbed metals during changing physical-chemical characteristics of the aquatic environment. Since concentrations of most heavy metals in river waters are very low and subject to highly variations during a year, sediments and SPM are good indicators of metal pollution in the river environment. In the recent year more attention has been paid to the aquatic environment. These environments are being polluted by various sources including sewages from residential, agricultural and industrial sectors. Sediments of aquatic environment act as a major reservoir of metals and also as a source of contaminants. Enrichment of heavy metals due to industrialization and urbanization was recorded in sediments of coastal seas all over the world. The monitoring of metal contents from anthropogenic activities is particularly important for the assessment of environmental quality and protection. Metal distributions in lagoon and intertidal sediments have frequently been used to investigate chronological inputs and spatial distribution of contaminants. Enrichment of heavy metals, radio nuclides and radioactive pollutants is recorded in sediments of coastal areas like Bombay, Goa and Cochin because of industrialization. In view of this, the present study is taken up to estimate the metal concentrations in the Bamdedj wetland. The present study deals with the spatial and temporal variations of trace metal contents, their controlling factors and an assessment of the pollution levels in the surficial sediments. The study focuses to test the hypothesis that concentrations of metals subject to anthropogenic inputs would increase in recent sediments as urbanization of the watershed continued to increase. As is well known, elements can be divided into two categories based on their biological roles, i.e. essential (or biophilous), and non-essential. The first type of elements includes a large group of metals (such as Co, Cr, Cu, Zn, etc.) which are functionally necessary for living organisms in small concentrations; however, at high levels they become toxic by interfering with necessary biochemical functions. The non-essential category of elements includes chalcophile elements such as Pb, Cd, Hg and As, which are extremely toxic and represent a serious danger to living organisms. Subsequently amongst organic and inorganic pollutants, most of the research prefers to study the inorganic pollutants due to the ease of measurements. In the present study we have tried to measure heavy metals such as Ni, Cd, Pb, Zn, As and Hg along with Ca and Fe. For these purpose the six sediment samples were collected from Bamdedj marsh in the province of Khuzestan. Most trace metals tend to enrich in the modern organic sediments rather than inorganic sediments. Chemical bonds of metals in sediments and SPM is an important factor in detecting pollution in the particulate phase of the river. Many sequential extraction and chemical partitioning methods have been developed and applied for determination of metal bonding and pollution detection in particulate phase. It is believed that metals in adsorbed, carbonate, sulfide and organic bonds are more related to pollution and have higher risk of bioavailability and contamination of the environment. The marsh sediments, which were brown to black in color, were air-dried and passed through a 63-um mesh (equivalent to a No. 230 sieve, ASTM E-11). The sieved sediment was powdered using an agate mortar and pestle. About 0.5 g of the powdered sample was placed in a Teflon beaker containing 10 mL aqua regia. The mixture was heated until most of the liquid had evaporated, and allowed to cool before 5 mL of hydrogen fluoride (HF) were added. The samples were further cooled to room temperature before being filtered. The filtrates were transferred to 50 mL volumetric flasks and brought to volume with 1 N HCl. Chemical partition studies were conducted in four sequential steps: (1) acetic acid 25%v/v, (2) acetic acid 25% v/v-0.1 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride, (3) 30% H202 "extraction with 1 M ammonium acetate" and (4) hot 50% HCl. Trace metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Ca, Fe and Al) were measured using a UNICAM flame atomic absorption spectrometer. Calibration curves were established using known standards. Procedural blanks and duplicates were run alongside the samples as part of the quality assurance program. The analytical accuracy was approximately ±3% for all elements. A standard sample (MESS-1) was analyzed using the same methods as an accuracy check. The Weighted Pair Group method (GWP) was used to identify clustering tendencies among the samples. To assess the intensity of metal contamination in Shur River sediments, the geochemical accumulation index was calculated using: I geo=Log2[Cn/Bn*1.5] Where Igeo is the geochemical accumulation index, Cn is the sediment metal concentration and Bn is the metal concentration in the shale The results of cluster analysis (Fig. 1) show that Hg and as are originated from organic sources as they form cluster "D" with LOI at a meaningful similarity coefficient. On the other hand one may conclude that Ni is mainly originated from lithogenic source since it forms cluster "B" with Fe at a significant similarity coefficient. It seems that Pb is mainly originated from biogenic source since it has developed a highly significant similarity coefficient with Ca in cluster "A". The source of Zn and Cd (cluster C) cannot be furnished through cluster analysis. The results of geochemical studies show various concentrations for studies metals. While using Igeo index, we noticed that Hg fall within the category of "high pollution" in sediments of Bamdedj marsh. This is clearly evident through bulk chemical analysis as well as chemical partitioning studies. The elements such as Fe and Zn fall within "no pollution" class. Therefore, we can suggest a lithogenous source for Zn. Through cluster analysis we could not bring out a proper source for Zn but combination of chemical analysis and cluster analysis can show a better means of interpretation of data. It should be pointed out cadmium falls within "medium pollution" class according to geochemical index. Figure Presented Fig. 1: Cluster analysis for studied metals in Bamdedj marsh sediment It seems that a great portion of metals have been incorporated into the sediments through usage of agricultural fertilizers that are being widely used by farmers. It can be concluded that agricultural activities are the major source for distribution of metals in Bamdedj sediments since there are not any industrial activities in the vicinity of marsh. It should be pointed out that sewages from residential sector can also contribute to the metal pollution in marsh. The presence of Ca in loosely bonded ions can be attributed to the nature of Ca to dissociate from contaminant sources at lower pHs. A higher pollution. Herewith, we suggest that Environmental Planning Management (EMP) should be prepared to monitor the pollution in marsh from time to time. The EMP should be simple with minimum parameters (such as Hg as an indicator) and the period of measurement should be feasible and economical. Also the future studies should focus on sediment and water interaction to know about the risk assessment of metals in dissolved form. On the other hand, the bio-availability of the metals should be examined in the sediments to possible know about the risk of transfer of metals into the aquatic life of marsh.},

abstract={Background: Cotton fibers (produced by Gossypium species) are the premier natural fibers for textile production. The two tetraploid species, G. barbadense (Gb) and G. hirsutum (Gh), differ significantly in their fiber properties, the former having much longer, finer and stronger fibers that are highly prized. A better understanding of the genetics and underlying biological causes of these differences will aid further improvement of cotton quality through breeding and biotechnology. We evaluated an inter-specific Gh × Gb recombinant inbred line (RIL) population for fiber characteristics in 11 independent experiments under field and glasshouse conditions. Sites were located on 4 continents and 5 countries and some locations were analyzed over multiple years.Results: The RIL population displayed a large variability for all major fiber traits. QTL analyses were performed on a per-site basis by composite interval mapping. Among the 651 putative QTLs (LOD > 2), 167 had a LOD exceeding permutation based thresholds. Coincidence in QTL location across data sets was assessed for the fiber trait categories strength, elongation, length, length uniformity, fineness/maturity, and color. A meta-analysis of more than a thousand putative QTLs was conducted with MetaQTL software to integrate QTL data from the RIL and 3 backcross populations (from the same parents) and to compare them with the literature. Although the global level of congruence across experiments and populations was generally moderate, the QTL clustering was possible for 30 trait x chromosome combinations (5 traits in 19 different chromosomes) where an effective co-localization of unidirectional (similar sign of additivity) QTLs from at least 5 different data sets was observed. Most consistent meta-clusters were identified for fiber color on chromosomes c6, c8 and c25, fineness on c15, and fiber length on c3.Conclusions: Meta-analysis provided a reliable means of integrating phenotypic and genetic mapping data across multiple populations and environments for complex fiber traits. The consistent chromosomal regions contributing to fiber quality traits constitute good candidates for the further dissection of the genetic and genomic factors underlying important fiber characteristics, and for marker-assisted selection. © 2010 Lacape et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: This article reviews the evidence for generational differences in work values from time-lag studies (which can separate generation from age/career stage) and cross-sectional studies (which cannot). Understanding generational shifts is especially important given the coming retirement of Baby Boomer workers and their replacement by those born after 1982 (GenMe/GenY/Millennials). Findings: Most studies, including the few time-lag studies, show that GenX and especially GenMe rate work as less central to their lives, value leisure more, and express a weaker work ethic than Boomers and Silents. Extrinsic work values (e.g., salary) are higher in GenMe and especially GenX. Contrary to popular conceptions, there were no generational differences in altruistic values (e.g., wanting to help others). Conflicting results appeared in desire for job stability, intrinsic values (e.g., meaning), and social/affiliative values (e.g., making friends). GenX, and especially GenMe are consistently higher in individualistic traits. Overall, generational differences are important where they appear, as even small changes at the average mean that twice or three times as many individuals score at the top of the distribution. Implications: To recruit GenMe, companies should focus on work-life balance issues and flexible schedules. Programs based on volunteering, altruistic values, social values, or meaning in work will likely be no more successful than they were for previous generations. The lack of generational differences in job hopping suggests that GenMe workers who are satisfied will be retained. Originality/value: No previous review has summarized all of the available studies examining generational differences in work values. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

abstract={Single-phase β-FeSi2 films have been prepared by Fe-Si mixed targets in a facing target sputtering (FTS) system. Compared with depositing iron on silicon, co-sputtering of Fe and Si atoms in as-deposited samples guarantees that Fe and Si atoms only need relative low energy via short distance migration to form iron silicide during the annealing process, which helps decreasing annealing temperature and reducing annealing time. Then pure single-phase β-FeSi2 films can be obtained at a low annealing temperature 600 °C in this instance. By adjusting the sputtering areas of Fe and Si targets, it's convenient to control the Fe/Si atom ratios in as-deposited samples and thus p-type and n-type films can be obtained easily. The best n-type β-FeSi2 film on Si(111) substrate shows an electron concentration of 1.7×1016 cm-3 and a Hall mobility of 488cm2/Vs, respectively.

abstract={Elemental Carbon (EC) is an important component of Particulate Matter (PM) and, when determined by optical method, it is usually referred as Black Carbon (BC). Teflon (PTFE®) membranes are very appropriate for gravimetric and compositional analyses of PM and 47 mm filters with 2 μm pores are very often used to collect PM samples on daily basis. We describe here a simple, non-destructive, optical method to measure, on the PTFE filters routinely used for PM studies, the BC content basically without any sizeable extra-cost. This gives the opportunity to measure in each sample the concentration of: total PM by gravimetric analysis, metals by, for instance, X-Ray Fluorescence, major ions by Ion Chromatography and BC. All these pieces of information can therefore be obtained with just one filter and with the sureness to analyze the same PM. Time series of such data are the basic input to source apportionment methods by receptor models. Furthermore, this approach also allows the analysis of particular samples as those collected by multistage cascade impactors and thus it provides information on the BC size distribution. © Società Italiana di Fisica.},

abstract={Triclosan (2,4,4′-trichloro-2′-hydroxy-diphenyl ether) is an antibacterial compound that has been used in consumer products for about 40 years. The tolerability and safety of triclosan has been evaluated in human volunteers with little indication of toxicity or sensitization. Although information in humans from chronic usage of personal care products is not available, triclosan has been extensively studied in laboratory animals. When evaluated in chronic oncogenicity studies in mice, rats, and hamsters, treatment-related tumors were found only in the liver of male and female mice. Application of the Human Relevance Framework suggested that these tumors arose by way of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) activation, a mode of action not considered to be relevant to humans. Consequently, a Benchmark Dose (BMDL10) of 47mg/kg/day was developed based on kidney toxicity in the hamster. Estimates of the amount of intake from in the use of representative personal care products for men, women, and children were derived in two ways: (1) using known or assumed triclosan levels in various consumer products and assumed usage patterns (product-based estimates); and (2) using upper bound measured urinary triclosan levels from human volunteers (biomonitoring-based estimates) using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the product-based estimates, the margin of safety (MOS) for the combined exposure estimates of intake from the use of all triclosan-containing products considered were approximately 1000, 730, and 630 for men, women, and children, respectively. The MOS calculated from the biomonitoring-based estimated intakes were 5200, 6700, and 11,750 for men, women, and children, respectively. Based on these results, exposure to triclosan in consumer products is not expected to cause adverse health effects in children or adults who use these products as intended. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Despite increased demand for disclosure of physician and researcher financial ties (FTs) to industry, little is known about patients', research participants', or journal readers' attitudes toward FTs. Methods: We systematically reviewed original, quantitative studies of patients', research participants', or journal readers' views about FTs to pharmaceutical and medical device companies. The MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge databases were searched for English-language studies containing original, quantitative data on attitudes toward FTs. We screened 6561 citations and retrieved 244 potentially eligible abstracts. Of these, 20 met inclusion criteria. Results: Eleven studies assessed FTs and perceptions of quality. In clinical care, patients believed FTs decreased the quality and increased the cost of care. In research, FTs affected perceptions of study quality. In 2 studies, readers' perceptions of journal article quality decreased after disclosure of FTs. Eight studies assessed the acceptability of FTs. Patients were more likely to view personal gifts to physicians as unacceptable, compared with professional gifts. In 6 of the 10 studies that assessed the importance of disclosure, most patients and research participants believed FTs should be disclosed; in the other 4, approximately one-quarter believed FTs should be disclosed. Among the 7 studies assessing willingness to participate in research, approximately one-quarter of participants reported less willingness after disclosure of FTs. Conclusions: Patients believe that FTs influence professional behavior and should be disclosed. Patients, physicians, and research participants believe FTs decrease the quality of research evidence, and, for some, knowledge of FTs would affect willingness to participate in research. ©2010 American Medical Association.

abstract={We developed the use of a porous iron pellet as a catalyst for AMS 14C analysis of small samples down to ultra-microscale size (10-25 μgC). It resulted in increased and more stable beam currents through our HVEE 4130 14C AMS system, which depend smoothly on the sample size. We find that both the expected decrease of oxalic acid standards and increase of backgrounds with decreasing sample size, due to increasing influence of contamination, are reproducible. Using a mass-dependent background correction for dead (1.0 ± 0.4 μgC) and modern (0.25 ± 0.10 μgC) contamination, we obtain reliable results for small samples down to 10 μgC and possibly smaller. Due to our low graphitization yield for ultra-small samples (increases from 40% to 80% on average with sample size), we measured graphite standards as small as 3 μgC. The standard deviation of the corrected activity is about 5% for a 10-μgC HOxII standard. Here we report the iron pellet technique, which is new to the best of our knowledge. It is generally applicable for AMS 14C laboratories that want to measure small samples down to ultra-microscale size. As an illustrative test-case, we analyze 14C data for IAEA-C5, C7 and C8 samples with masses ranging from 15 to 300 μgC. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: The present work concerns the distribution of ten heavy metals (Sb, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in the surrounding agricultural soils of the world largest antimony (Sb) mine in China. The objective is to explore the degree and spatial distribution of heavy metal pollution of the Sb mine-affected agricultural soils. The presented data were compared with metal concentrations in soils from mining and smelting sites in China and other countries. Materials and methods: There were 29 environmental samples in all that were collected in the year 2008 for this study. Soil characteristic parameters such as pH, total organic carbon, and cation exchange capacity were determined. Metal contents were determined after digestion in a Teflon bomb with aqua regia. Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. As, Sb, and Hg concentrations were determined by atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS-2202). Fe, Al, Cr, and Mn concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. Results and discussion: Almost all of the ten heavy metals exhibited much higher concentrations compared with their respective natural background values, especially Sb, and they varied with sampling site. The enriched factor values show that Sb (235.8), Cd (51.8), Hg (13.8), As (3.13), Zn (2.91), Pb (2.46), and Cr (1.67) are significantly accumulated in the study area. All of the integrated pollution indexes (IPI > 3) calculated from pollution indexes show that the soils are severely contaminated by investigated heavy metals. Principal component analysis, cluster analysis, and correlation analysis suggest that Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, and Mn are derived from the sulfide mineralization paragenesis in Xikuangshan area. Cr, As, Hg, Al, and Sb are mainly due to the mining and smelting activities of this area and derived from organic matters, and Ni is mainly generated from agricultural activities. These metal concentrations in Xikuangshan agricultural topsoil are comparable or within the ranges of those in mine areas of other countries. Conclusions: The heavy metal concentrations in the topsoil of Xikuangshan area are mostly higher than the background values, especially for Sb and As. Heavy metal pollution has spread in this mine area, both from mining activities and agricultural activities. Analysis of soil samples from 23 sampling locations of the area show significant spatial variation of the ten heavy metals. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Unlike the rouging observed for stainless steel pipes, the fast degradation of the rupture disc was caused by a crevice corrosion environment created by perforations in the protective Teflon coating.

abstract={This review article provides a critical overview of several different synthetic approaches developed for asymmetric preparation of fluorine-containing amines, amino alcohols, α- and β-amino acids. The common feature of these methods is the application of sulfinyl group as a chiral auxiliary to control the stereochemical outcome of the reactions under study. In particular, the following general methods are critically discussed: diastereoselective methylene transfer from diazomethane to the carbonyl of β-keto-γ-fluoroalkyl sulfoxides as a general approach for preparation of various α-fluoroalkyl α-sulfinylalkyl oxiranes. The resulting compounds were used as true chiral synthons for their further elaboration via oxidative or reductive desulfurization, to numerous fluorine-containing and biologically relevant amino- and hydroxy-containing derivatives. Another general approaches discussed here are asymmetric additions to C{double bond, long}N double bond. One of them is addition of chiral sulfoxide stabilized carbon nucleophiles to fluorine-containing imines, leading to convenient preparation of alpha-fluoroalkyl derivatives of alpha amino acids and amines. Another approach is asymmetric Reformatsky reaction between N-sulfinyl imines and ethyl bromodifluoroacetate allowing operationally convenient preparation of α,α-difluoro-β-amino acids in enantiomerically pure form. Finally, structurally similar but mechanistically different addition reactions of diethyl difluoromethylphosphonate to N-sulfinyl imines, as a general approach to asymmetric synthesis of α,α-difluoro-β-aminophosphonates and phosphonic acids, are discussed. Effect of fluorine on the mechanism and stereochemical outcome of these reactions is discussed in detail and compared, where it is possible, with that of the analogous reactions of fluorine-free substrates. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={As a consequence of substantial, long-term usage, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have contaminated humans, wildlife, and abiotic matrices around the world. Although several reports have reviewed PBDE contamination in general, none have focused specifically on birds. Birds have long been recognized as invaluable monitoring species for organohalogen contamination. This review summarizes most available PBDE data in birds and emphasizes several specific aspects, i.e., inter-regional differences in PBDE contamination, the extent of BDE-209 contamination, differences in congener composition patterns between piscivorous and terrestrial-feeding birds, trophic biomagnification and temporal changes in PBDE contamination. A meta-analysis of PBDE congener profiles reveals distinctly different patterns between birds utilizing terrestrial and aquatic food webs. Terrestrial-feeding birds appear to exhibit heightened Deca-BDE contamination. Inter-regional comparisons reveal elevated PBDE burdens in North American aquatic birds compared to those from the rest of the world, likely related to greater Penta-BDE demand there. Examination of North American and Chinese terrestrial birds also exhibited some of the highest BDE-209 concentrations ever reported in wildlife, and suggested that urban environments in general and some commercial activities (e.g., electronic recycling) may increase exposure of wildlife and humans to Deca-BDE. Summaries of temporal trend studies suggest that varying usage histories and regulations have influenced PBDE contamination patterns at different regions. As a consequence of continued usage of Deca-BDE around the world, significant increases in BDE-209 burdens have been observed in both North American and European birds. Examination of both wild and laboratory-exposed birds also indicated potential degradation of BDE-209 to less brominated, but more bioavailable/toxic congeners. Therefore, it would be wise to reduce releases of Deca-BDE, the only PBDE formulation remaining in production, to the environment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Results of multi-media monitoring studies were compiled and discussed to provide in-depth understanding on various issues of dioxins and organohalogen contamination in both ambient environment and animals including humans. Prominent contaminations were found in the regions where they have been heavily used. The eastern Asian region is probably a potential source of pollution, particularly by the new contaminants such as polybrominated diphenyls ethers. These groups of contaminants, together with polychlorinated biphenyls, exhibited either decreasing or increasing trends depending on the extent of industrialization in Asian developing region, indicating the necessity for long term monitoring. The open dumping sites for municipal wastes in major cities are significant sources of many toxic chemicals, and these areas are probably one of the challenges for future research due to the long term impacts on the environmental quality and human health. The formation of dioxins and related compounds in such dumping sites and their elevated residues found in breast milk of residents living in and around warrant long term impacts of dioxins upon next generations. Comprehensive and long term monitoring programs are urgently needed with close collaboration and proper capacity building in Asian developing countries in order to mitigate dioxin and organohalogen emission and their risk on ecosystems and human health. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={There are a number of reports in the literature which describe the occurrence of so-called emerging pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, in surface water. Few of these studies have reported values from large cities in relatively arid areas, such as in Spain. The persistence of some pharmaceuticals to usual wastewater treatments allows their discharge into surface waters. It is increasingly evident that mental health problems are of special concern for public health since psychiatric drugs are used in large amounts. Compared to other countries, Spain has a high pharmaceutical consumption rate, and Madrid metropolitan area is one of the most densely populated areas in Europe. The aim of the present study was to determine the presence of different psychoactive pharmaceuticals and metabolites in the main rivers of Madrid metropolitan area: Jarama, Manzanares, Guadarrama, Henares and Tajo. Sampling was done downstream of ten sewage treatment plants (STP) discharging into these rivers. Control points upstream of STPs discharge points were also sampled. Pharmaceutical compounds and metabolites for analysis were selected according to human consumption and prescription rates in Madrid, and the availability of valid techniques for detection. We observed residues of the antidepressants fluoxetine (80% of the sampling sites), citalopram (60%) and venlafaxine (100%), the anxiolytics nordiazepam (90%), oxazepam (80%) and 7-aminoflunitrazepam (10%) and the anticonvulsant carabamazepine (70%). Measured concentrations equalled or exceeded those reported for other geographical areas, although there is a pronounced lack of information for the anxiolytics and venlafaxine. This is of special concern given that Wyeth-Ayerst's venlafaxine, Effexor, was the 10th greatest selling pharmaceutical worldwide in 2006. We conclude that the origin of pharmaceutical pollution in the rivers of Madrid is mainly the discharge of sewage treatment plants in Madrid's metropolitan area and a comprehensive monitoring program should be implemented. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Liquid-liquid segmented flows in microchannels fabricated on polymer test chips were investigated experimentally. Polymer test chips were prepared using hot embossing of polycarbonate (PC) sheets with micro-milled brass mold inserts. Three different configurations of microchannels were prepared with injection to test channels expansion ratios of 16, 4 and 2 and a fixed test channel geometry. Deionized water with blue food-coloring dye (1% v/v) was used as a dispersed fluid at flow rates (QD) between 0.5 and 60 μl/min. The carrier fluid was perfluorocarbon (FC 3283) with nonionic fluorous-soluble surfactant (Perfluorooctanol, 10% v/v) at flow rates (QC) between 3 and 25 μ1/min. The two fluids were injected separately into the chips. Droplet and Plug flows with transient Irregular Segmented flows between two flow regimes were mainly observed in the test channels of the three different chips. Flow pattern maps and transitions between flow regimes were determined in terms of a fixed homogeneous carrier fluid volumetric flow ratio (βC) to compare the effect of the expansion ratios from the injection to the test channels. The droplet and plug regimes were shifted to higher carrier and lower dispersed fluid superficial velocities and the plug flow regime was broader with the lower expansion ratio channels. The transient irregular segmented flow was favored in the higher expansion channel ratio and the interval of transient irregular segmented flow between droplet and plug flow regimes were shorter for the low expansion channel ratios. This is evidence that flow regime maps in micro-channels are not universal and depend on the configuration part of the microinjection system. The length of the dispersed segmented flows and the distance between consecutive droplets or plugs as a function of βC were determined by image processing of frames acquired via CCD camera with bright field illumination. The average length of the dispersed fluid was shown to scale approximately with βC to the -1.2 power. Velocities of the dispersed droplet and plug flows were measured using double-pulsed laser illumination and were found to be 1.25 ± 0.049 and 1.46 ± 0.077 times faster than the superficial velocity of the segmented flow respectively. Two-phase pressure drop measurements were also carried out for all flow regimes and associated trends were correlated with changes in flow topology. Comparisons of experimental pressure drop with the predictions for a modified Lockhart-Martinelli correlation were also made. Copyright © 2009 by ASME.},

abstract={The discovery of fullerenes in 1985 has ushered in an explosive growth in the applications of engineered nanomaterials and consumer products. Nanotechnology and engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are being incorporated into a range of commercial products such as consumer electronics, cosmetics, imaging and sensors. Nanomaterials offer new possibilities for the development of novel sensing and monitoring technologies. Nanosensors can be classified under two main categories: (i) Nanotechnology-enabled sensors or sensors that are themselves nanoscale or have nanoscale materials or components, and (ii) Nanoproperty-quantifiable sensors or sensors that are used to measure nanoscale properties. The first category can eventually result in lower material cost, reduced weight and energy consumption. The second category can enhance our understanding of the potential toxic effects of emerging pollutants from nanomaterials including fullerenes, dendrimers, and carbon nanotubes. Despite the enormous literatures and reviews on Category I sensors, there are few sensors to measure nanoscale properties or sensors belonging to Category II. This class of nanosensors is an area of critical interest to nanotoxicology, detection and risk assessment, as well as for monitoring of environmental and/or biological exposure. This article discusses emerging fields of nanotoxicology and nanomonitoring including the challenges of characterizing engineered nanomaterials and the potentials of combining existing analytical techniques with conventional cytotoxicity methods. Two case studies are provided for development of Category II nanosensors for fullerene nanoparticles and quantum dots. One highlights the uniqueness of a portable, dissolved oxygen electrochemical sensor arrays capable of detecting the ENMs as well as provide rapid nanotoxicological information. This review has shown that addressing the complex and critical issues surrounding the environmental transformation and toxicity of ENMs must be accompanied by the creation of new approaches or further developments of existing instrumentation. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={A study of the factors involved in obtaining valid global metabolite profiles from the HPLC-MS of rat or mouse plasma for the purposes of metabonomic analysis has been undertaken. Plasma proteins were precipitated with three volumes of either methanol or acetonitrile. Chromatographic separations were performed on a C18-bonded stationary phase using 3.5 and 5 μm particles packed into 2.1 and 4.6 mm i.d. formats, respectively, and on a C8 phase using 3.5 μm particles and a 2.1 mm i.d. column. Three reversed-phase gradient solvent systems, based on acidified water-acetonitrile, acidified water-methanol and acidified water-methanol-acetonitrile mixtures, were investigated. The column eluent was analysed with both positive and negative electrospray ionisation using a quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer. These studies revealed that while accurate classification of sample type can be made, there are a number of methodological problems associated with the analysis of plasma with respect to factors such as repeatability and column longevity. In particular, special care has to be taken to ensure that the analytical system is properly "conditioned" by the repeated injection of matrix samples. The use of biological quality control (QC) samples provided an important means of monitoring method performance. Finally, the source of the plasma (Zucker wild-type or (fa/fa) rat or mouse tumour model) also appeared to have an effect on the repeatability of the methodology.},

abstract={Diabetes mellitus is not a single disorder but rather a heterogeneous group of diseases that differ in respect to pathogenesis, the clinical picture and the response to dietary and pharmacological treatments. Thus, the differential diagnosis of various types and forms of diabetes is of great practical importance. This is particularly true for monogenic disease forms where some spectacular applications of pharmacogenetics have recently been described. Unfortunately, most patients with monogenic diabetes such as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) or neonatal diabetes have not undergone diagnostic molecular testing, so they can not benefit from the progress seen in this field. The reasons for this include the complexity and cost of molecular diagnostics. One of ways to change this situation is to find an efficient and cheap test to screen thousands of patients for specific forms of monogenic diabetes. These tests can be based on biomarkers discovered by one of two general strategies: a candidate approach or a systematic search based on metabonomics or proteonomics. This review summarizes recent advances in the search for putative biomarkers and the perspectives of the future progress. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Diazepam is frequently used as an adjuvant during antidepressant therapy. Recently, some studies have suggested that the treatment with benzodiazepines could have different efficacy in depressed patients as opposed to non-depressed ones. To clarify the matter, a study is currently underway, regarding the drug metabolism in rats. In order to obtain a more complete and significant set of data, the main diazepam metabolites have also been considered, namely: nordiazepam, temazepam and oxazepam. A feasible and reliable HPLC method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of these compounds in plasma and brain tissue of rats. The method has been applied to "normal" rats and to genetic rat models of depression in order to estimate drug metabolism in different breeds. Analyte separation was achieved on a C8 reversed phase column using an acidic phosphate buffer/acetonitrile mixture as the mobile phase. The detection wavelength was 238 nm. An original sample pre-treatment, based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) was developed in order to eliminate endogenous interference, using only 250 μL of matrix (brain homogenate or plasma) for a complete analysis. The method has been validated with good results in terms of precision, extraction yield, sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy on both matrices and has been successfully applied to samples from some rats subjected to the preliminary study. The obtained data will hopefully contribute to the clarification of possible differences between depressed and non-depressed subjects with respect to benzodiazepine biotransformation. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Perfluorinated acids (PFAs) are an emerging class of environmental contaminants present in various environmental and biological matrices. Two major PFA subclasses are the perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) and carboxylic acids (PFCAs). The physicochemical properties and partitioning behavior for the linear PFA members are poorly understood and widely debated. Even less is known about the numerous branched congeners with varying perfluoroalkyl chain lengths, leading to confounding issues around attempts to constrain the properties of PFAs. Current computational methods are not adequate for reliable multimedia modeling efforts and risk assessments. These compounds are widely present in surface, ground, marine, and drinking waters at concentrations that vary from pg L- 1 to g L- 1. Concentration gradients of up to several orders of magnitude are observed in all types of aquatic systems and reflect proximity to known industrial sources concentrated near populated regions. Some wastewaters contain PFAs at mg L- 1 to low g L- 1 levels, or up to 10 orders of magnitude higher than present in more pristine receiving waters. With the exception of trifluoroacetic acid, which is thought to have both significant natural and anthropogenic sources, all PFSAs and PFCAs are believed to arise from human activities. Filtration and sorption technologies offer the most promising existing removal methods for PFAs in aqueous waste streams, although sonochemical approaches hold promise. Additional studies need to be conducted to better define opportunities from evaporative, extractive, thermal, advanced oxidative, direct and catalyzed photochemical, reductive, and biodegradation methods. Most PFA treatment methods exhibit slow kinetic profiles, hindering their direct application in conventional low hydraulic residence time systems.},

abstract={PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To overview the effects of endocrine disrupters on thyroid function. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies in recent years have revealed thyroid-disrupting properties of many environmentally abundant chemicals. Of special concern is the exposure of pregnant women and infants, as thyroid disruption of the developing fetus may have deleterious effects on neurological outcome. Evidence is reviewed for the following groups of chemicals: polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, flame retardants, pesticides, perfluorinated chemicals, phthalates, bisphenol A and ultraviolet filters. Chemicals may exert thyroid effects through a variety of mechanisms of action, and some publications have focused on elucidating the mechanisms of specific (groups of) chemicals. SUMMARY: A large variety of ubiquitous chemicals have been shown to have thyroid-disrupting properties, and the combination of mechanistic, epidemiological and exposure studies indicates that the ubiquitous human and environmental exposure to industrial chemicals may impose a serious threat to human and wildlife thyroid homeostasis. Currently, available evidence suggests that authorities need to regulate exposure to thyroid-disrupting chemicals of pregnant women, neonates and small children in order to avoid potential impairment of brain development. Future studies will indicate whether adults also are at risk of thyroid damage due to these chemicals. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract={Marijuana is one of the most commonly abused illicit substances in the USA, making cannabinoids important to detect in clinical and forensic toxicology laboratories. Historically, cannabinoids in biological fluids have been derivatized and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/ MS). There has been a gradual shift in many laboratories towards liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) for this analysis due to its improved sensitivity and reduced sample preparation compared with GC/MS procedures. This paper reports a validated method for the analysis of Δ9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its two main metabolites, 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) and 11-hydroxy- Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-OH), in whole blood samples. The method has also been validated for cannabinol (CBD) and cannabidiol (CDN), two cannabinoids that were shown not to interfere with the method. This method has been successfully applied to samples both from living people and from deceased individuals obtained during autopsy. This method utilizes online solid-phase extraction (SPE) with LC/MS. Pretreatment of samples involves protein precipitation, sample concentration, ultracentrifugation, and reconstitution. The online SPE procedure was developed using Hysphere C8-EC sorbent. A chromatographic gradient with an Xterra MS C18 column was used for the separation. Four multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions were monitored for each analyte and internal standard. Linearity generally fell between 2 and 200ng/mL. The limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 0.5 to 3ng/mL and the limits of quantitation (LOQs) ranged from 2 to 8 ng/mL. The bias and imprecision were determined using a simple analysis of variance (ANOVA: single factor). The results demonstrate bias as &lt;7%, and imprecision as &lt;9%, for all components at each quantity control level. Published in 2009 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

Furthermore, low concentrations of silicon, magnesium and copper in aluminum have been measured and could be backed up by EDX and XPS analysis. Results were confirmed with a conventional LIBS system using a high-energy, low-repetition rate Nd:YAG SHG laser operating at 10 Hz with a pulse energy of 200 mJ.

abstract={The genes (ABCC8 and KCNJ11) have a key role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and thus have always been considered as excellent susceptibility candidates for involvement in type 2 diabetes. Common polymorphisms (KCNJ11 E23K and ABCC8 exon16-3t/c) in these genes have been reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes in various European-descent populations. However, there were inconsistent results in previous studies in East Asian populations and no large case-control studies have been carried out in the Chinese Han population. In this study, these two variants were genotyped in about 4000 Chinese by using TaqMan technology on an ABI7900 system. A meta-analysis was also used to assess the results of association between the two variants and type 2 diabetes in East Asian populations. Our investigation confirmed the association between the KCNJ11 E23K variant and type 2 diabetes under a recessive model (KK vs EKEE) in the Chinese Han population (odds ratio (OR)1.25, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.04-1.50, P0.017). The meta-analysis of East Asian populations also showed a strong significant association of the K allele with diabetes (OR1.15, P3 × 10 9), whereas the exon16-3t/c variant (rs1799854) in ABCC8 showed no significant association. Thus, the common E23K variant is considered as a strong candidate for type 2 diabetes susceptibility across different ethnicities. © 2009 The Japan Society of Human Genetics.},

abstract={Background and Purpose-Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is significantly associated with cryptogenic stroke (CS). However, even in patients with CS, a PFO can be an incidental finding. We sought to estimate the probability that a PFO in a patient with CS is incidental. Methods-A systematic search identified 23 case-control studies examining the prevalence of PFO in patients with CS versus control subjects with stroke of known cause. Using simple assumptions and Bayes' theorem, we calculated the probability a PFO is incidental in patients with CS. Random effects meta-analyses estimated the odds ratio (OR) of a PFO in CS versus control subjects in different age populations, with or without atrial septal aneurysms, and were used to summarize across studies the probability that a PFO in CS is incidental. Results-The summary OR (95% CIs) for PFO in CS versus control subjects was 2.9 (CI, 2.1 to 4.0). The corresponding ORs for young and old patients (< or >55 years) were 5.1 (3.3 to 7.8) and 2.0 (>1.0 to 3.7), respectively. The corresponding probabilities that a PFO in patients with CS is incidental were 33% (28% to 39%) in age-inclusive studies, 20% (16% to 25%) in younger patients, and 48% (34% to 66%) in older patients. These probabilities were much lower when an atrial septal aneurysm was present. Conclusions-In patients with otherwise CS, approximately one third of discovered PFOs are likely to be incidental and hence not benefit from closure. This probability is sensitive to patient characteristics such as age and the presence of an atrial septal aneurysm, suggesting the importance of patient selection in therapeutic decision-making. © 2009 American Heart Association Inc.},

A great breakthrough has been made in the detailed mechanistic kinetics of the chemic synthesis, but LM (Levenberg- Marquardt) algorithm still plays a leading role in estimating parameters of the kinetic model. As an unlimited algorithm, LM algorithm often makes an erroreous conclusion because of parameters exceeding limit. Its computation deeply depends on the initial point, and easily falls into non-global optima. It is a new attempt to apply GA(Genetic Algorithm) to the solutions of optimization problems of FTS(Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis) parameters.

abstract={Humans and ecological species have been found to have detectable body burdens of a number of perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAA) including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). In mouse and rat liver these compounds elicit transcriptional and phenotypic effects similar to peroxisome proliferator chemicals (PPC) that work through the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Recent studies indicate that along with PPARα other nuclear receptors are required for transcriptional changes in the mouse liver after PFOA exposure including the constitutive activated receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) that regulate xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XME). To determine the potential role of CAR/PXR in mediating effects of PFAAs in rat liver, we performed a meta-analysis of transcript profiles from published studies in which rats were exposed to PFOA or PFOS. We compared the profiles to those produced by exposure to prototypical activators of CAR, (phenobarbital (PB)), PXR (pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN)), or PPARα (WY-14,643 (WY)). As expected, PFOA and PFOS elicited transcript profile signatures that included many known PPARα target genes. Numerous XME genes were also altered by PFOA and PFOS but not WY. These genes exhibited expression changes shared with PB or PCN. Reexamination of the transcript profiles from the livers of chicken or fish exposed to PFAAs indicated that PPARα, CAR, and PXR orthologs were not activated. Our results indicate that PFAAs under these experimental conditions activate PPARα, CAR, and PXR in rats but not chicken and fish. Lastly, we discuss evidence that human populations with greater CAR expression have lower body burdens of PFAAs.},

abstract={Background, aim, and scope: The development of robust and up-to-date generic life cycle inventory data for materials is absolutely crucial for the LCA community since many LCA studies rely on these generic data about materials. LCA databases and software usually include within their package such generic LCI datasets. However, in many cases, the quality of these data is poor while the methodology and the models used for their development are rarely accessible or transparent. This paper presents the development of robust European LCI datasets for the production of primary and recycled aluminium ingots and for the transformation of aluminium ingot into semi-finished products, i.e. sheet, foil and extrusion. Materials and methods: The environmental data have been collected through an extensive environmental survey, organised among the European aluminium industry, focusing on the year 2005 and covering EU27 countries as well as EFTA countries (Norway, Iceland and Switzerland). From this survey, European averages, i.e. foreground data, have been calculated for the direct inputs and outputs of the various aluminium processes. Using the GaBi software, the foreground data have been combined within LCI models integrating background LCI data on energy supply systems, ancillary processes and materials. For the primary aluminium production (smelters), a specific model for the electricity production has been developed. The methodology for the data consolidation and for the development of the various models is explained as well as the main differences between the new modelling approach and LCI models used in the past. An independent expert has critically reviewed the entire LCI project including data collection, models development, calculation of LCI data and associated environmental indicators. Results: As confirmed by the critical review, the new LCI datasets for aluminium ingot production and transformation into semi-finished products have been developed though a robust methodology in full accordance with ISO 14040 and 14044. Most significant environmental data and LCI results are reported in this paper with an emphasis on energy use and the major emissions to air. The full environmental report, including the critical review report and the calculation of environmental indicators for a pre-set of impact categories, is available on the website of the European Aluminium Association (EAA 2008). Whenever possible, the updated European averages and the new LCI data are compared with previous results developed from two past European surveys covering respectively the years 2002 and 1998. For the aluminium processes related to primary production, European averages are also benchmarked against global averages calculated from two worldwide surveys covering the years 2000 and 2005. Discussion: While some data evolutions are directly attributed to the variation of foreground data, e.g. raw materials consumption or energy use within the aluminium processes, modifications related to the system boundaries, the background data and the modelling hypotheses can also influence significantly the LCI results. For primary aluminium production, the evolution of the foreground data is dominated by the strong decrease of PFC (perfluorocarbon) emissions (about 70% since 1998). In addition, the electricity structure calculated from the refined electricity model shows significant differences compared to previous models. In the 2005 electricity model, the hydropower share reaches 58% while coal contributes to 15% only of the electricity production. In 1998, the respective share of coal-based and hydro-electricity were respectively calculated to 25% and 52%. As a result, the electricity background LCI data are then significantly affected and influence also positively the environmental profile of primary aluminium in Europe. For the semi-production processes, the reduction of process scrap production, especially for extrusion and foil, demonstrates the increase of process efficiency from 1998. In parallel, a significant reduction of energy use is observed between 1998 and 2005. However, this positive trend is not fully reflected within LCI data due to the significant contribution of the background electricity data. The choice of the electricity model plays also a critical role for these transformation processes since electricity production contributes to about 2/3 of the consumption of the non-renewable energy and to about the same level of the air emissions. In such a case, the move from the UCPTE electricity model used in the past towards the EU25 electricity model used for the development of the updated LCI data has a detrimental effect on the environmental profile of the three LCI datasets respectively related to sheet, foil and extrusion. In addition to energy and process scrap reduction, the reduction of the VOC (volatile organic compounds) emission is also a major trend in foil production. Finally, for old aluminium scrap recycling, the new LCI data show a dramatic improvement regarding energy efficiency, reinforcing the environmental soundness of promoting and supporting aluminium recycling within the aluminium product life cycles. Conclusions: This paper shows the development of generic LCI data about aluminium production and transformation processes which are based on robust data, methodologies and models in full accordance with ISO 14040 and 14044 standards, as confirmed by the critical review. The publishing of these LCI datasets definitely shows the commitment of the European aluminium industry to contribute in a transparent, fair and scientifically sound manner to product sustainability in a life cycle thinking perspective. Recommendations and perspectives: Software houses and LCA practitioners are invited to update their generic European data on aluminium with the herewith datasets. Even if the quality and the completeness of these LCI data reach a high standard, some areas for data improvements have been identified, as described within the review report. Land use, water use and solid waste treatment appear as three priority areas for data refining and improvement. The land use dimension, particularly meaningful for bauxite mining, is not covered in the current LCI data while it is now integrated within many LCA studies. Up to now, the reporting of meaningful and robust data on water origins and use have not been possible due to the huge discrepancies between the surveyed sites combined with the difficulty to report coherent input and output water mass flows. The development of water data, only focussing on water-stressed areas, will most probably make more sense in the future. Finally, collecting more qualitative information about solid waste processing and treatment will help to include such operations within the system boundaries and to model their associated air, water and soil emissions. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

The ITO different from it by a conventional DC or RF magnetron sputtering was optimized in crystallinity, grain morphology, surface roughness and oxygen content by plasma treatment, and the effect on the OLED I-V characteristic was identified. Crystallinity of ITO was improved with a short plasma treatment time less than 15 min. The grains were an equi-axed as deposited state and changed to columnar grains when the plasma treatment time was exceeded above 20 min. The surface roughness was maintained within the targeted 1.8-2.0 nm range with plasma treatment from 5 to 20 min. Oxygen content measured using XPS analysis was increased with 15 min plasma treatment during the ITO grains maintained an equi-axed, but it was decreased again with 25 min plasma treatment. The I-V characteristic of OLED was relatively good with 15 min plasma treatment. It was considered because the ITO anode can contain higher oxygen in equi-axed grains, and can have better crystallinity and relevant surface roughness by 15 min plasma treatment. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

Since 2001 over 3000 papers on Ginkgo biloba have appeared, and about 400 of them pertain to chemical analysis in a broad sense and are cited herein. The more important ones are discussed and, where relevant, compared with the best methods published prior to 2002. In the same period over 2500 patents were filed on Ginkgo and the very few related to analysis are mentioned as well. Important constituents include terpene trilactones, i.e. ginkgolide A, B, C, J and bilobalide, flavonol glycosides, biflavones, proanthocyanidins, alkylphenols, simple phenolic acids, 6-hydroxykynurenic acid, 4-O-methylpyridoxine and polyprenols. In the most common so-called "standardised" Ginkgo extracts and phytopharmaceuticals several of these classes are no longer present. About 130 new papers deal with the analysis of the terpene trilactones. They are mostly extracted with methanol or water or mixtures thereof. Supercritical fluid extraction and pressurised water extraction are also possible. Sample clean-up is mostly by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate although no sample clean-up at all in combination with LC/MS/MS is gaining in importance. Separation and detection can be routinely carried out by RP-HPLC with ELSD, RI or MS, or by GC/FID or GC/MS after silylation. Hydrolysis followed by LC/MS allows the simultaneous analysis of terpene trilactones and flavonol aglycones. No quantitative procedure for all major flavonol glycosides has yet been published because they are not commercially available. The quantitation of a few available glycosides has been carried out but does not serve a real purpose. After acidic hydrolysis to the aglycones quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin and separation by HPLC, quantitation is straightforward and yields by recalculation an estimation of the original total flavonol glycoside content. A profile of the genuine flavonol glycosides can detect poor storage or adulteration. Although the toxicity of Ginkgo alkylphenols upon oral administration has never been undoubtedly proven, most suppliers limit their content in extracts to 5 ppm and dozens of papers on their analysis were published. One procedure in which a methanolic extract is directly injected on a C8 HPLC column appears superior in terms of sensitivity (<5 ppm), separation, simplicity and validation and will be incorporated in the European Pharmacopoeia. Alternatively GC/MS and ELISA methods can be used. A sharp contrast to the plethora of papers on terpene trilactones, flavonol glycosides, and ginkgolic acids forms the low number of papers on biflavones, proanthocyanidins, simple phenolics, simple acids, and other constituents that make up the remaining 70% of Ginkgo standardised extracts. More research in this direction is clearly needed. For the analysis of Ginkgo proanthocyanidins (7%) for instance, no reliable assays are yet existing. Finally the growing literature on pharmacokinetic and fingerprinting studies of Ginkgo is briefly summarised. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: In the past, different research groups could show that treatment of immune cells with inhibitors of post-proline splitting dipeptidyl aminopeptidases leads to functional changes in the immune system consistent with immunosuppression. This is due to the inhibition of proliferation of lymphocytes and the production of inflammatory cytokines of the TH1, TH2, and TH17 cells as well as the induction of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and interleukin (IL)-1RA. Until recently, most of the effects of these inhibitors on immune functions were attributed to the inhibition of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPIV/CD26). With the identification of new peptidases of the DPIV family (DASH) with the same or similar substrate specificity [fibroblast activation protein (FAP), DP8/9], the question arose whether and to what extent the inhibition of intracellularly localized enzymes, DP8 and DP9, contribute to the observed immunosuppression. In addition, members of the aminopeptidase N (APN) family are also involved in the regulation of immune functions. Hence, the concept of a combined targeting of both families of peptidases for treatment of inflammatory diseases is a promising strategy. Results/Conclusions: Summarizing data obtained from the usage of different non-selective and selective inhibitors of DPIV, DP8/9, FAP, and DPII, this review provides evidence that in addition to DPIV, DP8/9 also regulate the immune response via modulation of cell cycle progression and cytokine production. The strongest and most consistent effects in vitro were, however, observed with non-selective inhibitors for the suppression of DNA synthesis and cytokine production. Similar effects were provoked by APN inhibitors, which were also found to suppress DNA synthesis and the production of inflammatory cytokines in vitro. However, different mechanisms and signaling pathways appear to mediate the cellular effects resulting from the inhibition of either APN or DPIV family members. In particular, members of the APN family uniquely influence the function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cells. Consequently, the concomitant inhibition of both APN and DPIV enzyme families by means of two separate inhibitors or by binary inhibitors with specificity for both enzyme families (PETIR™, peptidase targeted immunoregulation) synergistically affects immune cells on the level of cell cycle regulation, suppression of TH1, TH2, and TH17 cytokines as well as the activation of regulatory T-cells. Besides leukocytes, dermal cells as sebocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts are also targeted by these inhibitors. This strongly suggests a broad potential of the multiple anti-inflammatory effects of PETIR™ in treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, allergies, and transplant rejections, as well as of inflammatory skin diseases, such as acne, psoriasis, rosacea or atopic dermatitis. The first active dual inhibitor, IP10.C8, has been developed by IMTM for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases and has just entered the first phase II study. © 2009 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin New York.},

abstract={Two novel genes (pwtsB and pwtsC) encoding lipases were isolated by screening the soil metagenomic library. Sequence analysis revealed that pwtsB encodes a protein of 301 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 33 kDa, and pwtsC encodes a protein of 323 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 35 kDa. Furthermore, both genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using pET expression system. The expressed recombinant enzymes were purified by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and characterized by spectrophotometric with different p-nitrophenyl esters. The results showed that PWTSB displayed a high degree of activity and stability at 20°C with an optimal pH of around 8.0, and PWTSC at 40°C with an optimal pH of around 7.0. P-nitrophenyl palmitate (p-NPP) was identified as the best substrate of PWTSB and PWTSC. The specific activities of PWTSB and PWTSC were 150 and 166 U/mg, respectively toward p-NPP at 30°C, about 20-fold higher than that toward p-nitrophenyl butyrate (C4) and caprylate (C8). In conclusion, our results suggest that PWTSB is a cold adapt lipase and PWTSC is a thermostable lipase to long-chain p-nitrophenyl esters. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={This review focuses on the importance of air presence at hydrophobic solid surfaces for wetting film rupture and kinetics of three phase contact formation. Affinity to air is a typical feature of hydrophobic surfaces, but it has been often either overlooked or not taken into consideration. When the hydrophobic surface, contacted earlier with air, is immersed into water then air can stay attached to the surface. The origin of long range hydrophobic forces and data showing that these interactions were due to the bridging of nanobubbles attached to the hydrophobic surfaces are discussed. A major part of the review is devoted to the description and analysis of data showing that air (nano-, micro-bubbles and/or air film) present at a hydrophobic surface facilitated rupture of the liquid film and three phase contact formation during bubble collisions with flat Teflon plates of different surface roughness. Although all Teflon plates were highly hydrophobic (contact angles ca. 100°-130°) the time of the three phase contact (TPC) formation and attachment of the colliding bubble was strongly affected by the plate surface roughness. The time of the TPC formation was shortened from over 80 down to 2-3 ms when the roughness was increased from below 1 μm to over 50 μm. Higher surface roughness means that larger amounts of air was entrapped during the Teflon plates' immersion in water. Additional experimental evidence is given, showing that facilitation of the TPC formation and the bubble attachment was due to air presence and re-distribution over the Teflon surfaces: i) prolonging the plate immersion time resulted in quicker attachment; ii) irregular and disappearing air pockets were recorded at a Teflon surface; iii) a satellite bubble left at a Teflon surface during the first collision facilitated the attachment; iv) attachment always occurred during the first collision in the case of a very rough "Teflon V" surface, but in highly concentrated n-octanol and n-heptanol solutions there was bouncing and attachment occurred during the second collision, moreover; v) the degree of bubble kinetic energy transferred into surface energy was significantly smaller during collisions with hydrophobic (Teflon) surfaces than with the hydrophilic ones. The mechanism of air entrapment and redistribution over Teflon plates immersed in water is presented. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The significant interspecies and season-specific differences in PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs concentrations were observed. The contribution of dl-PCBs to the total toxicity equivalents (TEQs) ranged between 50% and 70%, dependently on fish species. In all samples, concentrations of PCDF were higher in comparison with that of PCDD. The permissible limits of the content of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs (8 pg g-1 fresh weight for the sum of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs, and 4 pg g-1 fresh weight for the PCDD/Fs) were exceeded mainly in salmon samples (in 80% of salmon samples studied). The elevated levels of PCDD/F and dl-PCB were observed only in two of seventy two herring samples, and in ten of 62 sprat samples. The multiple regression analysis revealed that fish lipid content, and concentration of PCB 153, used simultaneously, might be useful in the prediction of TEQ values of fish samples. These two variables explained more than 80% of total variance. For all fish species studied, the correlation coefficients obtained with the multiple regression analysis were higher than that obtained with the regression analysis involving total TEQ values, and only one independent variable: fish lipid content. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Two different types of CNTs with low surface area (∼25 m2/g) and high surface area (∼170 m2/g) were prepared and treated with 35 wt% HNO3 at 25 °C and 110 °C for 16 h. Fe/CNTs were prepared using incipient wetness impregnation method with iron loading of 10 wt%. The CNT supports and catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption, ICP, TPR, XRD, SEM, TEM and Raman spectroscopy. The acid treatments at 25 °C and 110 °C increased the BET surface area by 18% and 31%. The results of Raman analysis revealed that the acid treatment increased the number of defects which are considered as anchoring site for metal particles. TEM analysis showed that the major parts of the iron particles were homogenously distributed inside the acid treated nanotubes. According to the XRD analysis, the acid treatment on both families of CNTs resulted in decrease in metal particle sizes. The FT synthesis was carried out in a fixed-bed microreactor (275 °C, 2 MPa, CO/H2 = 2) for 120 h. Among the catalysts studied, Fe catalyst supported on pre-treated CNTs at 110 °C was stable and active while, the other catalysts experienced rapid deactivations. The Fe catalyst supported on CNTs low surface area and larger diameter showed much lower CH4 and higher C5+ selectivities. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Monocyte/macrophage adhesion to biomaterials, correlated with foreign body response, occurs through protein-mediated surface interactions. Albumin-selective perfluorocarbon (FC) biomaterials are generally poorly cell-conducive because of insufficient receptor-mediated surface interactions, but macrophages bind to albumin-coated substrates and also preferentially to highly hydrophobic fluorinated surfaces. Bone marrow macrophages (BMMO) and IC-21, RAW 264.7, and J774A.1 monocyte/macrophage cells were cultured on FC surfaces. Protein deposition onto two distinct FC surfaces from complex and single-component solutions was tracked using fluorescence and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) methods. Cell adhesion and growth on protein pretreated substrates were compared by light microscopy. Flow cytometry and integrin-directed antibody receptor blocking were used to assess integrins critical for monocyte/macrophage adhesion in vitro. Albumin predominantly adsorbs onto both FC surfaces from 10% serum. In cultures preadsorbed with albumin or serum-dilutions, BMMO responded similar to IC-21 at early time points. Compared with Teflon® AF, plasma-polymerized FC was less permissive to extended cell proliferation. The β2 integrins play major roles in macrophage adhesion to FC surfaces: antibody blocking significantly disrupted cell adhesion. Albumin-mediated cell adhesion mechanisms to FC surfaces could not be clarified. Primary BMMO and secondary IC-21 macrophages behave similarly on FC surfaces, regardless of preadsorbed protein biasing, with respect to adhesion, cell morphology, motility, and proliferation. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Bacterial adhesion and colonization are complicated processes that depend on many factors, including surface chemistry, hydrophobicity, and surface roughness. The contribution of each of these factors has not been fully elucidated because most previous studies used different polymeric surfaces to achieve differences in properties. The objective of this study was to modify hydrophobicity and roughness on one polymeric surface, eliminating the confounding contribution of surface chemistry. Mechanically assembled monolayer (MAM) preparation methods (both one- and two-dimensional) were used to impart different degrees of hydrophobicity on fluoroalkylsilane (FAS)-coated silicone. Surface roughness was varied by casting the silicone to templates prepared with different abrasives. Surface hydrophobicity was determined by contact angle measurement, whereas surface roughness was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Bacterial adhesion and colonization were analyzed using a direct colony-counting method and SEM images. Hydrophobicity increased as a function of stretched length or width (Δx or Δy); it reached a maximum at Δx = 60% with one-dimensional MAM and decreased as Δx further increased to 80 and 100%. The same trend was observed for the two-dimensional MAM. After 12-h incubation, all the FAS/silicone surfaces had significantly reduced adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis by 42-89%, compared to untreated silicone, and the degree of which is inversely related to surface hydrophobicity. On the other hand, surface roughness had a significant effect on bacterial adhesion and colonization only when the root-mean-square roughness was higher than 200 nm. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Brachial plexus block is used in surgical procedures of the upper limbs. The brachial plexus is a potential territory for absorption of local anesthetics. Studies on bupivacaine isomers have shown reduced cardiovascular toxicity of its levorotatory form (levobupivacaine). However, the anesthetic efficacy (sensorial and motor blockades) of levobupivacaine in neuroaxis blocks has been debated. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the anesthetic efficacy of levobupivacaine in brachial plexus block, using the perivascular subclavian approach, by comparing it to racemic bupivacaine. METHODS: Fifty adult patients of both genders, ASA I and II, underwent subclavian perivascular brachial plexus block, with the aid of a peripheral neurostimulator, for orthopedic surgeries of the upper limbs. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: GBUPI - racemic bupivacaine, and GLEVO - levobupivacaine, and they received 30 mL of the 0.5% solution. Sensorial blockade was evaluated by pinprick stimulation from C 5 to C8 metameres; and the motor blockade was assessed 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes after the administration of the local anesthetic or until blockade of fingers, hand, forearm, and arm movements was observed. RESULTS: Statistical differences in latency, failure rate, and degree of the motor blockade, and failure of the sensorial blockade between both groups were not observed, but the latency of the sensorial blockade in all metameres analyzed showed statistically significant differences. Adverse events inherent to the administration of local anesthetics were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: The anesthetic efficacy of levobupivacaine in brachial plexus block was similar to that of the racemic solution commonly used.},

Perfluorinated β-diketone, 1,1,1,5,5,6,6,6-octafluoro-2,4-hexanedione (C6F8βDK) dissolves in the fluorous solvent FC-72 and can extract transition metal ions from water into FC-72. The extraction efficiency in the FC-72 system is comparable to that of chloroform. By using the immiscibility of FC-72 with conventional organic solvents, metal extraction was also achieved from acetonitrile and dioxane. Metal ions extracted into FC-72 can be readily stripped using 1 M nitric acid. We succeeded in a colorimetric assay of metal ion concentration in water and in organic solvents by contacting each solvent with FC-72 containing C6F8βDK. Iron ions with different concentrations (0 - 0.1 mM) in water or acetonitrile are completely extracted into FC-72 to form a Fe3+-C6F8βDK complex, which can be detected by spectrophotometry due to its absorption in the UV-vis region. We have demonstrated that fluorous solvents would be promising candidates for a novel separation and analytical medium for metal ions. © 2008 The Japan Society for Analytical Science},

abstract={This review will present clear evidence that the presence of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and hormones in municipal wastewaters is a valid topic of concern, and that great efforts should continue to be made to investigate this realm of scientific thought. Many compounds are excreted by humans and animals, entering the environment after some form of treatment usually through a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Recent monitoring studies have found low-levels of contaminants throughout municipal wastewater treatment processes, beginning with influent wastewater, straight though to receiving waters in the proximity of effluent discharge points. Moreover, the effects and potential risks associated with the persistence of such compounds have been identified in the aquatic environment and beyond. What to do with this information is a complex concern and whether or not alarm bells should be sounding, awakening a silent emergency, is on the forefront of the issue. The evidence presented here will attempt to inspire the position that it would be unscientific, careless and irresponsible to rest on the assumption that the low levels of chemical containments currently present in the environment require little or no action from the community. Can we look to environmental impact studies for some answers? Will documenting the detrimental effects of certain compounds on various aquatic organisms help to defend or vilify this reasoning? The difficulty of this issue is that no clear answers can be made in the face of such simple and clear questions. The truth of the matter is that at this point in time, although the literature is growing and insights are being made, there is purely not enough valuable data available. This review will document the growing literature with respect to the detection and abundance of anthropogenic compounds that enter the environment and the potential risks associated with their eventual presence in drinking water and food products. It will also become evident that extrapolating the effects of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP's) on exposed laboratory animals to humans appears to be inappropriate. It is clear that despite the perceived low priority of many of these compounds, further investigations should be performed in order to better understand the neurological and reproductive modes of actions associated with several of them. Whatever roles the various emerging pollutants in the environment play needs to be firmly established. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Changing environmental interests in the wire and cable industry (WCI) have generated studies into the eco-performance of various data and communication cabling system alternatives for computers and local area networks (LAN). To accurately assess the various alternatives, the installed electronic functionality and fire safety performance requirements of the various end-use product options must be equivalent. In buildings, high fire performance (HFP) based polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheathed and perfluoropolymer (PFP) insulated (CMP or PVC/PFP) cables can be routed directly in concealed plenum spaces without the use of additional metal conduit fire protection. Products that do not meet specific high fire-performance criteria, such as low-smoke zero-halogen (LSZH/PE) cables or riser-rated cables (CMR or PVC/PE), often must be protected inside other structures, typically metal EMT conduit or trunking. Life cycle analysis (LCA) via ISO 14040 methodology is used to evaluate cabling alternatives using an appropriate functional unit. Copper wire is identified as a significant contributor to all impact categories, and the major contributor for human toxicity. The burdens for steel conduits dominate all other impact categories studied for systems requiring steel for fire performance code compliance. The additional fire safety and installation advantages provided by the CMP cables offset the environmental burdens associated with the initial manufacture of just the cable. Thus, CMP cables provide superior overall fire safety, environmental performance, and economic benefits versus LSZH/PE and CMR cables installed in metal conduits for U.S. plenum cable installations. During the writing of this paper, new fire safety research became available indicating that EMT die cast conduit-couplings can begin to weaken, melt and fail to fire-protect in less than 4 minutes at or less than 400°C (images to be shown). This finding is not consistent with previous beliefs that the fire performance of CMR or LSZH cable in EMT conduit was equal to the performance of CMP cable. © 2008 ASCE.},

abstract={There are conflicting reports about the effectiveness of perfluorocarbons used in the two-layer method (TLM) of pancreas preservation for human islet transplantation. The mechanism of action is unclear and the optimal role of this method uncertain. The study design was a meta-analysis of the evidence that TLM improves islet isolation outcomes. Pubmed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, and BIOSIS were searched electronically in January 2008. After selecting the relevant human trials for meta-analysis data relating to donor variables, study design, primary and secondary islet isolation outcomes were extracted. Electronic searches identified eight unique citations, describing 11 human studies that were eligible for the meta-analysis. When comparing TLM with preservation in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution, there was a statistically significant higher islet yield [WMD 711.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 140.03-1283.07] in the TLM group. The proportion of transplantable preparations obtained was not significantly different (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.89-1.88) between the two groups. The rate of successful islet isolations for marginal organs was higher in the TLM group (OR 6.69, 95% CI 1.80-24.87). Improved oxygenation and preservation of cellular bioengertics is thought to be the main underlying mechanism, although no single mechanism has yet been confirmed. There is currently no clear evidence that the TLM is beneficial in human islet transplantation. It may improve the preservation of marginal organs. Copyright © 2008 Cognizant Comm. Corp.},

abstract={Meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a structural analogue of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) and is taken up by cells rich in sympathetic neurons by an active uptake process mediated by the NE transporter, which is referred to as uptake-1. It is a valuable agent in the diagnosis of myocardial abnormalities as well as that of several neuroendocrine tumors such as neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma and carcinoid tumors. MIBG labeled with 131I also is used extensively in the therapy of several neuroendocrine tumors. Over the years, a substantial amount of work has been undertaken to improve its clinical utility. Currently, radio-iodinated MIBG used in the clinic is prepared by an exchange radio-iodination method and, thus, is of low specific activity. For possible better targeting and to ward off pharmacological effects, its preparation at a no-carrier-added level both by solution-phase and solid-phase synthesis has been developed. For potential use in the treatment of micrometastatic diseases, synthesis of an analogue labeled with the a emitter 211At was devised. Development of analogues labeled with positron emitting radionuclides such as 124I, 18F, and 76Br has been reported. Further, efforts have been put in to improve its pharmacokinetic properties by structural modifications. Various aspects of these developments are reviewed herein.},

abstract={Current analytical methods used for screening drugs and their metabolites in biological samples from victims of drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) or other vulnerable groups can lack sufficient sensitivity. The application of liquid chromatography, employing small particle sizes, with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is likely to offer the sensitivity required for detecting candidate drugs and/or their metabolites in urine, as demonstrated here for ketamine. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was performed following extraction of urine (4 mL) using mixed-mode (cation and C8) solid-phase cartridges. Only 20 μL of the 250 μL extract was injected, leaving sufficient volume for other assays important in DFSA cases. Three ion transitions were chosen for confirmatory purposes. As ketamine and norketamine (including their stable isotopes) are available as reference standards, the assay was additionally validated for quantification purposes to study elimination of the drug and primary metabolite following a small oral dose of ketamine (50 mg) in 6 volunteers. Dehydronorketamine, a secondary metabolite, was also analyzed qualitatively to determine whether monitoring could improve retrospective detection of administration. The detection limit for ketamine and norketamine was 0.03 ng/mL and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively, and these compounds could be confirmed in urine for up to 5 and 6 days, respectively. Dehydronorketamine was confirmed up to 10 days, providing a very broad window of detection. © 2008.},

abstract={It is well known that, across all populations (based on geographic location, race, ethnicity, age, and sex), coronary artery disease (CAD) is the single most common cause of death. The commonly performed revascularization procedures for the treatment of symptomatic CAD are percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) by itself or followed by the deployment of either a bare-metal stent (BMS) or a drug-eluting stent (DES). In the latter type, a drug that is either embedded in polymeric or nonpolymeric coating(s) on the stent surface or directly attached to the stent surface elutes into the blood stream at a controlled rate over a period of time, typically 14-30 days. Over the years, there has been a steady decline in the use of PTCA and a concomitant sharp increase in the use of stents, with DESs being the predominant choice in the last 3 years. The present contribution represents a critical review of the literature on the materials, fluid dynamics, and solid mechanics aspects of both BMSs and DESs, with special reference to in-stent restenosis and in-stent thrombosis, these being risks that present commonly. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Electrochemical sensors have great potential for environmental monitoring of toxic metal ions in waters due to their portability, field-deployability and excellent detection limits. However, electrochemical sensors employing mercury-free approaches typically suffer from binding competition for metal ions and fouling by organic substances and surfactants in natural waters, making sample pretreatments such as wet ashing necessary. In this work, we have developed mercury-free sensors by coating a composite of thiol self-assembled monolayers on mesoporous supports (SH-SAMMS™) and Nafion on glassy-carbon electrodes. With the combined benefit of SH-SAMMS™ as an outstanding metal preconcentrator and Nafion as an antifouling binder, the sensors could detect 0.5 ppb of Pb and 2.5 ppb of Cd in river water, Hanford groundwater, and seawater with a minimal amount of preconcentration time (few minutes) and without any sample pretreatment. The sensor could also detect 2.5 ppb of Cd, Pb, and Cu simultaneously. The electrodes have long service times and excellent single and inter-electrode reproducibility (5% R.S.D. after 8 consecutive measurements). Unlike SAMMS™-carbon paste electrodes, the SAMMS™-Nafion electrodes were not fouled in samples containing albumin and successfully detected Cd in human urine. Other potentially confounding factors affecting metal detection at SAMMS™-Nafion electrodes were studied, including pH effect, transport resistance of metal ions, and detection interference. With the ability to reliably detect low metal concentration ranges without sample pretreatment and fouling, SAMMS™-Nafion composite sensors have the potential to become the next-generation metal analyzers for environmental and bio-monitoring of toxic metals. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={At many point feed prebake smelters, the definition of an anode effect is "all time above 8 volts" (T>8V). In this scenario, all pot operating time in excess of 8 volts is integrated and used to estimate perfluorocarbon (PFC) gas emissions using plant-specific or Tier 2 default PFC coefficients. This definition assumes that all "T >8V" is due to actual PFC generating anode effects. In Soderberg potlines, at least two additional scenarios occur that cause long-term (several hour long) pot operations above 8 volts: 1) a sustained rise to 8-10 volts due largely to atypical anode bottom profiles and (2) the "cut-in" process when a Soderberg pot is restarted (or newly started) wherein liquid bath is added and the reduction cell is energized. Continuous PFC monitoring was performed on two horizontal stud Soderberg "cut-in" pots using either a self-baked anode (from a prior shutdown) or a furnace baked anode. PFCs were generated in significant amounts only during pot operating voltage spikes at the early stages of pot "cut-in". No significant PFC emissions were observed at later stages of the "cut-in" when pot operating voltage was evolving from 10 volts to normal range (4-6 volts). This data suggests that Soderberg pot cut-ins or operating instabilities could cause overestimation of PFC emissions if included in the anode effect inventory, depending upon plantspecific anode effect duration recording practices. The data observed in this study support a Soderberg anode effect definition of "time above 9.5 volts," or that includes an analysis of the voltage slope term to verify that a true (ore starvation based) anode effect event has actually occurred.},

Bristol-Myers Squibb Medical Imaging did submit a requested literature search and performed a requested formatting of the manuscript to conform to the technical requirements of the journal. Estimated time to complete this activity: 1 hour. The failure of echocardiography to give diagnostically useful information in a significant proportion of patients has led to the development of specific contrast agents to enhance imaging. Suitable contrast media must have the ability to modify ultrasound characteristics, be capable of crossing the pulmonary capillary bed, show stability over the duration of a procedure, offer low blood solubility with low toxicity and be rapidly eliminated. The current generation of ultrasound contrast agents comprises microbubbles of a high molecular-weight gas encapsulated in a shell of phospholipid or protein. A review of the clinical evidence shows that these agents are clinically effective in enhancing echocardiographic imaging. They enable the rescue of failed procedures, often sparing patients from invasive tests, but appear not to add to the burden of side effects. Indeed, the benefits of using contrast agents in stress echocardiography have been recommended in recently published American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. Myocardial contrast echocardiography has now developed to the stage where assessment of myocardial perfusion for the detection of coronary artery disease is possible with the same diagnostic accuracy as radionuclide imaging. However, in comparison with the latter technique, it is less expensive, is more portable, and avoids the use of ionizing radiation. It is precisely the ability of myocardial contrast echocardiography to simultaneously assess function and perfusion at the bedside that has given it a unique role in clinical practice. This review provides an overview of the clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of contrast echocardiography in the assessment of myocardial structure, function, and perfusion. © 2008 American Society of Echocardiography.},

abstract={Perfluorinated acids, including perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs), and perfluorinated sulfonates (PFASs), are environmentally persistent and have been detected in a variety of wildlife across the globe. The most commonly detected PFAS, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), has been classified as a persistent and bioaccumulative substance. Similarities in chemical structure and environmental behavior of PFOS and the PFCAs that have been detected in wildlife have generated concerns about the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs. Differences between partitioning behavior of perfluorinated acids and persistent lipophilic compounds complicate the understanding of PFCA bioaccumulation and the subsequent classification of the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs according to existing regulatory criteria. Based on available research on the bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids, five key points are highlighted in this review: (1) bioconcentration and bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids are directly related to the length of each compound's fluorinated carbon chain; (2) PFASs are more bioaccumulative than PFCAs of the same fluorinated carbon chain length; (3) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (perfluorooctanoate (PFO) and shorter PFCAs) are not considered bioaccumulative according to the range of promulgated bioaccumulation, "B", regulatory criteria of 1000-5000 L/kg; (4) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less have low biomagnification potential in food webs, and (5) more research is necessary to fully characterize the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains (>7 fluorinated carbons), as PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains may exhibit partitioning behavior similar to or greater than PFOS. The bioaccumulation potential of perfluorinated acids with seven fluorinated carbons or less appears to be several orders of magnitude lower than "legacy" persistent lipophilic compounds classified as bioaccumulative. Thus, although many PFCAs are environmentally persistent and can be present at detectable concentrations in wildlife, it is clear that PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (including PFO) are not bioaccumulative according to regulatory criteria. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

To address whether a previous extraction protocol for gas chromatography (GC)/MS-based metabolic profiling of plasma could be used for UPLC/MS-based analysis, the original protocol was compared with similar methods for extraction of low-molecular-weight compounds from plasma via protein precipitation. Differences between extraction methods could be observed, but the previously published extraction method was considered the best. UPLC columns with three different stationary phases (C8, C18, and phenyl) were used in identical experimental runs consisting of a total of 60 injections of extracted male and female plasma samples. The C8 column was determined to be the best for metabolic profiling analysis on plasma. The acquired UPLC/MS data of extracted male and female plasma samples was subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Furthermore, a strategy for compound identification was applied here, demonstrating the strength of high-mass-accuracy time-of-flight (TOF)/MS analysis in metabolic profiling. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) are the most abundant group II elements in both plants and animals. Genetic variation in shoot Ca and shoot Mg concentration (shoot Ca and Mg) in plants can be exploited to biofortify food crops and thereby increase dietary Ca and Mg intake for humans and livestock. We present a comprehensive analysis of within-species genetic variation for shoot Ca and Mg, demonstrating that shoot mineral concentration differs significantly between subtaxa (varietas). We established a structured diversity foundation set of 376 accessions to capture a high proportion of species-wide allelic diversity within domesticated Brassica oleracea, including representation of wild relatives (C genome, 1n = 9) from natural populations. These accessions and 74 modern F1 hybrid cultivars were grown in glasshouse and field environments. Shoot Ca and Mg varied 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively, and was typically not inversely correlated with shoot biomass, within most subtaxa. The closely related capitata (cabbage) and sabauda (Savoy cabbage) subtaxa consistently had the highest mean shoot Ca and Mg. Shoot Ca and Mg in glasshouse-grownplants was highly correlated with data from the field. To understand and dissect the genetic basis of variation in shoot Ca and Mg, we studied homozygous lines from a segregating B. oleracea mapping population. Shoot Ca and Mg was highly heritable (up to 40%). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for shoot Ca and Mg were detected on chromosomes C2, C6, C7, C8, and, in particular, C9, where QTL accounted for 14% to 55% of the total genetic variance. The presence of QTL on C9 was substantiated by scoring recurrent backcross substitution lines, derived from the same parents. This also greatly increased the map resolution, with strong evidence that a 4-cM region on C9 influences shoot Ca. This region corresponds to a 0.41-Mb region on Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) chromosome 5 that includes 106 genes. There is also evidence that pleiotropic loci on C8 and C9 affect shoot Ca and Mg. Map-based cloning of these loci will reveal how shoot-level phenotypes relate to Ca 2+ and Mg2+ uptake and homeostasis at the molecular level. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

abstract={Changing environmental interests and new fire safety performance concerns in the wire and cable industry (WCI) have generated studies into the fire hazard and eco-performance of various data and communication cabling system altenatives for computers and local area networks (LAN). To accurately assess the various alternatives, the installed electronic functionality and fire safety performance requirements of the various end-use product options must be equivalent. For high fire performance communication cables (HFP-cables), many existing local and national regulations differentiate between end product performance options and building fire protection needs. High fire-performance, high societal-value based PVC sheathed and perfluoropolymer (PFP) insulated (PVC/PFP) cables can be routed directly in concealed plenum spaces in buildings, while products that do not meet specific high fire performance criteria, such as low-smoke zero-halogen (LSZH/PE) cables or riser-rated cables (CMR or PVC/PE), often must be protected inside other structures that do meet these building fire standards, typically using steel conduit or trunking. However, some low fire performance LAN cables, even fire-protected inside steel conduits, failed to meet the minimum flame spread and smoke criteria that HFP-cables must meet in real-scale cable fire tests at BRE/FRS and Underwriters Laboratories (when tested as a cable in steel conduit system) [10]. Life cycle analysis (LCA) via ISO 14040 methodology is used to evaluate the various cabling alternatives using an appropriate functional unit; a CAT 6 communication LAN cabling system in a typical office building, including cable, steel conduit, couplings and supports as required per building codes for the installation. Key environmental impact assessments for energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and human toxicity are all shown to favor the PVC/PFP systems once the steel conduit is included in the analysis to fire-protect the LSZH/PE or PVC/PE cables. The additional fire safety and installation advantages provided by the PVC/PFP cables more than offsets for the environmental burdens associated with the initial manufacture of just the cable, thereby providing superior overall fire safety, environmental performance, and economic benefits versus LSZH/PE and PVC/PE cables in steel conduits.},

abstract={This critical review begins with a brief, but essential, introduction to the special nature of liquid crystal materials, their peculiar properties, and their commercial applications, followed by an introductory insight into the remarkable nature of the fluoro substituent, and its fascinating influence on the properties of organic compounds. However, the main focus of the review is to discuss the enormous amount of exciting research on fluorinated liquid crystals that has been reported. The small size of the fluoro substituent enables its incorporation into all types of liquid crystal, including calamitic, discotic, banana, lyotropic, and polymers, without ruining the liquid crystalline nature of the material. However the fluoro substituent is larger than hydrogen, and hence causes a significant steric effect, which combined with the high polarity, confers many fascinating, and often remarkable, modifications to melting point, mesophase morphology and transition temperatures, and the many other very important physical properties, such as dielectric anisotropy, optical anisotropy, and visco-elastic properties. There are many different positions within a liquid crystal structure where a fluoro substituent can be located, including (i) a terminal position, (ii) within a terminal chain, as a semi-fluorinated or as a perfluorinated chain, or as one fluoro substituent at a chiral centre, (iii) as part of a linking group, and (iv) a lateral position in the core section. Such variety enables the interesting and advantageous tailoring of properties, both for the fundamental purposes of establishing structure–property relationships, and for materials targeted towards commercially-successful liquid crystal display applications. © 2007 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={As with many other bacterial species, the most commonly used method to assess staphylococcal biofilm formation in vitro is the microtiter plate assay. This assay is particularly useful for comparison of multiple strains including large-scale screens of mutant libraries. When such screens are applied to the coagulase-negative staphylococci in general, and Staphylococcus epidermidis in particular, they are relatively straightforward by comparison with microtiter plate assays used to assess biofilm formation in other bacterial species. However, in the case of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, we have found it necessary to employ specific modifications including precoating of the wells of the microtiter plate with plasma proteins and supplementation of the medium with both salt and glucose. In this chapter, we describe the microtiter plate assay in the specific context of clinical isolates of S. aureus and the use of these modifications. A second in vitro method, which also is generally dependent on coating with plasma proteins and supplementation of the growth medium, is the use of flow cells. In this method, bacteria are allowed to attach to a surface and then monitored with respect to their ability to remain attached to the substrate and differentiate into mature biofilms under the constant pressure of fluid shear force. Although flow cells are not applicable to large-scale screens, we have found that they provide a more reproducible and accurate assessment of the capacity of S. aureus clinical isolates to form a biofilm. They also provide a means of analyzing structural differences in biofilm architecture and isolating bacteria and/or spent media for analysis of physiological and metabolic changes associated with the adaptive response to growth in a biofilm. While a primary focus of this chapter is on the use of in vitro assays to assess biofilm formation in clinical isolates of 5'. aureus, it is important to emphasize two additional considerations. First, it has become increasingly evident that biofilm formation in S. epiderimidis and S. aureus is not equivalent. Additionally, to date, most studies with S. aureus have been done with a very limited number of strains, almost all of which are derived from the NCTC strain designated 8325, and we have found that these strains are not representative of the most relevant clinical isolates. As with the specific elements of our flow cell system, we have written this chapter to reflect our focus on clinical isolates of S. aureus and the specific methods that we have found most reliable in that context. Second, as is often the case, in vitro methods do not necessarily reflect events that occur in vivo. Several in vivo methods to assess biofilm, formation have been described, and these generally fall into one of two categories. The first focuses directly on staphylococcal diseases that are generally thought to include a biofilm component (e.g., endocarditis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis). A discussion of these models is also beyond the scope of this chapter, but examples are easily found in the staphylococcal literature. The second approach uses some form of implanted device in an attempt to focus more directly on implant-associated biofilms. We use a model in which a small piece of Teflon catheter is implanted subcutaneously in mice and used as a substrate for colonization. We have the advantage of using bioluminescent derivatives of S. aureus clinical isolates and the IVIS® imaging system. However, because this system, is not generally available, we restrict technical comments in this chapter to our use of an implanted catheter model evaluated by direct microbiological analysis of explanted catheters (2). © Humana Press Inc.},

The sites were established in urban areas (Guaynabo, Salinas and Vieques) and in a reference site (Fajardo) at the east coast. Particulate matter (PM) samples were collected in Teflon and quartz filters then weighed and processed. PM mass concentrations in Teflon filter were determined gravimetrically and estimated for quartz. Samples were digested for metal analyses with appropriate field blanks. Seven to eight metals (Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, V and Zn) plus arsenic (As) were analyzed in each sample by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. Average PM10 levels were around 25 μg m-3 in all sites being, lower than the limits established by USEPA (50 μg m-3). The annual average level of PM2.5 in Guaynabo was 11.6 μg m-3 versus 8.5 μg m-3 in Fajardo. Most of the metals were present at higher levels in the urban sites (Guaynabo, Vieques and Salinas) than at the reference site (Fajardo). All species analyzed in PM2.5, except Fe, were significantly higher at Guaynabo when compared to Fajardo. Ni and V exhibited the highest metal concentrations (Ni = 17 ng m-3 and V = 40 ng m-3) in Guaynabo. Fe showed stronger relationships between PM at each site suggesting their release from similar sources at that particular location, probably due to Sahara dust. © by PSP 2007.},

abstract={Type IV pili are surface-exposed retractable fibers which play a key role in the pathogenesis of Neisseria meningitidis and other gram-negative pathogens. PilG is an integral inner membrane protein and a component of the type IV pilus biogenesis system. It is related by sequence to the extensive GspF family of secretory proteins, which are involved in type II secretion processes. PilG was overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli membranes by detergent extraction and metal ion affinity chromatography. Analysis of the purified protein by perfluoro-octanoic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that PilG formed dimers and tetramers. A three-dimensional (3-D) electron microscopy structure of the PilG multimer was determined using single-particle averaging applied to samples visualized by negative staining. Symmetry analysis of the unsymmetrized 3-D volume provided further evidence that the PilG multimer is a tetramer. The reconstruction also revealed an asymmetric bilobed structure approximately 125 Å in length and 80 Å in width. The larger lobe within the structure was identified as the N terminus by location of Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid nanogold particles to the N-terminal polyhistidine tag. We propose that the smaller lobe corresponds to the periplasmic domain of the protein, with the narrower "waist" region being the transmembrane section. This constitutes the first report of a 3-D structure of a member of the GspF family and suggests a physical basis for the role of the protein in linking cytoplasmic and periplasmic protein components of the type II secretion and type IV pilus biogenesis systems.

abstract={Background: Surgical bypass and endoscopic stents are available for palliative bypass of malignant distal biliary obstruction. Aim: Comparison of reported outcomes in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which included surgery, endoscopic plastic stents or endoscopic metal stents in palliative relief of malignant distal biliary obstruction. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature and conference proceedings review to June 2006. Results: We found 24 studies, containing 2436 patients, which met our inclusion criteria. Endoscopic stenting with plastic stents (three studies) is associated with a lower risk of complications (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45-0.81), but a higher risk of recurrent biliary obstruction (RR 18.59, 95% CI 5.33 -64.86) than traditional surgical bypass. Self-expanding metal stents (seven studies) are associated with a significantly reduced risk of recurrent biliary obstruction at 4 months (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.3, 0.63), or prior to death or end of study (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39-0.69), but are not superior to plastic stents in terms of technical success, therapeutic success, mortality or complications. Cost-effectiveness outcomes were not suitable for meta-analysis. No other plastic stent designs have been demonstrated to be superior to polyethylene stents (12 studies). Conclusions: Endoscopic metal stents are the intervention of choice in patients with malignant distal biliary obstruction, producing similar outcomes to plastic stents, but with improved patency rates. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The least adsorptive and/or precipitative loss was obtained for borosilicate glass under most of the conditions employed, whereas the greatest loss was obtained for low-density polyethylene. Of the polymeric materials tested, the adsorptive and/or precipitative loss of PGE was lowest for fluorinated ethylene propylene (Teflon®). The loss of Pd(II) in freshwater was significant due to its affinity for surface adsorption and its relatively low solubility. The presence of natural dissolved organic matter increases the recovery of Pd(II) but enhances the loss of Pt(IV). The loss of Rh(III) in seawater was significant and was mainly due to precipitation, whereas Pd(II) recovery was enhanced, compared to freshwater, because of its complexation with chloride. The results have important implications regarding protocols employed for sample preservation and controlled laboratory experiments used in the study of the speciation and biogeochemical behaviour of PGE. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

These microbubbles are retained in diseased tissue where they produce an acoustic signal because of their resonant properties in the ultrasound field. Targeting is accomplished either through manipulating the chemical properties of the microbubble shell or through conjugation of disease-specific ligands for the targeted molecule to the microbubble surface. As microbubbles cannot leave the intravascular space, the disease process must be characterized by molecular changes in the vascular compartment to be imaged. Inflammation, angiogenesis and thrombus formation are central pathophysiologic processes in many disease states and produce phenotypic changes in the vascular compartment. Thus, targeted contrast ultrasound in the future could aid in the diagnosis of such diverse diseases as atherosclerosis, transplant rejection and tumor-related angiogenesis. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Employing a vacuum filtration method, we were able to successfully fabricate the DMFC anode with a good electrode structure using an in-house prepared Pt-Ru/CNT electrocatalyst. The catalyst layer was formed directly on a Teflon-treated carbon cloth having a buckypaper texture with a catalyst loading of 4.0 mg cm-2. From single-cell tests, excellent cell performances were obtained. At 80 °C, the power density was found to be as high as &gt;100 mW cm-2. This can be attributed to a thinner catalyst layer formed with a more efficient utilization of the catalyst than that using a low-metal-content counterpart, i.e., 20 wt%Pt-10 wt%Ru/CNT, as reported in an earlier study. However, the Nafion® ionomer content in the catalyst layer played a key role in the anode fabrication to obtain a good cell performance. In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with a constant phase element (CPE)-based equivalent-circuit model was employed to analyze the fabricated anode. It distinctively revealed some specific characteristics in the resistances and the interface properties. Overall, the obtained impedance results are somewhat different from those of a conventional DMFC anode with the catalyst layer coated onto a porous gas diffusion layer (GDL) on a carbon backing material. Based on the experimental results and the impedance analyses, the high-metal-content Pt-Ru/CNT catalyst was found to be much more favorable and suitable for use as a DMFC anode catalyst. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Materials for proton conducting membranes, electrodes and bipolar plates are described from the perspective of their suitability for longterm operation in automotive and stationary applications. The state-of-the-art PEM fuel cells consisting of perfluorosulfonic acid membranes, platinum-based electrodes and graphite(-composite)-based bipolar plates are in a well advanced state of development. Although the main constituents are in use for many years, impressive improvements in performance and lifetime have been realized, leading to cost reduction, size reduction, improved robustness and mass manufacturing. For the sake of system simplification, increasing the temperature of operation of the proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) would be beneficial. New materials are needed to enable operation at higher tem- peratures, and not less important, lower relative humidities. The suitability of present state-of-the-art materials for operation above 100°C is discussed, as well as a critical review of the suitability of emerging concepts. No alternative material that combines the virtues of the present materials with the ability of operation above 100°C has been developed so far. Therefore, the first commercial introduction of PEM fuel cells is likely to be based on the components that are at present in use, making use of perfluorosulfonic acid membranes. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Background: Periurethral or transurethral injection of bulking agents is a surgical procedure most often used for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence a common, troublesome symptom amongst adult women. Objectives: To assess the effects of periurethral/transurethral injection therapy in the treatment of urinary incontinence in women. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (28 February 2007), MEDLINE (January 1996 to March 2007, PREMEDLINE (7 February 2007) and the reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of treatment for urinary incontinence, in which at least one management arm involved periurethral/transurethral injection therapy. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality of each study using explicit criteria. Data extraction was undertaken independently using a standard form and clarification concerning possible unreported data sought directly from the investigators. Main results: We identified twelve trials including 1318 women that met the inclusion criteria. The limited data available were not suitable for meta-analysis. Injection of autologous fat was compared to placebo in a study of 68 women which was terminated early because of safety concerns. No differences in subjective or objective outcome were found in the two groups. No studies were found comparing injection therapy with conservative treatment. Two studies that compared injection with surgical management found significantly better objective outcome in the surgical group. Eight studies compared different agents - all results had wide confidence intervals. Silicone particles, calcium hydroxylapatite, ethylene vinyl alcohol and carbon spheres gave improvements equivalent to collagen. Porcine dermal implant gave improvements comparable to silicone at six months. A comparison of periurethral and transurethral methods of delivery of the bulking agent found similar outcome but a higher rate of early complications in the periurethral group. Authors' conclusions: Despite five additional trials, this updated review is still an unsatisfactory basis for practice. The trials were small and generally of moderate quality. The only evidence of benefit comes for within-group short-term changes following injection. The finding that placebo saline injection was followed by a similar symptomatic improvement questions the mechanism of any effects. There were no trials in comparison with pelvic floor muscle training -the obvious non-surgical comparator. Greater symptomatic improvement was observed after surgery, although these advantages need to be set against likely higher risks. No clear-cut conclusions could be drawn from trials comparing alternative agents; one small trial suggests that periurethral injection may carry more risks than transurethral injection. The single trial of autologous fat provides a reminder that periurethral injections can occasionally cause serious side-effects. Pending further evidence, injection therapymay represent a useful option for short-term symptomatic relief amongst selected women with co-morbidity that precludes anaesthesia - two or three injections are likely to be required to achieve a satisfactory result.

This present work was carried out to address this subject by evaluating the occurrence of significant aluminum migration from cooking utensils during food preparation. Eight types of food cooked in different ways and three distinct types of pans (a saucepan, pressure cooker and frying pan), with and without teflon coating, were evaluated. The metal analysis was conducted in an Optical Emission Spectrometer with Inductively Coupled Plasma. The results showed insignificant transference of aluminum in some food products. The main transference occurred when tomato sauce was prepared, which has a low pH, in the pan without teflon coating. The menu prepared with all the foods for two meals in a day showed that the aluminum mass incorporated by the food corresponded to 2% of the daily consumption limit of aluminum for a 60 kg person (1 mg.kg-1 of body weight per day). Thus, the use of aluminum pans in food cooking practically does not interfere in the total consumption of aluminum allowed for people.},

OTA is nephrotoxic and is suspected of being the main etiological agent responsible for human Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) and associated urinary tract tumours. Striking similarities between OTA-induced porcine nephropathy in pigs and BEN in humans are observed. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified OTA as a possible human carcinogen (group 2B). Currently, the mode of carcinogenic action by OTA is unknown. OTA is genotoxic following oxidative metabolism. This activity is thought to play a central role in OTA-mediated carcinogenesis and may be divided into direct (covalent DNA adduction) and indirect (oxidative DNA damage) mechanisms of action. Evidence for a direct mode of genotoxicity has been derived from the sensitive 32P-postlabelling assay. OTA facilitates guanine-specific DNA adducts in vitro and in rat and pig kidney orally dosed, one adduct comigrates with a synthetic carbon (C)-bonded C8-dG OTA adduct standard. In this paper, our current understanding of OTA toxicity and carcinogenicity are reviewed. The available evidence suggests that OTA is a genotoxic carcinogen by induction of oxidative DNA lesions coupled with direct DNA adducts via quinone formation. This mechanism of action should be used to establish acceptable intake levels of OTA from human food sources. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA.},

abstract={Introduction: Bacterial adhesion and colonization are complicated processes that involve many factors, including surface chemistry, hydrophobicity, and surface roughness, but the roles of these factors are not clear. The objective of this study was to modify hydrophobicity and roughness on one polymeric surface, and measure the corresponding bacterial adhesion and colonization changes. Methods: One- and two-dimensional mechanically-assembled (stretched) monolayer (MAM) methods were used to enhance hydrophobicity of fluoroalkylsilane (FAS) coatings on silicone. Surface roughness was varied with different abrasives. Surface hydrophobicity and roughness were determined by contact angle measurement and atomic force microscopy, respectively. Bacterial adhesion and colonization were quantified using scanning electron microscopy and direct colony-counting. Results: Hydrophobicity increased as a function of stretched length or width (Δx); it reached a maximum at Δx = 60% with one- and two-dimensional MAM and decreased as Δx increased to 80% and 100%. After 12 hr incubation, all of FAS/silicone surfaces significantly reduced the adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis from 42% to 88% compared to untreated silicone. Moreover, bacterial adhesion as function of Δx had an opposite trend, i.e. when hydrophobicity increased bacterial adhesion decreased and vice versa. Surface roughness had a significant effect on bacterial adhesion and colonization when the root-mean-square roughness was higher than 200nm. Conclusion: On FAS/silicone surfaces, bacterial adhesion was reduced significantly, and was inversely related to surface hydrophobicity. Moreover, a rougher surface promoted bacterial adhesion and colonization; however, there is a certain threshold (below 200nm) below which there was no significant decrease in bacterial adhesion and colonization.},

abstract={Previous studies have shown that the presence of surface irregularities, known as ulcerations, in carotid plaque is an independent risk factor for stroke. Doppler ultrasound (DUS) has not been implemented as a diagnostic tool for carotid plaque ulcerations. We employed carotid bifurcation flow models that differed only with respect to the presence of ulceration to study the sole effect of surface roughness on Doppler-derived flow parameters. A pair of in vitro flow models were fabricated, each based on an idealized carotid bifurcation geometry of 50% eccentric stenosis. For one of these models, a 2-mm diameter hemi-spherical ulcer was incorporated at the level of the apex on the non-flow divider wall. DUS measurements were acquired using a 4-MHz probe and 1.0-mm sample volume, delivering 4-D Doppler velocity data sets with 11.7-ms temporal resolution and 1.3-cm s-1 velocity resolution. Velocity data was analyzed for several indices. Teflon flow phantom facilitated both the direct machining of realistic vessel geometries with varying surface roughness (± 0.05-mm) and compatibility with Doppler ultrasound. The small 2-mm hemi-spherical ulcer did not introduce any significant differences in downstream velocity patterns, as indicated by turbulence intensity, peak velocity, or mean velocity. We have developed a DUS technique to characterize carotid plaque ulceration, and have shown that DUS velocity-based measurements of turbulence intensity are feasible with conventional systems. This approach will allow us to extend our paired comparison studies to other ulcer shapes and sizes. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, many studies have found a decrease in semen quality which has increased the focus on male reproductive health. Occupational hazards are by far the best documented in reproductive epidemiological research. Generally, occupational exposures have been divided into physical exposures (heat and radiation), chemical exposures (solvents and pesticides), psychological exposures (distress), exposure to metals and welding. The recent and/or most important epidemiological studies exploring the effect of occupational exposures on semen quality and fecundity, the ability to conceive, are reviewed. The evidence for an adverse effect on male reproduction of several occupational and environmental exposures and toxicants, such as heat, ionizing radiation, inorganic lead, dibromochloropropane, ethylene dibromide, some ethylene glycol ethers, carbon disulfide and welding operations, is strongly supported in well-designed epidemiological studies. For other agents, the association is only suspected or suggested and needs further evaluation before conclusions can be drawn. It is also important to bear in mind that many workers in the non-Western world still are exposed to substances that are banned in the Western world, sometimes in high concentrations. © 2006 Oxford University Press.},

Both experimentally proposed mechanisms (cyclic and open) were theoretically studied. For the case of the cyclic mechanism, the associative and dissociative ligand substitution alternatives were both analyzed. For the case of the open mechanism, the cis and the trans pathways were evaluated. All the reaction pathways were also studied taking into account the solvent effects by means of continuum models, for THF and PhCl as solvents. In selected cases, explicit solvent molecules were introduced to account for their potential role as ligands. Theoretical analysis indicates that the open reaction mechanism is preferred for organotriflate systems, whereas the cyclic mechanism is favored for the reaction with organohalide systems. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Background and purpose: Recently, a number of mimics of the second messenger cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) with replacement of adenosine by inosine were introduced. In addition, various alterations in the molecule ranging from substitutions at C8 of the base up to full replacement of the ribose moieties still retained biological activity. However, nothing is known about the metabolic stability and cellular effects of these novel analogues. Experimental approach: cADPR and the inosine-based analogues were incubated with CD38, ADP-ribosyl cyclase and NAD-glycohydrolase and metabolism was analysed by RP-HPLC. Furthermore, the effect of the analogues on cytokine expression and proliferation was investigated in primary T-lymphocytes and T-lymphoma cells. Key results: Incubation of cADPR with CD38 resulted in degradation to adenosine diphosphoribose. ADP-ribosyl cyclase weakly catabolised cADPR whereas NAD-glycohydrolase showed no such activity. In contrast, N1-cyclic inosine 5′-diphosphoribose (N1-cIDPR) was not hydrolyzed by CD38. Three additional N1-cIDPR analogues showed a similar stability. Proliferation of Jurkat T-lymphoma cells was inhibited by N1-cIDPR, N1-[(phosphoryl-O-ethoxy)-methyl]- N9-[(phosphoryl-O-ethoxy)-methyl]-hypoxanthine-cyclic pyrophosphate (N1-cIDP-DE) and N1-ethoxymethyl-cIDPR (N1-cIDPRE). In contrast, in primary T cells neither proliferation nor cytokine expression was affected by these compounds. Conclusions and Implications:The metabolic stability of N1-cIDPR and its analogues provides an advantage for the development of novel pharmaceutical compounds interfering with cADPR mediated Ca 2+ signalling pathways. The differential effects of N1-cIDPR and N1-cIDPRE on proliferation and cytokine expression in primary T cells versus T-lymphoma cells may constitute a starting point for novel anti-tumor drugs. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in 1999, 6% of hospitals reported a shortage of blood, resulting in the cancellation or postponement of surgical procedures. The many limitations and risks of transfusions of packed red blood cells in critically ill patients have facilitated interest in developing alternative agents for oxygen delivery. Over the past few decades, safe and effective substitutes have been in development. However, no currently approved agent provides both oxygen transport and volume in place of packed red blood cells. Oxygen therapeutic products have several advantages compared with packed red blood cells, including a prolonged shelf-life, lack of a cross-matching requirement, and minimal infectious risks or concerns about immunogenicity Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers and perfluorocarbons are being developed. Two products are undergoing clinical trials. Polyheme is undergoing a phase III study in trauma patients, and Hemopure is being evaluated in a phase II study in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. A third product (Hemolink) was being evaluated in a phase III study in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery; however, the trial was suspended. In addition, several other hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers are in the preclinical stages. Oxygen therapeutics have several potential clinical applications in the management of perioperative blood loss, trauma, acute normovolemic hemodilution, traumatic brain injury, and blood requirements in patients who refuse or have contraindications to transfusions of red blood cells.},

abstract={The analysis of metabolic pathways for dysfunction has been used for many years in the scientific and medical community to determine overall health. Metabonomics (metabolomics), the global profiling of metabolites, has experienced a rekindling of interest due, in part, to advances in analytical instrumentation for conducting measurements and informatics available for interpretation of the data acquired in this area of biomedical research. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) based approaches are two primary analytical methods of choice for conducting metabonomic measurements. To overcome the complexity and wide dynamic range of concentrations of metabolites present in biological samples, a common practice is to couple online an analytical separation, typically high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), with the mass spectrometer. Hence, of critical importance are not only the MS acquisition parameters, but also optimization of those variables that impact the analytical HPLC separation as well. A systematic investigation of a number of variables related to HPLC, such as mobile phase composition and flow rate, gradient time, column dimensions, and packing material properties has been conducted. The results of this study show that 10 cm long × 1 mm inner diameter (i.d.), C18 reversed-phase columns provide higher resolution than C8 or C4 columns for the analysis of urine samples. The results also show that longer columns and extended mobile phase gradients allowed detection of a greater number of metabolites. As expected, MS analysis of the same urine sample using positive and negative ionization modes resulted in detection of a different ensemble of metabolites. Though prior dilution of rat and mouse urine is a common practice in conducting HPLC-MS metabonomic analyses, our results suggest that a greater number of species may be observed using undiluted urine. The matrix (composition) of urine collected from different individuals affected the reproducibility of retention times. The variability in metabolite retention times using internal standards, although improved, was not completely corrected. Copyright © Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.},

Inertsil C8 was suitable as the column and the mobile phase was consisted of 0.1% formic acid-acetonitrile (80:20). These compounds were detected sensitively in a short time and separated from inorganic arsenicals and diphenylarsinic acid (DPAA) and phenylarsonic acid (PAA), which are degradation compounds of diphenylchloroarsine and phenyldichloroarsine, respectively. The detection limits of CVAA and CVAOA were 0.2 and 0.1 ngAs/ml, respectively. In addition, a dynamic reaction cell and oxygen as the reaction gas were applied, and then arsenic was detected as AsO+ (m/z 91) in order to prevent interference by ArCl+ (m/z 75). This method was applied to the analysis of urine obtained from a CVAA-administered mouse and CVAOA was detected as the main metabolite. Thus, the speciation analysis of arsenic compounds derived from chemical warfare agents was achieved by HPLC/ICP-MS. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, and π-π stacking, are increasingly being utilized to develop well-ordered and self-organized supramolecular materials. Recently, new types of nonclassical weak interactions, such as C-H∞π, C-H∞F-C, and C-H∞O, have been exploited in stabilizing the specific conformations of molecules and molecular assemblies in the solid state. These noncovalent interactions play an important role in materials comprised of polymer chains, because cooperative effects from a large number of weak interactions can lead to drastic changes in its conformation, several properties, and functionalities. The programmed design of synthetic helical polymer with well-defined molecular conformation has been the main subject in modern polymer science and engineering. Silicon-catenated polysilane is an ideal helical silicon quantum wire and polymers with unique photophysical properties. The present review highlights the spectroscopic evidences for through-space weak Si∞F-C interaction in poly(methyl-3,3,3-trifluoropropylsilane) (1) in noncoordinating and coordinating solvents by means of NMR (29Si and 19F) and IR spectroscopies, and viscometric measurement. It was found that 1 is applicable for chemosensors with an extremely high sensitivity and selectivity toward fluoride ions in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and with high sensitivity for nitroaromatic compounds, detected by a decrease in the photoluminescence intensity in THF and in thin solid film. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

L- or D- 18F-FMT, 18F-FET or 18F-FPT, prepared by 18F-fluoromethylation, 18F-fluoroethylation or 18F-fluoropropylation of L- and D-tyrosine, was intravenously injected into BALB/cA Jcl-nu mice bearing HeLa tumour cells. At 5, 15, 30 and 60 min post intravenous administration, the uptake of each compound in normal abdominal organs and xenotransplanted HeLa cells was determined using the tissue dissection method. Metabolic stability analyses of these compounds in the plasma were performed with the thin-layer chromatography method. In the plasma fraction, although L- and D-isomers of 18F-FMT, 18F-FET and 18F-FPT provided comparable metabolic stability, D-isomers of these labelled compounds revealed a faster elimination rate than their L-isomers, with a higher peak uptake in the blood and kidney 5 min post administration. Compared with natural amino acid ligands, such as L- 11C-methionine, the uptake of L-isomers of these labelled compounds was relatively low and stable in the abdominal organs, while D-isomers revealed much lower and faster clearance rates compared with the corresponding L-isomers. Among the abdominal organs, the pancreas showed relatively high uptake of all the labelled compounds used here, and the uptake of D-isomers was much lower than that of the L-isomers. Although tumour uptake levels of D-isomers of 18F-FMT, 18F-FET and 18F-FPT were almost 95%, 43% and 39% of the uptake levels of each of the L-isomers 60 min post administration, the tumour-to-blood ratios of these D-isomers were 181%, 137% and 101% of the ratios of the corresponding L-isomers. D-isomers of 18F-FMT and 18F-FET indicated improved tumour-to-liver ratios compared with the corresponding L-isomers, and D-18F-FPT showed the highest tumour-to-pancreas ratio among all the other compounds assayed here. These results suggest that D-isomers of 18F-fluoroalkyl tyrosine analogues are potential tracers for tumour imaging with PET. © Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract={Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is a common finding in pediatric practice that occurs in about 1% of children and is often familial, with several genetical loci probably involved. The majority of low-grade cases have a tendency to resolve spontaneously during childhood. However, VUR has been identified as a risk factor for the development of urinary tract infections (UTI) and is present in a third of young children presenting with this problem. In addition, some children with high-grade VUR have already renal lesions before the advent of any UTI. In a subset of affected individuals, these renal parenchymal lesions are associated with systemic hypertension and chronic renal failure but this risk is considerably smaller than previously assumed. In randomized trials of primary VUR diagnosed after urinary infection, prophylactic antibiotics are equivalent to anti-reflux surgery when subsequent renal lesions and UTIs relapses are used as endpoints. Controlled trials comparing the outcome of renal function in children offered either protocol or immediate treatment at recurrences are desperately lacking. This review article aims to summarize the extensive data regarding this controversial condition, to present rational investigation strategy and to analyze management attitudes in the light of the various lines of practice. © 2006 European Association of Urology and European Board of Urology.},

abstract={Nafion-coated bismuth film electrodes (NCBFEs) and Nafion-coated mercury film electrodes (NCMFEs) were used to electrochemically preconcentrate metal analytes for subsequent analysis by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Either type of electrodes is part of a thin-layer electrochemical flow cell that is positioned upstream of a microconcentric nebulizer for the ICP-MS. Performances of these electrodes were compared in terms of the analytical "figures of merit" (e.g., dynamic ranges, reproducibility, hydrodynamic stability, and elimination of matrix effects detrimental to ICP-MS). The coupled technique (ASV-ICP-MS) is found to possess a wide dynamic range (at least 4 to 5 orders of magnitude) and to be reproducible. Both electrodes are much more stable than the thin mercury film electrode (TMFE) traditionally used for ASV-ICP-MS, with the lifetime of the NCBFE exceeding 8 h. Adopting these electrodes for ASV-ICP-MS overcomes the problems associated with a TMFE, the erosion of which decreases the sample throughput, affects the analysis precision, and contaminates conventional glass nebulizers and spray chambers of the spectrometer. The medium exchange procedure inherent in ASV is successfully implemented with a two-valve flow injection system for the accumulation of trace Cd2+ into the electrode from a certified seawater sample, followed by stripping Cd into a solution that is compatible to the ICP-MS operation. © 2006 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.},

Clinical experience of liquid ventilation is limited, but improvements in oxygenation and lung function have been shown in short term studies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={BACKGROUND. Liquid Ventilation consists of partially or completely filling the lungs with a fluid (perfluorcarbon). This brings about elimination of the air-liquid interface and reduction of the surface tension in lungs with surfactant deficiency. This article focuses on the role of liquid ventilation in the treatment of acute respiratory failure in children. METHODS. A systematic review of literature was conducted using MEDLINE, LILACS and COCHRANE LIBRARY databases and references of articles. Match terms were: Liquid Ventilation, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Meconium Aspiration Syndrome, Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Randomized clinical trials, cohort studies and case control studies were searched for. Blood oxygenation, respiratory mechanics and survival were the outcomes evaluated. RESULTS. Two hundred eighty four publications related to liquid ventilation were selected during the study period: 19 (7.5%) were clinical trials and only six of them focused on the use of Liquid Ventilation in children. All six publications were characterized as phase I and II clinical trials and analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS. Upon analysis of these trials it was concluded that, because of the lack of controlled and randomized clinical trials, liquid ventilation cannot be recommended as a therapy for children with acute respiratory failure.},

abstract={Emission of various hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and greenhouse gases including perfluorocompounds (PFCs) from semiconductor industries, which individually may cause great impact on human health and the global environment, has attracted much public attention. In this paper, a potential application of nonthermal plasma technologies as an integrated approach for abating the emission of these gaseous pollutants is critically reviewed. Relevant studies indicate that direct electron impact with PFC molecules to form PFC fragment radicals is the first step leading to the destruction of PFCs in nonthermal plasmas (NTPs) and that further reactions of PFC fragments with radicals are essential for the effective removal of PFCs. Previous studies demonstrate that nonthermal plasma combined with catalyst or adsorbent has a good potential to be used as an integrated technology for abating PFCs frojn complicated gas streams of semiconductor manufacturing processes. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={To date, many processes have been used for the preparation of ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) artificial muscle membranes from conductive metals and perfluorosulfonic polymers such as Nafion. The most widely used of these methods is the platinum plating process, which involves chemical reduction of ionic salt solutions. Although these chemical electroding techniques produce IPMCs with outstanding surface electrodes and excellent performance characteristics, they are relatively costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we describe a novel fabrication process for fast preparation of low-cost Ni-Au-Nafion IPMCs. The process involves the formation of an adherent surface layer on prepared Nafion through DC sputter deposition of a fine-grained gold film, followed by electroplating of a thin and ductile nickel layer in a solution of aqueous nickel salts and boric acid. Preliminary results indicate that the Nafion-117-based IPMCs produced using this technique exhibit good surface conductivity and promising actuation performance, with 20 mg, 11.5 mm × 4.7 mm cantilever bending samples showing high displacements and tip forces up to 4 grams at 4 V. Our current research efforts are focused on achieving repeatable synthesis techniques and evaluating the properties and performance characteristics of the Au-Ni-Nafion IPMCs, especially in comparison to the popular platinum IPMCs. © 2006 Materials Research Society.},

abstract={Capillary liquid chromatography (cLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) have been critically compared for the separation of metalloproteins when using collision-cell inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-CC-MS) as detection system. For cLC separation, the selected column was a C8 (0.3 mm I.D.) and the separation conditions involved a gradient up to 80% methanol in 10 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.4). The low flow rate used (3 μL min-1) permitted the utilization of a high methanol content maintaining the sensitivity along the whole chromatographic run. For this purpose, a new low-flow interface has been developed based on a total consumption nebulizer. Similarly, CE has been studied as separation technique using a 75 μm I.D. fused silica capillary and a running buffer of 20 mM Tris-HNO3 (pH 7.4) and working at 30 kV. Metallothionein (mixture of MT-I and -II) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) have been used as protein models in order to evaluate the separation/detection capabilities using the same injection volumes in both systems (20 nL). For both hybrid systems, separation parameters such as retention factor, numbers of theoretical plates, tailing factor and resolution have been critically compared. Also, the analytical performance characteristics of both hybrid systems have been evaluated and tested by analyzing the Cu-, Zn-species present in red blood cell extracts in order to explore more adequate separation methodology for the analysis of metalloproteins in complex matrices. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The durability of various lubricants was compared using pin-on-disk experiments in high vacuum and using an accelerated tape tester in ambient air. It was found that PFPE lubricants were mainly degraded by tribochemical reaction and mechanical shear. The durability of Z-TETRAOL and A20H are higher than conventional PFPE lubricant and lubricant on experimental tape. By using ultraviolet light treatment and by applying a stearic acid overcoat, the durability of PFPE lubricants could be improved.},

The optimal method of intervention remains unknown. Objectives: To compare surgery, metal endoscopic stents and plastic endoscopic stents in the relief of distal biliary obstruction in patients with inoperable pancreatic carcinoma. Search methods: We searched the databases of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Group specialised register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CancerLit, Current Concepts Database and BIDS (September 2002 to September 2004). The searches were re-run in December 2005 and November 2008. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing surgery to endoscopic stenting, endoscopic metal stents to plastic stents, and different types of endoscopic plastic and metal stents, used to relieve obstruction of the distal bile duct in patients with inoperable pancreatic carcinoma. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials. Main results: Twenty-nine trials, that enrolled over 1,700 participants with pancreatic carcinoma, were included. Three eligible studies compared plastic stents to surgery. Endoscopic stenting with plastic stents was associated with a reduced risk of complications (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 - 0.81), but with higher risk of recurrent biliary obstruction prior to death (RR 18.59, 95% CI 5.33 - 64.86) when compared with surgery. There was a trend towards lower risk of 30-day mortality with plastic stents (p=0.07, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32, 1.04). One published study compared metal stents to surgery and reported lower costs and better quality-of-life with metal stents. &#x2028; &#x2028; Nine studies compared metal to plastic stents. Metal stents were associated with a lower risk of recurrent biliary obstruction than plastic stents (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.38 - 0.62). There was no significant difference in risk of technical failure, therapeutic failure, complications or 30-day mortality by meta-analysis. &#x2028; &#x2028; When different types of plastic stents were compared to polyethylene stents, only perflouro alkoxy plastic stents had superior outcomes in one trial. The addition of an anti-reflux valve improved the patency of Teflon stents. Authors' conclusions: Endoscopic metal stents are the intervention of choice at present in patients with malignant distal obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic carcinoma. In patients with short predicted survival, their patency benefits over plastic stents may not be realised. Further RCTs are needed to determine the optimal stent type for these patients.

abstract={Introduction: The indications for surgical repair of congenital brachial plexus palsy are controversial. Our objective was to determine the results of early brachial plexus surgery following obstetric-induced brachial plexus palsy. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the outcome of 58 cases of brachial plexus surgery. The indication for operation consisted of the presence of less than antigravity strength in the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscle groups at 6 months of age. Data gathered prospectively, previously, showed the likelihood of improvement with less than antigravity strength in these cases to be poor. Results: Follow-up data were obtained on 52 of the 58 cases. Overall mean follow-up was 2 years. Twelve patients had more than 3 years follow-up (mean 5.5 years, range 3-11.5 years). Significant improvement was seen in all injury patterns i.e., C5-C6, C5-C7, and C5-C8, T1. Greater than antigravity strength in the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscle groups was seen in the majority of cases at follow-up. Conclusions: Repair of obstetrical brachial plexus palsy in children at 6 months of age that is based on less than antigravity strength in the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscle groups produces improvement in functional capabilities. Children with obstetrical brachial plexus palsy should be referred soon after birth to a center that specializes in the treatment of this type of palsy. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract={Decomposition of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and related chemicals in subcritical water was investigated. Although PFOS demonstrated little reactivity in pure subcritical water, addition of zerovalent metals to the reaction system enhanced the PFOS decomposition to form F- ions, with an increasing order of activity of no metal ≈ A1 &lt; Cu &lt; Zn ≪ Fe. Use of iron led to the most efficient PFOS decomposition: When iron powder was added to an aqueous solution of PFOS (93-372 μpM) and the mixture was heated at 350 °C for 6 h, PFOS concentration in the reaction solution fell below 2.2 μM (detection limit of HPLC with conductometric detection), with formation of F- ions with yields [i.e., (moles of F- formed)/(moles of fluorine content in initial PFOS) × 100] of 46.2-51.4% and without any formation of perfluorocarboxylic acids. A small amount of CHF3 was detected in the gas phase with a yield [i.e., (moles of CHF3)/(moles of carbon content in initial PFOS) × 100] of 0.7%, after the reaction of PFOS (372 μM) with iron at 350 °C for 6 h. Spectroscopic measurements indicated that PFOS in water markedly adsorbed on the iron surface even at room temperature, and the adsorbed fluorinated species on the iron surface decomposed with rising temperature, with prominent release of F- ions to the solution phase above 250 °C. This method was also effective in decomposing other perfluoroalkylsulfonates bearing shorter chain (C2-C 6) perfluoroalkyl groups and was successfully applied to the decomposition of PFOS contained in an antireflective coating agent used in semiconductor manufacturing. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The objective of this study is to investigate the potential use of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) as physical solvents for selective CO 2 capture from post water-gas-shift reactor streams under elevated pressures and temperatures. A comprehensive literature review to select potential PFCs was conducted, and the equilibrium gas solubility, and the hydrodynamic and mass transfer parameters (gas holdup, Sauter mean bubble diameter, and volumetric mass transfer coefficient) for CO2 and N2 in three different PFCs, namely Perfluoro-perhydrofluorene (C 13F22), Perfluoro-perhydrophenanthrene (C 14F24), and Perfluoro-cyclohexylmethyldecalin (C 17F30), known as PP10, PP11, and PP25, respectively, were measured in a 4-liter gas-inducing agitated reactor. The transient physical gas absorption technique was employed to measure the volumetric mass transfer coefficient; and the gas solubility was determined when the thermodynamic equilibrium was reached in the reactor. The expanded liquid height method and a photographic method were used to obtain the gas holdup and the Sauter mean bubble diameter, respectively. The data were statistically designed and obtained in a gas-inducing, 4-liter Zipper- Clave agitated reactor, equipped with sight-windows in wide ranges of operating conditions: Pressures (6 - 30 bar), temperatures (300 - 500 K), mixing speeds (10 - 20 Hz), and liquid heights (0.14 - 0.22 m). The literature review revealed that the PFCs have low reactivity and high chemical stability due to the high energy of their C-F bonds. They have high boiling points and low vapor pressures because of the strength of the C-F bond and the high molecular weight. They also have no dipole and very low molecular interactions due to the repulsive tendency of fluorine atoms. The equilibrium solubilities (x*) of CO2 and N2 in PP10, PP11, and PP25, expressed in mole fraction, were found to increase with pressure at constant temperatures. The solubilities for both gases were greater in PP25 than in the other two PFCs due to its larger molecular weight when compared with those of the other two PFCs. Under similar operating conditions, the solubility of CO2 in the three PFCs appeared to be about 4 times that of N2, which was attributed to the closeness of the solubility parameter of CO2 to those of the PFCs when compared with that of N2. The results showed that CO2 is more soluble in the Selexol solvent than in the PFCs only at low temperatures (≤ 333 K). The Selexol process, however, is customarily operating at temperatures of about 312 K, indicating that the Selexol solvent would not be effective at high temperatures typifying those at the exit of the gasifier system. This study proved the thermal and chemical stability and the ability of the PFCs to selectively absorb CO2 at temperatures up to 500 K and pressures as high as 30 bar. The volumetric mass transfer coefficients (kLa) of CO 2 and N2 in PP10, PP11, and PP25, increased with increasing mixing speed, pressure, and temperature due to the increase of the gas-liquid interfacial area (a) and the liquid-side mass transfer coefficient (kL). The increase of the gas-liquid interfacial area with these operating variables was attributed to the increase of the gas holdup (εG) and the decrease of the Sauter mean bubble diameters (dS). The volumetric mass transfer coefficients of CO2 and N2 in the three PFCs, however, decreased with increasing liquid height above the impeller due to the decrease of the gas holdup and increase of the Sauter mean bubble diameter, which led to the decrease of the gas-liquid interfacial area. The volumetric mass transfer coefficients of CO2 in the three PFCs were found to be always smaller than those of N2 due to the smaller gas-liquid interfacial areas (smaller gas holdup and larger Sauter mean bubble diameter) of CO2 when compared with those of N2 under similar operating conditions. The volumetric mass transfer coefficients for CO2 and N2 in PP25 were smaller than those in PP11, and both were smaller than those in PP10, indicating that the volumetric mass transfer coefficients decrease with increasing the PFCs viscosity. Also, under the operating conditions investigated, the gas-liquid interfacial areas of CO2 and N2 in the three PFCs appeared to control the behavior of the volumetric mass transfer coefficients in the gas-inducing reactor (GIR) used.

abstract={Alginate is one the materials most employed in practice to make dental impressions. Substances like zinc, cadmium and lead silicate, which are included in several alginate brands with the aim of improving their physical, chemical and mechanical properties, are a source of serious concern as regards their toxicity. The most serious chronic effect of oral exposure to cadmium is renal toxicity. Assimilation of lead has deleterious effects on the gastrointestinal tract, hematopoietic system, cardiovascular system, central and peripheral nervous systems, kidneys, immune system, and reproductive system. Chronic oral exposures to zinc have resulted in hypochromic and microcyte anemia in some individuals. The aim of the present study was to measure the cadmium, lead and zinc contents of seven brands of alginate for dental use on sale in Brazil. The samples were weighed and placed in the Teflon cups of a closed-system microwave oven. Aqua regia (4mL concentrated HCI:HNO3, 3:1 v/v) and hydrofluoric acid (2mL concentrated HF) were added to the samples, which were then subjected to heating. The samples were then cooled to room temperature and diluted to 25 mL in deionized water in a volumetric glass flask. The samples were diluted in duplicate and analyzed against a reagent blank. The analyses were performed in an atomic absorption flame spectrophotometer. Neither lead nor cadmium was detected. Zinc contents ranged from 0.001% to 1.36% by weight. The alginates exhibited low contents of the metals under study and gave no cause for concern regarding toxicity; even so, it is advisable to monitor potentially toxic materials continually and to analyze their plasmatic levels in the professionals working with them.},

abstract={Epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to diesel exhaust and urban air pollution is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. 3-Nitrobenzanthrone [3-nitro-7H-benz[de]anthracen-7-one (3-NBA)] is an extremely potent mutagen and suspected human carcinogen identified in diesel exhaust and ambient air particulate matter. The main metabolite of 3-NBA, 3-aminobenzanthrone (3-ABA), was found in the urine of salt mine workers occupationally exposed to diesel emissions, indicating that human exposure to 3-NBA due to diesel emissions can be significant and is detectable. There is clear evidence that 3-NBA is a genotoxic mutagen forming DNA adducts after metabolic activation through simple reduction of the nitro group. Several human enzymes have been shown to activate 3-NBA and its metabolites in vitro and in cells to form electrophilic arylnitrenium and rearranged carbenium ions, leading to the formation of purine adducts at the C8 and N2 position of guanine and at the C8 and N6 position of adenine. The predominant DNA adducts in vivo, 2-(2′-deoxyguanosin-N2-yl)-3- aminobenzanthrone and N-(2′-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-3-aminobenzanthrone are also the most persistent adducts in target tissue in rodents, and are most probably responsible for the induction of GC→TA transversion mutations observed in vivo. It is concluded that these adducts not only represent premutagenic lesions in DNA but are of primary importance for the initiation of the carcinogenic process and subsequent tumour formation in target tissue. Indeed, 3-NBA is carcinogenic in rats after intratracheal instillation, inducing mainly squamous cell carcinoma in lung. The intention of this article is to provide a critical review on the potential genotoxic effects of 3-NBA on human health. However, in general, there is a need for more mechanistic studies that relate 3-NBA to all processes that are considered to orchestrate tumour development and of studies on the ability of particles to promote 3-NBA genotoxicity. Because of its widespread environmental presence, 3-NBA may represent not only an occupational health hazard but also a hazard for larger sections of the general population. For an accurate risk assessment more epidemiological studies on 3-NBA-exposed individuals and a broader monitoring of environmental levels of 3-NBA are required. © The Author 2005.

abstract={The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed brackish sea with only limited water exchange with the North Sea and, thus, the North Atlantic. This salty water reservoir with water residence time of approximately 25 years is contaminated with many inorganic and organic pollutants: VOCl (Volatile Organohalogen Compounds), HC (Petrolcuin Hydrocarbons), OPNP (Organophosphorus and Organonitrogenous Pesticides), OCP (Organochlorine Pesticides), PAH (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) and heavy metals. Our paper presents monitoring results and sea environmental pollution assessment of the Southern Baltic coastal zone- the area of the Gdansk Bay, based on the analysis of sea water samples. A set of various analytes were determined: PAH (16 analytes), VOCl (6 analytes), HC (9 analytes), OPNP (8 analytes), OCP (5 analytes), heavy metals (Zn, Cd, Ph, Cu). The results were subjected to full statistical evaluation. An assessment of sea environment contamination was made by characterization of pollution sources and the definition of intercorrelations between them. The characterization of major statistically important correlations between 45 variables was performed with the use of principal component analysis technique. From the performed PCA it arose that the factor configuration was similar for all sampling points and in all cases 5 factors explain over 60% of the data variance, and the statistically significant loading factors are higher than 0.7 (with p=0.05). Additionally, analysis of variance and time series analysis were applied to define important differences between chemical species' concentration levels in time and in accordance with sampling points' geographical location. As a result of time series analyses carried through with consideration to sampling points, there were no statistically important differences discovered in trends of changes from 1996 up to 1999 for any of examined groups of compounds.},

abstract={Each year, more than 4500 pregnancies in the European Union are affected by neural tube defects (NTD). Unambiguous evidence of the effectiveness of periconceptional folic acid in preventing the majority of neural tube defects has been available since 1991. We report on trends in the total prevalence of neural tube defects up to 2002, in the context of a survey in 18 European countries of periconceptional folic acid supplementation (PFAS) policies and their implementation. EUROCAT is a network of population-based registries in Europe collaborating in the epidemiological surveillance of congenital anomalies. Representatives from 18 participating countries provided information about policy, health education campaigns and surveys of PFAS uptake. The yearly total prevalence of neural tube defects including livebirths, stillbirths and terminations of pregnancy was calculated from 1980 to 2002 for 34 registries, with UK and Ireland estimated separately from the rest of Europe. A meta-analysis of changes in NTD total prevalence between 1989-1991 and 2000-2002 according to PFAS policy was undertaken for 24 registries. By 2005, 13 countries had a government recommendation that women planning a pregnancy should take 0.4 mg folic acid supplement daily, accompanied in 7 countries by government-led health education initiatives. In the UK and Ireland, countries with PFAS policy, there was a 30% decline in NTD total prevalence (95% CI 16-42%) but it was difficult to distinguish this from the pre-existing strong decline. In other European countries with PFAS policy, there was virtually no decline in NTD total prevalence whether a policy was in place by 1999 (2%, 95% CI 28% reduction to 32% increase) or not (8%, 95% CI 26% reduction to 16% increase). The potential for preventing NTDs by periconceptional folic acid supplementation is still far from being fulfilled in Europe. Only a public health policy including folic acid fortification of staple foods is likely to result in large-scale prevention of NTDs. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The NASA New Millennium Program's Geosynchronous Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (GIFTS) instrument provides enormous advances in water vapor, wind, temperature, and trace gas profiling from geostationary orbit. The top-level instrument calibration requirement is to measure brightness temperature to better than 1 K (3 sigma) over a broad range of atmospheric brightness temperatures, with a reproducibility of ±0.2 K. For in-flight radiometric calibration, GIFTS uses views of two on-board blackbody sources (290 K and 255 K) along with cold space, sequenced at regular programmable intervals. The blackbody references are cavities that follow the UW Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI) design, scaled to the GIFTS beam size. The cavity spectral emissivity is better than 0.998 with an absolute uncertainty of less than 0.001. Absolute blackbody temperature uncertainties are estimated at 0.07 K. This paper describes the detailed design of the GIFTS on-board calibration system that recently underwent its Critical Design Review. The blackbody cavities use ultra-stable thermistors to measure temperature, and are coated with high emissivity black paint. Monte Carlo modeling has been performed to calculate the cavity emissivity. Both absolute temperature and emissivity measurements are traceable to NIST, and detailed uncertainty budgets have been developed and used to show the overall system meets accuracy requirements. The blackbody controller is housed on a single electronics board and provides precise selectable set point temperature control, thermistor resistance measurement, and the digital interface to the GIFTS instrument. Plans for the NIST traceable ground calibration of the on-board blackbody system have also been developed and are presented in this paper.},

Its role and efficacy depend on factors related to the stent, procedure, and patient. Goals: To review the evidence in the literature in which settings plastic or metal stents are cost-effective, and whether adjuvant measures or patient-related factors affect duration of stent patency. Study: Using databases a literature search was performed for papers published from 1979 to April 2004. All retrieved papers reporting experimental or clinical observations were rated according to strength of evidence, and carefully analyzed. Results and Conclusions: Metal stents (Wallstent) stay patent longer than plastic stents (large-bore polyethylene with side-holes), overall median 250 and 110 days, respectively, and seem cost-effective in patients with longer than about 6 months survival, which cannot be accurately predicted. Antibiotics or choleretic agents do not prolong stent patency in clinical settings. In case of stent occlusion, indicated stent exchanges and insertion of a plastic stent, respectively, seem cost-effective in patients initially treated with plastic and metal stents.

abstract={Two annually laminated cores collected from Lake DV09 on Devon Island in May 1999 were dated using Pb-210 and Cs-137, and analyzed for a variety of halogenated organic contaminants (HOCs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, short-chain polychlormated n-alkanes (sPCAs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Dry weight HOC concentrations in Lake DV09 sediments were generally similar to other remote Arctic lakes. Maximum HOC fluxes often agreed well with production maxima, although many compound groups exhibited maxima at or near the sediment surface, much later than peak production. The lower than expected HOC concentrations in older sediment slices may be due to anaerobic degradation and possibly to dilution resulting from a temporary increase in sedimentation rate observed between the mid-1960s and 1970s. Indeed, temporal trends were more readily apparent for those compound classes when anaerobic metabolites were also analyzed, such as for DDT and toxaphene. However, it is postulated here for the first time that the maximum or increasing HOC surface fluxes observed for many of the major compound classes in DV09 sediments may be influenced by climate variation and the resulting increase in algal primary productivity which could drive an increasing rate of HOC scavenging from the water column. Both the fraction (F-TC) and enantiomer fraction (EF) of trans-chlordane (TC) decreased significantly between 1957 and 1997, suggesting that recent inputs to the lake are from weathered chlordane sources. PCDD/Fs showed a change in sources from pentachlorophenol (PeCP) in the 1950s and 1960s to combustion sources into the 1990s. Improvements in combustion technology may be responsible for the reducing the proportion of TCDF relative to OCDD in the most recent slice. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Data source: A thorough, computerized bibliographic search of the preclinical and clinical literature regarding the properties of helium and its application in pediatric respiratory disease states. Data synthesis: After an overview of the potential benefits and technical aspects of helium- oxygen gas mixtures, the role of heliox is addressed for asthma, aerosolized medication delivery, upper airway obstruction, postextubation stridor, croup, bronchiolitis, and high-frequency ventilation. The available data are objectively classified based on the value of the therapy or intervention as determined by the study design from which the data are obtained. Conclusions: Heliox administration is most effective during conditions involving density-dependent increases in airway resistance, especially when used early in an acute disease process. Any beneficial effect of heliox should become evident in a relatively short period of time. The medical literature supports the use of heliox to relieve respiratory distress, decrease the work of breathing, and improve gas exchange. No adverse effects of heliox have been reported. However, heliox must be administered with vigilance and continuous monitoring to avoid technical complications.

abstract={BACKGROUND: Traditional suburethral slings are surgical operations used to treat women with symptoms of stress urinary incontinence. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of traditional suburethral slings on stress incontinence alone or stress with other types of urinary (mixed) incontinence in comparison with other management options. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 22 December 2004), The UK National Research Register (Issue 1, 2001) and the reference lists of relevant articles. We hand searched the proceedings of the Brazilian Congress of Urology from 1991 to 2003, inclusive. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials that included traditional suburethral slings for the treatment of stress or mixed urinary incontinence. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All three reviewers independently extracted data from included trials onto a standard form and assessed trial methodological quality. The data abstracted were relevant to predetermined outcome measures. Where appropriate, a summary statistic was calculated: a relative risk for dichotomous data and a weighted mean difference for continuous data. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen trials were identified including 760 women of whom 627 were treated with suburethral slings. Five compared suburethral slings with open abdominal retropubic colposuspension (Burch/Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz) and one compared suburethral slings with needle suspension (Stamey). In six trials, different types of suburethral sling were compared with each other. Nine types of slings were included (Teflon, polytetrafluoroethylene, prolene used for transvaginal tape (TVT), porcine dermis, lyophilised dura mater, fascia lata, vaginal wall, autologous dermis and rectus fascia). There were no comparisons of suburethral sling with anterior repair, laparoscopic retropubic suspension, peri-urethral injections or artificial sphincters. One trial compared surgery (including slings) with anticholinergic medication.There were no statistically significant differences between traditional slings and other types of continence surgery, or between one type of traditional sling and another sling. Confidence intervals around the estimates were wide, reflecting the few data available, and so clinically important differences could not be ruled out. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The data on sub urethral sling operations remain too few to address the effects of this type of surgical treatment. Few trials are reported by authors in a complete fashion and most information came from abstracts presented in annual meetings. The broader effects of suburethral slings could not be established since trials did not include appropriate outcome measures such as general health status, health economics, pad testing, third party analysis and time to return to normal activity level. Data obtained from thirteen trials did not provide reliable estimates because of their sizes, and heterogeneity of designs, populations studied, and types of comparisons made.Reliable evidence on which to judge whether or not suburethral slings are better or worse than other surgical or conservative management is currently not available.},

Methods: Multiple databases were systematically searched. Using independent double review and published quality review criteria, articles were rated as good, fair, or poor. Treatment benefit data were tabulated and conclusions were based on the rated strength of published evidence. Results: In all, 49 studies met inclusion criteria. Barrier creams containing dimethicone or perfluoropolyethers, cotton liners, and softened fabrics prevent irritant CD. Lipid-rich moisturizers both prevent and treat irritant CD. Topical skin protectant and quaternium 18 bentonite (organoclay) prevent rhus dermatitis. Diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (chelator) cream prevents nickel, chrome, and copper dermatitis. Potent or moderately potent steroids effectively treat allergic CD. There were no macrolide immunomodulator trials that met inclusion criteria. This review did not include studies of children, animals, or non-English language publications. Conclusions: A limited number of interventions effectively prevent or treat irritant and allergic CD, but well-controlled, outcome-blinded studies, particularly in the area of allergic CD prevention are needed. © 2005 by the American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.},

abstract={Background. Although the ultimate success of aortic operations depends upon the integrity of graft-to-aorta anastomoses, little is known about different techniques used to assure their longevity. We report the incidence of reoperation for suture line disruptions arising from anastomoses using reinforcement with Teflon felt. Methods. Since 1987, 1475 patients underwent 2281 anastomoses in the thoracic aorta (mean 1.55/anastomoses per patient). All patients were followed with at least yearly computed tomographic scans, for a total follow-up of 6483.8 patient-years. Those requiring reoperation were reviewed retrospectively for evidence of suture line disruption. Results. Only 34 patients, with a mean age of 55.1 years old (range 26-85 years old) underwent reoperation for suture-line disruptions following vascular graft-to-aorta anastomosis using Teflon felt. The previous operation was a Bentall procedure in 15 (44%); ascending aorta replacement in 9 (26%); total arch replacement in 6 (18%); descending aorta replacement in 2 (6%); thoracoabdominal repair in 1 (3%); and sinus of Valsalva repair in 1 (3%). The incidence of suture line disruption was 0.0052 per patient-year, and 0.0034 per anastomosis-year. The mean interval between operations was 55.9 months (range 4-180 months). In 21%, the pseudoaneurysm originated from the proximal anastomosis; in 71% from the distal anastomosis; in 3% from both; in 3% from the innominate artery; and in 3% from a sinus of Valsalva repair. In only 1 patient was there evidence of infection. Reoperation involved ascending aorta replacement in 11 patients, and total arch replacement in 13 patients. Adverse outcome, such as hospital death or permanent stroke, occurred in 8% (3 patients). Conclusions. Use of Teflon felt to support aortic suture lines yields a very low incidence of suture line disruptions: 1 per 191 patient-years, or 1 per 296 anastomosis-years. Teflon felt reinforcement provides a secure, long-lasting graft-to-aorta anastomosis with minimal risk of infection. © 2005 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.},

abstract={This article critically reviews the fundamental scientific tools, as well as constructs cohesive schemes for potential applications, relevant to the molecularly-thin liquid film technology. Our focus is to understand the nanoscale dynamic behavior of thin lubricant films, relevant to the emerging field of nanotechnology, especially for achieving durability and reliability in the nanoscale devices. Our goal is to present a unified and hybrid description of perfluoropolyether (PFPE) experiment, mesoscopic interpretation, microscopic simulation tools, and molecular design tools available up to now. The experimentation and theory for the physicochemical properties of ultra-thin PFPE films are used to examine liquid film in the sub-monolayer to multilayer regime. Methods for extracting spreading properties from the scanning microellipsometry (SME) for various PFPE/solid surface pairs and the surface rheological characterization of PFPEs are examined. The interrelationships among SME spreading profiles, rheology, surface,energy, and tribology, are given. Mesoscopic theories, including thermodynamics of evaporation and flow, stability analysis, microscale mass transfer, and capillary waves are introduced to describe thin PFPE film dynamics. Estimation of thin film viscosity enhancement from vapor pressure suppression by dispersion force is reviewed. The method for experimental derivation of lubricant spreading profiles from contact angles is summarized. The implications of capillary waves, or thermal fluctuations, at the surface of polymeric lubricant films are also discussed. The lattice-based, simple reactive sphere Monte Carlo (MC) technique for examining the fundamentals of PFPE dynamics is illustrated. An off-lattice based bead-spring MC model is also introduced to capture a detailed internal structure of the PFPE molecules, and the molecular dynamics method is implemented for a full-scale nanostructural analysis of PFPE ultra-thin films. By systematically tuning the endgroup strengths of PFPE, we examined the physicochemical properties for thin liquid films of the various PFPE/ solid surface pairings. These tools accurately describe the static and dynamic behavior of ultra-thin liquid films consistent with experimental findings and thus are suitable for examining the fundamental mechanisms of lubrication in nanoscale devices. Application of the next generation head-disk interface design in information storage device is briefly considered. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

abstract={In this review, the evidence about the role of oxidative stress in the induction of hepatocellular carcinomas by peroxisome proliferators is examined. The activation of PPAR-α by peroxisome proliferators in rats and mice may produce oxidative stress, due to the induction of enzymes like fatty acyl coenzyme A (CoA) oxidase (AOX) and cytochrome P-450 4A1. The effect of peroxisome proliferators on the antioxidant defense system is reviewed, as is the effect on endpoints resulting from oxidative stress that may be important in carcinogenesis, such as lipid peroxidation, oxidative DNA damage, and transcription factor activation. Peroxisome proliferators clearly inhibit several enzymes in the antioxidant defense system, but studies examining effects on lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage are conflicting. There is a profound species difference in the induction of hepatocellular carcinomas by peroxisome proliferators, with rats and mice being sensitive, whereas species such as nonhuman primates and guinea pigs are not susceptible to the effects of peroxisome proliferators. The possible role of oxidative stress in these species differences is also reviewed. Overall, peroxisome proliferators produce changes in oxidative stress, but whether these changes are important in the carcinogenic process is not clear at this time.},

Chillan, a typical agricultural city in the central valley, is located in the southern Bio Bio Region of Chile. The Chillan Campus is located approximately 4 km north of the city's downtown. The aerosol monitor operated on the campus from 9 October to 9 December, 1998. The study employed an IMPROVE sampler with an Anderson PM10 inlet at 3 m collecting PM10 on 25 mm. Teflon membrane filters. The filters were weighed before and after sampling to obtain mass concentration, then proton induced X-ray emission and X-ray fluorescence analysis were used to measure the concentration of 22 elements to levels below 0.68 ng/m(3). Moderate aerosol concentration was observed (up to 116 mug/m(3)). The main aerosol particle source in Chillan is resuspended soil dust, which accounts for 55% of the PM10 aerosol. The presence of Br, Pb and V and other heavy metals in analyzed samples points to traffic emissions in the city. Aerosol associated with transportation activities accounts for 11% of the PM10 mass. Non-transportation organics, associated with hydrogen measured by proton elastic scattering analysis, are an important component accounting for 19% of the PM10 mass. Sulfate particles account for 3%. In addition, presence of several trace metals, including Mn, Zn, Cu, Ga, As, and Sr in our samples suggests the presence of industrial emissions in the city. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

These industrial sites represent the regional spread of the industrial belt in the NCT of Delhi. Solid waste samples were digested using aqua-regia and HF in air tight teflon bombs for the quantitative analysis of heavy metals (Hg, Pb, Cd, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu and Zn) by GBC model 902 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Hg was analysed using hydrid generator attachment. Beside this sequential extraction was used to fractionate five heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cd, Cu and Zn) into six operationally defined phases, viz. water soluble, exchangeable, carbonate-bound, Fe-Mn oxides, organic-bound and residual fractions to ascertain the relative mobility of these metals. The result obtained showed metal concentration to be in the range of Hg 0.42-2.3; Pb 23-530; Cd 0.14-224; Mn 494-19 964; Fe 35 684-233 119; Ni 192-1534; Cu 3065-10 144 and Zn 116-23 321 (all units in mg kg-1) in all the industrial areas studied. The fractionated toxic metals like Pb, Ni and Cd were observed to be in the range of 25-35, 15-50 and 40-50%, respectively, in mobile or bio-available fractions of solid waste.

abstract={The surface film of the hydrosphere covers more than 70% of the world's surface. The sea surface microlayer (SML) or "skin" of the ocean is a sink for natural and anthropogenic material originating from the atmosphere and the water column. Organisms living in this SML are called "neuston." Our knowledge of the biology of the SML is still in its infancy. Research of the sea surface microlayer requires the use of appropriate sampling techniques and strategies, and the question of what is the most suitable device has not yet been answered. In the present study, we have compared the efficiency of the Harvey glass plate (GP) and the Garrett metal screen (MS) to analyze a wide range of microbiological parameters in SML samples collected at two coastal stations in the NW Mediterranean Sea. Two types of membranes (Teflon and polycarbonate) were also used to collect bacterioneuston. The MS was the most appropriate technique for most biological parameters providing higher enrichment factors as compared to the GP and, therefore, the highest enrichment factors compared with underlying waters (UW). Control experiments with UW demonstrated that the enrichment reported for the MS was not biased by any selectivity of the sampler itself. Therefore, we recommend the use of the MS when the aim is to compare different biological parameters. In contrast, there is clear evidence that hydrophobic and hydrophilic membranes have an important drawback and should not be used for quantification purposes. © 2014, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography.},

abstract={To develop a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for imaging the 'peripheral benzodiazepine receptor' (PBR) in brain and elucidating the relationship between PBR and brain diseases, four analogues (4-7) of N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide (2) were synthesized and evaluated as ligands for PBR. Of these compounds, fluoromethyl (4) and fluoroethyl (5) analogues had similar or higher affinities for PBR than the parent compound 2 (K-i = 0.16 nM for PBR in rat brain sections). Iodomethyl analogue 6 displayed a moderate affinity, whereas tosyloxyethyl analogue 7 had weak affinity. Radiolabeling was performed for the fluoroalkyl analogues 4 and 5 using fluorine-18 (F-18, beta(+); 96.7%, T-1/2 = 109.8 min). Ligands [F-18]4 and [F-18]5 were respectively synthesized by the alkylation of desmethyl precursor 3 with [F-18]fluoromethyl iodide ([F-18]8) and 2-[F-18]fluoroethyl bromide ([F-18]9). The distribution patterns of [F-18]4 and [F-18]5 in mice were consistent with the known distribution of PBR. However, compared with [F-18]5, [F-18]4 displayed a high uptake in the bone of mice. The PET image of [F-18]4 for monkey brain also showed significant radioactivity in the bone, suggesting that this ligand was unstable for in vivo defluorination and was not a useful PET ligand. Ligand [F-18]5 displayed a high uptake in monkey brain especially in the occipital cortex, a region with richer PBR than the other regions in the brain. The radioactivity level of [F-18]5 in monkey brain was 1.5 times higher than that of [C-11]2, and 6 times higher than that of (R)-(1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-[C-11]methyl,N-(1-methylpropyl)isoquinoline ([C-11]1). Moreover, the in vivo binding of [F-18]5 was significantly inhibited by PBR-selective 2 or 1, indicating that the binding of [F-18]5 in the monkey brain was mainly due to PBR. Metabolite analysis revealed that [F-18]4 was rapidly metabolized by defluorination to [F-18]F- in the plasma and brain of mice, whereas [F-18]5 was metabolized by debenzylation to a polar product [F-18]13 only in the plasma. No radioactive metabolite of [F-18]5 was detected in the mouse brain. The biological data indicate that [F-18]5 is a useful PET ligand for PBR and is currently used for imaging PBR in human brain.},

abstract={Spo0A is the regulator of stationary-phase events and is required for transcription of solvent formation genes in Clostridium acetobutylicum. In order to elucidate the role of spo0A in differentiation, we performed transcriptional analysis of 824(pMSPOA) (a spo0A-overexpressing C. acetobutylicum strain with enhanced sporulation) against a plasmid control strain. DNA microarray data were contrasted to data from a spo0A knockout strain (SKO1) that neither sporulates nor produces solvents. Transcripts of fatty acid metabolism genes, motility and chemotaxis genes, heat shock protein genes, and genes encoding the Fts family of cell division proteins were differentially expressed in the two strains, suggesting that these genes play roles in sporulation and the solvent stress response. 824(pMSPOA) alone showed significant downregulation of many glycolytic genes in stationary phase, which is consistent with metabolic flux analysis data. Surprisingly, spo0A overexpression resulted in only nominal transcriptional changes of regulatory genes (abrB and sigF) whose expression was significantly altered in SKO1. Overexpression of spo0A imparted increased tolerance and prolonged metabolism in response to butanol stress. While most of the differentially expressed genes appear to be part of a general stress response (similar to patterns in two plasmid control strains and a groESL-overexpressing strain), several genes were expressed at higher levels at early time points after butanol challenge only in 824(pMSPOA). Most of these genes were related to butyryl coenzyme A and butyrate formation and/or assimilation, but they also included the cell division gene ftsX, the gyrase subunit-encoding genes gyrB and gyrA, DNA synthesis and repair genes, and fatty acid synthesis genes, all of which might play a role in the immediate butanol stress response, and thus in enhanced butanol tolerance.},

abstract={In February 1999, the National Cancer Institute of the US National Institutes of Health issued a communication stating that concurrent chemoradiotherapy should be considered as standard treatment for cervical cancer. This statement was based on the publication of five randomized prospective trials. On the basis of a critical review of these papers and others that identified different results, questions, doubts, and concerns have arisen about this therapeutic method. We analyzed the quality of the control groups managed with the standard treatment, noting data that may have altered these results, as well as analyzing the quality of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and treatment compliance. In light of this analysis, we believe that further trials should be carried out with fairly balanced prognostic factors to demonstrate beyond a doubt that concurrent chemoradiotherapy is superior to radiotherapy alone. In developing countries where resources are scarce, this type of tumor is found frequently. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy would involve increased costs and supportive care, taking away resources from other vital areas. Copyright © by Current Science Inc.},

The literature documenting research data was obtained through an Internet search of articles published form 1962 to 2002. Respiratory distress syndrome is a potential complication for any patient that has suffered damage to the lungs. It continues to carry a significantly high mortality rate, in spite of multiple conventional treatments currently in use. The latest clinical research has led to the development of a new treatment for the syndrome called liquid ventilation, whereby chemicals called perfluorocarbons are used as a medium to transport vital respiratory gases into and out of the lungs. Research on animal and human subjects has shown that liquid ventilation therapy can Improve lung function in certain patients with severe pulmonary dysfunction when conventional treatments have failed.},

This review article describes the problems of using cultured epithelial autograft and the advantages of using preconfluent keratinocytes. Despite the numerous delivery systems that have been reported, most studies are limited to animal wound bed models. There are a few small clinical studies that have demonstrated enhanced healing using mainly subjective methods. There is a need for controlled, randomized clinical trials to prove the efficacy of keratinocyte delivery systems. Proposals for the use of this technology are made.},

abstract={Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is used to selectively detect analytes with a high affinity for metal ions. The detection method is based on the selective monitoring of a competing ligand at its specific m/z value that is released during the ligand-exchange reaction of a metal-ligand complex with analyte(s) eluting from a reversed-phase liquid chromatography column. The ligand-exchange reaction proceeds in a postcolumn reaction detection system placed prior to the inlet of the electrospray MS interface. The feasibility of metal affinity detection by ESI-MS is demonstrated using phosphorylated peptides and iron(III)methylcalcein blue as reactant, as a model system. Methylcalcein blue (MCB) released upon interaction with phosphorylated peptides is detected at m/z 278. The ligand-exchange detection is coupled to a C8 reversed-phase column to separate several nonphosphorylated enkephalins and the phosphorylated peptides pp60 c-src (P) and M2170. Detection limits of 2 μM were obtained for pp60 c-src (P) and M2170. The linearity of the detection method is tested in the range of 2-80 μmol/L phosphorylated compounds (r2 = 0.9996), and a relative standard deviation of less than 8% (n = 3) for all MCB responses of the different concentrations of phosphorylated compounds was obtained. The presented method showed specificity for phosphorylated peptides and may prove a useful tool for studying other ligand-exchange reactions and metal-protein interactions.},

The analysis of oxaliplatin has previously almost exclusively been based on the determination of the platinum content in plasma or ultrafiltrate using flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). A new method for quantitative determination of the free fraction of the intact drug in blood ultrafiltrate is presented here. Blood was ultrafiltrated centripetally at 4°C and the ultrafiltrate was analyzed by liquid chromatography. Oxaliplatin was separated on a Hypercarb column using a mobile phase of methanol/succinic acid buffer pH 7.0 (9/1, v/v). Post-column derivatization was performed by adding N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate in methanol and with microwave heating of a Teflon tubing. The derivative was quantified by photometric detection at 344nm. The coefficient of variation of standard blood samples was 4.9 and 2.5% at 0.100 and 1.00μg/ml, respectively.

There is increasing experience in its use in management of anemia in the critically ill. Methods: This review focuses on clinical, experimental papers regarding erythropoietin usage in the critically ill from the Medline database. Data from our intensive care unit (ICU) were also included. Results: Anemia occurs commonly in the critically ill during ICU stay. Erythropoietin responses are blunted in MODS. EPO is an effective means of increasing haemoglobin and reduces blood transfusion. High doses 300-600U/kg of EPO produce erythropoietic responses within 6 days. For the general critical care patient, studies to date have not shown any increase in adverse events, nor any mortality benefit. Conclusion: Clinical indications include those in whom transfusion is difficult, such as Jehovah's witnesses, or patients with antibodies. Data in the critically ill support the use of 600U/kg subcutaneously weekly for 4 weeks, with adjuvant therapy of oral iron 300mg/day, vitamin C 100mg/day, folate 5mg/day and possibly vitamin E. We recommend commencing when Hct is less than 30% in patients likely to remain in the ICU beyond one week. Patients should be monitored for hypertension and haemoglobin response. Erythropoietin use is now established as an efficacious, easy to use and safe method of treating anemia in the critically ill.},

abstract={Utilization of synthetic materials in pelvic organ prolapse surgery, in order to achieve a tension-free repair, has become increasingly popular. Generally, the use of synthetic prosthesis, including those which are completely absorbable, such as polyglicolic acid (Dexon) and Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl), or non absorbable like Polypropilene (Marlex, Prolene), Teflon, Polytetrafluoroethylene terephtalate (Mersilene), and expanded Polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE or Goretex) has resulted in a significant reduction in post-operative pain, length of recovery period, and rate of post-operative recurrence. However, complications and results differ according to the mesh composition (monofilament vs multifilament), pore size, tensile strength and flexibility. We comprehensively reviewed the literature on the use of synthetic mesh in pelvic floor defect repair, using Medline. The conclusion is that the ideal material still has to be developed; in fact, synthetic mesh can provide durable, permanent support in pelvic floor reconstructive surgery, but the urogynaecologist must weigh the risk of complications when choosing to abandon the traditional surgical techniques that, though they are based on the use of weakened and/or damaged autologous tissue, withstand the test of time. ©2003, Editrice Kurtis.},

Chromatography was accomplished with a reversed-phase C8 column and fluorescence detection. A gradient mobile phase system was used. The buffer for mobile phase A consisted of 0.75 M ammonium acetate, 5 mM tetrabutylammonium phosphate (pH 6.0), and acetonitrile (86:14, v/v). The buffer for mobile phase B was identical to mobile phase A with the exception of the concentration (50:50, v/v). Precipitation of plasma proteins was performed with cold methanol. The linear range of detection of the lactone and carboxylate forms of SN-38, SN-38G, and APC was 2-25 ng/ml, and 5-300 ng/ml for CPT-11. The limit of quantitation for the analytes ranged from 0.5 to 5 ng/ml.

Spontaneous electron transfer (ET) from the nucleophile to the substrate has been observed in a few systems; light stimulation, electrodes, alkali metals or inorganic salt-mediation is used otherwise. There are systems that are totally inert or undergo rather slow substitutions by classical polar mechanisms. Their lack of reactivity is usually due to strain (cycloalkyl and polycycloalkyl halides), steric (cycloalkyl, polycycloalkyl and neopentyl halides), or electronic factors (unactivated aromatic, vinyl halides and perfluoroalkyl halides). For these families of compounds, the nucleophilic substitution can be accomplished by the SRN1 mechanism. Conversely, there is a class of substrates, for which substitution can be achieved through both polar and ET mechanisms; however, the ET pathway is favored in some systems (i.e.: alkyl halides with EWG). We propose to undertake a compilation and critical review on SRN1 reactions dealing with substitutions on aromatic substrates, cycloalkyl, bridgehead, neopentyl, vinyl halides, perfluoroalkyl iodides, aliphatic substrates with EWG in the α position and N,N-dialkyl-p-toluenesulfonamides. With this aim in mind, we expect to cover recent SRN1 substitutions, with an emphasis on the scope of the process in terms of synthetic capability and target applications.},

abstract={A rapid, sensitive and specific high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method using UV detection was developed for the determination of nine antiretroviral compounds commonly found in plasma from patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Analytes include indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, amprenavir, lopinavir, delavirdine, efavirenz, nelfinavir and its M8 metabolite. Analytes were isolated from plasma using tert.-butyl methyl ether and separation achieved via reversed-phase liquid chromatography on a C8 column with a gradient mobile phase. Detection at 210 nm provided adequate sensitivity. Limit of quantification is 50 ng/ml and all analytes demonstrated linearity across 50-10 000 ng/ml from a single 200-μl plasma sample. Recovery from plasma was consistently high (&gt;80%). This novel HPLC methodology allows us to simultaneously determine plasma concentrations of nine antiretrovirals, including lopinavir, in HIV-infected patients on a single HPLC system. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) in comparison with the standard surgical interventions currently used. Data sources: Literature searches were carried out on electronic databases and websites for data covering the period 1966-2002. Other sources included references lists of relevant articles; selected experts in the field; abstracts of a limited number of conference proceedings titles; and the Internet. Review methods: A systematic review of studies including comparisons of TVT with any of the comparators was conducted. Alternative treatments considered were abdominal retropubic colposuspension (including both open and laparoscopic colposuspension), traditional suburethral sling procedures and injectable agents (periurethral bulking agents). The identified studies were critically appraised and their results summarised. A Markov model comparing TVT with the comparators was developed using the results of the review of effectiveness and data on resource use and costs from previously conducted studies. The Markov model was used to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life-years for up to 10 years following surgery and it incorporated a probabilistic analysis and also sensitivity analysis around key assumptions of the model. Results: Based on limited data from direct comparisons with TVT and from systematic reviews, laparoscopic colposuspension and traditional slings have broadly similar cure rates to TVT and open colposuspension, whereas injectable agents appear to have lower cure rates. TVT is less invasive than colposuspension and traditional sling procedures, and is also usually performed under regional or local anaesthesia. The principal operative complication is bladder perforation. There are currently no randomised controlled trial (RCT) data beyond 2 years post-surgery, and long-term effects are therefore currently not known reliably. TVT was more likely to be considered cost-effective compared with the other surgical procedures. Increasing the absolute probability of cure following TVT reduced the likelihood that TVT would be considered cost-effective. Conclusions: The long-term performance of TVT in terms of both continence and unanticipated adverse effects is not known reliably at the moment. Despite relatively few robust comparative data, it appears that in the short to medium term TVT's effectiveness approaches that of alternative procedures currently available, and is of lower cost. As TVT is a less invasive procedure, it is possible that some women who would currently be managed non-surgically will be considered eligible for TVT. Increased adoption of TVT will require additional surgeons proficient in the technique. It is likely that some of the higher rates of complications, e.g. bladder perforation, reported for TVT are associated with a 'learning curve'. Appropriate training will therefore be needed for surgeons new to the operation, in respect of both the technical aspects of the procedure and the choice of women suitable for the operation. Further research suggestions include unbiased assessments of longer term performance from follow-up of controlled trials or population-based registries; more data from methodologically sound RCTs using standard outcome measures; a surveillance system to detect longer term complications, if any, associated with the use of tape; and rigorous evaluation before extending the use of TVT to women who are currently managed non-surgically.},

abstract={Basidiomycetes are an ecologically important group of higher fungi known for their widespread capacity to produce organohalogen metabolites. To date, 100 different organohalogen metabolites (mostly chlorinated) have been identified from strains in 70 genera of Basidiomycetes. This manuscript provides an update of newly discovered chlorinated metabolites described since 1997. Additionally, the biosynthesis, physiological role, environmental fate and significance of Basidiomycete organohalogen metabolites are reviewed. Novel metabolites include chlorinated methoxybenzene azoxyformamide, pterulones (chlorinated1-benzoxepins),chlorinated anisylpropanoids, tri- and tetrachlorinated phenols. Chlorinated p-anisyl metabolites (CAM) are the most ubiquitous and ecologically significant natural organohalogens produced by higher fungi. Evidence is presented indicating their synthesis from phenylalanine via the phenylpropanoid pathway. They are estimated to be produced at a rate of 300 g ha-1 year-1 in European forests inhabited by the common occurring mushroom, Hypholoma fasciculare. Organohalogen metabolites have several purposeful physiological functions ranging from antibiotic properties, metabolites involved in lignin degradation and synthons for biosynthesis. © 2003 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The friction coefficient of three types of PFPE oils at the initial stage was in the following order, FM15 < DS65 < BJ60, and after 3.6ks this order did not change much. The initial results can be explained by the high reactivity of FM15 with the alloy surface. The XPS analysis revealed that metal fluorides were formed on both the surfaces of the block and the pin after friction tests were carried out.},

abstract={In an effort to understand the pyrolysis and atomization behavior of Pb in a dilute blood matrix when determined using a tungsten filament electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometer (W-filament ETAAS), we directly coupled a W-filament ETAAS instrument (J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 2001, 16, 82) to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). The W-filament instrument was operated both as an electrothermal atomizer (ETA) and as an electrothermal vaporizer (ETV). The experimental arrangement was used to monitor simultaneously the analyte (208Pb), the permanent modifier (103Rh) coating the W surface, a surrogate for the organic components of the blood matrix (40Ar12C), and the metal atomizer (180W, 183W and 184W16O), while also measuring Pb by AAS pseudo-simultaneously. Electrothermal parameters used in the ETV/ETA experiments were precisely the same as those described previously (Spectrochim. Acta, Part B, 2002, 57, 727) for ETAAS work. This was necessary in order that the ICP-MS data could be used to observe the vaporization of analyte, matrix, modifier, and metallic atomizer throughout the electrothermal cycle. The purge gas used to transport vaporized material from the atomization cell to the ICP was Ar containing 6% H2. Pseudo-simultaneous ETAAS and ETV-ICP-MS measurements of Pb in blood were achieved using this experimental arrangement, with the MS signals appearing roughly 2 s after those by AAS, consistent with the delay caused by the 15 cm long Teflon transfer line connecting the two instruments. During pyrolysis, a strong signal observed at mass 52 is shown to be due to 40Ar12C; this signal increases as filament power for pyrolysis increases. When plotted, the data show the effective removal of much of the carbon-based matrix during pyrolysis, but without significant loss of analyte. In contrast, the pre-coated permanent modifier, Rh, is only lost during the final cleaning stage of the program in which maximum power is necessary to remove the carbonaceous matrix. However, when Rh is added to the diluent, it is lost even during pyrolysis, and at a much lower temperature. This explains why addition of Rh directly to the diluent yields no modification benefits, and why periodic re-coating of the filament surface for the analysis is necessary.},

abstract={The practice and theory of enantioselective complexation GC is comprehensively reviewed for the first time. A multitude of racemic oxygen-, nitrogen- and sulfur-containing selectands can be separated without prior derivatization into enantiomers by complexation GC on optically active metal(II) bis[3-(perfluoroacyl)-(1R)-camphorate] selectors. Peak inversion is obtained when the selectors with opposite configuration are employed. Applications pertain to chiral analysis in asymmetric synthesis, enzymatic reactions, pheromone and flavour chemistry. Although the use of enantioselective complexation GC has diminished recently with the advent of modified cyclodextrins in enantioselective GC, the inherent principles of enantiorecognition together with other enantioselective phenomena can be elucidated easily by complexation GC. Using the concept of the retention-increment R′ which allows the distinction between non-enantioselective and enantioselective contributions to retention, concise thermodynamic parameters of enantioselectivity -ΔD,L(ΔG) are accessible. The enantiomerization of configurationally labile enantiomers can be investigated and quantified by complexation GC. Four distinct enantioselective processes and four different coalescence phenomena have been discerned in complexation GC. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the sphingomyelin-ceramide signaling pathway may be important in proinflammatory-like responses in the intact brain. Effects of neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase), ceramide analogs, phosphorylcholine and ceramide metabolites were studied on rat brain cerebral (cortical) venule lumen sizes, leukocyte rolling, velocity and endothelial cell wall adhesion, microvessel permeability, microvessel rupture and focal hemorrhages using in vivo high resolution TV microscopy. Perivascular and close intra-arterial administration of N-SMase, C2-, C8-, and C16-ceramide, but not either phosphorylcholine, C6-ceramide, nervonic (C24:1) ceramide, lignoceric (C24:0) ceramide, C8-ceramide-1-phosphate, glucosylceramide or 1-0-acylceramide, resulted in potent, concentration-dependent constriction (and spasm) of cortical venules, followed by increased leukocyte rolling, decreased leukocyte velocities, increased leukocyte-endothelial wall adhesion, increased venular wall permeability, postcapillary venule rupture and, often, micro-hemorrhaging at high concentrations; angiotensin II, serotonin and PGF2α didn't demonstrate these characteristics. Pretreatment with either one of three different antioxidants, including inhibitors of NF-κB activation, or two different Ca2+ channel blockers either prevented or attenuated the adverse venular effects of N-SMase and the ceramides. Likewise, pretreatment with either a PKCα-β antagonist or a MAP kinase antagonist also attenuated the adverse venular effects. These results suggest that N-SMase and several ceramides can result in potent venular cerebrovasospasm, leukocyte-endothelial chemoattraction, and microvessel wall permeability changes in the intact rat brain. These proinflammatory-like actions suggest that N-SMase and ceramides could produce brain-vascular damage by reperfusion injury triggering lipid peroxidation, release of reactive oxygen species and activation of diverse signaling pathways: PKCα-β isozymes, MAP kinase and NF-κB. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The analytes and the internal standard (bumetanide, a high-ceiling diuretic) were extracted from plasma under acidic conditions by means of solid-phase extraction using C8 cartridges. This procedure allowed recoveries close to 80% for all these drugs excluding Candesartan cilexetil (70%) which presented adsorption processes on glass and plastic walls. The analytes and potential interferences were separated on a reversed-phase column, μBondapak C18, at room temperature. A gradient elution mode was used to carry out the separation, the optimal mobile phase being composed of acetonitrile-5 mM acetate buffer, pH 4, at variable flow-rates (from 1.0 to 1.2 ml/min). Fluorescence detector was set at an excitation wavelength of 250 nm and an emission wavelength of 375 nm. Intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations for all the compounds were lower than 8% except for Losartan (12%) and the method assesses a quite good accuracy (percentage of relative error ∼6% in most of the cases). The limit of quantitation for these compounds was 3 ng/ml for Candesartan cilexetil and M1, 16 ng/ml for Losartan and 50 ng/ml for Irbesartan and Valsartan, which allows their determination at expected plasma concentration levels. This assay method has been successfully applied to plasma samples obtained from hypertensive patients under clinical studies after oral administration of a therapeutic dose of some of these ARA II compounds. © 2002 Elsevier, Science B.V.

Metal surfaces mainly release oxygen and water independent of surface roughness, Ni plating, or elements. Other substances are not detected by API-MS or GC-MS. Since O-rings are indispensable to make gas-tight structures, several kinds of O-rings made of fluoro-compounds are tested. Black fluoro-rubber o-ring, O-ting F, is recommended from the view of organic out-gassing but Teflon-based fluoro-elastomer, O-ring A, is a good candidate in terms of the water out-gassing. Greases emit a large amount of out-gases even when the samples are not irradiated by 157 nm laser. As an adhesive, Adhesive A is recommended because of the fact that it does not release as much organic and inorganic compounds which may absorb 157 nm laser light.

Fatty fish and blubber of mammals may contain high concentrations of organohalogen substances (OHSs). Elevated levels of OHSs have been reported from the Faroe Islands, first documented in breast milk samples obtained in 1987. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in serum samples from pregnant Faroese women known to differ in their dietary habits. High concentrations of OH-PCBs and PCBs were found in part of the human serum samples analyzed, and the relative OH-PCB and PCB congener distributions were similar to those observed elsewhere. There was a wide span between the lowest and highest OH-PCB and PCB concentrations in the serum samples analyzed, with ranges of 19-1,800 ng/g lipid weight (lw) and 150-22,000 ng/g lw, respectively. The ratio of ∑OH-PCB/∑PCB averaged about 10% and varied little. 4-Hydroxy-2,2′,3,4′,5,5′,6-heptachlorobiphenyl was the most abundant OH-PCB metabolite in all samples analyzed, with four other OH-PCB congeners as dominating metabolites in the serum. More than 25 additional OH-PCBs were indicated. This study confirms the presence of high concentrations of organohalogen substances in populations or areas far removed from their sources.},

abstract={A continuous extraction method was investigated to remove MnII, FeIII, CoII and CuII from sodium borate as a pH buffer reagent. The removal of impurities in a reagent is very important to decrease the reagent blank value, which would determine mainly the limit of detection in analyses of metals. 5,7-Diiodooxine (HR) was used as an extraction reagent because it has a high distribution constant between the aqueous phase and chloroform. The extractabilities of metal ions by the proposed method {aqueous phase (100 cm3) and chloroform (40 cm3)} were estimated based on the metal concentration in a sodium borate solution determined by graphite-furnace AAS. In the present method, the HR concentration in chloroform was 1.0 × 10-3 M and the pH of the borate solution as a sample was 9.2. The organic phase containing the reagent and its metal chelates was transferred to a distillation vessel at a rate of 2.0 cm 3 min-1 after separation from the aqueous phase by a Teflon phase separator in an extraction vessel under high-speed stirring. The concentration of HR in the extraction vessel was then maintained constant by the addition of a fresh HR chloroform solution at a rate of 2.0 cm3 min-1. Above 99% of the metals as impurity could be removed after 40 min of extraction. The experimental behavior of the removal of the impurity by the present method agreed with theoretical curves calculated by using an equation derived in this study. The present method was applied to sodium borate to be reagent grade. The sodium borate obtained by the purification was used as a pH buffer reagent to determine zinc by a chemiluminescence method. Furthermore, the effect of purified sodium borate on the blank value was examined by a catalytic analysis. As a result, very low values of the reagent blank were observed by each method.},

In NCo, Co2+ is octahedrally coordinated to the carbonyl oxygen of the pyridone ring and to five water molecules. In NMn and NCo, the molecular conformations of the nedocromil anion are similar, with the carboxylate group on C2 almost in the same plane as the tricyclic ring, whereas the group on C8 is twisted out of the tricyclic plane. Thermal analytical data for NMn show that the water molecules in this hydrate are lost in two steps, of 4 mol and 1 mol of water, respectively. NCo also gave two dehydration steps but of about 6 mol of water and 1 mol of water, respectively.},

Whereas traditional metal-binding ligands dissolve in CO2 at moderate pressures, the resulting complexes [(LH+)2MClx2-] exhibit negligible solubility in CO2 at pressures up to 400 atm. Consequently, we have designed and synthesized a series of highly CO2-soluble analogues to the metal-binding ligands currently used by the PGM-refining industry. We have measured equilibrium efficiency factors for various ligands and ligands bound to platinum. We have found that the structure of the CO2-philic component of the ligand affects the binding constant and hence that fluoroalkyls are better extractants of platinum than fluoroethers. Finally, we have noted that the phase behavior of the ligand-metal complex is a function of both the ligand structure and the identity of the metal, opening the possibility for separations based on both pressure and ligand selectivity.},

abstract={Because of difficulties or dubious results with previously published methodologies, a new semi-automated HPLC method with UV absorbance detection was developed and applied to the determination of bradykinin (BK) in human saliva. The new method consisted of an uncomplicated sample preparation involving the addition to saliva of an equal volume of 0.1 M orthophosphoric acid to stabilize BK, vortex-mixing, centrifugation, and separation, followed by chromatography of the supernatant phase on a C8, 150×3.9-mm (I.D.) stainless steel column. The mobile phase was composed of 19% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at flow-rate of 0.4 ml/min. Using UV detection at 220 nm, the detection limit was 1 ng/ml for the BK standard, and 7 ng/ml for the assay of endogenous salivary BK. The orthophosphoric acid initially added to the saliva allowed BK to be stabilized from enzymic degradation at 20°C for 5 days and at 4°C for 60 days. Assignment made to the peak with the chromatographic properties of salivary BK was confirmed by HPLC-MS with an electrospray interface. This paper presents a new method that is reproducible, reliable and allows kinetic studies of salivary BK to be performed for clinical investigations. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={A series of studies has been carried out on the effect of refluxing silica chromatography particles for 0.5 h and 18 h in water, dilute hydrochloric acid and dilute hydrofluoric acid. The bulk and surface trace metal concentrations were measured by inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SSIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to determine changes in 'isolated' and 'bonded' silanol groups. The chromatographic behaviour of a series of weakly basic analytes was investigated on C8 and C18 bonded phases manufactured from the acid-treated silicas. The different reflux treatments all resulted in a reduction in the numbers of isolated silanols compared with the untreated silica and SSIMS analysis suggested that the HF-treated silicas had undergone a more efficient surface rehydroxylation. Bulk trace metals were removed most effectively by the HF treatment, with the multivalent elements (Ti and Al) being the most difficult to remove. Surface specific analysis suggested that trace metals were removed more rapidly from the surface of the silica compared to the bulk matrix and that the acid treatments resulted in halide contamination of the silica surface. Evidence is presented to suggest that the bulk metal content of the silica is not representative of the concentration of metals at the chromatographic surface. The chromatographic investigations showed that the HF-treated silica gave substantially better performance towards weak bases than the HCl-treated silicas. Copyright (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The spectrophotometric determination of trace amounts of iron and cobalt was investigated for flow injection analysis. Cationic or polarized metal chelates were concentrated on a Teflon surface, which was treated with a 2 M NaOH solution for 3 hours. Then, the metal chelates adsorbed in the Teflon capillary tube were eluted with a solvent mixture of ethanol and 0.1 M HNO3, and determined by on-line by spectrophotometry. Cobalt(III) reacted with tridentate ligands to form stable chelate complexes, which have cationic charge in the complexes. 2-(5-Bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-[N-n-propyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl)amino]aniline, sodium salt (5-Br-PSAA) and 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphtol (PAN) were used to form cationic complexes as tridentate and mono valence ligands. The composition of the complexes obtained under the standard conditions was metal : ligand = 1 : 2. The metal complexes were concentrated for 10 min with 2.9 ml/min as the flow rate of the sample solution. As a result, the apparent molar absorption coefficients of the complexes were enhanced to 100 times as compared to each of there molar absorption coefficients. The optimum conditions were as follows: chelate complex preparation pH, 4.7; concentration pH, 8.9; eluent flow rate, 0.7 ml/min; measurement wavelength, 602 nm (Co-5-Br-PSAA), 554 nm (Fe-5-Br-PSAA), and 585 nm (Co-PAN), concentration tube length, 6 m. The cobalt was determined over the range 0.6∼50 ppb with PAN and 0.3∼10 ppb with 5-Br-PSAA; iron(III) was 0.1∼10 ppb with 5-Br-PSAA. The result of determination of iron (III) in tap water showed good agreement with the values obtained by ICP-AES. © 2001 The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry.},

abstract={Metabolic pathways of the mutagen 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) remain incompletely characterized in humans. In this study, the metabolism of MeIQx was investigated in primary human hepatocytes. Six metabolites were characterized by UV and mass spectroscopy. Novel metabolites were additionally characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The carcinogenic metabolite, 2-(hydroxyamino)-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, which is formed by cytochrome P450 1A2 (P450 1A2), was found to be transformed into the N2-glucuronide conjugate, N2-(β-1-glucosiduronyl)-2-(hydroxyamino)-3,8-dimethylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoxaline. The phase II conjugates N2-(3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxalin-2-yl)sulfamic acid and N2-(β-1-glucosiduronyl)-2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoxaline, as well as the 7-oxo derivatives of MeIQx and N-desmethyl-MeIQx, 2-amino-3,8-dimethyl-6-hydro-7H-imidazo-[4,5-f]quinoxalin-7-one (7-oxo-MeIQx), and 2-amino-6-hydro-8-methyl-7H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxalin-7-one (N-desmethyl-7-oxe-MeIQx), thought to be formed exclusively by the intestinal flora, were also identified. A novel metabolite was characterized as 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline-8-carboxylic acid (IQx-8-COOH), and it was the predominant metabolite formed in hepatocytes exposed to MeIQx at levels approaching human exposure. IQx-8-COOH formation is catalyzed by P450 1A2. This metabolite is a detoxication product and does not induce umuC gene expression in Salmonella typhimurium strain NM2009. IQx-8-COOH is also the principal oxidation product of MeIQx excreted in human urine [Turesky, R., et al. (1998) Chem. Res. Toxicol. 11, 217-225]. Thus, P450 1A2 is involved in both the metabolic activation and detoxication of this procarcinogen in humans. Analogous metabolism experiments were conducted with hepatocytes of untreated rats and rats pretreated with the P450 inducer 3-methycholanthrene. Unlike human hepatocytes, the rat cell preparations did not produce IQx-8-COOH but catalyzed the formation of 2-amino-3,8-dimethyl-5-hydroxyimidazo[4,5-f]-quinoxaline as a major P450-mediated detoxication product. In conclusion, our results provide evidence of a novel MeIQx metabolism pathway in humans through P450 1A2-mediated C8-oxidation of MeIQx to form IQx-8-COOH. This biotransformation pathway has not been detected in experimental animal species. Considerable interspecies differences exist in the metabolism of MeIQx by P450s, which may affect the biological activity of this mutagen and must be considered when assessing human health risk.},

abstract={The gravimetric and chemical composition of fugitive dust emitters of Mexico City were analyzed to determine the particulate matter source profiles. Samples of geological material, unpaved and paved roads, agricultural soil, dried lake, asphalt, cement plants, landfill, gravel, and tezontle soil, were collected directly from the ground using a broom and a dustpan. These were dried, sieved and taken through a laboratory resuspension chamber to emulate the natural wind-blown processes of bulk soils and also to provide a uniform deposit on Teflon membrane and quartz fiber filters for further gravimetric and chemical analyses of PM2.5 and PM10 size fractions. Chemical analyses of the filters included X-ray fluorescence for elemental composition, ion chromatography for water soluble anions, atomic absorption for water soluble metals, automated colorimetric analysis for ammonium and thermal/optical reflectance analysis for carbon species. The data show that most fugitive emitters are composed of 20-30% PM2.5, which is relatively less than the reported contribution by fossil fuels and biomass (40-60%).

This paper provides an overview of the tests performed on the returned metallized Teflon FEP along with a summary of results. Testing including determination of mechanical and optical properties, crystallinity and fractography. Because of the amount of material retrieved and the nominal environmental exposures of the retrieved materials, these analyses resulted in a fairly complete understanding of the degradation process affecting the materials on the telescope. Test results from SM3A materials showed significantly better mechanical strength than second servicing mission (SM2) samples.},

These chemicals are referred to as endocrine disruptors or environmental hormones, and a variety of chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, pesticides such as DDT, plastic additives such as bisphenol A, detergent additives such as alkylphenols are listed as the endocrine disruptors. It has also been shown that specific hydroxylated PCBs interact with the estrogen hormone and thyroid hormone systems. Several hydroxylated PCBs metabolites, which structure is resemble to that of thyroid hormone, thyroxine (T4), are determined in human blood. These observations indicate the significance of hydroxylated PCBs metabolites as potential endocrine disruptors in human. This paper reviews the metabolism of PCBs, endocrine-disrupting effects of hydroxylated PCBs based on interactions with estrogen hormone metabolism, thyroid hormone metabolism and the chemical analysis of phenolic organohalogen compounds such as hydroxylated PCBs. Measurement of estrogenic activities of hydroxylated PCBs by bioassay (yeast two-hybrid assay) is also presented.},

abstract={A sensitive negative ion chemical ionization (NCI) gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) method was modified for the quantitation of valproic acid (VPA) metabolites generated from in vitro cDNA-expressed human microsomal cytochrome P450 incubations. The use of the inherent soft ionization nature of electron-capture NCI to achieve high sensitivity enabled us to conduct kinetic studies using small amounts of recombinant human P450 enzymes. The assay is based on the selective ion monitoring of the intense [M-181] fragments of pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) esters in the NCI mode, and has the following features: (1) a micro-extraction procedure to isolate VPA metabolites from small incubation volumes (100 μl); (2) a second step derivatization with tert.-butyldimethylsilylating reagents to enhance sensitivity for hydroxylated metabolites; (3) a short run-time (&lt;30 min) while maintaining full separation of 15 VPA metabolites by using a narrow-bore non-polar DB-1 column plus a new temperature gradient; and (4) good reproducibility and accuracy (intra- and inter-assay RSDs &lt;15%, bias &lt;15%) by using seven deuterated derivatives of analytes as internal standards. The derivatives of mono- and diunsaturated metabolites, like the parent drug, produced abundant [M-181]- ions while the hydroxylated metabolites gave an ion at m/z of 273, corresponding to the [M-181]- ion of the tert.-butyldimethylsilyl ethers. In conclusion, the GC-NCI-MS analysis of valproate metabolites provided us with a high resolution and sensitivity necessary to conduct metabolic and kinetic studies of valproic acid in small volume samples typical of the in vitro cDNA-expressed micro-incubation enzymatic systems. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Clearly, PLV is feasible in patients with ALI and ARDS, and it appears to be safe with respect to short-term effects on hemodynamics and lung physiology, as well as long-term toxicity (although further research in this area is warranted). Although PLV has not yet been proven to be superior to traditional mechanical ventilation for patients with ALI or ARDS, PLV possesses an intriguing combination of physical, physiologic, and biologic effects: 'Liquid PEEP' effect - e.g., more effective recruitment of dependent lung zones than achieved by gas ventilation Anti-inflammatory effects Lavage of alveolar debris Mitigation of ventilator-induced lung injury Direct anti-inflammatory effects - e.g., decreased macrophage release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, etc. Prevention of nosocomial pneumonia Combination with other modalities - e.g., exogenous surfactant replacement, inhaled NO, prone position Enhanced delivery of drugs or gene vectors into the lung The results of ongoing and future clinical trials will be necessary to establish whether PLV improves clinical outcomes in patients with ALI or ARDS, or specific subgroups of such patients. Significant work also remains to be done to define the optimum dose level of PLV and the most appropriate ventilatory strategies.},

Endoscopie assisted microsurgical tumour removal offers an unobstructed panoramic view and allows "looking around the corner" and beyond the tumour. After tumour removal, it allows a safe and sure control of the internal auditory canal and of any bleeding. Endoscopie assisted microvascular decompression offers an atraumatic and precise guidance to the site of pathology, without excessive brain stem retraction, keeping intact the neurovascular relationships. Again at the end of surgery it allows a control of the efficiency of the microsurgical decompression without disturbing to the correct position of the Teflon pad.},

abstract={This paper describes a methodological approach for the assessment of the amount of surrogate dry deposition of several toxic heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) associated with atmospheric particulate matter at ground level. The objectives of the study were twofold: i) the evaluation of several techniques for the digestion of dry deposition samples for trace metal analysis; ii) the comparison of the results from two samplers with different collecting surfaces. A dry solid surface sampler (DRY sampler, Andersen - USA) and a water layer surface sampler (DAS sampler - MTX Italy) were employed. The samples were collected over a one-year period in an urban site of Bologna (northern Italy). A description is given of the complete procedure, from sampling to data elaboration, including sample storage, digestion and analytical methods. According to the results obtained with three different digestion techniques (Teflon bomb, microwave digester and Teflon flask with vapour cooling system), the highest recovery rate was achieved by the Teflon bomb procedure employing an NBS 1648 Standard Reference Material; 90-95% of the elements considered were recovered by dissolution in a pressurized Teflon bomb with an HNO3-HF mixture. Given these results, the technique was adopted for dry deposition sample digestion. On the basis of the amount of heavy metals measured as monthly deposition fluxes (μg/m2), the collecting efficiency of the DAS sampler for a number of elements was found to be as much as two to three times greater than that of the DRY sampler.},

abstract={Vehicular suspension ball joints can be categorized in the family of tribological systems which can reduce useful service or working capacity through malfunction or breakdown. Detailed metallurgical analysis of the friction and wear mechanisms on typical ball joint bearing surfaces point to a Teflon-based woven fabric, self-lubricating liner as the best bearing material for the joint. Laboratory functional testing was conducted on modern, 4-axis test equipment simulating the applicable loading and motion conditions typically encountered in use. The self-lubricated bearing liner woven with Teflon thread demonstrated higher sustained load capacity, less rotating friction, excellent torque retention qualities and extended life in comparison to existing components utilizing greased metal-on-metal and/or "plastic" bearing materials. This paper describes how the advanced Fiberglide® liner technology and redesigned suspension ball joint provides superior performance and maintenance-free operation at attractive costs for mass-produced vehicle applications.

The purpose of the first was to determine the location and extent of metals contamination throughout the base. The objective of the second was to evaluate the risk of metals contamination to groundwater from soil at three locations within the airfield. Dynamic workplans were developed and an adaptive sampling and analysis plan carried out with the data produced in the field used to support the goals of each project. An inductively coupled plasma/optical emission spectrometer (ICP/OES) was modified for field operation. A more efficient microwave digestion method and pressurized Teflon filtration system were developed for the HAFB project. Results were comparable to standard Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) methods, which must rely on two digestion procedures to recover EPA-targeted metals within the prescribed recovery range. The MCAS investigation, conducted over a five-month period, advanced the Navy's efforts from 30 months behind schedule to 18 months ahead of schedule, while the data generated at HAFB showed no risk to groundwater from metals. © 1999 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company.},

First, an enhancement of the CL emission was observed upon mixing the VO(acac)2 complex in chloroform with the CTAC reversed micellar solution of luminol, even when hydrogen peroxide was absent. The free VO(IV) ion produced transiently from decomposition of the complex at the reversed micellar interface is considered to catalyze the CL oxidation of luminol by dissolved oxygen. Secondly, the CL detection based on the luminoi-hydrogen peroxide CL emission, enhanced by the Fe(oxine)3 complex in reverse micelles, was combined with on-line extraction through the formation of the complex, followed by separation through a microporous Teflon membrane. In a sample solution containing Fe(II) and Fe(III), the addition of a reaction process using hydrogen peroxide to oxidize Fe(II) to Fe(III) prior to the extraction in this flow system provides for the determination of total iron, Fe(II) + Fe(III), while only Fe(III) can be determined by the absence of hydrogen peroxide.},

The focus is on reaction mechanisms and kinetics of the water-gas shift and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactions. New developments in the product selectivity as well as the overall kinetics are reviewed. It is concluded that the development of rate equations for the FTS should be based on realistic mechanistic schemes. Qualitatively, there is agreement that the product distribution is affected by the occurrence of secondary reactions (hydrogenation, isomerization, reinsertion, and hydrogenolysis). At high CO and H2O pressures, the most important secondary reaction is readsorption of olefins, resulting in initiation of chain growth processes. Secondary hydrogenation of α-olefins may occur and depends on the catalytic system and the process conditions. The rates of the secondary reactions increase exponentially with chain length. Much controversy exists about whether these chain-length dependencies stem from differences in physisorption, solubility, or diffusivity. Preferential physisorption of longer hydrocarbons and increase of the solubility with chain length influences the product distribution and results in a decreasing olefin-to-paraffin ratio with increasing chain length. Process development and reactor design should be based on reliable kinetic expressions and detailed selectivity models.},

This study reports on the application of the immobilized β-glucuronidase column to the analysis of glucuronide metabolites in the urine. The system utilized in this work was composed of an internal-surface reversed-phase (ISRP) column (50x4.6 mm) containing a hydrophobic inner phase and a hydrophilic outer phase, a β-glucuronidase immobilized enzyme reactor (BG-IMER) column (50x4.6 mm) and a C8 reversed-phase column (150x4.6 mm). The columns were connected with three six-port switching valves. A coupled-column procedure was developed for urine samples containing chloramphenicol-β-d-glucuronides (0.07-1.1 mM/injection). Urine samples were injected into the ISRP column where the glucuronides were separated from the biological matrix, with matrix contaminants eluting off-line to waste. Eluent from the ISRP column containing the glucuronides was then transferred on-line to the β-glucuronidase column for deconjugation and passed directly on-line to the C8 column. In this portion of the chromatographic procedure, the mobile phase consisted of 0.01 M ammonium acetate at pH 6.7. The analyte concentrated on the top of the reversed-phase column was then eluted using a gradient mobile phase system of acetonitrile and 0.01 M ammonium acetate (pH 5.0) and detected at UV wavelength of 280 nm.

abstract={Echocardiographic image interpretation is predominantly a subjective process, generally performed using the 'eyeball' technique and thus critically dependent on the reviewer's experience. In the past, software packages for digital image analysis have been limited. Recently, Advanced Technology Laboratories (ATL) has introduced HDI Lab for the analysis of digital images from the A TL HDI 5000 CV ultrasound machine. The purpose of this study was to apply HDI Lab to characterize the normal patterns of echocardiographic contrast uptake into the myocardium. Only by understanding the spatial variation in contrast uptake with normal perfusion can this technique be applied to patients with coronary artery disease. Digital images were obtained from 7 normal volunteers pre and post injection of Optison, microbubbles of albumin containing perfluorocarbon gas. Apical 4 and 2 chamber images were obtained in pulse-inversion harmonic mode, gated to end-diastole of every fourth beat, and stored to either a 3.5″ magneto-optical disk (MOD) on the echo machine or to a remote PC via a network connection. Images were stored in a polar format containing data from individual scan lines and echo density quantified from regions of interest in the basal, mid and apical regions of the inferior, septal, anterior and lateral walls. Multifactorial analysis of variance demonstrated highly significant (p<0.001) increase in echogenicity of all walls indicating definite contrast presence in the myocardium. However, there was considerable variability in contrast effect with a strong (p<0.004) gradient from the base (least intense) to the apex (most intense), perhaps due to attenuation from overlying structures. Such heterogeneity of effect will have to be considered as contrast echocardiography is applied to patients with coronary artery disease.},

This literature is critically reviewed in the present study, which is in two parts. In this first part, the focus is on experimental methods. Two main recommendations emerge from this review. First, the pressure-sensitive film should be used. Second, more work is needed in many areas, an example of which is the effect of the method of sterilization of tibial inserts on the contact stress at the tibiofemoral interface in knee implants.},

The present study has investigated whether fatty acids directly influence peptide release from enteroendocrine cells using STC-1, a mouse intestinal endocrine tumour cell line, previously shown to release cholecystokinin (CCK) in response to other physiological stimuli. 2. Fatty acids elicited a chain length- and dose-dependent stimulation of CCK secretion. Dodecanoic acid (C12) was most effective, producing up to a 5-fold increase in CCK secretion. Fatty acids with less than ten carbon atoms did not increase secretion. The chain length dependence of these effects mimics closely fatty acid-induced CCK secretion previously observed in humans in vivo. 3. Esterification of C12 abolished CCK secretion, indicating a critical role for a free carboxyl group in eliciting secretion. In contrast, modification of the methyl terminus had no effect on C12-induced secretion. The non-metabolizable C12 analogue 2-bromododecanoic acid was equally effective. 4. C12 elicited a marked increase in intracellular calcium levels (200-300 nM) in STC-1 cells which was abolished by the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist nicardipine. In contrast, C8 produced a smaller and more transient Ca2+ response. C12-induced CCK secretion was also blocked by nicardipine. 5. These data suggest that fatty acids can interact directly with enteroendocrine cells to stimulate CCK secretion via increases in intracellular calcium mediated primarily by L-type Ca2+ channels.},

Acidification alone was demonstrated to be inadequate and resulted in a significant underestimation of dissolved Cu (losses ranging from 50% to &gt;90%). Similar losses were observed in both polyethylene and Teflon storage bottles. Experiments suggest that losses of copper occur following sample acidification owing to the formation of stable copper sulfide phases which adsorb onto container surfaces. It is therefore recommended that an oxidative pretreatment step is carried out prior to the acidification of porewaters collected for metal analysis. The results of this study suggest that much of the previous data reporting dissolved Cu concentrations in sulfidic waters and porewaters may be in error.},

A binary mobile phases was used: mobile phase A consisted of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.8)-methanol- dimethylacetamide (69:24:7, v/v) and mobile phase B consisted of sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.8)-methanol=dimethylacetamide (15:45:40, v/v). The flow- rate was maintained at 150 μl/min. For monoamines and metabolites we used a 150x1 mm I.D. C18 5 μm reversed-phase column. The mobile phase consisted of 25 mM monobasic sodium phosphate, 50 mM sodium citrate, 27 μM reversed- phase column.

The potential was +700 mV versus Ag/AgCI reference electrode for both the amino acids and the biogenic amines and metabolites. Ten rat brain regions, including various cortical areas, the cerebellum, hippocampus, substantia nigra, red nucleus and locus coeruleus were microdissected or micropunched from frozen 300-μm tissue slices. Tissue samples were homogenized in 50 or 100 μl of 0.05 M perchloric acid. The precise handling and processing of the tissue samples and tissue homogenates are described in detail, since care must be exercised in processing such small volumes while preventing sample degradation. An aliquot of the sample was derivatized to form that tert-butylthiol derivatives of the amino acids and γ-aminobutyric acid. A second aliquot of the same sample was used for monamine and metabolite analyses. The results indicate that the procedure is ideal for processing and analyzing small tissue samples.},

A genetic defect of enzymes involved in drug metabolism, particularly cytochrome P450 (CYP), has been believed to be one of the important causal factors of adverse drug reactions. There are multiple gene mutations for CYP causing the poor metabolizer phenotype. The occurrence of genetic polymorphism has been seen in genes for CYP1A1, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A5. Among them, the molecular mechanisms of genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 (debrisoquine/sparteine type) and CYP2A6 (coumarin type) in Japanese have been the focus of investigations. Only 20 - 30% of the Japanese population that shows the CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotype can be diagnosed by gene analysis. By other means, we found two new mutations, CYP2D6/J9 and CYP2D6/C8, in Japanese. With regard to CYP2A6, we discovered SM-12502, a new probe drug in addition to coumarin, that is currently under development; this drug is mainly metabolized by CYP2A6. Using this drug as a probe, we found poor metabolizers and analyzed the genes for CYP2A6. We found a new mutation (CYP2A6 whole deletion) responsible for the poor metabolizer phenotype. These results should contribute to the selection of an effective drug prescription and a reduced incidence of adverse effects.},

Large biases are likely when researchers omit experience or fail to correct for selection bias. Finally, there appears to be significant gender bias in gender research.

abstract={There has been substantial interest in the use of bilayer lipid membranes as the basis for development of biosensors, but limitations in the physical stability of such membranes have prevented practical applications. The reliability and reproducibility of surface-stabilized bilayer lipid membranes (sBLMs), that have been reported to spontaneously form on metallic electrodes, may offer an attractive approach to development of a practical method of device fabrication. An important question which has been raised about sBLMs is whether the membranes an actually of a thickness of a bilayer lipid membrane. The physical structure of sBLMs have been studied indirectly by electrochemical methods, and the results show some differences from those obtained from freely suspended planar BLMs. In this present work, we report direct ellipsometric studies of the thickness of lipid films that spontaneously thin on silver metal. Silver metal was vacuum deposited on polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) polymer. Such surfaces are analogous to metal wire which is encapsulated by Teflon, as is typically used in experiments for sBLM formation. Ellipsometry of surfaces was done using a closed solution cell that allowed for hydration of lipid films. Silver surfaces that were coated with dry phospholipid, and with phospholipid in hexane:ethanol solvent, both showed that spontaneous thinning of lipid films to monolayer, bilayer and trilayer thicknesses occurred in a few minutes. There was no dependence of membrane thickness or thinning rates on the diameter of the silver metal support over the range of 3.5 to 7.5 mm used in these studies. Immobilization of silver metal onto a chromium layer that was first applied to the PVDF was important in establishing increased speed of thinning and the physical stability of the system.},

No information is available, however, on the toxicological properties of 2,3,7,8-tetrafluorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TFDD). In our experiments, TFDD was found to act as a highly potent dioxin receptor agonist leading to a transient induction of cytochrome P450(CYP)1A1 mRNA and protein in receptor-proficient mouse Hepa-1 hepatoma cells treated with 10-10 M TFDD. However, no significant induction of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity was observable in TFDD-treated Hepa-1 cells or mouse hepatocytes in primary culture, suggesting an interference with the catalytic activity of CYP1A1. Parallel experiments with 10-10 M TCDD showed a sustained induction of CYP1A1 mRNA and protein, and of EROD activity. When a reporter gene construct comprising a xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE) in 5'-position was transfected in Hepa-1c-1c-7 cells, 5 x 10-8 M TFDD and 5 x 10-9 M TCDD induced transcription to a comparable extent. Both inducers were inactive when a mutant XRE with a guanine replaced by thymine was transfected. In metabolism studies in mouse liver homogenate, TFDD was rapidly degraded in the presence of an NADPH-regenerating system, and metabolism was enhanced in liver homogenate from β-naphthoflavone-pretreated mice indicating that TFDD is metabolized in a CYP-catalyzed pathway. The open ring products dihydroxytetrafluororbiphenyl ether, and 1,2-difluoro-o-benzoquinone, probably derived from 1,2-difluorocatechol, were identified by GC-MS analysis of the incubation mixtures, whereas no phenolic metabolites and/or metabolites with an intact dioxin ring could be found. It is concluded that TFDD, in contrast to its chlorinated analogue, is metabolically unstable, and thus currently does not fulfill the criteria for the recommendation of a TCDD or toxicity equivalency factor (TEF).},

In our center, from 1990 through 1995, 118 children and 5 adults with reflux and recurrent urinary tract infections were injected with cross-linked bovine collagen in an open, prospective study. Efficacy and safety were assessed 6 and 12 months after injection, and long-term (≤ 3 years) results were available in 78 cases. The overall success rate was 58% (64% of ureteral units) free from reflux at 12 months and 54% (58%) after 3 years. Analysis of anatomic, urodynamic, and technical features showed the grade of reflux to be the best predictor of success or failure. When only primary low- and middle-grade reflux, without concomitant anatomic disorders, is considered, the long-term success rate rose to 69% (74% of ureteral units). In conclusion, subureteric collagen injection cannot ultimately replace the highly effective surgical reimplantation. However, the procedure offers a minimally invasive alternative in selected cases of mild reflux when conservative management is inadequate.},

Selective functionalization of perfluoroaryl azides by versatile phosphorus hydrazide ligating systems 2 and 3 for the complexation of transition metals and analogous radiometals form the basis for these new agents. The utility of the photogenerated precursors from these bifunctional agents to form covalent attachments is demonstrated through examination of C-H bond insertion on cyclohexane. Representative amide-coupled phosphorus hydrazides 5 and 6 provide > 78% insertion of the probe into unactivated C-H bonds of cyclohexane with short photolysis times. Photoconjugation of the photoactivable heterobifunctional chelating agent 6 and its Pd metalated analog 7 with HSA is also evaluated. The uncomplexed chelate appears to add to HSA with high efficiency, consistent with the observed 82% bond insertion into model solvents. Covalent attachment of 7, evaluated through the use of Pd-109, was estimated to be between 49% and 74% with the uncertainty arising because of prephotolysis association of the Pd-109 complex with HSA. The application of in situ F-19 NMR to distinguish between bond insertion and noninsertion processes is demonstrated. These results suggest that functionalized perfluoroaryl azido phosphorus hydrazides may find utility as heterobifunctional photolabeling agents for attaching radionuclides to proteins and antibodies.},

abstract={Accurate mass analysis at high resolution can be used to determine elemental compositions and is often essential for conclusive metabolite identification. Reference standards can play an important role in the success of the analysis. We have discovered that perfluorinated acid anhydride/fluorinated alkylalcohol (PF-anh/F-alc) derivatives of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid are sensitively analysed by negative-ion electrospray ionization (ESI) and by positive-ion chemical ionization (CI). Based upon these results, PF-anh/F-alc derivatives of amino acids and PF-anh derivatives of primary amines were prepared, greatly expanding our collection of reference standards for accurate mass measurements. Sample ions are not suppressed since the reference standards can be selected based upon a narrow mass range of interest. They are volatile and, due to the degree of fluorination, have accurate masses favourably dose to nominal mass. They are adequately soluble in reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography solvents, making them particularly useful for ESI. Several examples of positive-ion CI and negative-ion electrospray MS accurate mass analyses of metabolites, obtained using the PF-anh/F-alc derivatives, are described.},

The outcome of the study indicated that the overall condition of the reactor is good and that it is being operated safely. The study also produced recommendations as to where safety can be improved. These recommendations are the basis of the upgrade program currently being implemented in the reactor. The Second Trip System (STS) is part of the upgrade program. It is a stand alone seismically qualified trip system that operates independently from the existing first trip system (FTS) to shutdown the reactor. This paper discusses the design, installation and the inactive commissioning of the system, and the process used to ensure that the system can be retrofitted to the reactor without affecting its safety or its operational requirements.},

Some important device applications for polyurethanes include peripheral and central venous catheters, pacemaker lead insulation, etc. Ether-based polyurethanes have been shown to be stable in vitro for many years, and yet when implanted undergo rapid microcracking. Microcracks not only weaken the polymer, but serve as nucleation sites for thrombus formation, and may eventually lead to catastrophic failure. In this communication we report on a new family of polycarbonate-based polyurethanes. Our data suggests that polycarbonate-based polyurethanes may have overcome the microcracking problems associated with the use of ether-based polyurethanes.},

It presents a method of dynamic extraction that measures the rate at which inorganic contaminants are extracted from components as a function of time. The method overcomes many of the shortcomings of conventional techniques. It allows prediction of the amount of contamination added to chemical in a process tool with time. Examples of its use to measure extraction from all-Teflon 0.05-μm microporous membrane filters in 49 percent HF are included. Extraction from five different types of filters was measured. Each filter was tested for 2 to 8 weeks with multiple samples taken during the course of the extraction for metal analysis. Filters of the same type had similar extraction rates and similar contaminant "fingerprints." There were large differences between filter types. The use of an inappropriate O-ring on a filter cartridge was identified. The decrease in the rate of extraction from the filters was similar to theoretical predictions.},

In the present study. the residues of microsomal assays were extracted with organic solvents to determine the metabolites of the studied compounds with GC-ECD and GC-MS. Extracts of microsomal assays contained a matrix which interferes with these type of measurements. The matrix was hard to remove completely with solid phase adsorption chromatography. To overcome the problem of the interfering compounds, clean-up properties of a gel permeation chromatography system were studied for this specific matrix. The clean-up was firstly studied with model compounds and two different mobile phases. Thereupon the most appropriate mobile phase was applied to the extracts of a microsomal assay. Acetone and cyclohexane-dichloromethane (CH-DCM, 1:1, v/v) were compared as mobile phases. The elution profiles of several lipids and some organohalogen compounds (OHCs) were determined. The mixture CH-DCM yielded the best separation between lipids and the OHCs. The results were discussed with a theoretical evaluation on the basis of interactions between solute, solvent and stationary phase. Recoveries were assessed for the GPC procedure and appeared to be good (98-100% for the column itself and 80-100% for the sample transfer from vial to column). The GPC was integrated in the clean-up of the extract of a microsomal PCDF metabolism assay yielding satisfactory results.},

The amount of HF used was approximately twice the stoichiometric requirement for 33% silicon contained in the samples, assuming all silicon exists as silica. The amount of boric acid used was the stoichiometric requirement for the HF added. With a sample dilution factor of 2000 (v/m), the end solution contained less than or equal to 0.17% total dissolved solids for ICP-MS analysis. The ICP-MS system was calibrated by the method of external standards prepared in reagent blank solutions with In as the internal standard. The sensitivity of the In signal in a 5-8 h operation was only decreased by 5-10%. Background interferences from the digestion reagents were studied and corrected. The method developed is simple and rugged and suitable for routine analysis of at least 25 elements: Al, Ag, As, Ba, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, Sr, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V and Zn. The recoveries for most of these elements in standard reference materials including coal fly ash, urban particulate matter, sediment and soil were within 90-110%, and the relative standard deviations were within 5%.

abstract={The cytochrome P450 catalysed biotransformation of 4-halogenated anilines was studied in vitro with special emphasis on the dehalogenation to 4-aminophenol metabolites. The results demonstrated that a fluorine substituent at the C4 position was more easily eliminated from the aromatic ring than a chloro-, bromo- or iodo-substituent. HPLC analysis of in vitro biotransformation patterns revealed that the dehalogenation of the C4-position was accompanied by formation of non-halogenated 4-aminophenol, without formation of NIH-shifted metabolites. Changes in the apparent Vmaxfor the microsomal oxidative dehalogenation appeared to correlate with the electronegativity of the halogen substituent at C4, the fluorine substituent being the one most easily eliminated. A similar decrease in the rate of dehalogenation from a fluoro- to a chloro- to a bromo- to an iodo-substituent was observed in a system with purified reconstituted cytochrome P450 IIB1, in a tertiair butyl hydroperoxide supported microsomal cytochrome P450 system as well as in a system with microperoxidase 8. This microperoxidase 8 is a haem-based mini-enzyme without a substrate binding site, capable of catalysing cytochrome P450-like reaction chemistry. Together, these results excluded the possibility that the difference in the rate of dehalogenation with a varying C4-halogen substituent arose from a change in the contribution of cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in oxidative dehalogenation with a change in the halogen substituent. Rather, they strongly suggested that the difference was indeed due to an intrinsic electronic parameter of the various C4 halogenated anilines dependent on the type of halogen substituent. Additional in vitro experiments with polyfluorinated anilines demonstrated that elimination of the C4-fluorine substituent became more difficult upon the introduction of additional electron withdrawing fluorine substituents in the aniline-ring. 19F-NMR analysis of the metabolite patterns showed that the observed decrease in 4-aminophenol formation was accompanied by a metabolic switch to 2-aminophenols and N-hydroxyanilines, while products resulting from NIH-type mechanisms were not observed. For a C4chloro-, bromo-, or iodo-substituted 2-fluoroaniline the Vmax for the oxidative dehalogenation was reduced by the additional electron withdrawing fluorine substituent at the C2 position in a similar way. In conclusion, the results of the present study strongly indicate that the possibilities for cytochrome P450 mediated dehalogenation of 4-halogenated anilines to 4-aminophenol metabolites are dependent on: (i) the characteristics of the halogen that has to be eliminated, the most electronegative and smallest halogen being the one most easily eliminated, and (ii) the electron-withdrawing capacities of other substituents in the aromatic ring, electron-withdrawing substituents decreasing the relative rate of the reaction. Together these data lead to the conclusion that the halogen is eliminated as a halogen anion. © 1995.},

Over the past 50 years, several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the observed regioselective metallation. For the first time, the reaction of perfluoroalkylphenyl sulfides with organolithium reagents has been investigated and found to furnish products resulting from the replacement of the perfluoroalkyl moieties with alkyl groups derived from the metallating agents. Phenyltrifluoromethyl ether, the anisole analog, failed to undergo metallation. A rationalization for the formation of unusual products via mediation of a single-electron-transfer process is presented in this paper together with the spectral data of the products. © 1995.},

Biodistribution of [123I]β-CIT-FE and [123I]β-CIT-FP measured by whole body conjugate imaging demonstrated major uptake in the brain, liver, and GI tract, with excretion occurring through both the renal and hepatobiliary routes. Absorbed radiation dose estimates based on the MIRD schema indicated highest dose rates to the urinary bladder wall and lower large intestine wall (0.7 and 0.6 rad/mCi for [123I]β-CTT-FE and 0.7 and 0.9 rad/mCi for [123I]β-CIT-FP, respectively). The high uptake in the striatum and the relative specificity with respect to cortical, midbrain, and cerebellar areas, suggest that [123I](β-CIT-FE and [123I]β-CIT-FP may be valuable tracers for studying the dopamine system in vivo by tomographic imaging. © 1995 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract={New recently implemented techniques and sample strategies for the determination of trace metals in seawater are discussed. It is shown that only with the highest precautions to prevent contamination, reliable results can be obtained. These precautions start already with the preparation of the sample bottles and sampling equipment in the laboratory. A rubber boat, Go-Flo samplers and a specially designed teflon-coated winch with Kevlar rope is used to collect the samples. At sea, the prevention of contamination of the samples is the highest priority. This implicates the use of a clean air van or at least a laminary flow bench. Acids have to be subboiling distilled in a quartz still and stored in teflon bottles. Preconcentration of the samples on board or in the home laboratory has to be done in clean rooms. This paper gives an account of current procedures used for sampling and analysing seawater for trace metal determinations. © 1994 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association)},

Infusions of oxygenated perfluorochemicals during brief coronary occlusions, as occurs with angioplasties, preserves cardiac ultrastructure and cardiac function. Fluosol is currently approved in the U.S. for angioplasty procedures. Experimental studies have suggested that perfluorochemicals reduce myocardial infarct size during permanent coronary occlusion or temporary coronary occlusion. One school of thought suggests that these agents work by reducing reperfusion injury. By inhibiting neutrophil function, including adherence to endothelial cells and release of toxic substances, perfluorochemicals may preserve the endothelium and prevent no-reflow. However, one might argue that any agent which reduces infarct size by any mechanism would result in less neutrophil infiltration and smaller no-reflow areas. One pilot study suggested that intracoronary Fluosol administered at the time of reperfusion, reduced infarct size and improved regional ventricular function in patients. However, preliminary results of a large multicenter study in which this agent was given along with thrombolysis, were largely negative.Whether perfluorochemicals will become an important adjunctive agent along with reperfusion for acute myocardial infarction remains to be determined. © 1994, Informa UK Ltd.

abstract={The complement system is an important branch of the innate immune response, constituting a first line of defence against invading microorganisms which activate complement via both antibody-dependent and-independent mechanisms. Activation of complement leads to (a) a direct attack upon the activating cell surface by assembly of the pore-forming membrane attack complex (MAC), and (b) the generation of inflammatory mediators which target and recruit other branches of the immune system. However, uncontrolled complement activation can lead to widespread tissue damage in the host, since certain of the activation products, notably the fragment C3b and the C5b-7 complex, can bind nonspecifically to any nearby cell membranes. Therefore it is important that complement activation is tightly regulated. Our own cells express a number of membrane-bound control proteins which limit complement activation at the cell surface and prevent accidental complement-mediated damage. These include decay-accelerating factor, complement receptor 1 and membrane cofactor protein, all of which are active at the level of C3/C5 convertase formation. Until recently, cell surface control of MAC assembly had been attributed to a single 65-kD membrane protein called homologous restriction factor (alternatively named C8-binding protein and MAC-inhibiting protein). However a second MAC-inhibiting protein has since been discovered and it is now clear that this protein plays a major role in the control of membrane attack. This review charts the rapid progress made in elucidating the protein and gene structure, and the mechanism of action of this most recently discovered complement inhibitor, CD59. © 1993 Humana Press Inc.},

abstract={The periodic analytical control of waste landfill leachate is of fundamental importance not only to check the presence of possible toxic substances, but also to assess changes in concentration levels and behaviour with time. This work identifies some of the difficulties which arise during the analysis of some heavy metals and trace elements in leachate samples from a controlled industrial wastes landfill located in north Italy. The analytical problems encountered using both electro-thermal atomic absorption spectroscopy (ETAAS) and neutron activation analysis (NAA) for the determination of a series of elements, Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni, Mn, V, As, Se, Sb, Th, Sn, Cs, W, Cr, with concentration often at nanogram levels, are presented and evaluated. To solve these problems two selective chemical procedures have been developed to separate and to eliminate the matrix interfering compounds or elements (i.e., organic matter, complexing agents, Cl-, Br-, S2-, Na+) which reduce and in some cases impair the sensitivity of the technique. For the analyses by ETAAS a preliminary preconcentration and separation procedure, based on the ion exchange resin Chelex-100 has been developed to determine Pb, Cd, Co, Cu, Ni and Sn. In the case of NAA a specific radiochemical separation had to be studied for the analysis of Sn, V, W, Mn, Cr, As, Sb, Se, Th in presence of high bromine and sodium concentrations. Procedures blanks and yields have been controlled and evaluated and quality assurance measurements have been carried out analyzing, with the proposed methods, standard reference materials from BCR and NIST. Furthermore, different mineralization procedures using both microwave and Teflon bomb have been compared and evaluated. © 1993.},

Metals such as Fe and Cu are strongly adhered, and they can be removed to some extent by SPM or FPM cleaning. The surface metallic concentration of PFA sheets did not increase when they were dipped into UPW or chemicals contaminated with metals, therefore it is assumed that metallic impurities do not adhere to the PFA surface from liquids. Moreover the metallic transfer tests showed that a cleaned PFA sheet did not contaminate Si wafers but an uncleaned sheet polluted the wafer strongly with metallic impurities. Therefore, when PFA molded parts such as wafer carriers and tubes are used in wet processing in semiconductor manufacturing, they must be cleaned by SPM or FPM cleaning. © 1993, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

This method can be applied to the determination of metal ions such as Pb, Ni, Cd, Fe and Cu. The linear dynamic range is larger than two orders of magnitude, the detection limit is at the ng ml-1 level and the R.S.D. is ca. 3% at mid-calibration range.

abstract={The Internal Surface Reversed Phase (ISRP)–an elegant invention of Dr. Thomas C. Pinkerton–was the first example of a Restricted Access Medium (RAM). These materials allow the determination of small molecules in the presence of large biomolecules, for instance the direct injection of serum into an HPLC column without requiring prior removal of protein. A new RAM is the SemiPermeable Surface (SPS), based on the doctoral research of Carla Desilets under Dr. Fred Regnier at Purdue University, developed to its present form at the Regis Chemical Company. The SPS has two phases: an outer and an inner, each independently synthesized, each covalently bound to the silica surface of the packing particle. The outer is a hydrophilic polyoxyethylene polymer; the inner is any of several common hydrophobic reversed phases (at present, C8, C18, nitrile, phenyl). The outer phase forms a semipermeable surface that prevents large biopolymers from reaching the inner phase. Small molecules, however, can and do interact with either the outer or the inner phase. They are retained by a unique mechanism–a combination of hydrogen bonding at the outer polyoxyethylene surface and hydrophobic interaction at the inner reversed phase. Aside from its experimentally variable selectivity-a completely new property-SPS also shows excellent chromatographic efficiency and roughly twice the retentivity of comparable RAM materials. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Inert (glass/TefIon) vessels were used for the exposure tests. A.C. impedance equipment was used for the electrochemical tests. The more useful data were obtained from the imersion tests. In these, "blanks" (no test specimens) were Included to provide baseline data. The S/V (Surface-of-metal-to- Volume-of-liquid) ratios employed are stipulated. All tests were carried out at 90°F (32°C). Tests of three different durations, 44, 90 and 180 days, ware conducted for each MON-3/Metal combination. Data for 0 days exposure were obtained fros test specimen “blanks” (no MON-3 exposure). The parameters defined reasonable values for S/V, temperature and time in terms of the intended application, communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit for minimum of seven years. In all cases, precisely the same techniques were employed by the same anatyst, for the pre and post test analyses.Construction of the test vessels, by design, was such as to allow prefiltration of propellant post test to a degree used In commercial production, 10-40 microns. This allowed separation of propellant from metal for analyses of effects on the metal by contact with the propellant, and vice versa. The propellant was filtered through stack of three, tared Teflon membranes. The top membrane had a pore tile rating of 5 microns. The underlying membrane pore sizes were in the colloid size range of 0.2 micron. Weight changes of the separate membranes provided data concerning the size of particles generated during test and the presence of colloids. Optical microscopic analyses, at x4G, of the particles retained by the 5 micron membrane, coupled with files of “knowns” and supplemented with analyses of particles of questionable composition, allowed identification of specific corrosion products and their likely source. Atomic absorption analyses of filtrates allowed monitoring of corrosion of given element from a given alloy, as a function of time. In search of accelerating, galvanic effects.Test specimens were subjected, systematically, to metallurgical and electron spectroscopy analyses. Optical microscopy, supported principally by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), was utilised in a study of surfaces for the presence of grain structure, intergranuler attack, pits, stress corrosion cracking, overlying films and their behaviour upon exposure to MON-3, as a function of time. Extensive electron spectroscopy analyses were performed utilising XPS (X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy), alternatively referred to as ESCA (Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy). XPS, was used to elucidate the elemental composition but also the “chemistry” of the surface, I.e., the combinations (compounds) in which the elements existed. AES allowed a cross-check on the elemental composition of a metal surface end provided additional information when repeated after subjecting the surface to IBM (Ion Beam Milling). Subsequent AES analyses provided data concerning the underlying layers. Repetition of the IBM/AES cycle, until base metal composition was reached, allowed deduction of the history of processing steps to which the specimens had been exposed, identification of surface films and their thickness. Taken together, the analyses demonstrated that the materials selected for the INTELSAT VII Propulsion System were satisfactory for the mission intended. © 1992 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. lnc.

Exposure to most hardware materials did not significantly affect the concentration of four metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb) but there was significant loss (up to 79%) of two organic compounds (fluoranthene, p,p′-DDE) to almost all the hardware materials tested. Of five commonly used IW collection methods (centrifuging, centrifugal drainage or basal cup, squeezing, vacuum filtration and dialysis) investigated, the centrifuge method was judged the most accurate and precise for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and PCBs. All IW collection methods tested showed high variability for the metals. As a result, with one exception (Cu), there was no significant difference detected in the accuracy of the methods for metals. © 1992.},

abstract={An electroanalytical device is described that is suitable for trace metal analysis by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) in highly‐resistive media in the absence of supporting electrolytes. It consists of a thin mercury film electrodeposited at the glassy carbon‐ion‐exchange membrane interface obtained by clamping a glassy carbon ring to one surface of a perfluorinated ion‐exchange membrane (cationic, Nafion 117, or anionic, Tosflex IE SA48). The inner surface of the membrane is in contact with an electrolyte solution (0.01 M HClO4), containing the counter and reference electrodes. The ion‐exchange membrane replaces a conventional supporting electrolyte dissolved in the analyte sample and can be regarded as a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) confined to the near neighborhood of the working electrode. This device has been used to perform differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetric (DPASV) analyses of electrolyte‐free aqueous synthetic samples containing copper and lead ions. Better results are found at glassy carbon‐supported mercury electrodes facing anionic Tosflex membranes, since similar devices assembled with cationic Nafion membranes experience a memory effect associated with blockage of metal ions, due to cation‐exchange processes that occur during the stripping redissolution step, even though these processes are able, at the same time, to lead to an increase of DPASV peaks due to metal ion accumulation near the electrode surface. Approximate detection limits of 3.5 × 10−10 M (0.02 ppb) for Cu2+ and 3 × 10−10 M (0.05 ppb) for Pb2+ are estimated at Tosflex‐equipped devices for a signal‐to‐noise ratio of 3. Possible modifications aimed at improving the performance of such a device are discussed. Copyright © 1991 VCH Publishers, Inc.},

S‐(+)‐(5‐2H3)hexobarbital and R‐(−)‐(5‐2H3)hexobarbital were synthesized for clinical studies along with (±)‐(1,5‐2H6)hexobarbital and the deuterated major metabolites for use as internal and reference standards. Hexobarbital enantiomers and their metabolites were analyzed after pentafluorobenzyl and trimethylsilyl derivatization, following solid‐phase extraction from plasma and urine. Intense negative ion spectra were observed for all of the derivatives. The base peak in the spectra corresponded to the M ‐ penta‐fluorobenzyl anion [M  PFB]− except for 1,5‐dimethylbarbituric acid, where M−· was the most abundant ion. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by following the plasma concentration‐time profiles and urinary excretion in a male extensive metabolizer of mephenytoin who was given a pseudoracemic oral dose of hexobarbital containing equal 50 mg amounts of S‐(+)‐2(H0)hexobarbital and R‐(−)‐(2H3)hexobarbital. Marked stereoselective disposition was observed, with the R‐(−)‐enantiomer being more efficiently metabolized, primarily by alicyclic oxidation and ring cleavage.

abstract={The literature on the issue of whether heparin is necessary in an intermittent peripheral venous access device (lock) is critically reviewed. Issues explored include loss of patency, development of phlebitis, duration of lock placement, type of cannula material, sample size, risk of toxicity with heparin flush solutions, risk of clot embolism, and physical or chemical incompatibilities. Available studies indicate that heparin is not necessary to maintain fluoroethylenepropylene (FEP-Teflon) peripheral venous access devices unless the lock is used to obtain blood specimens. Considering the benefit-to-risk ratio for the use of heparin, it is advisable to maintain FEP-Teflon locks with normal saline alone. When locks are used to obtain blood specimens, as in a pharmacokinetic study, then a dilute heparin flush solution should be used. Whether heparin is necessary for the maintenance of locks composed of other materials is uncertain. Newer, less thrombogenic materials such as ethylene tetrafluoroethylene may also obviate the need for heparin, but comparative trials in a larger number of patients are needed for confirmation. When heparin is used, an effort should be made to avoid systemic toxicities by using the lowest known effective concentration (10 units/mL) pending further studies. © 1991, SAGE Publications.

abstract={A highly selective method for the determination of cobalt with a chemically modified carbon paste electrode Is proposed. It Is based on the chemical reactivity of an Immobilized modifier, 2,2-bipyrldyl, toward cobaH(II) Ion to yield the corresponding cation complex ((Bpy)3Co)2+, which Is taken up by another modifier, perfluorinated sulfonated polymer (Nation). Differential pulse voltammetry Is employed, and the oxidation of the complex, at +0.1 V vs SCE, Is observed. For a 5-mln preconcentration period, a linear calibration curve Is obtained for cobalt concentrations ranging from 7 × 10-7 to 1 × 10-5 mol/L, and the detection limit Is 3 × 10-7 mol/L. A lower detection limit can be obtained for longer preconcentration times. For eight preconcentratlon/determlnation/renewal cycles, the differential pulse voltammetric response could be reproduced with 4.3% relative standard deviation. Rapid and convenient acid renewal allows the use of an individual modified electrode surface In multiple analytical quantitations. Many coexisting metal Ions have little or no effect on the determination of cobalt. The procedure was applied to the determination of cobalt for four standard reference materials with relative standard deviation of 4.0-5.2%. © 1991, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Human exposure to carcinogenic aromatic amines can occur from a variety of sources, including cigarette smoke and cooked foods. Initial metabolism occurs primarily in the liver and involves N-hydroxylation by cytochrome P-450IA2 and N-acetylation by acetyltransferase, which serve as competing activation and detoxification reactions, respectively. Both enzymes are polymorphic in humans and individual phenotype can be readily assessed using caffeine ingested in coffee followed by urinary metabolite analysis. N-hydroxy arylamines can then be transported through the blood where they can form protein adducts with hemoglobin or undergo renal filtration into the urinary bladder lumen where, at acidic pH, they can react covalently with urothelial DNA. Carcinogen-DNA adduct levels in human bladder are smoking-related and the C8-deoxyguanosine derivative of 4-amino-biphenyl (ABP) is a major product. Alternatively, N-hydroxy arylamines can be conjugated in the liver by glucuronyl transferases which provides a mechanism for biliary transport to the colon lumen where beta-glucuronidases can regenerate the aglycone. In the colon mucosa, acetyltransferases can further activate the N-hydroxy metabolite by O-acetylation; and persons with the rapid acetylation phenotype are known to be at higher risk for colorectal cancer. Detection of specific arylamine-DNA adducts in human colon should provide direct evidence for the role of these carcinogens in the etiology of this disease.},

abstract={Unsaturated C8 and C11 hydrocarbons act as chemical signals (chemotaxis) during sexual reproduction of many marine brown algae. One of these compounds, namely (+)‐(6S)‐6‐(1Z‐butenyl)cyclohepta‐1,4‐diene (=ectocarpene) is also formed as a major hydrocarbon by the flowering plant Senecio isatideus (Asteraceae). On administration of enantiospecifically labelled (8R)‐ or (8S)‐[7,8‐2H2]trideca‐3,6,9‐trienoic acid instead of the natural precursor dodeca‐3,6,9‐trienoic acid to this plant, the artificial C12 analogue of ectocarpene is formed. Mass spectroscopic analysis of the metabolites revealed this process to be enantiospecific for the C(8)‐HRe atom of the precursor acid. The stereochemical course of the overall reaction is in agreement with a precise, U‐shaped embedding of the trienoic acid into the active center of the enzyme(s) and Re‐attack onto a hydrogen at the C(8) methylene group of this precursor. The reactive intermediate cyclizes by π‐orbital interaction between C(4) and C(6) of the acid and is accompanied by decarboxylation. The first product is a thermally unstable (S,2R)‐cis‐1‐(1E3Z‐hexadienyl)‐2‐vinylcyclopropane, which immediately rearranges to (+)‐(6S)‐ectocarpene (homo‐Cope rearrangement). The present work provides first experimental evidence for a homo‐Cope rearrangement as a naturally occurring electrocyclic reaction. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract={Thymulin (formerly called FTS) is a well-defined nonapeptide hormone produced by thymic epithelial cells. Its biological activity and antigenicity depend on the presence of the metal zinc in the molecule. The interaction between this metal ion and thymulin has been investigated by means of one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments. These experiments were performed in dimethyl-d6 sulfoxide solution and in aqueous medium with different metal: peptide ratios. The results are compared with those obtained for complexes of thymulin with other metal ions (Cu2+ and Al3+) and for the [Ala4]- and [Ala8]-analogs in terms of biological activity. These comparative studies suggest that the 1:1 complex is the only conformation recognized by the antibodies. From the NOESY data, a spatial conformation has been proposed for this complex. This conformation should be the physiological one and could lead to a better insight into the conformation requirements at receptor sites. © 1990 Humana Press Inc.},

The first test runs with the pressurized gasifier were carried out in summer 1988. The gasifier was operated at pressures of up to 10 bar and the maximum thermal input with peat was 400 kW. Air and steam were used as gasification agents. During 175 hours of operation 11 tons of peat was successfully gasified. The effect of operating conditions on gas composition, tar formation and fines elutriation was investigated. Carbon conversion without cyclone dust recycle was 75-85% and the calorific value of the gas (LHV) ranged 4-4.5 MJ/Nm3. Alkali metals release in fluidized-bed gasification of peat was investigated experimentally and theoretically. Samples were taken from various points and analyzed for the alkali metal content.

abstract={In this paper the properties of water and of large organic ions or neutral molecules confined within the perfluorinated membrane Nafion are studied by electron spin resonance of nitroxide probes. The membrane was used in conditions of full hydration and after exchange with mono- and di-positive ions. The analysis was mainly based on the ESR lineshapes and the correlation times for the motion of positive, neutral, and negative radicals. The dependence of the lineshape on the charge of the probe and on the charge of metal ions was analyzed as a function of temperature. The behavior of adsorbed water was similar to that observed in other systems in which the liquid was finely dispersed. The decreased polarity of sorbed water as a consequence of the lower strength of the hydrogen bond, suggested by A. Falk (Canad. J. Chem. 58, 1495 (1980)) was confirmed from the AN values of nitroxides. These were located in ionic clusters and were exposed to the interactions with pendant fluorocarbon chains. The extent of these interactions depended on the charge of either the nitroxides or the exchanged metal ion. The ESR patterns invariantly arose from the superposition of many absorptions due to radicals showing different motional rates and in slow exchange among different sites. This indicated the presence of ionic clusters of variable sizes in which water moved with different diffusion coefficients. The comparison between the ESR results and the previously reported NMR results confirmed the nonuniformities in the membrane structure. © 1989.},

A strong solvent influence is observed. The dependence of the direction of the reactions, either as a trifluoromethylation or a fluorination, is discussed. In the presence of CH3CN a ligand-exchange reaction is observed, yielding trifluoromethyl iron acetonitrile complexes, while carbonyl complexes are obtained in ethers. The compound [Fe(CO)4(CF3)2] has been prepared in 65% yield, and its 19F n.m.r., i.r., Raman, mass, and Mössbauer spectra recorded. The advantage of observing the 13C satellites in the 19F n.m.r. spectra for the analysis of trifluoromethyl metal compounds is established. If the appropriate reaction conditions are used, Cd(CF3)2 complexes react as fluorination reagents and CF2 sources. Thus, on reaction of the trifluoromethyl cadmium reagents with tetracarbonyliron halides in CH3CN, diamagnetic fluoroiron acetonitrile complexes are formed.},

abstract={The salient physicochemical properties of the fluorocarbons are briefly reviewed, including their solubility for the physiologically important gases and their properties relevant to formulation (nonmiscibility with water). The preparations used to data are described, including their properties and compositions, with some comment about the available knowledge of the properties of the constituents. A critical review of the biological aspects and the possible uses of fluorocarbon emulsions constitutes the main body of the manuscript. Gas-transporting capabilities are considered quantitatively. The biological effects of these preparations are reviewed in in vivo, whole body systems, with some in vitro evidence where appropriate. The usefulness of these preparations investigated to date are reviewed under the broad headings of cardiovascular system, radiology, intoxications, and organ preservation. Finally, the shortcomings and potential usefulness are discussed, with recommendations for potential modifications. © 1987.},

The perfluoro analogues of the 'metallic' (C10H8)2+ salt do not exist. The π electrons of the fluorine ligands of the perfluoro aromatics are responsible for the failure of these species to make metallic stacks. Attempts to prepare C6H6+ salts have given the para phenylene cation salts (C6H4)n+MF6- which are good electronic conductors. Electron oxidation of perhydropoly-nuclear aromatics by C6F6+ salts or by AsF5 e.g. 3AsF5 + 2C24H12 → 2C24H12+AsF6- + AsF3, yields what appear to be salts of the polynuclear aromatic cations. The magnetic and electrical properties of such salts will be described.},

This study developed a spectral method of analyzing 12Kh18N10T steel for Ni, Cr, Mn, and Si with a relative standard deviation of 0. 02-0. 05. The samples weighed less than equivalent to 0. 3 g and contained, in %: 14-24 Cr, 5-14 Ni, 0. 5-3. 0 Mn, and 0. 4-1. 2 Si. The method was based on dissolving the sample followed by spectral emission through excitation with a unipolar, high-voltage spark. The test solution was placed in a 4-ml Teflon cuvette fitted with a titanium electrode holder.},

abstract={A method for microanalysis of single crystals of metal-borides grown by aluminum flux method was developed by using ICP-AES. Selected single crystals (1 to 5 mg) were dissolved with a mixture of 1 ml nitric acid (1+1) and 0.05 ml sulfuric acid (1+1) in a Teflon-lined bomb by heating at 150°C for 3 h. Some borides (e.g. i-, Cr-, Nb- and Ta-borides) were found to be insoluble or partly soluble in the mixture. For complete dissolution of the borides, an addition of 0.2 ml hydrofluoric acid (1+1) was necessary. Tests for recovery of pure crystalline boron showed that the leakage of boron from the bomb was negligible in the presence of hydrofluoric acid. When the sample solutions containing the acid were sprayed into the ICP through a borosilicate glass sample introduction system (a nebulizer and a spray chamber), the background intensity of boron increased and seriously interfered the determination of the element. The difficulty was overcome by the use of a quartz or a commercial Teflon sample introduction system, the former system being superior to the latter both in simplicity of construction and in repeatability of measurements. Owing to the lack of certified and homogeneous standards, it was difficult to determine precision and accuracy of the method. But tentative standard deviations of boron/metal atomic ratio were obtained for TiB2 and ZrB2 as follows: B/Ti=1.92±0.04, B/Zr=1.99±0.044. © 1986, The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry.

abstract={Theoretical and practical hints for the detection of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb und Zn) in bird eggs and feathers with the help of AAS (Flame and Grapite-Furnace), are given. Before starting the metal analysis with AAS, great errors are possible, especially when preparing and digesting the samples. Therefore great care and accuracy is necessary. In order to keep digestion system free of contamination, tightly closed quartzglass flasks and acid digestion bombs (Teflon) must be used. Addition of slight quantities of acids are recommended as well. The concentration of Fe and Zn in the matrices are high enough being determined by the flame atomic absorption. If the concentrations of Cd, Cu and Pb are high enough, they can be determined with this technique as well. However, they are normally analysed by means of the rather complicated flameless operation (Graphite-Tube). The sample solution cannot be measured directly in the graphite cuvette, since chemical and physical interferences do arise. Many matrix effects can be eliminated by using a proper dilution with double dest. water. If the results obtained are not reproducible the "addition method" must be used. The difficulties of trace element analysis (Cd, Cu and Pb) in eggshells is especially mentioned, and a procedure of extraction with methyl isobutyl ketone/ammonium pyrollidine dithiocarbamate (MIBK/APDC) is indicated. © 1986 Verlag der Deutschen Ornithologen-Gesellschaft.},

abstract={Simultaneous multielement analysis of certified reference material “Hair”, which was issued from the National Institute for Environmental Studies, has been investigated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (IGP-AES). The hair sample was dried at 85 °G for 4 h, and cooled for 30 min in a desiccator. The sample (ca. 250 mg) was digested with HNO3-HF-HCIO4 or ashed at 450-600 °C. The acid digestion was performed in a sealed Teflon vessel at 140 °C for 4 h. The ashed sample was treated with HGl and HF to dissolve the sample. The digested or ashed sample was finally diluted to 25 ml. The spectral interference and analytical figures of merit were examined to evaluate the analytical feasibilities of IGP-AES for hair analysis. Trace metals (Al, As, Ba, Ga, Gr, Gu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Sr, Ti, and Zn) were detected in the hair sample, and the analytical results were compared with the reported values. The measured values for most elements were reasonable, although the concentrations of Ca, Al, Fe, and Ti were very high probably because of the contamination in the preparation procedure of the certified ard reference material. © 1985, The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry.

The procedure utilizes the ion‐pairing reagent, bis(2‐ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid, which frees the amines from most contaminants and permits the efficient extraction of the amphoteric compounds (as acetates) from the aqueous solution. Amines I and III and acetylated amines II and IV were perfluoro‐acetylated prior to GC‐EC analysis. Metabolism of I, II, and III in the rat brain was studied. Results indicate that both in vivo and in vitro amines I and III are p‐hydroxylated to II and IV, respectively, and II is β‐hydroxylated to give IV.

The N6- and C8-substituted analogs of cyclic AMP (10-100 μM) were not cleared as rapidly as exogenous cyclic AMP and were metabolized: N6- and C8-substituted analogs of adenosine accumulated in perfusate and urine. All analogs exhibited net transtubular secretion, i.e. their urinary excretion rate > glomerular filtration rate. Probenecid (0.9 mM) included in the perfusate abolished transtubular secretion and inhibited the metabolism of PCPT-cyclic AMP, suggesting that cyclic AMP analogs, like cyclic AMP itself, penetrate the renal cell at the peritubular membrane by an organic acid transport system. The phosphorothioate diastereomers of cyclic AMP: cAMPS(Sp) and cAMPS(Rp) were cleared as rapidly from the perfusate as cyclic AMP, were extensively secreted (urinary excretion/ glomerular filtration ≧100) and exhibited no metabolism. The latter analog would seem most suitable as an intracellular agonist for cyclic AMP-mediated phenomena in the rat kidney. © 1983.},

abstract={A comparative analysis of smooth-surfaced synthetic materials, gels, especially those based on polyacrylamide, and polyester flocked surfaces indicate profound differences between these three types of materials when in contact with blood. Although many smooth-surfaced materials adsorb fibrinogen in vitro, several of these perform well in vivo without polymerization of fibrinogen to fibrin leading to clot-formation apparently because of enzymatic reactions in the physiological environment. Polyacrylamide hydrogels adsorb little plasma proteins, show negligible platelet adhesion and activation. In contrast, polyester flocked (fibril) surfaces deposit large quantities of fibrinogen that polymerize to fibrin with entrapped formed blood elements (clot). The thickness of this layer is difficult to control and the build-up continues to a thickness up to approximately 400 to 600 μm depending on the species. The danger of clot-fragmentation and flock-detachment especially during flexing makes these rough surfaces inferior in blood-contacting applications, in comparison to the best current synthetic smooth-surfaced biomaterials, hydrogels, and chemically modified natural tissue components.},

In control series hydroxyethyl starch (HES) instead of fluorocarbon was used. Improving O2 supply in FC 43 experiments raised Na reabsorption to 149 μmol/g x min compared to 84.1 μmol/g x min in HES experiments. In the presence of PAH, however, Na reabsorption in FC 43 experiments was only 115 μmol/g x min. In both series, perfusion flow, calculated on the basis of C(PAH), remained below the directly measured flow rate, unless analysis included all metabolites of PAH. N-acetylated metabolites of PAH were released at a 5 times higher rate by kidneys perfused with FC 43 than by HES-perfused organs. These results demonstrate that sufficient O2 supply is critical both for reabsorption of Na+ and for handling of PAH. Increased tubular Na reabsorption in the absence of PAH indicates that even during perfusion with O2 43 Ob2 supply is marginal.},

The neutral steroids are converted into MO-TMS derivatives which are purified by rapid filtration through a 0.25 g column of Lipidex 5000 in hexane containing pyridine, hexameth-yidisilazane and dimethoxypropane to prevent hydrolysis of TMS ethers. Estrogens are converted into TMS ethers. The recoveries of added [3H]-labelled neutral steroids and estrogens are about 85%. Sample sizes corresponding to 1-2 ml plasma can be injected onto glass capillary columns. The derivatives are analyzed by repetitive scanning GC-MS using a glass capillary column connected via a single-stage adjustable jet separator. Metal surfaces are deactivated with water glass and benzyltri-phenylphosphonium chloride, and a Teflon coupling device is used for glass-glass capillary connections. Characterization and quantitation of steroids is based on computer construction of fragment ion current chromatograms. When the method was applied to the analysis of unconjugated steroids in plasma from pregnant women, 27 steroids in the concentration range 1-300 ng/ml could be identified. The 13 major pregnane derivatives were quantitated. The coefficients of variation were 5-13% when 5 analyses of the same sample were performed. © 1977.},

Atmospheric particulate samples are collected on polystyrene filters using hi-vol samplers. The filters are dry ashed at 400–425°C and the residue is dissolved with a mixture of HF, HCl, and HNO3 in Teflon acid digestion bombs. With the appropriate dilutions and matrix corrections, it is possible quantitatively to measure 22 metals in atmospheric particulate matter. The elements measured by this procedure are Si, Al, Ca, Fe, K, Na, Mg, Pb, Cu, Ti, Zn, Sr, Ni, V, Mn, Cr, Rb, Li, Bi, Co, Cs, and Be. Although it is possible to observe Cd in samples collected and prepared by this technique, it is probable that Cd is partially volatilized during ashing of the sample. Recovery data for the ashing and dissolution of synthetic samples added to the filter material are presented. Data are also presented for the atmospheric concentration of elements in particulate samples analyzed by this procedure. © 1974, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The Murchison meteorite contains aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons similar to those made in static Fischer-Tropsch-type syntheses. Principal compound classes above C8 are n-alkanes, mono- and dimethylalkanes, alkenes, alkylbenzenes and -naphthalenes. Below C8, n-alkanes are virtually absent; instead, benzene, toluene, branched alkanes dominate. The CH4/C2H6 ratio is greater than 30, possibly greater than 700. Isoprenoids from C17 to C20 occur in a surface rinse but not in subsequent extracts and appear to be terrestrial contaminants. Thiophenes, porphyrin-like pigments and chlorobenzenes were also found; the latter appear to be contaminants. In the Allende meteorite, only methane, benzene, toluene and an aromatic polymer seem to be indigenous. A comprehensive review of current evidence shows that Fischer-Tropsch-type reactions can account for most principal features of meteorite organic matter: hydrocarbons, nitrogen bases, amino acids, carbon-isotope fractionations and possibly pigments. Some features (aromatic hydrocarbons) require a reheating stage; others such as S- and Cl-compounds and the aromatic 'polymer' remain unexplained and need to be investigated. No other process is known at present that accounts for an equally wide range of evidence. © 1972.},

The correlation between the chemical shifts of nuclear magnetic resonance and the ff-constants of the substituents in various organohalogen compounds is considered.

abstract={Conventional polarographic procedures cannot be used in hydrofluoric acid solutions because of etching of the glass capillary of the DME. However, very rapid polarographic techniques with both ac and dc polarography have been shown to be effective because insignificant glass attack occurs in the short scan time. The necessity of constructing a DME from Teflon (Du Pont) or other hydrofluoric acid resistant material is therefore removed. The method has been applied to the systems Cd(ll), Tl(l), Pb(ll), Sn(ll), Bi(lll), Mo(VI) and U(VI) in 5 to 40% hydrofluoric acid solutions. The polarographic characteristics of most electrode reactions studied in aqueous hydrofluoric acid are consistent with those expected in a solution containing a weak acid. Analytically, the most significant feature is that, for any particular concentration of metal, the value obtained in most cases is independent of wide variations in the hydrofluoric acid concentration. This simplifies analysis of mineralogical and metallurgical samples which must be dissolved in hydrofluoric acid. © 1969, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

The preliminary pressing of a Teflon ring against the surface is ensured by a metal expander ring. An analysis of the forces acting on the expander ring, and the interaction between the elastic forces of the expander ring and the forces produced in the piston ring, is presented, and design nomograms are developed. As a rule, the maximum allowable radial wear, determined from the condition of minimum specificpressure, is greater than that determined from the strength condition of the slot cut projection, particularly when the pressure drops acting on the piston ring are substantial. Consequently, for h-p piston seals, for which typically there is a considerable pressure drop across the rings, piston rings with an overlapping slot cut are unsuitable if the seal is not absolutely perfect.},

abstract={The measurement of transverse R/Q in iris-loaded waveguides by perturbation techniques is described. The underlying perturbation theory for resonant cavities is reviewed, and formulas for metallic needles, a sapphire rod, and a teflon bead are given. A calibration of the perturbing objects in TM010 and TM110 cavities shows good agreement with theory. Conventional oscillator and transmission methods are compared, and a systematic error of the oscillator method is explained. A more sensitive null method is described. A definition of the transverse R/ Q is given, from which it follows that the knowledge of the longitudinal electric field component is sufficient to determine the deflecting properties of a structure. The accuracy of perturbation measurements was tested on a cavity for which the R/Q was known from computer calculations and deflection tests. It was found that the various values agree to within 20 percent. Perturbation measurements of deflectors with small coupling holes showed the theoretically predicted interaction parameters. Values close to 2.2 kΩ/m at 2.856 GHz were measured on a ¾r wave structure with about a 2-cm beam hole. Copyright © 1968 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.},

A three-dimensional single-crystal X-ray analysis, based on 960 independent reflections, using conventional Patterson, Fourier, and least-squares refinement techniques has led to the location of all atoms except hydrogens, with estimated standard deviations ranging from 0.003 Å. for the rhodium-iodine vector to 0.04 Å. for carbon-carbon distances. The final value for the discrepancy index, R1, is 6.98%. An interesting result of the analysis is that the rhodium-carbon bond distance for the perfluoroethyl group is only 0.11 Å. longer than the rhodium-carbonyl bond length. On allowing for the 0.07 Å. difference in the radii of sp3 and sp hybridized carbon atoms, the effective difference in rhodium-carbon bond lengths decreases to only 0.04 Å. (~1.3σ). This, coupled with the distortion of the α carbon atom of the perfluoroethyl group from a regular tetrahedral environment, gives some weight to the proposal that the perfluoroethyl group participates in metal-ligand (dπ-σ∗) back donation. A comparison with known metal-carbon bond lengths suggests that for certain transition metal complexes, the metal-perfluoroalkyl linkage may be some 0.2-0.3 Å. shorter than the metal-carbon bond in an analogous nonfluorinated metal-alkyl. © 1965, American Chemical Society.

abstract={Plastic, paper and cardboard are widely used as food contact materials (FCMs), due to its numerous favourable characteristics. However, they are usually coated with hazardous substances, such as per-and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs). PFASs, with its functional properties of oil-and water-repellency, can migrate from FCMs into the food and cause potential risk to human health. There are also increasing concerns about the harm that FCMs can cause to the environment. These concerns include accumulation of non-degradable plastics in the environment, generation of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics, and release of PFASs from FCMs. While many reviews have been conducted on PFASs in the environment, including their occurrence, fate, toxicity, biodegradation, migration in ecosystems and remediation technologies, a systematic review of PFASs in FCMs and MPs is currently lacking. In addition, our knowledge of the PFAS sorption processes on MPs is rather limited, and in particular their desorption processes. Thus, this review aims to (1) review the presence of various classes of PFASs in FCMs and their migration into food, (2) review the PFASs in MPs and summarize the sorption mechanisms, and factors that influence their sorption behaviour on MPs in the aquatic environment, and (3) identify the current research gaps and future research directions to predict the risks associated with the presence and sorption of PFASs in FCMs and MPs.},

abstract={Background: Humans are exposed to several per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) daily; however, most previous studies have focused on individual PFAS. Although attention to effects of exposure to mixtures of PFAS has grown in recent years, there is no consensus on the appropriate statistical methods that can be used to assess their combined effect on human health.        Objectives: We aim to perform a comprehensive review of the statistical methods used in the existing studies which evaluate the association between exposure to mixtures of PFAS and any adverse human health effect.        Methods: The online databases PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched for eligible studies, published during the last ten years (last search performed on April 08, 2021). Covidence software was used by two different reviewers to perform a title/abstract screening, followed by a full text revision of the selected papers.        Results: A total of 3640 papers were identified, and after the screening process, 53 papers were included in the current review. Most of the studies were published between 2019 and 2021 and were conducted mainly in North America and Europe; more than half of the studies (28 out of 53) were conducted on mother and child pairs. WQS (Weighted Quantile Sum) Regression and BKMR (Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression) were used in 36 out of 53 papers to model mixtures' effects. Health outcomes included in the studies are immunotoxicity (n = 8), fetal development (n = 7), neurodevelopment (n = 9), reproductive hormones (n = 6), thyroid hormones (n = 7), outcomes related to metabolic pathways (n = 16).        Conclusion: Studies on human exposure to PFAS as complex mixtures and health consequences have substantially increased in the last few years. Based on our findings, we propose that addressing risk from PFAS mixtures will likely require combinations of approaches and implementation of constantly evolving statistical methods. Specific guidelines and tools for quality assessment and publication of mixture observational studies are warranted.},

Scientists have been able to experiment with various waste-to-energy conversion technologies in light of this situation. This communication highlights and reviews WtE technologies to convert MSW and other feedstocks into electricity, hydrogen gas, bioethanol along with other value added products like fertilizer(s), platform chemicals as an environmentally friendly products. This review comprehensively summarized the dynamics, risk assessment, ecological influence, advancements, constraints and perspectives altogether in field of municipal solid waste management and treatment. Stare-of-the-art information on ecological influence and risk assessment in handling and transportation of municipal solid waste has been provided. Advanced trends involved in remediation of emerging pollutants and resources obtained from municipal solid wastes have been uncovered. Lastly, this paper comprises constraints and perspectives for uncovering MSW based circular bioeconomy aspects.},

abstract={A significant rise in the incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes has occurred worldwide in the last two decades. Concurrently, a growing body of evidence suggests a connection between exposure to environmental pollutants, particularly insecticides, and the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. This review summarizes key evidence of (1) the presence of different types of neuronal receptors - target sites for neurotoxic insecticides - in non-neuronal cells, (2) the activation of these receptors in non-neuronal cells by membrane-depolarizing insecticides, and (3) changes in metabolic functions, including lipid and glucose accumulation, associated with changes in membrane potential. Based on these findings, we propose that changes in membrane potential (V-mem) by certain insecticides serve as a novel regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism in non-excitable cells associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.},

abstract={Preterm birth is the second most common cause of death in children under 5 years of age. The etiology of preterm birth has not yet been elucidated. Although maternal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase the risk for preterm birth, associations have not been confirmed. We performed a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationships between maternal exposure to EDCs and preterm birth. A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid-EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies providing quantitative data on the association between maternal EDC exposure and preterm birth in humans was conducted in July 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. A total of 59 studies were included. The pooled results indicated that maternal exposure to metals (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.29) and phthalates (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.42) was related to an increased risk for preterm birth. Specifically, maternal exposure to lead, cadmium, chromium, copper and manganese appeared to be correlated with an elevated risk for preterm birth. Additionally, maternal exposure to monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was also associated with preterm birth. In conclusion, maternal exposure to metals and phthalates may increase the risk for preterm birth based on current evidence.},

abstract={Elevated demand and extensive exploitation of cosmetics in day-to-day life have hiked up its industrial productions worldwide. Organic and inorganic chemicals like parabens, phthalates, sulfates, and so forth are being applied as constituents towards the formulations, which tend to be the mainspring ecological complication due to their enduring nature and accumulation properties in various sections of the ecosystem. These cosmetic chemicals get accrued into the terrestrial and aquatic systems on account of various anthropogenic activities involving agricultural runoff, industrial discharge, and domestic effluents. Recently, the use of microbes for remediating persistent cosmetic chemicals has gained immense interest. Among different forms of the microbial community being applied as an environmental beneficiary, algae play a vital role in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems by their biologically beneficial metabolites and molecules, resulting in the biobenign and efficacious consequences. The use of various bacterial, fungal, and higher plant species has been studied intensely for their bioremediation elements. The bioremediating property of the algal cells through biosorption, bioassimilation, biotransformation, and biodegradation has made it favorable for the removal of persistent and toxic pollutants from the environment. However, the research investigation concerned with the bioremediation potential of the algal kingdom is limited. This review summarizes and provides updated and comprehensive insights into the potential remediation capabilities of algal species against ecologically hazardous pollutants concerning cosmetic chemicals.},

abstract={Sanitary landfill is the most popular way to dispose solid wastes with one major drawback: the generation of landfill leachate resulting from percolation of rainfall through exposed landfill areas or infiltration of groundwater into the landfill. The landfill leachate impacts on the environment has forced authorities to stipulate more stringent requirements for pollution control, generating the need for innovative technologies to eliminate waste degradation by-products incorporated in the leachate. Natural attenuation has no effect while conventional treatment processes are not capable of removing some the pollutants contained in the leachate which are reported to reach the natural environment, the aquatic food web, and the anthroposphere. This review critically evaluates the state-of-the-art engineered materials and technologies for the treatment of landfill leachate with the potential for real-scale application. The study outcomes confirmed that only a limited number of studies are available for providing new information about novel materials or technologies suitable for application in the removal of pollutants from landfill leachate. This paper focuses on the type of pollutants being removed, the process conditions and the outcomes reported in the literature. The emerging trends are also highlighted as well as the identification of current knowledge gaps and future research directions along with recommendations related to the application of available technologies for landfill leachate treatment.},

abstract={Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) can be found in air, dust and on surfaces in car cabins, leading to exposure to humans via dust ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. This review aims at describing current understanding concerning sampling, levels, and human exposure of SVOCs from car cabin environments. To date, several different methods are used to sample SVOCs in car cabin air and dust and there are no standard operating procedures for sampling SVOCs in cars detailed in the literature. The meta-analysis of SVOCs in car cabin air and dust shows that brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) have been most frequently studied, primarily focusing on concentrations in dust. In dust, detected concentrations span over three to seven orders of magnitude, with highest median concentrations for OPFRs, followed by BFRs and, thereafter, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In air, the variation is smaller, spanning over one to three orders of magnitude, with phthalates and siloxanes having the highest median concentrations, followed by OPFRs, fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and BFRs. Assessments of human exposures to SVOCs in cars have, so far, mainly focused on external exposure, most often only studying one exposure route, primarily via dust ingestion. In order to perform relevant and complete assessments of human exposure to SVOCs in cars, we suggest broadening the scope to which SVOCs should be studied, promoting more comprehensive external exposure assessments that consider exposure via all relevant exposure routes and making comparisons of external and internal exposure, in order to understand the importance of in-car exposure as a source of SVOC exposure. We also suggest a new sampling approach that includes sampling of SVOCs in both car cabin air and dust, aiming to reduce variability in data due to differences in sampling techniques and protocols.},

When it was administered orally to rats at 1 mg/kg, around 73-74% of the dose was absorbed, metabolized, and mainly excreted into feces within 48 h. The elimination of radioactivity in plasma and tissues was rapid, suggesting that exposure of epyrifenacil and metabolites is small. Metabolite analysis revealed that epyrifenacil was rapidly ester-cleaved to M1 and then mainly excreted into bile or further metabolized. No parent was detected in plasma, tissues, and urine. Remarkably, M1 was mainly distributed in the liver (at a concentration of 70-112 times higher than in plasma at a low dose). Furthermore, a significant sexrelated difference was observed in urinary excretion of M1. Considering the above observations with those in the literature, the organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) likely plays a role on the active transport of M1 in the liver and kidney.},

abstract={Laboratories, dialysis units, and other similar facilities are important sources of negative contribution to wastewater from healthcare facilities. They dispose of pharmaceutical residues as well as unsafe pollutants such as pharmaceutical remainders, hazardous chemical agents, pathogens, as well as radio-isotopes. Wastes from these departments may contain traces of pathogenic and cytotoxic microorganisms, as well as radioactive isotopes. This state of wastewater poses a chemical, physical and biological threat to the environment due to the significant amount of hazardous pollutants. It also poses a high risk to public health. Unfortunately, the juridical and legal system does not oblige them to take care of hospital effluents' safety before being discharged into the general sewer system or the environment. Since the risk associated with wastewater composition from medical institutions is enormous, leading us to ensure high-end preparation and treatment of such wastewater before it is discharged into the sewer. Many countries do not have strict standards and legal responsibility to discharge highhazard pollutants like those found in wastewater from medical institutions.        Consequently, it is time for concern since there are increasing amounts of such effluents, and there is currently no legislative regulation and high-quality treatment for emerging contaminants. Unfortunately, even many developed countries do not regulate pharmaceutical residues at the legislative level. For this reason, this review aims to highlight key points in current regulations, legislation, and guidelines for the control of hazardous pharmaceutical wastewater and emerging contaminants. This review also purposes to focus the practitioners' attention to the development and strengthening of legislative norms regarding the medical institution's effluent.},

We identified 11 studies on gestational diabetes mellitus, 3 studies on type 1 diabetes, 7 studies on type 2 diabetes, 6 studies on prediabetes or unspecified diabetes, and 15 studies on insulin resistance or glucose tolerance using the SCOPUS and PubMed databases. Approximately 24 reported positive associations, 9 negative associations, 2 non-linear associations, and 2 inverse associations, and 8 reported no associations found between PFAS and all diabetes search terms. Cumulatively, these data indicate the need for further studies to better assess these associations between PFAS exposure and diabetes.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analysis included available literature that documented medical and surgical interventions performed on POD1 review after pars plana vitrectomy. A meta-analysis of proportions was conducted using a binomial-normal model to analyze three data sets consisting of all interventions, medical interventions, and surgical interventions. Heterogeneity and publication bias analyses were performed.        RESULTS: POD1 reviews of 2,262 patients across 14 studies were examined to yield a total POD1 intervention rate estimate of 4.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0-13.9). When stratified by medical or surgical intervention, the intervention rate estimates were 4.1% (95% CI, 1.4-11.6) and 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3-1.3), respectively. The most common complication requiring postoperative intervention was elevated intraocular pressure.        CONCLUSION: Given the wide confidence intervals of the estimated intervention rates, variability in postoperative practices, and range of interventions performed, the POD1 review cannot be discarded in its entirety.},

Over the past century, ionic rearrangement reactions, in particular those involving cationic pathways, have represented most of the research. Alongside the renaissance of radical chemistry, radical-mediated rearrangements have recently seen a rapid increase of attention from the chemical community. Many new radical rearrangements that extensively reveal the migratory behaviour of functional groups have been unveiled in the last decade. This Review provides a comprehensive perspective on the area from the past to present achievements, and brings up the prospects that may inspire colleagues to develop more useful synthetic tools based on radical rearrangements.},

abstract={In view of water shortages, the development and utilization of unconventional water resources have been studied extensively. Treated domestic or industrial wastewater used for agricultural irrigation is an unconventional water resource utilization method. Due to the particularities of water sources, previous studies have mainly focused on changes in soil heavy metals, microorganisms, and organic substances and crop responses to toxic elements; thus, attention to soil salinity is of secondary importance. After selecting qualifying research, a meta-analysis was performed to statistically analyze the data of seven variables (potassium (K), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and yield) to 1) estimate the mean effects of treated wastewater (TWW) irrigation on the soil salinity, soil pH and crop yield; and 2) identify the wastewater treatment grade (primary treated wastewater (PTW), secondary treated wastewater (STW), and tertiary treated wastewater (TTW)) and soil texture (sandy texture, loamy texture and clayey texture) that benefit TWW irrigation. The results showed that TWW irrigation caused a significant accumulation of soil salinity, and the increase in cation content from high to low was K (90.1%), Na (59.9%), Mg (25.2%) and Ca (17.3%). EC also increased significantly by approximately 57.2%, while there was no significant change in pH, and even the crop yield presented an average reduction of nearly 6.5%. PTW contributed to the largest salt accumulation, followed by TTW and STW. STW showed a significant increase in EC but did not show a significant change for the four ions. In terms of yield, STW can increase yield, while TTW has the opposite effect. In general, the sandier the soil texture, the higher is the salt content detected, although the retention of salt in loamy textured soil may differ depending on the ions. The yield of crops grown increased in the clayey textured soil and decreased in the loamy textured soil. Our study elucidated the response of soil salinity accumulation under TWW irrigation and could provide a reference for unconventional water resource utilization.},

abstract={Purpose of Review Complications of prematurity consistently rank as the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 and as the leading cause of death in infants in North America according to Liu et al. Lancet (2016); 388: 3027-35 and Callaghan et al. Pediatrics (2006);118: 1566-73. Despite advances in prenatal care, prematurity remains a persistent clinical problem, with 1 in 8 births occurring prematurely (prior to 37 weeks of gestation) in the USA as discussed by Frey and Klebanoff Semin Fetal Neonatal Med (2016);21: 68-73, . Advances in neonatology including gentle ventilation strategies, permissive hypercapnia, and the use of corticosteroids have led to substantial improvements in survival; however, long-term survivors of preterm birth face considerable morbidities affecting every major organ system. Chronic lung disease represents one of the most common and significant long-term complications of preterm birth and is attributable largely to iatrogenic injury due to the underdeveloped nature of the alveoli and lack of compliance of the immature lung as stated by Behrman and Butler (2007). Conventional gas-based ventilation of the premature lung leads to barotrauma, inflammation, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) as discussed by Sinha and Donn Semin Fetal Neonatal Med (2006);11: 166-73. Recent Findings Since the discovery of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) over 70 years ago, liquid ventilation has been examined as a viable alternative to conventional gas-based mechanical ventilation in a variety of disease models, including that of extreme prematurity. PFCs are biologically inert organofluorine compounds with remarkably high gas dissolving properties due to weak intermolecular attractive forces, allowing dissolution of up to twenty times the amount of oxygen and three times the amount of carbon dioxide than water as discussed by Wesseler, Iltis, and Clark J Fluor Chem. Elsevier Sequoia S.A (1977);9: 137-46. These compounds have low surface tension, have low viscosity, are relatively dense, and have low vapor pressure (11-85 torr), permitting rapid evaporation from the lungs. One perfluorocarbon liquid of particular clinical interest is perflubron, a PFC with a bromine substituted for a primary fluorine. This compound has been used as a contrast medium and is radiographically opaque, allowing clinicians to examine lung filling in real time according to the study of Kazerooni et al.

abstract={Extreme utilization of pesticides for agricultural purposes increases the level of pesticide content in water. Seasonal use of pesticides can cause increased concentrations at potable water abstraction sites as a shock load, which can be difficult for conventional treatment processes to deal with. Choosing the right water treatment method to remove pesticides hangs on the nature of pesticides and the effectiveness of the technique. The focus of this review is to discuss the current developments and progress in the use of various techniques for possible removal of pesticides from wastewater. Some of these processes include advanced oxidation, adsorption, activated sludge treatment, bioreactors and membrane technologies. The solo and mixed treatment techniques have been reviewed in detail and analyzed rigorously. The utilization of hybrid disposal technologies exhibit potential for the development of innovative pesticide removal techniques. Form the process effectiveness point of view, it is very important to thoroughly analyze the composition of the influent and identify the best removal technique. Furthermore, study emphasizes on designing of water treatment plant, the decentralization of water treatment and economical approaches for removal of various types of pesticides from wastewater are discussed.},

abstract={Ensuring safe water supply for communities across the United States is a growing challenge due to aging infrastructure, impaired source water, strained community finances, etc. In 2019, about 6% of public water utilities in the U.S. had a health-based violation. Due to the high risk of exposure to various contaminants in drinking water, point-of-use (POU) drinking water treatment is rapidly growing in popularity in the U.S. and beyond. POU treatment technologies include various combinations of string-wound sediment filters, activated carbon, modified carbon, ion exchange and redox media filters, reverse osmosis membranes, and ultraviolet lamps depending on the contaminants of concern. While the technologies are well-proven, highly commoditized, and cost-effective, most systems offer little in the way of real-time performance monitoring or interactive technology like other smart home appliances (e.g., thermostats, smoke detectors, doorbells, etc.). Herein, we review water quality regulations and violations in the U.S. as well as state-of-the-art POU technologies and systems with an emphasis on their effectiveness at removing the contaminants most frequently reported in notices of violations. We conclude by briefly reviewing emerging smart water technologies and the needs for advances in the state-of-the-art technologies. The smartness of commercially available POU water filters is critiqued and a definition of smart water filter is proposed.},

abstract={Water is an essential nutrient that has primarily been considered in terms of its physiological necessity. But reliable access to water in sufficient quantities and quality is also critical for many nutrition-related behaviors and activities, including growing and cooking diverse foods. Given growing challenges to water availability and safety, including climate change, pollution, and infrastructure degradation, a broader conceptualization of water and its diverse uses is needed to sustainably achieve global nutrition targets. Therefore, we review empirical and qualitative evidence describing the linkages between water security (the reliable availability, accessibility, and quality of water for all household uses) and nutrition. Primary linkages include water security for drinking, food production and preparation, infant and young child feeding, and limiting exposure to pathogens and environmental toxins. We then identify knowledge gaps within each linkage and propose a research agenda for studying water security and nutrition going forward, including the concurrent quantification of both food and water availability, accessibility, use, and stability. By making explicit the connections between water security and nutritional well-being, we aim to promote greater collaboration between the nutrition and water, sanitation, and hygiene sectors. Interdisciplinary policies and programs that holistically address the water-nutrition nexus, versus those that focus on water and nutrition independently, are likely to significantly advance our ability to ensure equitable access to healthy foods and safe water for all.},

Methods We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases to identify RCTs, published until July 2020 that examined the effects of cement augmentation of internal fixation of trochanteric fractures. The primary outcomes were reoperation and Parker Mobility Score, whereas the secondary outcomes were 1-year mortality rate, EuroQol 5 Dimension, fixation failures, and adverse events. We conducted meta-analyses of the outcome measures using the random-effects models. We evaluated the certainty of evidence based on the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results We included three RCTs (326 participants). No significant effect was observed in favor of cement augmentation on all these outcomes. The certainty of evidence for fixation failures was very low and that for the other outcomes was low. The overall risk of bias for each outcome was high or of some concern in all included studies. Conclusions The effect of cement augmentation of internal fixation of trochanteric fractures was uncertain for the clinical outcomes due to the low certainty of evidence. Further RCTs with a low risk of selection bias may present convincing conclusions on the efficacy and safety of cement augmentation.},

abstract={Surface-pattern engineering, as a key strategy to fabricate high-performance Nafion membranes for fuel cells, plays an important role in surface functionalization of the membrane, optimization of the three-phase boundary, water management, proton transport, etc. Considerable efforts have been dedicated to developing advancedpatterned Nafion membranes with single-scale (nanoscale or microscale) and multiscale-patterned structures which are believed to improve the performance of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for fuel cells. In this review, the recent progress in surface-patterned Nafion membranes (SPNMs) equipped with single-scalepatterned structures (including nanostructured and microstructured Nafion membranes) is firstly highlighted. The structural features and construction methods of SPNMs are discussed in detail. The effects of single-scale SPNMs on the construction and performance of fuel cells are also analyzed. Followed is an overview of the recent advances in fabricating multiscale SPNMs based on different strategies with a specific introduction on the membrane related effects on fuel cells. Finally, the future development direction and certain perspectives on the current issues of SPNMs are presented.},

abstract={Due to their recalcitrant nature and ubiquitous use, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) will continue to be major water treatment hurdles. Although effective water treatment technologies exist for physical removal of many PFAS from water (e.g., activated carbon and ion-exchange resin), a PFAS-concentrated waste stream is generated as an end product that can potentially reintroduce PFAS back into the environment. Thus, there is an increased interest in developing destructive technologies to decompose and mineralize PFAS directly in water or in these waste streams. High energy electron beam (e-beam) accelerators have been used for water treatment to degrade a wide range of recalcitrant contaminants, including PFAS, since the 1960s. However, large-scale applications of e-beam for water treatment are restricted due to its high energy consumption and inability to treat large flow rates. Considering there are very few available technologies for destructive removal of PFAS, this study provides a critical review on the treatment of PFAS by direct irradiation of contaminated water by e-beam from an energy consumption point of view. To date, very limited studies have been conducted to investigate the success of this technology to treat PFAS. Results from the limited studies were not directly comparable due to the variation in operating conditions and water quality parameters used in the studies. Here, for the first time, we develop and apply the concept of electrical energy per order (EE/O) to assess the performance of e-beam for PFAS treatment. Results show that EE/O is a better performance parameter than the G value of e-beam for interstudy comparisons and to evaluate the effects of water quality and operating parameters on e-beam performance. We additionally developed a kinetic scheme to predict the performance of e-beam to treat PFAS and revealed that the competition between species to react with aqueous electrons is the determinant factor influencing PFAS degradation efficiency. Comparison of EE/O values of e-beam (range: 31-176 kWh m(-3) order(-1)) with other destructive technologies (range: 5-9595 kWh m(-3) order(-1)) suggest that e-beam, for PFAS treatment, is a promising approach under favorable conditions. This review further elucidates the feasibility and limitations of e-beam technology that could be improved upon to potentially make e-beam viable for large-scale water treatment applications.},

abstract={As an emerging pollutant, microplastics (MPs. plastic particles with size < 5 mm) pollution in water has acquired extensive attention in recent years due to their small particle size and stable properties, which can act as a carrier for pollutants in water environment and have toxic hazards to aquatic organisms. After entering into water environment, MPs are readily undergone varied types of weathering processes (i.e.. hydrolysis, photo oxidation, mechanical abrasion, and biodegradation), leading to shifted surface morphology (i.e., surface roughness, specific surface area, and size) and physicochemical properties (i.e.. melting temperature, surface charge, molecular weight, crystallinity, and hydrophobicity). Among different weathering processes of MI's in water, sunlight induced photo aging process has been considered as primary contributor, which will further impact the MPs behaviors, such as aggregation and deposition in water column, adsorption to organic and inorganic pollutants, leaching of additives. as well as toxicity to organisms in water. From the perspective of MPs aging mechanism. photo aging process of MPs in water environment is a free radical associated chain reaction process and readily to be affected by polymer types, plastic additives. halogen ions, and natural organic matters. These components are generally photochemical activated and prone to involved in the direct or free radical associated indirect photo aging process processed. However. limited information has referred the impact of plastic additives and water constitutes on the long term weathering process for MI's in water, which will pose a great difference between laboratory-accelerated weathering and long-term natural weathering. Studying the photo aging mechanism of MI's in water environment is of great significance for evaluating their formation process and potential ecological risks. Based on the above considerations. we systematically reviewed the photo aging and fragmentation processes of MPs in water environment. The content of this work contains: (1) Photo aging mechanism and changes of MI's physicochemical properties during aging process in water. Research results revealed that photo aging process could affect the molecular arrangement and mechanical properties of MPs, and further fragment into smaller size secondary MPs even in nano-scale particles, which is important to explain the formation of MI's in current water environment. (2) Critical effect of plastic properties. such as polymer type. size. and plastic additives on the aging of MI's in water, for the impact of plastic additives on the aging process of MI's. results in this work suggested that photo aging mechanism of MI's could be modified due to the presence of plastic additive (i.e., antioxidant and colorant). (3) Role of water constitutes (i.e., Cl-, Br, and NOM) on the photo aging process of MI's in water. The results emphasized the multiple impacts of water constitutes (halogen ions and natural organic matter) in the photo aging process of MPs in the water environment, illustrating that MI's may have different aging time and mechanisms in different water matrices.        Moreover, impact of microorganism induced biodegradation for MPs in water is also proposed. In further study, more concentration should be concerned on the combined effects of plastic additives and water quality conditions on the aging process of MPs, which is helpful to shorten the distance between laboratory accelerated weathering and long-term aging process of MI's in natural waters. Besides, results of this paper can also provide theoretical support for comprehensively and systematically assessing the environmental behavior, toxicological effects and ecological risks of aged MPs in natural water environment.},

abstract={Lithium-ion batteries are the state-of-the-art electrochemical energy storage technology for mobile electronic devices and electric vehicles. Accordingly, they have attracted a continuously increasing interest in academia and industry, which has led to a steady improvement in energy and power density, while the costs have decreased at even faster pace. Important questions, though, are, to which extent and how (fast) the performance can be further improved, and how the envisioned goal of truly sustainable energy storage can be realized.        Herein, we combine a comprehensive review of important findings and developments in this field that have enabled their tremendous success with an overview of very recent trends concerning the active materials for the negative and positive electrode as well as the electrolyte. Moreover, we critically discuss current and anticipated electrode fabrication processes, as well as an essential prerequisite for "greener" batteries - the recycling. In each of these chapters, we eventually summarize important remaining challenges and propose potential directions for further improvement. Finally, we conclude this article with a brief summary of the performance metrics of commercial lithium-ion cells and a few thoughts towards the future development of this technology including several key performance indicators for the mid-term to long-term future.},

abstract={The role of microplastics (MPs) as a vector of chemicals is generally recognized: a wide range of micropollutants have been detected in MPs sampled in different environmental compartments, and, due to their ubiquitous distribution, they can be transferred through aquatic and terrestrial organisms into the food chain. Providing representative models is challenging due to the intrinsic dynamic evolution characterizing the natural phenomena, which cannot be adequately investigated in lab experiments. On the other side, simulation/prediction tools are strongly required because of the long time-scale characterizing the MPs' persistence in the environment. This article provides a review of the updated literature on mechanistic models and predictive thermodynamic methods applied (or applicable), to describe the uptake/release processes of pollutants by MPs. Intrinsic and environmental factors influencing the process kinetics and the equilibrium distribution are discussed in detail. Mechanistic models and thermodynamic prediction methods are analyzed and their potentialities for application to MPs highlighted with specific examples. Finally, a critical analysis of the limitations related to the simplifying assumptions in modeling and to the representativeness of the lab-scale data is performed to evaluate their effects on the reliability of the predictions and to identify knowledge gaps and address future research needs.},

abstract={Background: Meta-analyses have shown firefighters to be at an increased risk of several cancer types. Occupational carcinogen exposure may explain these increased risks. This study aims to describe Norwegian fire departments' work conditions from 1950 until today, focusing on factors relevant for potential occupational carcinogen exposure.        Methods: With the help of a reference group, we developed a questionnaire on topics related to occupational exposure to carcinogens for the period 1950-2018. Selected Norwegian fire departments provided department-specific responses.        Results: Sixteen departments, providing fire services for 48% of the Norwegian population as of 2019 and mainly consisting of professional firefighters, responded to our questionnaire. The introduction of synthetic firefighting foams, more regular live fire training, the introduction of chemical diving, and a higher number of diesel-driven fire service vehicles were identified as changes thought to increase exposure to occupational carcinogens. Changes thought to decrease exposure included the switch from negative to positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatuses, the use of self-contained breathing apparatuses during all phases of firefighting, the use of ventilating fans during firefighting, increased attention to flammable materials used during live fire training, increased attention to handling and cleaning of turnout gear and other equipment, and installment of exhaust removal systems in apparatus bays.        Conclusion: Norwegian fire departments' work conditions have seen several changes since 1950, and this could influence firefighters' occupational carcinogen exposure. A peak of carcinogen exposure may have occurred in the 1970s and 1980s before recent changes have reduced exposure.

abstract={Emerging risk identification is a priority for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The goal of the Galician Emerging Food Safety Risks Network (RISEGAL) is the identification of emerging risks in foods produced and commercialized in Galicia (northwest Spain) in order to propose prevention plans and mitigation strategies. In this work, RISEGAL applied a systematic approach for the identification of emerging food safety risks potentially affecting bivalve shellfish. First, a comprehensive review of scientific databases was carried out to identify hazards most quoted as emerging in bivalves in the period 2016-2018. Then, identified hazards were semiquantitatively assessed by a panel of food safety experts, who scored them accordingly with the five evaluation criteria proposed by EFSA: novelty, soundness, imminence, scale, and severity. Scores determined that perfluorinated compounds, antimicrobial resistance, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, hepatitis E virus (HEV), and antimicrobial residues are the emerging hazards that are considered most imminent and severe and that could cause safety problems of the highest scale in the bivalve value chain by the majority of the experts consulted (75%). Finally, in a preliminary way, an exploratory study carried out in the Galician Rias highlighted the presence of HEV in mussels cultivated in class B production areas.},

abstract={Prenatal exposure to widespread environmental toxicants is detrimental to maternal health and fetal development. The effects of environmental toxicants on maternal and fetal metabolic profile changes have not yet been summarized. This systematic review aims to summarize the current studies exploring the association between prenatal exposure to environmental toxicants and metabolic profile alterations in mother and fetus. We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database for relevant literature conducted up to September 18, 2019 with some key terms. From the initial 155 artides, 15 artides met the inclusion and exclusion aiteria, and consist of highly heterogeneous research methods. Seven studies assessed the effects of multiple environmental pollutants (metals, organic pollutants, nicotine, air pollutants) on the maternal urine and blood metabolomic profile; five studies evaluated the effects of arsenic, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), nicotine, and ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on the cord blood metabolomic profile; and one study assessed the effects of smoking exposure on the amniotic fluid metabolomic profile. The alteration of metabolic pathways in these studies mainly involve energy metabolism, hormone metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation. No population study investigated the association between environmental toxicants and placental metabolomics. This systematic review provides evidence that prenatal exposure to a variety of environmental pollutants can affect maternal and fetal metabolomic characteristics. Integration of environmental toxicant exposure and metabolomics data in maternal-fetal samples is helpful to understand the interaction between toxicants and metabolites, so as to reveal the pathogenesis of fetal disease or diseases of fetal origin.

Removal of POPs using varieties of multifunctional materials have shown a promising prospect compared with conventional treatments. Herein, three main categories, including thermal degradation, electrochemical remediation, as well as photocatalytic degradation with the use of diverse catalytic materials, especially the recently developed prominent ones were comprehensively reviewed. Kinetic analysis and underlying mechanism for various POPs degradation processes were addressed in detail. The review also systematically documented how catalytic performance was dramatically affected by the nature of the material itself, the structure of target pollutants, reaction conditions and treatment techniques. Moreover, the future challenges and prospects of POPs degradation by means of multiple multifunctional materials were outlined accordingly. Knowing this is of immense significance to enhance our understanding of POPs remediation procedures and promote the development of novel multifunctional materials. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Progesterone, a critical hormone in reproduction, is a key sex steroid in the establishment and maintenance of early pregnancy and serves as an intermediary for synthesis of other steroid hormones. Progesterone production from the corpus luteum is a tightly regulated process which is stimulated and maintained by multiple factors, both systemic and local. Multiple regulatory systems, including classic mediators of gonadotropin stimulation such as the cAMP/PKA pathway and TGFp-mediated signaling pathways, as well as local production of hormonal factors, exist to promote granulosa cell function and physiological fine-tuning of progesterone levels. In this manuscript, we provide an updated narrative review of the known mediators of human luteal progesterone and highlight new observations regarding this important process, focusing on studies published within the last five years. We will also review recent evidence suggesting that this complex system of progesterone production is sensitive to disruption by exogenous environmental chemicals that can mimic or interfere with the activities of endogenous hormones.},

In addition to the identification of primary peroxygenases, different classes of enzymes were shown to display promiscuous peroxygenase activity. Even though enzymes with peroxygenase activity are promising industrial biocatalysts, further optimization of their properties is required for their effective use in industrial applications. Here we give a comprehensive overview of enzymes with peroxygenase activity and review diverse strategies, including directed evolution, rational approaches and the assistance of small functional molecules to improve the expression, catalytic activity, substrate scope or selectivity of these promising enzymes. Furthermore, we discuss the exploration of modified or unnatural cofactors to design artificial peroxygenases for desired reactions. The rapidly expanding field of hydrogen peroxide-utilizing enzymes bears a great potential to provide biocatalysts for selective oxyfunctionalization chemistry, contributing to the development of environmentally friendly and sustainable oxidation processes.        Peroxygenases are promising enzymes to contribute to more environmentally friendly and sustainable oxidation reactions in industry.

Significant progress has been made in greening sample preparation strategies by miniaturizing sampling devices and decreasing the amount of sorptive phase needed for efficient extraction of targeted molecules. In this context, the use of natural sorbents represents an additional and convenient option for green sample preparation. The advantages of using natural sorbents for extraction include their availability from renewable sources, low toxicity and biodegradability. In this review, we describe the use of various natural sorbents for metals and organic molecules extraction, focusing on the most innovative applications within the decade 2009-2019. Particular emphasis is given to the description of commonly used biopolymers - e.g. cellulose, chitin, and lignin - and their use in a variety of sample preparation strategies. We also refer to different functionalization approaches that enhance the extraction efficiency of natural sorbents. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={An increased risk of developing colorectal cancer has been associated with exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and alteration in the gut bacterial community. However, there is limited understanding about the impact of maternal exposure to POPs on colorectal cancer and gut microbiota. This study characterized the influence of exposure to a human relevant mixture of POPs during gestation and lactation on colorectal cancer, intestinal metabolite composition and microbiota in the A/J Min/+ mouse model. Surprisingly, the maternal POP exposure decreased colonic tumor burden, as shown by light microscopy and histopathological evaluation, indicating a restriction of colorectal carcinogenesis. H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabolomic analysis identified alterations in the metabolism of amino acids, lipids, glycerophospholipids and energy in intestinal tissue. In addition, 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota indicated that maternal exposure modified fecal bacterial composition. In conclusion, the results showed that early-life exposure to a mixture of POPs reduced colorectal cancer initiation and promotion, possibly through modulation of the microbial and biochemical environment. Further studies should focus on the development of colorectal cancer after combined maternal and dietary exposures to environmentally relevant low-dose POP mixtures. (C) 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Propose of Review Anthropogenic activities are saturating wastewater treatment plants and the environment with an increasing range of organic and inorganic compounds, impairing ecosystems and health. Filamentous fungi, with characteristic filamentous growth, array of extracellular and intracellular enzymes, production of surfactants, cell wall biosorption properties, and symbiotic momentum, can contribute to a paradigm shift on the perception of anthropogenic pollution. This review provides a critical analysis of the main bottlenecks for feasible filamentous fungus-including processes and proposes a holistic approach for pollution mitigation using filamentous fungi. Recent Findings Filamentous fungi can convert ordinary sidestreams into, e.g., feed proteins and biofuels. Economic and environmental studies support integration in established processes. Intersectoral initiatives, and economic and environmental studies, need to be motivated to increase the range of processes. Although massively studied, the transfer of fungal processes for the removal of micropollutants into real matrices is difficult. It needs to be supported by omics technologies for the study of microbial networks, and by efficient analytical techniques to clarify detoxification potential. The area can benefit from knowledge integration from fungal growth in ordinary sidestreams, and from economic and environmental studies. The interest in filamentous fungi for pollution mitigation is corroborated by an overwhelming amount of research; however, no full-scale applications are currently known. Environmental pollution is a reality and production of ordinary sidestreams and micropollutant-rich wastewaters continuous. The establishment of filamentous fungal processes needs collaboration among governmental authorities, industries, and academics in order to tackle knowledge gaps within the area and propose a holistic approach.},

The risks and benefits of mesh augmentation in PEH repair are debated. Mesh-related complications including migration and erosion are considered in this publication. Design A systematic literature review of articles published between 1970 and 2019 in Medline, OVID, Embase, and Springer database was conducted, identifying case reports, case series and observational studies of PEH repair reporting mesh-related complications. Results Thirty-five case reports/series of 74 patients and 20 observational studies reporting 75 of 4200 patients with mesh complications have been included. The incidence of mesh-related erosions in this study is 0.035%. PTFE, ePTFE, composite and synthetic meshes were frequently associated with mesh erosion requiring intervention. Complete erosions are often managed endoscopically while partial erosions may require surgery and resection of the oesophagus and/or stomach. Conclusions Mesh-related complication is rare with dysphagia a common presenting feature. Mesh erosion is associated with synthetic mesh more frequently in the reported literature. A mesh registry with long-term longitudinal data would help in understanding the true incidence of mesh-related complications.},

abstract={Background Despite many epidemiological studies having been conducted, the impact of postnatal exposure of endocrine disruptors (EDs) on testicular function remains a controversial issue. Aim To systematically review the literature and perform a quantitative synthesis to evaluate the effect of EDs on testicular function. Materials and methods A comprehensive search was conducted in the MEDLINE, Scopus, and CENTRAL databases. Eligible for the systematic review were observational (cross-sectional and cohort) studies with (i) adult men who had a high probability of postnatal exposure to EDs ("exposed"), (ii) adult men who had a low probability of postnatal exposure to EDs ("non-exposed"), and (iii) an outcome of interest [seminal parameters and reproductive hormone concentrations]. The continuous outcomes in each of the studies were synthesized by the random effects model and expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Thirteen studies, including 959 exposed and 907 non-exposed men, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Exposure to EDs was associated with decreased LH [SMD - 0.17, 95% CI - 0.33 to - 0.02, 10 studies (616 exposed, 563 non-exposed), I-2 40%, p = 0.09], progressive motility [SMD - 0.45, 95% CI - 0.77 to - 0.13, three studies (133 cases, 153 controls), I-2 38%, p = 0.20], and normal morphology [SMD - 0.50, 95% CI - 0.85 to - 0.14, eight studies (562 cases, 540 controls), I-2 87%, p < 0.01] compared with non-exposure. No difference was observed between the other study groups. Conclusions Postnatal exposure to EDs is associated with decreased semen quality. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that a disruption of testicular function mediates the deterioration in semen quality.},

Improvements in the circular economy and energy recovery from waste materials is another fast-growing concept for promoting sustainability and a greener environment. This review study endeavours to integrate the concept of wastewater treatment by waste materials (agricultural residue, industrial and municipal waste, organic and inorganic sources) and utilization of the used waste adsorbents for value-added products through further treatment. Although very few experimental studies were performed on this concept, this study summarizes the potential valuable products such as regenerated adsorbents, biofuel, soil amendment supplements and cementitious material by utilizing waste adsorbent. Production mechanisms of valuable products is discussed comprehensively. This review also documents the major emerging contaminants, the diverse waste materials as potential adsorbent candidates and conversion processes from waste into adsorbents. The outcome of this review promotes the utilization of waste into multiple useful products generation which may improve waste management and boost the circular economy. The integrated applications of this review describe the commercial window available to accumulate waste materials for large scale applications. Further, sources of energy and nutrients extracted from waste materials after treating polluted water in industries, municipal units and animal husbandries can be a significant contributor to commercial viability in the future.

abstract={Electronic waste (E-waste) recycling is a rapidly growing occupation in the USA with the potential for elevated exposure to flame retardants and metals associated with electronic devices. We previously measured polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in plasma from E-waste workers and found them similar to non-E-waste workers. This study focused on structurally related PBDE derivatives, the hydroxylated (OH-PBDEs) and methoxylated (MeO-PBDEs) forms along with metals known to occur in E-waste. Humans can metabolize PBDEs and some MeO-PBDEs into OH-PBDEs, which is a concern due to greater health risks associated with OH-PBDEs. We measured 32 different OH-PBDEs and MeO-PBDEs in plasma samples provided by 113 volunteers living in the greater Puget Sound region of Washington State, USA. We measured 14 metals in a subset of 10 E-waste and 10 non-E-waste volunteers. Volunteers were selected based on occupational and dietary habits: work outdoors and consume above average amounts of seafood (outdoor), electronic waste recycling (E-waste) or non-specific indoor occupations (indoor). A two-week food consumption diary was obtained from each volunteer prior to blood sampling. OH-PBDEs were detected in all volunteers varying between 0.27 and 102 ng/g/g-lipid. The MeO-PBDEs were detected in most, but not all volunteers varying between n.d. 60.4 ng/g/g-lipid. E-waste recyclers had OH-PBDE and MeO-PBDE plasma levels that were similar to the indoor group. The outdoor group had significantly higher levels of MeO-PBDEs, but not OH-PBDEs. Comparison of plasma concentrations of BDE-47 with its known hydroxylated metabolites suggested OH-PBDE levels were likely determined by biotransformation and at least two subpopulations identified differing in their apparent rates of OH-PBDE formation. The metals analysis indicated no significant differences between E-waste workers and non-E-waste workers. Our results indicate E-waste workers do not have elevated plasma levels of these contaminants relative to non-E-waste workers. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Micellar liquid chromatography (MLC) is a reversed-phase mode with mobile phases containing an organic solvent and a micellised surfactant. Most procedures developed in MLC are implemented in the isocratic mode, since the general elution problem in chromatography is less troublesome. However, gradient elution may be still useful in MLC to analyse mixtures of compounds within a wide range of polarities, in shorter times. MLC using gradients is attractive to determine by direct injection moderate to low polar compounds in physiological samples. In these analyses, the use of initial micellar conditions (isocratic or gradient) with a fixed amount of surfactant above the critical micellar concentration, keeping the organic solvent content low, will provide better protection of the column against the precipitation of the proteins in the physiological fluid. Once the proteins are swept away, the elution strength can be increased using a positive gradient of organic solvent to reduce the analysis time. This may give rise to the transition from the micellar to the submicellar mode, since micelles are destroyed at sufficiently high concentration of organic solvent. In this work, several retention models covering extended solvent domains in MLC are developed and tested, and applied to investigate the performance in isocratic, linear and multi-linear gradient separations. The study was applied to the screening of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in urine samples, using mobile phases prepared with sodium dodecyl sulphate and 1-propanol. Predicted chromatograms were highly accurate in all situations, although suffered of baseline problems and minor shifts for peaks eluting close to a steep gradient segment. Two columns (C18 and C8) were investigated, with the C8 column being preferable owing to the smaller amount of adsorbed surfactant. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Emerging contaminants in Tribal water have been unexplored until implementation of the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR) campaigns, which mandated the analysis of up to 30 new contaminants in drinking water every five years. As additions to the Safe Water Drinking Act (SDWA), the UCMR1 - 3 were created to assess contaminants which have not yet been assigned a maximum contaminant level (MCL) but may be regulated in the future to protect human health. While a handful of Tribes (n = 6) participated in UCMR1, public water systems (PWS) within reservation boundaries were intentionally included in representative nation-wide sampling beginning with UCMR2 after a period of Tribal consultation. Still, less than 3% of Tribal PWS were surveyed. The results from UCMR2 revealed that samples from all surveyed Tribal PWS fell below the method detection limits. Target analytes shifted to metals, perfluorinated chemicals, hormones, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), dioxane, and chlorate under UCMR3. Detectable levels of metals (chromium, hexavalent chromium, strontium, and vanadium), chlorate, and dioxane were observed, and in some cases, at concentrations greater than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) recommended health reference limit (HRL). The presence of elevated levels of vanadium, strontium, 1,4-dioxane, perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and chlorate defines a new set of emerging contaminants that needs to be considered with regards to risk, reporting and monitoring, and water treatment in Tribal drinking water.},

abstract={The metabolic responses of bacteria to dynamic extracellular conditions drives not only the behavior of single species, but also entire communities of microbes. Over the last decade, genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions have assisted in our appreciation of important metabolic determinants of bacterial physiology. These network models have been a powerful force in understanding the metabolic capacity that species may utilize in order to succeed in an environment. Increasingly, an understanding of context-specific metabolism is critical for elucidating metabolic drivers of larger phenotypes and disease. However, previous approaches to use network models in concert with omics data to better characterize experimental systems have met challenges due to assumptions necessary by the various integration platforms or due to large input data requirements. With these challenges in mind, we developed RIPTiDe (Reaction Inclusion by Parsimony and Transcript Distribution) which uses both transcriptomic abundances and parsimony of overall flux to identify the most cost-effective usage of metabolism that also best reflects the cell's investments into transcription. Additionally, in biological samples where it is difficult to quantify specific growth conditions, it becomes critical to develop methods that require lower amounts of user intervention in order to generate accurate metabolic predictions. Utilizing a metabolic network reconstruction for the model organism Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 (iJO1366), we found that RIPTiDe correctly identifies context-specific metabolic pathway activity without supervision or knowledge of specific media conditions. We also assessed the application of RIPTiDe to in vivo metatranscriptomic data where E. coli was present at high abundances, and found that our approach also effectively predicts metabolic behaviors of host-associated bacteria. In the setting of human health, understanding metabolic changes within bacteria in environments where growth substrate availability is difficult to quantify can have large downstream impacts on our ability to elucidate molecular drivers of disease-associated dysbiosis across the microbiota. Our results indicate that RIPTiDe may have potential to provide understanding of context-specific metabolism of bacteria within complex communities.        Author summary        Transcriptomic analyses of bacteria have become instrumental to our understanding of their responses to changes in their environment. While traditional analyses have been informative, leveraging these datasets within genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) can provide greatly improved context for shifts in pathway utilization and downstream/upstream ramifications for changes in metabolic regulation. Many previous techniques for GENRE transcript integration have focused on creating maximum consensus with input datasets, but these approaches were recently shown to generate less accurate metabolic predictions than a transcript-agnostic method of flux minimization (pFBA), which identifies the most efficient/economic patterns of metabolism given certain growth constraints. Despite this success, growth conditions are not always easily quantifiable and highlights the need for novel platforms that build from these findings. Our new method, RIPTiDe, combines these concepts and utilizes overall minimization of flux weighted by transcriptomic analysis to identify the most energy efficient pathways to achieve growth that include more highly transcribed enzymes, without previous insight into extracellular conditions. Utilizing a well-studied GENRE from Escherichia coli, we demonstrate that this new approach correctly predicts patterns of metabolism utilizing a variety of both in vitro and in vivo transcriptomes. This platform could be important for revealing context-specific bacterial phenotypes in line with governing principles of adaptive evolution, that drive disease manifestation or interactions between microbes.},

However, the number of reports has indicated its toxicity also such as hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, neurotoxicity, and immunotoxicity. Thus, in this article, we have analyzed the potential risks and benefits of zinc oxide nanoparticles. The data related to risks and benefits of zinc oxide nanoparticles have been extracted from PubMed (from January 2007 to August 2019). A total of 3,892 studies have been published during this period regarding zinc oxide nanoparticles. On the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 277 studies have been included for the analysis of risks and benefits. Emerging reports have indicated both risks and benefits of zinc oxide nanoparticles in concentration- and time-dependent manner under in vitro and in vivo conditions through different mechanism of action. In conclusion, zinc oxide nanoparticles could play a beneficial role in the treatment of various diseases but safety of these particles at particular effective concentration should be thoroughly evaluated.},

Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis. and Cochrane Library were searched for studies in English presenting outcomes of idiopathic full-thickness macular hole that FTC or RO (case reports/series of <5 cases excluded). Outcome Measures: Anatomical closure, postoperative best-corrected visual acuity, intraoperative/postoperative complications, and patient-reported outcomes. Meta-analysis was performed on aggregate and available individual participant data sets using the metafor package in R. Results: Twenty-eight eligible studies were identified. After reoperation, pooled estimates for anatomical closure were 78% (95% confidence interval 71-84%) and 80% (95% confidence interval 66-89%) for FTC and RO groups, respectively. On average, best-corrected visual acuity improved in both groups. However, only 15% (28 of 189 eyes) of FTC eyes achieved best-corrected visual acuity of >= 6/12. The pooled estimated probability of >= 2-line best-corrected visual acuity improvement was 58% in the FTC group (95% confidence interval 45-71%); meta-analysis was not possible in the RO group. The most common complication was cataract. Conclusion: Reoperation for FTC or RO idiopathic full-thickness macular hole achieved a clinically meaningful visual acuity improvement in more than half of patients; high levels of vision (>= 6/12), however, were uncommon.},

abstract={Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) has attracted huge attention recently due to its high energy conversion efficiency, low operating temperature and environmental benign. With the launch of the Mirai fuel cell electric vehicle by Toyota in 2014, a new wave of industrialization of fuel cells and fuel cell vehicles has been brought about. However, enhancing the durability of PEMFC and developing a new generation of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and fuel cells are still challenging topics in the field. The MEA is the core component of PEMFC, and its durability directly determines the life of the fuel cell. The MEA is mainly composed of a proton exchange membrane, anode and cathode catalyst layers and gas diffusion layers on both sides. In last decade, great efforts have been paid to improving the durability of MEAs/PEMFCs from three aspects, membrane, catalyst layer and gas diffusion layer. In this paper, we introduce these research works systematically, and a review and prospect for the research and development of this topic in the future is also made.},

abstract={Durability is one of the most significant technical barriers to successful commercialization of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells for practical vehicular applications. It is determined by the aging (degradation) and malfunction of various components during the long-term operation. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of degradation modes in different components is crucial to the development of high-performing and long-lasting PEM fuel cells. In this review article, the critical degradation modes in major cell components, including membranes, catalyst layers, gas diffusion layers, and distribution plates, are comprehensively reviewed and analyzed, and the potential causes are described. Advanced experimental techniques to investigate the PEM fuel cell degradation modes reported in literature include steady-state durability tests and accelerated stress tests (ASTs). The steady-state durability test is straightforward but time-consuming and costly; therefore, ASTs are often applied to accelerate durability testing. For comparable results among different research studies, the experimental protocols and conditions have to be consistent, and the details of these experimental techniques are systematically reviewed in this article. The experimental results with a focus on the degradation modes, degradation rate, and test time of the PEM fuel cells have been reported. Finally, in order to understand the root causes of degradation modes and to develop the mitigation strategies, ex-situ ASTs in literature have been reviewed, including the effects of cyclic temperature, humidity, water wet-dry, freeze-thaw, clamping stress, and vibration operations.},

abstract={Background Non-invasive molecular genetic prenatal tests (NIPTs) for trisomy have long been part of non-invasive prenatal diagnostics. In Germany it is currently being examined whether and for whom these tests should be paid for by statutory health insurance in the future. Objective (I) Diagnostic properties of NIPTs for the detection of trisomy 13, 18 and 21, and (II) hypothetical calculation of the possible use of NIPTs in different groups. Methods (I) Systematic search for primary literature and systematic reviews in MEDLINE and four other databases. Inclusion criteria: Studies in pregnant women; index test: NIPT using molecular genetic analysis of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood to determine the trisomy risk; reference test: cytogenetic diagnostics or postnatal clinical examination. (II) Exploratory search. Hypothetical calculations for (1) all pregnant women following the current procedure without NIPTs using the example of first-trimester screening (FTS), (2) application in pregnant women with an increased risk (e.g., after preceding FTS), and (3) application of NIPT in a population with and without an increased trisomy risk. Results In the 22 studies included, sensitivity and specificity for trisomy 21 detection were 99.13% (95% CI: [97.39%; 99.72%]) and 99.95% (95% CI: [99.88%; 99.98%]). The possible influence of test failures was not considered in the calculations, and thus the sensitivity or specificity of NIPTs may have been overestimated. For the detection of trisomy 13 and 18, the sensitivity could not be robustly estimated. Discussion In pregnant women with an increased risk, NIPT can probably reduce the number of invasive tests and thus the number of test-related miscarriages.},

The mechanism of the reaction is discussed on the basis of kinetic, spectroscopic, and theoretical evidence, showing that the reaction can involve both singlet and triplet excited states of the carbonyl compounds, the high probable presence of an exciplex, and the possible presence of electron transfer processes, and when triplet excited carbonyl compounds are involved, the presence of a biradical intermediate is observed. The reactivity of electron-poor and electron-rich alkenes is discussed. Regio- and stereochemical behavior of the reaction are presented showing that, in some cases, very high regio- and stereoselectivities are obtained. The possible theories explaining this behavior are presented. In this field, the stereoselectivity observed, when chiral auxiliaries are used, when the reaction is performed in organized media, and when the presence of a hydroxyl directing effect can be supposed, is presented. The effect of light, temperature, solvent on the reaction is discussed. The possible application of this reaction in organic synthesis is discussed, presenting both previous synthetic schemes where the synthesis of an oxetane is a key step, the possible use of the oxetane in synthesis, and comparing the photochemical approach with the other approaches used to synthesize the oxetane ring.},

We performed random effects meta-analyses for exposure to all PCBs, specific PCB congeners and risk of all NHL and NHL subtypes. The meta-RR for studies of occupational exposure, high environmental exposure, and no special exposure were 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84-1.03], 1.05 (95% CI: 0.94-1.16), and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.72-1.34), respectively, and the cumulative meta-RR was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.85-1.07). No positive associations were found for exposure to specific congeners, nor for NHL subtypes. The meta-RR for an increase of 100 ppb serum or fat PCB level was 1.02 (95% CI: 1.00-1.04). There was weak indication of publication bias. Our meta-analysis found no association between PCB exposure and NHL risk, in particular in studies of occupational exposures. We detected a weak dose-response relation; the possibility of residual confounding and other sources of bias cannot be ruled out. PCBs are not likely to cause NHL in humans.},

abstract={Canis lupus familiaris (domestic dog) possess a high capacity to metabolize higher-chlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to thyroid hormone (TH)-like hydroxylated PCB metabolites (OH-PCBs). As a result, the brain could be at high risk of toxicity caused by OH-PCBs. To evaluate the effect of OH-PCBs on dog brain, we analyzed OH-PCB levels in the brain and the metabolome of the frontal cortex following exposure to a mixture of PCBs (CB18, 28, 70, 77, 99, 101, 118, 138, 153, 180, 187, and 202). 4-OH-CB202 and 4-OH-CB107 were major OH-PCBs in the brain of PCB-exposed dogs. These OH-PCBs were associated with metabolites involved in urea cycle, proline-related compounds, and purine, pyrimidine, glutathione, and amino-acid metabolism in dog brain. Moreover, adenosine triphosphate levels in the PCBs exposure group were significantly lower than in the control group. These results suggest that OH-PCB exposure is associated with a disruption in TH homeostasis, generation of reactive oxygen species, and/or disruption of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in brain cells. Among them, OXPHOS disturbance could be associated with both disruptions in cellular amino-acid metabolism and urea cycle. Therefore, an OXPHOS activity assay was performed to evaluate the disruption of OXPHOS by OH-PCBs. The results indicated that 4-OH-CB107 inhibits the function of Complexes III, IV, and V of the electron transport chain, suggesting that 4-OH-CB107 inhibit these complexes in OXPHOS. The neurotoxic effects of PCB exposure may be mediated through mitochondrial toxicity of OH-PCBs in the brain.},

abstract={The emerging pollutants antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are prevalent in aquatic environments such as estuary. Coastal mangrove ecosystems always serve as natural wetlands for receiving sewage which always carry ARGs. Currently, the research considering ARG distribution in mangrove ecosystems gains more interest. In this work, we investigated the diversity of ARGs in an urban estuary containing mangrove and nonmangrove areas of the South China Sea. A total of 163 ARGs that classified into 22 resistance types and six resistance mechanisms were found. ARG abundance of the samples in the estuary is between 0.144 and 0.203. This is within the general range of Chinese estuaries. The difference analysis showed that abundances of total ARGs, six most abundant ARGs (mtrA, rpoB, rpoC, rpsL, ef-Tu, and parY), the most abundant resistance types (elfamycin, multidrug, and peptide), and the most abundant resistance mechanism (target alteration) were significantly lower in mangrove sediment than that in nonmangrove sediment (p < 0.05). Network and partial redundancy analysis showed that sediment properties and mobile genetic elements were the most influential factors impacting ARG distribution rather than microbial community. The two factors collectively explain 51.22% of the differences of ARG distribution. Our study indicated that mangrove sediments have the capacity to remove ARGs. This work provides a research paradigm for analysis of ARG prevalence and proliferation in the subtropical marine coastal mangrove ecosystem.},

abstract={The common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is a carnivorous cetacean that thrives in marine environments, one of the apex predators of the marine food web. They are found in coastal and estuarine ecosystems, which are known to be sensitive to environmental impacts. Dolphins are considered sentinel organisms for monitoring the health of coastal marine ecosystems due to their role as predators that can bioaccumulate contaminants. Although recent studies have focused on capturing the circulating metabolomes of these mammals, and in the context of pollutants and exposures in the marine environment, skin and blubber are important surface and protective tissues that have not been adequately probed for metabolism. Using a proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR) based metabolomics approach, we quantified 51 metabolites belonging to 74 different metabolic pathways in the skin and blubber of stranded bottlenose dolphin (n = 4) samples collected at different localities in the Southern Zone coast of Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Results indicate that metabolism of skin and blubber are quantitatively very different. These metabolite abundances could help discriminate the tissue-types using supervised partial least square regression discriminant analysis (PLSDA). Further, using hierarchical clustering analysis and random forest analysis of the metabolite abundances, the results pointed to unique metabolites that are important classifiers of the tissue-type. On one hand, the differential metabolic patterns, mainly linking fatty acid metabolism and ketogenic amino acids, seem to constitute a characteristic of blubber, thus pointing to fat synthesis and deposition. On the other hand, the skin showed several metabolites involved in gluconeogenic pathways, pointing towards an active anabolic energy generating metabolism. The most notable pathways found in both tissues included: urea cycle, nucleotide metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism among others. Our H-1 NMR metabolomics analysis allowed the quantification of metabolites associated with these two organs, i.e., pyruvic acid, arginine, ornithine, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid, and acetic acid, as discriminatory and classifying metabolites. These results would lead to further understanding of the functional and physiological roles of dolphin skin and blubber metabolism for better efforts in their conservation, as well as useful target biopsy tissues for monitoring of dolphin health conditions in marine pollution and ecotoxicology studies.},

abstract={Much progress has been made in the past few decades in understanding the sources, transport, fate, and biological effects of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in aquatic ecosystems. Despite these advancements, significant obstacles still prevent comprehensive assessments of the environmental risks associated with the presence of CECs. Many of these obstacles center around the extrapolation of effects of single chemicals observed in the laboratory or effects found in individual organisms or species in the field to impacts of multiple stressors on aquatic food webs. In the present review, we identify 5 challenges that must be addressed to promote studies of CECs from singular exposure events to multispecies aquatic food web interactions. There needs to be: 1) more detailed information on the complexity of mixtures of CECs in the aquatic environment, 2) a greater understanding of the sublethal effects of CECs on a wide range of aquatic organisms, 3) an ascertaining of the biological consequences of variable duration CEC exposures within and across generations in aquatic species, 4) a linkage of multiple stressors with CEC exposure in aquatic systems, and 5) a documenting of the trophic consequences of CEC exposure across aquatic food webs. We examine the current literature to show how these challenges can be addressed to fill knowledge gaps. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:46-60. (c) 2018 SETAC},

abstract={BACKGROUND: In cranial surgery, different foreign body (FB) materials are used and may be left intentionally or unintentionally in the surgical field after closure, inducing a foreign body granuloma (FBG). This is a rare complication in neurosurgery, but it may be a diagnostic dilemma, with sometimes medicolegal implications.        METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the English literature between 1965 and 2018 and found a total of 77 articles concerning 100 cases of FBG caused by retained material located within the cranium or surrounding soft tissues.        RESULTS: There were 60 females and 40 males, with ages ranging from 1 to 77 years. Most initial diagnoses were cranial/intracranial tumors, trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, intracranial aneurysm, hydrocephalus, head injury, infectious disease, and nontraumatic intracerebral hematoma. The interval from the causative surgical operation to presentation of the FBG ranged from 2 weeks to 20 years. Various radiologic modalities were used and histologic study confirmed the presence of FBG in all patients. Intentional FB was used and left in 77 patients, and unintentional FB was found postoperatively in 23 patients. Associated infection was found in 13 patients. Complete recovery was seen in 47.6% of patients with sufficient data.        CONCLUSIONS: Despite being unusual, a retained FBG should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient after cranial surgery. A history of surgery, clinical symptoms, physical examination findings, laboratory results, and the use of appropriate neuroimaging explorations may provide a correct preoperative diagnosis. In addition, unintentionally retained FBs are preventable errors in the operating room.},

abstract={Veterinary and human pharmaceuticals have been widely used in the developed world, thus increasing their accumulation in the environment and thereby posing ecological risks. Earlier studies report that active pharmaceutical ingredients induce hormesis in plants, i.e. at low doses may enhance plant health whereas at high doses may suppress plant vigor. There is hitherto no study critically reviewing the effects of antibiotics on plants within a hormetic context despite effects of low doses on plants can have implications to animals, including humans, and to ecological processes. This study critically reviews for first time antibiotic-induced hormesis in plants, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Hormesis was induced by several antibiotics in a variety of species and endpoints. The maximum stimulatory response (MAX) was commonly < 1.5-fold the control response and the distance from MAX to no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was commonly up to 10-fold. Further quantitative and qualitative evaluations are provided and discussed in relation to scientific and regulatory aspects. Low doses of antibiotics are equally important as high doses as they can negatively affect plants, depending on plant tissues and the time tissues are subject to exposure. Antibiotic-induced hormesis in plants provides a significant environmental perspective and should be incorporated into the hazard and risk assessment process.        Capsule: Common antibiotics released in the environment induce hormesis in plants, urging for re-examination of the risk assessment practices by worldwide regulatory agencies.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to identify potential mRNA expression changes in chicken livers associated with environmental exposure to dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites (DDTs). In particular, we focused on genes relating to the immune system and metabolism. We analyzed liver samples from free-ranging chickens in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, for contamination by DDTs. This area predominantly uses DDT in its malaria control program, and homes are sprayed annually with the pesticide. Genes relating to the immune system and metabolism were selected as potential genetic biomarkers that could be linked to higher contamination with DDTs. RT-qPCR analysis on 39 samples showed strong correlations between DDTs contamination and mRNA expression for the following genes: AvBD1, AvBD2, AvBD6 and AvBD7(down-regulated), and CYP17, ELOVL2 and SOLE (up-regulated). This study shows for the first time interesting and significant correlations between genetic material collected from environmentally-exposed chickens and mRNA expression of several genes involved in immunity and metabolism. These findings show the usefulness of analysis on field samples from a region with high levels of environmental contamination in detecting potential biomarkers of exposure. In particular, we observed clear effects from DDT contamination on mRNA expression of genes involved in immune suppression, endocrine-disrupting effects, and lipid dysregulation. These results are of interest in guiding future studies to further elucidate the pathways involved in and clinical importance of toxicity associated with DDT exposure from contaminated environments, to ascertain the health risk to livestock and any subsequent risks to food security for people.},

This review briefly consolidates the currently available literature to comprehend the overall adsorption mechanisms of organic and inorganic contaminants through biochar. Generally, biochar produced at low pyrolysis temperature is suitable for the adsorption of inorganic contaminants by following the adsorption mechanisms of electrostatic interaction, precipitation, and ion exchange. However, relatively high pyrolysis temperature favors the adsorption of organic contaminants by increasing the surface area and micropores of biochar along with pore filling and hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction as predominant adsorption mechanisms. This review also summarizes the critical factors (pyrolysis temperature, solution pH, dosage of biochar, contact time, co-existed ions, modification/activation, aging process, etc) affecting the overall adsorption efficiency of the biochar. Overall, further field studies and experimentation are required for the reduction of cost in biochar production and its reuse.},

abstract={Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been extensively used as flame retardants in consumer products. PBDEs rapidly bioaccumulate in the environment, food, wild animals and humans. In this review, we investigated the harmful effects of PBDEs on humans, especially in early life, and summarised the levels of PBDEs in human biological samples (breast milk, cord blood and placentas). In addition, we described the spatiotemporal distribution of PBDEs in this review. PBDE levels in breast milk, cord blood and placentas were generally higher in North America than in other regions, such as Asia, Europe, Oceania and Africa. However, high levels of PBDEs in human biological samples were detected at e-waste recycling sites in South China, East China and South Korea. This finding suggests that newborns living in e-waste regions are exposed to high levels of PBDEs during prenatal and postnatal periods. The time trends of PBDE concentration differed according to the region. Few studies have investigated PBDE levels in humans from 1967 to 2000, but they increased rapidly after 2000. PBDE concentration peaked at approximately 2006 globally. Compared with other PBDE congeners, BDE-47, BDE-153 and BDE-209 were the major components, but the detection rate of BDE-209 was lower than those of others. Future studies should focus on determining the BDE-209 concentration, which requires the implementation of different analytical approaches. Additionally, the levels of PBDEs in human samples and the environment should be monitored, especially in e-waste recycling regions.},

abstract={Energy balance involves the adjustment of food intake, energy expenditure and body fat reserves through homeostatic pathways. These pathways include a multitude of biochemical reactions, as well as hormonal cues. Dysfunction of this homeostatic control system results in common metabolism-related pathologies, which include obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metabolism-disrupting chemicals (MDCs) are a particular class of endocrine-disrupting chemicals that affect energy homeostasis. MDCs affect multiple endocrine mechanisms and thus different cell types that are implicated in metabolic control. MDCs affect gene expression and the biosynthesis of key enzymes, hormones and adipokines that are essential for controlling energy homeostasis. This multifaceted spectrum of actions precludes compensatory responses and favours metabolic disorders. Herein, we review the main mechanisms used by MDCs to alter energy balance. This work should help to identify new MDCs, as well as novel targets of their action.},

abstract={Indoor environments can influence human environmental chemical exposures and, ultimately, public health. Furniture, electronics, personal care and cleaning products, floor coverings and other consumer products contain chemicals that can end up in the indoor air and settled dust. Consumer product chemicals such as phthalates, phenols, flame retardants and per-and polyfluorinated alkyl substances are widely detected in the US general population, including vulnerable populations, and are associated with adverse health effects such as reproductive and endocrine toxicity. We discuss the implications of our recent meta-analysis describing the patterns of chemical exposures and the ubiquity of multiple chemicals in indoor environments. To reduce the likelihood of exposures to these toxic chemicals, we then discuss approaches for exposure mitigation: targeting individual behaviour change, household maintenance and purchasing decisions, consumer advocacy and corporate responsibility in consumer markets, and regulatory action via state/federal policies. There is a need to further develop evidence-based strategies for chemical exposure reduction in each of these areas, given the multi-factorial nature of the problem. Further identifying those at greatest risk; understanding the individual, household and community factors that influence indoor chemical exposures; and developing options for mitigation may substantially improve individuals' exposures and health.},

However, there is an undesirable impediment with this approach in that tumor tissues generally suffer from serious hypoxia, which significantly affects the efficiency of PDT. Additionally, PDT that consumes oxygen will further aggravate tumor hypoxia, thus potentially leading to multiple undesirable consequences, such as angiogenesis, tumor invasiveness, and tumor metastasis.

abstract={Background:Management of velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) has traditionally involved surgical repair to improve speech. Posterior pharyngeal augmentation using injectable synthetic materials has been advocated. However, outcomes have been equivocal. More recently, autologous fat injection (AFI) has been advocated for correction of mild to moderate VPI. However, long-term efficacy and safety of this procedure remain unsettled.Methods:A systematic review of the literature was performed. Available studies that reported outcomes of autologous fat velopharyngeal injection for treatment of documented VPI were included. Preclinical animal studies were excluded. Study characteristics, patient demographics, treatment details including fat harvest site, volume injected, and outcome measures were evaluated.Results:Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria, yielding 251 patients who underwent AFI. There was high variability in terms of indications for procedure and reporting of outcomes. Majority of studies required velopharyngeal gap closure of at least 50% in order to undergo AFI. Most common etiology of VPI was secondary to cleft palate. Some studies included patients with velocardiofacial syndromes. Improvements in speech and nasalance were reported in a majority of patients. Major complications were rare. Only 1 patient with graft hypertrophy resulting in obstructive sleep apnea was reported.Conclusion:Autologous fat injection offers a minimally invasive approach to the treatment of VPI. Current literature is limited to small noncomparative studies. These appear to suggest efficacy and safety in mild to moderate patients with VPI. Future prospective studies with standardized technique and objective outcomes are required to definitively establish its safety and efficacy, as well as define patient selection criteria.},

Objectives To conduct a systematic review on the combined impact and interaction of prenatal exposure to stress and chemicals on developmental outcomes.        Methods We used the first three steps of the Navigation Guide systematic review. We wrote a protocol, performed a robust literature search to identify relevant animal and human studies and extracted data on developmental outcomes. For the most common outcome (fetal growth), we evaluated risk of bias, calculated effect sizes for main effects of individual and combined exposures, and performed a random effects meta-analysis of those studies reporting on odds of low birthweight (LBW) by smoking and socioeconomic status (SES).        Results We identified 17 human-and 22 animal-studies of combined chemical and stress exposures and fetal growth. Human studies tended to have a lower risk of bias across nine domains. Generally, we found stronger effects for chemicals than stress, and these exposures were associated with reduced fetal growth in the low-stress group and the association was often greater in high stress groups, with limited evidence of effect modification. We found smoking associated with significantly increased odds of LBW, with a greater effect for high stress (low SES; OR 4.75 (2.46 -9.16)) compared to low stress (high SES; OR 1.95 (95% CI 1.53 -2.48)). Animal studies generally had a high risk of bias with no significant combined effect or effect modification.        Conclusions We found that despite concern for the combined effects of environmental chemicals and stress, this is still an under-studied topic, though limited available human studies indicate chemical exposures exert stronger effects than stress, and this effect is generally larger in the presence of stress.},

abstract={Endocrine disruptive chemicals (EDCs) cause adverse health effects through interaction with endocrine systems. They are classified by chemical structure, effects on specific endocrine systems, bioaccumulation, persistence in the environment, or clinically observable effects. For research of the complex mechanisms of action in the human body, only in vitro model systems have so far been available, that have insufficient high-throughput capacity, which makes risk evaluation more difficult. In addition, in industrial nations, living people are often exposed to mixtures of substances, with various effects. The clinical importance of epigenetic changes caused by the action of EDCs during vulnerable phases of development is currently unclear. Epidemiological studies are criticized because reproducibility is not always guaranteed. Nevertheless, they remain the method of choice for the development and analysis of suitable model systems. Positive associations, in spite of sometimes conflicting results, are key in the selection of factors that can then be analysed in model systems in an unbiased way. This article depicts the mainly positive epidemiological findings for EDC-caused effects in the fields of growth and metabolism, neurocognitive development and sexual development and reproduction. As a result, there is a need for closer linkage between epidemiological studies and mechanistic research into model systems, especially focusing on the interaction of different EDCs and the consequences of prenatal and early life exposure.},

abstract={Sonophotocatalysis (SPC) is considered to be one of the important wastewater treatment techniques and hence attracted the attention of researchers to eliminate recalcitrant hazardous organic pollutants from aqueous phase. In general, SPC refers to the integrated use of ultrasonic sound waves, ultraviolet radiation and the addition of a semiconductor material which functions as a photocatalyst. Current research has brought numerous improvements in the SPC based treatment by opting visible light irradiation, nanocomposite catalysts and numerous catalyst supports for better stability and performance. This review accomplishes a critical analysis with respect to the recent advancements. The efficiency of SPC based treatments has been analyzed by considering the individual methods i.e. sonolysis, photocatalysis, sonophotolysis, sono-ozone, photo-Fenton and sono-Fenton. Besides, the essential parameters such as solution temperature, concentrations of initial pollutant and catalyst, initial pH, dosages of Fenton's reagent and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ultrasonic power density, gas sparging, addition of radical scavenger, addition of carbon tetrachloride and methanol have been discussed with suggestions for the selection of optimum parameters. A higher synergistic pollutant removal rate has been reported during SPC treatment as compared to individual methods and the implementation of numerous doping materials and supports for the photocatalyst enhances the degradation rate of pollutants using DSPC under both visible and UV irradiation. Overall, SPC and DSPC based wastewater treatments are emerging as potential techniques as they provide effective solution in removing the recalcitrant organic pollutants and progressive research is expected to bring out superior treatment efficiency using these advanced technologies. Importance of this review: The review has accomplished a thorough and a critical analysis of sonophotocatalysis (SPC) based on the recently published journals. Recent advancements in the doped sonophotocatalysis (DSPC) and the mechanisms behind synergistic enhancement in the pollutant degradation rate have been discussed with justifications. Besides, the possible future works are suggested for the advancements in sonophotocatalysis based treatment. This review will be beneficial for electing a SPC based method because of the accomplished sharp comparisons among the published results. The review includes current advancements of SPC based methods which aid for a low-cost and a large-scale wastewater treatment application. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The overwhelming population growth in recent decades and water crisis along with limited and uneven geographical distribution of fresh water resources is a growing challenge for the economic and human development. Wastewater reclamation and use could be an alternative for intact water sources and a promising solution to water scarcity and unequal distribution. However, wastewater is a double-edged resource both as an accessible water source for food production and human usage and concurrently may carry uncharacterized content with unknown toxicological profile causing acute or long-term health risks. Pharmaceuticals, cosmeceuticals, nanomaterials and their chemical decomposition derivatives found in wastewater are not well known in many cases. Their unknown toxicity, teratogenicity and carcinogenicity profile associated with lack of monitoring and control measures impose a significant hazard risk on the public health. This paper reviews the evidence on the health risks associated with the wastewater use for irrigated food production and the imposed risk on the end consumers mainly from pharmaceutical industry and related research facilities. Then, we suggest an applied framework for planning and policy-making to mitigate the health risks and optimally employ reclaimed wastewater for human purposes.},

abstract={The fabrication of micro/nano patterned surfaces using femtosecond laser micromachining technique has emerged in recent years as a new method. This is due to its applicability to virtually all kinds of materials in an easy one-step process, which is scalable. Here we present a review of the effects of femtosecond laser ablation process parameters such as laser fluence, scan speed, and beam overlap on the fabricated patterns on various polymeric materials: PTFE, PLA, PMMA, PDMS, and medical grade-PVC. In addition, it presents the physical and chemical properties of fabricated microchannels. SEM, XPS, profilometry, and water contact angle measurments are used to characterize the surface chemical, morphological, and wetting properties. The surface morphology and thus the wetting properties can be altered by tuning the laser parameters. By introducing micro/nano roughness to the surface of hydrophobic polymers, extreme water repellency and superhydrophobicity is developed. Various applications of these fabricated superhydrophobic substrates in biomedical, packaging, fuel cells, low friction, self-cleaning are also discussed to a certain extent. Surfaces with superhydrophobic properties are mainly obtained by a combination of appropriate morphology at micro- and/or nanoscale and low surface energy material.},

abstract={Although polymer electrolyte water electrolyzers (PEWEs) have been used in small-scale (kW to tens of kW range) applications for several decades, PEWE technology for hydrogen production in energy applications (power-to-gas,power-to-fuel, etc.) requires significant improvements in the technology to address the challenges associated with cost, performance and durability. Systems with power of hundreds of kW or even MWs, corresponding to hydrogen production rates of around 10 to 20 kg/h, have started to appear in the past 5 years. The thin (similar to 0.2 mm) polymer electrolyte in the PEWE with low ohmic resistance, compared to the alkaline cell with liquid electrolyte, allows operation at high current densities of 1-3 A/cm(2) and high differential pressure. This article, after an introductory overview of the operating principles of PEWE and state-of-the-art, discusses the state of understanding of key phenomena determining and limiting performance, durability, and commercial readiness, identifies important 'gaps' in understanding and essential development needs to bring PEWE science & engineering forward to prosper in the energy market as one of its future backbone technologies. For this to be successful, science, engineering, and process development as well as business and market development need to go hand in hand. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS.},

abstract={Organic pollutants, such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), antibiotics, herbicides, and bisphenol A (BPA), are commonly found in agricultural environments. They are released into the environment as a result of their use for human health purposes and farm management activities, and are often discharged as waste-water effluents. Most of these organic pollutants are taken up by plants through roots and leaves, and when they enter the tissue, they cause serious damage to the plants. Although the toxicity of organic pollutants to plants, especially to plant cells, has been intensively studied, a systematic review of these studies is lacking. Here we review researches on the toxicity of organic pollutants, their uptake, and translocation in plants. Our objective is to assemble existing knowledge concerning the interaction of organic pollutants with plants, which should be useful for the development of plant-based systems for removing pollutants from aquatic and agricultural environments.},

abstract={As a consequence of both increasing population and industrialization in agro-economic sector, Pakistan has inevitably been confronted by multicomplex environmental challenges. Owing in part to poor regulatory framework, pollution due to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has caused serious problems throughout the country. Resultantly, extensive use of POPs is causing vigorous deterioration of environment and human health. The current study addresses: (1) the general information on associated ecological effects and toxicity assessment by meta-analysis for local fauna and flora (2) their respective occurrence in living organisms; and (3) sources and distribution patterns of various POPs classes in environmental compartments of Pakistan. Based on the study, it can be concluded that the environment of Pakistan is highly contaminated with organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), dechlorane plus (DP), and polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), which is further supported with the meta-analysis. Nevertheless, unavailability of environmental quality standards and food safety for POPs render it a forthcoming challenge of multicompartment toxicity exposure. Therefore, strategies must be planned for risk assessment of biologically active POPs, while the POP waste inventory should be elevated, along with the necessary measures to promote appropriate handling and treatment of POP as a matter of prime importance.},

abstract={Aim: Our study aimed to compare the efficacy of two endoscopic techniques used for the correction of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR): subureteral transurethral injection (STING) and hydrodistension implantation technique (HIT).        Methods: A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, Google scholar, and Cochrane databases from 1984 to 2015. Meta-analysis of the selected studies was performed to compare the extent of reflux resolution following both techniques.        Results: Six observational studies met the inclusion criteria for content. These comprised 632 ureters treated by STING and 895 ureters treated by HIT procedure. All included studies utilized dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (Deflux) as the bulking agent. The overall resolution of VUR was significantly higher in HIT (82.5%) compared to STING (71.4%) [ pooled odds ratio (OR) = 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.69; P < 0.0001; I-2= 8%]. A subgroup analysis showed that HIT had better outcomes than STING for both lower grade (I-III) [ OR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.23-0.82; P = 0.01; I-2= 0%] and high-grade VUR (IV-V) [OR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.20-0.91; P = 0.03; I-2= 0%]. However, there was no statistical difference in the requirement of additional injections between STING and HIT groups.        Conclusion: HIT is superior to STING technique for resolution of VUR after Deflux injection. However, more randomized trials with longer follow-up are necessary to demonstrate the benefit of HIT compared to STING procedure. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Scientists have spent decades measuring inputs, storage and breakdown of organic matter in freshwaters and have documented the effects of soil uses, pollution, climate warming or flow regulation on these pivotal ecosystem functions. Large-scale collaborative experiments and meta-analyses have revealed some clear patterns as well as substantial variability in detritus dynamics, and a number of standardized methods have been designed for routine monitoring of organic matter inputs, retention and breakdown in different conditions. Despite the knowledge gathered, scientists have been relatively ineffective at convincing managers of the importance of organic matter dynamics in freshwaters. Here we review the existing information of the role of organic matter as a) an element structuring freshwater habitats, b) a source or sink of nutrients, c) a food resource for heterotrophs, d) a source of pollution, e) a modulator of the fate of pollutants, f) a source of greenhouse gases, g) a potential source of environmental problems, and h) a diagnostic tool for ecosystem functioning. Current knowledge in some of these points is enough to be transferred to management actions, although has seldom been so. Some other points, such as the interactions between organic matter and emerging pollutants, offer interesting research questions.},

abstract={Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a group of heterogeneous compounds of both natural and anthropogenic origin with highly persistent and bioaccumulative properties. They cause a range of adverse effects to human health and the environment around the world. There is growing concern that POPs may increase breast cancer risk due to their xenoestrogenic properties. The aim of this systematic literature review is to summarize and integrate the risks of breast cancer following environmental exposure to POPs (other than DDT) from primary epidemiological studies published between 2006 and 2015. After searching various databases, 14 case-control studies and one cohort study were included. Evidence of an association between increased breast cancer risk and environmental exposure to these chemicals is inconsistent and inadequate to conclude with certainty. However, most of the studies have examined exposure to the pollutants after diagnosis of breast cancer, overlooking exposure during critical windows of vulnerability. They have also largely focused on individual chemicals but ignored the combined effects of different chemicals. Therefore, major data gaps remain in examining exposure during critical windows of vulnerability and assessing combined effects of multiple chemicals. Development of better exposure assessment methods addressing these gaps is required for future research.},

abstract={Fluorine magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of chemical and physiological processes is becoming more widespread. The strength of this technique comes from the negligible background signal in in vivo F-19 MRI and the large chemical shift window of F-19 that enables it to image concomitantly more than one marker. These same advantages have also been successfully exploited in the design of responsive F-19 probes. Part of the recent growth of this technique can be attributed to novel designs of F-19 probes with improved imaging parameters due to the incorporation of paramagnetic metal ions. In this review, we provide a description of the theories and strategies that have been employed successfully to improve the sensitivity of F-19 probes with paramagnetic metal ions. The Bloch-Wangsness-Redfield theory accurately predicts how molecular parameters such as internuclear distance, geometry, rotational correlation times, as well as the nature, oxidation state, and spin state of the metal ion affect the sensitivity of the fluorine-based probes. The principles governing the design of responsive F-19 probes are subsequently described in a "how to" guide format. Examples of such probes and their advantages and disadvantages are highlighted through a synopsis of the literature.},

abstract={Preeclampsia is a medical condition specific to pregnancy characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the woman's urine, indicating kidney damage. It is one of the most serious reproductive conditions, posing substantial risks to the baby and potentially fatal for the mother. The causes of preeclampsia are largely unknown and environmental contaminants merit further investigation. The aim of this review was to determine the association between environmental chemical exposures and preeclampsia. PubMed was searched for articles examining a priori chemical exposures and preeclampsia through April 2018. Studies were included in our review if they included at least 10 cases, evaluated preeclampsia independent of gestational hypertension, and used either measured or modeled exposure assessments. Our review contained 28 investigations examining persistent organic pollutants (POP) (6 studies), drinking water contaminants (1 study), atmospheric pollutants (11 studies), metals and metalloids (6 studies), and other environmental contaminants (4 studies). There were an insufficient number of investigations on most chemicals to draw definitive conclusions, but strong evidence existed for an association between preeclampsia and cadmium (Cd). There is suggestive evidence for associations between nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM)(2.5), and traffic exposure with preeclampsia. There is evidence for an association between preeclampsia and Cd but insufficient literature to evaluate many other environmental chemicals. Additional studies using repeated measures, appropriate biological matrices, and mixtures methods are needed to expand this area of research and address the limitations of previous studies.},

abstract={The ability of epidemiologic evidence to inform regulatory decisions is largely dependent on the coherence and quality of the published literature. This systematic review examines the quality and consistency of studies assessing health outcomes associated with exposure to triclosan (TCS), an antimicrobial chemical with a short physiologic half-life. We used elements of the Biomonitoring, Environmental Epidemiology, and Short-Lived Chemicals instrument to evaluate aspects of study quality. Each methodological domain - overall design, exposure assessment, and data analysis - was categorized according to three tiers where Tier 1 indicated the highest quality. We also examined consistency of methods, results and reporting as considerations for weight of evidence (WOE) assessment. Studies were considered sufficiently comparable if they addressed the same or similar research questions. Forty-two studies met the criteria for inclusion. Only one randomized cross-over clinical trial of TCS was assigned to Tier 1 for all three domains. Most other studies were assigned to Tier 3 for at least one domain. Although the available literature examined more than 100 different health endpoints and reported hundreds of different measures of association, few studies were considered comparable. For reported measures of association, most were not significantly different from the null; the few statistically significant results represented isolated findings without a discernable across- or within-study pattern. We conclude that the current body of epidemiologic literature does not allow a meaningful WOE assessment due to methodological limitations of individual studies and lack of inter-study consistency. On the other hand, methodologically stronger studies may be used to inform future research.},

abstract={Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), a ubiquitous suspected contaminant, is one of the world's most prominent brominated flame retardants (BFRs). In the present study, earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed to HBCD. The expression of selected antioxidant enzyme genes was measured, and the metabolic responses were assessed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to identify the molecular mechanism of the antioxidant stress reaction and the metabolic reactions of earthworms to HBCD. A significant up-regulation (p <0.05) of superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene expression was detected, with the highest gene expression level of SOD appearing at a dose of 400 mg kg(-1) dw (2.06-fold, p<0.01). However, the glutathione transferase (GST) gene expression levels did not differ significantly (p>0.05). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the metabolic responses showed that all groups could be clearly differentiated, and the highest concentration dose group was the most distant from the control group. Except for fumarate, the measured metabolites, which included adenosine triphosphate (ATP), valine, lysine, glycine, betaine and lactate, revealed significant (p < 0.05) increases after 14 days of exposure to HBCD. HBCD likely induces high levels of anaerobic respiration, which would result in high levels of ATP and lead to the disintegration of proteins into amino acids, including valine and lysine, to produce energy. The observed changes in osmotic pressure were indicative of damage to the membrane structure. Furthermore, this study showed that NMR-based metabolomics was a more sensitive tool than measuring the gene expression levels for elucidating the mode of toxicity of HBCD in earthworm exposure studies.

Methods: We searched the Embase and PubMed databases in accordance with inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality assessment was performed using the recommendation of the Cochrane Collaboration. All outcomes were assessed using odds ratio, standardized mean difference, and 95% confidence interval. The random-effects model was used to examine all the outcomes. Node-splitting analysis and the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin method were applied for consistency test and convergence assessment, respectively. The Aggregate Data Drug Information System was used for the statistical analysis. Results: In total, 31 eligible studies were included. The multiple comparisons indicated that PFNA for blood loss and non-union, PCCP for operative time and mortality, SHS for embolism, intraoperative fracture and later fracture, and Targon PF for reoperation and wound infection were the optimal treatments. Rank probability showed that SHS was the best option for blood loss, embolism, intraoperative fracture, and later fracture; and Targon PF, for operative time, mortality, non-union, reoperation, and wound infection. The subgroup analysis revealed that blood loss, cut-out incidence, and wound infection were lowest and the operative time was shortest with the PFN. Conclusion: No optimal internal fixation treatment was identified for femoral intertrochanteric fracture, but PFN may be a better treatment option for unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures.},

In this study, the differences in antimonate (Sb(V)) and arsenate (As(V)) adsorption reaction kinetics and isotherm characteristics on a poorly crystalline phyllomanganate (delta-MnO2) were studied. The potential mechanisms were identified using zeta potential, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The adsorption isotherm results indicated that the maximum adsorption capacity for As(V) was 1.5 times higher than that for Sb(V). The adsorption kinetics of Sb(V) and As(V) were well fitted using pseudo-first-order model, and the adsorption rate of Sb(V) and As(V) significantly depended on delta-MnO2 dosage and pH. At all tested pH values (3.0-9.0), the adsorption rate of As(V) was 4.0-7.7 times faster than that of Sb(V) at the same delta-MnO2 dosage and pH conditions. FTIR and XPS analysis confirmed that M (metal)-O was bonded with Sb(V) and As(V). The adsorption capacity and rate of As(V) were significantly higher than those of Sb(V), suggesting that delta-MnO2 had higher affinity toward As(V). The different adsorption behaviors of Sb(V) and As(V) onto delta-MnO2 should be considered in soils. (C) 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are included. The quality assessments are performed according to the Cochrane systematic review method. Fixed/random-effect model is used according to the heterogeneity tested by I-2 statistic. Meta-analysis is performed using Stata 11.0 software.Results:A total of 4 RCTs are retrieved involving 514 participants. The present meta-analysis indicated that there were significant differences between groups in terms of total blood loss (weighted mean differences=-131.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): -163.63 to -99.35, P=.00), hemoglobin decline (weighted mean differences=-0.31, 95% CI, -0.44 to -0.19, P=.00), and transfusion rate (risk differences=-1.11, 95% CI, -0.19 to -0.04, P=.00). In addition, no increased risk of adverse effects was identified in both groups.Conclusion:Local administration of tranexamic acid is associated with a reduced total blood loss, postoperative hemoglobin decline, and transfusion requirements in patients with intertrochanteric fractures. High-quality RCTs are still required for further investigation.},

The incidence of PVC-related BSIs was 0.18% among 85063 PVCs. Short-term PVCs accounted for a mean of 6.3% and 23% of nosocomial BSIs and nosocomial catheter-related BSIs, respectively. Prolonged dwell time and catheter insertion under emergent conditions increased risk of PVC-related bloodstream infection (PVCR-BSI). If approximately 200 million PVCs are successfully inserted into adult patients each year in the United States, there may be many PVCR-BSIs occurring yearly. Clinicians should obtain blood cultures in patients with evidence of PVC infection and systemic symptomatology such as fever, carefully inspect the PVC insertion site in bacteremic or fungemic patients, and remove PVCs associated with localized infection with or without associated BSI.},

abstract={Intrauterine alcohol exposure can lead to toxic damage to the fetal brain and therefore to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The estimated prevalence in Germany is 1 % and FASD persists for life. Not only pediatricians and child psychiatrists but also general practitioners, neurologists, psychiatrists, psychotherapists and gynecologists (plus broad areas of pedagogics and social work) are confronted with FASD.        Based on a systematic review and methodological assessment of the literature from 2001-2015, the multidisciplinary guideline group formulated consensus recommendations for the diagnosis of FASD. In this publication the differential diagnostic criteria for partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) are presented.        The literature search for pFAS, ARND and ARBD resulted in 365 hits and 58 publications were included for the methodological assessment. For the diagnosis of pFAS, two out of three facial anomalies (i.e. short palpebral fissure length, thin upper lip and smooth philtrum), at least three abnormalities of the central nervous system (CNS) and a probable maternal alcohol consumption are required. For the diagnosis of ARND at least three abnormalities of the CNS and a confirmed intrauterine alcohol exposure are necessary. The ARBD is rejected as a separate diagnosis.        Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis of FASD that are easily implemented in practice were defined. Regarding treatment and secondary prevention of complications, more research is necessary.},

abstract={Objective Our primary objective was to assess the difference in amino and fatty acid biomarkers throughout pregnancy in women with and without obesity. Interactions between biomarkers and obesity status for associations with maternal and fetal metabolic measures were secondarily analyzed.        Methods Overall 39 women (15 cases, 24 controls) were enrolled in this study during their 15-to 20-weeks' visit at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. We analyzed 32 amino acid and acylcarnitine concentrations with tandem mass spectrometry for differences throughout pregnancy as well as among women with and without obesity (body mass index [BMI] >= 35, BMI < 25).        Results There were substantial changes in amino acids and acylcarnitine metabolites between the second and third trimesters (nonfasting state) of pregnancy that were significant after correcting for multiple testing (p < 0.002). Examining differences by maternal obesity, C8: 1 (second trimester) and C2, C4-OH, C18: 1 (third trimester) were higher in women with obesity compared with women without obesity. Several metabolites were marginally (0.002 < p < 0.05) correlated with birth weight, maternal glucose, and maternal weight gain stratified by obesity status and trimester.        Conclusions Understanding maternal metabolism throughout pregnancy and the influence of obesity is a critical step in identifying potential mechanisms that may contribute to adverse outcomes in pregnancies complicated by obesity.},

abstract={Growing evidence indicates that exposure to organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) could increase non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) risk. However, results from epidemiological studies investigating this association remain controversial. We thus conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the association between OCP exposure and NHL risk. Relevant publications were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase and identified according to the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies (6 nested case-control, 1 case-cohort, and 6 case-control) were selected for this meta-analysis. We used odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate the relationship between OCPs exposure and NHL risk. The summary OR for included studies was 1.40 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.56). No overall significant heterogeneity in the OR was observed (P-h = 0.253, I-2 = 12.6%). Furthermore, OR estimates in subgroup analyses were discussed, and strong associations were observed for dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE, OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.66), hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH, OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.87), chlordane (OR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.48), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB, OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.99). This meta-analysis had suggested that total OCPs of interest was significantly positively associated with NHL risk.},

abstract={Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a typical toxicant and prevailing pollutant whose toxicity has been broadly investigated. However, previous studies did not specifically investigate the underlying mechanisms of its developmental toxicity. Here, we chose zebrafish embryos as the model, exposed them to 2 different concentrations of PCP, and sequenced their entire transcriptomes at 10 and 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf). The sequencing analysis revealed that high concentrations of PCP elicited systematic responses at both time points. By combining the enrichment terms with single genes, the results were further analyzed using three categories: metabolism, transporters, and organogenesis. Hyperactive glycolysis was the most outstanding feature of the transcriptome at 10 hpf. The entire system seemed to be hypoxic, although hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1 alpha) may have been suppressed by the upregulation of prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs). At 24 hpf, PCP primarily affected somitogenesis and lens formation probably resulting from the disruption of embryonic body plan at earlier stages. The proposed underlying toxicological mechanism of PCP was based on the crosstalk between each clue. Our study attempted to describe the developmental toxicity of environmental pollutants from a systematic view. Meanwhile, some features of gene expression profiling could serve as markers of human health or ecological risk.},

abstract={With production from gas/condensate reservoirs, the flowing bottomhole pressure of the production well decreases. When the flowing bottomhole pressure decreases below the dewpoint, condensate accumulates near the wellbore region and forms a condensate bank. This results in a loss of productivity of both gas and condensate, which becomes more serious in intermediate-and low-permeability gas/condensate reservoirs, where the condensate bank reduces both the gas permeability and the well productivity.        Several techniques have been used to mitigate this problem. These methods include:        Use of solvents and wettability-alteration chemicals to reduce the impact of condensate blockage        Gas cycling and injection of nitrogen and supercritical carbon dioxide as pressure-maintenance methods        Drilling horizontal wells, hydraulic fracturing, and acidizing to improve the well productivity        Gas cycling aims to keep the reservoir pressure greater than the dewpoint pressure to reduce the condensation phenomena. The limited volumes of gas that can be recycled in the reservoir can hinder the application of this method. For an ideal gas-cycling process, the volume of the gas injected into the reservoir will be larger than the total gas that can be produced from such a reservoir. Other approaches are the drilling of horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing, during which the pressure drop around the wellbore region is lowered to allow for a longer production time, with only single-phase gas flow to the wellbore. These approaches are costly because they require drilling rigs. Another technique is the use of solvents, which shows good treatment outcomes, but the durability is a questionable issue in these treatments. Moreover, wettability alteration needs to be approached very carefully so as not to cause permanent damage to the reservoir. The use of fluorinated polymers and surfactants dissolved in alcohol-based solvents for wettability-alteration treatments was reported in many studies.        Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, and can be applied under certain conditions. This paper presents all of these methods, along with their advantages and disadvantages and description of some of their field applications and case studies.},

abstract={A novel 1,1,1,2,2,3,3-heptafluorobutyl chloroformate reagent (HFBCF) was examined for in-situ derivatization of amino-carboxylic metabolites in human urine. The arising reaction products exhibit greatly reduced polarity which facilitates combining the derivatization and liquid-liquid microextraction (LLME) from an aqueous urine into an isooctane phase and immediate gas chromatographic-mas spectrometric analysis (GC-MS). The sample preparation protocol is simple, proceeds without an alcohol excess and provides cleaner extracts than other urinary GC-MS based methods. Moreover, thiol metabolites bound in disulfide bonds can be released by reduction with tris(3-hydroxypropyl)phosphine (THP) prior to the developed derivatization and LLME step. In order to evaluate potential of the novel method for GC-MS metabolomics, reaction products of 153 urinary metabolites with HFBCF, particularly those possessing amino and carboxyl groups (56 amino acids and their conjugates, 84 organic acids, 9 biogenic amines, 4 other polar analytes) and two internal standards were investigated in detail by GC-MS and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). One hundred and twenty metabolites (78%) yielded a single product, 25 (16%) and 2 metabolites (2-methylcitrate, citrate) generated two and more derivatives. From the examined set, analytically applicable products of 5 metabolites were not detected; the derivatives of 3 metabolites were only suitable for LC-MS analysis. Electron ionization (El) of the examined analytes contained characteristic, diagnostic ions enabling to distinguish related and isomeric structures. The new method was validated for 132 metabolites using two internal standards in artificial urine and with special attention to potential disease biomarker candidates. The developed sample preparation protocol was finally evaluated by means of a certified organic acid standard mixture in urine and by GC-MS analysis of 100 morning urines obtained from healthy patients (50 males and 50 females), where 112 physiological metabolites were quantified in a 25 mu L sample aliquot. The quantification data for the set were satisfactory, most metabolites were found within the range reported in the reference human metabolome (HMDB) database and literature. The reported results suggest that the described method has been a novel promising tool for targeted GC-MS based metabolomic analysis in urine. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of 2 surgical techniques that are used to treat proximal femoral fractures.        A systematic literature search (up to December 2014) was conducted in Medline, Embase, PubMed, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to screen for studies comparing proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) with less invasive stabilization system-distal femur (LISS-DF) for proximal femoral fractures. Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies and extracted data. Surgical information and postoperative outcomes were analyzed.        A total of 7 studies with 361 patients who satisfied the eligibility criteria included 3 randomized controlled trials and 4 case-controlled trials associated with PFNA versus LISS in treating proximal femoral fractures. Our results demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in hospital stay and time to weight-bearing ambulation and bone healing for PFNA compared with LISS (odds ratio [OR] -1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.92 to -0.05; OR -7.08, 95% CI -8.32 to -5.84; OR -2.71, 95% CI -4.76 to 0.67). No statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups for operative time, blood loss volume, Harris hip score, and incidence of complications.        Based on the results of this analysis, we inferred that PFNA is safer and more effective than reverse LISS-DF in patients undergoing osteosynthesis for proximal femoral fractures, and that PFNA is associated with reduced hospital stays and reduced time to weight-bearing ambulation and bone healing. Nonetheless, in certain cases in which PFNA is not suitable due to abnormal structure of the proximal femur or particularly unstable fractures, the LISS plate technique could be a useful alternative.},

abstract={Oxygen is essential in the energy metabolism of cells, as well as being an important regulatory parameter influencing cell differentiation and function. Interest in precise oxygen control for in vitro cultures of tissues and cells continues to grow, especially with the emergence of the organ-on-a-chip and the desire to emulate in vivo conditions. This was recently discussed in this journal in a Critical Review by Brennan et al. (Lab Chip (2014). DOI: 10.1039/C4LC00853G). Microfluidics can be used to introduce flow to facilitate nutrient supply to and waste removal from in vitro culture systems. Well-defined oxygen gradients can also be established. However, cells can quickly alter the oxygen balance in their vicinity. In this Tutorial Review, we expand on the Brennan paper to focus on the implementation of oxygen analysis in these systems to achieve continuous monitoring. Both electrochemical and optical approaches for the integration of oxygen monitoring in microfluidic tissue and cell culture systems will be discussed. Differences in oxygen requirements from one organ to the next are a challenging problem, as oxygen delivery is limited by its uptake into medium. Hence, we discuss the factors determining oxygen concentrations in solutions and consider the possible use of artificial oxygen carriers to increase dissolved oxygen concentrations. The selection of device material for applications requiring precise oxygen control is discussed in detail, focusing on oxygen permeability. Lastly, a variety of devices is presented, showing the diversity of approaches that can be employed to control and monitor oxygen concentrations in in vitro experiments.},

Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library.        Review Methods: A systematic search was conducted. Studies reporting original data on the effect of piston diameter on pure-tone audiometric results in patients undergoing primary stapedotomy for otosclerosis were included. Relevance and risk of bias of the selected articles were assessed. Studies with low relevance, high risk of bias, or both were excluded. Absolute risks and risk differences, means and mean differences, and 95% confidence intervals were extracted.        Results: Twelve studies with moderate to high relevance and moderate risk of bias were included for data extraction. Air-bone gap closure to 10 dB or less was assessed in six studies, the majority of which did not show a statistically significant or clinically relevant difference between two pistons with a different diameter. More importantly, the differences that were found were not consistently in favor of smaller-diameter pistons or larger-diameter pistons. Mean postoperative airbone gap ranged from 3 dB in favor of a smaller-diameter piston to 3 dB in favor of a larger-diameter piston across four studies. Permanent sensorineural hearing loss was assessed in eight studies and occurred in only one study. In this study, no difference was found between a 0.4-mm-diameter piston and a 0.6-mm-diameter piston.        Conclusion: There is not sufficient evidence to support the superiority of the use of a larger-diameter piston compared to a smaller-diameter piston for primary stapedotomy in otosclerosis patients.},

This study used bioaugmentation to investigate the biodegradation of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in sediment microcosms collected from an electronic-waste recycling site. Treatments included adding possible biodegradation intermediates of TBBPA, including 2,4-dibromophenol (2,4-DBP), 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP), and bisphenol A (BPA) as co-substrates. Bioaugmentation was done with Ochrobactrum sp. T (TBBPA-degrader) and a mixed culture of Ochrobactrum sp. T, Bacillus sp. GZT (TBP-degrader) and Bacillus sp. GZB (BPA-degrader). Results showed that bioaugmentation with Ochrobactrum sp. T significantly improved TBBPA degradation efficiencies in sediment microcosms (P < 0.01); aerobic conditions increased the microbes' degradation activities. Co-substrates 2,4-DBP, TBP and BPA inhibited biodegradation of TBBPA. A metagenomic analysis of total 16S rRNA genes from the treated sediment microcosms showed that the following dominant genera: Ochrobactrum, Parasegetibacter, Thermithiobacillus, Phenylobacterium and Sphingomonas. The genus level of Ochrobactrum increased with increased degradation time, within 10-week of incubation. Microbes from genus Ochrobactrum are mainly linked to enhance the TBBPA biodegradation.

abstract={In general, when performing untargeted metabolic phenotyping (metabolomics/metabonomics) studies on biological samples for example urine or food, sample preparation should be kept to a minimum. However, there are circumstances when desalting, preconcentration, or the fractionation of samples into polar and nonpolar metabolites is of value for enabling the subsequent analysis. Because of its simplicity and ease of automation SPE is well suited to such applications prior to analysis by ultra-performance LC-TOF-MS. In the present study, the properties of a range of SPE phases have been investigated with respect to the range of metabolites that can be extracted from urine. The phases include alkyl modified (C8 and, C18-OH and C18) silica and polymeric materials. The results show that the C18 phase was well suited to fractionating urine into samples suitable for separate analysis of polar and nonpolar constituents via HILIC and RPLC, respectively, while the polymeric materials were best for concentrating and desalting samples.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although the aetiology of IBD is not completely understood, an interaction between genetic and environmental factors has been proposed. In this context, however, environmental epidemiology lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the possible role of occupational exposures in IBD development and progression. Therefore, aim of our review was to evaluate how certain occupational risk factors may affect IBD pathogenesis, clinical history and severity of disease manifestations.        MATERIALS AND METHODS: A critical revision of available literature concerning exposure to groups of potential workplace hazardous agents and IBD, as it appears in Medline and Web of knowledge, was performed.        RESULTS: The role of workplace exposures to chemical and biological agents, ionizing or nonionizing radiations, shift-works, indoor, and sedentary works as well as job strain on IBD has been critically revised. However, the limited number of studies addressing these issues prevented us from extrapolating definite conclusions.        CONCLUSIONS: Our review pointed out some critical aspects concerning the relationship between occupational factors and IBD, in terms of causative pathways, hazardous exposure, susceptibility and consequences of IBD functional limitations on career choice and fitness for work that need future investigations. Overall, this seems a challenging public health issue, considering the strong IBD impact on patients' quality of life, work productivity and costs to society. Moreover, this review may encourage concerted actions of health care specialists, occupational physicians, employers and IBD workers to plan preventive and protective measures for "healthier patterns of work" for IBD and to develop innovative perspectives for an integrated management of "IBD at work".},

abstract={Dietary ingestion of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is correlated with the development of obesity. Obesity alters metabolism, induces an inflammatory tissue microenvironment, and is also linked to diabetes and breast cancer risk/promotion of the disease. However, no direct evidence exists with regard to the correlation among all three of these factors ( POPs, obesity, and breast cancer). Herein, we present results from current correlative studies indicating a causal link between POP exposure through diet and their bioaccumulation in adipose tissue that promotes the development of obesity and ultimately influences breast cancer development and/or progression. Furthermore, as endocrine disruptors, POPs could interfere with hormonally responsive tissue functions causing dysregulation of hormone signaling and cell function. This review highlights the critical need for advanced in vitro and in vivo model systems to elucidate the complex relationship among obesity, POPs, and breast cancer, and, more importantly, to delineate their multifaceted molecular, cellular, and biochemical mechanisms. Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies directly testing the observed correlations as well as detailing their molecular mechanisms are vital to cancer research and, ultimately, public health.},

abstract={The discovery of tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) began in 1986 with two unrelated observations: pressure applied unilaterally at the midurethra controlled urine loss on coughing; implanted Teflon tape caused a collagenous tissue reaction.        In 1987, Mersilene tape was implanted retropubically in 13 large dogs, with the aim of creating an artificial collagenous pubourethral neoligament. Extensive testing showed that the operation was safe and effective. In 1988-1989, human testing was carried out (n = 30). Mersilene tape cured 100 % of stress and mixed incontinence with a sling in situ; however, there was simultaneous recurrence of the two symptoms in 50 % on sling removal. X-rays showed no elevation of the bladder neck.        In 1990-1993, collaboration with Ulf Ulmsten took place: a permanently implanted tape was required. Polypropylene was the ideal material. In 2003, the neoligament principle was applied as an adjustable "micro" sling to the arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis (ATFP), cardinal, uterosacral ligaments, and perineal body for cure of cystocele, rectocele, and apical prolapse. It was found that symptoms such as urgency, nocturia, chronic pelvic pain, obstructive defecation syndrome (ODS), and fecal incontinence were frequently cured or improved.        The lecture concluded with advice to younger members. Without new paradigms, there are no randomized controlled trials, no meta-analyses, Cochrane. Indeed, no progress. Be open to new concepts. Read Kuhn's "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" to understand the discovery process. Examine the relationship among symptoms, ATFP, cardinal, uterosacral ligaments, and the perineal body. This is the next paradigm. Don't disregard anomalies. Pursue them. They are the pathway to discovery. Innovation is born from challenge, not conformity. Persist, even when meeting resistance. Resistance is a sign that your discovery is important.},

abstract={Introduction: There has been continuous debate on whether the Two-Layer Method (TLM) is superior to the University of Wisconsin solution (UW) for preserving human pancreas prior to islet isolation. The objective of the current meta-analysis is to assess which method is superior.        Methods: We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) for relevant human trials published in the English language from January 2000 to October 2013. Data on donor characteristics and islet isolation outcomes were extracted.        Results: 14 articles containing 18 human studies were included in this meta-analysis. In comparison to UW alone, TLM alone produced a significantly higher islet yield (weighted mean difference, 776.32; 95% confidence interval; 370.82-1181.82; P =.0002). TLM alone also yielded higher proportion of transplantable preparations (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval; 1.15-2.23; P =.005). The following measures did not differ: islet viability (weighted mean difference, 2.10; -2.41-6.60; P = .360), purity (weighted mean difference, -0.92; -3.75-1.91; P = .520) and function assessed by measuring the stimulation index (weighted mean difference, 0.17; -0.21-0.55; P = .380). When comparing TLM following UW storage with UW alone, the results were similar to the previous ones.        Conclusions: This data indicates that the TLM can improve islet yield and increase the opportunities of human pancreatic islet transplantation. Therefore, the TLM should be recommended for preserving human pancreas prior to islet isolation.},

abstract={The bond activation chemistry of B(C6F5)(3) and related electron-deficient boranes is currently experiencing a renaissance due to the fascinating development of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). B(C6F5)(3)'s ability to catalytically activate Si-H bonds through eta(1) coordination opened the door to several unique reduction processes. The ground-breaking finding that the same family of fully or partially fluorinated boron Lewis acids allows for the related H-H bond activation, either alone or as a component of an FLP, brought considerable momentum into the area of transition-metal-free hydrogenation and, likewise, hydrosilylation. This review comprehensively summarises synthetic methods involving borane-catalysed Si-H and H-H bond activation. Systems corresponding to an FLP-type situation are not covered. Aside from the broad manifold of C=X bond reductions and C=X/C-X defunctionalisations, dehydrogenative (oxidative) Si-H couplings are also included.},

However, this may not necessarily be true for other types of Li-based batteries. Indeed, next generation batteries, for example lithium-metal (Li-metal), lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2), and lithium-sulfur (Li-S), require a re-evaluation of Li-salts due to the different electrochemical and chemical reactions and conditions within such cells.

Methods of research synthesis commonly used in environmental health lag behind systematic review methods developed in the clinical sciences over the past 20 years.        OBJECTIVES: We sought to develop a proof of concept of the "Navigation Guide," a systematic and transparent method of research synthesis in environmental health.        DISCUSSION: The Navigation Guide methodology builds on best practices in research synthesis in evidence-based medicine and environmental health. Key points of departure from current methods of expert-based narrative review prevalent in environmental health include a prespecified protocol, standardized and transparent documentation including expert judgment, a comprehensive search strategy, assessment of "risk of bias," and separation of the science from values and preferences. Key points of departure from evidence-based medicine include assigning a "moderate" quality rating to human observational studies and combining diverse evidence streams.        CONCLUSIONS: The Navigation Guide methodology is a systematic and rigorous approach to research synthesis that has been developed to reduce bias and maximize transparency in the evaluation of environmental health information. Although novel aspects of the method will require further development and validation, our findings demonstrated that improved methods of research synthesis under development at the National Toxicology Program and under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are fully achievable. The institutionalization of robust methods of systematic and transparent review would provide a concrete mechanism for linking science to timely action to prevent harm.},

abstract={Traces of prebiotic amino acids, i.e., the building blocks of proteins, are excellent biomarkers that could provide evidence of extinct or extant life in extra-terrestrial environments. In particular, characterization of the enantiomeric excess of amino acids gives relevant information about the biotic or abiotic origin of molecules, because it is generally assumed that life elsewhere could be based on either l or d amino acids, but not both. The analytical procedures used in in-situ space missions for chiral discrimination of amino acids must meet severe requirements imposed by flight conditions: short analysis time, low energy consumption, robustness, storage for long periods under extreme conditions, high efficiency and sensitivity, automation, and remote-control operation. Such methods are based on gas chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography, and capillary electrophoresis, usually coupled with mass spectrometry; of these, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is the only such combination yet used in space missions. Preliminary in-situ sample derivatization is required before GC-MS analysis to convert amino acids into volatile and thermally stable compounds. The silylation reagent most commonly used, N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide, is unsuitable for detection of homochirality, and alternative derivatization techniques have been developed that preserve the stereochemical configuration of the original compounds and are compatible with spaceflight conditions. These include the reagent N,N-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal, which has already been used in the Rosetta mission, a mixture of alkyl chloroformate, ethanol, and pyridine, a mixture of perfluorinated anhydrides and perfluoro alcohols, and hexafluoroacetone, the first gaseous derivatizing agent. In all the space instruments, solvent extraction of organic matter and chemical derivatization have been combined in a single automatic and remote-controlled procedure in a chemical reactor. Liquid-based separation systems have been used in space missions. In particular, microchip capillary electrophoresis, based on microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems, enables high-performance chemical analysis of amino acids with low mass and volume equipment and low power and reagent consumption. Coupling with laser-induced fluorescence detectors results in ultra-low limits of detection. This critical review describes applications of the on-board instruments used in the Rosetta mission to comets and in the more recent Mars exploration program, i.e., the Mars Science Laboratory and ExoMars missions.},

abstract={H-1 NMR-based metabolomics was used to measure the response of Eisenia fetida earthworms after exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in soil. Earthworms were exposed to a range of PFOS concentrations (five, 10, 25, 50, 100 or 150 mg/kg) for two, seven and fourteen days. Earthworm tissues were extracted and analyzed by H-1 NMR. Multivariate statistical analysis of the metabolic response of E. fetida to PFOS exposure identified time-dependent responses that were comprised of two separate modes of action: a non-polar narcosis type mechanism after two days of exposure and increased fatty acid oxidation after seven and fourteen days of exposure. Univariate statistical analysis revealed that 2-hexyl-5-ethyl-3-furansulfonate (HEFS), betaine, leucine, arginine, glutamate, maltose and ATP are potential indicators of PFOS exposure, as the concentrations of these metabolites fluctuated significantly. Overall, NMR-based metabolomic analysis suggests elevated fatty acid oxidation, disruption in energy metabolism and biological membrane structure and a possible interruption of ATP synthesis. These conclusions obtained from analysis of the metabolic profile in response to sub-lethal PFOS exposure indicates that NMR-based metabolomics is an excellent discovery tool when the mode of action (MOA) of contaminants is not clearly defined.},

abstract={Novel phosphonic acid-functionalized fluorene derivatives 9, 9-bis (3'-phosphonic acid propyl)-2, 7-diphenylfluorene and 2,7-diphenylfluorene-9-ylphosphonic acid, synthesized by Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction, were evaluated as a chemoselective Fe3+ ion sensor. Through the disappearance of the characteristic sorption peak of P=O, P-OH and the form of new broad band (P-OFe stretching bands) in FT-IR spectra, it was verified that the Fe3+ ion cause the quenching of their fluorescence emission, due to the Fe3+ ion binding to them via the O-atoms of the phosphonic group. UV-vis analyses also gave evidences by the change of absorption peak of them. A linear relationship that flowed with the Perrin model of static quenching was observed between the relative fluorescence intensity (In F-0/F) of BPPDPF and the concentration of iron(III) in the range of 1-8 mu M with a detection limit of 0.02 mu M, so was with DPFPA in the range of 1-5 mu M with a detection limit of 0.01 mu M. Selectivity of them for Fe3+ was demonstrated over other metal ions by photoluminescence analysis in DMF-H2O solution. It showed that the other studied metal ions do not affect the determination of iron. We successfully monitored trace levels of iron (III) in tap water samples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Context: Acylcarnitines are biomarkers of incomplete beta-oxidation and mitochondrial lipid overload but indicate also high rates of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. It is unknown whether the production of acylcarnitines in primary human myotubes obtained from lean, metabolically healthy subjects reflects the fat oxidation in vivo.        Objective: Our objective was to quantify the acylcarnitine production in myotubes obtained from subjects with low and high fasting respiratory quotient (RQ).        Methods: Fasting RQ was determined by indirect calorimetry. Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were taken from 6 subjects with low fasting RQ (mean 0.79 +/- 0.03) and 6 with high fasting RQ (0.90 +/- 0.03), and satellite cells were isolated, cultured, and differentiated to myotubes. Myotubes were cultivated with 125 mu(MC)-C-13-labeled palmitate for 30 minutes and 4 and 24 hours. Quantitative profiling of 42 intracellular and 31 extracellular acylcarnitines was performed by stable isotope dilution-based metabolomics analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.        Results: Myotubes from donors with high fasting RQ produced and released significant higher amounts of medium-chain acylcarnitines. High (13)C8 and (13)C10 acylcarnitine levels in the extracellular compartment correlated with high fasting RQ. The decreased expression of medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) in these myotubes can explain the higher rate of incomplete fatty acid oxidation. A lower intracellular [C-13] acetylcarnitine to carnitine and lower intracellular (13)C16/(13)C18 acylcarnitine to carnitine ratio indicate reduced fatty acid oxidation capacity in these myotubes. Mitochondrial DNA content was not different.        Conclusion: Acylcarnitine production and release from primary human myotubes of donors with high fasting RQ indicate a reduced fatty acid oxidation capacity and a higher rate of incomplete fatty acid oxidation. Thus, quantitative profiling of acylcarnitine production in human myotubes can be a suitable tool to identify muscular determinants of fat oxidation in vivo.},

abstract={Chemical tracers have been used in various C capture and storage (CCS) projects worldwide primarily to provide information regarding subsurface migration of CO2 and to verify CO2 containment. Understanding the movement and interactions of CO2 in the subsurface is a challenging task considering the variety of states in which it exists (i.e. gas, liquid, supercritical, dissolved in water) and the range of possible storage mechanisms (i.e. residual or capillary trapping, dissolved in water, structural trapping or incorporation into minerals). This paper critically reviews several chemical tracer applications and case studies for CCS projects. In many instances, there are parallels (e. g. tracer classes and applications) between tracers in the oil and gas industry and in CCS. It has been shown that chemical tracers can complement geophysical measurements (e. g. seismic) in understanding the formation behaviour of CO2. Although tracers have been successfully used in many CCS projects, some fundamental information, for example partitioning and adsorption, about the behaviour of tracers is still lacking and this can be an issue when interpreting tracer data (e. g. determining leakage rates). In this paper the deployment and recovery of chemical tracers and their use on various CCS projects are described. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Substantial population exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, combined with available biomarkers and public concern, has resulted in an explosion of human health effects research. At the same time, remarkable shifts in the regulations governing the composition of some consumer products that contain endocrine disruptors (EDs) has occurred. However, important questions remain as to the weight of evidence linking EDs to human health end points. In this review, we critically examine the literature linking ED exposures to child neurodevelopment, focusing in particular on two model exposures to demonstrate issues related to bioaccumulative [e. g., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)] and rapidly metabolized (e. g., phthalates) compounds, respectively. Issues of study design, confounding, and exposure measurement are considered. Given widespread exposure to these compounds, the potential public health consequences of even small effects on human health are substantial. Therefore, advancing our understanding of any impact calls for careful attention to the principles of causal inference.},

abstract={In this feature article, we review and examine evidence that the primary photoexcited species in conjugated polymers is considerably delocalized. Localization occurs via a series of complex relaxation mechanisms on the <200 femtosecond time scale. We show that short-lived delocalization in the neutral excited state and charge separated state of bulk heterojunction blends might play an essential role in ensuring efficient formation of free charge carriers for photovoltaic applications. Finally, the additional parameter of intramolecular charge transfer character in the excited state of more recently developed donor-acceptor copolymers is discussed. Both delocalization and partial charge transfer reduce the binding of the electron and hole in photoexcited organic semiconductors and can help to overcome the bottleneck to macroscopic current generation in polymer solar cells.},

abstract={The occurrence of disinfection by-products (DBPs), especially trihalomethanes (THMs) in chlorinated drinking water has been well documented. Due to their adverse health effects, especially carcinogenicity, THMs have been regulated in drinking water by the American Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Union (EU). In order to minimize their formation, chloramination has been applied in water treatment plants, leading to lower concentrations of THMs, but resulting in formation of N-nitrosamines, including N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a probable human carcinogen. Nitrosamines, mainly NDMA, are mutagenic compounds and are suspected to be carcinogenic towards humans. In 2002, Mitch and Sedlak as well as Choi and Valentine reported that NDMA is formed during disinfection of dimethylamine (DMA) containing water or treated wastewater with chloramines. Moreover in 2007 Andrzejewski and Nawrocki reported that not only chloramination but also other oxidants (particularly ozone and chlorine dioxide) applied in water/wastewater treatment leads to formation of NDMA, when dimethylamine is present in raw water. Currently, according to the results of many experiments, formation of NDMA during reactions of strong oxidants, particularly chloramines, with waters containing DMA seems to be proved. US EPA has classified NDMA into the group B2 i.e. compounds which are probably carcinogenic to humans. In 2008 the WHO placed NDMA on the list of DBPs related to application of chloramines in water/wastewater treatment. The precursors of DBPs have been the focus of recent research, in order to understand the mechanisms involved in their formation, in an effort to minimize it. Natural Organic Matter (NOM) components in raw water act as precursors for the formation of both THMs and NDMA. In addition, anthropogenic emerging pollutants (e.g. pharmaceuticals, herbicides), have been shown to result in THMs and NDMA formation, during chlorination or chloramination. Emerging pollutants are increasingly detected in raw water and they cannot be effectively removed with conventional treatment, creating concern for the water quality, in regard to the formation of THMs and NDMA. The aim of this paper is the presentation and critical review of recent findings in the sector of THMs and NDMA precursors research in raw water, in particular NOM, pharmaceuticals and herbicides. Relevant studies are reviewed, with emphasis on the formation mechanisms, the compounds that can act as DBP precursors, and the levels of THMs and NDMA detected in disinfected waters. Finally, applications and proposals for minimization of precursors' occurrence and THMs and N DMA formation are compared and discussed in the light of the current scientific knowledge.},

abstract={Collecting bird eggs is an established method of biomonitoring for specific pollution hazards. One of the most critical problems with this method is the extreme biological variability in bird eggs, but standardizing the collection and preservation of eggs can reduce these problems. Furthermore, standard practices are required so that the results can be compared among studies because mistakes cannot be corrected by laboratory analysis. Therefore, a standard procedure for collecting and preserving bird eggs may be necessary. The objective of this review is to investigate the current standard of quality assurance in the field by analyzing 86 peer-reviewed papers describing egg collection and use for aquatic birds. We show that little attention has been paid to standardizing how eggs are collected and stored in the field. Important information is often absent, including crucial aspects of sample collection and preservation, such as the freshness of the eggs, the position of the eggs in the laying sequence, the selection criteria, random sampling, and the duration and temperature of transport. Potential standards are suggested and discussed as a foundation for the development of quality assurance standards in the field.},

abstract={Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are synthetic chlorinated hydrocarbons that have extensively polluted the environment and bioaccumulated in the food chain. PCBs have been deemed to be probable carcinogens by the Environmental Protection Agency, and exposure to high levels of PCBs has been consistently linked to increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In the present article we present a forensic epidemiologic evaluation of the causal relationship between NHL and elevated PCB levels via application of the Bradford-Hill criteria. Included in the evaluation is a meta-analysis of the results of previously published case-control studies in order to assess the strength of association between NHL and PCBs, resulting in an odds ratio in which the lowest percentile PCB concentration (quartile, quintile, or tertile) has been compared with the highest percentile concentration in the study groups. The weight-adjusted odds ratio for all PCB congeners was 1.43 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.31 to 1.55, indicating a statistically significant causal association with NHL. Because of the lack of an unexposed comparison group, a rationale for the use of a less than 2.0 relative risk causal contribution threshold is presented herein, including an ecologic analysis of NHL incidence and PCB accumulation (as measured by sales volume) over time. The overall results presented here indicate a strong general causal association between NHL and PCB exposure.},

abstract={Spectroelectrochemistry provides improved selectivity for sensors by electrochemically modulating the optical signal associated with the analyte. The sensor consists of an optically transparent electrode (OTE) coated with a film that preconcentrates the target analyte. The OTE functions as an optical waveguide for attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectroscopy, which detects the analyte by absorption. Alternatively, the OTE can serve as the excitation light for fluorescence detection, which is generally more sensitive than absorption. The analyte partitions into the film, undergoes an electrochemical redox reaction at the OTE surface, and absorbs or emits light in its oxidized or reduced state. The change in the optical response associated with electrochemical oxidation or reduction at the OTE is used to quantify the analyte. Absorption sensors for metal ion complexes such as [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) and [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) and fluorescence sensors for [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 1-hydroxypyrene have been developed. The sensor concept has been extended to binding assays for a protein using avidin-biotin and 17 beta-estradiol-anti-estradiol antibodies. The sensor has been demonstrated to measure metal complexes in complex samples such as nuclear waste and natural water. This sensor has qualities needed for security and defense applications that require a high level of selectivity and good detection limits for target analytes in complex samples. Quickly monitoring and designating intent of a nuclear program by measuring the Ru/Tc fission product ratio is such an application.},

They are proposed as an interesting alternative to conventional sensing materials with metal ion centers such as phthalocyanines or porphyrins. Besides, they are considered an appealing platform to study metal effects on analyte sorption and sensor performance due to a high variety in possible metal centers. In this work, the sensing properties are explored with the quartz crystal microbalance on the basis of a set of vic-dioximes complexes varied in their metal ion centers (Ni(2+), Pd(2+), Cu(2+), Co(2+)) and substituents (alkyl chain lengths from C(3)H(7) up to C(7)H(15)) and twelve selected analytes. Depending on the metal center and substituents widely diverging selectivity patterns were observed indicating preferences for alcohols, amines, and aromatic compounds. The results presented in this work show that the proposed metal complexes of vic-dioximes are excellent sensing materials and very promising for the use in chemical gas sensor array applications.

abstract={The goal of this article is to summarize new biological monitoring information on perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in aquatic ecosystems (post-2005) as a followup to our critical review published in 2006. A wider range of geographical locations (e.g., South America, Russia, Antarctica) and habitats (e.g., high-mountain lakes, deep-ocean, and offshore waters) have been investigated in recent years enabling a better understanding of the global distribution of PFCs in aquatic organisms. High concentrations of PFCs continue to be detected in invertebrates, fish, reptiles, and marine mammals worldwide. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is still the predominant PFC detected (mean concentrations up to 1900 ng/g ww) in addition to important concentrations of long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs; sum PFCAs up to 400 ng/g ww). More studies have evaluated the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of these compounds in both freshwater and marine food webs. Several reports have indicated a decrease in PFOS levels over time in contrast to PFCA concentrations that have tended to increase in tissues of aquatic organisms at many locations. The detection of precursor metabolites and isomers has become more frequently reported in environmental assessments yielding important information on the sources and distribution of these contaminants. The integration of environmental/ecological characteristics (e.g., latitude/longitude, salinity, and/or trophic status at sampling locations) and biological variables (e.g., age, gender, life cycle, migration, diet composition, growth rate, food chain length, metabolism, and elimination) are essential elements in order to adequately study the environmental fate and distribution of PFCs and should be more frequently considered in study design.},

Data Sources: PubMed search from 1970 to 2009 using the key words stapedotomy or stapedectomy or otosclerosis or stapesplasty.        Study Selection: Inclusion criteria to select articles and patient groups for meta-analysis and statistical analyses were as follows: otosclerosis as diagnosis, clear description of technique and prosthesis size, calibrated stapedotomy, and complete report of functional results.        Data Extraction: Five controlled studies were found analyzing the influence of prosthesis diameter and reporting the results in a comparable way for meta-analysis (n = 590). Sixty-two studies not analyzing the influence of prosthesis diameter contained comparable subgroups with a total of 9,536 cases. These cases were pooled according to their diameter (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.8 mm). The results of air conduction, bone conduction, air-bone gap (ABG), and success rate (closure of the ABG within 10 dB as percentage of the total cases) for all groups and frequency-specific ABG results were gathered. Furthermore, 12 clinical and experimental studies were reviewed that did not contribute to the statistical analysis.        Data Synthesis: A meta-analysis performed for success rate of the 5 controlled studies showed favorable results for 0.6-mm over 0.4-mm prostheses (success rate, 67% versus 58%, p = 0.05). In the statistical analysis of the pooled data, the 0.6-mm prosthesis showed better results compared with 0.4 mm (p G 0.001) in the postoperative air conduction threshold (29 dB versus 35 dB), postoperative ABG (7 dB versus 11 dB), ABG improvement (25 dB versus 21 dB), and success rate (81.1% versus 75.1%). The frequency-specific analysis of the postoperative ABG showed no advantage for the small prosthesis in the high frequencies. There was no difference in postoperative change of bone conduction in the 0.6- and 0.4-mm groups. Statistically significant results could not be assessed for other prosthesis diameters because of the small number of cases reported.        Conclusion: A 0.6-mm diameter piston prosthesis is associated with significantly better results than a 0.4-mm prosthesis and should be used if the surgical conditions allow it.},

The objective of this study was to compile the evidence for or against any difference in human islet yield and viability between these two. PubMed (January 2000 to May 2008) and Cochran Library searches were performed and 17 studies were included for the meta-analysis. Data on donor characteristics, preservation time, and outcomes were abstracted. Studies were subgrouped based on how TLM was used (UW + TLM or TLM alone), on mean cold ischemic time (CIT) (>20 h or <20 h), and on whether special chemical was used (yes or no). Meta-analysis of all studies and subgroups was performed and the pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were. reported. Overall, the use of TLM significantly increased islet yield [SMD, 0.74 (0.44-1.04)] and viability [SMD, 0.63 (0.14-1.12)]. The beneficial effects of TLM on islet yield were more evident when TLM was used following UW storage or when prolonged CIT was used. TLM used alone, shorter CIT, and no chemical use all resulted in similar islet viability between TLM and UW groups. Beneficial effects of TLM on islet viability were demonstrated only when TLM was used following UW storage, or with prolonged CIT, or with chemical use. In conclusion, the TLM was beneficial for prolonged pancreas preservation before human islet isolation; however, benefit of the TLM for short-term preservation was not clear.},

abstract={This critical review presents a discussion on the major advances in the field of organic-inorganic hybrid membranes for fuel cells application. The hybrid organic-inorganic approach, when the organic part is not conductive, reproduces to some extent the behavior of Nafion where discrete hydrophilic and hydrophilic domains are homogeneously distributed. A large variety of proton conducting or non conducting polymers can be combined with various functionalized, inorganic mesostructured particles or an inorganic network in order to achieve high proton conductivity, and good mechanical and chemical properties. The tuning of the interface between these two components and the control over chemical and processing conditions are the key parameters in fabricating these hybrid organic-inorganic membranes with a high degree of reproducibility. This dynamic coupling between chemistry and processing requires the extensive use and development of complementary ex situ measurements with in situ characterization techniques, following in real time the molecular precursor solutions to the formation of the final hybrid organic-inorganic membranes. These membranes combine the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of both the inorganic and organic components. The development of the sol-gel chemistry allows a fine tuning of the inorganic network, which exhibits acid-based functionalized pores (-SO3H, -PO3H2, -COOH), tunable pore size and connectivity, high surface area and accessibility. As such, these hybrid membranes containing inorganic materials are a promising family for controlling conductivity, mechanical and chemical properties (349 references).},

The molecular design of desired polymeric electroluminescent materials is the key in the PLED development. In this review, we systematically summarize the basic methods and theories of molecular design of PLED materials, from the single molecule to the aggregated states, primarily based on our previous studies. In the single molecule design, various methods and theories are introduced and discussed in detail. While in the aggregated state design, brief discussions are presented due to the complexity and rapid development of this aspect. Finally, a general method for the molecular design of PLED materials is suggested on the expectation of their future developments.},

abstract={This review article provides a critical overview of several different synthetic approaches developed for asymmetric preparation of fluorine-containing amines, amino alcohols, alpha- and beta-amino acids. The common feature of these methods is the application of sulfinyl group as a chiral auxiliary to control the stereochemical outcome of the reactions under study. In particular, the following general methods are critically discussed: diastereoselective methylene transfer from diazomethane to the carbonyl of beta-keto-gamma-fluoroalkyl sulfoxides as a general approach for preparation of various alpha-fluoroalkyl alpha-sulfinylalkyl oxiranes. The resulting compounds were used as true chiral synthons for their further elaboration via oxidative or reductive desulfurization, to numerous fluorine-containing and biologically relevant amino- and hydroxy-containing derivatives. Another general approaches discussed here are asymmetric additions to C=N double bond. One of them is addition of chiral sulfoxide stabilized carbon nucleophiles to fluorine-containing imines, leading to convenient preparation of alpha-fluoroalkyl derivatives of alpha amino acids and amines. Another approach is asymmetric Reformatsky reaction between N-sulfinyl imines and ethyl bromodifluoroacetate allowing operationally convenient preparation of alpha,alpha-difluoro-beta-amino acids in enantiomerically pure form. Finally, structurally similar but mechanistically different addition reactions of diethyl difluoromethylphosphonate to N-sulfinyl imines, as a general approach to asymmetric synthesis of alpha,alpha-difluoro-beta-aminophosphonates and phosphonic acids, are discussed. Effect of fluorine on the mechanism and stereochemical outcome of these reactions is discussed in detail and compared, where it is possible, with that of the analogous reactions of fluorine-free substrates.

abstract={Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE209) is the primary component in a commonly used flame retardant. Previous studies had proved that BDE209 itself was not toxic, while its metabolites including debrominated diphenyl ethers (De-BDEs) and methoxylated brominated diphenyl ethers (MeO-BDEs) posed a potential threat to organisms. Many studies had indicated that BDE209 could metabolize quickly in mammals, but lacking in the basic data about the metabolism of BDE209 in fish. In the present study, two replicate treatment groups of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to BDE209 via a single intraperitoneal injection approximately 100 and 500 ng/g, respectively. Muscle, liver and blood samples were collected to analyze the specific metabolites on day 1 and day 28 post injection. The highest concentration of BDE209 was detected in muscle tissues, from 796.1 ng/g wet weight (day 1) to 687.1 ng/g wet weight (day 28) in high dose group, suggesting that BDE209 could accumulate slightly in muscle tissues. However, BDE209 was not detected in the blood for all treatments. Most congeners of De-BDEs were found in muscle and liver tissues, with the highest concentration in the liver. The main De-BDEs were nona-, octa-, hepta- and penta-De-BDEs. A total of seven MeO-BDE metabolites were observed among different fish tissues. Blood had the highest contribution of the MeO-BDE metabolites. Each MeO-BDE congener increased over the 28 days. These results in contrast to other studies suggested possible species-specific differences in metabolic abilities.},

abstract={Peroxisome proliferator chemicals (PPC) are thought to mediate their effects in rodents on hepatocyte growth and liver cancer through the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha. Recent studies indicate that the plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) increased the incidence of liver tumors in PPAR alpha-null mice. We hypothesized that some PPC, including DEHP, induce transcriptional changes independent of PPAR alpha but dependent on other nuclear receptors, including the constitutive-activated receptor (CAR) that mediates phenobarbital (PB) effects on hepatocyte growth and liver tumor induction. To determine the potential role of CAR in mediating effects of PPC, a meta-analysis was performed on transcript profiles from published studies in which rats and mice were exposed to PPC and compared the profiles to those produced by exposure to PB. Valproic acid, clofibrate, and DEHP in rat liver and DEHP in mouse liver induced genes, including Cyp2b family members that are known to be regulated by CAR. Examination of transcript changes by Affymetrix ST 1.0 arrays and reverse transcription-PCR in the livers of DEHP-treated wild-type, PPAR alpha-null, and CAR-null mice demonstrated that (1) most (similar to 94%) of the transcriptional changes induced by DEHP were PPAR alpha-dependent, (2) many PPAR alpha-independent genes overlapped with those regulated by PB, (3) induction of genes Cyp2b10, Cyp3a11, and metallothionine-1 by DEHP was CAR dependent but PPAR alpha-independent, and (4) induction of a number of genes (Cyp8b1, Gstm4, and Gstm7) was independent of both CAR and PPAR alpha. Our results indicate that exposure to PPAR alpha activators including DEHP leads to activation of multiple nuclear receptors in the rodent liver.},

abstract={The Korean government strengthened the environmental polices to manage and enhance Metropolitan Area air quality, and also has enforced "Special Act on Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement (SASMAQI)" issued in Dec. 2004. Recently government expanded the Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD) to the outskirts satellite cities of Seoul area through the "Revised Law Draft of SASMAQI". The SMAQMD has been alloted the allowable emission loads to the local governments on the basis of the carrying PM10 capacity. However, in order to establish the effective air quality control strategy for PM10, it is necessary to understand the corresponding sources which have a potential to directly impact ambient PM10 concentration. To deal with the situations, many receptor methodologies have been developed to identify the origins of pollutants and to determine the contributions of sources of interests.        The objective of this study was to extensively identify PM10 sources and to estimate their contributions at the metropolitan area. PM10 samples were simultaneously collected at the 3 semi -industrialized local cities in the Seoul metropolitan area such as Hwasung-si, Paju-si, and Icheon-si sites from April 15 to May 31, 2007. The samples collected on the teflon membrane filter by one PM10 cyclone sampler were analyzed for trace metals and soluble ions and samples on the quartz fiber filter by another sampler were analyzed for OC and EC. Source apportionment study was then performed by using a positive matrix factorization (PMF) receptor model. A total of 6 sources were identified and their contributions were estimated in each monitoring site. Contribution results on Hwasung, Paju, and Icheon sites were as follows: 33%, 27%, and 27% from soil source, 26%, 26%, and 21% from secondary aerosol source, 11%, 11%, and 12% from biomass burning, 12%, 6%, and 5% from sea salt, 7%, 15%, and 19% from industrial related source, and finally 11%, 15%, and 16% from mobile and oil complex source, respectively. This study provides information on the major sources affecting air quality in the receptor sites and thus it will help to manage the ambient air quality in the metropolitan area by establishing reasonable control strategies, especially for the anthropogenic emission sources.},

abstract={Obesity and obesity-related disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, are epidemic in Western countries, particularly the United States. The conventional wisdom holds that obesity is primarily the result of a positive energy balance, i.e. too many calories in and too few calories burned. Although it is self-evident that fat cannot be accumulated without a higher caloric intake than expenditure, recent research in a number of laboratories suggests the existence of chemicals that alter regulation of energy balance to favor weight gain and obesity. These obesogens derail the homeostatic mechanisms important for weight control, such that exposed individuals are predisposed to weight gain, despite normal diet and exercise. This review considers the evidence for obesogens, how they might act, and where future research is needed to clarify their relative contribution to the obesity epidemic.

Mixtures of known and unknown pollutants can cause toxic effects in the environment. Besides deploying a chemicals-driven strategy for the ecological risk assessment of the pollutants, it is necessary to apply and to explore biological strategies. Consequently, bioassays, biosensors and effect-directed analysis (EDA) to identify pollutants responsible of particular effects have become increasingly important.        We give a broad overview of how to assess biological monitoring of ecosystems and chemical monitoring of priority and specific substances involved in environmental contamination. We describe bioanalytical tools and address the need to integrate and to combine them with chemical tools. We also describe the requirement for EDA in field monitoring and risk assessment of pollutants.        We critically review the literature and present generalized strategies for characterizing environmental contamination, and detecting and categorizing toxicological problems.

abstract={Perfluorinated acids, including perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs),and perfluorinated sulfonates(PFASs), are environmentally persistent and have been detected in a variety of wildlife across the globe. The most commonly detected PFAS, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), has been classified as a persistent and bioaccumulative substance. Similarities in chemical structure and environmental behavior of PFOS and the PFCAs that have been detected in wildlife have generated concerns about the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs. Differences between partitioning behavior of perfluorinated acids and persistent lipophilic compounds complicate the understanding of PFCA bioaccumulation and the subsequent classification of the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs according to existing regulatory criteria. Based on available research on the bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids, five key points are highlighted in this review: (1) bioconcentration and bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids are directly related to the length of each compound's fluorinated carbon chain; (2) PFASs are more bioaccumulative than PFCAs of the same fluorinated carbon chain length; (3) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (perfluorooctanoate (PFO) and shorter PFCAs) are not considered bioaccumulative according to the range of promulgated bioaccumulation,"B", regulatory criteria of 1000-5000 L/kg; (4) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less have low biomagnification potential in food webs, and (5) more research is necessary to fully characterize the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains (>7 fluorinated carbons), as PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains may exhibit partitioning behavior similar to or greater than PFOS. The bioaccumulation potential of perfluorinated acids with seven fluorinated carbons or less appears to be several orders of magnitude lower than "legacy" persistent lipophilic compounds classified as bioaccumulative. Thus, although many PFCAs are environmentally persistent and can be present at detectable concentrations in wildlife, it is clear that PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (including PFO) are not bioaccumulative according to regulatory criteria.},

abstract={Aluminum is associated with neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer by some authors. Although this has never been confirmed, there is evidence of an accumulation in kidneys of people with renal problems. This present work was carried out to address this subject by evaluating the occurrence of significant aluminum migration from cooking utensils during food preparation. Eight types of food cooked in different ways and three distinct types of pans (a saucepan, pressure cooker and frying pan), with and without teflon coating, were evaluated. The metal analysis was conducted in an Optical Emission Spectrometer with Inductively Coupled Plasma. The results showed insignificant transference of aluminum in some food products. The main transference occurred when tomato sauce was prepared, which has a low pH, in the pan without teflon coating. The menu prepared with all the foods for two meals in a day showed that the aluminum mass incorporated by the food corresponded to 2% of the daily consumption limit of aluminum for a 60 kg person (1 mg.kg(-1) of body weight per day). Thus, the use of aluminum pans in food cooking practically does not interfere in the total consumption of aluminum allowed for people.},

Reaction of lanthanoid elements and Hg(C6F5)(2) with the still bulkier DippFormH in THF resulted in C-F activation and formation of [Ln(DippForm)(2)F(thf)] (Ln=La, Ce, Nd, Sm and Tm) complexes, and o-HC6F4O(CH2)(4)DippForm in which the formamidine is functionalised by a ring-opened THF that has trapped tetrafluorobenzyne. Analogous reactions between Ln metals, Hg(o-HC6F4)(2) and DippFormH yielded [Ln(Dipfform)(2)F(thf)] (Ln=La, Sm and Nd) and 3,4,5-F3C6H2O(CH2),DippForm. X-ray crystal structures of the heteroleptic fluorides show six-coordinate monomers with two chelating DippForm ligands and cisoid fluoride and THF ligands in a trigonal prismatic array. The organometallic species [Ln(DippForm)(2)(C  CPh)(thf)] (Ln = Nd or Sm) are obtained from reaction of Nd metal, bis(phenylethynyl)mercury (Hg(C  CPh)(2)) and DippFormH, and the oxidation of [Sm(DippForm)2(thf),] with Hg(C  CPh)(2), respectively The monomeric, six-coordinate, cisoid [Ln(DippForm)(2)(C  CPh)(thf)] complexes have trigonal prismatic geometries and rare (for Ln) terminal (C  CPh groups with contrasting Ln-C  C angles (Ln= Nd, 170.9(4)degrees; Ln=Sm, 142.9(7)degrees). Their formation lends support to the view that [Ln(DippForm)(2)F(thf)] complexes arise from oxidative formation and C-F activation of [Ln(DippForm)(2)(C6F5)] intermediates.},

Data acquired by TANSO-FTS (Fourier Transform Spectrometer) and TANSO-CAI (Cloud and Aerosol Imager) on GOSAT will be collected at Tsukuba Space Center at JAXA. The level I A and I B data of FTS (interferogram and spectra, respectively) and the level I A of CAI (uncorrected data) will be generated at JAXA and will be transferred to GOSAT Data Handling facility (DHF) at NIES for further processing. Radiometric and geometric correction will be applied to CAI L1A data to generate CAI L1B data. From CAI LIB data, cloud coverage and aerosol information (CAI Level 2 data) will be estimated. The FTS data that is recognized to have "low cloud coverage" by CAI will be processed to generate column amount of carbon dioxide CO2 and methane CH4 (FTS Level 2 data). Level 3 data will be "global map column amount" of green house gases averaged in time and space. Level 4 data will be global distribution of carbon source/sink model and re-calculated forward model estimated by inverse model. Major data flow will be also described. The Critical Design Review of the DHF was completed in the end of July of 2007 to prepare the scheduled launch of GOSAT in December 2008. The data products can be searched and will be open to the public through GOSAT DHF after the data validation process.},

abstract={Noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, and pi-pi stacking, are increasingly being utilized to develop well-ordered and self-organized supramolecular materials. Recently, new types of nonclassical weak interactions, such as C-H-...pi, C-(HF)-F-...-C, and C-(HO)-O-..., have been exploited in stabilizing the specific conformations of molecules and molecular assemblies in the solid state. These noncovalent interactions play an important role in materials comprised of polymer chains, because cooperative effects from a large number of weak interactions can lead to drastic changes in its conformation, several properties, and functionalities. The programmed design of synthetic helical polymer with well-defined molecular conformation has been the main subject in modern polymer science and engineering. Silicon-catenated polysilane is an ideal helical silicon quantum wire and polymers with unique photophysical properties. The present review highlights the spectroscopic evidences for through-space weak (SiF)-F-...-C interaction in poly(methyl-3,3,3-trifluoropropylsilane) (1) in noncoordinating and coordinating solvents by means of NMR (Si-29 and F-19) and IR spectroscopies, and viscometric measurement. It was found that 1 is applicable for chemosensors with an extremely high sensitivity and selectivity toward fluoride ions in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and with high sensitivity for nitroaromatic compounds, detected by a decrease in the photoluminescence intensity in THF and in thin solid film.

Reaction of 1 with 1 equiv of [Ph3C][BAr4F] or BAr3F (ArF) C6F5) in C6D5Br afforded the methyl cation [Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))Me](+) (6(+)), whereas with half an equivalent of [Ph3C][BAr4F] the fluxional methyl-bridged homo-binuclear cation [Ti-2((NBu)-Bu-t)(2)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))(2)Me-2(mu-Me)](+) (10(+)) was formed. Reaction of 1 with [Ph3C][BAr4F] in CD2Cl2 formed the monochloride cation [Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))Cl](+) (8(+)), which was also prepared from Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))Cl(Me) and [Ph3C][BAr4F]. Cation 8(+) reacted with pyridine to give the adduct [Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3)) Cl(py)]+ (9(+)) and with Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))Me-2 to form the chloride-bridged cation [Ti-2((NBu)-Bu-t)(2)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))(2)Me-2( mu-Cl)](+) (11(+)). Reaction of 2 with [Ph3C][BAr4F] gave [Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))(CH2SiMe3)](+) (7(+)), which is stabilized by beta-Si-C agostic interaction characterized by a high-field-shifted 29Si NMR resonance. Attempts to generate 7(+) by reaction of 2 with [PhNMe2H][BAr4F] in CH2Cl2 led to Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))Cl-2 and [PhNMe2(CH2Cl)][BAr4F] (12-BAr4F) via a series of solvent activation reactions, the details of which have been elucidated. Reaction of 6+ or 7+ with Ph3PO afforded the adducts [Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))R(Ph3PO)]+, whereas with pyridine a C-H bond activation reaction occurred to give [Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))(NC5H4)](+) (17(+)) and the corresponding alkane RH. Density functional theory calculations of the isolobal d(0) fragments [Ti(NR)(R'(3)[9]aneN(3))](2+) and [Cp2Ti](2+) found that their frontier orbitals, although broadly similar, featured important differences in their shapes and energies. These account for the absence of any alpha-C-H agostic interaction in 6+, whereas [ Cp2TiMe]+ is stabilized by a weak interaction of this type, as judged by DFT-computed geometries. The experimentally observed increase in Ti-Me group average (1)J(CH) on forming either 6(+) from 1 or [ Cp2TiMe]+ from Cp2TiMe2 is reproduced by DFT and attributed to intrinsic global changes in carbon 2s orbital contribution to the Ti-C and C-H bonds upon cation formation.        These changes were shown to mask the otherwise expected decrease in average(1)J(CH) for the R-agostic methyl in [Cp2TiMe](+). The difference between the Ti-Me (1)J(CH) values in 1 (111 Hz) and isolobal Cp2TiMe2 (124 Hz) was also attributed to differences in Ti center electrophilicity. The experimental high-field-shifted Si-29 NMR resonance in 7(+) was well reproduced in the DFT-computed beta-Si-C agostic structure, and upper and lower limits for the strength of the agostic interaction were estimated. An NBO analysis of the Ti-CH2SiMe3 bonding found several different contributions, including negative hyperconjugation (population of sigma*(Si-beta-C-gamma)) and formal C-alpha-Si-beta -> Ti and Si-beta-C-gamma -> Ti bond pair donation.},

abstract={A method of extraction-separation of Fe(II), Fe(III) and Cu(II) under pseudo three-phase equilibrium using a filter-paper phase separator with high speed stirring was examined. Under the optimum conditions, Cu(II) and Fe(III) were extracted into a dithizone-chloroform phase and an 8-quinolinol-chloroform phase, respectively, leaving Fe(II) in the water phase. Concentrated metal ions were analyzed quantitatively by means of an optical absorption spectrometer. At, low concentrations, the metal ions were back-extracted with 5M nitric acid solution from the organic phases, and analyzed quantitatively with an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). The results showed that it is possible to separate Fe(II) of not less than 1.5ppb, Fe(III) of not less than 1ppb and Cu(II) of not less than 1ppb from the mixture if this method is employed. When the rate of transport of the liquid from one flask to another was adjusted to be 2ml/min, 120 minutes were needed for this extraction-separation procedure, and according to this method, it was possible to determine the ratio of Fe(II) to Fe(III) in both tap water and well water. It is interesting to notice that Fe(II), which is easily oxidized by dissolved oxygen, co-exists in drinking water where the pH is 5-7. It was presumed that total organic carbon had some influence on this fact.},

abstract={The exchange kinetics of Cs+, Cu2+, and Eu3+ ions in Nafion-117 were measured at different HI ion concentrations in equilibrating salt solutions. The exchange kinetics were found to be independent of the H+ ion concentration in equilibrating salt solutions over the pH range of 5-2. The exchange kinetics were therefore used to evaluate self-diffusion coefficients of the metal ions using an analytical solution of Fick's second law. The self-diffusion coefficient of Cs+ in Nafion-117 was found to be in agreement with the value obtained in our earlier work (1.94 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1)) based on the isotopic-exchange method in the absence of HI ions. This further confirmed that the exchange process in the Nafion-117 membrane represents the pure isotopic exchange in the said pH range. The self-diffusion coefficients of Cu2+ and Eu3+ were found to be 2.9 x 10(-7) and 4.5 x 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1), respectively. The smaller self-diffusion coefficient of Eu3+ reflects its increased electrostatic interaction with the membrane matrix. The kinetics of forward (H-(m)(+) = M-(s)(n+)) and reverse (M-(m)(n+) = H-(s)(+)) exchanges of metal ions (Cs+, Cu2+, and Eu3+) in the Nafion-117 membrane were also studied. The Nernst-Planck theory was examined to predict the kinetics of these exchanges. The theory was found to be reasonably accurate for predicting the kinetics of the reverse ion exchange but completely failed for the forward ion exchange. Contrary to the prediction of the theory, the kinetics of forward exchanges of Cs+, Cu2+, and Eu3+ with H+ ions in the Nafion- 117 membrane were found to be independent of the metal ions. This shows that the self-diffusion coefficients of the counterions in Nafion- 117 can be obtained only from the analysis of reverse exchange kinetics based on the Nernst-Planck equation.},

Materials and Methods: A computer-aided and manual search for published studies investigating silicone microimplants therapy for stress urinary incontinence in adult women. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using criteria based on generally accepted principles of interventional research.        Results: Only two RCTs, only published as an abstract, were found. Eleven pre-experimental or observational studies were identified. Overall, the methodological quality was low. The main methodological shortcomings of the studies were: no random allocation procedure, lack of prestratification on prognostic determinants, no blinding, small sample sizes, and lack of proper analysis and presentation of results. There was variability in the indication for implantation, implantation procedure, rate and volume of silicone microimplants. The use of different. outcome measures in most of the trials made comparison between studies difficult.        Conclusions: Because of the low methodological quality of included studies, results should be interpreted with caution and no firm conclusions about the efficacy of silicone microimplants were possible. Randomized clinical trials, using valid and reliable subjective and objective measurements, are necessary to establish the efficacy of silicone microimplants therapy in treating stress urinary incontinence in adult women.

abstract={The role of tribochemical products in the friction and wear reduction of ceramics with different fractional ionic character in CF3CH2F (HFC-134a) gas was investigated using a ball-on-disk type tribometer. Without exposure to air, the wear tracks on the disks were characterized with the aid of a micro-spot X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscope (XPS) whose analytical chamber was connected to the friction chamber of the tribometer. Further, the adsorption and desorption behaviors of HFC-134a molecules on the nascent surfaces of the ceramics were studied using an adsorption test apparatus in high vacuum. It was found that the lubricating effect of HFC-134a gas was closely related to the fractional ionic or covalent characters of the ceramics. HFC-134a gas was more effective in lubricating ionic ceramics than the covalent ceramics. XPS analysis revealed that metal fluorides were mainly formed on the frictional surfaces of the ionic ceramics, whereas the composition of the tribochemical products on the frictional surfaces of the other ceramics was complicated. The adsorption tests proved that HFC-134a was decomposed to an olefin CF2 = CHF on the nascent surfaces of the ionic ceramic Al2O3 and the covalent ceramics. However, the formation of organic fluorine-containing compounds was not detected on the frictional surfaces of the ionic ceramics by XPS. This result implies that the mechanism of tribochemical reactions is strongly dependent on the bond type of ceramics. It is concluded that the low friction and wear of the ionic ceramics in HFC-134a gas result from the metal fluorides formed with high surface concentration on the sliding surfaces.},

Therefore, it has been possible to delineate a structure-function relationship for these fluorosurfactants with reference to their efficiency of water-in-carbon dioxide microemulsion formation. An important finding is that one of these surfactants, namely sodium bis(1H,1H-perfluoropentyl)-2-sulfosuccinate (di-CF4), is able to stabilize w/c microemulsions close to the bottle pressure of a normal CO2 cylinder. Such efficient surfactants of this kind have obvious advantages for potential practical applications of CO2.},

abstract={Techniques for Pb measurements have reached the stage where Antarctic ice with sub-picogram per gram concentrations can be reliably analysed for isotopic composition. Here, particular attention has been given to measuring the quantity of Pb added during the decontamination and sample storage stages of the sample preparation process because of their impact on accuracy at low concentrations. These stages, including the use of a stainless steel chisel for the decontamination, contributed similar to5.2 pg to the total sample analysed, amounting to a concentration increase of similar to13 fg g(-1), which is significantly less than expected. Consequently, the corrections to the isotopic ratios and concentration were also smaller. Other contributions to the blank, such as Pb fallout onto critical working areas in the HEPA-filtered air laboratories, were also relatively small as was the amount of Pb leached from preconditioned perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) beakers during sample processing. The ion source contributed typically 89 19 fg to the blank. Although this was relatively,large, its influence depended upon the amount of Pb available for analysis and it had the greatest impact when small volumes of samples with a very low concentration were analysed. A 15 months investigation of the leaching characteristics of Pb from a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) sample storage bottle showed 11 fg cm(-2) per day was released immediately following the initial 2 months cleaning process, but this decreased to immeasurable values after a further 3 months of cleaning.

We have therefore endeavored to employ liquid carbon dioxide as the organic phase in such extractions to eliminate the waste stream deriving from organic contamination of the aqueous phase. Whereas traditional metal-binding ligands dissolve in CO(2) at moderate pressures, the resulting complexes [(LH(+))(2)MCl(x)(2-)] exhibit negligible solubility in CO(2) at pressures up to 400 atm. Consequently, we have designed and synthesized a series of highly CO(2)-soluble analogues to the metal-binding ligands currently used by the PGM-refining industry. We have measured equilibrium efficiency factors for various ligands and ligands bound to platinum. We have found that the structure of the CO(2)-philic component of the ligand affects the binding constant and hence that fluoroalkyls are better extractants of platinum than fluoroethers. Finally, we have noted that the phase behavior of the ligand-metal complex is a function of both the ligand structure and the identity of the metal, opening the possibility for separations based on both pressure and ligand selectivity.},

abstract={It is now appreciated that the relationships of proteins, particularly enzymes, within a protein superfamily can be understood not only in terms of their sequence similarities and three-dimensional structures but also by chemical threads that relate their functional attributes. The mechanistic ties among superfamily members can often be traced to a common transition state for the rate-limiting step of the reactions being catalyzed. This paper presents an analysis of a metalloenzyme superfamily, the members of which catalyze a very diverse set of reactions with unrelated transition states but a more general common mechanistic imperative. The vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily is composed of structurally related proteins with paired beta alpha beta beta beta motifs that provide a metal coordination environment with two or three open or readily accessible coordination sites to promote direct electrophilic participation of the metal ion in catalysis. The known types of reactions that are catalyzed include isomerizations (glyoxalase I), epimerizations (methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase), oxidative cleavage of C-C bonds (extradiol dioxygenase), and nucleophilic substitutions (fosfomycin resistance proteins). The remarkable access to mechanism space that is provided by the VOC superfamily appears to derive from a simple, pseudosymmetric structural fold that maximizes the catalytic versatility of the metal center.},

abstract={This article reviews the epidemiologic studies of the association of ischemic heart disease risk and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure from a spouse who smokes. Seventeen studies (nine cohort, eight case-control) comprising more than 485,000 lifelong nonsmokers and 7,345 coronary heart disease (CHD) events were included in a meta-analysis. Together, these studies include 36% more CHD events and 58% more study subjects than were available for review by the U.S. Occupationai Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 1994. The relative risk (RR) for fatal or nonfatal coronary events among never smokers married to smokers, compared to those whose spouses did nor smoke, was RR = 1.25 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.17-1.33) across the combined studies. This association was statistically similar in men (RR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.15-1.32) and women (RR = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.15-1.32); in studies of cohort (RR = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.15-1.31) and case-control (RR = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.19-1.81) design; in the United Stales (RR = 1.22, 95% CI, 1.13-1.30) and other countries (RR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.21-1.65); and in studies of fatal (RR = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.14-1.30) and nonfatal (RR = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.04-1.67) heart disease. in three studies that presented data separately for nonsmokers married to current or former smokers, the association was stronger when the spouses continued to smoke (RR = 1.16, 1.06-1.28) than With former smokers (RR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89-1.08). The aggregate data are unlikely to be attributable to chance, publication bias, confounding, or misclassification of exposure. The evidence linking heart disease and FTS exposure from a spouse has become substantially stronger-since OSHA first proposed including heart disease in its risk assessment of ETS in 1994.},

abstract={Recently, evidence has accumulated that the extensive use of modern pesticides results in their presence in the atmosphere at many places throughout the world. In Europe over 80 current-use pesticides have been detected in rain and 30 in air. Similar observations have been made in North America. The compounds most often looked for and detected are the organochlorine insecticide lindane and triazine herbicides, especially atrazine. However, acetanilide and phenoxyacid herbicides, as well as organophosphorus insecticides have also frequently been found in rain and air. Concentrations in air normally range from a few pg/m(3) to many ng/m(3). Concentrations in rain generally range from a few ng/L to several mu g/L. In fog even higher concentrations are observed. Deposition varies between a few mg/ha/y and more than 1 g/ha/y per compound. However, these estimates are usually based on the collection and analysis of (bulk) precipitation and do not include dry particle deposition and gas exchange. Nevertheless, model calculations, analysis of plant tissue, and first attempts to measure dry deposition in a more representative way, all indicate that total atmospheric deposition probably does not normally exceed a few g/ha/y. So far, little attention has been paid to the presence of transformation products of modern pesticides in the atmosphere, with the exception of those of triazine herbicides, which have been looked for and found frequently.        Generally, current-use pesticides are only detected at elevated concentrations in air and rain during the application season. The less volatile and more persistent ones, such as lindane, but to some extent also triazines, are present in the atmosphere in low concentrations throughout the year. In agricultural areas, the presence of modern pesticides in the atmosphere can be explained by the crops grown and pesticides used on them. They are also found in the air and rain in areas where they are not used, sometimes even in remote places, just like their organochlorine predecessors. Concentrations and levels are generally much lower there. These data suggest that current-use pesticides can be transported through the atmosphere over distances of tens to hundreds, and sometimes even more than a thousand kilometres. The relative importance of these atmospheric inputs varies greatly. For mountainous areas and remote lakes and seas, the atmosphere may constitute the sole route of contamination by pesticides. In coastal waters, on the other hand, riverine inputs may prevail. To date, little is known about the ecological significance of these aerial inputs.},

abstract={The feasibility of various techniques for the separation and quantification of sediment and sediment porewaters for total Hg and methylmercury (MMHg)-centrifugation, sediment filtration, whole core squeezing, and dialysis membrane techniques (peepers)-were investigated in estuarine sediments. The concentration and distribution of iron, manganese, MMHg, and total Hg in porewaters were compared to ascertain which method provided the best technique for the collection of large volume porewater samples. Direct filtration techniques did not provide sufficient sample volume. Our studies confirmed the need to filter in an inert atmosphere. Processing in an inert atmosphere is also required for centrifugation. Centrifugation was the most difficult method, requiring extensive operator training and much attention to detail during sample processing. Core squeezing is a viable alternative but suffers from sample size problems and potential artifacts due to oxidation during processing. While peepers have advantages, the investigations here show that they need to be completely degassed before they provide reliable Hg speciation measurements, especially as they were constructed from Teflon, which can store significant amounts of oxygen. The need to deoxygenate the peepers compromises their use as a routine separation method for Hg. On the basis of the need for large volumes and the large number of samples to be collected, we concluded that centrifugation was the most reliable method for the determination of Hg and MMHg in estuarine porewaters.},

abstract={Anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) was used to determine lead in blood and blood fractions with the aid of separation techniques including ultrafiltration and gel permeation and affinity chromatographies, as well as to quantify the metal in whole blood and plasma. The ASV technique was employed in its differential pulse mode, using a mercury film electrode coated with the perfluorinated polymer Nafion in order to avoid adsorption of proteins and organic matter. In this way, limits of detections in the sub-nanogram-per-millilitre range were achieved. The acid pH provided by 0.5 M HCl causes the sample to hemolyse and release lead from its complexes, thus allowing the total lead content in blood to be measured.        Three blood samples from individuals not exposed to the metal were analysed; they were found to contain less than 160 ng Pb mL(-1), most be bound to red blood cells. In fact, about 94% was located within erythrocytes ( 70% bound to hemoglobin and the rest to compounds of low molecular weight). The remaining 6% was present in plasma (49% bound to albumin and 51% to proteins, aminoacids and substances of low molecular weight). The information obtained allows one to readily establish clinical toxicity patterns for lead in blood.},

abstract={Carcinogenic arylamines typically undergo metabolic activation via N-hydroxylation followed in most instances by O-esterification. In this study, the ability of methyl-, dimethyl-, and ethylaniline constituents of tobacco smoke to undergo oxidation at the nitrogen atom was analyzed. In addition, the mutagenicity of the corresponding N-hydroxyalkylanilines and the conformational properties of the DNA adducts generated from their N-acyloxy derivatives were investigated. All the arylamines underwent irreversible electrochemical N-oxidation at potentials higher than those observed for the oxidation of carcinogenic polynuclear aromatic amines. There were minor differences in the oxidation potentials, which were consistent with the position and electron-donating abilities of the alkyl substituents; however, the differences appeared to be too small to account for the range of genotoxic effects among the alkylanilines. N-Hydroxyarylamines containing p-alkyl substituents had increased mutagenicities in Salmonella typhimurium TA100, which was attributed to their higher efficiencies of adduct formation. Increased mutagenicities were also observed upon o-alkyl substitution; however, this property was not related to a greater ability of the ortho-substituted species to form DNA adducts, which suggested that adducts from ortho-substituted alkylanilines may be intrinsically more mutagenic than their meta- and para-substituted analogues. In all instances, N-(acyloxy)arylamines generated from the N-hydroxyarylamines reacted with dG, dG nucleotides, and DNA to yield C8-substituted dG derivatives as the major adducts. The alkylaniline-dG adducts displayed distinct conformational trends that were determined by the location of the alkyl substituents. Spectroscopic data indicated higher percentages of low-energy syn conformers in the adducts that contained alkyl groups ortho to the arylamine nitrogen as opposed to adducts not bearing ortho substituents. The data strongly suggest that the conformational properties of the DNA adducts, in particular their ability to adopt syn conformations, may be determinant factors for the genotoxic responses elicited by certain alkylanilines (e.g., 2-methylaniline and 2,6-dimethylaniline).},

abstract={The applications of mass spectrometry (MS) are increasing in environmental analysis, pesticides measurement in particular. To take full advantage of the capabilities of MS it is important to have available labeled standards that enhance the performance of the quantitative analysis, increasing its accuracy and precision. We synthesized a series of deuterated internal standards corresponding to fenamiphos (Ia) and some of its metabolites, using rapid procedures and inexpensive materials. The use of 3-fluoro-3-(heptafluoropropyl)-2-(nonafluorobutyl)-cis-oxaziridine (IV) was particularly attractive for the preparation of oxidative metabolites of fenamiphos (Ia), analytical and deuterated standards. We used these compounds for the analysis of these pollutants in water. We used solid-phase extraction, testing several materials, and supercritical fluid extraction techniques. The analysis was done by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, with the selected ion monitoring (SIM) technique, obtaining good results with the oxidative metabolites of compound Ia (compounds IIa and IIIa). For the more polar metabolites Ib, IIb and IIIb, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis in the SIM mode gave the best result.},

The study reveals that with the exception of teflon film electrode, the remaining three electrodes possess better response characteristics. As the membrane electrodes do not make use of ally specific ion conducting species or carrier molecules, the potential development is due to the interaction of the ions of the analyte with the functional groups of the plasticizer used to prepare the membrane. Based on the sensitivities obtained it is evident that these polymeric membrane electrodes are good for the analysis of alkali or alkaline earth metal ions. However, as the interaction of the ions with the functional group of the plasticizer determines the potential development, the selectivity towards a particular ion is not found in these electrodes and because of that they are suitable only for the analysis of individual metal ions.},

The labeled tracers were prepared by iododestannylation of the corresponding 4-(trimethylstannyl)phenyl compounds in radiochemical yield 63-96% and radiochemical purity >96%. Regional SPECT brain imaging was carried out over a period of 5 h with a Strichman 810X Brain Imager to assess regional uptake in the striatum and midbrain compared to reference regions in the occipital cortex and cerebellum; arterial blood samples were taken for analysis of metabolites by solvent extraction and HPLC. The methyl esters showed higher total and specific peak uptake in the striatum than the isopropyl esters. Midbrain uptake was uniformly lower than striatal uptake and washed out more rapidly. beta-CIT-FE had more rapid striatal kinetics than beta-CIT-FP, with specific striatal washout rates of 10-14 vs 4-6% peak/h. Biodistribution of [I-123]beta-CIT-FE and [I-123]beta-CIT-FP measured by whole body conjugate imaging demonstrated major uptake in the brain, liver, and GI tract, with excretion occurring through both the renal and hepatobiliary routes. Absorbed radiation dose estimates based on the MIRD schema indicated highest dose rates to the urinary bladder wall and lower large intestine wall (0.7 and 0.6 rad/mCi for [I-123]beta-CIT-FE and 0.7 and 0.9 rad/mCi for [I-123]beta-CIT-FP, respectively). The high uptake in the striatum and the relative specificity with respect to cortical, midbrain, and cerebellar areas, suggest that [I-123]beta-CIT-FE and [I-123]beta-CIT-FP may be valuable tracers for studying the dopamine system in vivo by tomographic imaging.},

Acylation of the dienyl copper reagent gives a dienyl ketone which spontaneously undergoes electrocyclization to a pyran derivative. The F-vinyl zinc reagents couple to aryl iodides in the presence of Pd degrees and provide useful stereoselective routes to alpha,beta,beta-trifluorostyrenes and 1-arylperfluoropropenes. Similar Pd degrees catalyzed coupling of the E-vinyl zinc reagent with 1-iodoperfluoroolefins provides a stereospecific route to F-dienes. Reaction of bromopentafluorobenzene with cadmium metal gives the analogous F-aryl cadmium reagent, which readily undergoes metathesis with Cu(I) salts to give the F-aryl copper reagent essentially quantitatively. The F-aryl copper reagent also adds stereospecifically syn to F-2-butyne to give a vinyl copper reagent which is easily alkylated, arylated or acylated,},

abstract={Microsomes from aminopyrine induced Jerusalem artichoke tubers catalyze hydroxylations of lauric acid at C8, C9 and C10 carbon position with a molar metabolite ratio of 1/5.6/2 respectively. We had previously shown that cytochrome P450 was responsible for the hydroxylation of lauric (dodecanoic) acid and die epoxidation and allylic hydroxylation of Z and E 9-dodecenoic acids. The incubation of microsomes from aminopyrine induced Jerusalem artichoke tubers with a series of {1-C-14]radiolabelled 7-, 8-, 9-, and 10-dodecenoic acids (n-DDNA) produced oxygenated compounds which have been characterized as epoxy and hydroxy derivatives by reverse phase-high pressure chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. The epoxidation/hydroxylation ratio was directly related to the position, but not to the geometry, of the double bond in the aliphatic chain. Z and E isomers of substrates were oxidized with similar efficiencies. Analysis of metabolites demonstrates that oxidative attack of this series of unsaturated analogues occurs with a regioselectivity similar to that of laurate hydroxylation. Based on specific inhibition of enzyme activities, it was demonstrated that cytochrome P450 monooxygenases carry out hydroxylation at saturated carbon positions as well as epoxidation of double bonds.},

A solution containing radio-labeled Cd+2, Co+2, Cr+3, and Zn+2 and a mix of ions typically found in soil solutions was used to assess specific absorption of inorganics to porous cups of samplers and to silica.  Four sets of samplers were cleaned with acid or water and then treated with a solution containing trace metals at concentrations near primary or secondary drinking-water standards or one order of magnitude lower for 2 or 7 d.  After treatment, the samplers were rinsed with 10 or 30 pore volumes (PV) of simulated soil solution and radioassayed.  Duplicate silica samples were treated with the high-trace-metal solution adjusted to a pH of 4, 6, or 8 for a 5-d period, rinsed with simulated soil solution, and radioassayed.  Adsorption was greatest on samplers treated with high trace-meal concentrations and samplers cleaned with water.  Desorption of both Co and Zn occurred with the 30-PV soil solution rinse for all sampler types except stainless steel.  The general pattern of metal adsorption on samplers was ceramic > stainless steel >> fritted glass = PTFE.  The general order that trace metal adsorbed to samplers and silica was Zn >> Co > Cr > Cd.  At pH values of 6 to 8, trace-metal adsorption on silica (mass of adsorbent/mass of adsorbate) was similar to or greater than that observed for ceramic samplers.  This study shows that adsorption-desorption processes can cause sampling error when analysis of trace metals at microgram-per-liter concentration levels is necessary.},

Objectives To investigate the effect of supportive devices in preventing subluxation, re‐positioning the head of humerus in the glenoid fossa, decreasing pain, increasing function and adversely increasing contracture in the shoulder after stroke. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched on 22 March 2004). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library , Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2004), CINAHL (1982 to March 2004), EMBASE (1974 to March 2004), AMED (1985 to March 2004) and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro, March 2004). We also handsearched conference proceedings and contacted authors for additional information. Selection criteria Studies were included if they were: randomised, quasi‐randomised or controlled trials; participants had a stroke; intervention was supportive devices; and subluxation, pain, function or contracture were measured. Data collection and analysis Two independent reviewers examined the identified studies which were assessed for methodological quality and analysed as (1) supportive devices versus no supportive devices or (2) two supportive devices. Main results Four trials (one on slings, three on strapping ‐ 142 participants) met the inclusion criteria. One trial testing a hemisling versus no device reported that no participants had subluxation greater than 10 mm, the same number had lost more than 30 degrees of shoulder external rotation (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1 to 9.3), and more participants in the hemisling group had pain (Peto OR 8.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 67.1). The other three showed that strapping was effective in delaying the onset of pain (weighted mean difference (WMD) 14 days, 95% CI 9.7 to 17.8), but was ineffective in reducing pain severity (WMD ‐0.7 cm on a visual analogue scale, 95% CI ‐2.0 to 0.7), increasing upper limb function (WMD 0.8, 95% CI ‐1.5 to 3.1) or affecting the degree of contracture (WMD ‐1.4 degrees, 95% CI ‐10.9 to 8.1) at the shoulder. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether slings and wheelchair attachments prevent subluxation, decrease pain, increase function or adversely increase contracture in the shoulder after stroke. There is some evidence that strapping the shoulder delays the onset of pain but does not decrease it, nor does it increase function or adversely increase contracture. Plain language summary Supportive devices for preventing and treating subluxation of the shoulder after stroke There is insufficient evidence to conclude that supportive devices are effective in the prevention and treatment of subluxation of the shoulder after stroke. Shoulder subluxation is one of the most common secondary musculoskeletal problems after stroke which can cause pain and hinder the recovery of upper limb function. Supportive devices have traditionally been applied to treat shoulder subluxation. This review of four trials found insufficient evidence to conclude whether supportive devices prevent subluxation or not and found no evidence to conclude whether supportive devices can reposition the head of humerus in the glenoid fossa of an already subluxed shoulder.},

abstract={Abstract - Background Surgical interventions are used for trigeminal neuralgia when drug treatment fails. Surgical treatments divide into two main categories, ablative (destructive) or non‐ablative. These treatments can be done at three different sites: peripherally, at the Gasserian ganglion level, and within the posterior fossa of the skull. Objectives To assess the efficacy of neurosurgical interventions for classical trigeminal neuralgia in terms of pain relief, quality of life and any harms. To determine if there are defined subgroups of patients more likely to benefit. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, (13 May 2010), CENTRAL (Issue 2, 2010 part of the Cochrane Library), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHSEED) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (Issue 4, 2010 (HTA, NHSEED and DARE are part of the Cochrane Library)), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2010) and EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2010) with no language exclusion. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of neurosurgical interventions used in the treatment of classical trigeminal neuralgia. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted authors for clarification and missing information whenever possible. Main results Eleven studies involving 496 participants met some of the inclusion criteria stated in the protocol. One hundred and eighty patients in five studies had peripheral interventions, 229 patients in five studies had percutaneous interventions applied to the Gasserian ganglion, and 87 patients in one study underwent two modalities of stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife) treatment. No studies addressing microvascular decompression (which is the only non‐ablative procedure) met the inclusion criteria. All but two of the identified studies had a high to medium risk of bias because of either missing data or methodological inconsistency. It was not possible to undertake meta‐analysis because of differences in the intervention modalities and variable outcome measures. Three studies had sufficient outcome data for analysis. One trial, which involved 40 participants, compared two techniques of radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RFT) of the Gasserian ganglion at six months. Pulsed RFT resulted in return of pain in all participants by three months. When this group were converted to conventional (continuous) treatment these participants achieved pain control comparable to the group that had received conventional treatment from the outset. Sensory changes were common in the continuous treatment group. In another trial, of 87 participants, investigators compared radiation treatment to the trigeminal nerve at one or two isocentres in the posterior fossa. There were insufficient data to determine if one technique was superior to another. Two isocentres increased the incidence of sensory loss. Increased age and prior surgery were predictors for poorer pain relief. Relapses were nonsignificantly reduced with two isocentres (risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence intervaI (CI) 0.30 to 1.71). A third study compared two techniques for RFT in 54 participants for 10 to 54 months. Both techniques produced pain relief (not significantly in favour of neuronavigation (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.04) but relief was more sustained and side effects fewer if a neuronavigation system was used. The remaining eight studies did not report outcomes as predetermined in our protocol. Authors' conclusions There is very low quality evidence for the efficacy of most neurosurgical procedures for trigeminal neuralgia because of the poor quality of the trials. All procedures produced variable pain relief, but many resulted in sensory side effects. There were no studies of microvascular decompression which observational data suggests gives the longest pain relief. There is little evidence to help comparative decision making about the best surgical procedure. Well designed studies are urgently needed. Plain language summary Neurosurgical interventions for the treatment of classical trigeminal neuralgia Trigeminal neuralgia is defined as "sudden usually unilateral severe brief stabbing recurrent pains in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve". It has an incidence rate of 12.6 per 100,000 person years and more commonly affects older age groups. The fifth cranial nerve is one of the largest in the head. The nerve is called trigeminal because it splits into three main branches. It provides sensation to the face. When neuralgia (nerve pain) occurs in the trigeminal nerve it causes severe and sudden face pain. The causes of trigeminal neuralgia are unclear. Treatment of all people with classical trigeminal neuralgia begins with drug therapy, most frequently using one of several drugs also used to treat epilepsy, among which the gold standard remains carbamazepine. If drug therapy fails then surgical interventions may be used. Surgical treatments divide into two main categories: ablative (destroying the nerve) or non‐ablative (preserving nerve function and relieving the pressure on the nerve). These procedures result in pain relief for variable lengths of time. For this review, we searched for all of the surgical procedures for trigeminal neuralgia. We found 11 studies, which included 496 patients, but only three had sufficient outcome data to report. These three studies, which involved a total of 181 participants, fulfilled the inclusion criteria and form the basis of this review. The primary aim of all three studies was to determine if one technique was better than the other. All three included studies evaluated destructive techniques. None of the three studies evaluated the non‐destructive procedure of microvascular decompression and this is a major drawback in the literature. One study compared two different techniques of radiofrequency thermocoagulation, in 40 participants six months after the procedure. This technique involves heating the nerve by passing an electrical current through the tip of a special needle which has been introduced through the skin into a hole in the base of the skull and into the ganglion from which the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve branch out (Gasserian ganglion). If the radiofrequency was given as pulsed treatment (which causes the tip of the needle to heat up intermittently and not continuously) the original pain in all participants returned by three months. The continuous radiofrequency treatment then had to be applied, and these participants then achieved pain control comparable to those who had received continuous radiofrequency throughout. Changes in sensation ranging from mild to severe numbness were common in the conventional (continuous) radiofrequency treatment group. A second trial, in 87 participants, looked at using one or two isocentres (specific points in the nerve) to deliver radiation to the trigeminal nerve just as it leaves the brainstem inside the skull. Use of medication afterwards was considered a surrogate measure for pain. Use of two isocentres increased the occurrence of sensory loss as a complication. Increased age and prior surgery were predictors for poorer pain relief. There were insufficient data given to judge the effectiveness of one procedure better than the other. A third study compared two techniques for performing radiofrequency thermocoagulation of the Gasserian ganglion in 54 participants. The study compared two ways of introducing the needle and guiding it, using either X‐rays or a special neuronavigation system. Pain relief was measured by a questionnaire at three months. Both techniques provided pain relief (which did not differ significantly between the two arms) but it was more sustained if a neuronavigation system was used and this system also decreased side effects. All the reviewed procedures resulted in pain relief and some participants were then able to stop taking medications. However, many procedures tended to result in sensory side effects. All the studies in this review had flaws in their methods and all but two showed considerable risk of bias. There is little evidence from these trials to guide the person with trigeminal neuralgia as to the most effective surgical procedure. There is now an urgent need to evaluate the surgical interventions used in trigeminal neuralgia and to design robust studies; either randomised controlled trials or long‐term prospective independently assessed cohort studies.},

abstract={Abstract - Background This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in  The Cochrane Library  in Issue 2, 2008 and previously updated in 2010. Tonsillectomy continues to be one of the most common surgical procedures performed in children and adults. Despite improvements in surgical and anaesthetic techniques, postoperative morbidity, mainly in the form of pain, remains a significant clinical problem. Postoperative bacterial infection of the tonsillar fossa has been proposed as an important factor causing pain and associated morbidity, and some studies have found a reduction in morbid outcomes following the administration of perioperative antibiotics. Objectives To determine whether perioperative antibiotics reduce pain and other morbid outcomes following tonsillectomy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 20 March 2012. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials examining the impact of perioperative administration of systemic antibiotics on post‐tonsillectomy morbidity in children or adults. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently collected data. Primary outcomes were pain, consumption of analgesia and secondary haemorrhage (defined as significant if patient re‐admitted, transfused blood products or returned to theatre, and total (any documented) haemorrhage). Secondary outcomes were fever, time taken to resume normal diet and activities and adverse events. Where possible, we generated summary measures using random‐effects models. Main results Ten trials, comprising a pooled total of 1035 participants, met the eligibility criteria. Most did not find a significant reduction in pain with antibiotics. Similarly, antibiotics were mostly not shown to be effective in reducing the need for analgesics. Antibiotics were not associated with a reduction in significant secondary haemorrhage rates (risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% CI 0.08 to 3.11, P = 0.45) or total secondary haemorrhage rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.44, P = 0.66). With regard to secondary outcomes, antibiotics reduced the proportion of patients with fever (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.85, P = 0.002). Authors' conclusions The present systematic review, including meta‐analyses for select outcomes, suggests that although individual studies vary in their findings, there is no evidence to support a consistent, clinically important impact of antibiotics in reducing the main morbid outcomes following tonsillectomy (i.e. pain, need for analgesia and secondary haemorrhage rates). The limited benefit apparent with antibiotics may be a result of positive bias introduced by several important methodological shortcomings in the included trials. Based on existing evidence, therefore, we would advocate against the routine prescription of antibiotics to patients undergoing tonsillectomy. Whether a subgroup of patients who might benefit from selective administration of antibiotics exists is unknown and needs to be explored in future trials. Plain language summary Antibiotics to reduce pain and improve recovery following tonsillectomy Tonsillectomy is a commonly performed operation in children and adults. Following the operation nearly all patients experience significant pain, need regular painkillers and are unable to resume normal diet and activities for several hours. Rarer but more dangerous complications, such as bleeding from the operated area, also occur. Antibiotics are commonly prescribed to reduce some or all of these undesirable consequences of tonsillectomy. The present review, however, suggests that antibiotics do not reduce pain, the need for painkillers or bleeding. They do, however, appear to reduce fever. This relatively minor benefit is more likely to be due to weaknesses in the studies themselves than any direct antibiotic effect. The risk of adverse events, such as skin rash and diarrhoea, is also slightly higher in patients who were prescribed antibiotics. Therefore, in the absence of clear‐cut and significant benefit, and with the potential for harm, we advocate against prescribing antibiotics routinely for patients undergoing tonsillectomy.},

abstract={Abstract - Background This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in  The Cochrane Library  in Issue 4, 2006. Otitis media with effusion (OME) or 'glue ear' is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation or infection. It is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and the usual reason for insertion of 'grommets'. Potential treatments include decongestants, mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines and antibiotics. Autoinflation devices have been proposed as a simple mechanical means of improving 'glue ear'. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of autoinflation compared with no treatment in children and adults with otitis media with effusion. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 12 April 2013. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials that compared any form of autoinflation to no autoinflation in individuals with 'glue ear'. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from included studies. Main results Eight studies, with a total of 702 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the studies were predominantly assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias; unclear risk was mainly due lack of information. There was no evidence of selective reporting. Pooled estimates favoured the intervention, but did not show a significant effect on tympanometry (type C2 and B) at less than one month, nor at more than one month. Similarly, there were no significant changes for discrete pure‐tone audiometry and non‐discrete audiometry. Pooled estimates favoured, but not significantly, the intervention for the composite measure of tympanogram or audiometry at less than one month; at more than one month the result became significant (RRI 1.74, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.50). Subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a Politzer device under one month (RRI 7.07, 95% CI 3.70 to 13.51) and over one month (RRI 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.04). None of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions. Authors' conclusions All of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and had short follow‐up. However, because of the low cost and absence of adverse effects it is reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion. Primary care could prove a beneficial place to evaluate such interventions and there is ongoing research in this area. Further research should also consider the duration of treatment, the long‐term impact on developmental outcomes in children and additional quality of life outcome measures for children and families. Plain language summary Autoinflation for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion (glue ear) Otitis media with effusion (OME) or 'glue ear' is very common in children and the hearing loss and discomfort, especially where the effusion is bilateral and long‐lasting, may lead to problems with language, development and behaviour. There are a number of treatment options including steroids, antibiotics, decongestants, antihistamines and surgery (the insertion of grommets (ventilation tubes)). Grommet insertion is one of the commonest operations of childhood. The best treatment strategy remains controversial, however, as glue ear often resolves spontaneously within a few months. Autoinflation is a technique whereby the Eustachian tube (the tube that connects the middle ear and the back of the nose) is reopened by raising pressure in the nose. This can be achieved by forced exhalation with closed mouth and nose, blowing up a balloon through each nostril or using an anaesthetic mask. The aim is to introduce air into the middle ear, via the Eustachian tube, equalising the pressures and allowing better drainage of the fluid. This review included eight randomised controlled trials of autoinflation for glue ear. All of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and had short follow‐up. The review authors used a combined outcome measure which included any outcome signifying improvement (as defined in the individual studies) and measured outcomes at the time points 'up to one month' and 'more than one month'. Improvement was demonstrated only in 'more than one month' analyses. Subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a Politzer device at both under one month and over one month. None of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions. The authors conclude that the evidence for the use of autoinflation in the short term appears favourable. Given the small number of studies and the lack of long‐term follow‐up, the long‐term effects associated with the use of these devices cannot be determined.},

abstract={Abstract - Background Post‐surgical radiotherapy (RT) in combination with chemotherapy is considered as standard of care for medulloblastoma in children. Chemotherapy has been introduced to improve survival and to reduce RT‐induced adverse effects. Reduction of RT‐induced adverse effects was achieved by deleting (craniospinal) RT in very young children and by diminishing the dose and field to the craniospinal axis and reducing the boost volume to the tumour bed in older children. Objectives Primary objectives: 1. to determine the event‐free survival/disease‐free survival (EFS/DFS) and overall survival (OS) in children with medulloblastoma receiving chemotherapy as a part of their primary treatment, as compared with children not receiving chemotherapy as part of their primary treatment; 2. to determine EFS/DFS and OS in children with medulloblastoma receiving standard‐dose RT without chemotherapy, as compared with children receiving reduced‐dose RT with chemotherapy as their primary treatment. Secondary objectives: to determine possible adverse effects of chemotherapy and RT, including long‐term adverse effects and effects on quality of life. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE/PubMed (1966 to August 2013) and EMBASE/Ovid (1980 to August 2013). In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and ongoing trial databases (August 2013). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the above treatments in children (aged 0 to 21 years) with medulloblastoma. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We performed analyses according to the guidelines of the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . Where possible, we pooled results. Main results The search identified seven RCTs, including 1080 children, evaluating treatment including chemotherapy and treatment not including chemotherapy. The meta‐analysis of EFS/DFS not including disease progression during therapy as an event in the definition showed a difference in favour of treatment including chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.91; P value = 0.007; 2 studies; 465 children). However, not including disease progression as an event might not be optimal and the finding was not confirmed in the meta‐analysis of EFS/DFS including disease progression during therapy as an event in the definition (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.47; P value = 0.93; 2 studies; 300 children). Two individual studies using unclear or other definitions of EFS/DFS also showed no clear evidence of difference between treatment arms (one study with unclear definition of DFS: HR 1.67; 95% CI 0.59 to 4.71; P value = 0.34; 48 children; one study with other definition of EFS: HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.21; P value = 0.34; 233 children). In addition, it should be noted that in one of the studies not including disease progression as an event, the difference in DFS only reached statistical significance while the study was running, but due to late relapses in the chemotherapy arm, this significance was no longer evident with longer follow‐up. There was no clear evidence of difference in OS between treatment arms (HR 1.06; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.67; P value = 0.80; 4 studies; 332 children). Out of eight reported adverse effects, of which seven were reported in one study, two (severe infections and fever/neutropenia) showed a difference in favour of treatment not including chemotherapy (severe infections: risk ratio (RR) 5.64; 95% CI 1.28 to 24.91; P value = 0.02; fever/neutropenia: RR not calculable; Fisher's exact P value = 0.01). There was no clear evidence of a difference between treatment arms for other adverse effects (acute alopecia: RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.08; P value = 1.00; reduction in intelligence quotient: RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.30; P value = 0.34; secondary malignancies: Fisher's exact P value = 0.5; haematological toxicity: RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.20 to 1.45; P value = 0.22; hepatotoxicity: Fisher's exact P value = 1.00; treatment‐related mortality: RR 2.37; 95% CI 0.43 to 12.98; P value = 0.32; 3 studies). Quality of life was not evaluated. In individual studies, the results in subgroups (i.e. younger/older children and high‐risk/non‐high‐risk children) were not univocal. The search found one RCT comparing standard‐dose RT with reduced‐dose RT plus chemotherapy. There was no clear evidence of a difference in EFS/DFS between groups (HR 1.54; 95% CI 0.81 to 2.94; P value = 0.19; 76 children). The RCT did not evaluate other outcomes and subgroups. The presence of bias could not be ruled out in any of the studies. Authors' conclusions Based on the evidence identified in this systematic review, a benefit of chemotherapy cannot be excluded, but at this moment we are unable to draw a definitive conclusion regarding treatment with or without chemotherapy. Treatment results must be viewed in the context of the complete therapy (e.g. the effect of surgery and craniospinal RT), and the different chemotherapy protocols used. This systematic review only allowed a conclusion on the concept of treatment, not on the best strategy regarding specific chemotherapeutic agents and radiation dose. Several factors complicated the interpretation of results including the long time span between studies with important changes in treatment in the meantime. 'No evidence of effect', as identified in this review, is not the same as 'evidence of no effect'. The fact that no significant differences between treatment arms were identified could, besides the earlier mentioned reasons, also be the result of low power or too short a follow‐up period. Even though RCTs are the highest level of evidence, it should be recognised that data from non‐randomised studies are available, for example on the use of chemotherapy only in very young children with promising results for children without metastatic disease. We found only one RCT addressing standard‐dose RT without chemotherapy versus reduced‐dose RT with chemotherapy, so no definitive conclusions can be made. More high‐quality research is needed. Plain language summary Chemotherapy for children with medulloblastoma Background Medulloblastoma is one of the most common malignant brain tumours in children. Chemotherapy is used to improve survival and diminish potential radiotherapy‐induced side effects. The reduction of radiotherapy‐induced side effects is achieved in very young children by not treating them with radiotherapy and in older children by diminishing the craniospinal radiotherapy (radiotherapy applied to the brain and spinal cord) dose and by reducing the boost volume to the tumour bed only instead of the whole posterior fossa (part of the brain). A well‐informed decision on the use of chemotherapy in the treatment of medulloblastoma in children should be based on high‐quality evidence on both the effectiveness against the tumour and side effects. Study characteristics We searched databases for randomised trials (studies where participants are allocated to one of two or more treatment groups in a random manner) evaluating the effectiveness of treatment including chemotherapy versus treatment not including chemotherapy (seven available studies) and on randomised studies evaluating the effectiveness of standard‐dose radiotherapy without chemotherapy versus reduced‐dose radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (one available study) in children (aged 0 to 21 years). The evidence is current to August 2013. Key results and quality of the evidence Based on the evidence identified in this systematic review a benefit of chemotherapy cannot be excluded, but at this moment we are unable to draw a definitive conclusion to favour treatment with or without chemotherapy. Even though randomised studies are the highest level of evidence, it should be recognised that data from non‐randomised studies were available, for example on the use of chemotherapy only in very young children. The results are promising for children without metastatic disease. For treatment with standard‐dose radiotherapy without chemotherapy as compared with reduced‐dose radiotherapy with chemotherapy, we also cannot make definitive recommendations. More high‐quality research is needed.},

abstract={Abstract - Background Paediatric flat feet are a common presentation in primary care; reported prevalence approximates 15%. A minority of flat feet can hurt and limit gait. There is no optimal strategy, nor consensus, for using foot orthoses (FOs) to treat paediatric flat feet. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of foot orthoses for treating paediatric flat feet. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to 01 September 2021, and two clinical trials registers on 07 August 2020. Selection criteria We identified all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of FOs as an intervention for paediatric flat feet. The outcomes included in this review were pain, function, quality of life, treatment success, and adverse events. Intended comparisons were: any FOs versus sham, any FOs versus shoes, customised FOs (CFOs) versus prefabricated FOs (PFOs). Data collection and analysis We followed standard methods recommended by Cochrane. Main results We included 16 trials with 1058 children, aged 11 months to 19 years, with flexible flat feet. Distinct flat foot presentations included asymptomatic, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), symptomatic and developmental co‐ordination disorder (DCD). The trial interventions were FOs, footwear, foot and rehabilitative exercises, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Due to heterogeneity, we did not pool the data. Most trials had potential for selection, performance, detection, and selective reporting bias. No trial blinded participants. We present the results separately for asymptomatic (healthy children) and symptomatic (children with JIA) flat feet. The certainty of evidence was very low to low, downgraded for bias, imprecision, and indirectness. Three comparisons were evaluated across trials: CFO versus shoes; PFO versus shoes; CFO versus PFO. Asymptomatic flat feet 1.  CFOs versus shoes  (1 trial, 106 participants): low‐quality evidence showed that CFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10‐point visual analogue scale (VAS)) at one year (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.07); absolute decrease (11.8%, 95% CI 4.7% fewer to 15.8% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19); absolute effect (3.4% more, 95% CI 4.1% fewer to 13.1% more). 2.  PFOs versus shoes  (1 trial, 106 participants): low to very‐low quality evidence showed that PFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10‐point VAS) at one year (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.16); absolute effect (4.7% fewer, 95% CI 18.9% fewer to 12.6% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23). 3.  CFOs versus PFOs  (1 trial, 108 participants): low‐quality evidence found no difference in the proportion without pain at one year (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18); absolute effect (7.4% fewer, 95% CI 22.2% fewer to 11.1% more); or on withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.12). Function and quality of life (QoL) were not assessed. Symptomatic (JIA) flat feet 1.  CFOs versus shoes  (1 trial, 28 participants, 3‐month follow‐up): very low‐quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain (0 to 10 scale, 0 no pain) between groups (MD ‐1.5, 95% CI ‐2.78 to ‐0.22). Low‐quality evidence showed improvements in function with CFOs (Foot Function Index ‐ FFI disability, 0 to 100, 0 best function; MD ‐18.55, 95% CI ‐34.42 to ‐2.68), child‐rated QoL (PedsQL, 0 to 100, 100 best quality; MD 12.1, 95% CI ‐1.6 to 25.8) and parent‐rated QoL (PedsQL MD 9, 95% CI ‐4.1 to 22.1) and little or no difference between groups in treatment success (timed walking; MD ‐1.33 seconds, 95% CI ‐2.77 to 0.11), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.94); absolute difference (9.7% fewer, 20.5 % fewer to 44.8% more). 2.  PFOs versus shoes  (1 trial, 25 participants, 3‐month follow‐up): very low‐quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain between groups (MD 0.02, 95% CI ‐1.94 to 1.98). Low‐quality evidence showed no difference between groups in function (FFI‐disability MD ‐4.17, 95% CI ‐24.4 to 16.06), child‐rated QoL (PedsQL MD ‐3.84, 95% CI ‐19 to 11.33), or parent‐rated QoL (PedsQL MD ‐0.64, 95% CI ‐13.22 to 11.94). 3.  CFOs versus PFOs  (2 trials, 87 participants): low‐quality evidence showed little or no difference between groups in pain (0 to 10 scale, 0 no pain) at 3 months (MD ‐1.48, 95% CI ‐3.23 to 0.26), function (FFI‐disability MD ‐7.28, 95% CI ‐15.47 to 0.92), child‐rated QoL (PedsQL MD 8.6, 95% CI ‐3.9 to 21.2), or parent‐rated QoL (PedsQL MD 2.9, 95% CI ‐11 to 16.8). Authors' conclusions Low to very low‐certainty evidence shows that the effect of CFOs (high cost) or PFOs (low cost) versus shoes, and CFOs versus PFOs on pain, function and HRQoL is uncertain. This is pertinent for clinical practice, given the economic disparity between CFOs and PFOs. FOs may improve pain and function, versus shoes in children with JIA, with minimal delineation between costly CFOs and generic PFOs. This review updates that from 2010, confirming that in the absence of pain, the use of high‐cost CFOs for healthy children with flexible flat feet has no supporting evidence, and draws very limited conclusions about FOs for treating paediatric flat feet. The availability of normative and prospective foot development data, dismisses most flat foot concerns, and negates continued attention to this topic. Attention should be re‐directed to relevant paediatric foot conditions, which cause pain, limit function, or reduce quality of life. The agenda for researching asymptomatic flat feet in healthy children must be relegated to history, and replaced by a targeted research rationale, addressing children with indisputable foot pathology from discrete diagnoses, namely JIA, cerebral palsy, congenital talipes equino varus, trisomy 21 and Charcot Marie Tooth. Whether research resources should continue to be wasted on studying flat feet in healthy children that do not hurt, is questionable. Future updates of this review will address only relevant paediatric foot conditions. Plain language summary Foot orthoses for treating flat feet in children Review question What are the benefits and harms of using foot orthoses (shoe inserts) to treat flat feet in children? Background Children with flat feet have a lower foot arch. When the child is standing, the foot arch looks flat against the floor, and may roll inwards, and even touch the floor. Sometimes, flat feet can cause pain, or change the way a child walks. There are many types of non‐surgical treatments for flat feet, but unless painful, most children do not need any treatment. Foot orthoses (FOs) or shoe inserts, muscle stretching, footwear selection, physical activity modification, and reducing body weight, may be part of an overall foot and activity management. The short‐term use of medication for pain and inflammation may be prescribed. Study characteristics This Cochrane Review is current to September 2021. There are 16 studies (1058 children, aged 11 months to 19 years) including three groups ‐ healthy children with painless flat feet; children with arthritis and painful flat feet; others (developmental coordination disorder; painful flat feet). The studies were conducted across the USA, Australia, India, Iran, Turkey, UK, and Republic of Korea. We found information about footwear, exercises, and different types of foot orthoses. Results: Comparing custom foot orthoses  ( CFOs) to shoes in painless flat feet: Proportion without pain (1 trial, 106 children) at 12 months: 12% fewer children with CFOs were without pain (ranging from 26% fewer to 5.5% more) 67 out of 100 children were without pain with CFOs compared to 79 children out of 100 with shoes. Withdrawal due to side effects (3 trials, 211 children): 3% more children with CFOs withdrew from treatment due to side effects (ranging from 4% fewer to 13% more) . 72 out of 100 children withdrew from treatment with CFOs compared with 69 children out of 100 with shoes. Comparing prefabricated foot orthoses (PFOs) to shoes in painless flat feet Proportion without pain (1 trial, 106 children) at 12 months: 5% fewer children with PFOs were without pain (ranging from 18.9% fewer to 12.6% more) 74 out of 100 children were without pain with PFOs compared to 79 out of 100 children with shoes. Withdrawal due to side effects (4 trials, 338 children): 0.7% fewer children with PFOs withdrew from treatment due to side effects (ranging from 15.2% fewer to 16.6% more). 71 out of 100 children withdrew from treatment with PFOs compared with 72 out of 100 children with shoes. Comparing CFOs to PFOs in painless flat feet Proportion without pain (1 trial, 106 children) at 12 months: 7% fewer children with CFOs were without pain (ranging from 22.2% fewer to 11.1% more) 68 out of 100 children were without pain with CFOs compared to 74 out of 100 children with PFOs. Withdrawal due to side effects (1 trial, 118 children): 0% fewer children withdrew from treatment with CFOs due to side effects (ranging from 9.2% fewer to 11% more). 91 out of 100 children withdrew from treatment with CFOs compared with 91 out of 100 children with PFOs. Function, quality of life, treatment success and side effects were not reported in these trials Quality of the evidence In healthy children with painless flat feet, low to very low‐quality evidence shows that compared to shoes, CFOs and PFOs result in no difference in the proportion without pain or withdrawal due to side effects from treatment. The quality of the evidence is very low to low, weakening conclusions. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because the trials were poorly conducted and there were not enough data.},

abstract={Abstract - Background Obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome(OSAHS) is the periodic reduction or cessation of airflow during sleep. The syndrome is associated with loud snoring, disrupted sleep and observed apnoeas. Surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome aims to alleviate symptoms of daytime sleepiness, improve quality of life, and reduce the signs of sleep apnoea recorded by polysomnography. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the effects of any type of surgery for the treatment of the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles. We contacted experts in the field, research dissemination bodies and other Cochrane Review Groups. Searches were current as of July 2008. Selection criteria Randomised trials comparing any surgical intervention for obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome with other surgical or non‐surgical interventions or no intervention. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers assessed electronic literature search results for possibly relevant studies. Characteristics and data from studies meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted and entered into RevMan 5. Main results Twelve studies (709 participants) of mixed risk of bias met the inclusion criteria. Data from ten studies were eligible for assessment in the review. The participants recruited to the studies had mixed levels of AHI, but tended to suffer from moderate daytime sleepiness where this was measured. No data could be pooled.  Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) versus conservative management (one trial) : An un‐validated symptom score showed intermittent significant differences over a 12‐month follow‐up period. No differences in Polysomnography (PSG) outcomes were reported.  Laser‐assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP) versus conservative management/placebo (two trials) : One study recruited a mixed population and separate data could not be obtained for this trial. In the other study no significant differences in Epworth scores or quality of life reported. A significant difference in favour of LAUP was reported in terms of apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) and frequency and intensity of snoring.  Palatal implants versus placebo (one trial):  Symptoms and AHI were lower with palatal implants.  LAUP versus bipolar radiofrequency volumetric tissue reduction (one trial) : Within‐treatment group differences were significant for symptoms and AHI, but the between treatment group differences were not available to assess whether indirect inferences could be made regarding the effects of either treatment.  UPPP versus oral appliance (OA) (one trial) : AHI was significantly lower with OA therapy than with UPPP. No significant differences were observed in quality of life.  UPPP versus lateral pharyngoplasty (lateral PP) (one trial) : No significant difference in Epworth scores, but a greater reduction in AHI with lateral PP was reported.  Expansion sphincter pharyngoplasty (one trial):  Both interventions reduced AHI although statistical analysis on the difference between treatments was not reported.  Tongue advancement (mandibular osteotomy) + PPP versus tongue suspension + PPP (one trial) : There was a significant reduction in symptoms in both groups, but no significant difference between the two surgery types. Complications reported with all surgical techniques included nasal regurgitation, pain and bleeding. These did not persist in the long term. An additional study assessed the effects of four different techniques. No data were available on between group comparisons.  Multilevel temperature‐controlled radiofrequency tissue ablation (TCRFTA) versus sham placebo and CPAP (one trial):  There was an improvement in primary and secondary outcomes of TCRFTA over sham placebo and but no difference in symptomatic improvement when compared with CPAP.  Radiofrequency assisted uvulopalatoplasty technique versus channeling technique (one trial):  Dysphagia scores were lower in the channeling group immediately post‐operation, but at four months the difference was no longer significant. Snoring scores did not differ at long‐term follow‐up. The number of participants achieving AHI lower than 10 at four months was slightly higher with RAUP than channeling technique. Authors' conclusions There are now a small number of trials assessing different surgical techniques with inactive and active control treatments. The studies assembled in the review have failed to demonstrate consistent effects in favour of surgery and do not provide convincing evidence to support its use in sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome. Short‐term outcomes are unlikely to consistently identify suitable candidates for surgery. Long‐term follow‐up of patients who undergo surgical correction of upper airway obstruction is required. This would help to determine whether surgery is a curative intervention, or whether there is a tendency for the signs and symptoms of sleep apnoea to re‐assert themselves, prompting patients to seek further treatment for sleep apnoea. Plain language summary Surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome Surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome aims to relieve obstruction by increasing the size of the airway in the throat, bypassing the airway or removing a lesion. A limited number of trials assessing diverse surgical techniques were identified. There were inconsistent effects reported across the trials. The available evidence from these small studies does not currently support the widespread use of surgery in people with mild to moderate daytime sleepiness associated with sleep apnoea.},

abstract={Abstract - Background Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are syndromes of severe respiratory failure that are associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. Artifical ventilatory support is commonly required and may exacerbate lung injury. Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) has been proposed as a less injurious form of ventilatory support for these patients. Although PLV has been shown to improve gas exchange and to reduce inflammation in experimental models of ALI, a previous systematic review did not find any evidence to support or refute its use in humans with ALI and ARDS. Objectives The primary objective of this review was to assess whether PLV reduced mortality (at 28 d, at discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU), at discharge from hospital and at one, two and five years) in adults with ALI or ARDS when compared with conventional ventilatory support. Secondary objectives were to determine how PLV compared with conventional ventilation with regard to duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of respiratory support, duration of oxygen therapy, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, incidence of infection, long‐term cognitive impairment, long‐term health related quality of life, long‐ term lung function, long‐term morbidity costs and adverse events. The following adverse events were considered: hypoxia (arterial PO 2  <80 mm Hg), pneumothorax (any air leak into the pleural space requiring therapeutic intervention), hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg sustained for longer than two minutes or requiring treatment with fluids or vasoactive drugs), bradycardia (heart rate < 50 beats per minute sustained for longer than one minute or requiring therapeutic intervention) and cardiac arrest (absence of effective cardiac output). Search methods In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 10, 2012, in  The Cochrane Library ; MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1966 to November 2012); EMBASE (Ovid SP, 1980 to November 2012) and CINAHL (EBSCOhost,1982 to November 2012) for published studies. In our original review, we searched until May 2004. Grey literature was identified by searching conference proceedings and trial registries and by contacting experts in the field. Selection criteria As in the original review, review authors selected randomized controlled trials that compared PLV with other forms of ventilation in adults (16 y of age or older) with ALI or ARDS, reporting one or more of the following: mortality; duration of mechanical ventilation, respiratory support, oxygen therapy, stay in the intensive care unit or stay in hospital; infection; long‐term cognitive impairment or health‐related quality of life; long‐term lung function or cost. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently evaluated the quality of the relevant studies and extracted the data from included studies. Main results In this updated review, one new eligible study was identified and included, yielding a total of two eligible studies (including a combined total of 401 participants). Of those 401 participants, 170 received 'high'‐dose partial liquid ventilation (i.e. a mean dose of at least 20 mL/kg), 99 received 'low‐dose' partial liquid ventilation (i.e. a dose of 10 mL/kg) and 132 received conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV). Pooled estimates of effect were calculated for all those who received 'high'‐dose PLV versus conventional ventilation. No evidence indicated that 'high'‐dose PLV either reduced mortality at 28 d (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.85, P = 0.37) or increased the number of days free of CMV at 28 d (mean difference (MD) ‐2.24, 95% CI ‐4.71 to 0.23, P = 0.08). The pooled estimate of effect for bradycardia in those who received PLV was significantly greater than in those who received CMV (RR 2.51, 95% CI 1.31 to 4.81, P = 0.005). Pooled estimates of effect for the following adverse events－hypoxia, pneumothorax, hypotension and cardiac arrest－all showed a nonsignificant trend towards a higher occurrence of these events in those treated with PLV. Because neither eligible study addressed morbidity or mortality beyond 28 d, it was not possible to determine the effect of PLV on these outcomes. Authors' conclusions No evidence supports the use of PLV in ALI or ARDS; some evidence suggests an increased risk of adverse events associated with its use. Plain language summary No evidence of benefit of partial liquid ventilation in adults with acute lung injury and some evidence of increased risk associated with its use Seriously ill adults can get a severe lung disease called  acute lung injury  or  acute respiratory distress syndrome,  which stops enough oxygen from getting into the blood. About half of these patients die, and for those who survive, it can take several years to get back to near normal. At the height of their illness, many of these patients are unable to breathe properly and need the assistance of a breathing machine called a  ventilator , which pushes gas into the lungs under pressure through a process called  artifical ventilation . Artifical ventilation can cause further damage to the lungs. The need to support breathing for these patients, while avoiding further lung damage, has led to a search for gentler types of ventilation. One such gentler type of ventilation is called  partial liquid ventilation . It uses a special liquid called  perfluorocarbon  instead of the gas used by traditional ventilators. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine whether patients with acute lung injury who received partial liquid ventilation were less likely to die or were more likely to recover completely than those who received traditional gas ventilation. To provide the best possible answer to this question, this review was conducted in a special preplanned way with the intention of putting together the results of all selected studies to produce an overall measure of the value of partial liquid ventilation. Two eligible studies (including a total of 401 participants) were found, and a comparison was made between those who received similar doses of perfluorocarbon and those who received traditional ventilation. No evidence indicated that partial liquid ventilation reduced the risk of death or the duration of artifical ventilation, and some evidence suggested that it may increase the risk of complications, including low blood oxygen levels, low heart rate, low blood pressure, air leakage from the lungs and cardiac collapse.},

abstract={Abstract - Background Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome are syndromes of severe respiratory failure. Children with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome have high mortality and the survivors have significant morbidity. Partial liquid ventilation is proposed as a less injurious form of respiratory support for these children. Uncontrolled studies in adults have shown improvements in gas exchange and lung compliance with partial liquid ventilation. A single uncontrolled study in six children with acute respiratory syndrome showed some improvement in gas exchange during three hours of partial liquid ventilation. This review was originally published in 2004, updated in 2009 and again in 2012. Objectives To assess whether partial liquid ventilation reduces mortality or morbidity, or both, in children with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Search methods In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 11); CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature) via Ovid (1982 to November 2011); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to November 2011); and Ovid EMBASE (1982 to November 2011). The search was last performed in August 2008. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared partial liquid ventilation with other forms of ventilation in children (aged 28 days to 18 years) with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Trials had to report one or more of the following: mortality; duration of mechanical ventilation, respiratory support, oxygen therapy, stay in the intensive care unit, or stay in hospital; infection; long‐term cognitive impairment, neurodevelopmental progress, or other long‐term morbidities. Data collection and analysis We independently evaluated the quality of the relevant studies and extracted the data from the included studies. Main results Only one study enrolling 182 patients (reported as an abstract in conference proceedings) was identified and found eligible for inclusion; the authors reported only limited results. The trial was stopped prematurely and was, therefore, under‐powered to detect any significant differences and at high risk of bias. The only available outcome of clinical significance was 28‐day mortality. There was no statistically significant difference between groups, with a relative risk for 28‐day mortality in the partial liquid ventilation group of 1.54 (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 2.9). Authors' conclusions There is no evidence from RCTs to support or refute the use of partial liquid ventilation in children with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Adequately powered, high quality RCTs are still needed to assess its efficacy. Clinically relevant outcome measures should be assessed (mortality at discharge and later, duration of both respiratory support and hospital stay, and long‐term neurodevelopmental outcomes). The studies should be published in full. Plain language summary Partial liquid ventilation for mechanical ventilation of severely ill children with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome The use of partial liquid ventilation to decrease the number of deaths and illness in children with acute onset respiratory failure is not supported by evidence from randomized controlled trials. Severely ill children can develop lung disease, called acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome, which stops sufficient oxygenation of the blood. The children are treated with mechanical ventilation through a tube placed in the airway. This improves lung function and the supply of oxygen to the body but it can also lead to ventilator‐induced lung injury. Children who survive an episode of this severe lung disease often have long‐term illness including decreased lung function, impaired cognitive function, poor neurodevelopmental progress, and high rates of permanent disability. Partial liquid ventilation could be a less injurious form of respiratory support. A special liquid (perfluorocarbon liquid) is poured into the lungs to partly replace the gas in the normally gas‐filled lungs, and mechanical ventilation is continued with a gas ventilator. We found only one multicentre randomized controlled study, reported as an abstract in conference proceedings, that was eligible for inclusion in this updated Cochrane review. The company sponsored study enrolled 182 patients in 65 centres. The trial was stopped early, before recruiting sufficient numbers of participants and before it could detect any clear differences between partial liquid ventilation and conventional mechanical ventilation (the control group). The number of deaths at 28 days was 22% of patients in the partial liquid ventilation group and 14% in the control group, the difference was not statistically significant; there was a wide variation in results and a clinically significant difference could not be excluded. There were other problems with the trial that made its results unreliable in terms of eligible patients, use of other rescue therapies, and that the measured outcomes were altered at least twice during the study; additional therapies such as high frequency ventilation or inhaled nitric oxide were allowed in the control group.},

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of water-soluble chemical compounds with an important number of applications, which have been widely used during the last 60 years. Two of them, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are the most known and well investigated. As for many other organic substances that are of environmental concern, the diet is the main route of human exposure to PFAS. However, in certain cases drinking water may also mean a significant contribution to human exposure, and to a lesser extent, dust and air (indoor exposure). In recent years, the environmental persistence of PFAS, their biomagnification in food webs, as well as their potential accumulation and toxicity, have generated a notable interest, which has been evidenced by the considerable number of publications in this regard. Recently, we carried out a wide revision on the levels of PFAS in food and human dietary intake. In the current review, we have summarized the recent information (last 10 years) published in the scientific literature (Scopus and PubMed) on the concentrations of PFAS in drinking water and the human health risks derived from the regular water consumption, when available. A large amount of data belongs to PFOS and PFOA and corresponds to studies mainly conducted in countries of the European Union, USA and China, although no information is available for most countries over the world. According to the toxicological information about PFAS that is so far available, the current health risks for the regular consumers of municipal/tap water do not seem to be of concern according to the levels considered as acceptable for various regulatory institutions.},

abstract={China has gradually become the most important manufacturing and consumption centre for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the world, and inadvertently become the world's major contamination hotspots. However, a systematic analysis of pollution pathways for PFOS/PFOA into the different environmental compartments and their quantification in China has yet to be carried out. This study focused on PFOS and PFOA release into the environment in the central and eastern region of China, which accounts for the vast majority of national emission. About 80-90% of PFOS/PFOA contamination in the Chinese environment was estimated to come directly from manufacturing and industrial sites mostly via wastewater discharge from these facilities. The other major contamination sources for PFOS were identified as being linked to aqueous fire-fighting foams (AFFFs), and pesticides including sulfluramid. For PFOA, following some way behind industrial wastewater, were industrial exhaust gas, domestic wastewater and landfill leachate as contamination sources. For surface water contamination, the major pollution contributors after industrial wastewater were AFFF spill runoff for PFOS, and domestic wastewater and precipitation-runoff for PFOA. The majority of PFOS that contaminated soil was considered to be linked with infiltration of AFFF and pesticides, while most PFOA in soil was attributed to atmospheric deposition and landfill leachate. Where groundwater had become contaminated, surface water seepage was estimated to contribute about 50% of PFOS and 40% of PFOA while the remainder was mostly derived from soil leaching. A review of the available monitoring data for PFOS/PFOA in the literature supported the view that industrial wastewater, landfill leachate and AFFF application were the dominant sources. Higher concentrations of PFOA than PFOS found in precipitation also corroborated the prediction of more PFOA release into air. To reduce PFOS/PFOA contamination of the Chinese environment the focus for control should be on industrial wastewater emissions.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Liquid Ventilation consists of partially or completely filling the lungs with a fluid (perfluorcarbon). This brings about elimination of the air-liquid interface and reduction of the surface tension in lungs with surfactant deficiency. This article focuses on the role of liquid ventilation in the treatment of acute respiratory failure in children. METHODS: A systematic review of literature was conducted using MEDLINE, LILACS and COCHRANE LIBRARY databases and references of articles. Match terms were: Liquid Ventilation, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Meconium Aspiration Syndrome, Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Randomized clinical trials, cohort studies and case control studies were searched for. Blood oxygenation, respiratory mechanics and survival were the outcomes evaluated. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty four publications related to liquid ventilation were selected during the study period: 19 (7.5%) were clinical trials and only six of them focused on the use of Liquid Ventilation in children. All six publications were characterized as phase I and II clinical trials and analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS: Upon analysis of these trials it was concluded that, because of the lack of controlled and randomized clinical trials, liquid ventilation cannot be recommended as a therapy for children with acute respiratory failure.},

abstract={Pyelonephritis is an inflammatory process, and oxidative stress plays a major role in it. Anti-inflammatory or antioxidant therapy given concomitantly with antibiotics should lower the risk of postpyelonephritic scarring. As the lack of review studies in the use of antioxidants in urinary tract infections was detected, this study was designed. We conducted a review of available articles in PubMed and Google Scholar with a simple review, using keywords of "antioxidant" and "pyelonephritis" with all their possible synonyms and combinations. Only interventional studies were collected. There were neither limitations on time, nor the location of the study, type of subjects, administration rout of the antioxidant drug, and the antioxidant drug used. After studying the abstracts or in some cases the full text of articles, they were categorized based on the type of antioxidant, type and number of subjects, rout of administration, dosing, duration of treatment, year of publication of the paper, and the results. A total of 66 articles published from 1991 to 2015 were found by studying just the title of the papers. Studying the abstracts reduced this number to 51 studies. Antioxidants used for this condition were Vitamins A, E, and C, cytoflavin, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, ebselen, allopurinol, melatonin, N-acetylcysteine, oleuropein, montelukast, oxytocin, ozon, dapsone, pentoxifyllin, tadalafil, bilirubin, cranberry, meloxicam, L-carnitine, colchicine, perfluoran, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone. Studies show that antioxidants are capable of reducing oxidative stress and can be used effectively along with antibiotics to reduce the scar formation.},

abstract={PURPOSE: To review the current literature on retinal displacement and provide a discussion of potential risk factors, postoperative outcomes, and future directions. METHODS: Two databases, MEDLINE and EMBASE, were mined using a directed search strategy to identify all articles on retinal displacement. RESULTS: We identified 1522 articles. A total of n = 14 articles were retained. We provide an overview on the potential influence of surgical type (n = 4), tamponade agents (n = 5), postoperative posture (n = 6), and preoperative retinal status (n = 5) on incidence of retinal displacement and visual outcomes (n = 8). Discussion. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with gas tamponade is associated with displacement rates of up to 72%, typically in a downward direction. Meanwhile, pneumatic retinopexy and PPV with silicone oil may offer similar surgical success with a significantly lower risk of displacement. The impact of heavy liquids such as perfluorocarbon liquid, postoperative positioning and preoperative extent of detachment on displacement remains inconclusive. Patients with displacement had a significantly lower visual acuity and higher rates of distortion than those without displacement. However, not all patients with displacement experienced visual symptoms. CONCLUSION: Retinal displacement is a new concept in our understanding of retinal detachment. Additional studies are needed to better define its impact on postsurgical outcomes.},

abstract={Growing evidence indicates that exposure to widespread, environmental contaminants called endocrine disruptors (EDCs) negatively affects animal and human reproductive health and has been linked to several diseases including infertility. This review aims to evaluate the impact of environmental exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals [phthalates, parabens, triclosan, bisphenol A (BPA), organochlorine (PCBs) and perfluorinated (PFCs) compounds] on the reproductive potential among women, by reviewing most recently published literature. Epidemiological studies focusing on EDCs exposure and reproductive potential among women for the last 16 years were identified by a search of the PUBMED, MEDLINE, EBSCO and TOXNET literature databases. The results of the presented studies show that exposure to EDCs impacts the reproductive potential in women, measured by ovarian reserve and by assisted reproductive technology outcomes. Exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals decrease: (i) oestradiol levels (BPA); (ii) anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations (PCBs); (iii) antral follicle count (BPA, parabens, phthalates); (iv) oocyte quality (BPA, triclosan, phthalates, PCBs); (v) fertilization rate (PFCs, PCBs); (vi) implantation (BPA, phthalates, PCBs); (vii) embryo quality (triclosan, PCBs, BPA); (viii) rate of clinical pregnancy and live births (parabens, phthalates). The studies were mostly well-designed and used prospective cohorts with the exposure assessment based on the biomarker of exposure. Considering the suggested health effects, more epidemiological data is urgently needed to confirm the presented findings.},

abstract={Oxygen deficient hypoxic cells, which are resistant to sparsely ionising radiation, have now been identified in most animal and some human solid tumours and will influence the response of those tumours to radiation treatment. This hypoxia can be either chronic, arising from an oxygen diffusion limitation, or acute, resulting from transient stoppages in microregional blood flow. Although clinical attempts to overcome hypoxia have met with some success, the results have been far from satisfactory, and efforts are still being made to find better methods. Extensive experimental studies, especially in the last decade, have shown that nicotinamide and structurally related analogs can effectively sensitise murine tumours to both single and fractionated radiation treatments and that they do so in preference to the effects seen in mouse normal tissues. The earliest studies suggested that this enhancement of radiation damage was the result of an inhibition of the repair mechanisms, as was well documented in vitro. However, recent studies in mouse tumours have shown that the primary mode of action actually involves a reduction in tumour hypoxia. More specifically, these drugs prevent transient cessations in blood flow, thus inhibiting the development of acute hypoxia. This novel discovery led to the suggestion that the potential role of these agents as radiosensitizers would be when combined with treatments that overcame chronic hypoxia. The first attempt to demonstrate this combined nicotinamide with hyperthermia and found that the enhancement of radiation damage by both agents together was greater than that seen with each agent alone. Similar results were later seen for nicotinamide combined with a perfluorochemical emulsion, carbogen breathing, and pentoxifylline, and in all these studies the effects in tumours were always greater than those seen in appropriate normal tissues. Of all the analogs, it is nicotinamide itself which has been the most extensively studied as a radiosensitizer in vivo and the one that shows the greatest effect in animal tumours. It is also an agent that has been well established clinically for the treatment of a variety of disorders, with daily doses of up to 6 g being considered reasonably safe and associated with a low incidence of side effects. This human dose is equivalent to 100-200 mg/kg in mice and such doses will maximally sensitize murine tumours to radiation. These findings have now resulted in phase I/II clinical trials of nicotinamide, in combination with carbogen breathing, as a potential radiosensitizing treatment.},

There is growing evidence that they can contribute to the current emergence of chronic diseases. OBJECTIVES: Our aim is to assess the relationships between endocrine disruptors and the neonatal health outcomes. METHODS: Two persons have independently reviewed Medline and Toxline databases about the following pollutants: bisphenol A, phthalates, parabens, brominated flame retardants and perfluorinated compounds. Only the human epidemiological studies, in general population with an abstract available, published between 2007 January the 1st and 2011 December the 31st, were analysed. The quality of each study was assessed with the Strobe score. RESULTS: Twenty-five out of 680 studies were included in the analysis. All pollutants were widely detected in maternal and new borns samples. Most of the studies have shown associations between bisphenol A, brominated flame retardants and perfluorinated compounds and lower birth weight. The effects on gestational age were less documented and have shown no clear connection. Results for phthalates were more ambiguous. Only one non-instructive study was found on parabens. DISCUSSION: Due to the inherent methological bias on endocrine disruptors research, further additional studies on environmental health must be investigated. It seems necessary to adopt preventive health measures first for vulnerable population.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Allergic diseases are one of the most common and important diseases that can exert hazardous effects on children's health. The prevalence of allergic diseases in childhood is gradually increasing all over the world in recent decades. Known causes of these diseases include anomalous immune responses and allergic inflammatory reactions, but the causes of allergic diseases in childhood are complex. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Science were searched for articles focusing on environmental exposure during pregnancy and the risk of childhood allergic diseases, including asthma and atopic dermatitis, and the possible underlying mechanism. RESULTS: In terms of environmental factors, allergic diseases in childhood are closely related to environmental chemical exposure during pregnancy, including bisphenols, phthalates acid esters, perfluorochemicals, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and polychlorinated biphenyls. However, allergic diseases in childhood are also closely associated with maternal dietary nutrition, maternal intake of drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), paracetamol and antibiotics, and maternal lifestyle. CONCLUSIONS: Several harmful environmental factors during pregnancy can result in the interruption of the function of helper T cells (Th1/Th2), cytokines and immunoglobulins and may activate allergic reactions, which can lead to allergic diseases during childhood.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) are ubiquitous and may significantly contribute in environmental pollution, thus contaminating humans and wildlife. Environmental pollutants could interfere with bone homeostasis by means of different mechanisms, which include hormonal imbalance, direct osteoblasts toxicity and enanchment of osteoclasts activity, thus leading to osteopenia or osteoporosis. Among these, bisphenols, dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorobiphenyls, poly- and perfluoroalkyls, phthalates, parabens, organotins and cadmium may play a role in bone distuption. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI-web of knowledge and Google scholar databases were searched for medical subject headings terms and free-text word related to the aforementioned classes of chemicals and bone metabolism and remodelling for better clarifying and understanding the main mechanisms of bone disruption. RESULTS: Several of EDCs act as xenoestrogens. Considering that estrogens play a significant role in regulating bone remodeling, most of these chemicals generate hormonal imbalance with possible detrimental consequences on bone tissue structure and its mechanical and non-mechanical properties. DISCUSSION: A lot of evidences about bone distruptors came from in vitro studies or animal models, and conduct to equivocal results. In addition, a few data derived form humans and most of these data focused on the impact of EDCs on bone mineral density without considering their influence on long-term fracture risk. Moreover, it should be taken into account that humans are exposed to a mixture of EDCs and the final effect on bone metabolism might be the result of either a synergism or antagonist effects among them. Age of first exposure, cumulative dose exposure over time, and the usually observed non-monotonic dose-response curve for EDCs should be considered as other important variable influencing the final effect on bone metabolism. CONCLUSION: Taking into account these variables, observational studies are needed to better analyze this issue both for echological purpose and to preserve bone health.},

abstract={PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prominent chronic liver disease in Western countries, affecting approximately 25% of the population worldwide. Sex-specific differences in the development of NAFLD are apparent. While obesity and insulin resistance are major contributors to the increasing prevalence of NAFLD, a growing body of literature suggests that exposure to persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals (pEDCs) may also play a role. This review summarizes recent (2011 and later) scientific literature investigating exposures to pEDCs, specifically persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and NAFLD, with a focus on sex-specific associations. RECENT FINDINGS: The overwhelming majority of studies were conducted in single-sex animal models and provide biological evidence that exposures to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin polychlorinated biphenyls, and other POPs or POP mixtures are negatively associated with liver health. There were four cross-sectional epidemiological studies in humans that reported associations for several POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls and perfluorinated chemicals, with elevated liver enzymes. Only one of these studies, using a sample of gastric bypass surgery patients, examined sex-specific associations of POPs and liver enzymes, finding adverse associations among women only. The noticeable lack of studies investigating how differences (i.e., biochemical, physiological, and behavioral) between men and women may influence associations of pEDCs and NAFLD represents a large research gap in environmental health. Sexual dimorphism in metabolic processes throughout the body, including the liver, is established but often overlooked in the designs and analyses of studies. Other factors identified in this review that may also act to modulate associations of environmental chemicals and NAFLD are reproductive status and dietary nutrient intakes, which also remain understudied in the literature. Despite knowledge of sexual dimorphism in the actions of pEDCs, as well as in metabolic processes related to NAFLD development, few experimental or epidemiological studies have investigated sex-dependent associations. Future studies, especially those in humans, should be designed to address this research need. Consideration of other factors, such as reproductive status, dietary intakes, and mixtures of chemicals with varying endocrine-disrupting capabilities, should be explored.},

The findings reveal research gaps that should be addressed. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed) for full text English articles published in 2006-2020 using the keywords "environmental exposure" and "obesity". A total of 821 articles were retrieved; 102 reported relationships between environmental exposure and obesity indices. ECs were the predominantly studied environmental exposure compounds. The ECs were grouped into phenols, phthalates, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to evaluate obesogenic roles. In total, 106 articles meeting the inclusion criteria were summarized after an additional search by each group of EC combined with obesity in the PubMed and Scopus databases. Dose-dependent positive associations between bisphenol A (BPA) and various obesity indices were revealed. Both individual and summed di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and non-DEHP metabolites showed inconsistent associations with overweight and obesity indices, although mono-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), and mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) seem to have obesogenic roles in adolescents, adults, and the elderly. Maternal exposure levels of individual POP metabolites or congeners showed inconsistent associations, whereas dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were positively associated with obesity indices. There was insufficient evidence of associations between early childhood EC exposure and the subsequent development of overweight and obesity in late childhood. Overall, human evidence explicitly reveals the consistent obesogenic roles of BPA, DDE, and PFOA, but inconsistent roles of phthalate metabolites and other POPs. Further prospective studies may yield deeper insights into the overall scenario.},

abstract={The subject of this thesis is to study cellular reactions to topographically, mechanically and biochemically tunable polymeric biomaterials. Different aspects of in vitro cell-biomaterial interactions were systematically studied with the murine fibroblast cell line NIH L929 and primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). Besides a general cytocompatibility assessment of the applied materials and the quantification of cell adhesion per se, cell morphological changes (e.g. cell spreading) and intracellular processes such as F-actin stress fiber polymerization and focal adhesion (FA) assembly were analyzed in detail by live imaging, electron microscopy as well as by fluorescence microscopy of immunologically stained samples. The focus of the first part of the thesis lies on cell culture studies on the surfaces of two diametrically opposed polymers; a very hydrophobic perfluoropolyether (PFPE) and a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrophilic hydrogel. The applicability of PFPE as a patternable biomaterial was evaluated and the results have demonstrated that PFPE is an interesting substrate for several biological applications from fundamental research to implant design. Bulk PEG hydrogels were applied for comprehensive studies on the correlation between material surface characteristics and cell behavior. It was elucidate whether the protein- and cell-repellent properties of PEG are impacted by the introduction of surface topography or by variations of mechanical substrate properties or a combination thereof. In vitro experiments with L929 fibroblasts showed that the imprinted topography (via molding) enabled cell adhesion and spreading on the otherwise anti-adhesive surfaces. Especially surface patterns with dimensions in the range of the cells’ own size, namely 10 µm wide grooves, induced the adhesion of a significantly higher number of cells. Furthermore, it was shown that VN is a major elicitor of initial cell adhesion to PEG and that this initial interaction is manifested by and can only persist due to the presence of surface patterns. In contrast to the results gained from in vitro studies on smooth substrates which revealed no stiffness-dependent change in cell behavior, a different cell reaction was evident once variations in crosslinking density were combined with topography. Softer substrates with line patterns led to significantly more cell adhesion and spreading than stiff substrates. Studies concerning cell behavior inside of three-dimensional (3D) matrices are subject of the second part of this thesis. The possibility of using topographical modifications to purposely influence cell growth not only on hydrogel surfaces but also in a 3D matrix is described. A stable oriented tubular morphology with diameters in the cell size range (5-15 µm) was introduced to PEG-based hydrogels by uniaxial freezing. It could be shown that such morphology results in pronounced unidirectional growth of cells throughout the gels and supports long-term cell survival. Furthermore a semi-synthetic hydrogel system (hyaluronic acid (HA) crosslinked with PEG linkers) is introduced as a 3D matrix for cell encapsulation. These hydrogels are tunable regarding their biofunctionality and mechanical properties and support cell spreading and migration as well as proliferation and survival (>10 days). Furthermore, a two-component approach, combining the HA-based hydrogels with a network of biofunctional nanofibers is presented, The successful integration of (parallelly aligned) fibers to guide and enhance growth of embedded cells is shown. The results underline the suitability of the system as a biomimetic artificial ECM for specific cell guidance and delivery. By combining topographical, mechanical and biochemical modifications of new and well-known materials individual and synergistic effects of these parameters on cell behavior were analyzed systematically. The results build a relevant fundament for the design of intelligent biomaterials, e.g. for an application in the fields of regenerative medicine, tissue engineering or diagnostics.},

abstract={Performance and efficiency of polymeric optoelectronic devices strongly depends on morphology, mixing behavior and purity of the conjugated polymers used. The transport behavior of electric charge carriers - holes and electrons - can be directly tuned by these properties. It also has great impact on loss processes in polymeric light emitting diodes (PLED) and polymeric photovoltaic devices (OPV). Typically, charge transport in a conjugated polymer is unbalanced, e.g. hole transport along the backbone of a conjugated polymer is of space-charge-limited nature and trap free. Electron transport in principle follows the same mechanism, but in contrast to hole transport it suffers trapping of electrons in localized energetic states within the energy band gap of the conjugated polymer, which leads to an overall reduction of electron transport by more than three orders of magnitude. The disparity of hole and electron transport leads to a severe loss process in both PLEDs and OPVs: excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) are generated close to the cathode contact and decay non-radiatively by transfer of their recombination energy to the metallic contact via dipole-dipole interaction mechanism. Additionally, non-radiative trap-assisted recombination occurs as another loss process. In order to address the loss processes in conjugated polymers, the work in this thesis is focused on tuning the charge carrier transport in conjugated polymers by blending them with other conjugated and non-conjugated polymers. The first chapter introduces the work and discusses on the physical and chemical background of conjugated polymers, electrical devices and the phase dynamics of polymer mixtures that are relevant for comprehension. In the second chapter a discussion on the role of morphology of MEH-PPV:PVK blends on charge transport properties in hole and electron only devices. It is demonstrated how morphology evolves from phase dynamics of the different polymer blends and how the intimacy of the blend constituents affects the charge transport properties in solution processed active layers of hole only and electron only devices. It is found that weak segregation of the blend components takes place into coexisting MEH-PPV-rich and PVK-rich phases. Ultimately, it is demonstrated that for MEH-PPV:PVK thin film devices with weight ratios of 1:9 equilibrated electron and hole transport is observed as the negative effect of trapped electrons is effectively eliminated due to dilution of the low band gap polymer MEH-PPV in the high band gap polymer PVK. To strengthen and broaden the findings made in chapter 2, in chapter 3 polystyrene is introduced as an insulating polymer into the blend system with MEH-PPV. Polystyrene is an insulator with an even higher band gap than PVK and available in a wide variety of molecular weights and suitable to prove the generality of the previously reported performance improvement by dilution of the conjugated polymer and its electronic trap states, also in comparison to the MEH-PPV:PVK blends mentioned in chapter 2. First, the third chapter focuses on calculating the phase dynamics in order to qualitatively predict mixing behavior of the MEH-PPV:PS blend when solution processed. Second, it compares the morphological outcome and electronic performance. Two distinct cases are presented and analyzed. The first case , a fully phase separating blend MEH-PPV with a molecular weight of 354~kg/mol and polystyrene with a molecular weight of 35~kg/mol, with no improvement in electronic performance of light emitting devices, independent from weight ratio between the two polymers. The second case, again the same MEH-PPV but in a blend with a low molecular weight polystyrene with 1.1~kg/mol, fully miscible when spin cast from solution and showing improved electron transport properties by three orders of magnitude. Ultimately, this chapter emphasizes the importance of phase dynamics that is directly related to performance of solution processed thin film devices. It also shows that MEH-PPV based PLEDs can be doubled in efficiency by using an insulating diluent polymer such as polystyrene in a weight ratio of 1:9. The fourth chapter concentrates on expanding the previous studies on other conjugated polymer blends such as BEH-PPV:PS. At first glance, BEH-PPV as compared to MEH-PPV looks very similar, but the substitution pattern of side chains is symmetric. The on chain order of BEH-PPV is increased and higher mobility of charge carriers is feasible when used in thin film devices. Lower operating voltages are possible and therefore of practical importance for improved device performance. As a first result, trap free electron transport in BEH-PPV:PS electron only devices is demonstrated successfully. However, BEH-PPV gives rise to different phase dynamics than MEH-PPV when blended with low molecular weight polystyrene. Indeed, though lateral phase separation is not observed experimentally, injection issues of positive charge carriers into BEH-PPV:PS thin films are observed. A systematic study of the origin of these injection issues on thin films of BEH-PPV:PS blends in different weight ratios is performed by Kelvin-Probe and ToF-SIMS analysis. It is revealed that not a mismatch of energetic levels, but rather a surface directed effect on the vertical composition of the blend creates preferential accumulation of insulating polystyrene on the PEDOT:PSS injection contact. Finally, by blending the PEDOT:PSS injection contact with perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (FOS) in excess a lowering of the surface energy of the PEDOT:PSS contact is achieved. Injection issues are eliminated successfully by fabrication of hole only devices made with PEDOT:PSS:FOS hole injection contacts and BEH-PPV:PS 1:9 as active thin film. Together with the demonstration of trap free electron transport in BEH-PPV:PS 1:9 thin films promising device performances are obtained. The fifth chapter discusses the role of density of structural defects of the conjugated polymer BEH-PPV on electron only device performance. More specifically, a study on electron only device performance as a function of chain end density is performed. The chain end density is seen as a critical origin of energetic trap sites for positive and negative charge carriers simultaneously. Therefore, most synthesis routes focus on creation of high molecular weight BEH-PPV in order to reduce the chain end density to rule out the possible negative effects, accepting the compromise of fairly poor solution processability. Here the electron transport properties of BEH-PPV polymers is studied in electron only devices. The molecular weight of the solution processed BEH-PPV thin films is varied in the range of two orders of magnitude in number average molecular weight, namely BEH-PPV with 52~kg/mol, 123~kg/mol and 521~kg/mol. Device performance is simulated with the extended Gaussian disorder model, where mobility, trap density and electronic disorder is analyzed. Within the chosen molecular weight range no significant change in trap density as well as transport behavior of electrons is observed. As a recommendation, the synthesis of BEH-PPV in the number molecular weight range around 100~kg/mol is proposed. An intermediate molecular weight of BEH-PPV can improve solution processability in terms of repeatability and preparation time without any effective disadvantage of increased structural defects due to increased chain end density. ; Verlustprozesse limitieren die Effizienz polymerbasierter Leuchtdioden (PLED) und Solarzellen (OPV). Sie entstehen durch eine Disparität von Loch- und Elektronentransport, wobei letzterer typischerweise drei Größenordnungen kleiner ist, da lokalisierte energetische Fallenzustände innerhalb der Bandlücke eines halbleitenden konjugierten Polymers existieren. Dies hat zur Folge, dass Rekombination von Elektronen mit Löchern strahlungsfrei über Fallenzustände oder Relaxation von Excitonen in der Nähe des Kathodenkontaktes geschehen. Der Ladungstransport und die Verlustmechanismen können durch geeignete Wahl und Mischung halbleitender konjugierter Polymere kontrolliert und verbessert werden. Prinzipien der Soft-Matter Dynamics, wie Mischungsverhalten und Einstellen morphologischer Eigenschaften werden in dieser Arbeit dazu genutzt Verlustmechanismen in halbleitenden polymerbasierten Bauteilen zu identifizieren und zu reduzieren. Es wird dabei eine Verbindung zwischen Mischungsdynamik, Morphologie und Performance optoelektronischer Bauteile hergestellt. Im Besonderen wird die Mischungsdynamik Polyphenylenevinylene-basierter Polymere mit halbleitenden und isolierenden Polymeren, wie Polyvinylkarbazol und Polystyrol über Phasendiagramme vorausberechnet. Analysen über die Morphologie und Topologie der Dünnschichten werden hergestellt und herangezogen sowie in optoelektronischen Bauteilen praktisch erprobt. Abschließend kann durch die Verbindung von Mischungsdynamik und Bauteil-Performance gezeigt werden, dass energetische Fallenzustände innerhalb der Bandlücke halbleitender konjugierter Polymere in ihren negativen Eigenschaften neutralisiert werden können. Der Ladungstransport wird homogenisiert und die Effizienz der optoelektronischen Bauteile wird erhöht. ; XVI, 99 Seiten Illustrationen, Diagramme},

abstract={Commercially available 4,4-dichlorodiphenylsulfone (DCDPS) was successfully disulfonated with fuming sulfuric acid to yield 3,3-disodiumsulfonyl-4,4-dichlorodiphenylsulfone (SDCDPS). Subsequently, DCDPS and SDCDPS were systematically reacted with 4,4-biphenol under nucleophilic step polymerization conditions to generate a series of high molecular weight, film-forming, ductile, ion conducting copolymers. These were converted to the acid form and investigated as proton exchange membranes for fuel cells. Hydrophilicity increased with the level of sulfonation. However, water sorption increased gradually until about 50 mole percent SDCDPS was incorporated, and thereafter showed a large increase to yield water soluble materials for the 100% SDCDPS system. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirmed that the morphology of the copolymers displayed continuity of the hydrophilic phase at 60 mole percent SDCDPS. Conductivity measurements in the 40-50 mole percent SDCDPS range, where excellent mechanical strength was maintained, produced values of 0.1 S/cm or higher which were comparable to the control, Nafion. These compositions also show a high degree of compatibility with heteropolyacids such as phosphotungstic acid. These inorganic compounds provide a promising mechanism for obtaining conductivity at temperatures well above the boiling point of water and membrane compositions containing them are being actively pursued. The water soluble 100% SDCDPS system was further investigated by successfully functionalizing the endgroups to afford aromatic amines via appropriate endcapping with m-aminophenol. Oligomers and polymers from 5-30 kg/mole number average molecular weight were synthesized and well characterized by NMR spectroscopy, endgroup titrations and size exclusion chromatography. The diamino-telechelic sulfonated segment was reacted with several dianhydrides and diamines to produce multiblock, hydrophobic polyimide-hydrophilic sulfonated polyarylene ether copolymers. Both ester-acid and amic acid synthesis routes were utilized in combination with spin-casting and bulk imidization. A series of tough, film-forming segmented copolymers was prepared and characterized. AFM measurements demonstrated the generation of quite well defined, nanophase-separated morphologies which were dependent upon composition as well as aging in a humid environment. Characterizations of the segmented copolymers for conductivity, and water and methanol sorption were performed and comparisons to state-of-the-art perfluorinated Nafion systems were made. It is concluded that the segmented or block systems have the potential to enhance certain desirable PEM characteristics in fuel cells, particularly those related to swelling, retention of mechanical strength at elevated temperatures, and critical adhesion issues in membrane electrode assemblies. ; Ph.

abstract={[eng] Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large group of man-made chemicals that are widely used throughout society and found in the environment. These compounds are characterized by perfluorinated carbon chains of varying lengths with hydrophobic properties and containing an external polar and hydrophilic head. The difference between perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) are found on the polar head of the chemicals. In general, the characteristics of PFASs are based on the length of the perfluorinated carbon chain that they contain. As the number of perfluorinated carbons increases in the molecule, the water solubility decreases and the better the surfactant properties, but will be more toxic for the environment due to their bioaccumulation in the organisms. In recent years, the interest in PFASs has been growing due to their presence in humans and in wildlife species even from remote locations, which suggests a widespread global distribution of these pollutants. The highest concentration of PFASs has typically been documented in areas with direct industrial emissions. The main purpose of this Doctoral Thesis is to study the distribution and behavior of PFASs in different environmental compartments and to elucidate the interactions among them. In the first study of this Thesis, seventeen PFASs have been analyzed in the water-sediment-plant system along the Dongzhulong and Xiaoqing Rivers in China. The study area is affected by a fluoropolymer facility that belongs to the Dongyue group and is currently one of the major facilities of polytetrafluorethylene production in China. Some studies indicate a presence of PFASs in sediments and soils and these can be a source of pollution for wildlife, and humans. The second study is aimed to evaluate the environmental occurrence of PFASs in sediments, soils, and wildlife in the marine environment surrounding the Chafarinas Islands (South Spain) and the impact on gulls. The third study that composes this Thesis is aimed to evaluate the occurrence and 10-year temporal trend of seventeen PFAS in eggs of two gull species (Larus michahellis and Larus audouinii). These species are used as bioindicators of environmental pollution of Spain. The results of this Thesis show that the fate of the PFASs in the environment is explained by their physicochemical properties and the characteristics of the different study matrices. In freshwater systems, high amounts of PFASs in water and sediments close to the industrial discharge were detected, and concentrations decreased along the river due to dilution. In the water-sediment system, the results suggest that long-chain PFASs accumulated in sediment whereas short-chain PFASs remained in water all along the river. When including plants in the system, PFASs were taken up by plants and translocated in the different plant compartments, and the uptake mechanisms differed among plant species. Floating species show a higher concentration among plants because easily translocate long-chian PFASs direct from the water. Rooted species must compete with the sediment for PFASs uptake. Moreover, long-chain PFASs remain accumulated in the root compartment because of protein affinity while short-chain PFASs are more mobile and can be translocated to shoots. In the marine environment of the Chafarinas Islands, low levels of PFASs detected in soils, sediments, fish, and mussels reflected that the area is not directly impacted by PFASs. In this Thesis we also have estimated the bioaccumulation potential of PFASs, using gulls. We have estimated the intake based on fish-diet in gulls from Chafarinas. We observe that the release of PFOS to the egg is 4.5% of the intake and we provide the basis for using gull eggs as biomonitors. In a final study of this Thesis, we evaluated the presence of PFASs in four main gull colonies in Spain. When comparing gull colonies, eggs from the Ebro Delta and Medes Islands, both located in the North-Eastern Mediterranean Sea, had a similar distribution of PFASs, while in Chafarinas and Atlantic Islands these PFASs were present at lower concentration levels and variability. In the Ebro Delta colonies, concentrations in eggs from L. audouinni were significantly higher than those found in L. michahellis, suggesting that fish diet influences PFAS bioaccumulation. Overall, ∑PFAS decreased in the 10-year study period but for individual compounds, trends were colony-species dependant. This thesis permits to increase the knowledge about the processes that rule the behavior of PFASs in water, sediment, soil, and biota. Also, this thesis demonstrates the advantage of performing systematic monitoring schemes to determine the presence and fate of PFASs in the environment. ; [spa] El objetivo principal de esta Tesis Doctoral es estudiar la distribución y el comportamiento de las sustancias perfluoroalquiladas (PFASs) en diferentes compartimentos ambientales. En esta tesis se analizan diecisiete PFASs en el sistema de plantas de agua-sedimento a lo largo de los ríos Dongzhulong y Xiaoqing, en sedimentos, suelos y fauna de las Islas Chafarinas (Sur de España), y para finalizar se evalúan las tendencias temporales durante 10 años en huevos de dos especies de gaviotas consideradas bioindicadores de contaminación. Los resultados de esta tesis muestran que la distribución de las PFASs en el medio ambiente se define por sus propiedades fisicoquímicas y las características de las diferentes matrices de estudio. En el sistema agua-sedimento, los resultados sugieren que la distribución de las PFASs depende de la longitud de la cadena. Las plantas absorben PFASs y los transfieren a diferentes compartimentos de las plantas. En el ambiente marino de las Islas Chafarinas, bajos niveles de PFASs se detectaron en suelos, sedimentos, peces y mejillones reflejando el poco impacto de estas sustancias en esa área. También se estimó el potencial de bioacumulación de las PFASs en gaviotas y se evaluó su presencia en huevos de diferentes colonias. Los huevos del delta del Ebro y de las islas Medas, ambos ubicados en el Mediterráneo nororiental, tenían una distribución de PFASs similar, mientras que en Chafarinas e Islas Atlánticas tienen a niveles de concentración muy bajos. En las colonias del Delta del Ebro, las concentraciones en huevos de L. audouinni fueron significativamente más altas que las encontradas en L. michahellis debido a diferencias en la dieta. En general, la concentración ∑PFASs disminuyó en el período de estudio, pero para los compuestos individuales las tendencias dependían de las colonias y especies.},

abstract={Abstract ; Fluorhaltige-Koordinationspolymere (FCPs) wurden durch mechanochemische Reaktionen synthetisiert. Die Erdalkalimetallhydroxide, die in ihrem Wassergehalt variieren, wurden als anorganische Quellen verwendet. Die perfluorierten Benzol Dicarboxylsäuren und ihre fluorfreien Analoga wurden als organische Linker verwendet. Die erhaltenen FCPs werden mit den fluorfreien Verbindungen (CPs) verglichen, die unter den gleichen Mahlbedingungen synthetisiert wurden. Der Austausch von Wasserstoff- durch Fluoratome beeinflusst sowohl die thermischen als auch die strukturellen Eigenschaften der FCPs. Letztere werden auch von den Unterschieden der Geometrien und von der Natur der organischen Linker beeinflusst. Während des Mahlprozesses dient Wasser dabei hauptsächlich als Vermittlermedium und zur Stabilisierung der neuen Strukturen. Die Unterschiede in den Kationengrößen zwischen Ca2+- und Sr2+-Ionen wirken sich geringfügig auf ihre Koordination durch die Dicarboxylatanionen aus. Hier kristallisieren Ca- und Sr-Verbindungen zumeist isomorph. Im Gegensatz dazu beeinflusst der große Ionenradius der Ba2+-Kationen die lokalen Koordinationsumgebungen. Die durch Mahlen erhaltenen Verbindungen sind hydratisiert und weisen eine kleine spezifische Oberfläche auf, die nach der thermischen Behandlung zunehmen kann. Die FCPs sind bis zu 300 °C stabil, während die CPs sich erst oberhalb von 400 °C zersetzen. Die hydratisierten Proben wandeln sich beim Tempern in neue dehydratisierte Phasen um. Die Phasenumwandlung kann reversible ablaufen. Zusätzlich wurde der Effekt des Austausches einer Carboxylgruppe durch eine Aminogruppe in einem organischen Liganden untersucht. In den CPs auf der Basis von Anthranilsäure beeinflussen die unterschiedlichen Kationengrößen der Ca2+-, Sr2+-, und Ba2+-Ionen sowohl die Koordinationsumgebung als auch die Dimensionalität der CPs.Die physikalisch-chemischen Eigenschaften der neuen Materialien wurden systematisch durch verschiedene analytische Techniken. ; Abstract ; A series of fluorinated coordination polymers (FCPs) were mechanochemically synthesized using alkaline earth metal hydroxides (M = Ca, Sr, Ba) that vary in their water content as inorganic sources. The perfluorinated benzene-dicarboxylic acids and their fluorine-free analogs were used as organic linkers. The obtained FCPs are compared to their synthesized fluorine-free counterparts (CPs) under the same conditions. The presence of fluorine influences both thermal and structural properties of the resulting FCPs. The latter are also strongly affected by the difference in geometries and nature of organic linkers. Water introduced to grinding acts as a mediator for the milling process and as a reactant for stabilizing the resulting structures. The difference in cation size between Ca2+- and Sr2+-ions has a minor effect on their coordination with perfluorinated or fluorine free benzene-dicarboxylate anions. Here, Ca- and Sr-compounds crystallize isomorphously (an exception was recorded for ortho-phthalate systems). In contrast, the relatively larger size of Ba2+-cation strongly influences the coordination environment. The obtained compounds by milling are hydrated and exhibit small surface areas that can increase after thermal post-treatment. The FCPs are stable up to 300 ˚C. On the other hand, the nonfluorinated CPs begin to decompose above 400 ˚C. The hydrated samples transform into new dehydrated phases upon thermal annealing. The hydrated-dehydrated phase transformation can be reversible. Moreover, the effect of replacement of one carboxylic group by an amino group in an organic ligand was explored. In the CPs based on anthranilic acid, the variations in cation size between Ca2+-, Sr2+-, and Ba2+-ions affect both coordination environment and dimensionality of the resulting CPs. The physicochemical properties of the new materials were systematically investigated applying different analytical techniques.},

abstract={The theoretical background for this thesis is given in Chapter 1. It covers the field of supramolecular chemistry including the phenomena of self-assembly, the history and synthesis of dendrimers, the concept of coordination chemistry and the chemistry of iridium, the history and principles of the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM), and the theory and applications of solid state lighting, especially of the light-emitting electrochemical cells (LEECs). The background chapter is followed by a short introduction to the materials, methods, and instruments used in this thesis (Chapter 2). In the following two chapters, the syntheses of achiral and chiral Fréchet dendrimers (Chapter 3) and the subsequent reactions to the achiral and chiral Fréchet dendronised 2,2'-bipyridine ligands (Chapter 4) are described. Additionally, for most of the compounds presented in these chapters, the monolayer behaviour on graphite was studied with STM. For example, for 3,5-bis(dodecyloxy)phenylmethanol, a very highly resolved image could be detected and detailed considerations of the adopted monolayer could be performed. Chirality was introduced into the molecules for the purpose of altering the preference for a particular conformation, as it has been shown before by L. Scherer[1] that these type of ligands tend to adopt different conformations when adsorbed on graphite. Unfortunately, the measurements of the chiral ligands did not reveal any significant information. Therefore, no detailed discussion of the conformations in the monolayer could be given. Nevertheless, in a monolayer of the diastereomeric mixture of 4,4'-bis(1-(3,5-bis(dodecyloxy)phenyl)propoxy)-2,2'-bipyridine, two clearly differing patterns could be observed which were attributed to different stereoisomers. Chapter 5 deals with the synthesis of dendrons decorated with perfluorinated alkyl chains and their use in the functionalisation of 2,2'-bipyridine ligands. Adsorbed monolayers on graphite of such a ligand were studied with STM. Due to a, apparently, lower propensity to establish monolayers, only few examples of visualised patterns could be observed. The following three chapters cover the synthesis and STM-visualisation of 2,2'-bipyridine-based ligands (Chapter 6), their iridium(III) complexes (Chapter 7), and the use thereof in LEEC devices (Chapter 8). In Chapter 6, simple and more advanced ligands were synthesised and characterised. In the case of the ligands which were functionalised with dendrons presented in Chapter 2, STM studies of monolayers on graphite are discussed. Chapter 7 presents the synthesis and characterisation of iridium(III) complexes obtained from ligands described in the previous chapter. The characterisation comprises measurements of NMR, MS, UV-Vis, photoluminescence, electrochemistry, and, where single crystals could be obtained, their solid state structures. For the complexes bearing dendronised ligands, STM measurements were performed which revealed highly resolved patterns. In the last chapter (Chapter 8), results from LEEC devices fabricated with complexes described in Chapter 7 are shown. The device preparation and the measurement of their characteristics were performed by the group of H. Bolink who kindly allowed the publication of their results in this thesis. It could be shown that for all complexes exhibiting an intramolecular π-π stacking, the stability of their devices was increased dramatically. This thesis has brought together the realms of chemical design with, firstly, studies of the physical behaviour of the envisioned molecules on the surface and, secondly, systematic structural optimisation of iridium(III) complexes for the application in solid state lighting. With the work presented in this thesis, a major breakthrough for long-lived LEECs has been achieved allowing lifetimes of several thousands of hours, an increase of several orders of magnitude compared to the best-performing devices reported to date (see Chapter 1 and Chapter 8).},

abstract={fotografías a color, gráficas, ilustraciones, tablas ; El presente trabajo se basó inicialmente en la caracterización fisicoquímica y microbiológica del agua de uso agrícola en la zona occidental de la Sabana de Cundinamarca, conocida como distrito de riego la Ramada, donde se midieron parámetros como pH, conductividad, temperatura, oxígeno disuelto (OD), demanda química de oxígeno (DQO), demanda biológica de oxígeno (DBO5), carbono orgánico total (COT) y sólidos suspendidos totales (S.S.T.) y parámetros microbiológicos como recuento total de Coliformes Totales y Escherichia coli. Los muestreos se llevaron a cabo en seis puntos diferentes de la Ramada, donde el agua recolectada se analizó en el laboratorio de Ingeniería Ambiental de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Cabe mencionar, que los parámetros microbiológicos en las muestras de agua se analizaron mediante dos técnicas microbiológicas; la primera para establecer un recuento de la población total (NMP/100mL) y comparar los resultados con la normativa colombiana vigente (Decreto 1594 de 1984) para determinar si es apta para riego agrícola, y finalmente la técnica de filtración por membrana (UFC/100 mL) para obtener colonias aisladas de bacterias Gram negativas, que son de interés en este estudio; a las cuales se les determino el perfil de resistencia a antibióticos betalactámicos. Para llevar a cabo esto, inicialmente se realizó un pase de las colonias aisladas en Chromagares (ESBL – CARBA SMART) con el objetivo de seleccionarlas e identificarlas, para que, mediante el uso de herramientas automatizadas, se observará su perfil de sensibilidad. Por otro lado, para determinar la presencia de antibióticos en estas aguas, se realizó una extracción en fase sólida mediante el uso de cartuchos de extracción OASIS HLA (60mg/3cc), para finalmente analizar las muestras mediante metodologías de residuos múltiples como cromatografía líquida acoplada a espectrometría de masas (LC-MS / MS), con el objetivo de cuantificar los analitos en estudio. Teniendo en cuenta este panorama, se decidió caracterizar e identificar si hay presencia de microorganismos resistentes a antibióticos en aguas de uso agrícola del distrito la Ramada, Cundinamarca. En la caracterización fisicoquímica y microbiológica del agua agrícola, se pudo observar que, parámetros como DQO arrojaron resultados que están entre rangos de 101 mg/L a 1276 mg/L para temporada lluvia, mientras que para temporada seca los rangos oscilaron 102 mg/L a 1301 mg/L, en cambio para DBO5 los parámetros oscilaron 34 mg/L a 390 mg/L en temporada lluvia y para temporada seca fueron de 58 mg/L a 830 mg/L. Igualmente, los recuentos de bacterias como E. coli fueron mayores de 5000 NMP Log/100mL en el sitio 4 y sitio 6 en ambas temporadas. Por su parte, se observó como en estas aguas agrícolas hubo presencia de antibióticos como clindamicina, obteniendo valores mínimos de 1.20 ng/L a 42 ng/L en ambas temporadas, azitromicina con valores máximos de 5550 ng/L y trimetropim con rangos entre 82 ng/L a 339.23 ng/L en temporada seca, mientras que para temporada lluvia oscilaron entre los 45 ng/L a 606.48 ng/L y a su vez, como en el sitio 6 el promedio para este antibiótico fue de 1418.24 ng/L, registrando la presencia de fármacos en aguas para fines agrícolas. Igualmente, la identificación mediante técnicas automatizadas arrojó resultados interesantes, encontrando bacterias resistentes a antibióticos betalactámicos como E. coli, y Klepsiella sp., las cuales pueden causar enfermedades y ser relevantes en el ambiente clínico por su importancia para generar resistencia en antibióticos. (Texto tomado de la fuente) ; The present work was initially based on the physicochemical and microbiological characterization of water for agricultural use in the western zone of the Cundinamarca Plains, known as the Ramada irrigation district. Parameters such as pH, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), total organic carbon (TOC) and total suspended solids (TSS) and microbiological parameters such as total coliforms and Escherichia coli count were measured. The samplings were carried out in six different points of the Ramada district, which were: Site 1, Site 2, Site 3, Site 4, Site 5, and Site 6; the collected water was analyzed in the Environmental Engineering laboratory of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. It is worth mentioning that the microbiological parameters in the water samples were analyzed using two microbiological techniques; the first to establish a count of the total population (MPN / 100mL) and compare the results with the current Colombian regulations (Decree 1594 of 1984) and determine if it is suitable for agricultural irrigation, and finally the membrane filtration technique (CFU/100 mL) to obtain isolated colonies of Gram negative bacteria, which are of interest in this study; to which resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was evaluated; these were contacted with Chromagares (ESBL - CARBA SMART) in order to select and identify them, so that, through the use of automated tools, their sensitivity profile could be observed. On the other hand, to determine the presence of antibiotics in these waters, a solid phase extraction was carried out using OASIS HLA extraction cartridges (60mg / 3cc), to finally analyze the samples using multiple residue methodologies such as coupled liquid chromatography to mass spectrometry (LC-MS / MS), in order to quantify the analytes under study. Taking this scenario into account, it was decided to characterize and identify whether there is the presence of multi-resistant microorganisms to antibiotics in waters for agricultural use in the La Ramada district, Cundinamarca. It was observed that in these agricultural waters there was presence of antibiotics such as clindamycin, obtaining minimum values of 1.20 ng/L to 42 ng/L in both seasons, azithromycin with maximum values of 5550 ng/L and trimethoprim with ranges between 82 ng/L to 339.23 ng/L in the dry season, while for the rainy season they ranged from 45 ng/L to 606.48 ng/L and in turn, as in site 6, the average for this antibiotic was 1418.24 ng/L, recording the presence of drugs in waters for agricultural purposes. In the physicochemical and microbiological characterization of agricultural water, it could be observed that parameters such as COD yielded results ranging from 101 mg/L to 1276 mg/L for the rainy season, while for the dry season the ranges ranged from 102 mg/L at 1301 mg/L, on the other hand for BOD5 the parameters ranged from 34 mg/L to 390 mg/L in the rainy season and for the dry season they were from 58 mg/L to 830 mg/L. Likewise, the counts of bacteria such as E. coli were greater than 5 MPN Log/100mL in both seasons, whereas for site 6 the limits exceed values of 7 MPN Log/100mL. Likewise, the identification using automated techniques yielded interesting results, finding bacteria such as E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klepsiella spp., Which can cause diseases and be relevant in the clinical environment due to their importance in generating antibiotic resistance. ; Agrosavia ; Universidad Nacional ; Laboratorio de Ingenieria Ambiental ; Maestría ; Línea de Investigación en Contaminantes Emergentes},

abstract={The present work consists of three parts which deal with the optimization of the properties of polymers finding application as proton exchange membranes in PEMFCs. The focus is the oxidative and photochemical stability of non-fluorinated polymer membranes, as well as the radiation-induced grafting of commercially available fluoropolymer films. The use of the ESR technique is common for the first two parts of the dissertation. The third part comprises the results and discussions of DFT calculations for non-fluorinated and fluorinated fragments. In order to predict hydroxyl radical initiated degradation of new proton conducting polymer membranes based on sulfonated polyetherketones and polysulfones, five non-fluorinated aromatics (4,4'-sulfonyldiphenol, bisphenol A, 4,4'-diphenol, 4,'-dihydroxybenzophenone and sulfonated 4,4'-dichlorodiphenylsulfone) are chosen as model compounds for ESR experiments, aiming at the identification of products of HO· radical reactions with these monomers. Direct photolysis of aqueous solutions of H2O2 was chosen as the source of HO· radicals. In order to distinguish HO· radical attack from direct photolysis of the monomers, experiments were carried out in the presence and absence of H2O2. In the second part of the present work three different electron beam irradiated fluoropolymers - poly(ethylene-alt-tetrafluoroethylene), poly(tetrafluoroethylene-co-hexafluoropropylene) and poly(vinylidenefluoride), as well as their grafting reactions with styrene, 25% styrene in benzene and 25% styrene in ethanol are investigated by means of ESR. Firstly, it was possible to compare the radiation chemistry of the three fluoropolymers that have been irradiated using the same irradiation source, doses and atmospheres. Secondly, it was possible to compare the decay of radicals in the different fluoropolymers by carrying out in-situ ESR measurements in a similar systematic manner during the radiation grafting process, aiming at an understanding of the influence of the irradiation atmosphere and of the diluent. In addition, in the radiation grafting of polymer films with styrene for fuel cell applications it is important to control whether the polystyrene chain is grafted onto a peroxy or a carbon centered radical. Thus thermodynamic properties of small alkyl and alkyl-peroxy radicals are studied to model primary, secondary and tertiary radicals in non-fluorinated and perfluorinated polymers and a comparative DFT study is conducted. Furthermore, it is shown based on DFT calculations that pronounced spin polarization effects lead to unexpected behavior of the hyperfine anisotropy. This is demonstrated by comparison of the parameters of CF3·CF2, both in its fully optimized non-planar and in a forced planar conformation, with those of the analogous non-fluorinated and essentially planar CH3·CH2 radical. A B3LYP or UB3LYP hybrid functional and 6-311+G** or EPR-II basis sets are used, and all calculations are performed with the Gaussian package. ; Die vorgestellte Arbeit setzt sich aus drei Teilen zusammen, die sich mit der Optimierung von Polymeren beschäftigen, die für den Einsatz als protonenleitende Membranen für PEM-Brennstoffzellen geeignet sind. Der Fokus ist die oxidative and photochemische Stabilität von nicht-fluorierten Polymermembranen, ebenso wie die strahleninduzierte Pfropfreaktionen von marktüblichen Fluorpolymeren. Gemeinsam ist den ersten zwei Teilen der Einsatz der ESR- Spektroskopie. Der dritte Teil umfasst der DFT Rechnungen von nicht-fluorierten und fluorierten Fragmenten. Um den Mechanismus der Zersetzungsreaktionen näher untersuchen zu können, wurden für diese Untersuchung fünf nicht-fluorierte aromatische Monomere als Modellverbindungen für protonenleitende Membranen ausgewählt und die entsprechenden Abbauprodukte in Abhängigkeit des pH-Werts über die ESR-Spektroskopie analysiert. Im Einzelnen handelte es sich dabei um 4,4'-Sulfonyldiphenol, Bisphenol A, 4,4'-Diphenol, 4,4'-Dihydroxybenzophenon und sulfoniertes 4,4'-Dichlordiphenylsulfon. Als Quelle für sauerstoffhaltige Radikale wurde die Photolyse von Wasserstoffperoxid eingesetzt. Auf diesem Weg werden hauptsächlich HO·-Radikale gebildet. Die Versuche wurden mit und ohne H2O2 durchgeführt, um den HO·-Radikalangriff von der direkten Photolyse zu unterscheiden. In Teil 2 der Arbeit wurden drei verschiedene elektronenbestrahlte Fluorpolymere - Poly(ethylen-alt-tetrafluorethylen), Poly(tetrafluorethylen-co-hexafluorpropylen) und Poly(vinylidenfluorid), ebenso wie die Strahlungspfropfreaktionen von Styrol, 25% Styrol in Benzol und 25% Styrol in Ethanol auf die oben genannten Fluorpolymere über die ESR-Spektroskopie untersucht. Erstens war es möglich die Strahlenchemie der drei Fluorpolymere zu vergleichen. Die Strahlungsquellen, Dosen und Strahlungsatmosphären waren für alle drei Fluorpolymere gleich. Zweitens war es möglich, die Radikalzerfallsgeschwindigkeiten für die verschiedenen Fluorpolymere zu vergleichen und den Einfluss der Strahlungsatmosphäre und des Lösungsmittels zu verstehen. Beim Strahlungspfropfen mit Styrol von Polymeren für Brennstoffzellenanwendungen ist es wichtig, zu kontrollieren, ob die Polystyrolkette auf ein Peroxyradikal oder ein kohlenstoffzentriertes Radikal gepfropft wird. Thermodynamische Eigenschaften kleiner Alkyl- und Alkyl-Peroxyradikale wurden mittels DFT studiert, um primäre, sekundäre und tertiäre Radikale in nicht-fluorierten und perfluorierten Polymeren zu modellieren. In DFT Rechnungen wurde gezeigt, dass ausgeprägte Spinpolarisationeffekte zum unerwarteten Verhalten der Hyperfeinanisotropie führen. Dies wurde bei dem Vergleich zwischen den Parametern von CF3·CF2 sowohl voll optimiert als auch erzwungen planar mit den Parametern des hauptsächlich planaren CH3·CH2 Radikal bewiesen. Das B3LYP- oder UB3LYP-Funktional mit dem 6-311+G**- oder EPR-II-Basis-Satz wurden verwendet, und alle Rechnungen wurden im Rahmen des Gaussian Programmes ausgeführt.},

abstract={Introduction: The Inflammatory Bowel Disease is characterized by a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and it has two important forms: Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Although the pathophysiology of the disease is mostly unknown, an interaction between immune system, genetics, microbiome and environmental factors seem to be responsible for the disease onset. The role of environmental factors in the pathophysiology of this disease is reinforced if we consider the rapid growth in incidence and prevalence rates of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in areas where the incidence was low as for example Asia. However, the literature on the role of environmental factors in Inflammatory Bowel Disease is reduced and not systematized. Objectives: To study the effect of environmental contaminants on Inflammatory Bowel Disease through a systematic review of the literature. Methods: For this systematic review the methodology "Navigation Guide Method for Grading Human Evidence" was used. The research was carried out in three databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed / MEDLINE). The inclusion criteria used were: research articles with original human data, clinically diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease, quantification of environmental contaminants and study of the association between environmental contaminants and Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Only written articles Portuguese, English, French or Spanish were included. Results: Sixteen studies were included in this systematic review. Of these, 13 studied Inflammatory Bowel Disease in general, 2 studies included only patients with Crohn's Disease and 1 study included only patients with Ulcerative Colitis. The most studied environmental contaminants were sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, perfluorooctanoic acid, aluminum, iron, zinc, copper, titanium dioxide, silicates and endotoxins. We also identified different categories, 4 studies on the effects of air pollution, 3 on the intake of contaminated water, 3 on the effects of diet. Additionally, 2 studies evaluated the serum concentrations of contaminants, 1 studied the impact of exposure to house dust, 2 tried to characterize cells of patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and in one study colitis was induced. Overall, the quality of evidence is moderate to low, and there is inadequate evidence on the effect of environmental contaminants on Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Discussion: In this systematic review, we have identified different classes of environmental contaminants, but studies analyzing the concentration of environmental contaminants in biological matrices are rare. Given the different confounding factors that were not taken into account and the variability between studies it is difficult to draw conclusions on the real role of environmental contaminants on the onset of Inflammatory Bowel Disease or in flares. Conclusion: Based on a moderate to low level of quality, the available evidence gathered in this systematic review is insufficient to access the effects of environmental contaminants Inflammatory Bowel Disease. New epidemiological studies are necessary. ; Introdução: A Doença Inflamatória Intestinal é caracterizada por uma inflamação crónica do trato gastrointestinal e possui duas formas importantes: Doença de Crohn e Colite Ulcerosa. Embora a fisiopatologia da doença seja praticamente desconhecida, as evidências recentes sugerem que esta patologia resulta da interação de diferentes fatores, nomeadamente, imunológicos, genéticos, o microbioma e o ambiente. O papel dos fatores ambientais na fisiopatologia desta doença é reforçado se considerarmos o rápido crescimento nas taxas de incidência e prevalência da Doença Inflamatória Intestinal em zonas onde a incidência era baixa, como é o caso da Ásia. No entanto, a bibliografia acerca do papel dos fatores ambientais na doença inflamatória intestinal é reduzida e não se encontra sistematizada. Objetivos: Estudar o efeito dos contaminantes ambientais na doença inflamatória intestinal através de uma revisão sistemática da literatura. Métodos: Para esta revisão sistemática foi utilizada a metodologia “Navigation Guide Method for Grading Human Evidence”. A pesquisa foi realizada em três bases de dados (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE). Os critérios de inclusão utilizados foram: artigos de investigação com dados originais em humanos, doença inflamatória intestinal clinicamente diagnosticada, quantificação de contaminantes ambientais e estudo da associação entre contaminantes ambientais e doença inflamatória intestinal. Apenas artigos escritos português, inglês, francês ou espanhol foram incluídos. Resultados: Foram incluídos nesta revisão sistemática 16 estudos. Destes, 13 estudaram a Doença Inflamatória Intestinal com referências para a Doença de Crohn e Colite Ulcerosa, 2 estudos incluem apenas pacientes com Doença de Crohn e 1 apenas pacientes com Colite Ulcerosa. Os contaminantes ambientais mais estudados foram dióxido de enxofre, dióxido de nitrogénio, monóxido de carbono, material particulado, ácido perfluorooctanóico, alumínio, ferro, zinco, cobre, dióxido de titânio, silicatos e endotoxinas. Identificamos também grupos de estudo, 4 relacionados com poluição do ar, 3 relacionados com a ingestão de água contaminada 3 relacionados com a dieta, 2 em que as concentrações séricas de contaminantes foram avaliadas, 1 estudou a exposição a pó doméstico, 2 tentaram caracterizar células de pacientes com Doença Inflamatória Intestinal e num estudo tentaram induzir colite. De uma forma geral, a qualidade do corpo de evidência é moderada a baixa, e o efeito dos contaminantes ambientais na Doença Inflamatória Intestinal não foi comprovado. Discussão: Nesta revisão sistemática, identificamos várias classes diferentes de contaminantes ambientais, mas estudos que analisam a concentração real de contaminantes ambientais em matrizes biológicas são raros. Considerando os vários fatores de confundimento que não foram tidos em consideração e a variabilidade entre estudos, torna-se difícil extrair conclusões sobre a influência destes contaminantes no início da Doença Inflamatória Intestinal ou em crises. Conclusão: Com base num nível de qualidade moderado a baixo, a evidência reunida nesta revisão sistemática é insuficiente para avaliar o efeito dos contaminantes ambientais na doença inflamatória intestinal, pelo que novos estudos epidemiológicos necessitam ser realizados.},

abstract={This work aimed to elucidate basic aspects of the influence of chemical structure and surface topography on the surface properties of a polymer material in order to minimize the work of adhesion. End-functionalised aromatic perfluorinated oligo/polyesters have been chosen to clarify effect of chemical structure. Here, the comprehensive investigation of the influence of molecular architecture on processes of fluorine segregation in the topmost surface layer and surface properties of the end-functionalised aromatic perfluorinated linear and branched oligo-and polyesters were performed. It has been shown, that the character of the surface segregation of fluorinated moieties can be influenced by different factors i.e. conditions of preparation of polymer layers (by means of spin-coated and melt films), chemical structure of fluorinated tail and polymer backbone and slightly by molecular weight. Analysis of obtained results allows distinguishing contribution of each factor. Experimentally obtained results showed a good correlation with Scheutjens-Fleer self-consistent mean-field theory extended by Kumar and Koberstein, which corresponds to the surface segregation of various chemical functional moieties located on functional polymers of different architectures. In correlation with a self-consistent field approach, observed results confirmed that polymers with end fluorinated groups are promising for producing of low-energy surfaces.The effect of surface topography has been studied on the example of regular and irregular structured surfaces fabricated from core-shell particles. A simple and effective approach for designing regularly patterned surfaces with specifically designed surface roughness and chemistry using core-shell colloidal particles was demonstrated. The chemistry was varied by covalent grafting of polymer brushes onto silica particles or by chemisorption of fluorosilane. The modified colloidal spheres were organized into closely packed hemispherical hexagonal arrays either by a vertical deposition technique or by sedimentation on slightly inclined coated silicon wafers. In this way, an increase in the vertical roughness was achieved with increasing particle radius, but without changing the Wenzel roughness factor. Controllable variations in the surface chemistry and morphology were used for a systematic study of the wetting phenomenon on regular structured arrays. The regularity and periodicity of particle structures allowed modelling of wetting. The wetting was modelled according to WENZEL, CASSIE-BAXTER, EXTRAND theories as well as minimal and maximal possible contact angles introduced by SHUTTLEWORTH and BAILEY.It has been found that none of these theories completely describe the experimental results for all particle sizes except for the surfaces made from 0.2 Mikrometer large particles. It was revealed that wetting behaviour on fluorosilane modified particles with the diameter of 0.2 Mikrometer is close to the equilibrium contact angle described by WENZEL and CASSIE-BAXTER theories. It has been shown that the deviations contact angle from equilibrium state increase with increasing particle size, decreasing intrinsic contact angle, and increasing solid free energy of the particle ´shell´. This provides the experimental evidence for the theory proposed by JOHNSON and DETTRE. It was revealed that ultrahydrophobic surfaces couldn´t be observed on layers made from regularly packed core-shell particles. Design of fractal irregular surfaces is an appropriate way for preparation of ultrahydrophobic self-cleaning surfaces. It was demonstrated that fluorination is not an obligatory factor for design of water repellent coatings. The obtained results are of essential interest for industrial application.},

abstract={Fully fluorinated polymers (i.e., perfluoropolymers) are a unique class of materials that have shown exceptional separation performance due to their anomalous thermodynamic partitioning compared to typical hydrocarbon polymers. The goal of this work is to elucidate the role of fluorine on gas permeability, diffusion, and sorption through the systematic synthesis and characterization of hydrocarbon, partially fluorinated, and fully fluorinated polymer structures, with a particular focus on the development of structure–property relationships and connecting the behavior of hydrocarbon and fully fluorinated polymers. The effect of the higher sorption selectivity displayed by perfluoropolymers on separation performance was demonstrated through a refinement of upper bound theory. Inclusion of aliphatic fluorine groups resulted in higher diffusion due to increased interchain spacing caused by the larger size of fluorine, while inclusion of aromatic fluorine groups resulted in significantly higher diffusion but also lower diffusion selectivity due to weakened interchain interactions as well as increased interchain spacing. Through the lens of the dual-mode sorption model, increased polymer fluorination affected only the Henry sorption mode through increased amounts of unfavorable equilibrium mixing interactions while the sorption in the Langmuir mode was relatively unchanged. Within the scope of the non-equilibrium lattice fluid model, increased fluorine content resulted in larger unfavorable deviations from ideal mixing, particularly for CH4. Increased enthalpic selectivity with fluorine content was also observed, driving the increase in infinite dilution sorption selectivity. Additionally, an updated group contribution method for estimating fractional free volume in polymers was developed to streamline calculation for any polymer structure. ; Ph.D.},

abstract={Für die Jacobsen-Katsuki-Epoxidierung wurde die Enantioselektivität durch systematische Variation der Reaktionsbedingungen optimiert. Es zeigte sich eine Abhängigkeit von Substrat, Anion des Mn(salen)+-Kations und seiner Koordinationsfähigkeit, Donor-Ligand und seiner Konzentration in der Reaktionslösung, Reaktionstemperatur, Oxidationsmittel und Lösungsmittel. Es wurde gezeigt, dass man die Enantioselektivität und die Ausbeute der Epoxidierungsreaktion der Olefine durch Änderung dieser Parameter stark beeinflussen und optimieren kann. Durch Variation dieser Parameter wurde die Enantioselektivität der Jacobsen-Katsuki-Epoxidierungsreaktion mit 2-Phenylpyridin-N-oxid als Donor-Ligand und 2H,3H-Perfluorpentan als Lösungsmittel im Vergleich zu Literaturpräzedenz um bis zu 10 % verbessert. Zusätzlich wurden perfluoralkylierte MnIII(salen)-Komplexe dargestellt und ihr Effekt auf die katalytische enantioselektive Epoxidierung von Olefinen in unterschiedlichen Lösungsmitteln untersucht. Den Ergebnissen nach ist die Enantioselektivität der Epoxidierungsreaktion mit dem perfluoralkylierten Mn(salen)-Komplex nicht nur stark vom Lösungsmittel abhängig, die Löslichkeit des eingesetzten Donor-Liganden spielt auch eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Verbesserung der Enantioselektivität und Ausbeute der Epoxidierungsreaktion. Die hydrolytische kinetische Racematspaltung der Epoxide nach der Methode von Jacobsen et al. wurde mit dem perfluoralkylierten CoIII(salen)-Komplex getestet. Allerdings wurden dabei keine guten Enantioselektivitäten erhalten. Überdies wurde im Zuge dieser Arbeiten erstmalig ein perfluoralkylierter Salan-Ligand und dessen Komplex mit CrII hergestellt. Im zweiten Teil der Arbeit wurden hypervalente Iod-Verbindungen für Oxidations-, Umlagerungs- und Spaltungsreaktionen untersucht. Es wurde gezeigt, dass Epoxide, 2-Arylaldehyde und Olefine mit in situ gebildeten Lambda3-Iodan-Komplexen (aus einer Mischung von Iodosylbenzol und HBF4 oder BF3•Et2O) zu den entsprechenden Carbonyl-Verbindungen mit guter bis sehr guter Ausbeute umlagern oder oxidativ spalten. Es wurde gezeigt, dass die erste Voraussetzung für die oxidative Umlagerung von Epoxiden eine wasserfreie Reaktionsumgebung ist. Als Spaltungsprodukte der oxidativen Umlagerungsreaktion mit PhIO/HBF4•Et2O (50 % in Diethylether) werden Formaldehyd und Ameisensäure vermutet, die ihrerseits unter den Reaktionsbedingungen weiter bis zu Kohlenmonoxid und Kohlendioxid oxidiert werden. Die Entstehung beider Gase wurde experimentell nachgewiesen. In einer wässrigen Reaktionsumgebung werden die oxidativen C-C-Spaltungsprodukte von Epoxiden als Hauptprodukte isoliert. Für die Epoxidumlagerung mit PhIO/HBF4 wurde ein Reaktionsmechanismus vorgeschlagen. Es wurde eine neue allgemeine oxidative Spaltungsmethode für 2-Arylaldehyde mit in situ gebildeten Lambda3-Iodan-Komplexen ausgearbeitet. Weiterhin wurde die Toleranz unterschiedlicher funktioneller Gruppen in Bezug auf das PhIO/HBF4-Reagenz bei verschiedenen Reaktionsbedingungen untersucht. In Analogie zu bereits in der Literatur beschriebenen Reaktionsmechanismen wurde für die unterschiedlichen Umlagerungs-reaktionen jeweils ein mechanistisches Szenario entworfen. Die Reaktivität der in situ gebildeten Lambda3-Iodan-Komplexe wurde bei unterschiedlichen Reaktionsbedingungen untersucht. Die entwickelten Methoden wurden auf eine Reihe unterschiedlicher Substrate angewendet. Des Weiteren wurde die oxidative Umlagerung und Spaltung von Olefinen mit wenig umlagerungsfreudigen Substituenten mit dem labilen Lambda3-Iodan-Komplex untersucht. Zunächst wurde cis-Stilben als Standardsubstrat in unterschiedlichen Lösungsmitteln verwendet und an diesem Beispiel der Versuch unternommen, die Reaktionsbedingungen zu optimieren. Dieses optimierte Verfahren zur Umlagerung wurde in der Folge auf eine Reihe von Substraten angewendet. Die oxidative Umlagerungsreaktion wurde mit I2/Ag2O für unterschiedliche Substrate in unterschiedlichen Lösungsmitteln untersucht. Dabei wurde eine Methode für die Additionsreaktion von Ag2O und I2 an Olefinen in Anwesenheit von Wasser entwickelt. In wasserfreier Reaktionsumgebung lagern die Cycloalkene unter diesen Bedingungen zu den entsprechenden Cycloalkancarbaldehyden mit guten bis sehr guten Ausbeuten um. Zuletzt wurde MnO2 als Oxidationsmittel für die oxidative Spaltungsreaktionen von 2-Arylalkoholen getestet. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass 2-Arylalkohole zu den entsprechenden Aldehyden mit geringem Umsatz in apolaren Lösungsmitteln oxidativ spalten. Die Methode wird noch optimiert. ; Enantioselectivities and yields of the Jacobsen-Katsuki epoxidation were optimized by systematic variation of reaction conditions. The parameters that affect enantioselectivities and yields most strongly are the geometry and substitution degree of the olefinic substrate, the coordination ability of the anion of the Mn(salen)+ catalyst, the nature of the donor ligand and its concentration in the reaction solution, reaction temperature, oxidizing agent, and solvent. The enantioselectivity of the Jacobsen-Katsuki epoxidation was improved with 2-phenylpyridine-N-oxide as a donor ligand and 2H,3H-perfluoropentane as a solvent by up to 10% compared to established protocols. Furthermore, perfluoroalkylated MnIII(salen) complexes were synthesized and studied regarding their effect on the catalytic enantioselective epoxidation reaction of olefins in different solvents. The results indicate that the enantioselectivity of the epoxidation reaction does not only strongly depend on the solvent used, but the solubility of the donor ligand also plays a crucial role in improving both yield and enantioselectivity. The hydrolytic kinetic resolution of racemic epoxides by the method of Jacobsen et al. was applied using the perfluoroalkylated CoIII(salen) complex. In the course of this work, the first perfluoroalkylated salan ligand and its complex with CrII were synthesized. In the second part of the thesis, the oxidation, rearrangement and cleavage reactions of organic substrates by hypervalent iodine compounds were studied. It was shown that epoxides, olefins and 2-aryl aldehydes rearrange or cleave oxidatively with lambda3-iodane complexes formed in situ (a mixture of iodosylbenzene and HBF4 or BF3•Et2O) to the corresponding carbonyl compounds with good to excellent yields. Oxidative rearrangement of epoxides requires an anhydrous reaction environment. As byproducts of the oxidative rearrangement reaction with PhIO/HBF4•Et2O (50% in diethyl ether) formaldehyde and formic acid are formed, which are subsequently oxidized to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The formation of the two gases was demonstrated experimentally. In an aqueous environment, C-C cleavage products were isolated as major products. A reaction mechanism was proposed for epoxide cleavage with PhIO/HBF4. A novel general method for oxidative cleavage of 2-aryl aldehydes was developed with lambda3-iodane complexes prepared in situ. The tolerance of different functional groups was examined with PhIO/HBF4 under different reaction conditions. A mechanistic scenario was proposed for each rearrangement reaction by analogy to mechanisms already formulated in the corresponding literature. The reactivity of the lambda3-iodane complexes formed in situ was studied under different reaction conditions. The developed methods were applied to a series of different substrates. Furthermore, we studied reactions and cleavage of olefinic substrates with the labile lambda3-iodane complex. For a start, cis-stilbene as a standard substrate was used to optimize the yield of the rearrangement reaction under different reaction conditions. This optimized method was applied to a series of substrates. The oxidative rearrangement reaction of various substrates with I2/Ag2O was studied in different solvents. A method was developed for the addition reaction on olefins with Ag2O and I2 in the presence of water. Under anhydrous reaction conditions, cycloalkenes rearrange to the corresponding cycloalkane carbaldehydes with good to excellent yields. Finally, MnO2 was tested as an oxidant for 2-aryl alcohols. The results showed an oxidative cleavage to the corresponding aldehyde with low conversion in nonpolar solvents. This novel method needs to be optimized in the future.},

Em geral, houve uma associação positiva entre a exposição a estes DEs e a ocorrência da síndrome, e os estudos foram considerados de qualidade metodológica média a elevada. Conclusão: Os dados da presente revisão sugerem a associação entre a exposição a DEs e a ocorrência de SOPC. Entretanto, todos os estudos incluídos foram observacionais e transversais, não sendo possível estabelecer relação de causalidade entre a exposição a DEs e a SOPC. ; Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is of major clinical importance due to its increasing prevalence and its implications, including reproductive, metabolic, and psychological disturbances. Its etiology is complex and multifactorial, involving genetic, environmental and behavioral aspects. Data from observational studies suggest an association between exposure to endocrine dirsuptors (EDs) and the occurrence of PCOS. Objective: To systematically review human observational studies addressing the association between the exposure to EDs and PCOS. Methods: We searched Pubmed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs and Cochrane Library for studies addressing the association between EDs and PCOS from inception until May 2017, with no language restriction. The searched was performed by combining search terms related to EDs and PCOS. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Results: We identified 145 citations and 7 met our inclusion criteria. The studies were cross-sectional or case-controle studies and investigated the association between bisphenol A, organochlorine compounds (polychlorinated bisphenyls and organochloride pesticides), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and phthalates and PCOS occurrence. Overall, the studies indicated a positive association between exposure to EDs and PCOS. Most studies were considered of medium or high methodological quality. Conclusion: This systematic review indicates an association between exposure to EDs and the occurrence of PCOS. However, their cross-sectional design precludes establishing causality between EDs and PCOS.},

abstract={Chapter 1. A strategy for the control of electron density at a metal center is reported, using a remote chemical switch involving second-sphere Lewis acid binding that modulates electron density in the first coordination sphere. Binding of the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 at remote nitrogen positions of a bipyrazine-diarylplatinum(II) complex accelerates biaryl reductive elimination by a factor of 64,000.Chapter 2. The silicon and zinc Lewis acids Si(cat)2 (cat = catecholato), Si(catF)2 (catF = tetrafluorocatecholato), and Zn(C6F5)2 bind to the remote ligand site of a 2,2´-bipyrimidyl–platinum diaryl complex. This platinum complex provides a platform to systematically evaluate electronic and reactivity differences triggered by Lewis acid binding. The electron density of the bipyrimidine ligand is substantially depleted upon Lewis acid binding, as evidenced by UV-vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Biaryl reductive elimination studies allowed quantification of the effect of Lewis acid binding on reactivity, and Lewis acid binding accelerated reductive elimination rates by up to eight orders of magnitude. Kinetics experiments in combination with DFT studies support an unusual mechanism featuring complete dissociation of the bidentate bipyrimidine ligand prior to reductive elimination.Chapter 3. Z-type interactions between bis(perfluorophenyl)zinc and platinum(II) diaryl complexes supported by phenanthroline (phen), bipyridine (bpy), and bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane (dmpe) ligands are reported. In the solid state, there is an unsupported Pt–Zn bond for the phen complex, while the dmpe derivative features additional bridging aryl interactions. The Pt–Zn complexes featuring phen and bpy ligands undergo facile reductive elimination, whereas aryl exchange between Pt and Zn is observed for the dmpe complex.Chapter 4. Bis(perfluorocatecholato)silane Si(catF)2 was prepared, and stoichiometric binding to Lewis bases was demonstrated with fluoride, triethylphosphine oxide, and N,N'-diisopropylbenzamide. The potent Lewis acidity of Si(catF)2 was suggested from catalytic hydrosilation and silylcyanation reactions with aldehydes. Mechanistic studies of hydrosilation using an optically active silane substrate, R-(+)-methyl(1-napthyl)phenylsilane, proceeded with predominant stereochemical retention at silicon, consistent with a carbonyl activation pathway. The enantiospecificity was dependent on solvent and salt effects, with increasing solvent polarity or addition of NBu4BArF4 leading to a diminished enantiomeric ratio. The medium effects are consistent with an ionic mechanism, wherein hydride transfer occurs prior to silicon–oxygen bond formation.},

abstract={Perfluorinated compounds (PFC) are special surfactants which have been used since the 1950s. Their detection in the environment started at the beginning of the 2000s. A lot has to be explored in different fields such as method development, understanding of their environmental distribution, human exposure and their transport to remote areas such as the Artic region. No degradation pathways are known for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), two predominant perfluorinated compounds in the biota and the environment. Their persistence in the environment emphasized the increasing interest of environmental scientists for this class of pollutant. In this work, besides method development, special attention was paid to the characterization of the isomers present in technical mixtures of PFC and in environmental samples. Methodologies and quantification Methodologies based on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with mass spectrometry (MS) with electrospray in negative mode as ionization (ESI(-)) were developed for the analysis of perfluorinated compounds in biota. The extraction procedure consists of an ion pairing extraction using tetra-alkyl ammonium and methyl tert-butylether. Triple quadrupole (TQ) mass spectrometry was better suited for quantification compared to ion trap MS. TQMS enabled the detection of perfluorinated compounds in lower limits of detection (pg range) required for ultra trace analysis. The possibility of systematic errors of the applied methods was investigated. Possible artefacts in the analysis of perfluorinated compounds were identified. One major drawback was the risk of contamination originated by TEFLON®, which can contain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Matrix interference induced also ionization suppression/enhancement and emphasized the still need of method improvement. Moreover, the presence of by-products such isomers and homologues compounds in technical mixtures and in environmental samples make a proper quantification more difficult. Determination of isomer patterns in technical mixture Reversed phase chromatography was used to study the isomer composition of technical PFOS mixtures. Diperfluoromethyl, mono-perfluoromethyl substituted isomers and the linear isomer were identified. Seven isomers present in a technical PFOS mixture could be separated by HPLC. A new derivatization procedure was developed for PFOS and perfluorocarboxylic acids to allow high resolution gas chromatography (HRGC) separation by converting them into iso-propyl esters. An improvement of the separation of eleven PFOS isomers with a maximum of two coeluting isomers was achieved applying HRGC. It offers a promising alternative for the perfluorinated isomers separation in technical mixture. Structural elucidation of PFOS, PFOA and PFOSA monosubstituted isomers was possible applying tandem MS. It allowed the differentiation of up to ten isomers in a technical PFOS mixture. Ion trap tandem MS was more suitable to elucidate the position of the CF3 branching at the perfluorinated chain of monosubstituted PFOS isomers due to more structure-characteristic spectra. Tandem MS spectra of PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA) monosusbtituted isomers were more complex. Only slight differences were observed between their MS/MS spectra due to a different charge stabilization. Currently, the lack of available pure isomer standards limits the isomerspecific analysis. Determination of isomer patterns in technical mixture, water and human blood Finally, the HPLC-MS method for isomer identification in technical mixtures was applied to water and human blood extracts. Isomer profile is indicative of the origin of PFAS contamination. Branched isomers are typical to an electrochemical fluorination (ECF) source, whereas mainly linear structures suggest a telomer source. PFOS detected in human blood collected in Sweden, Australia and United Kingdom was found to be produced by ECF process. However, the sources of PFOA in human were both an ECF and a telomerization processes. Moreover, the comparison of isomer pattern in human blood and water indicated different routes of exposure. The isomers present in technical mixtures were also present in environmental samples. These results showed the potential of isomer pattern for source characterization. This can be useful for risk assessment of humans and other living organisms. However, they could not be completely identified due to insufficient sensitivity. Improvement of the extraction procedure to lower matrix interferences is needed. The development of an alternative GC-MS method combined with a derivatization step could improve separation but not the detection limits due to low derivatization yield. Additional data about isomer patterns in different biota and human bloods from other geographic origins are required for comparison with present results.},

abstract={Chemical energy that hydrogen may generate during combustion and the corresponding electrical energy are interconvertible by means of a fuel cell (FC) and by the electrolysis of water (WE), which allows for the utilization of the complementary nature of these two key energy vectors towards energy sustainability. A proton exchange membrane (PEM) made from an ionomer is commonly employed as the electrolyte in mobile fuel cell applications and in water electrolyzers that require dynamic operability and pressurized product gases. New PEM materials are needed to increase performance, reduce environmental impact, and allow for a more targeted design of PEMFC and PEMWE systems, all of which is in some way limited by the use of the established perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) type ionomers. This work’s focus lies on sulfonated poly(phenylene sulfone)s (sPPS), a unique group of fluorine-free cation conducting ionomers. They are unique in terms of their chemical stability and transport properties, however, typical in terms of their salt-like brittleness in the dry state and extensive swelling at high humidity and in water. To make the unique properties of sPPS available in application, the goal of this work is to take a comprehensive approach to their viscoelastic reinforcement. Therefore, the structure of this thesis entails three related aspects along the process from pure materials to the optimization of robust PEMs for application. The first chapter focuses on the optimization of the intrinsic viscoelastic properties of a particularly suited sPPS (termed S360, with IEC 2.78 meq g-1, EW 360 g mol-1) which lays the groundwork for reliable and systematic further development. To achieve this, relevant properties of S360 are first characterized and viscoelastic shortcomings as seen in water uptake measurements and tensile tests under dry conditions (≤ 30% relative humidity, RH) discussed. The step-growth polymerization of S360 is optimized after finding significant inorganic contamination retained in the established purification process of the widely used monomer sulfonated difluorodiphenyl sulfone (sDFDPS), allowing for the preparation of the ionomer in reproducible high molecular weight. Relevant properties of high molecular weight S360 are characterized and an enhancement of mechanical properties at 30% RH as well as when submerged in water is found. Access to reproducible high quality of S360 enables its first-time use and study as a PEM in a completely fluorine-free WE cell. At 80 °C, record performance amongst fluorine free electrolytes in PEMWEs of 3.48 A cm-2 at 1.8 V is achieved, showcasing the potential of sPPS for application. The second chapter entails the identification and better understanding of a suitable and versatile reinforcement concept for creating robust membranes based on sPPS. To achieve this, the established homogeneously miscible acid-base polymer blends of sulfonated ionomers with poly(benzimidazole) (PBI, and its derivatives PBIO and PBIOO) are discussed in-depth and chosen for later systematic optimization in combination with sPPS. Since the origin of miscibility in PBI blends with sulfonated ionomers is insufficiently described in literature and could facilitate targeted design of new blend components, a model acid-base polymer blend system comprising pyridine-functionalized poly(sulfone) (PSU) is created. Pyridine groups of different basicity tethered to PSU in varying concentration are used to investigate the effect that interpolymer acid-base interaction strength and concentration have on miscibility in blends with 80 wt% S360, as derived from the blend membranes’ cross-sectional SEMs. High mutual compatibility is achieved at high concentration of weak interpolymer interaction, which is interpreted with regards to the observed miscibility in PBI blends. Based on the derived role that hydrogen bonds may play in PBI blends, the difference of interpolymer interaction in solution (during membrane formation) and in the dry membrane is described. This could enable the development of new blend concepts in the future. An exemplary miscible blend that comprises interpolymer hydrogen bonds only in solution but not in the final membrane is shown. The third chapter describes the optimization and balance of properties in the previously described polymer blends with PBIO, following the goal to prepare membranes which can be evaluated in fuel cells and fabricated on a wider scale in order to bring the attractive properties of sPPS into application. To achieve this, S360-blend membranes of varying PBIO content are characterized with regard to conductivity and mechanical properties in various conditions. High mechanical robustness is achieved in S360 blends with 30 wt% PBIO but is accompanied by dramatic reduction of conductivity, due to the charge-consuming acid-base interaction. The findings are translated into blends with fully sulfonated sPPS (termed S220, with IEC 4.54 meq g-1, EW 220 g mol-1) which allows for the creation of membranes that combine mechanical toughness with high conductivity at a ratio of 25 wt% PBIO in S220, making the material suited for production on a commercial casting line and fuel cell testing. Membranes based on S360 that comprise 15 wt% PBIO are designated for further studies in PEMWEs, where membrane requirements differ significantly from that in PEMFCs, highlighting the versatility of the reinforcement approach chosen in this work. Finally, first fuel cell tests of thin spray coated PBIO blend membranes are conducted, and initial durability testing of sPPS-based membranes in fuel cells is possible. Overall, the results presented in this work are strongly interrelated which underlines the importance of comprehensiveness in the successful viscoelastic reinforcement of sulfonated poly(phenylene sulfone)s. Ultimately, the blend membranes resulting from this work can be used as a platform for further development of sPPS-based PEMs in the future.},

abstract={Zur Untersuchung der Orientierungs- und Positionsfernordnung wurde ein Mesogen synthetisiert, das aus einem naphthochionoiden zentralen Bereich und perfluorierten Flügelgruppen aufgebaut ist. Durch Copolymerisation mit einem ebenfalls mit perfluorierten Ketten ausgestatteten Mesogen konnten Polysiloxan-Coelastomere dargestellt werden, die einen breiten Existenzbereich einer smektisch-A Phase besitzen. Ihre Mikrostruktur wurde mithilfe von Röntgenbeugungsexperimenten untersucht. Smektisch-A Seitenkettenelastomere zeigen anisotrope mechanische Eigenschaften. Dehnungsabhängige Untersuchungen entlang der Schichtnormalen zeigten, dass eine kontinuierliche Rotation der Schichten auftritt, die durch ein theoretisches Modell zur Elastizität von smektisch-A Elastomeren beschrieben werden kann. Den zentralen Baustein vieler Mesogene bilden Aromaten, die aufgrund ihrer flachen Struktur dem gesamten Mesogen einen brettchenförmigen Charakter verleihen. Biaxiale Phasen, in denen eine dreidimensionale Orientierungsfernordnung vorliegt, werden ausgebildet, wenn die Rotation der Mesogene um ihre Längsachse im zeitlichen Mittel hinreichend eingeschränkt ist, so dass ihre molekulare Biaxialität erhalten bleibt. Zur Abbildung der Ordnungsparameter wurden die deuterierten Sondenmoleküle Benzol-d6 und Hexamethybenzol-d18 in die flüssigkristalline Matrix eingebracht. Diese Moleküle unterschieden sich in der Genauigkeit, mit der sie den Ordnungsgrad des ersten Direktors der flüssigkristallinen Matrix abbilden, und unterschätzen diesen systematisch. Hingegen zeigten die beiden Sonden vergleichbare Ordnungparameter des zweiten Direktors, wobei biaxiales Phasenverhalten von Benzol-d6 bei niedrigeren Temperaturen beobachtet wurde. Für das Auftreten von biaxialem Phasen-verhalten werden an niedermolekulare Flüssigkristalle bestimmte Anforderungen formuliert. Vergleichende Untersuchungen zur Biaxialität an zwei Elastomeren, die sich in ihrem Aspektverhältnis unterscheiden, zeigten, dass hingegen in Polymernetzwerken biaxiales Phasenverhalten nicht von der molekularen Biaxialität bestimmt wird, sondern an den Glasübergang gekoppelt ist. Damit werden auch die unterschiedlichen Phasenumwandlungstemperaturen, die Benzol-d6 und Hexamethylbenzol-d18 zeigen, verständlich: Der „Weichmacher“-Effekt von Benzol-d6 führt zu einer Absenkung des Glasübergangs. Sondenmoleküle können auch zur Untersuchung der Positionsfernordnung mithilfe von PFG-NMR-Diffusionsexperimenten verwendet werden. Aufgrund der Schichtstruktur wird in hochgeordneten smektisch-A Flüssigkristallen eine Diffusionsanisotropie beobachtet, die durch Defekte in der lamellaren Struktur erniedrigt werden kann. Die Bestimmung der Hauptkomponenten des Diffusionstensors bietet damit eine Möglichkeit zur Charakterisierung der Schichtstruktur. Bei der Bestimmung der Diffusionskoeffizienten traten experimentelle Schwierigkeiten auf, die durch die Verwendung von 2H-DQ-Diffusionsexperimenten gelöst werden konnten: Neben der deutlich langsameren transversalen Relaxation, die eine längere Anwendungszeit des Gradienten erlaubte, konnte bei der Verwendung von 2H-DQ-Kohärenzen von der verdoppelten effektiven Gradientenstärke profitiert werden. Während aromatische deuterierte Sonden in diesen Experimenten keine Diffusionsanisotropie zeigten, wurde mit perfluorierten Sonden eine eine anisotrope Bewegung beobachtet. Lithiumhaltige Polymernetzwerke, die Oligoethylenoxidketten enthalten, sind weitere smektisch-A Systeme, in denen Untersuchungen zur Positionsfernordnung von Interesse sind. Messungen zur Ionenmobilität auf mikroskopischer Längenskala (Dielektrische Messungen) und makroskopischer Längenskala (PFG-NMR-Messungen) zeigten, dass hochgeordnete, defektfreie Domänen mit Größen im Mikrometerbereich vorliegen. Ein Vergleich der Diffusionsanisotropien in niedermolekularen Mesogenen und in Polysiloxannetzwerken, in denen diese Mesogene terminal angebunden sind, belegte, dass die Polymerketten und Vernetzermoleküle die Positionsfernordnung der Mesogene nicht stören. ; To investigate the orientational and positional long-range order in smectic-A side-chain elastomers a new mesogen was synthesised, which consists of a naphthochinoid central moiety and perfluorinated wing groups. Via copolymerisation with a second mesogen, which as well contains perfluorinated chains, polysiloxane coelastomers were obtained. They exhibit smectic-A phase behaviour in a broad temperature range. There microstructure was investigated in X-Ray experiments. Smectic-A side-chain elastomers present anisotropic mechanical properties. Under mechanical deformation parallel to the layer normal a continous rotation of the layers is observed. This behaviour can be described by theoretical models for the elasticity of smectic-A elastomers. Many mesogens are build of aromatic moieties, which due to their flat structure cause a board-like structure of the entire mesogen. Biaxial phases, which posess a three-dimensional orientational long-range order, are observed if the rotation of the mesogens around their long axis is sufficiently hindered to maintain the molecular biaxiality. To determine the order parameters deuterated probe molecules, namely benzene-d6 and hexamethylbenzene-d18 were incorporated into the liquid crystalline matrix. They differ in the reflected order parameter of the principal director and underestimate this value systematically. On the other hand, no difference is obeserved for the order parameter of the second director presented by the two probe molecules. For low molar mass liquid crystals specific requirements have to be fullfilled to exhibit biaxial phase behaviour. Comparing biaxiality experiments in two elastomers, which differ in their aspect ratio, showed that in the case of liquid crystalline polymer networks not the molecular biaxiality but the proximity to the glass transition determines biaxial phase behaviour. Probe molecules can also be used to investigate positional long-range order by means fo pfg-NMR diffusion experiments. Due to the layered structure in highly ordered smectic-A liquid crystals a diffusion anisotropy is observed, which in case of defects in the layered structure decreases. Thus, the determination of the principal components of the diffusion tensor provides a possibility to characterise the layer structure. Experimental problems could be solved by employing 2H-DQ diffusion experiments: apart from the significantly increased transversal relaxation time, which allowed for a longer gradient application, the effective gradient strength doubles. No diffusion anisotropy was observed for aromatic probe molecules, but perfluorinated molecules present anisotropic translational motion. Investigations of positional long-range order are also interesting in Lithium containing polymer networks, which consist of oligo ethyleneoxide chains. Measurements of ionic mobility on macroscopic (pfg-NMR experiments) and microscopic (dielectric experiments) length scale showed that defect free domains of micrometer size exist in this materials. Comparing diffusion anisotropy in low molar mass mesogens and polysiloxane networks, in which the mesogens are attached terminal to the polymer backbone, presented that the polymer chains and crosslinking molecules do not disturb the positional order of the mesogens.},

En este estudio, se realizó una metodología de revisión sistemática con el uso del Software Parsifal, mediante 4 fases: planificación, búsqueda de documentos en las bases de datos, extracción de datos y análisis de datos extraídos. La investigación llevo a un total de 906 artículos donde 169 eran duplicados, quedando 737 artículos a los cuales se realizó un filtro de clasificación por exclusión e inclusión: total artículos seleccionados, aceptados, rechazados y duplicados. De acuerdo al formulario e extracción de datos se utilizaron 222 artículos dando respuesta a las preguntas de investigación que se plantearon en esta revisión sistemática. El desarrollo de esta investigación condujo a la identificación de las propiedades de NPs de GO como agentes biocidas de dos casos de estudio de membranas poliméricas desnudas o puras, (matriz polimérica), las cuales fueron modificadas de la siguiente forma: caso 1, membranas de microfiltración (MF) de poliacrilonitrilo (PAN) modificadas con NPs de plata/oxido de grafeno (Ag/GO) vs membranas de Poli (ácido láctico)/poliacrilonitrilo (PLA/PAN) modificadas con nanocristales de celulosa (NCC) y nanocristales de quitina (NCQ). Para el estudio del caso 2, las membranas de MF de Poli (fluoruro de vinilideno) (PVDF) modificadas con NPs de GO vs membranas de Policaprolactama también llamada (poliamida 6) (PA-6) modificadas con NPs de dióxido de titanio (TiO2). Como resultado a estos dos casos de estudio , para el caso 1 , las NPs de Ag/GO vs NCC y NCQ tuvieron una excelente actividad antibacteriana y antiincrustante con una efectividad en la eliminación de microorganismos con las NPs de Ag/GO y una tasa de reducción del 100% para la E. coli y un 87.6 % para el S. aureus, en comparación con los NCQ y NCC, la efectividad en la eliminación bacteriana con los dos nanocristales fue de un 85% para la E. coli por exclusión de tamaño y un 95% con el uso de NCQ. Para el estudio del caso 2, las membranas de MF de (PVDF) modificadas con NPs de GO vs membranas de PA-6 modificadas con NPs de (TiO2), la respuesta fue una tasa de reducción de bacterias con el uso de las NPs de GO en un 100% para la E. coli y un 99% para el S. aureus y con las NPs de TiO2 fue de un 99.99% para el S. aureus después de 6 h de exposición a rayos UV. ; In recent years, the use of new materials such as graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles (NPs) has been of great relevance in the manufacture of composite polymeric fibers obtained by the electrospinning technique on a micro and nanometric scale for applications in removal of microorganisms present in the water. In this study, a systematic review methodology was carried out with the use of Parsifal Software, through 4 phases: planning, search for documents in databases, data extraction and analysis of extracted data. The research led to a total of 906 articles where 169 were duplicates, leaving 737 articles to which a classification filter by exclusion and inclusion was performed: total articles selected, accepted, rejected and duplicated. According to the data extraction form, 222 articles were used responding to the research questions posed in this systematic review. The development of this research led to the identification of the properties of GO NPs as biocidal agents of two case studies of bare or pure polymeric membranes (polymeric matrix), which were modified as follows: case 1, membranes of microfiltration (MF) of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) modified with silver NPs / graphene oxide (Ag / GO) vs Poly (lactic acid) / polyacrylonitrile (PLA / PAN) membranes modified with cellulose nanocrystals (NCC) and chitin nanocrystals (NCQ). For the study of case 2, Poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) MF membranes modified with GO NPs vs polycaprolactam membranes also called (polyamide 6) (PA-6) modified with titanium dioxide NPs (TiO2) As a result of these two study cases, for case 1, the Ag / GO NPs vs NCC and NCQ had excellent antibacterial and antifouling activity with an effectiveness in the elimination of microorganisms with the Ag / GO NPs and a rate of reduction of 100% for E. coli and 87.6% for S. aureus, compared to NCQ and NCC, the effectiveness in bacterial elimination with the two nanocrystals was 85% for E. coli by exclusion of size and 95% with the use of NCQ. For the case study 2, the MF membranes of (PVDF) modified with GO NPs vs PA-6 membranes modified with NPs of (TiO2), the response was a reduction rate of bacteria with the use of the NPs of GO 100% for E. coli and 99% for S. aureus and with the TiO2 NPs it was 99.99% for S. aureus after 6 h of UV exposure. ; Ingeniero Ambiental},

abstract={Durch gezielte Teilfluorierung und Substitution mit Perfluoralkylketten konnten neue Katalysatoren für die lebende Olefinpolymerisation und die kontrollierte radikalische Polymerisation erhalten werden. An diesen Katalysatoren wurden Polyolefin- und Polystryol-Blockcopolymere hergestellt. Dabei diente die Substitution mit Fluoratomen bzw. perfluorierten Gruppen sowohl der Steuerung der durchgeführten Blockcopolymersynthesen als auch dem Recycling des eingesetzten Katalysators. Im Rahmen der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden Phenoxyiminkatalysatoren für die Synthese von Diblockcopolymeren vom Typ PE-block-P(E-co-P), PE-block-PS und P(E-co-P)-block-PS durch sequentielle Monomerzugabe im Rahmen einer lebenden Polymerisation verwendet. Mit Hilfe dieser teilfluorierten Katalysatoren konnten hochmolekulare Polyolefin-Blockcopolymere sowie Blockcopolymere von Polyolefinen und Polystyrol hergestellt und grundlegende Struktur-Eigenschaftsbeziehungen charakterisiert werden. Ein neuer, hochaktiver Phenoxyiminkatalysator, Bis-(N-(3'5'-di-iod-salicyliden)-2,6-difluor-anilin)-titan(IV)-dichlorid (24), wurde synthetisiert und vollständig charakterisiert. Die Röntgenstrukturanalyse wurde aufgeklärt. Nach Aktivierung mit Methylaluminoxan (MAO) zeigt 24 eine hohe Aktivität bei der lebenden Polymerisation von Ethen. Es können ultrahochmolekulare Polyethylene und propenreiche, statistische Copolymere von Ethen und Propen sowie engverteiltes, ataktisches Polypropylen hergestellt werden. Der Nachweis der lebenden Polymerisation erfolgte durch kinetische Messungen und Analyse der gebildeten Polymere. Eine Serie von Blockcopolymeren des Typs PE-block-P(E-co-P) wurden durch sequentielle Monomerzugabe im Rahmen einer lebenden Olefinpolymerisation an 24/MAO synthetisiert. Es wurde eine systematische Variation der Blocklängen und des Propengehalts durchgeführt. Untersuchungen der Morphologie mit Hilfe der AFM und CRYSTAF-Messungen belegten das Vorliegen von Blockcopolymeren. Experimente an der HT-Gradienten HPLC zeigten, dass weder reines PE noch ataktisches PP während der Synthese der Blockcopolymere als Nebenprodukte anfallen. Dagegen lassen sich Blockcopolymere des Typs PE-block-PS und P(E-co-P)-block-PS nicht in reiner Form, sondern nur im Blend mit PE bzw. P(E-co-P) erhalten. Ein wichtiges Anwendungsgebiet für die synthetisierten Blockcopolymere liegt in ihrer Verwendung als Phasenvermittler in Polymerblends. Bei der radikalischen Atomtransferpolymerisation (ATRP) bewirken schwer abtrennbare Übergangsmetallrückstände Polymerabbau durch Redoxreaktionen verbunden mit Verfärbung. Mit einem neuen fluorigen Biphasen-Katalysatorsystem gelang effizientes Katalysatorrecycling ohne Aktivitätseinbußen nach drei Zyklen. Als geeignetes Reaktionsmedium erwies sich die Mischung Toluol / Cyclohexan / Perfluordecalin (1:1:1, Vol.-%). Verschiedenartige perfluoralkyl-substituierten Liganden wurden für die ATRP in diesem Reaktionsmedium evaluiert. Nur mit dem erstmals für ATRP und inverse ATRP eingesetzten Kobalt(II)-perfluoroctanoat wurden übergangsmetallfreie Polymere erhalten. Die Aktivität des perfluorierten Katalysators ist deutlich höher im Vergleich zu den entsprechenden fluorfreien Systemen. Molmassen, Molmassenverteilungen und Endgruppen wurden analysiert und der Reaktionsmechanismus aufgeklärt. ; New partly fluorinated and perfluoroalkyl-substituted catalysts for living olefin polymerisation and atom transfer radical polymerisation were synthesised. They were used for the preparation of polyolefin and polystyrene block copolymers. The substitution by fluorine or fluoroalkyl chains respectively was the key towards control of block copolymer synthesis and effective catalyst recycling. New phenoxyimine catalysts for living olefin polymerisation were used for the synthesis of diblock copolymers of the types PE-block-P(E-co-P), PE-block-PS and P(E-co-P)-block-PS. It was able to prepare high and ultra high molecular weight block copolymers. Fundamental relations of catalyst structure and polymer properties were analysed. The new phenoxyimine catalyst Bis-(N-(3',5'-di-iod-salicylidene)-2,6-difluoroaniline)-titanium(IV)-dichloride (24), has been synthesised and fully characterised. An Xray structure of the complex has been obtained. After activation using methyl aluminoxane (MAO) it is highly active in living polymerisation of ethylene. Ultra high molecular weight polyethylenes of narrow polydispersity as well as high molecular weight, propene-rich random copolymers of ethylene and propene were obtained. The living character of the polymerisation on 24/MAO was shown by on-line polymerisation kinetics and the dependency of molar mass on polymerisation time. A series of block copolymers of the type PE-block-P(E-co-P) have been synthesised by sequential monomer addition. A systematic variation of the block lengths and the propylene content have been performed. The block copolymers were analysed by NMR, SEC, DSC, TGA and DMA. AFM morphologies and CRYSTAF experiments give good proof for the formation of block copolymers. HT gradient HPLC showed that neither pure PE nor PP are formed during the synthesis of the block copolymers. In contrast to polyolefin block copolymers, block copolymers of the type PE-block-PS and P(E-co-P)-block-PS could not be prepared in pure form. They can only be obtained in a blend with the homo-PE or P(E-co-P) respectively. One major application of the synthesised block copolymers is the role of compatibilizers in polymer blends. Transition metal residues are a crucial problem for atom transfer radical polymerisation. The use of new perfluoroalkyl-substituted catalyst was the key to easy recovery and recycling of the ATRP catalyst. Therefore, the concept of fluorous biphase catalysis was successfully applied to the ATRP processing. The recycled catalyst could be used for two further catalytic cycles without encountering activity losses. A solvent system using toluene / cyclohexane / perfluorodecalin (1:1:1, vol-%) was applied for the polymerisation. Several perfluoralkyl-substituted ligands were studied in ATRP processing. Only when cobalt(II) perfluorooctanoate was used in normal and reverse ATRP it was possible to obtain transition metal free polymers. The activity of the catalyst is remarkably higher in flurous conditions than in non-fluorous media. By analyses of kinetics, end groups, molar masses and molar mass distributions of the obtained polymers the reaction mechanism was undeceived.},

abstract={The aim of the research activity focused on the investigation of the correlation between the degree of purity in terms of chemical dopants in organic small molecule semiconductors and their electrical and optoelectronic performances once introduced as active material in devices. The first step of the work was addressed to the study of the electrical performances variation of two commercial organic semiconductors after being processed by means of thermal sublimation process. In particular, the p-type 2,2′′′-Dihexyl-2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene (DH4T) semiconductor and the n-type 2,2′′′- Perfluoro-Dihexyl-2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene (DFH4T) semiconductor underwent several sublimation cycles, with consequent improvement of the electrical performances in terms of charge mobility and threshold voltage, highlighting the benefits brought by this treatment to the electric properties of the discussed semiconductors in OFET devices by the removal of residual impurities. The second step consisted in the provision of a metal-free synthesis of DH4T, which was successfully prepared without organometallic reagents or catalysts in collaboration with Dr. Manuela Melucci from ISOF-CNR Institute in Bologna. Indeed the experimental work demonstrated that those compounds are responsible for the electrical degradation by intentionally doping the semiconductor obtained by metal-free method by Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4) and Tributyltin chloride (Bu3SnCl), as well as with an organic impurity, like 5-hexyl-2,2':5',2''-terthiophene (HexT3) at, in different concentrations (1, 5 and 10% w/w). After completing the entire evaluation process loop, from fabricating OFET devices by vacuum sublimation with implemented intentionally-doped batches to the final electrical characterization in inherent-atmosphere conditions, commercial DH4T, metal-free DH4T and the intentionally-doped DH4T were systematically compared. Indeed, the fabrication of OFET based on doped DH4T clearly pointed out that the vacuum sublimation is still an inherent and efficient purification method for crude semiconductors, but also a reliable way to fabricate high performing devices.},

abstract={Doctor ; This study investigated solar conversion systems with hybrids catalysts based on titanium oxide. In particular, the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 is a promising method to reduce excess CO2 present in the atmosphere, and simultaneously produce solar fuels (e.g. CO, CH4 and CH3OH) by means of an environmental friendly approach (i.e. artificial photosynthesis). However, the efficiency of the process is still very low (<1%) because CO2 one electron reduction to form CO2•- is highly undesirable. An alternative and more favorable pathway is to reduce CO2 though proton-assisted multiple-electron transfer (PMET). Although its detailed mechanism remains unclear, it is proposed to involve intermediates and different side reaction pathways. Thus, Nafion was introduced on Pd-TiO2 surface for enhancing PMET via keeping high proton concentration in the first work. However, it still demends further studies to improve the photocatalytic efficiency and to utilize the visible light which is abundant in the solar light. Therefore, in the 2nd - 4th work, sensitizers were used for visible light activity. In the second work, introducing thin Al2O3 overlayer on dye-sensitized TiO2 markedly enhances the visible photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production and dechlorination of chlorinated organic compound, CCl4. By measuring TDR spectra of bare TiO2 and Al2O3/TiO2 in slurry, the main role of the alumina barrier layer is proven to retard the charge recombination between the electron injected from the excited dye and the oxidized dye. In the third work, water-soluble [SnIV(OH2)2-TPyHP]6+ (s-SnP) and water-insoluble SnIV(OH)2TPP (ins-SnP) were synthesized and immobilized on SiO2 (hetero-SnP) for enrironmental remediation. In the fourth, s-SnP have been also applied for H2 production. This study reports a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 system for hydrogen production under visible light in which the adsorption of sensitizer on TiO2 is not needed. Although SnP hardly adsorbs on TiO2, hydrogen was successfully produced under visible light. This non-adsorbing sensitizer is liberated from the breaking of anchoring group and dye desorption caused by an extreme conditions during photolysis in aqueous solution. SnP can also improve the price competitiveness comparing with Ru-complexes. 1. Nafion (perfluorinated polymer with sulfonate groups) overlayer on TiO2 was employed for the photoreduction of CO2 in the absence of a sacrificial electron donor. Introducing a thin Nafion overlayer on Pd-TiO2 significantly increased the photosynthetic activity for CO2 reduction under UV and solar light. The main role of the Nafion overlayer is to provide high proton concentration within the layer to facilitate the proton-coupled multielectron transfer reactions and to retard the oxidative degradation of intermediates and products of CO2 reduction. The production of hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, and propane was clearly higher with Nf/Pd-TiO2 than Pd-TiO2. The photosynthetic activity of Nf/Pd-TiO2 catalyst was maintained through repeated cycles of photoreaction, which confirms the stability of Nafion layer. 2. Dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles that were loaded simultaneously with Pt and Al2O3 overlayer (Al2O3/TiO2/Pt) were synthesized and investigated for the photocatalytic activity under visible light. Introducing thin Al2O3 overlayer (~1 nm thick) on dye-sensitized TiO2 markedly enhanced the visible light activities for the production of hydrogen (in the presence of EDTA as an electron donor) and the dechlorination of CCl4. The Al2O3/TiO2/Pt powder was characterized by HRTEM, EDX, and XPS. In agreement with the photocatalytic activity data, the photocurrent collected via electron shuttles on a Pt electrode immersed in an aqueous photocatalyst suspension under visible light was also enhanced in the presence of Al2O3 overlayer, which indicates an enhanced interfacial electron transfer despite the presence of an insulating surface layer. The initial H2 and chloride generation rate increased from 0.4 and 5 μM min-1 on TiO2/Pt to 0.9 and 7.5 μM min-1 on Al2O3/TiO2/Pt, respectively. The visible light activity of the sensitized photocatalytic reactions highly depended on the thickness of the alumina layer and was optimized at a low level of Al loading (Al/Ti atom ratio ~0.01) above which the activity was markedly reduced with thickening the layer. It is suggested that the alumina layer retards the charge recombination between the electron injected from the excited dye and the oxidized dye. The slower charge recombination in the presence of alumina overlayer was confirmed by time-resolve diffuse reflectance (TDR) spectroscopy. 3. Visible light photocatalysis using water-soluble tin porphyrin (s-SnP, [Sn(OH2)2(TPyHP)](NO3)6) and water-insoluble tin porphyrin Sn(OH)2(TPP) (ins-SnP) immobilized on SiO2 (hetero-SnP) was investigated. The visible light photocatalytic activities of s-SnP and hetero-SnP were successfully demonstrated for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) and acid orange 7 (AO7) in water. The visible light activity of hetero-SnP increased with the ins-SnP loading and was saturated above 77 mg/g-SiO2, which corresponded to the homogeneous concentration of [ins-SnP] = 50 μM. It is Q-band of SnP (500-650 nm) that is photocatalytically active under visible light, not Soret band (420-430 nm) whose absorption intensity is much higher. When applied to the degradation of 4-CP and AO7, hetero-SnP was particularly stable and could be used repeatedly without losing the activity whereas the activity of s-SnP was gradually reduced with repeated uses. The photocatalytic degradation reactions of 4-CP, AO7, and other organic substrates were systematically studied to show that the operating mechanisms are very different depending on the kind of substrates. The properties and activities of s-SnP and hetero-SnP as a visible light photocatalyst were investigated in various ways and discussed in detail. 4. Hydrogen was successfully produced under visible light irradiation in a tin porphyrin (SnP)-sensitized TiO2 system in the wide pH range (pH 3-11) although SnP hardly adsorbs on TiO2. The number of H2 produced in the SnP/TiO2 system after 9 h irradiation corresponds to the turnover number of 410. The apparent photonic efficiency for H2 evolution was estimated to be 35% with the monochromatic radiation of 550±10 nm. The photochemical production of hydrogen is mediated through the formation of the π-radical anion (SnP•-) that subsequently transfers electron to TiO2. The photogenerated SnP•- was monitored by transient absorption spectroscopy and its lifetime is long enough to survive the slow diffusion from the solution bulk to the TiO2 surface, which makes the adsorption of SnP on TiO2 not required for hydrogen production. This is clearly contrasted with the common ruthenium complex-sensitized TiO2 system where the adsorption of the sensitizer complex is essentially required and the hydrogen production is limited to the acidic condition where the adsorption of the sensitizers on TiO2 is allowed. The photocatalytic activity of SnP was mainly attributed to the Q-band (500-650 nm), not the Soret band (420-430 nm) of which absorption intensity is much higher.},

abstract={Ionic liquids (ILs) constitute a highly tunable class of novel materials that offers a unique property combination for a large variety of high-performance applications. As there are a vast number of possible ILs accessible for the implementation in advanced technologies, the knowledge about their synthesis, physicochemical properties and microscopic interactions that determine the macroscopic behavior is of vital interest. The introduction of fluorinated alkyl groups in ILs significantly alters their properties depending on the chain length in different beneficial ways. The aim of this thesis was the systematic investigation of the synthesis of novel ILs with perfluorinated alkyl groups, the resulting macro- and microscopic properties (transport characteristics, wetting behavior and bulk structuring) as well as possible applications that could benefit from these fluorinated ILs (FILs). The introduction of elongated perfluorocarbon segments in the ILs’ cation or anion resulted in increased melting points and viscosities as well as an altered nanostructure through pronounced structuring in the bulk liquid. Furthermore, the FILs showed a significantly altered wetting behavior on different surfaces and it was demonstrated that a highly fluorinated representative could be used in thermoregulated fluorous biphasic catalysis for the retention of a palladium catalyst. In contrast to this, anions containing trifluoromethyl groups showed improved transport properties due to increased charge delocalization. ; Ionische Flüssigkeiten (ILs) sind eine vielseitig abstimmbare neue Materialklasse, die eine einzigartige Eigenschaftskombination für ein großes Spektrum an Anwendungen bietet.

Die Einführung langer Perfluorokohlenstoff-Ketten in Kation oder Anion von ILs führte zu höheren Schmelzpunkten und Viskositäten sowie einer veränderten Nanostruktur durch die ausgeprägtere Bulk-Strukturierung. Darüber hinaus zeigten die FILs ein deutlich verändertes Benetzungsverhalten auf verschiedenen Oberflächen und es wurde demonstriert, dass ein hochfluorierter Vertreter zur Immobilisierung eines Palladium-Katalysators in einer thermoregulierten fluorigen Zweiphasenkatalyse genutzt werden kann. Im Gegensatz dazu zeigten Anionen mit Trifluormethylgruppen verbesserte Transporteigenschaften durch stärkere Ladungsdelokalisation.},

abstract={Semifluorinated alkanes self-assemble spontaneously into uniform nanometer-sized domains on water. The order of such “surface micelles” at the air/water interface is achieved by the counter balance of attractive and repulsive interactions. In this thesis, the viscoelastic properties of semifluorinated alkane monolayers are investigated by using interfacial shear and dilational rheology under oscillatory strain. The obtained response function implies a predominantly elastic character of the monolayers, suggesting repulsive interactions between the surface micelles. Both the structure and the form factor of the surface micelles are determined by the quantitative analysis of grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering data. A systematic variation of the length and of the number of fluorocarbon and hydrocarbon chains unravel how a subtle change in the molecular structure modulates the size, shape and correlation of the surface micelles. A promising application of semifluorinated alkanes are contrast agent microbubbles for sonographic imaging. This thesis further shows that perfluorohexane vapor - commonly used to increase the lifetime of microbubbles - reduces the elasticity of the monolayers from semifluorinated alkanes whereas their structure is not influenced. The obtained results contribute to the fundamental understanding of the formation and mechanics of mesoscopic molecular assembly at the interface.},

abstract={The field of organic photovoltaics (OPV) has been attracting great scientific attention over the last few years. New fields of applications are feasible as OPVs are lightweight, flexible and have the potential for truly low fabrication cost. At present, so-called bulk heterojunction structures based on blends of a conjugated polymer as electron donor and a soluble fullerene derivative as acceptor represent the OPV material system with the highest power conversion efficiency reported until now. This thesis addresses several critical parameters in the processing issues of polymer:fullerene based organic solar cells. Primarily, a sedulous investigation concerning deposition parameters of an electron blocking-hole transporting interfacial layer (Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) [PEDOT:PSS]) was performed. The conductivity and thickness effect of the layer on overall device performance was analyzed. Then the optically active layer consisting of the reference poly-3-hexylthiophene and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) blend material system was investigated. Parameters such as composition ratio, layer thickness and annealing conditions were examined in order to achieve the reference organic solar cells for the newly founded Molecular Electronics and Photonics research unit with optimized and highly reproducible power conversion efficiency (PCE). The processing steps described in this thesis yielded P3HT:PCBM devices with repeatable and consistent PCE performance higher than 3 % and now the process is used as a standard method to provide the reference solar cells in the Molecular Electronics and Photonics laboratory. During the processing steps of P3HT:PCBM, a 21 kink in the shape of the current density/voltage (J/V) characteristics was observed. Devices of different ratios of P3HT to PCBM were fabricated and sent for further studies at the Jaume University in Spain. The s-shaped characteristics were explained by capacitance measurements related to the presence of defect bands exhibiting Gaussian shape located at E approximate to 0.38 eV above the highest occupied molecular orbital level of the P3HT. After establishing the reference process for P3HT:PCBM based solar cells new synthesized conjugated polymers donors were investigated in terms of their potential for organic solar cell applications. A perfluoro poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)- alt-5,5- (4’,7’-di-2-thienyl-2’,1’,3’-benzothiadiazole)] (APFO-3) derivative and different fluorescent boron-dipyrromethene conjugated polymers (BODIPY) were characterized. Absorption and photo luminescent spectra as well as current density characteristics of the fabricated photovoltaic devices were compared to commercially available materials. Despite the exhibited low mobility and PCE values (in the range of 0.2-1.2 %), some of the newly synthesized polymers, like PBT and PBTT, are promising electron donors for further synthetic trials due to their high absorption coefficient and high photovoltage (over 1 V). Furthermore a systematic study of inkjet printing processing parameters for organic solar cells applications was followed. Optimum parameters for inkjet printing active layer were firstly identified, proving that the viscosity of the inkjet formulation, substrate temperature, drop spacing and the height of the droplet in relation to the surface are critical factors to achieving high quality inkjet-printed polymer-fullerene 22 based active layers. The last part of the chapter focuses on replacing the expensive and brittle indium tin oxide (ITO) with an inkjet printed silver grid architecture. Investigation of an inkjet-printed silver nanoparticle grid combined with different conductivity PEDOT:PSS was performed. An ultimate control of the design requirements of current collecting grid based on the proposed inkjet-printed process to accurately control the uniformity and dimensions of the silver nanoparticle based grid was achieved. The performed measurements revealed higher transparency of the printed Ag grid when compared to different thicknesses of ITO. As a result a record power conversion efficiency of 1.96 % is achieved for ITO-free P3HT:PCBM based organic solar cells using the combination of PEDOT:PSS/inkjet printed nanoparticles based current collecting grids. ; Costas N.

abstract={Diese Dissertation versucht einen Beitrag zu leisten zur Entschlüsselung der komplexen und subtilen Beziehung zwischen Substrat-Molekül Wechselwirkung und intermolekularer Wechselwirkung. Zu diesem Zweck wird die Adsorption zweier repräsentativer organischer Moleküle, Pentazen (PEN) und Perfluoro-Pentazen (PFP), auf mehreren Substraten mit verschieden starker Wechselwirkung untersucht. Ein sehr vielseitiges Substrat ist hierbei die Cu(110)-Oberfläche, welche durch Adsorption von Sauerstoff in ihrer Reaktivität und Wechselwirkung angepasst werden kann. Durch die Verwendung eines neu entwickelten Tieftemperatur-Rastertunnel-Mikroskops (LT-STM) und oberflächenphysikalischen Standard-Messtechniken wie niederenergetische Elektronenbeugung (LEED) sowie der Kombination dieser Methoden mit Reflektions-Differenz-Spektroskopie (RDS), eine sehr vielseitige Methode zur Untersuchung der anisotropen optischen Eigenschaften, ist es möglich eine systematische Studie der Energetik, Wechselwirkung und der Ordnung auf der molekularen Ebene durchzuführen. Zuerst wurde die Entwicklung der optischen Eigenschaften innerhalb der ersten Monolage von PEN und PFP auf Cu(110) untersucht und mit der entsprechenden Adsorptionsstruktur verglichen. Für PEN konnte eine starke Molekül-Substrat Wechselwirkung festgestellt werden, welche mit einer Hybridisierung von Molekülorbitalen mit Oberflächenzuständen einher geht. Im Gegenteil dazu wurde für PFP eine schwache Wechselwirkung festgestellt. Weiters wurde die thermische Stabilität solcher PFP-Monolagen auf Cu(110) untersucht. Dabei zeigte sich dass PFP-Moleküle auf Cu(110) einer Dissoziations-Reaktion ausgesetzt sind, welche bei einer Temperatur von etwa 400K stattfindet. PEN Moleküle welche auf der Cu(110)-(2x1)O rekonstruierten Oberfläche adsorbiert wurden, durchlaufen einen voll reversiblen Phasenübergang von einer 2D Gasphase zu einer 2D kondensierten Phase. Dieser Phasenübergang kann entweder durch Ändern der Temperatur oder der Bedeckung initiiert werden, und steht in Verbindung mit einer 2D Kondensationswärme von H =84meV. Ein sehr ähnlicher Phasenübergang konnte auch für PFP Moleküle in der zweiten Monolage auf Cu(110) festgestellt werden. Die erste Monolage dient hierbei als Entkopplung welche die Wechselwirkung der Moleküle in der zweiten Lage deutlich abschwächt. Die dabei gemessene Enthalpie war vergleichbar, aber leicht höher als für PEN: H = 105meV. Zuletzt wurde die Adsorption von PEN auf der stark korrugierten Cu(110)-c(6x2)O Oberfläche untersucht. Dabei konnte ein sehr selektiver Adsorptionsmechanismus der Moleküle festgestellt werden wo die Moleküle nur auf bestimmten, genau definierten Adsorptionsplätzen liegen. Weiters konnte ein Durchbiegen der Moleküle über dem Adsorptionsplatz entdeckt werden, welcher zu einem komplexen Aussehen und Kontrast der Moleküle in den STM Messungen führt. ; This thesis makes an effort to unravel the intricate relationship between substrate-molecule interactions and intermolecular interactions. A systematic approach is presented where the adsorption of two prototype organic semiconductor molecules, namely pentacene (PEN) and perfluoro-pentacene (PFP), is studied on several substrates with different interaction strengths. A versatile substrate in this regard is the Cu(110) surface, whose reactivity and coupling strength can be tuned by exposing the surface to varying amounts of oxygen. By employing a newly developed low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope (LT-STM) and standard techniques such as low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and combining these methods with reflectance difference spectroscopy (RDS), a versatile tool for studying the anisotropic optical properties, a systematic study of the energetics, interactions and ordering on the molecular scale is presented. At first, the evolution of the optical properties of 1ML PEN and PFP on Cu(110) were investigated and related to their thin-film interface morphology. For PEN, a strong molecule-substrate interaction is observed which involves a hybridization of molecular orbitals with Cu surface states. For PFP, a distinctly different behavior was observed, where a weak molecule-substrate interaction is observed. Also the thermal stability of PFP monolayers on Cu(110) was observed, and it was found that the adsorbed molecules undergo a dissociation reaction upon heating to approx. 400K. For PEN adsorbed on the Cu(110)-(2x1)O reconstructed surface, a reversible phase transition from a 2D gas phase to a 2D condensed phase could be observed. This phase transition can be either initiated by temperature or coverage and is driven by a small 2D heat of condensation of H =84meV. A very similar phase transition could be observed for PFP molecules deposited on top of 1ML PFP on Cu(110). Hereby, the organic-inorganic interface acts as a decoupling layer which significantly reduces the molecule-substrate interactions. This phase transition is found to be driven by a slightly higher enthalpy of H = 105meV. Lastly, the adsorption of PEN on the highly corrugated Cu(110)-c(6x2)O reconstructed surface was studies, where a selective adsorption of PEN molecules on top of the super-Cu atoms was found. The interaction with the specific adsorption site results in a bending of the molecule, giving rise to a complex appearance and shape in the STM and STS results. ; eingereicht von: Johannes Gall ; Zsfassung in dt.

Die vorliegende Arbeit umfasst die Synthese neuer lateral substituierter Bolaamphiphile und eine eingehende Charakterisierung ihrer flüssigkristallinen Eigenschaften mittels Polarisationsmikroskopie, DSC und röntgenographischer Methoden. Sowohl die Größe des lateralen Substituenten als auch dessen chemische Natur (Alkyl-, Perfluoralkyl- und Carbosilangruppen) wurde systematisch variiert. Die synthetisierten Verbindungen zeigen eine große Bandbreite neuer komplexer Mesophasen. Von besonderem Interesse sind dabei kolumnare Phasen mit Zylinderstrukturen, korrelierte und nicht korrelierte lamellare Phasen sowie kubische Mesophasen mit core-shell Morphologie. ; The investigation of the mesomorphic properties of low molecular weight block molecules has become a field of increasing interest in the last few years. Rigid bolaamphiphiles with flexible lateral chains represent an important class of such compounds. The combination of amphiphilic self-organization with the driving force for parallel arrangement provided by rigid segments leads to the formation of novel exciting complex mesophase structures. The subject of this work is the synthesis of novel lateral substituted bolaamphiphilic molecules and the characterization of their liquid crystal properties by means of polarizing microscopy, DSC and X-ray scattering. The size of the lateral substituents as well as their chemical nature (alkyl, perfluoroalkyl and carbosilane units) was changed systematically. The synthesized compounds show a wide variety of new complex mesophases. Of particular interest are: columnar phases with cylinder structures, correlated and non-correlated lamellar phases as well as cubic phases with core-shell morphology. ; von Marko Prehm},

abstract={Thesis: Ph. D. in Biological Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Chemistry, 2018. ; Cataloged from PDF version of thesis. ; Includes bibliographical references. ; The intracellular delivery of functional macromolecules remains an outstanding challenge in biomedicine. While small molecules can diffuse through the plasma membrane, many large therapeutic molecules are not internalized to an appreciable extent. One strategy to improve cell uptake involves linking the molecule of interest to a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). CPPs are widely employed to enhance macromolecule delivery, with hundreds of different peptides and modifications reported to improve cellular uptake. In this thesis, CPPs were systematically investigated and chemically altered to facilitate the delivery of antisense oligonucleotides. To accurately compare the existing CPPs, 64 CPP sequences were synthesized, conjugated to oligonucleotides, and assayed for delivery. These CPPs showed a range of effectiveness, with some CPPs hindering the delivery of oligonucleotide cargo and others leading to a 10-fold increase in oligonucleotide activity. To help identify which CPPs might be valuable for oligonucleotide delivery specifically, a computational model was developed to predict, de novo, whether or not a CPP will be effective. When experimentally validated, this model successfully predicted which sequences would improve oligonucleotide delivery greater than 3-fold. Multiple strategies were employed to improve CPP effectiveness. First, arginine-rich CPPs were chemically modified with perfluoroarenes. Cyclic and bicyclic CPPs were synthesized by linking multiple cysteine residues together with a perfluoroarene. After oligonucleotide conjugation, these peptides led to a 14-fold increase in delivery. Second, two different CPPs were combined into one long chimeric sequence. The CPP chimeras were highly active, leading to a 20-fold increase in oligonucleotide delivery. Third, the idea of combining multiple CPPs led to the development of a method for the rapid synthesis combinatorial peptide conjugates. Using the judicious choice of bioconjugation chemistry, highly-active modular constructs were synthesized that contain three peptides linked to one oligonucleotide. In addition to CPPs for oligonucleotide delivery, one section of this thesis employed perfluoroaryl macrocyclic peptides to address the challenge of peptide delivery across the blood-brain barrier. An additional section developed a new peptide conjugation strategy that uses palladium-peptide oxidative addition complexes as solid, storable, and water-soluble reagents for bioconjugation. ; by Justin Mahoney Wolfe. ; Ph.

D. in Biological Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Chemistry, 2018. ; Cataloged from PDF version of thesis. ; Includes bibliographical references. ; Many nucleic acids, peptides, and small molecules struggle to become clinically viable therapeutics as a result of poor delivery. Biological barriers such as the plasma membrane and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) contribute to this challenge as they can limit the passage of macromolecules. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) that interact with membranes can improve the uptake of macromolecules across biological barriers. Here we explore methods for the peptide-mediated delivery of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and chemotherapeutics. First, we address the issue that the optimal peptide sequence for the delivery of a macromolecular cargo is often context-dependent and specific to that cargo. With one class of ASO, we develop a paradigm that combines systematic screening of known CPPs in a functional assay for ASO delivery with machine learning methods. Using our computational model, we identify five novel sequences that increase ASO activity at least three-fold. Next, we demonstrate that combining CPPs of different classes generates chimeric peptides with synergistic effects on ASO delivery. These chimeras improve ASO activity twenty-fold, which is greater than any literature-reported sequence. Then, we examine peptide cyclization with perfluoroaryl-cysteine SNAr chemistry to improve the stability and delivery of peptide-ASO conjugates. We extend our SNAr chemistry to the synthesis of arginine-rich bicyclic peptides, which are more stable to proteolysis than single cycles. Both perfluoroaryl cyclic and bicyclic arginine-rich peptides improve ASO activity fourteen-fold. Consequently, we demonstrate that peptide cyclization with perfluoroaryl-cysteine SNAr chemistry enhances the ability of peptides to cross the BBB. We prepare macrocyclic analogues of both a CPP and a therapeutic peptide. We show that a subset of the macrocycles cross the BBB in both a cellular spheroid model of the BBB, as well as after intravenous injection in mice. Finally, we conjugate a platinum (IV) prodrug of the chemotherapeutic cisplatin to a brain-penetrating perfluoroaryl macrocycle and show that the amount of platinum in the mouse brain is fifteen-fold greater than cisplatin after five hours. In summary, we explore strategies to improve the peptide-mediated delivery of ASOs and small molecule chemotherapeutics across biological barriers. In the future, we envision extending these approaches to other macromolecular cargos of therapeutic interest. ; by Colin MacLaine Fadzen. ; Ph. D. in Biological Chemistry},

abstract={This thesis primarily covers a systematic assessment of quantum chemical methods to predict accurate 19F NMR shifts for fluoroarenes and magnetic exchange coupling constant (J) in organic spin dimers which are basic building blocks for rational designing of organic magnetic materials. One of the most important goals in chemistry is to design and synthesize molecules with optimum properties. This thesis is divided into two parts: the first part comprises of a systematic effort to find an inexpensive quantum chemical method to predict accurate 19F NMR chemical shifts (within an accuracy of 2 ppm) for perfluoraromatics. Essentially, these strenuous efforts have been devoted to find best DFT functional and basis set combination to predict accurate 19F shifts. In addition,the influence of geometrical parameters, solvents, chemical environment was also analyzed. Various correction approaches were tested to correct the calculated shifts. The influence of various functionals and basis sets was also analyzed on the correction efficiency of an individual scheme. All the NMR calculation methods already being used and correction approaches were verified to predict shifts of three different fluorine-substituted molecular sets. These structure sets include fluorobenzenes, substituted benzenes and fluorine substituted aromatic fused rings (e.g. fluorine substituted anthracene). In the second part of this thesis, we investigated the accurate prediction of magnetic exchange couplings (J) for organic spin dimers using quantum chemical methods. We analyzed the performance of various DFT methods and various post-HF methods, such as the CASSCF, CASPT2, MSTDISD, DDCI1, DDCI2, DDCI3, and FCI to predict magnetic exchange couplings (J). Overview of the Chapters: Chapter 1, presents a brief theoretical introduction to the Schrödinger equation and its application in quantum mechanical calculations, the Hartree-Fock approximation, basis sets, electron correlation energy, and density functional theory (using pure and hybrid functionals). In chapters 2 and 3, an introduction is given for quantum chemical approaches used to calculate NMR parameters and magnetic exchange coupling constants. We discuss an effective spin Hamiltonian, the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian (BPH), chemical shielding tensor and total energy relationship, measuring of the NMR spectra, and different techniques to deal with gauge origin problem. In addition, the theoretical background of magnetic exchange coupling constant calculation for spin dimers, the Heisenberg-Dirac-van-Vleck Hamiltonian (HDVV) and the Noodelman's broken-symmetry approach for calculating J values are briefly discussed. Chapter 4, presents a benchmark study of various DFT functionals and basis sets to calculate accurate C-F bond lengths and 19F chemical shifts. High-resolution NMR spectral data of complex molecules are often difficult to interpret. Great scientific efforts have been devoted to search for a computational approach to interpret experimental NMR data. Quantum chemical methods such as the CCSD(T) method offer high accuracy in calculation of NMR parameters but being computationally too demanding they cannot be applied to large chemical systems. On the other hand, density functional theory (DFT) is achieving a steady progress among diversity of computational techniques. An accuracy within 2 ppm deviation from the experimental values in 19F chemical shifts can be achieved if the NMR calculation is performed using accurate equilibrium geometries, GIAO is used to tackle gauge origin problem and electron correlation is properly treated by employing a high level of theory (e.g. CCSD (T)/cc-pVQZ). We found that the calculation of 19F shielding tensors with the density-functional theory does not provide any noticeable improvement over the HF method. Post-HF theory demands too much computational resources that makes them impossible to use for large systems [35] . We found that a quantitative prediction of NMR shifts can be made as the errors introduced by theoretical methods are cancelled out while calculating shifts. Various benchmark studies in this thesis show that 19F chemical shifts calculated for perfluoraromatics with the M06-L, BHandH, BHandHLYP in combination with the 6-311+G (2d,p) basis set are within 4 ppm deviation from the experiments. Furthermore, we noted that NMR calculations on accurate C-F (e.g. PBE/6-311G (d, p)) bond lengths does not show any improvement if the NMR calculation and optimization are performed at the same level of theory. A significant improvement can be achieved on calculated 19F NMR shifts, if some correction schemes are used. In chapter 4 we discuss various correction schemes applied to correct the calculated 19F chemical shifts. A multi-standard approach (MSTD) was used to minimize the error that may occur due to the difference in the nature of the reference compound and test molecules [122]. We propose another approach to correct shielding constants which is the reference corrected approach. This approach makes a correction similar to the MSTD. We also tested a Linear Regression Correction Approach and we noted that this is the best approach amongst all. This is found to be less dependent on the theoretical method. We use conformation averaging corrections to correct the calculated shifts[126]. .},

In particular, we find that a proper annealing process can significantly reduce the anomalous ion diffusion impedance and improve the impedance properties of MWCNT/polymer nanopillars in the electrolyte. ; Master of Science ; Conducting vertical nanopillar arrays can serve as three-dimensional nanostructured electrodes with improved performance for electrical recording and electrochemical sensing in nano-bioelectronics applications. However, vertical nanopillar-array electrodes made of inorganic conducting materials by conventional nanofabrication approach still faces challenges in high manufacturing costs, poor scalability, and limited choice of carrier substrates. Compared to conventional nanofabrication approaches, nanoimprint lithography exhibits unique advantages for low-cost scalable manufacturing of nanostructures on both rigid and flexible substrates. Very few studies, however, have been conducted to achieve the scalable nanoimprinting fabrication of conducting nanopillar arrays made of MWCNT/polymer nanocomposites. Here, I'm reporting a new type of conducting nanopillar arrays composed of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) doped polymeric nanocomposites, which can be manufactured over the wafer-scale on both rigid and flexible substrates by direct nanoimprinting of the perfluoropolyether nanowell-array template into uncured MWCNT/polymer mixtures. We find that the nanoimprinted conducting nanopillar arrays can possess appealing electrical properties with a high DC conductivity (~4 S/m) and a low AC electrochemical impedance (~104 at 1000 Hz) in the physiologically relevant electrolyte solutions (1X PBS). Furthermore, I've conducted a systematic equivalent circuit modeling analysis of measured EIS results to understand the effects of the MWCNT ratios and the annealing temperatures on the impedance of different bulk and interfacial circuit components for MWCNT/polymer nanopillar arrays in the electrolyte.},

abstract={Abstract:This thesis has as its aim the study of polyfluoroalkyl-substituted five-membered ring heterocycles as potential fluorous surfactants.The first part concerns the preparation of a selected number of new and previously reported polyfluoroalkylated pyrazoles (1,2-diazoles), 1,2,3-triazoles, and tetrazoles with systematic variations in their substituents. The 1,2,3-triazoles were synthesized from partner azides and alkynes using dipolar cycloaddition reactions with good regioselectivity. The tetrazoles were synthesized from azides and nitriles in a similar dipolar cycloaddition, but the reaction was less facile. Alkylation under Mitsunobu conditions gave improved yields and regioselectivity. A preliminary series of pyrazoles was also synthesized through a regioselective cyclocondensation of hydrazines and polyfluorinated 1,3-diketones. The synthesis unexpectedly also provided a number of intermediate amino alcohols. Unfortunately, the regioisomers could not be separated, so the isomers could not be assessed for their surface active properties.The surfactant character of the polyfluoroalkylated 1,2,3-triazoles and tetrazoles was investigated by measuring their effect on surface tension of the samples in m-xylene solution. Triazoles, which contained polyfluoroalkyl chains C6F13CH2CH2 and C7F15CH2 in position-1 revealed quite different behaviour from other types of triazoles and tetrazoles. The triazoles that contained single polyfluoroalkyl ether substituents and the triethyleneglycol substituents in position-4 had highly consistent surfactant behaviour. 2,5-Disubstituted tetrazoles that contained C6F13CH2CH2 and C7F15CH2 substituents at position-1 showed similar results as those of the triazoles. The number of methylene spacer groups between the perfluoroalkyl chain and the heterocycle had a major influence on the surfactant properties. Decreasing the number of spacer groups from two to one (or increasing the fluorine content) gave higher surface activity. The attachment of a hydrophilic group gave better surface activity than the attachment of a lipophilic group, and use of a tetrazole heterocycle in preference to a 1,2,3-triazole core also gave significant improvements.Finally, a preliminary synthetic study demonstrated the potential towards the design of polynuclear heterocyclic fluorous surfactants.},

abstract={The work presented in this thesis was mainly targeted at exploring the capabilities of evaporation based LC detectors as well as further alternatives for the control of impurities in substances not exhibiting a suitable chromophore for UV-detection. In the course of the work carried out, several new methods for the identification, impurities control and composition testing of APIs were elaborated. An evaporation based detector that entered into the field of pharmaceutical analysis in the recent years was the Evaporative Light Scattering Detector (ELSD). However, non-reproducible spikes were reported when injecting concentrated test solutions as they are usually required for the control of impurities. The reasons, for the appearance of these spikes as well as possibilities for their avoidance were explored in a systematic study. Moreover, the dependence of the detector sensitivity on different eluent composition, eluent flow-rate and ELSD settings was investigated. In the course of the revision of the Ph.Eur. monographs for aspartic acid and alanine, a C18 reversed phase ion-pair LC method using 1 mmol/L of perfluoroheptanoic acid as an ion-pair reagent and a charged aerosol detector (CAD) was developed and fully validated for the purity control of Asp. The method was capable of separating the organic acids and major amino acids known to occur as process related impurities. With a slight modification, the method was also applicable for the purity control of Ala. Based on the developed LC-CAD method for the impurity control of alanine, a comparative study of the performance characteristics of different evaporation based LC detectors, i.e. ELSD, CAD and the recently developed Nano Quantity Analyte Detector (NQAD) was carried out. Additionally, an MS detector and qNMR were included in this study. It was found that the control of impurities in Alanine at an ICH conform level could be ensured using LC coupled to CAD, MSD and NQAD detection as well as by the use of qNMR. In terms of performance, prize and ease of use CAD and NQAD were found to be the most suitable alternatives. In terms of repeatability and sensitivity, the CAD appeared slightly superior to the NQAD. The quality of streptomycin sulfate is not sufficiently controlled by the current Ph.Eur. monograph in that an appropriate test for the control of the related substances is missing. A study was carried out to develop a C18 reversed phase ion-pair LC method using pentafluoropropionic acid as an ion-pair reagent and a CAD for the identification and control of the related substances. The developed method allowed the separation of 21 impurities from streptomycin. Moreover, coupling of the method to MS allowed the identification of the separated impurities. The method was shown to be sufficiently sensitive to control the related substances with a disregard limit of 0.1% as it is normally applied in the Ph.Eur. for products derived from fermentation. Currently, the aescin content of horse-chestnut standardized dry extract is determined using a complex and laborious photometric determination. A more selective LC-UV assay determination for beta-aescin has been proposed for the Ph.Eur. draft monograph of horse-chestnut standardized dry extract. Possibilities were explored to further improve the LC-method using detection by CAD. It was demonstrated that by the use of a modified LC-CAD method several problems related to the differences in the UV-response of the various components contained in the active aescin fraction could be eliminated. Moreover the proposed reference standard strategy was reviewed. Eventually, it was demonstrated on the example of two different clusters of pharmacologically active peptides how low energy collision induced dissociation mass spectrometry (low energy CID-MS) can successfully be used for identification testing in pharmacopoeial monographs. In this respect, the combination of a direct confirmation of the molecular mass via the m/z-ratio of the molecule ions with structural sequence information obtained by low energy CID-MS experiments was found to deliver a higher degree of certainty of the identity of a given substance than the set of tests currently described in the monographs. A significant gain in efficiency and throughput and important reduction of the amount of sample consumed during testing were identified as being additional advantages of this approach. Taken together, it could be demonstrated on various examples how recent technological advancements in the field of analytical chemistry can contribute to improve the quality control of APIs. ; Die durchgeführten Arbeiten hatten zum Ziel, das Potential von evaporationsbasierten HPLC-Detektoren sowie weiterer moderner Techniken hinsichtlich ihrer Eignung zur Reinheitsprüfung von pharmazeutischen Wirkstoffen zu untersuchen. Im Zuge der Arbeiten wurden verschiedene neue Methoden zur Identifizierung, Verunreinigungskontrolle und zur Überprüfung der Zusammensetzung von pharmazeutischen Wirkstoffen entwickelt. Ein evaporationsbasierter Detektor, der in den letzten Jahren Einzug in die pharmazeutische Analytik gehalten hat, ist der Lichtstreudetektor (ELSD). Allerdings wurde berichtet, dass es im Zusammenhang mit der Injektion konzentrierter Testlösungen zum Auftreten nicht reproduzierbarer Spikes kam. In einer systematischen Studie wurden die Gründe hierfür ermittelt und gleichzeitig Möglichkeiten ihrer Vermeidung aufgezeigt. Darüber hinaus wurde die Abhängigkeit der Empfindlichkeit des Detektors von der Zusammensetzung der mobilen Phase, der LC-Flußrate und den Einstellungen des ELSD untersucht. Im Zuge der Revision der Monografien für Asparaginsäure und Alanin wurde eine C18-Ionenpaar-HPLC-Methode unter Verwendung von 1 mmol/L Perfluorheptansäure und Detektion mittels eines geladenen Sprühnebeldetektors (Charged Aerosol Detector – CAD) für die Reinheitskontrolle von Asparaginsäure entwickelt und validiert. Mit Hilfe dieser Methode konnten sowohl organische Säuren als auch die wesentlichen Aminosäuren, die als prozessrelevante Verunreinigungen bekannt sind, abgetrennt werden. Nach geringfügiger Modifikation konnte diese Methode auch zur Reiheitskontrolle von Alanin eingesetzt werden. Basierend auf der HPLC-CAD-Methode für Alanin wurde eine vergleichende Studie der Leistungsfähigkeit verschiedener evaporationsbasierter HPLC-Detektoren durch-geführt. Untersucht wurden der ELSD, der CAD und der kürzlich entwickelte „Nano Quantity Analyte Detektor“ (NQAD). Weiterhin wurden ein massenspektrometrischer Detektor (MSD) sowie die Quantifizierung mittels NMR-Spektroskopie (qNMR) in die Untersuchung einbezogen. Im Ergebnis war die Reinheitskontrolle von Alanin auf einem ICH konformen Niveau unter Verwendung des CAD, NQAD und MSD sowie mittels qNMR möglich. Hinsichtlich der Kriterien Leistungsfähigkeit, Preis und Benutzerfreundlichkeit waren der CAD und der NQAD die geeignetsten Alternativen. Bezüglich Wiederholbarkeit und Empfindlichkeit war der CAD dem NQAD leicht überlegen. Die Qualität von Streptomycinsulfat wird von der aktuellen Arzneibuchmonografie mangels eines geeigneten Reinheitstests nicht ausreichend kontrolliert. Aus diesem Grund wurde eine C18-Ionenpaar-HPLC-Methode unter Verwendung von Perfluorpropionsäure und Detektion mittels CAD zur Identifizierung und Kontrolle der Verunreinigungen entwickelt. Mit dieser Methode konnten 21 Verunreinigungen von Streptomycin abgetrennt und nach massenspektormetrischer Kopplung identifiziert werden. Die Methode erwies sich als ausreichend empfindlich, um Verunreinigungen mit einer Ausschlussgrenze von 0.1%, wie sie im Europäischen Arzneibuch für Fermentationsprodukte üblicherweise angewandt wird, zu kontrollieren. Derzeit wird der Aescingehalt in standardisiertem Rosskastanien-Trockenextrakt mittels einer komplexen photometrischen Methode bestimmt. Für den entsprechen-den Entwurf einer Monografie des Europäischen Arzneibuchs wurde eine selektivere HPLC-UV-Methode vorgeschlagen. Die Möglichkeiten einer weiteren Verbesserung dieser Methode unter Verwendung des CAD wurden untersucht. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass eine modifizierte HPLC-CAD-Methode geeignet ist, Probleme, die sich aus der unterschiedlichen UV-Absorption der im Aescingemisch enthaltenen Substanzen ergeben, zu eliminieren. Weiterhin wurde die vorgeschlagene Referenzstandard Strategie überprüft. Abschließend wurde am Beispiel von zwei Gruppen pharmakologisch wirksamer Peptide nachgewiesen, wie kollisionsinduzierte Massenspektrometrie (CID-MS) erfolgreich für die Identitätskontrolle in Arzneibuchmongrafien eingesetzt werden kann. Diesbezüglich erbrachte die Kombination der direkten Massenbestätigung mittels des m/z-Verhältnisses des Molekül-Ions mit den aus dem CID-MS-Experiment erhaltenen Informationen ein höheres Maß an Gewissheit hinsichtlich der Identitätsbestätigung als die derzeit beschriebenen Tests. Als weitere Vorteile dieses Ansatzes wurden ein wesentlicher Effizienzgewinn sowie eine erhebliche Reduktion des durch die Testung verbrauchten Probenmaterials identifiziert. Zusammenfassend zeigen die Arbeiten an verschiedenen Beispielen, wie aktuelle Entwicklungen im Bereich der analytischen Chemie dazu beitragen können, die Qualitätskontrolle von Arzneimittelwirkstoffen zu verbessern.},

abstract={Humans are exposed to chemical carcinogens and endocrine disruptors for instances through environment and diet they consume. Special attention should be paid to pregnant mothers in whom consumption of any harmful compounds can lead to adverse effects in a new born baby as it is believed that these compounds pass through the placenta. The developing foetus is vulnerable to toxic and teratogenic effects and the prenatal exposure of chemicals might lead to developmental changes or even increase in the risk of developing cancer later in life. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the transplacental transfer of perfluorinated compounds using ex-vivo placental perfusion methodology. Placental perfusion techniques are currently used to study not only the organ functions but also the transplacental transfer and placental metabolism of different compounds. In addition BeWo choriocarcinoma cell line to study the effect of PFOS and PFOA on ABCG2 transporter expression. Several placentas were perfused with PFOA and PFOS, but only 2 perfusions fulfilled the criteria for successful perfusion. It was shown that both PFOS and PFOA cross placenta although the transfer rate is relatively slow and clearly slower than with reference compound antipyrine which crosses placenta by passive diffusion. In conclusion our results suggest that foetuses are exposed to PFOS and PFOA which is in line with biomonotoring studies. Furthermore, neither PFOS nor PFOA significantly affected ABCG2 transporter expression in BeWo cells.},

abstract={Niedermolekulare polyphile Blockmoleküle, bei denen chemisch zueinander inkompatible Segmente kovalent miteinander verknüpft sind, haben sich durch ihre Fähigkeit, neuartige komplexe Mesophasenstrukturen auszubilden, in den letzten Jahren zu einem interessanten Gebiet innerhalb der Flüssigkristallforschung entwickelt. Eine wichtige Klasse bilden dabei kalamitische Bolaamphiphile, die einen flexiblen lateralen Substituenten tragen. Die in derartigen Verbindungen realisierte Kombination von Amphiphilie und Formanisotropie führt zu neuartigen Mesophasen mit außergewöhnlich komplexen Strukturen. Die vorliegende Arbeit umfasst die Synthese neuer polyphiler, niedermolekularer Blockmoleküle, bei denen an gegenüberliegenden Seiten eines bolaamphiphilen Grundgerüstes zwei Substituenten unterschiedlicher chemischer Natur fixiert wurden. Die flüssigkristallinen Eigenschaften wurden eingehend mittels Polarisationsmikroskopie, Differentialkalorimetrie und röntgenographischer Methoden charakterisiert. Um zu einem grundlegenden Verständnis des Aggregationsverhaltens dieser polyphilen Blockmoleküle zu gelangen, wurde in einem systematischen Ansatz die Größe der lateralen Substituenten als auch deren chemische Natur (Alkyl-, Perfluoralkyl- und Carbosilansegmente) variiert. Die synthetisierten Verbindungen zeigen eine große Vielfalt neuer komplexer Mesophasen. Von besonderem Interesse sind dabei die in den kolumnaren Phasen mit Zylinderstrukturen auftretende Konkurrenz von intra- und interkolumnarer Segregation, Zylinderstrukturen, die sich als mehrfarbige Parkettierung der Ebene beschreiben lassen sowie Anordnungen von Riesenzylindern mit außergewöhnlichen Formen und komplexen Überstrukturen. ; Polyphilic low molecular weight block molecules, in which chemically incompatible units are fixed covalently, have become a field of increased interest within liquid crystal research in the last few years due to their ability to form novel complex superstructures. An important class of such compounds represent calamitic bolaamphiphiles with flexible lateral chains. The combination of amphiphilic self-organization and shape anisotropy leads to the formation of novel mesophases with extraordinary complex structures. The subject of this work is the synthesis of novel polyphilic low molecular weight block molecules, in which two substituents of different chemical nature were fixed at opposite sides of a bolaamphiphilic structure. The liquid crystalline properties were characterized by means of polarizing microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray scattering. To gain fundamental knowledge about the aggregation behaviour of these polyphilic block molecules the size of the lateral substituents as well as their chemical nature (alkyl, perfluoroalkyl and carbosilane segments) was changed in a systematic approach. The synthesized compounds show a wide variety of new complex mesophases. Of particular interest are: columnar phases with cylinder structures (intra- vs. intercolumnar segregation), cylinder structures which can be described as multicolour tilings and giant cylinder structures with extraordinary shapes and complex superstructures. ; von Robert Kieffer},

abstract={Master ; 최근 신재생 에너지 분야에 대한 연구 필요성이 커짐에 따라 제작비용이 적고 진공공정이 필요 없으며 대면적 및 플렉서블 소자로 제작 가능한 유기태양전지 분야의 연구가 활발히 진행되고 있다. 유기태양전지에서 poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)와 [6-6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) 블렌드로 이루어진 광활성층에서 전극으로의 전하 추출은, 결정적으로 각 전극층 사이에 존재하는 계면층에 많은 영향을 받는다. 그러나 유기태양전지 분야의 괄목 할 진보에도 불구하고, 계면층의 전하 추출에 대한 체계적인 연구가 보고 되지 않았으므로 본 연구에서는 고효율의 유기태양전지 구현을 위한 계면층에 대한 연구를 체계적으로 수행하였다 . Chapter 1 에서는 광활성층과 알루미늄 음전극 사이에 위치하는 계면층의 일함수와 형태적 차이가 소자의 open circuit voltage (Voc) 및 연속노광 상태에서의 소자수명에 미치는 영향에 대하여 분석함으로써, 고효율 및 장수명의 유기태양전자를 위한 계면층의 역할에 대해 연구 하였다. 최종적으로 광활성층과 Ohmic접촉을 이루는 계면층에 의하여 소자의 Voc를 극대화 할 수 있으며, 메탈전극의 산화 및 이동을 막는 계면층의 차단효과에 의하여 시간에 따른 효율의 하락을 큰 폭으로 늦출 수 있다. Chapter 2 에서는 광활성층에서 생성된 전하를 ITO와 같은 양전극으로 운송 하는 역할을 하는 정공추출층(Hole extraction layer, HEL)의 일함수 및 수직방향 상분리 변화에 의해 소자의 Voc 및 연속노광 상태에서의 소자수명에 미치는 영향을 분석하였다. 정공추출층으로 널리쓰이는 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) : poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)에 perfluorinated ionomer (PFI)를 혼합하고, PFI 양에 비례하여 표면일함수를 증가시킴으로써, Low band gap donor polymer인 poly[N-9’-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4’,7’-di-2-thienyl-2’,1’,3’-benzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT)의 HOMO level에 상응하는 일함수의 PEDOT:PSS:PFI층을 구현하였다. 즉, 광활성층과 정공추출층이 Omhic한 접합을 형성함으로써, 포텐셜의 손실없이 광전하가 추출되므로 소자의 Voc가 증가되었다. 또한 표면으로 갈수록 PFI의 조성이 많아지는 수직방향으로 상분리된 PEDOT:PSS:PFI 층이 형성되어, 소자수명을 저해하는 입자의 이동을 막으므로 연속노광 상태에서의 소자수명이 증가되었다. ; In organic bulk heterojunction solar cells, the charge extraction from the photoactive layer to each electrode is critically affected by the interface of the photoactive layer which consist of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6-6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester blend. Although significant progress has been made in organic bulk heterojunction solar cells, the systematic study of electron extraction in interfacial layer have not been reported so far to the best of our knowledge. In Chapter 1, We find that the ultrathin barium fluoride (BaF2) layer at electron extraction contact strongly influences the open-circuit voltage (Voc) rather than the short-circuit current, strongly depending on the nano-morphology evolution with the increase of the BaF2 thickness. Since the vacuum deposited ultrathin BaF2 layer below 3 nm is partially covered on top of polymeric photoactive layer according to the island growth mode, the Voc and power conversion efficiency (PCE) tend to increases up to one monolayer thickness (~3 nm), while the Jsc tends to be maintained. The fill factor and the PCE tend to decrease abruptly beyond the monolayer thickness, which can be ascribed to the insulating nature of BaF2. We find that the BaF2 device showed a little improved maximum PCE (4.0 %) and also greatly (> 5 times) improved device half-lifetime under continuous 100mW/cm2 irradiation, compared with the device using the conventional LiF interlayer (PCE: 3.8 %). In Chapter 2, self-organized gradient hole extraction layer (HEL) with tunable work function was effectively employed for high efficiency organic solar cells based on poly[N-9’-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4’,7’-di-2-thienyl-2’,1’,3’-benzothiadiazole): [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCDTBT:PCBM). Our HEL was prepared by adding a perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) into the standard poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) : poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), which resulted in vertical phase segregation of PFI toward the film surface. We tuned the surface work function by controlling the concentration of PFI in the conducting polymer composition. Since the ionization potential of PCDTBT (5.47eV) is higher than the work function of the standard poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) : poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (5.0 eV), our HEL with higher work function becomes more effective to improve the open circuit voltage (Voc). With our HEL, the Voc was significantly increased from 0.74V to 0.89V and quite similar short circuit current (Jsc) was observed. This indicates that the work function tuning of HEL influences more dominantly on the Voc rather than Jsc. We also demonstrate that our HEL greatly improve the device lifetime under continuous irradiation of AM 1.5-100 mW/cm2 simulated sunlight, which can be attributed to a critical role of the self-organized PFI as a buffer layer at the surface of our HEL.},

abstract={A low-cost and easily constructed porous aromatic framework (PAF-45) was successfully prepared using the Scholl reaction. PAF-45 was, for the first time, used to remove perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) from aqueous solution. Systematic experiments were performed to determine the adsorption capacity of PAF-45 for PFOS and to characterize the kinetics of the adsorption process. The adsorption of PFOS onto PAF-45 reached equilibrium in 30 min, and the adsorption capacity of PAF-45 for PFOS was excellent (5847 mg g(-1) at pH 3). The amount of PFOS adsorbed by PAF-45 increased significantly as the cation (Na+, Mg2+, or Fe3+) concentration increased, which probably occurred because the cations enhanced the interactions between the negatively charged PFOS molecules and the positively charged PAF-45 surface. The cations Na+, Mg2+, and Fe3+ were found to form complexes with PFOS anions in solution. Density functional theory was used to identify the interactions between PFOS and Na+, Mg2+, and Fe3+. We expect that materials of the same type as PAF-45 could be useful adsorbents for removing organic pollutants from industrial wastewater and contaminated surface water.},

abstract={China has gradually become the most important manufacturing and consumption centre for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the world, and inadvertently become the world's major contamination hotspots. However, a systematic analysis of pollution pathways for PFOS/PFOA into the different environmental compartments and their quantification in China has yet to be carried out. This study focused on PFOS and PFOA release into the environment in the central and eastern region of China, which accounts for the vast majority of national emission. About 80-90% of PFOS/PFOA contamination in the Chinese environment was estimated to come directly from manufacturing and industrial sites mostly via wastewater discharge from these facilities. The other major contamination sources for PFOS were identified as being linked to aqueous fire-fighting foams (AFFFs), and pesticides including suifluramid. For PFOA, following some way behind industrial wastewater, were industrial exhaust gas, domestic wastewater and landfill leachate as contamination sources. For surface water contamination, the major pollution contributors after industrial wastewater were AFFF spill runoff for PFOS, and domestic wastewater and precipitation-runoff for PFOA. The majority of PFOS that contaminated soil was considered to be linked with infiltration of AFFF and pesticides, while most PFOA in soil was attributed to atmospheric deposition and landfill leachate. Where groundwater had become contaminated, surface water seepage Was estimated to contribute about 50% of PFOS and 40% of PFOA while the remainder Was mostly derived from soil leaching. A review of the available monitoring data for PFOS/PFOA in the literature supported the view that industrial wastewater, landfill leachate and AFFF application were the dominant sources. Higher concentrations of PFOA than PFOS found in precipitation also corroborated the prediction of more PFOA release into air. To reduce PFOS/PFOA contamination of the Chinese environment the focus for control should be on industrial wastewater emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Significant quantities of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are released to the environment from fluorochemical manufacturing processes through wastewater discharge and air emission in China, which may lead to human exposure and health risks through crop bioaccumulation from PFAAs-contaminated soil and irrigation water. This paper systematically studied the distribution and transport of PFAAs in agricultural soil, irrigation water and precipitation, followed by crop bioaccumulation and finally human exposure of PFAAs within a 10 km radius around a mega-fluorochemical industrial park (FIP). Hotspots of contamination by PFAAs were found near the FIP and downstream of the effluent discharge point with the maximum concentrations of 641 ng/g in agricultural soil, 480 ng/g in wheat grain, 58.8 ng/g in maize grain and 4,862 ng/L in precipitation. As the distance increased from the FIP, PFAAs concentrations in all media showed a sharp initial decrease followed by a moderate decline. Elevated PFAA concentrations in soil and grains were still present within a radius of 10 km of the FIP. The soil contamination was associated with the presence of PFAAs in irrigation water and precipitation, and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the dominant PFAA component in soil. However, due to bioaccumulation preference, short-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), especially perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), became the major PFAA contaminants in grains of wheat and maize. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for both grains showed a decrease with increasing chain length of PFAAs (approximately 0.5 log decrease per CF2 group). Compared to maize grain, wheat grain showed higher BAFs, possibly related to its higher protein content. The PFCA (C4-C8) concentrations (on a log(10) basis) in agricultural soil and grain were found to show a linear positive correlation. Local human exposure of PFOA via the consumption of contaminated grains represents a health risk for local residents, especially for toddlers and children.},

The breakdown strengths of C/sub 6/F/sub 10/ (perfluorocyclohexene) and C/sub 6/F/sub 12/ (mixture of 1,2- and 1,3-perfluorodimethylcyclobutane) have been found to be, respectively, 2.3 to 2.4 and 1.9 to 2.2 times higher than SF/sub 6/ under identical experimental conditions. The breakdown strengths of mixtures of C/sub 4/F/sub 6/, SF/sub 6/, c-C/sub 4/F/sub 8/, iso-C/sub 4/F/sub 8/, and C/sub 3/F/sub 8/ with N/sub 2/ have been studied systematically in various combinations in an effort to understand the role of the basic properties and effectiveness of each component of a multicomponent gas on the breakdown strength. A number of such mixtures (e.g., 20 percent C/sub 4/F/sub 6/, 20 percent SF/sub 6/, and 60 percent N/sub 2/) are better and cheaper than SF/sub 6/. Basic electron attachment data have been obtained for C/sub 3/F/sub 8/, and the overall effectiveness of inelastic processes has been assessed for a number of gases based on their electron transport coefficients. Work on our new high-pressure, high-voltage and variable temperature (-40 to +120/sup 0/C) chamber for uniform-field breakdown tests proceeded well. Design of apparatus for breakdown testing with nonuniform fields and/or rough surfaces has begun; concentric-cylinder field electrodes of varied surface roughness are under fabrication.

abstract={Corrosion and biofoulings are ubiquitous problems with detrimental impact for a variety of industries. Transforming intrinsically hydrophilicity of metallic surface to be non-wetting superhydrophobicity is highly desired for acquiring protective surfaces. In this paper, hydrothermal structured superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated on aluminum alloy substrates through ammonia etching followed with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PFDTES) modification. The surface morphologies, roughness, chemical compositions and the relationship between hydrothermal parameters and wettability transition were systematically investigated. Besides, the selfcleaning ability, corrosion resistance, NaCl deliquescence behavior, anti-bacterial and anti-icing properties were evaluated. The results demonstrated a remarkably improved charge transfer resistance (Rct), high anti-bacterial efficiency towards E. coli and S. aureus bacteria and significantly enhanced anti-icing performance. We believe the superior corrosion resisting, bacterial suppression and ice over delay performance of superhydrophobic metallic materials will exhibit promising applications in various industrial fields.},

abstract={Previously, the nanofiltration (NF) membrane has been applied to remove perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS), a persistent pollutant from drinking water by our group. However, the effects of co-existence ions on the PFOS removal have not been systematically studied. For instance, cations such as Ca2+ and Fe3+ are found to coordinate with -SO3 groups of PFOS molecule and subsequently influence the rejection properties of NF membrane. In this study, a commercial NF membrane (ESNAl-K1) was utilized to separate PFOS compounds in the existence of three cations including Na+, Ca2+ and Fe3+, as well as three anions including Cl-, SO42- and PO43-. The PFOS rejection increased from 92.65% to 94.74%, 97.14%, and 97.94%, respectively, with 2 mM Na+, Ca2+ and Fe3+, respectively. As the concentrations of anions including SO42- and PO43- increased to 2 mM, the PFOS rejection increased to 94.74% and 97.60%, respectively. The density functional theory (DFT) was applied to analyze the interaction between three different cations with PFOS molecule. It indicated that one Na+ ion could only bind with one PFOS molecule, but every Ca2+ or Fe3+ ion preferred to coordinate with two PFOS molecules. Based on the analysis results of the NF membranes while using the atomic force microscopy (AFM), surface zeta potential (electro-osmosis) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the major separation mechanisms of PFOS in the existence of other cations and anions were the sieving effect, and the electrostatic repulsion, respectively.},

ABTRACTurpose: The objective of this study is to investigate the association between husbands’ alcohol drinking and wives’ HRQOL in the postpartum period.ethods: We used multistage stratified systematic sampling to recruit 24,200 pairs, postpartum women and newborns, from the Taiwan national birth register in 2005. A structured questionnaire was successfully administered to 87.8% of the sampled population. Subjects undertook a home interview 6 months after their deliveries between June 2005 and July 2006. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form (SF-36) was used to measure the quality of life of the women with their husbands’ alcohol drinking behavior.esults: After controlling for the potential confounders, there were significantly gradual decreases in wives’ scores of SF-36 scales other than physical functioning along with the increase in frequency of husbands’ alcohol drinking. There were significantly gradual decreases in wives’ scores of SF-36 scales other than physical functioning and role-physical along with the increase in frequency of husbands’ alcohol drinking either in primiparous or multiparous womenonclusions: Our study adds evidence supporting the adverse effect of husbands’ alcohol drinking on women’s health as measured by the SF-36 HRQOL. . ABTRACTurpose: The aim of this study was to develop a sensitive, convenient and accurate method by using UPLC-MS/MS for a broad range of PFCs for studies involving large sample series. ethods: We analyze the perfluorinated compounds by using ultra performance liquid chromatography－tandem mass spectrometry with protein precipitation and matrix-matched calibration method. And seven samples of plasma from TBPS were analyzed to investigate the applicability of this validated method.esults: Perfluorinated compounds were detected in all seven plasma samples. The average concentration of PFOS and PFOA were 31.25 ng/mL and 3.52 ng/mL. Moreover, UPLC provides significantly reduced analysis time and improved chromatographic behavior for PFCs compared with traditional LC.onclusions: The low sample volume needed, the limited time consuming and the broad range of analytes which are included, make this method advantageous for large-scale epidemiological studies. Besides, this sample preparation technique and matrix-matched calibration method can easily be set up on standard LC-MS/MSnstruments and is thus available to a wide range of laboratories. ; Contentsusbands’ drinking behavior as a risk factor of wives’ health-related quality of life in the postpartum period 1文摘要 2BTRACT 3bbreviations 4ntroduction 5aterials and Methods 7tudy population and sampling strategy 7ata collection 7usbands’ drinking behavior 8ealth-related Quality of Life measures 9otential confounding variables 9tatistical analysis 10esults 11iscussion 19cknowledgements 23eferences 24ppendix 28igure 1.

abstract={Inspired by the excellent superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning properties of the lotus leaf, numerous superhydro-oleophobic micro/nanostructures have been developed which mimicked biological systems. These structures have broad applications in industrial processes, especially oil transportation, oil/water separation and anti-fouling applications where oil adhesion is a critical factor. Although the adhesion properties of oils have been well explored on a variety of surfaces at ambient environment, low temperature behaviors were rarely reported especially when the oil is frozen under a frigid environment. For instance, there are cases in which oils are stuck or frozen onto the walls of engines or pipelines resulting in a large drag force thus leading to excess energy consumption and potential instrument malfunction. In this research project, the initial stage was mainly focused on developing an effective approach to construct well-defined superhydro-oleophobic microstructures and investigating the effects of structures and surface chemistry on superoleophobicity. In this stage, two different chemical modification approaches were applied to both flat and micropillared PDMS: 1) vapour deposition of trichloro (1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorooctyl) silane (FDTS) on cured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer surface (FDTS coated PDMS); 2) blending FDTS with the liquid PDMS precursor before curing (FDTS blended PDMS). Surfaces with varied oleophobicity were fabricated to investigate the effects of superhydro-oleophobicity on the reduction of frozen oil adhesion as characterized by knock-off tests. The relationship between the oleophobicity, which ranged from oleophilic flat surfaces to superoleophobic micropillars, and the reduction of oil adhesion at low temperatures was examined. It was observed that reduced contact angle hysteresis (CAH) led to reduced adhesion strength. By blending FDTS into PDMS micropillars, 60% adhesion strength reduction compared with flat surfaces was achieved. In order to eliminate the frozen oil effectively, electrical de-freezing was proposed by passing electrical current through the top surface layer to induce joule heating effect. To achieve this, epoxy-silver flakes composite micropillars were developed, demonstrating electrical conductivity and superoleophobicity. The effects of resistivity and superoleophobicity on the reduction and elimination of frozen-oil adhesion have been systematically studied, showing that the larger the resistivity and the oleophobicity, the less force was needed to remove frozen-oil droplet. After developing the electrically conductive polymer composite micropillars for eliminating frozen oil adhesion, we have extended this work, aiming to reduce the amount of conductive Ag flakes in the composite and make stretchable multifunctional composite elastomers. Electrically conductive and superoleophobic PDMS has been fabricated by embedding Ag flakes (SFs) & Ag nanowires (SNWs) into microstructures of the FDTS-blended PDMS elastomer achieved in the first stage of this project. A series of surface analyses and characterizations showed that highly conductive and superoleophobic surfaces were indeed obtained with a relatively low surface coverage of conductive fillers. A significant improvement to the conductivity was further achieved by using SNWs to partially replace the SFs. The stretchability and conductivity were examined under external strain, which showed that the as-prepared samples are highly stretchable and reversible. The electrical resistance of the SFs/SNWs embedded surface was less dependent on the strain due to the presence of the SNWs, creating a bridging effect and allowing current to flow consistently even as the silver particles were stretched apart from each other. This research demonstrates a simple approach to transform insulating elastomers into functional composites with a desired surface oleophobicity and electrical conductivity, which is of great help for the development multifunctional superoleophobic structures and their applications in oil adhesion reduction at low temperatures.},

abstract={In spite of the vast array of modelling techniques and force fields available, the study of the phase behaviour, structure, microstructure, and dynamics of mixtures remains a challenging task. A systematic coarse-graining (CG) methodology is employed in this thesis involving the parameterisation of force fields using a top-down approach, by effectively describing a large number of target macroscopic thermodynamic states with a rigorous molecular-based equation of state. A recent incarnation of the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT-gamma) is used. The underlying force field is based on the Mie intermolecular potential, which is a generalised form of the Lennard-Jones potential with a variable and versatile form of the repulsive and attractive interactions. The coarse-grained force fields developed in this manner are used directly in Molecular Dynamics simulations in order to explore the dynamical, structural, and interfacial properties, which can not be directly accessed by the equation of state (unless a suitable treatment of the inhomogenous properties of the system is made). The goal of any coarse-graining procedure is to derive simple, but accurate, robust, and transferable force fields. By aiming for the simplicity, the coarse-grained models developed in our work are typically based on the three-to-one mapping, i.e., one bead containing approximately three heavy atoms, or one-to-one mapping for the small spherical molecules, with the polar, directional, and long-ranged interactions between the beads treated implicitly using the effective spherically-symmetric Mie potentials. The SAFT-gamma Mie coarse-graining methodology is exemplified for a number of fluid systems of different complexities, including pure component systems, such as: the homologous series of n-alkanes, n-perfluoroalkanes, semifluorinated alkanes, ethers and water; binary and ternary mixtures, comprising the carbon dioxide, n-alkanes, and water; and finally the aqueous mixtures of alkyl polyoxyethylene glycol non-ionic surfactants. An accurate representation of the vapour-liquid properties with both, the equation of state and molecular simulation, is obtained for the molecules of different size and chemical nature. Describing the properties of water is, however, a much more difficult task. The CG model suffers from issues associated with the transferability and representability of the various properties for different thermodynamic conditions, as a consequence of the aggressive averaging of the strongly directional and polar forces into an effective spherically symmetrical potential. It has been shown that an isotropic single-site CG model based on a spherically symmetrical potential cannot capture all of the thermodynamic properties of water simultaneously (the issue of representability). Two different CG models of water are proposed: the first is designed to accurately reproduce the saturation liquid density and vapour pressure, and the second to capture the saturation liquid density and surface tension with high precision. Both models benefit from an accurate parameterisation of temperature dependence following the target properties over the entire temperature range of the fluid. An additional model is developed based on the two-to-one mapping, enabling more efficient large scale simulations in, for example, biomolecular systems. The models of the binary mixtures are developed by using the corresponding pure component models with an additional adjustable parameter to account for the unlike interactions; the latter are obtained by considering appropriate properties of the mixtures such as the fluid-phase equilibria or the thermodynamic properties of mixing. The unlike interactions are shown to be transferable for a quantitative description of the phase behaviour over a wide range of conditions and for the systems of related components. We are able to obtain an accurate prediction of the azeotropic point, critical loci, tree phase line, global density, and the shape of phase envelopes for studied mixtures. The quality of predictions is found comparable to the results from the atomistic models and other equations of state. The aqueous mixtures of alkyl polyoxyethylene glycol non-ionic surfactants are a key final goal of the research presented in this thesis. The CG models of the surfactants are developed within the SAFT-gamma group-contribution framework, where each functional group is derived from an accurate representation of the corresponding chemical moiety. By capturing a delicate interplay of the repulsive and attractive intermolecular interactions and obtaining the right balance between energetic and entropic effects, the various phase morphologies at ambient conditions can be reproduced in agreement with the experimental findings over the entire concentration range. The force fields developed in the current work allow for a prediction of key structural and interfacial properties. The Molecular Dynamics simulations reveal the spontaneous formation of micelles at low surfactant concentrations and a self-assembly into a bilayer at high surfactant concentrations. The aggregation numbers, the critical micelle concentration, area per molecule, the surface excess properties, and bilayer thickness are found in very good agreement with experimental data. This is very encouraging considering that only macroscopic thermophysical properties are used to develop the underlying force fields that describe the fine interactions between the molecules in the system. Despite the simplicity, coarse-grained force fields are shown to be robust and transferable; they can be applied to predict the properties which were not used in the original parameterisation procedure, with an accuracy comparable to the more sophisticated and computationally demanding models. ; Open Access},

abstract={This research aims at improving the efficiency of solution processed organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). The first part of this research work involved investigating the effects of Triton X-100 in a single layer solution processed blue phosphorescent OLED (PHOLED) with poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) and 1,3-bis[(4- tertbutylphenyl) -1,3,4 oxidiazolyl] phenylene (OXD-7) as host and bis(4,6- difluorophenylpyridinato-N,C2)picolinatoiridium (FIrpic) act as guest. Results indicate that the addition of Triton X-100 into the emissive layer (EML) can provide spatial separation between the guest-host which reduces the back energy transfer from the high triplet FIrpic to the low triplet PVK. The addition of Triton X-100 also increased the EML film roughness which is beneficial for electron injection at the cathode as evidenced from the Atomic Force Microcsopy (AFM) images, single carrier devices characteristics and photovoltaic measurements. Blue PHOLED with efficiency 8.5 lm/W at 1000 cd/m2 was achieved by adding Triton X-100 into the EML. This efficiency is comparable to the best efficiency of a single layer solution processed blue PHOLED reported to date. The effects of perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) doped poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as hole injection layer (HIL) in a single layer solution processed blue PHOLED was investigated. A systematic study on the interplay of PFI concentrations, device efficiency, PEDOT:PSS thin film conductivity and transparency were carried out to determine the optimum amount of PFI to yield the best blue PHOLED efficiency. Compared to the control device, the optimized device efficiencies improved from 7.3 lm/W and 5.9 lm/W to 9.4 lm/W and 7.9 lm/W at 100 cd/m2 and 1000 cd/m2 respectively. We successfully demonstrated that the efficiency of a single layer solution processed yellow fluorescent OLED can be increased markedly by treating the EML surface with fluorinated alcohol. The fluorinated alcohol treatment improves the device efficiency to 19.3 lm/W at 1000 cd/m2 which corresponds to ~74% increment compared to the control device. To the best of our knowledge, this power efficiency is one of the best reported to date for a solution processed yellow fluorescent OLED. The improvement is attributed to the formation of a surface dipole layer induced by the fluorinated alcohol which effectively lowered the cathodic injection barrier. It was further shown that solvent with higher dipole moment is better in passivating traps on the EML surface. This could be another reason for the high efficiency yellow OLED achieved using fluorinated alcohol treatment. The final part of this research work involved the developments of high efficiency double layer solution processed blue PHOLED. The first emissive layer consists of PVK and FIrpic mixed with 4,4′,4″-tris(N-carbazolyl)-triphenylamine (TCTA) or OXD-7. The second layer consists of an alcohol-soluble 2,7- bis(diphenylphosphoryl)-9,9′-spirobi(fluorine) (SPPO13) and FIrpic. The incorporation of OXD-7 into PVK blurs the interface between the emissive layers heterojunction and widens the recombination zone while blending TCTA into PVK reduces the hole injection barrier from PEDOT:PSS to to the first emissive layer. The best blue device gave an acceptable power efficiency of 11 lm/W at 1000 cd/m2, which is comparable to the best reported fully solution processed multi layer blue PHOLED reported to date.},

abstract={Para extinguir o fogo em líquidos inflamáveis são utilizadas espumas que possuem alta estabilidade. Essas espumas são constituídas de tensoativos perfluorados, que são os responsáveis pela sua alta eficiência na extinção de incêndios. Neste projeto foi realizado um estudo sobre a velocidade de recobrimento destas espumas em função de alguns parâmetros como: natureza química e temperatura do líquido inflamável, concentração do agente espumante e presença de fogo. Foram escolhidos n-hexano, gasolina, óleo diesel e etanol como líquidos inflamáveis; utilizou-se líquidos geradores de espuma, LGE (formulação em solução aquosa contendo surfatantes perfluorados e hidrocarbonados) e FC-600F (constituído por LGE e solução polimérica). O sistema utilizado para efetuar esse estudo foi desenvolvido neste projeto, e é constituído de um dispositivo gerador de espuma e um reservatório aberto que contém o líquido inflamável. Os estudos sobre recobrimento da espuma sobre a superfície dos líquidos inflamáveis foram realizados a partir de imagens obtidas por uma câmera CCD. As imagens foram posteriormente digitalizadas e tratadas através de um programa gráfico. A velocidade de recobrimento foi determinada a partir da área recoberta pela espuma em cada instante. Os resultados obtidos mostraram-se reprodutíveis e permitiram avaliar a influência dos vários parâmetros sobre a velocidade de recobrimento da espuma. Observou-se que a velocidade de recobrimento da espuma nas condições estudadas é praticamente independente da temperatura e da natureza química do hidrocarboneto. No caso do recobrimento sobre etanol, a presença do polímero é fundamental na cobertura da superfície. Observou-se que a velocidade de recobrimento sobre a superfície de hidrocarbonetos é aproximadamente três vezes maior do que sobre superfície de etanol.Os ensaios realizados em campo de prova mostraram que a velocidade de recobrimento sobre a superfície de etanol em chamas é praticamente a mesma em relação à superfície sem combustão. ; An aqueous mixture of perfluorinated and hydrocarbon surfactants is used in fire fighting of B class material (flammable liquids). The foams generated from that solutions (called AFFF aqueous film-forming foam) produces a thin aqueous film with low surface tension, allowing an efficient extinguishment of the fire. Although there are several standard tests to verify the efficiency of the foam, such tests are usually based just on the time required to extinguish. In this work, a systematic study was carried out to verify the influence of some parameter like the chemical nature of the flammable liquid, (hexane, gasoline, diesel and ethanol), temperature and others, on the velocity of foam covering. The project involved the construction of an apparatus to produce a controlled foam that was released on the surface of flammable liquids. Images of the foam covering the surface were obtained using a CCD camera. The images were digitalized using a frame-grabber board, and the area covered by the foam in each time, was determined using graphic software. Hydrocarbon liquids showed a very small dependence of the velocity on the parameters. The covering velocity for the hydrocarbons surfaces is almost three times smaller than for ethanol. The influence of fire on the covering velocity was also studied through tests which were performed in the safety area of 3M-Sumaré-SP. These tests have been shown that there is a small influence of fire on the covering velocity.},

abstract={Master of Science in Engineering (Chemical). University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban 2016. ; Isothermal binary vapour-liquid equilibrium data are presented for gas –liquid systems for R116 and ethane with perfluorohexane and perfluorooctane. There are no data in the open literature for these systems except for ethane with perfluorooctane. These high pressure VLE (HPVLE) measurements form part of the ongoing work by the Thermodynamics Research Unit at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. The work involves, partly, generating a database of thermophysical properties of fluorochemicals. These can be used to develop thermodynamic models. The performance of these models in correlating data can be compared to predictive models. They are also useful to study the interactions between hydrocarbons and perfluorocarbons. This is important for solvent screening in flue gas treatments and absorption processes. HPVLE Measurements were performed over a temperature range of 273 – 313 K and pressures up to 5 MPa. The R116 or ethane binary systems were measured with perfluorohexane and perfluorooctane at four or five isotherms, at temperatures both above and below the critical temperature of the lighter component. The measurements were undertaken using the “static-analytic” type apparatus with the sampling of the phases done using a rapid-online sample-injector (ROLSI™). The expanded uncertainties (95% confidence level) in the temperature, pressure and liquid and vapour composition were estimated as 0.09 K, 0.02 MPa and 0.015 and 0.007 mole fraction, respectively. The VLE data were correlated with the Peng-Robinson equation of state with the classical one-fluid mixing rule and/or Peng-Robinson equation of state (EoS) containing the Mathias Copeman alpha function, Wong Sandler mixing rules with the Non-Random Two-Liquid local composition model. The HPVLE data comprising R116 were described well with the Peng-Robinson EoS and the classical one-fluid mixing rule. The relative deviations in pressure and composition were within 1%. The HPVLE data involving ethane were better represented with the more complex Peng-Robinson EoS with the Wong-Sandler mixing rule. Relative deviations in pressure and composition were within 2%. Although acceptable average absolute relative deviations and bias values in pressure and vapour compositions were obtained, systematic overestimations or underestimations of the experimental vapour compositions were observed. Both thermodynamic models provide good representation of the critical regions.},

abstract={Large-scale rechargeable batteries are expected to play a key role in today's emerging sustainable energy landscape. State-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries are not only widely used in electric vehicles, but they are currently gaining traction as backup power in aircraft and smart grid applications. In all of these cases, safety surrounding the electrolyte, an essential component of a lithium-ion battery, is a challenging limitation: the low flash points of currently used small molecule organic alkyl carbonates impose a high risk of ignition under most operating conditions. For this reason, extensive efforts are being made to develop viable nonflammable electrolytes to replace these organic solvents. Herein, we describe new classes of nonflammable liquid and solid electrolytes composed of oligomeric perfluoropolyethers. These materials are promising electrolyte alternatives due to their low glass transition temperatures, high chemical stability, capacity to dissolve lithium salts such as lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt, and compatibility with various common polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol). Synthetic modifications used to introduce a wide range of functional groups has created a platform of intrinsically fireproof materials that can be chemically tailored to achieve the desired physical, thermal, mechanical, and electrochemical properties for specific battery applications. Using this approach carbonate-, thiol-, allyl-, and propargyl- functionalized perfluoropolyethers were prepared from the commercially available hydroxyl-terminated PFPEs. The terminal group and molecular weight effects on the bulk properties of these materials were systematically characterized and their viability as electrolytes was evaluated. The described work ultimately paves the way towards further optimization of perfluoropolyether materials towards the development of high performance lithium- ion batteries. The interesting properties of these materials invite an extensive study into the fundamental mesoscale ion transport and the relationship between perfluoropolyether chemical structure and electrolyte electrochemical property, as well as a closer analysis into the perfluoropolyether and electrode interface. Investigation in these areas using techniques such as advanced nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy is proposed. ; Doctor of Philosophy},

abstract={Abstract This research work details a systematic study of the structure and function of supramolecular host-guest systems. Host-guest inclusion complexes were formed between β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD) and its copolymers (as hosts), with several types of guest molecules both in aqueous solution and the solid state. The research is divided into two themes; (1) structural characterization and dynamic properties of the inclusion compounds of β-CD with various guest systems in aqueous solution and the solid phase, and (2) heterogeneous adsorption and structural studies of β-CD based copolymers with various guest systems in aqueous solutions. The guest systems include alkyl and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates, perfluoroalkyl sulfonate, and p-nitrophenol (PNP) at variable experimental conditions. In the first theme (chapter 2-5), host-guest complexes in the solid state were prepared using dissolution and slow cool methods at variable host/guest mole ratios (i.e., 1:1 and 2:1). The complexes were further characterized using 19F/13C DP/MAS and CP/MAS solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The solution state complexes were prepared in D2O for structural characterization using 1H/19F NMR spectroscopy. The NMR studies were complemented using FT-IR, thermal analyses (DSC, and TGA), and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Evidence for the formation of host-guest inclusion compounds (ICs) was provided using CP/MAS solids NMR spectroscopy and complexation-induced chemical shift (CIS) values of 1H/19F nuclei in aqueous solution. The β-CD/PFC ICs displayed variable guest geometry and hydration states as determined by the host-guest stoichiometry and the conformation of the guest. PFOA and SPFO form 1:1 and 2:1 ICs with β-CD, wherein the guest adopts a range of gauche and trans conformations, respectively. 1:1 host-guest complexes were concluded for short perfluorocarbon chains (i.e., PFBA) where the gauche conformation of the PFC guest in the bound state was favoured. In the second theme (chapters 6–8), β-CD based copolymers were used as host materials. The structural characterization of a soluble poly-CD material (known as HDI-1) revealed that the solution behaviour of such polymeric hosts are sensitive to the presence of guest compounds such as p-nitrophenol (PNP) (i.e. chemo-responsive), as well as temperature variations (i.e. thermo-responsive). The host-guest chemistry of the soluble poly-CD material, as studied by 2-D solution NMR and induced circular dichroism (ICD) spectroscopy, indicates that PNP was bound within the cavity sites of β-CD and the interstitial domains of the copolymer (cf. Scheme 1.6 and chapter 6). The observed responsive nature of such polymeric host materials to temperature variation and chemical potential resembles behaviour characteristic of ‘smart materials’. Herein, ‘smart materials’ refer to systems which are responsive to external stimuli (e.g. temperature and chemical). The adsorption properties of the soluble (HDI-1) and insoluble (HDI-3 and -6) poly-CD adsorbents with octyl and perfluorooctyl carboxylate and sulfonate anions were estimated using the Sips and BET models. The hydrocarbon (HC) and fluorocarbon (FC) anions form monolayer and multilayer structures at the surface of the polymeric adsorbents, respectively. The formation of layered structures was controlled by the relative hydrophobicity of the alkyl/perfluoroalkyl chains and their mutual miscibility with the adsorbent surface. Other factors include the inductive effects of the alkyl/perfluoroalkyl head groups and their interactions with aqueous solvent or dipolar domains of the adsorbent surface. The adsorbed species at the liquid-solid interface were characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy, thermal analyses, and contact angle.},

Η μελέτη που λαμβάνει χώρα είναι παραμετρική καθώς εξετάζονται δύο ΥΚ με διαφορετικό βαθμό μοριακής πολικότητας, νανοσωματίδια διαφορετικής μορφολογίας όπως και μεσοφάσεις διαφορετικής συμμετρίας. Κεντρικές παράμετροι της μελέτης είναι το κλάσμα μάζας των νανοσωματιδίων στην υγροκρυσταλλική μήτρα και η θερμοκρασία. Αρχικά, παρουσιάζεται η «κρίσιμη» εισαγωγή αταξίας στον ΥΚ 5ΟΟ8, ο οποίος χαρακτηρίζεται από μικρό βαθμό μοριακής πολικότητας, με το κλάσμα μάζας σφαιρικών νανοσωματιδίων CdSe/ZnS. Προσδιορίστηκαν οι παράμετροι τάξης προσανατολισμού των νανοσύνθετων συστημάτων διαφορετικής συγκέντρωσης, συναρτήσει της θερμοκρασίας στη Ν φάση μέσω πολωτικής φασματοσκοπίας micro-Raman, χρησιμοποιώντας μία μέθοδο η οποία μέχρι σήμερα είχε εφαρμοστεί μόνο σε καθαρούς ΥΚ. Ο βαθμός τάξης, προσδιορίστηκε ανεξάρτητα και από δεδομένα διπλοθλαστικότητας. Η παρουσία των CdSe/ZnS, εισάγει ελαστικές παραμορφώσεις στον ΥΚ οι οποίες υποκινούνται από την ισχυρή ακτινική πρόσδεση των μεσογόνων στις διεπιφάνειες τους με τα νανοσωματίδια. ΄Οταν το κλάσμα μάζας των νανοσωματιδίων τοποθετείται σε μία «κρίσιμη» περιοχή, οι μεταξύ τους αποστάσεις γίνονται αρκούντως μικρές, ώστε η παραμόρφωση να επεκταθεί σε μακροσκοπικό επίπεδο. Το φαινόμενο αυτό, περιγράφεται ως μία μετάπτωση μεταξύ μίας «ομοιόμορφης» και μίας «παραμορφωμένης» ως προς τον προσανατολισμό της Ν φάσης. Στο όριο της «παραμορφωμένης» διαμόρφωσης, η αταξία έρχεται σε κορεσμό και η παράμετρος τάξης μειώνεται δραματικά. Τα πειραματικά αποτελέσματα, εξηγούνται μέσω ενός φαινομενολογικού μοντέλου μέσου πεδίου, σύμφωνα με το οποίο τα νανοσωματίδια εισάγουν ένα διαταρακτικό δυναμικό «τυχαίου πεδίου» το οποίο εφαρμόζεται στον τανυστή τάξης του ΥΚ και δύναται να οδηγήσει σε μεγάλη μείωση της παραμέτρου τάξης πέρα από ένα κατώφλι συγκέντρωσης, για μία σχετικά τυπική ένταση διεπιφανειακών αλληλεπιδράσεων. Στον δεύτερο ερευνητικό άξονα, ο ΥΚ 5ΟΟ8 εξετάζεται ως προς τη Ν τάξη και τα χαρακτηριστικά δομής των σμηγματικών του φάσεων, όταν σε αυτόν διασπείρονται υπερφθοριωμένα νανοπλακίδια πυριτίας PFS. Επιπλέον, ελέγχονται οι μεταπτώσεις καθώς και η θερμοκρασιακή σταθερότητα των φάσεων των υβριδικών συστημάτων. Τα νανοπλακίδια οδηγούν σε ασθενή προοδευτική μείωση της παραμέτρου τάξης προσανατολισμού του 5ΟΟ8. Ειδικότερα, αυτά από τη μία δύναται να οργανώνονται στο μεσομορφικό περιβάλλον, ενώ από την άλλη είναι φοβικά στον ΥΚ εξασθενώντας την τάξη κοντά στις μεταξύ τους διεπιφάνειες. Παράλληλα, ο ΥΚ υφίσταται ελαστικές παραμορφώσεις για να τα ενσωματώσει στον όγκο του. Στα μείγματα 5OO8-PFS, η θερμοκρασία μετάπτωσης μεταξύ ισότροπης και Ν φάσης (Ι-Ν), εμφανίζει μη-μονότονη εξάρτηση από το κλάσμα μάζας των νανοσωματιδίων. Αποδεικνύεται για πρώτη φορά πειραματικώς, ότι αυτή η τάση πηγάζει από φαινόμενα ήπιας συσσωμάτωσης των νανοσωματιδίων και μάλιστα είναι απόλυτα συνδεδεμένη με την ποιότητα μικροδομής των δοκιμίων. Αντίστοιχη συμπεριφορά, εμφανίζει και το εύρος συνύπαρξης Ι-Ν, το οποίο διευρύνεται μη-μονότονα. Μάλιστα, προέκυψε τόσο μέσω πειραμάτων πολωτικής μικροσκοπίας, όσο και θερμιδομετρίας, ότι οι μεταβολές των δύο μεγεθών είναι συσχετισμένες εμφανίζοντας γραμμική εξάρτηση. Με σκοπό να εξηγηθούν οι αποκλίσεις των θερμικών μεγεθών από τη μονοτονία αλλά και οι γραμμικές μεταβολές τους με διαφορετική κλίση στα όρια μικρών και μεγάλων συγκεντρώσεων, προτάθηκε ότι οι αλληλεπιδράσεις που επάγονται στις διεπιφάνειες ΥΚ-νανοσωματιδίων και οδηγούν στις γραμμικές μεταβολές της θερμοκρασίας μετάπτωσης και του εύρους συνύπαρξης, εμφανίζουν εξάρτηση από το λόγο επιφάνειας-προς-όγκο των νανοσωματιδίων, ο οποίος μειώνεται όταν αυτά οργανώνονται σε μεγαλύτερες νανοδομές, αναχαιτίζοντας τις ευνοούμενες μεταβολές. Παρόλο που τα νανοπλακίδια ελαττώνουν την τάξη προσανατολισμού, αυτά ενισχύουν θερμοκρασιακά τη SmA φάση, καθώς και το εύρος των στοιβάδων της. Η αξιοσημείωτη θερμοκρασιακή διεύρυνση που παρατηρήθηκε ακόμα και σε μικρά κλάσματα μάζας νανοσωματιδίων, προτείνεται ότι έχει τις ρίζες της στην οργάνωση των νανοπλακιδίων μεταξύ των σμηγματικών στοιβάδων. Τα PFS προάγουν μία μεταθετική τάξη η οποία μπορεί να συζευχθεί με τη Ν οργάνωση σταθεροποιώντας την SmA θερμοκρασιακά. Ο τελευταίος άξονας της έρευνας επικεντρώνεται στην επίδραση των κβαντικών τελειών CdSe/ZnS στην τάξη και τα χαρακτηριστικά φάσης του ΥΚ 8CB, του οποίου τα μόρια εμφανίζουν μεγαλύτερου βαθμού πολικότητα από αυτά του 5ΟΟ8. Παρατηρήθηκε συστηματικά, ότι τα νανοσωματίδια μπορούν να διασπείρονται επαρκώς στον 8CB σε ένα εύρος κλασμάτων μάζας, μικρότερο από ένα «κρίσιμο κατώφλι», πέρα από το οποίο, ανάλογα με τα ερεθίσματα που λαμβάνει το σύστημα, διαφορετικά σενάρια μπορεί να πραγματοποιηθούν. Περνώντας το κατώφλι, αν ακόμα ευνοείται η διασπορά των νανοσωματιδίων, ο ΥΚ είναι αρκούντως πυκνός σε νανοσωματίδια ώστε να λαμβάνει χώρα η μετάπτωση μεταξύ της «ομοιόμορφης» και της «παραμορφωμένης» Ν φάσης που αναδείχθηκε στα συστήματα 5OO8-CdSe/ZnS. Παρ’ όλ ’ αυτά, υπάρχει αυξημένη πιθανότητα να καλλιεργηθούν οι συνθήκες που οδηγούν στο σχηματισμό δικτύων νανοσωματιδίων, κλασματοειδούς μορφολογίας. Σε αυτήν την περίπτωση ο ΥΚ εκτίθεται σε φαινόμενα χωρικού περιορισμού και αλλάζει άρδην την απόκρισή του. Η παρουσία δικτύων, τα οποία εμφανίζουν και οπτική δραστηριότητα καθώς πάνω τους εγκλωβίζεται ΥΚ, διαπιστώνεται μέσω πολωτικής οπτικής μικροσκοπίας και μικροσκοπίας φθορισμού, ενώ τεκμηριώνεται μέσω πειραμάτων περίθλασης ακτίνων-Χ. Στα φάσματα περίθλασης, των μειγμάτων συγκέντρωσης που υπερβαίνει το κρίσιμο κατώφλι, εμφανίζονται δύο χαρακτηριστικές κορυφές που σχετίζονται με τα νανοσωματίδια και διαχωρίζουν τις καταστάσεις διασποράς και δικτύωσης αντίστοιχα. ΄Οταν τα κλάσματα μάζας των νανοσωματιδίων είναι αρκετά σημαντικά, οι δύο αυτές κορυφές συνυπάρχουν υποδηλώνοντας ότι ένα μέρος των νανοσωματιδίων συνεργεί στη δόμηση του δικτύου, ενώ τα υπόλοιπα διασπείρονται στον ΥΚ που εντοπίζεται στον ελεύθερο χώρο. Στην περίπτωση διασποράς, οι μεταβολές της θερμοκρασίας μετάπτωσης Ι-Ν και του εύρους συνύπαρξης, είναι συσχετισμένες επιβεβαιώνοντας τα αποτελέσματα που προέκυψαν στα μείγματα 5OO8-PFS. Αντίθετα, με το σχηματισμό δικτύων, η γραμμική συσχέτιση έρχεται σε κορεσμό. Η διαφορετική φυσική απόκριση των συστημάτων ΥΚ με δίκτυα νανοσωματιδίων, αποτυπώνεται στον τρόπο εκδήλωσης της μετάπτωσης Ι-Ν, καθώς η θερμοκρασία αλλαγής φάσης εμφανίζει υστέρηση για το υλικό που βρίσκεται πάνω στα δίκτυα και εκτός αυτών. Ο χωρικός περιορισμός στον οποίο εκτίθεται ο ΥΚ, οδηγεί σε συμπίεση του εύρους της Ν φάσης, αυξανομένης της πυκνότητας του δικτύου. Η παρουσίαση αποτελεσμάτων που αφορούν συστημάτα ΥΚ με δίκτυα νανοσωματιδίων, αν και υπερβαίνει τους στόχους της παρούσας διατριβής, λαμβάνει χώρα με σκοπό να πυροδοτήσει το ενδιαφέρον για περαιτέρω επιστημονική έρευνα σε αυτήν την κατεύθυνση. ; Nematic (N) liquid crystals (LCs) made of rod-like nanomolecules of anisotropic shape combine the ﬂuidity of the ordinary ﬂuids with the long-range orientational order, while smectics (Sm) possess also 1D translational order. Thermotropic LCs exhibit one or more mesophases between the crystalline solid and the isotropic liquid. Due to their long-range orientational ordering, NLCs exhibit orientationally dependent properties at the macroscopic level which combined with their ﬂuid nature make them vulnerable to external electromagnetic ﬁelds and mechanical stresses. On the other hand, nanoparticles (NPs) of diﬀerent types exhibit unique properties diﬀerent from their macroscopic counterparts, such as quantum conﬁnement eﬀects and large surface-to-volume ratio and therefore they attract signiﬁcant interest mainly oriented towards the formation of nanocomposite materials with groundbreaking properties. The combination of LCs and NPs conducts to novel soft nanomaterials which share the properties of their components and boost the potential of LCs in the ﬁeld of applications. In this context, the investigation of the impact of nanoparticles on the liquid-crystalline order comprises the basis for the deep understanding of the general physical response of the nanocomposite anisotropic ﬂuids. In this thesis we present a systematic experimental study which investigates the impact of nanoparticles upon the liquid-crystalline ordering while also deals with their eﬀects on LC phase transitions. The study is parametric since we examine two LC components that diﬀer with respect to their molecular polarity, NPs of diﬀerent morphology, as well as mesophases of diﬀerent symmetry. Crucial parameters of this investigation are the mass fraction of NPs in the host LC and the temperature. Initially, we present the CdSe/ZnS induced disorder in the LC compound 5OO8 characterized by low degree of molecular polarity, which is controlled by NPs mass fraction in the host material. We have determined the orientational order parameters of 5OO8-CdSe/ZnS mixtures of diﬀerent concentrations as functions of the temperature in the N phase, by polarized micro-Raman spectroscopy using a well-known method for the ﬁrst time applied in nanocomposite LCs. The degree of the N ordering has been also determined independently by birefringence measurements. The presence of NPs induces elastic deformations in 5OO8 as a result of the random homeotropic anchoring at LC-NP interfaces. When the NPs mass fraction enters a crossover their mean distances become quite small and the elastically-driven disorder is expanded over the macroscopic level. This phenomenon has been described as a transition between a “homogeneous” and a “distorted” N phase. In the “distorted” regime, the disorder is saturated and the N order parameter is dramatically decreased. The experimental observations are described by a simple mean ﬁeld phenomenological model considering a NP induced interfacial “random-ﬁeld” term acting as a perturbation in the classical interaction potential of LCs. According to this model, above the crossover condition NPs lead to an abrupt decrease of the N ordering for a typical strength of LC-NP interfacial interactions. The second research axis of this thesis orients around the investigation of the N ordering and the Sm structural properties of 5OO8, when this LC is combined with superhydrophobic perﬂuorinated silica (PFS) nanoplatelets. Moreover, the phase behavior of the nanocomposite systems of diﬀerent NPs mass fractions has been investigated. It has been found that the PFS nanoplatelets conduct to a slight decrease of the degree of orientational ordering of 5OO8, even for quite signiﬁcant mass fractions. Particularly, on the one hand PFS can be organized in the LC environment promoting the ordering, while on the other hand they are LC-phobic decreasing the ordering close to the LC-NP interfaces. The latter has been veriﬁed by wetting experiments. In parallel, LC undergoes elastic deformations to incorporate PFS in its body. It has been found that the isotropic-nematic (I-N) transition temperature (TIN) of the mixtures exhibits systematically a non-monotonic dependency on the NPs mass fraction. It has been for the ﬁrst time veriﬁed experimentally that this behavior stems from the tendency of PFS to form small aggregates and therefore it is intimately related to the quality of the microstructure of the nanocomposite samples. That is, the more PFS are dispersed in LC volume without aggregating, the more the TIN decreases. Analogous behavior, exhibits the I-N coexistence width (TI+N), which increases non-monotonically with PFS mass fraction. Unexpectedly, it has been deduced by polarizing optical microscopy and calorimetric studies that the variations of TIN and TI+N are quantitatively correlated obeying to linear laws. In order to explain the aberrations of TIN and TI+N from monotony, as well as their linear variations with diﬀerent slopes at the diﬀerent concentration regimes, we have proposed that the interfacial interactions of LC with nanoplatelets that lead to linear variations of TIN and TI+N depend on the surface-to-volume ratio of NPs which decreases when NPs organize themselves to form bigger particles (in the simplest case nanocylinders). Despite the fact that NPs decrease the orientational ordering, they were found to further stabilize SmA phase. The signiﬁcant enhancement of SmA width is speculated to be related with the NPs organization between the Sm layers. Nanoplatelets promote their own translational ordering which can be coupled with the N one, stabilizing the SmA over wider temperature windows even for relatively low PFS concentrations. The third and ﬁnal part of the thesis is devoted in the investigation of the impact of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots on the orientational order and the structural properties of the LC 8CB whose molecules exhibit higher degree of polarity compared to 5OO8. It has been systematically observed that NPs can be adequately dispersed in 8CB over a concentration regime below a “critical threshold” (crossover) above which, depending on the stimulations receiving the system, diﬀerent scenarios can be realized. On crossing the crossover, if NPs dispersion is still fostered, LC is quite dense in NPs and therefore the transition between a “homogeneous” and a “distorted” N phase, also observed in case of 5OO8 with the same NPs, is realized. However, in this regime, there is an increased probability the adequate conditions to be cultivated in order the NPs to get organized in fractal-like structures. In such a case, LC is subject to spatial conﬁnement eﬀects. The NPs structures trap LC and therefore exhibit optical activity. They can be observed by polarizing optical and ﬂuorescence microscopy, but their presence is veriﬁed by X-ray diﬀraction experiments. In the case that NPs are dispersed in 8CB, the variations of TIN and TI+N are quantitatively correlated, verifying the results also observed in 5OO8-PFS mixtures. In the contrary, when NPs form microscopically observed structures the linear correlation saturates. The diﬀerent physical behaviour exhibiting the nanocomposite LCs in which NPs are organized in fractal-like structures is reﬂected in the diﬀerent way that I-N transition is realized. In particular, TIN exhibits hysteresis for the material trapped in the structures and for that in the free space. The presentation of results concerning nanocomposite LC system in which NPs organization leads to conﬁnement eﬀects, exceeds the initial goals of this thesis, however, we present some preliminary results in order to trigger the interest for future research in this direction. By tuning quantum dots organization in LCs we could pave the way for novel soft nanomaterials for outstanding photonic applications.},

Including high adhesion surface, low adhesion superhydrophobic surface and slippery surface mimic rose petal, lotus leaf and nepenthes pitcher plant respectively. Surfaces with different roughness were fabricated by assembling silica nanoparticles and sacrificial ethosome-like catanionic vesicle template on glass substrates. Electrostatic layer-by-layer (ELbL) assembly process was used. Fraction of vesicle in silica nanoparticle suspension and number of deposition layer are main control variables. After modification with a perfluorosilane, a variety of water adhesion properties created. Water microdroplet transport from bottom surfaces with different adhesion to a top surface with the highest adhesion was then systematically investigated. Moreover, stable and highly transparent slippery surface can be achieved by infusing fluorinated lubricant Fomblin® Y into the porous silanized nanoparticulate thin film. The results showed that different rough surfaces with tunable adhesion can be created. Including high adhesion surfaces like rose petal, low adhesion surfaces like lotus leaf. Using those surfaces on microdroplet transport, criteria of no-loss microdroplet transport (θR ≥ 106o and θH ≤ 59o) were finally proposed based on the adhesion properties. Moreover, stable and highly transparent slippery surfaces can be prepared. The optimized slippery surface exhibited highly transparency (average transmittance = 94.6%) and liquid repellency against seven pure liquid with surface tension from 72.8mN/m to 18.6mN/m.},

abstract={Thesis (Ph. D.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Physics, 2006. ; Includes bibliographical references (p. 287-304). ; The Transformer Coupled Toroidal Plasma (TCTP) source uses a high power density plasma formed in a toroidal-shaped chamber by transformer coupling using a magnetic core. The objectives of the thesis are (1) to characterize the TCTP source, (2) to understand the kinetics and limitations of species production by the remote TCTP source, and (3) to construct a generic model of plasma-surface interactions. By fitting the rovibrational bands of diatomic molecules such as N2, the temperatures of neutral gases were determined in the TCTP source. This was the first measurement of the neutral gas temperature of a high power density plasma in a toroidal geometry. An argon plasma was found to be around 2000K for a power density of 5 W/cm3. To avoid the necessity of N2 addition, the use of the C2 Swan bands of ( 3 3 d?g?a?u) were used to determine the neutral gas temperature of fluorocarbon plasmas. In a C2F6 discharge at a power density of 15 W/cm3, rotational and translational temperatures above 5000K were observed while vibrational temperatures above 8000K were found. The temperature measurements using C2 molecules were validated by the addition of N2 to the discharge and the caparison between the rotational temperatures of C2 and N2. These high neutral gas temperatures were justified by a power balance calculation that considered the thermal conduction, convection, ion bombardment, and dissociation energy losses. A linear dependence of the neutral gas temperature with the plasma power was found and is consistent with thermal and convention energy losses, where in both, the power loss linearly scales with the gas temperature. ; (cont.) The thesis systematically measured the dependence of plasma parameters, such as the neutral gas temperature, the electron temperature, the electron density and the species concentration, on the operational conditions of the plasma. A good match was observed between the experimental measurements and the rediction of a simplified global plasma model. The plasma model included the heating of the electron gas by a uniform electric field, the loss of energy from the gas to determine the electron temperature, ion and electron losses at surfaces, and formation and loss of species by the electron impact and surface recombination. The loss of atomic fluorine to the formation of COF2 was shown to cause the etching rate of oxide films in remote fluorocarbon plasmas to be about one half of that in the nitrogen trifluoride plasma since fluorine atoms are the major etchant of oxide. The addition of 3% N2 was shown to inhibit the formation of COF2 in perfluorocarbon discharges and thereby increase the amount of atomic fluorine supplied to the etching chamber. With the addition of N2, the etching rate of SiO2 and Si increased to rates that were comparable to that of NF3. The fluorocarbon gases were shown to be suitable for replacement of the nitrogen trifluoride for the remote plasma cleaning of chambers. In addition, the fluorocarbon plasmas with N2 addition were shown to possess low global warming gas emissions and clean surfaces (no carbonaceous contamination) after processing. The saturation of the etching rate of the silicon dioxide with the partial pressure of fluorine atoms was also observed for the first time. ; (cont.) In the saturation regime, the extent of F adsorption on the surface approaches its saturation limit and the etching rate is limited by the surface reaction of the adsorbed F with the surface. A new theoretical framework was developed to model the plasma surface kinetics of both etching and deposition processes for any plasma-surface interactions. The model is based on the translation of a mixed-layer on the substrate which is mixed by ion bombardment during the plasma processing. The kinetics of the etching and deposition are based on the assumption that the surface is atomically well mixed by ion bombardment, and therefore the number of any given moiety is computed by its corresponding nearest bonding neighbor probability, based on the elemental compositions of the layer. All major etching characteristics such as the dependence of the etching yield on the neutral to ion flux ratio can be explained by using the generic modeling approach. This model was also the first one to capture the angular dependence of the etching yield, as a result of the competition between the angular dependence of vacancy generation and that of ion induced reactions. ; by Bo Bai. ; Ph.D.},

abstract={Perfluorocarbons have unique and valuable physical properties not found in Nature. By incorporating fluorine into proteins, it might be possible to produce biological molecules with novel and useful properties. Fluorocarbons are intrinsically more hydrophobic than hydrocarbons, and because partitioning of hydrophobic residues out of the aqueous phase is a major driving force in protein folding, are expected to be more stable. This research has focused on the perfluorinated amino acid L-5,5,5,5’,5’,5’-hexafluoroleucine (hFLeu), which has been incorporated into de novo designed peptides. A detailed investigation has been undertaken into the effect on structure and stability of systematically repacking the hydrophobic core of a model protein with hFLeu. The starting point was a 27-residue peptide, a4-H, that adopts an antiparallel 4-a-helix bundle structure, and in which the hydrophobic core comprise six layers of leucine residues introduced at the "a" and "d" positions of the canonical heptad repeat. A series of peptides were synthesized in which the central two (a4-F2), four (a4-F4), or all six layers (a4-F6) of the core were substituted hFLeu. The free energy of unfolding increases proportionally by ~0.3 (kcal/mol)/hFLeu on repacking the hydrophobic layers, so that a4-F6 is ~35% more stable than the nonfluorinated protein a4-H. One-dimensional proton, two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC, and 19F NMR spectroscopies were used to examine the effect of fluorination on the conformational dynamics of the peptide. Metal-peptide complexes have been synthesized from small peptide building blocks and cadmium ions resulting in some novel extended crystalline molecules. Metal-peptide complexes are of interest due to their potential applications for drug delivery, organic and biomimetic catalysts, ionic channels, chiral separating materials, food additives, and pharmaceutical purposes. Six cadmium complexes were crystallized using the di-peptides L-ala-L-ala, L-ala-L-thr, L-pro-L-ala, and L-pro-L-leu, or the tri-peptides gly-gly-gly and L-ala-L-ala-L-ala as organic linkers that form either one-dimensional or two-dimensional extended networks.

abstract={Integrating renewable energy sources into the electricity grid has caused an essential need for large-scale energy storage systems. To fulfill this purpose, redox flow batteries (RFBs) are considered one of the best options to be employed in medium- to large-scale applications. As novel and rapidly growing RFB technologies, zinc-iodine redox flow batteries (ZIFB) exhibit great potential for high energy density large-scale energy storage. However, their practical use has been limited by their poor stability, low efficiency, and high cost. In addition, capacity fade and elusive operational instability over charge-discharge cycling severely hinder their large-scale commercialization of ZIFBs. This thesis focuses on the design and engineering of electrolytes and membranes for durable and low-cost ZIFBs to pave the way for future electrolyte research in high-energy-density storage systems. In the first study, we implemented a novel strategy to improve the performance and cyclability of ZIFBs, as well as decrease the chemical cost, by utilizing ammonium-based electrolytes. The designed ammonium chloride supported zinc-iodine redox flow battery (AC-ZIFB) achieved a high energy density of 137 Wh/L, Coulombic efficiency of ~99%, energy efficiency of ~80%, and a cycle-life of 2,500 cycles at an 11-times lower chemical cost than conventional ZIFBs. Such improvements were mainly attributed to the multifunctional roles of cost-effective chemicals utilized in a new decoupled electrolyte design, which mitigates the zinc dendrite formation, facilitates the anodic and cathodic reaction kinetics, and unlocks extra capacity with the primary aid of I₂Cl⁻. The new design empowered the AC-ZIFB with excellent potential as a robust and practical redox flow battery and more broadly demonstrates a facile strategy of using multifunctional electrolyte chemistry to achieve a reliable, high-performance, and cost-competitive energy storage system. However, when the costly perfluorinated Nafion membrane was replaced with low-cost porous membranes, the AC-ZIFBs suffered from capacity fade and elusive operational instability over charge-discharge cycling, which hinders their successful penetration into the market. Thus, the next two studies focus on the design and engineering of AC-ZIFBs with low-cost porous polyolefin membranes. In the second study, the capacity fade in AC-ZIFBs with porous polyolefin (PE) membranes was investigated by systematically evaluating electrochemical performance and electrolyte properties. It was found that the differential hydraulic pressure at both sides of the porous membrane leads to colossal electrolyte transport from catholyte to anolyte via convection. Consequently, an accumulation of (poly)iodide at the negative side is established as cycling proceeds, leading to substantial capacity fade of the flow cells. To remediate the capacity fade, an effective strategy was proposed by adjusting electrolyte flow rate ratios to regulate the induced convection by balancing the hydraulic pressure. Theoretical calculations and experimental analysis confirmed that an asymmetric flow rate condition drastically inhibits catholyte transport and (poly)iodide crossover. Therefore, a strategically designed AC-ZIFB with an optimal catholyte to anolyte flow rate ratio of 1 to 7 was able to achieve energy efficiency (EE) of 82% and cycle life of 1,100 cycles at a high current density of 80 mA/cm², which is the highest performance of all the reported ZIFBs. The insight gained into the capacity fade mechanism and the proposed methodology to sustain capacity substantially benefit the commercialization of flow batteries, particularly ZIFBs. In the last study, to combat the convection and subsequent capacity decay, new negative electrolyte (anolyte) chemistries with organic compounds, namely urea and glucose were designed to balance the hydraulic pressure, thereby restricting pressure-dependent active ion transfer across the membrane. In this new design, the urea-supported anolyte was able to triple the lifetime of AC-ZIFBs, while the glucose-based design inhibited the large electrolyte transport and prolonged their cycle life by 25 times. Besides the positive impact of organic additives in balancing the hydraulic pressure, the Zn/Zn²⁺ half-cell study and AC-ZIFB full cell study indicated that both additives also could facilitate zinc reaction kinetics and decrease the ionic resistance of flow batteries, thus improve the electrochemical performance. The glucose-supported AC-ZIFBs with 1.5 M glucose additive achieved outstanding Coulombic efficiency of ~95% and energy efficiency of ~78% under the current density of 80 mA/cm², at a cost below 150 US$ kW/h with discharge times of 8 h. Such improvements in the performance are mainly attributed to the remarkable ability of the designed organic additive-supported anolyte to alleviate electrolyte transport and mitigate capacity decay, all with minimal effect on the cost of the battery system. This straightforward yet impactful strategy to balance electrolyte pressure with the aid of electrolyte chemistries could enable an economically viable scale-up of long-lasting ZIFBs.},

abstract={Proton transport in proton exchange membranes (PEMs) depends on interaction between water and acid groups covalently bound to the polymer. Although the presence of water is important in maintaining the PEM’s functions, a thorough understanding of this topic is still lacking. The objective of this work is to provide a better understanding of how the nature water, confined to ionic domains of the polymer, influences the membrane’s ability to transport protons, methanol and water. Understanding this topic will facilitate development of new materials with favorable transport properties for fuel cells use. Five classes of polymer membranes were used in this work: polyacrylonitrile-graft-poly(styrenesulfonic) acid (PAN-g-macPSSA); poly(vinylidene difluoride) irradiation-graft-poly(styrenesulfonic) acid (PVDF-g-PSSA); poly(ethylenetetrafluoroethylene) irradiation-graft- poly(styrenesulfonic) acid (ETFE-g-PSSA); PVDF-g-PSSA with hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA); and perfluorosulfonic acid membrane (Nafion). The nature of water within the polymers (freezable versus non-freezable states) was measured by systematically freezing samples, and observing the temperature at which water freezes and the amount of heat released in the process. Freezing water-swollen membranes resulted in a 4-fold decrease in the proton conductivity of the PEM. Activation energies of prot on transport before and after freezing were ~ 0.15 eV and 0.5 eV, consistent with proton transport through liquid water and bound water, respectively. Reducing the content of water in membrane samples decreased the amount of freezable and non-freezable water. Calorimetric measurements of membranes in various degrees of hydration showed that water molecules became non-freezable when ƒÜ (water molecules per sulfonic acid group) was less than ~14. Proton conduction through membranes containing only non-freezable water was demonstrated to be feasible. Diffusion experiments showed that the permeability of methanol decreased when the content of free water in the membranes decreased. Variation in permeability trends observed for the different polymer classes of the same content of free water was explained on the basis of tortuosity and interaction of methanol within the ionic network. Finally, a novel set of polymers containing non-ionic hydrophilic segments were examined for enhanced water transport in order to see if such domains might offset the flux of water due to electro-osmosis.},

abstract={© 2012 Dr. Nicole Joy Rijs ; Copper is a highly useful metal for mediating organic reactions, and silver and gold are also gaining attention for their specialized reactivity in organic synthetic applications. Despite the steady use of these metals in reagents, their mechanism of reaction is not always fully understood. This is not ideal for their optimal use. In this thesis, a combination of gas phase mass spectrometric based experiments, and computational chemistry has been used to unravel some of the reaction mechanisms of group 11 reagents ions. This has allowed for a systematic approach to studying their intrinsic reactivity. As organometallic reagents are difficult to study via direct electrospray, a “double decarboxylation” approach has been applied to generate desired organometallates. Thus, the gas phase thermal decomposition of group 11 metal acetates, competing side reactions, and the effect of organic ligands or metal center on observed reactivity are investigated. The success or failure to form specific organometallate species is evaluated. A key to utilizing organometallic reagents is limiting their thermal decomposition. The thermal decomposition of a range of group 11 organometallates incorporating different organoligands is surveyed. Comparison between metal center (M = Cu, Ag and Au) and organoligand effects on decomposition are made. Comparison between condensed phase and gas phase decomposition behavior are also drawn. In addition, the effectiveness of computational methods to accurately predict the energies of homolytic bond dissociation are benchmarked against experimental data and a computational gold standard. Since there is great interest in developing better trifluoromethylation reagents the installation of perfluoro methyl ligands via the double decarboxylation approach was investigated. In addition, the thermal decomposition of the resultant perfluoro organometallate species was surveyed. These decompositions occur via numerous pathways, dependant on the metal center. Decomposition of trifluoromethylated copper was facile, highlighting the challenges facing condensed phase chemists in this field attempting to utilize perfluoro organocuprate reagents. Carbon-carbon bond coupling reactions are an essential process mediated by organometallic reagents. Thus, a model reaction of the allylic alkylation in the gas phase was investigated with dimethylcuprate, dimethylargentate and dimethylaurate. The intrinsic reactivity of these ions reflected the condensed phase reactivity profile, with the cuprate being the superior nucleophillic reagent. The development of catalytic decarboxylation reactions for applications in synthetic chemistry have attracted considerable recent interest. In an extension to the model allylic alkylation reaction, the catalytic decarboxylative allylic alkylation reaction of dimethylcuprate and allyl acetate is studied. This thesis systematically examines in the gas phase the effects on organometallate reactivity due to the (1) metal center, (2) organo or carboxylate ligand, (3) fluorination of the reagent, (4) substrate and (5) leaving group. These are synthetically valuable models of unimolecular and bimolecular reactions with organometallate reagents.},

abstract={A systematic study of how various reaction parameters affect the product distribution of gas-solid reactions was carried out in a new reactor of local design. These reactions involve the trifluoromethylation of C60, C70, and the endohedral metallofullerenes Sc3N@C 80 and Y3N@C80; and in particular, the reactions were optimized to favor C60(CF3)2 and C 60(CF3)4. A new solution phase homogeneous perfluoroalkylation method was used to prepare a series of 1,7-C60(RF) 2 compounds with different RF chain lengths and branching patterns. A range of analytical methods including 19F NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy, APCI mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography were used to structurally characterize the compounds. Cyclic voltammetry, DFT E(LUMO) calculations, and gas phase electron affinity (EA) measurements were used to determine the substituent effect of the RF groups. The results conclusively showed that the solution phase E 1/2, calculated E(LUMO), and EA values— that are typically assumed to be correlated for a series of electron acceptors— are not always correlated. Several highly efficient and selective methods were developed for the further functionalization of selected trifluoromethyl fullerenes (TMFs). These new functionalized TMFs were structurally characterized using the aforementioned analytical techniques and the X-ray crystal structures of five new derivatized TMFs were determined. Analysis of the how these newly derivatized TMFs pack in a crystalline solid revealed fullerene density values that were in general twice that of reported fullerenes that pack in the same motifs. These derivatized TMFs also exhibited extended networks of short C˙˙˙C distances between fullerene cages of adjacent molecules that has been correlated to increased free charge carrier motilities in organic photovoltaic device active layers. The solution phase E1/2 values of the most commonly used fullerene derivatives in OPV devices were measured under carefully controlled conditions and revealed that poor reporting of electrochemical conditions, mistakes interpreting electrochemical data, and fullerene impurities have combined to cause significant confusion about the reported electrochemical values in the literature. A preliminary study of 32 OPV devices fabricated with active layers containing perfluoroalkylfullerenes (PFAFs) indicated that (i) PFAFs can function as suitable electron acceptors in OPVs, and (ii) that a more detailed study examining the complex electronic interplay between the fullerene electron acceptor and polymer donor is warranted.},

abstract={Abstract ; The development of new unconventional routes to small functionalized fluorocarbons (FCs) continues to be an attractive target due to the high utility of FCs in a broad range of applications, including their use as refrigerants, solvents, and surfactants. With the phasing out of hydrofluoroalkanes as refrigerants, there is a growing interest in the synthesis of new hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), which are known to have significantly reduced global warming potential relative to hydrofluoroalkanes. Currently, energy-intensive conditions and toxic starting materials are typically necessary for their syntheses, making these processes environmentally problematic. The approach we have proposed for alternative ‘greener’ methods for functionalized FC production targets a transition metal-catalyzed synthesis involving the formation of metallacyclic intermediates through the oxidative cycloaddition of simple fluorinated alkenes, e.g., tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and trifluoroethylene (TrFE), at low-valent nickel centres. There is precedent for the generation of short fluoroalkyl chain (C4-C6) compounds through homogeneous catalysis. For example, Baker et al. showed that you could catalytically hydrodimerize two molecules of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) or one molecule of TFE with one molecule of ethylene using low valent Ni catalysts and π-acidic monodentate ancillary ligands, affording octafluorobutane and 1,1,2,2-tetrafluorobutane respectively. The objective of this Thesis is to further the state-of-the-art in fluoroorganometallic chemistry by gaining a deeper understanding of transition metal fluoroalkyl complexes as a function of metal-fluoroalkyl and carbon-fluorine bond reactivity. The over-arching goal is to harness said reactivity for the synthesis of new value-added fluorocarbons. Due to the robust nature of carbon-fluorine and metal-fluoroalkyl bonds in transition metal fluoroalkyl complexes, intensive conditions are often necessary to achieve any reactivity. Recently, bifunctional ligands have proven to be useful at effecting challenging transformations through unconventional ligand-assisted substrate activation pathways. Chapters 2 and 3 herein explore the use of a bidentate phosphinothiol ligand in the context of perfluoronickelacyclopentane reactivity. Synthetic approaches for the formation of phosphinothioether- and phosphinothiolate-supported perfluorometallacycles are outlined along with ensuing reactivity studies, including examples of Cα-F, Cβ-F, and Ni-Cα bond activation. Furthermore, a metal-mediated synthesis of functionalized FC, (E)-1,2,3,3,4,4-hexafluoro-1-butene, is provided. Chapter 4 sheds light on the comparatively underdeveloped chemistry of fluorinated nickelacycles generated from TrFE. A systematic study of monodentate phophine and phosphite ligand effects on metallacyclopentane regio-/stereochemistry is presented. The behaviour of the generated hydrofluoronickelacyclopentanes in the presence of acidic additives allows for a direct analogy to be made regarding the effects of the extent of metallacycle fluorination on C-F and Ni-C activation. In search of new approaches to novel functionalized FC synthesis, Chapter 5 will re-visit the use of bifunctional ligands, investigating the formation and reactivity of new perfluoronickelacycles featuring [P,NH] and [P,Nˉ] bidentate ligands. Finally, Chapter 6 summarizes the findings of this Thesis and discusses some of the future opportunities that will build on this work. The increased understanding of the stoichiometric systems presented herein will be directly important to the development of nickel-catalyzed routes to HFOs. As the demand for new “greener” refrigerants and propellants increases, the synthesis of small-molecule functionalized FCs using transition metal catalysis and waste fluorinated feedstocks can offer a mild, atom economical approach to new, unique candidates that will be appealing to industrial partners.},

Based on DFT calculations of numerous structure combinations, I proposed a pentacene and perfluoro-pentacene alternating hybrid structures as a new type of n-type semiconductor. Based on the DFT calculations and Marcus charge transfer theory analysis, the new structure has high charge mobility and can be a promising new n-type organic semiconductor material. DFT calculations have been used to systematically investigate the effect of surface organic absorbate and surface defects on the work function of ZnO. It was found that increasing surface coverage of organic groups and decreasing surface defects lead to decrease of work functions, in excellent agreement with experimental results.

abstract={Doctor of Philosophy ; Department of Chemistry ; Christer Aakeroy ; A methodology for estimating hydrogen-bond preferences and binding affinities in solution, based on molecular electrostatic potential surfaces (MEPS), is presented using tritopic hydrogen bond acceptor and a series of aromatic carboxylic acids. The plot of calculated MEPS values against experimentally determined binding constants produces a goodness-of-fit of over 0.93 and a similar positive correlation is obtained between MEPS values and binding enthalpies. A series of tritopic N-heterocyclic compounds were synthesized and subjected to systematic co-crystallizations with selected multi-topic aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids to determine if ditopic and tritopic donors formulate assemblies with desired stoichiometries. The co-crystals formed contained the COOHᐧᐧᐧBzim synthon, and we observe vacant sites on the acceptor molecules. A series of co-crystallizations between tritopic N-heterocyclic compounds and perfluoroiodoarenes were carried to map out structural landscapes. At least one potential binding site on the acceptor is left vacant on all the four structures obtained. The absence of halogen bonds to all sites can be ascribed primarily due to deactivation of the σ-hole on the iodo-arene donors and partially due to steric hindrance. Four nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs were chosen due to the presence of the COOH moiety, to establish if aqueous solubility can be modulated by systematic solubility measurements of the complex. Two different solids were obtained with a 1:1 and 1:3 stoichiometry. The solubility of the 1:1 co-crystal decreased by 12-fold compared to pure aspirin (3mg/mL at 20 °C) indicating that co-crystals can offer promising new solid forms of pharmaceutically relevant compounds. A series of hydrogen- and halogen bonding Tröger’s base derivatives were synthesized using aromatic N-heterocycles and the iodoethynyl functionality, followed by a series of co-crystallization between aliphatic dicarboxylic acids and symmetric ditopic acceptors. The results suggest that reducing the number of binding sites from three to two facilitates the formation of co-crystals with the desired stoichiometry. The results indicate that directed assembly can be achieved more easily when the molecular building blocks are conformationally rigid.},

abstract={Background. Perfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS) are persistent organic pollutants that accumulate in the fish, wildlife, and humans. In 2013, it has been discovered an area of the Veneto Region in which ground water, surface water, and drinking water were contaminated by PFAS. Appropriate interventions have been undertaken to contain the water pollution, reducing it effectively. However, it has been estimated that the contamination had started about fifty years before its discovery, leading to the long-term exposure of the population. The long-term exposure to PFAS is worrying because PFAS have been suggested to affect human health. Veneto Region has therefore organized a health surveillance programme of the population living in the polluted area. A specific aspect of such programme concerns the maternal and newborn health, which represents the focus of my PhD research project. The aims of the project were to review animal and human evidence related to this topic and to assess the effects of the exposure to PFAS on maternal and newborn health in the population living in the polluted area of Veneto Region. Methods. The systematic review included relevant studies in the English language identified through the online database PubMed. Studies were eligible to the review if they assess the effect of PFAS exposure during the reproductive period on the health of the pregnant women and of the infant. The identification of the outcomes of interest assessed in the study about maternal and newborn health in Veneto Region was based on the systematic review. The outcomes investigated were preeclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (pregnancy complications), and intrauterine growth restriction, evaluated using a proxy of fetal growth, the Small for Gestational Age (SGA) (birth outcomes). The study was performed using an indirect measure of exposure to PFAS, defined as woman’s residence in the contaminated area (including 21 municipalities identified according to a Veneto Region Official Resolution). A control area that included 48 municipalities not exposed to PFAS contamination according to the performance limits of the National Institue of Health was chosen for comparision. The information sources included two administrative datasets, the Veneto Region Birth Registry and the Veneto Region hospital discharge records. For the pregnancy complications (preeclampsia and GDM), a medical chart review of pregnant women hospitalized is ongoing to validate the cases identified from the hospital discharge records. Results. The systematic review led to the retrieval of 1096 records from PubMed. One hundred and thirty-nine records were judged to be eligible to the study. Overall, evidence retrieved suggests that PFAS exposure might affect the health of the pregnant woman and the development of the fetus. The epidemiological study showed that newborns of mothers living in the contaminated area were significantly more likely to be SGA compared to newborns of mothers living in the control area (adjusted Odds Ratio 1.26, 95% C.I. 1.14-1.38). Looking at pregnancy complications (preeclampsia and GDM), preliminary results were available because the review of the medical chart is ongoing. Such preliminary results seem to suggest that the frequency of these pathological conditions is slightly higher in women living in the contaminated area compared to those living in the control ones. However, they must be taken with caution because the validation of preeclampsia and GDM cases is ongoing. Conclusions. The results of the present research project suggest that PFAS exposure might affect maternal and newborn health. The present topic deserves further research, not only from the epidemiological point of view, but also for what concerns the pathophysiological mechanisms potentially involved in the association between PFAS exposure and adverse health outcomes in pregnant women and newborns.},

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a group of emerging contaminants that include perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). PFASs can be released into groundwater through the application of fire-fighting foam, or effluent from industrial locations, wastewater facilities, and landfill leachate. Human exposure to PFASs should be limited due to the potential for human health implications; PFOA and PFOS are linked to liver, gastrointestinal, and thyroid toxic effects. Removal of PFASs from aqueous solutions can occur through capture, oxidation, reduction, or thermolysis. One of the most popular recent methods for the removal of aqueous PFOA in groundwater is thermally-activated persulfate. The goals of this thesis were to (1) evaluate the performance of a fluoride-selective electrode (FSE) in different matrix combinations that were representative of in situ groundwater remediation activities (2) investigate the removal of PFOA and PFOS with the addition of permanganate to thermally-activated or ambient persulfate, and (3) compare the removal of PFOA by thermally-activated or ambient persulfate in different sediment-slurry experiments. A systematic investigation of the impacts of oxidant-based reagents and a quenching agent, aqueous geochemistry, and the presence of sediments was conducted for the FSE, in order to provide guidance on the use of this analytical tool. The hypothesis was that the quantification of fluoride (F-) using an ultrapure water calibration curve would be inaccurate in some of the combinations tested. Using matrix spike recovery and electrode slope measured in the various matrices as indicators, permanganate, ascorbic acid, and sediments were flagged as components of concern. While either a matrix-matched calibration curve or the standard addition method could be used for samples containing permanganate, the presence of sediments or ascorbic acid should be avoided for F- quantification with the FSE. Matrix spike recovery was within the acceptable bounds defined by the USEPA, and the electrode slopes were consistent with the slope of the calibration curve in the presence of persulfate and in different geochemical aqueous phases. The impact of adding permanganate to both thermally-activated (60 °C) and ambient (20 °C) persulfate treatment systems for the removal of PFOA and PFOS was investigated using a 1:100 molar ratio of permanganate: persulfate. It was hypothesized that permanganate, or the manganese dioxide produced from permanganate in the presence of water, might be able to activate persulfate. Sacrificial, aqueous batch reactors prepared in the laboratory were used in this experiment. Analysis was conducted for pH using a pH probe, aqueous F- using the FSE, and aqueous PFASs using solid-phase extraction preparation and liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. PFASs with carbon chain lengths from four to eight were quantified. PFOA was successfully removed (> 99 %) in the thermally-activated persulfate with permanganate (dual-oxidant) and thermally-activated persulfate systems in both ultrapure and sodium bicarbonate simulated groundwater after seven days. Both short-chain PFCAs and aqueous F- were generated and indicated that PFOA was degraded in these experiments. The removal of PFOA was not evident in the ambient dual-oxidant and heated permanganate systems. The mass balance calculations for the PFOA systems accounted for nearly all of the initial PFOA (81 – 142 %). There was no indication of removal of PFOS by any combination of oxidants, and no degradation products were generated. Removal of PFOA or PFOS was not improved in the thermally-activated or ambient persulfate systems with the addition of permanganate at the tested ratio. The challenges for the implementation of thermally-activated persulfate for the removal of PFOA in groundwater settings include the interaction of persulfate and PFOA with the aquifer sediments. The hypothesis of this experiment was that PFOA would be removed and converted into PFCAs and F- with thermally-activated persulfate treatment, even in the presence of sediments. The removal of PFOA by thermally-activated (60 °C) persulfate (50 mM, 9.6 g L-1) was compared using three different sediments in sacrificial sediment-slurry batch reactors. For each reactor, pH, aqueous F-, and aqueous PFCAs were determined, similar to the dual-oxidant experiment. In addition, liquid-solid extraction was used to quantify the sorbed PFASs in the solid phase. At least 60 % of the initial PFOA was removed after seven days in all three sediment slurries using thermally-activated persulfate. Removal of PFOA in all slurry reactors was lower than in aqueous reactors (99 % after 7 days). The detection of degradation products (short-chain PFCAs and F-) was also altered in sediment slurries compared to aqueous reactors. Short-chain PFCAs were retained within the systems longer when sediments were present. The decreased amount of PFCA removal led to the production of less F-. Furthermore, less F- could be measured in the sediments with high carbonate or organic carbon content. PFOA was extracted at higher concentrations from the sediment with the highest organic carbon content under acidic pH conditions. No removal of PFOA was measured under ambient persulfate treatment conditions. Thermally-activated persulfate was still effective for the removal of PFOA from soil-slurry reactors, but at decreased removal efficiency. Thermally-activated persulfate can be considered as a potential remediation method for use in the removal of PFOA in groundwater settings. At the ratio tested, permanganate did not improve the effectiveness of persulfate under thermally-activated or ambient conditions. However, the investigation of a wider range of persulfate to permanganate ratios could provide further information. PFOS removal was not observed in thermally-activated or ambient persulfate treatment conditions. The quantification of degradation products, such as short-chain PFASs and F-, should be included in the analytical suite for any PFAS degradation project. The FSE is a valuable tool for the measurement of aqueous F- concentrations.},

abstract={There have been many theoretical descriptions of the nucleation process but very few detailed experimental research has been carried out. The nucleation process was systematically analysed with the aim of gaining a deeper understanding of foam formation and the nucleation process, in order to develop possibilities in influencing it and to ultimately reduce the thermal conductivity. A method was developed whereby the nucleation process could be observed in-situ and subsequently analysed by means of a PC-controlled camera attached to a stereo microscope. The increase in volume due to foam formation and its exothermic reactivity was taken into consideration. Thereby, the amount of cell nuclei in the initial phase was examinable and cell growth including coalescence could be followed. The initial nuclei compared favourably to the final number of cells and to their size, providing a consistency with real foaming conditions. Detailed research was carried out on the effect of various types and amounts of blowing agents (e.g. carbon dioxide, cyclopentane, perfluoroalkanes), surfactants, catalysts, fillers and isocyanates on the nucleation process. Other important factors influencing the nucleation process are the component's viscosity and surface tension and their relationship with each other during the foaming process. The surface tensions and viscosities of the various systems used were also investigated using several known methods. Perfluorohexane-blown foams have larger nucleation numbers than either CO2- or cyclopentane-blown foams. This is only true when an emulsifier is present. Contrary to the literature, the initial number of nuclei did not vary with respect to surfactant type. Nucleation numbers proved to be independent of surface tensions values proving that lowering the surface tension does not automatically ensure higher nucleation numbers. Surfactants were shown to have either stabilising or emulsifying abilities. An improvement in nucleation numbers was obtained by improving the compatibility of the A- and B-components through the use of prepolymers. One can conclude th at nucleation is a complex heterogeneous process in which surfactants, catalysts and fillers play a minor roll.},

abstract={The drug development process is notoriously long and expensive. During preclinical studies, inaccurate prediction of pharmacokinetic properties such as the ability of a drug candidate to passively permeate cell plasma membranes contributes to the high failure rate of drug candidates during clinical trials. Passive drug permeability is currently predicted using in vitro techniques such as parallel artificial membrane permeability assays, or PAMPA. In PAMPA, drug transport is predicted between aqueous compartments via a synthetic filter filled with a phospholipid solution in an organic solvent. The lack of translatability of preclinical predictions to humans can be attributed, in part, to lack of biological similarly between models used for permeability prediction and cell plasma membranes in vivo. Here, I demonstrate a new method for pharmacokinetic prediction, built by using droplet interface bilayers (DIBs) as human-mimetic artificial cell membranes. DIBs are bilayer sections created at the interface of two aqueous droplets. In the literature, DIBs have been used as artificial cell plasma membranes to study, for example, electrophysiological properties, protein insertion, water permeability, and molecular transport. DIBs can be formed between droplets of differing composition such that one droplet can be used as a donor compartment and the other as an acceptor compartment for the quantification of molecular transport across the artificial cell membrane. DIBs have previously been used to measure the passive permeability of numerous fluorophores as well as the drugs caffeine and doxorubicin. However, the extent to which DIBs have been tuned to mimic human cell plasma membranes and transport across them is limited. I present here the use of microfluidic platforms for bespoke DIB formation, where variables such as temperature, bilayer composition, and droplet contents are customized to create biomimetic cells-on-a-chip. These artificial cells are then used to measure molecular transport with the aim of predicting permeability. In Chapter 2, I investigate the effectiveness of literature methods for the modification of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device channels for aqueous droplet formation and storage. While numerous techniques have been presented as mitigation strategies for common challenges in droplet microfluidics, it is not clear from the literature if any of these methods would be effective or necessary for the formation and analysis of DIBs. With the aim of facilitating aqueous droplet formation, I tested the effect of PDMS silanization using trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (PFOS) on surface hydrophobicity and oleophobicity. To assess their effect on reducing the rate of aqueous droplet evaporation, I tested surface treatment of PDMS with Teflon AF or Aquapel. I also tested modifications to the device fabrication process by bonding a glass coverslip to the surface of the device and soaking the device in water overnight. To quantify changes in PDMS surface chemistry, I performed contact angle measurements, aqueous droplet formation experiments, and measurements of droplet size during on-chip storage. I determined that baking PDMS microfluidic devices at 65 C overnight produced channel surfaces which allowed for aqueous droplet formation and storage. In Chapter 3 I present a systematic study on the role of temperature in DIB formation using naturally derived phospholipids. The use of increased temperature to form DIBs using total lipid extracts has previously been demonstrated, but has never before been investigated systematically using naturally derived phospholipids and bespoke formulations thereof. I hypothesized that, in order to form complete phospholipid monolayers and DIBs, the microfluidic device must be held at the phase transition temperature of the phospholipids. Using a custom-built heating platform, I tested DIB formation over a range of temperatures to determine conditions which allowed DIB formation rather than droplet coalescence. I show that temperature is a key parameter for DIB formation using naturally derived phospholipids in a microfluidic device. In Chapter 4, I demonstrate the use of DIBs as a new type of pharmacokinetic compartment model for intestinal absorption. Using three-droplet networks, the components of which were designed to mimic the intestinal space, the enterocyte cytosol, and the blood, I measured fluorescein permeability across intestine-mimetic DIBs. The model was able to predict the transport of fluorescein more accurately than the current state-of-the-art technique, PAMPA. Chapter 5 describes the development of complex DIB models for pharmacologically relevant membranes as well as an investigation into novel methods of drug transport detection on-chip. I created a new DIB model for the small intestine, incorporating more components of the enterocyte plasma membrane such as cholesterol. Measurement of calcein permeability served as a control experiment, as calcein does not cross cell plasma membranes. Measurement of fluorescein permeability yielded a significantly shorter permeation half-life than was determined in Chapter 4, indicating an increase in permeability with the more complex, biomimetic phospholipid formulation. I also developed sex-specific models for intestinal absorption to investigate the effect of sex-based membrane differences on permeability. This relationship has never before been explored in the literature. In comparison to the initial intestinal phospholipid formulation, the sex-specific formulations contained acyl chain tail groups which have been found in different ratios in male and female cells. A significantly longer half-life for fluorescein permeability was found in female intestine-mimetic DIBs, mirroring the slower drug absorption observed in female patients. I also used DIBs to model blood-brain barrier permeability. I demonstrate this application using two different brain lipid extracts, polar and total brain lipids. Polar brain lipids have previously been used in PAMPA to predict blood-brain barrier permeability, but have been found to overpredict the permeation of charged molecules in comparison to custom lipid formulations which mimic the composition of human brain endothelial cells. Permeability measurements in DIBs formed using polar brain lipids gave results which agree with PAMPA, as DIBs formed using polar brain lipids were permeable to fluorescein, but those formed using total brain lipids were not. Blood-brain barrier-mimetic DIBs formed using either lipid extract are impermeable to calcein and FITC-dextrans (both 40 and 500 kDa). I also show the formation of the first DIBs to be created using a total lipid extract from human cells as well as their impermeability to calcein. The extract tested was prepared from testicular Sertoli cells, which exhibit properties similar to the blood-brain barrier, but future work will focus on extracts prepared from human brain endothelial cells. Finally, I explore new options for the on-chip detection of the transport of nonfluorescent molecules. To move away from reliance on fluorescent molecules for permeability measurements, I selected three fluorogenic molecular recognition agents (fluorescamine, Chromeo P540, and DimerDye 4) whose fluorescence signal is activated by amine groups. None of the tested methods proved to be viable in DIBs, potentially due to slow permeation, low quantum yield, and side reactions with phospholipids. Overall, I demonstrate here the microfluidic formation and application of several novel types of biomimetic DIBs to permeability prediction. My work shows that DIBs can be used to predict permeability and mirror effects observed in vivo. Future work will focus on the development of new methods for the detection of drug transport and the application of the pharmacokinetic compartment models presented to predicting drug permeability. Further work using total lipid extracts prepared from human cells will also be vital to enhancing the use of biomimetic DIBs as pharmacokinetic permeability prediction tools. As their biological similarity and capacity to accurately predict transport increase, so will the potential of DIBs to improve the accuracy and translatablity of preclinical drug development. ; Graduate ; 2022-08-09},

abstract={In this work, the influence of anion-adsorption on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at platinum electrocatalysts is evaluated. By chemical modification of the electrolyte composition, polarization-losses for the ORR shall be reduced in order to enhance power-densities in high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs). This was studied systematically for the first time by substitution of hydroxyl groups in phosphoric acid by perfluorinated alkyl chains. Perfluoro-alkylated phosphonic- and phosphinic acids proved to be both electro-chemically and thermally stable enough to serve as potential HT-PEMFC electrolytes. Compared with H3PO4 (PA), these acids exhibit substantially weaker adsorption tendencies on the surface of a platinum-based electrocatalyst. Consequently, overpotentials for the ORR on a flat platinum surface are reduced by 75%. The number of hydroxyl groups within the acid molecules and the negative charge density of their corresponding anions were identified as the main descriptor for their adsorption behavior, whereas the length of the perfluorinated side chain did not affect the ORR kinetics negatively. The activation barrier for the ORR on a flat platinum surface was reduced by 40% by adding bis(pentafluoroethyl)-phosphinic acid (BPPA) to the host electrolyte instead of PA. Under the same experimental conditions, the charge transfer resistance for the ORR decreased by more than three orders of magnitude. Electro-catalytic activities for the ORR at Pt3Co/C- and Pt/C-electrocatalysts were found to be significantly higher in perfluorinated electrolytes than in PA. In the pres-ence of BPPA, an enhancement of 85% was achieved. After accelerated aging proce-dures, the electro-chemical active surface area (ECA) decreased significantly. However, electro-catalytic activities for the ORR were still three orders of magnitude higher compared with PA under the same experimental conditions. The ORR-selectivity at Pt3Co/C- and Pt/C was measured to be dependent on the nature of the adsorbed species. The rate of peroxide production was correlated with the steric demand of the anionic species, with larger anions yielding more hydrogen peroxide. A HT-PEMFC single cell setup was successfully operated with mixtures of PA and 20% perfluoroalkyl-substituted phosphonic acids. Compared to operation with PA as an electrolyte, the performance was enhanced significantly.},

abstract={This dissertation deals with the synthesis and characterization of ion conducting polymer electrolyte membranes based on semi-crystalline poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) functionalized with sulfonic acid groups. We have studied the impact of reaction conditions such as sulfonation temperature and duration, and the addition of inorganic filler particles on the properties of these membranes. The main objective of this work is to enhance the thermal and mechanical properties of the sulfonated PEEK (SPEEK) membranes, with the least possible compromise in the ionic conductivity. This gains importance in the context of fuel cells that use proton exchange membranes (PEM) as the electrolyte between the anode and the cathode. State-of-the art PEM fuel cells mostly use perfluoro-sulfonic acid (PFSA) membranes which perform better at temperatures below 80 °C and are susceptible to CO poisoning of the precious platinum-based catalysts. To overcome this problem, the operating temperature of the fuel cell has to be raised above 100 °C. As water is indispensable for the proton conduction in the PFSA membrane, such elevated temperatures above the boiling point of water seriously degrade the proton conduction and hence the overall performance of the fuel cell. These problems have imparted on the fuel cell community the need to develop low cost, non-fluorinated membranes that are less dependent on platinum group metal catalysts.Therefore, the major driving forces for the selection the hydrocarbon based PEEK polymer are its lower cost and relatively higher mechanical stability compared to standard PFSA-based polymers. On addition of hydrophilic inorganic fillers in the SPEEK polymer matrix, the thermal stability and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer are enhanced, which make these composite membranes highly favorable for applications in high-temperature PEM fuel cells. An iterative optimization process was followed to determine the conditions required to fabricate membranes with the desired properties, namely high proton conductivity, low swelling in water, and high thermo-mechanical stability. This optimization process involved a number of characterization techniques, such as proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy to determine the degree of sulfonation (DS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for measuring the thermal stability and Tg, respectively, and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) to study the mechanical properties.Structural changes in the polymer matrix were studied using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, while the localized segmental motion and the corresponding dielectric transitions were studied by broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS). Proton conductivity values of the prepared membranes measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were observed to increase linearly with DS. The threshold DS value above which the membrane loses its mechanical stability, resulting in excessive swelling in water was determined to be 80%, whichcorresponds to 0.8 sulfonic acid groups per repeat unit of the PEEK polymer.To enhance the mechanical stability, hydrophilic inorganic fillers such as AlPO4 and silica functionalized with sulfonic acid groups were incorporated in the polymer matrix. Among the composite membranes, the SPEEK composite with 7 wt.% silica (DS = 56%) exhibited the best thermo-mechanical stability and proton conductivity. Compared to standard Nafion membrane, this composite membrane was thermally more stable up to 207 °C with a storage modulus value one order of magnitude higher. The observed Tg values of the composite membranes were also higher than that of Nafion, indicating a promising aspect for application in high-temperature PEM fuel cells. The observed lower conductivity values of the SPEEK membranes compared to Nafion could be attributed to the difference in the inherent microstructures of these two polymers. This difference was probed using small-angly X-ray spectroscopy (SAXS) which revealed a weaker hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase separation and a larger center-to-center distance between ionic clusters in the SPEEK polymer matrix than in Nafion. Although the addition of inorganic fillers slightly increased the ionic cluster density, the relatively narrower water channels in SPEEK with higher tortuosity combined with a large number of dead-ends significantly hinder the proton transport.Membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) with the best performing membrane were fabricated by catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) process and fuel cell tests were performed using hydrogen as the fuel and pure oxygen as the oxidant.Hydrogen crossover, in-situ impedance and polarization characteristics were studied during the operation of the fuel cell. Thus, a systematic development and characterization process was followed for the optimization of the membranes and it was demonstrated that by optimizing the reaction conditions and filler loading, it is possible to fabricate novel, low cost proton exchange membranes for high-temperature fuel cell applications. ; status: published},

abstract={Membrane distillation (MD) is a promising technology to treat high salinity wastewater, but the high operational cost, lack of comprehensive understanding in its heat and mass transfer, and limited ability in treating various wastewater (e.g., low surface tension wastewater, volatile contaminants rich wastewater, etc.) have impeded its translation from bench scale to field scale. Nanophotonic-Enabled Solar Membrane Distillation (NESMD) utilizes free sunlight to produce localized heat on the membrane surface, which can make MD economically viable. However, the current membranes for NESMD exhibit either an increased mass transfer resistance to water vapor or a decreased photothermal properties after immobilized on the substrate membrane surface. Plus, unlike conventional MD whose performance dependency on the operational and environmental conditions are well understood, the operational and environmental effects on NESMD have not been fully understood. In addition, none of the existing NESMD membrane is anti-wetting, which limits its application only in dealing high surface tension wastewaters. Lastly, all current MD and NESMD membranes suffer from the problem of poor rejection against volatile contaminants (VC). In this dissertation, core-shell structure hydrophilic photothermal nanofiber is used to solve the tradeoff between membrane permeability and solar absorptivity. With good water stability, high solar absorbance, fast heating and heat dissipation abilities, and no additional vapor mass transfer resistance, it can be used as a coating material to convert a commercial membrane to a photothermal active membrane. Compared to existing solar MD coating materials, the novel core-shell structure coating shows a better solar MD performance. To understand the impact of operation and environmental factors on NESMD, the response of NESMD to the environmental (i.e., solar irradiance, and feed water temperature and salinity) and operating conditions (e.g., feed flowrate) were systematically investigated. The results show that NESMD perform better under higher solar irradiance and feed/permeate inlet temperature, and lower IR portion light source, feed salinity, and feed flowrate. To enable NESMD in treating low surface tension wastewater, a dual functional, omniphobic−photothermal nanocomposite membrane was developed to achieve wetting resistance and low energy consumption. The membrane was prepared by forming a hierarchical structure of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (FAS17) modified carbon black (CB) nanoparticles (NPs) on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane surface. The fluorinated CB NPs absorbed sun light to provide localized heating for NESMD, which increased membrane flux by 25% upon simulated solar irradiation at one sun unit. The utilization efficiency of solar energy in the NESMD process, 75.9%, is more than one order of magnitude higher than the energy efficiency of the conventional direct contact membrane distillation process. Furthermore, the re-entrant structure formed by the CB NPs together with the hydrophobic FAS17 coating led to low surface energy and hence omniphobicity, increasing the contact angle of the 80 vol% ethanol-in-water from 0 to 94.2°. As a result, the dual functional membrane exhibited much higher resistance to wetting by surfactants. Whereas the pristine PVDF membrane was wetted by 0.2 mM SDS, SDS had no effect on the dual function membrane over the whole SDS concentration range tested (0.1 – 0.4 mM). The photothermal activity, improved thermal efficiency, and strong wetting resistance make the dual functional omniphobic−photothermal membrane an excellent membrane material for the NESMD process. Lastly, to improve the VC rejection ability in MD, Graphene oxide (GO) based membranes were fabricated by sandwiching GO and ethylene diamine crosslinked GO (GO-EDA) between a commercial polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and electrospun PVDF nanofiber, and tested their volatile contaminant rejection under different feed temperature, feed pH, and durations by using NH3 as a model volatile contaminant. For the first time, a volatile-contaminants-rejective MD membrane was reported, and the rejection mechanism of NH3 by GO membrane was revealed. Compared to commercial MD membrane, under different experimental conditions, our GO-based membranes always show two orders of magnitude better NH3 rejection with only one third drop in water vapor mass transfer resistance. The NH3 rejection of GO membrane is as high as 97.8%, which is 2.7 times better than the state of art RO membrane. The high volatile contaminants rejection makes our GO membrane good candidates in treating volatile contaminants rich wastewater.},

abstract={Sample preparation is the most time-consuming and error-prone step in chemical analysis. Miniaturization and automation of the sample preparation equipment eliminating or reducing the use of hazardous organic solvents, online hyphenation of sample preparation with analytical instruments in a cost-effective way are important factors that need to be considered to design and implement innovative sample preparation techniques and strategies. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a simple, environmentally benign technique well suited for hyphenation with analytical instruments. However, poor coating stability is a significant drawback of SPME employing conventionally prepared coatings. This shortcoming arises from the lack of chemical bonding between the sorbent coating and the substrate. Introduction of sol-gel coatings in SPME greatly improved thermal stability and solvent stability in SPME, by providing direct chemical bonding between substrate and the sol-gel coating. In traditional fiber format of SPME (where the sorbent coating is placed on the outer surface of an end-segment of the fiber) the coating remains vulnerable to mechanical damage. Capillary microextraction (CME), the capillary format of SPME (also known as in-tube SPME), allows to overcome this shortcoming by securing the sorbent coating on inner walls of the capillary. This dissertation focuses on the development and systematic investigation of novel silica- and germania-based perfluorinated and non-fluorinated sol-gel sorbents in the form of CME surface coatings: their preparation, material characterization, CME performance evaluation, preconcentration and recovery of various analytes including environmental pollutants. This research established that germania-based sol-gel sorbents are characterized by superior microextraction performance than analogous silica-based sorbents. This enhanced performance provided by germania-based sol-gel sorbents may be explained based on thermogravimetric analysis suggests that higher carbon loading on germania-based sol-gel sorbents. Germania-based phenyl- (Ph), phenethyl- (PhE), octyl- (C8), octadecyl- (C18) and cyclohexenylethyl- (ChE) ligand-containing sol-gel sorbents were prepared and various pollutants with aromatic rings (such as aromatic ketones, aldehydes and polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons) were extracted and analyzed by CME-GC and CME-HPLC. It was observed that sol-gel sorbents containing aromatic ligands (PhE and Ph) provided superior microextraction performance for the analytes with aromatic ring(s) in their structure, than the sorbents with aliphatic ligands (C8 and C18). Investigation of sol-gel sorbents containing hydrophobic perfluorooctyl (PF-C8) and perfluorododecyl (PF-C12) ligands revealed that PF-C8 and PF-C12 sol-gel sorbents provided ~ 3 times higher microextraction efficiency (measure in terms of specific extraction, SE) than corresponding non-fluorinated counterparts, C8- and C12-, respectively. The synthesis and design of silica- and germania-based dual ligands sol-gel sorbents simultaneously providing superhydrophobicity and π-π interactions with analytes represent a significant accomplishment of this research. Such sorbents contained a PF-C12 and PhE ligands incorporated in sorbent chemical structure. In this case, perfluoro- group provided enhanced hydrophobic interaction and PhE group provided π-π interaction with the analytes. Combination of such interactions proved to be quite effective in the microextraction of alkylbenzenes and related compounds. Dual-ligand sol-gel sorbents with both equimolar and non-equimolar ligand concentrations were prepared. Experimentally it was established that sorbents with higher perfluorinated alkyl ligand concentrations had higher affinity for aliphatic hydrocarbons; however; when PhE concentration was higher, the dual-ligand sorbent showed enhanced affinity for aromatic compounds. The prepared sol-gel sorbents were characterized by less than 5% run-to-run RSD values, and also less than 5% capillary-to-capillary RSD values, which indicate that the sol-gel technique used in sorbent preparation was highly reproducible. The prepared sol-gel sorbents also showed that their performance does not deteriorate under aqueous saline matrix; therefore, it could be useful in the microextraction of pollutants from ocean water.},

abstract={Light and ultrasound are both non-ionizing radiations, ideal for biomedical applications. Recent studies on combining ultrasound and light for biomedical imaging show new promises in improving imaging quality and/or providing complementary imaging contrast. Among a variety of the imaging modalities that simultaneously use ultrasound and light, this work focuses on optical detection of tissue responses to acoustic radiation force (ARF). The applications include optical shear wave elastography and ultrasound modulated optical tomography. The first half of the thesis provides a systematic study on tracking shear waves in optical turbid media using CCD-based laser speckle contrast analysis. The theory, simulation and experiment are developed and cross-validated. The simulation quantitatively relates CCD speckle contrast signal with shear waves, providing useful information to understand the underlying physics. In addition, multiple shear waves are tracked using laser speckle contrast detection. Results show that two counter-propagating shear waves produce a modulation pattern in the optical signal, and the modulation pattern was suggested by simulation as a result of the dual shear wave interference. Shear wave speed measurements in phantoms suggest that the dual shear wave approach is more accurate than the single shear wave approach as that the standard deviation of the speed measurement is reduced by a factor of at least 2. The the dual shear wave approach also provides a reduced boundary effect. Both factors suggest that the dual shear wave approach should improve the accuracy of elasticity measurements. In the second half of the thesis, instead of detecting ARF response in the late phase, the study is motivated by detecting ARF response in the early stage for enhancement of ultrasound modulation of light. A pilot study on incorporating perfluorocarbon-based phase change contrast agent with ultrasound modulated optical tomography is explored. To understand the phase transition process, a quantitative measurement of acoustic nanodroplet vapourisation is developed. A preliminary result also showed that a single ultrasound burst can simultaneously vaporise the nanodroplets and sonify the converted microbubbles to provide additional ultrasound modulation of light. This additional light modulation was shown to increase the laser speckle contrast signal detected on a CCD camera. ; Open Access},

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a group of more than 4,700 anthropogenic chemicals that have been produced for over 70 years and used in a broad range of industrial applications and consumer products. Due to their adverse effects on human health and the environment, attention has been drawn to so-called “long-chain” PFASs as global contaminants since the late 1990s. Along with regulatory actions and voluntary industry initiatives to restrict the production, use and release of these chemicals, an industrial transition has taken place. This includes a geographical shift of production from countries in Europe and North America to countries in Asia and a transition to replacement chemicals, of which many are still PFASs. While regulated long-chain PFASs have been well investigated (“legacy PFASs”), potential adverse properties, environmental occurrence and fate of other PFASs are largely unknown (“emerging PFASs”). In addition, only a small amount of PFASs on the global market is monitored using conventional compound-specific analytical methods. This raises the question if the commonly analysed PFASs are representative or if they make up only a small fraction of anthropogenic PFAS releases. This thesis aimed at identifying which emerging PFASs are of relevance in the European coastal environment and at investigating their potential long-range transport to the Arctic. A comparison to legacy PFASs was to be made and knowledge gaps regarding the ultimate sinks of PFASs in the aquatic environment were intended to be filled. Moreover, it was the aim to characterize the unknown fraction of PFASs in German and Chinese river water impacted by industrial point sources. To achieve these aims, analytical methods for the selective and sensitive determination of 29 legacy and emerging PFASs in seawater, river water and sediment were developed and validated. The instrumental analysis was performed by means of liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Method detection limits were in the pg/L range for aqueous matrices and in the pg/g range for sediment. Hence, they were suitable for the analysis of samples from the marine environment. Samples were collected in coastal areas of the North and Baltic Seas, along a sampling transect from Europe to the Arctic and within Fram Strait, situated between Greenland and Svalbard. Additional samples were taken from German and Chinese rivers, up- and downstream of suspected point sources. Hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO-DA), an ether-based replacement compound for the legacy compound perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), was detected in 191 of the 202 analysed surface water samples. This finding adds to a growing body of literature indicating the ubiquitous presence of HFPO-DA. In addition, HFPO-DA was detected in Arctic surface water for the first time, providing evidence that the compound undergoes long-range transport to remote areas, similar to PFOA. In contrast to HFPO-DA, the occurrence of the other investigated emerging PFASs was limited to particular study areas, country-specific or source-specific. This included the cyclic compound perfluoro-4-ethylcyclohexanesulfonic acid (PFECHS), two perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acids (6:6 and 6:8 PFPiA), as well as the ether-based compounds 4,8-dioxa-3H-perfluorononanoic acid (DONA) and 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acid (6:2 Cl-PFESA). In coastal waters of the North Sea, a downward trend of legacy long-chain PFASs in combination with a shift to HFPO-DA as most prevalent compound was observed. This can be attributed to the phase-out and regulation of long-chain PFASs in Europe. In contrast, the analysis of Chinese river water indicated ongoing high emissions of the legacy compound PFOA in China from point sources in the Xiaoqing River Basin and along the Yangtze River, reflecting the geographical shift of production. Moreover, legacy long-chain compounds still played a major role in surface water from the European Baltic Sea and in sediments from both North and Baltic Seas. This points to ongoing emissions from diffuse sources and underlines the relevance of sediments as sink of legacy long-chain PFASs in the marine environment. Based on seven vertical PFAS profiles in Fram Strait (down to 3,117 m depth), PFAS mass flows entering the Arctic Ocean from the North Atlantic and exiting the Arctic in the opposite direction were estimated. The results indicate a net inflow of long-chain PFASs with ≥ 8 perfluorinated carbons and a net outflow of shorter-chain homologues. The PFAS composition profile provides a possible explanation for this, suggesting a higher contribution of atmospheric sources to outflowing water compared to inflowing water, in which oceanic transport plays a more important role. The higher retention of the long-chain compounds in melting snow and ice may serve as an additional explanation. In German and Chinese river water, 24 of 29 analysed PFASs were detected, with a sum ranging from 2.7 ng/L to 420,000 ng/L. As an upcoming analytical approach, the Total Oxidizable Precursor (TOP) assay was applied to estimate the sum of PFAS precursors in the samples that oxidize to targeted PFASs. Upon oxidative conversion, the sum of targeted PFASs significantly increased, indicating the presence of unknown precursors. To elucidate the composition of the unknown fraction, a high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based approach was applied. Screening the river water samples for the more than 4,700 known PFASs as “suspects”, 83 PFASs from 13 homologous series were identified. Of these, 13 have not been reported in the environment before. The results from the TOP assay and the suspect screening show that commonly analysed PFASs only represent a fraction of the PFASs present in the investigated German and Chinese river water. This indicates that environmental and human exposure to PFASs may be considerably underestimated. In addition, it underlines that further actions on PFASs require a grouping approach. If implemented on a regulatory level, this will also help to avoid regrettable substitution. Beyond the prioritization and assessment of replacements in use and the development of safe alternatives, the systematic differentiation between essential and non-essential uses of PFAS can be a way forward. In many consumer products, PFASs are not essential and raising public awareness of this issue can contribute to eliminate such applications as a starting point. ; Per- und polyfluorierte Alkylsubstanzen (PFASs) stellen eine Gruppe von mehr als 4.700 anthropogenen Chemikalien dar, die seit mehr als 70 Jahren produziert werden und in vielen industriellen Anwendungen und Konsumgütern ihren Einsatz finden. Sogenannte „langkettige“ PFASs stehen aufgrund ihrer nachteiligen Auswirkungen auf Mensch und Umwelt seit Ende der 1990er-Jahre als globale Umweltkontaminanten im Fokus. Einhergehend mit regulatorischen Maßnahmen und freiwilligen Herstellerinititativen zur Einschränkung der Produktion, Verwendung und Freisetzung dieser Substanzen fand ein industrieller Wandel statt. Einerseits wurde ein Teil der Produktion von europäischen und nordamerikanischen Ländern nach Asien verlagert und andererseits wird auf nicht regulierte Ersatzstoffe ausgewichen, die meist auch zur Stoffgruppe der PFASs gehören. Während regulierte langkettige PFASs gut untersucht sind („klassische PFASs“), sind potentiell schädliche Eigenschaften, das Umweltvorkommen und der Verbleib anderer PFASs größtenteils unbekannt („neuartige PFASs“). Darüber hinaus decken konventionelle analytische Methoden nur eine geringe Anzahl der PFASs auf dem Weltmarkt ab. Daher stellt sich die Frage, ob die üblicherweise analysierten Substanzen repräsentativ sind oder nur einen geringen Anteil der freigesetzten PFASs ausmachen. Ziel dieser Doktorarbeit war es, die Relevanz von neuartigen PFASs in europäischen Küstengewässern und ihren möglichen Langstreckentransport in die Arktis zu untersuchen. Es sollte ein Vergleich zu Vorkommen, Verteilung und Verbleib klassischer PFASs gezogen werden und Wissenslücken in Hinblick auf Senken der Substanzen in der aquatischen Umwelt geschlossen werden. Darüber hinaus sollte anhand von deutschen und chinesischen Flusswasserproben, die durch potentielle Punktquellen beeinflusst waren, der unbekannte Anteil an PFASs näher charakterisiert werden. Hierzu wurde zunächst eine analytische Methode für die selektive und sensitive Bestimmung von 29 PFASs in Meerwasser, Flusswasser und Sedimenten entwickelt und validiert. Die Messung erfolgte mittels Flüssigchromatographie mit Tandem-Massenspektrometrie-Kopplung (LC-MS/MS). Die Nachweisgrenzen der Methode lagen im pg/L-Bereich für Wasser und im pg/g-Bereich für Sedimente und waren somit für die Analytik von Proben aus der marinen Umwelt geeignet. Proben wurden in küstennahen Gebieten der Nord- und Ostsee, entlang einer Transekte von der Nordsee in den Arktischen Ozean sowie in der Framstraße zwischen Grönland und Spitzbergen gesammelt. Darüber hinaus erfolgten Probenahmen flussauf- und flussabwärts von potentiellen Punktquellen in Deutschland und China. Hexafluorpropylenoxid-Dimersäure (HFPO-DA), ein Ersatzstoff für die regulierte Substanz Perfluoroctansäure (PFOA), wurde in 191 der 202 untersuchten Oberflächenwasserproben nachgewiesen. Dieses Ergebnis untermauert eine zunehmende Anzahl an Veröffentlichungen, die auf ein ubiquitäres Vorkommen von HFPO-DA hinweisen. Darüber hinaus wurde die Substanz in dieser Arbeit erstmals in arktischem Oberflächenwasser nachgewiesen. Das liefert einen empirischen Beweis dafür, dass HFPO-DA wie seine Vorgängersubstanz PFOA über weite Strecken in entlegene Gebiete transportiert werden kann. Im Gegensatz zu HFPO-DA war das Vorkommen anderer untersuchter neuartiger PFASs auf bestimmte Untersuchungsgebiete beschränkt, länder- oder quellenspezifisch. Dies schloss die cyclische Substanz Perfluor-4-ethylcyclohexansulfonsäure (PFECHS), zwei perfluorierte Phosphinsäuren (6:6 und 6:8 PFPiA), die Polyfluoralkylethercarbonsäure 4,8-Dioxa-3H-Perfluornonansäure (DONA) und eine chlorierte Polyfluoralkylethersulfonsäure (6:2 Cl-PFESA) ein. In Küstengewässern der Nordsee stellte HFPO-DA die dominierende PFAS-Komponente dar, wohingegen die Konzentrationen der klassischen PFASs im Vergleich zu früheren Messungen zurückgingen. Das spiegelt den industriellen Trend von den klassischen PFASs hin zu Ersatzstoffen wider. Im Gegensatz dazu zeigten die Analysenergebnisse der chinesischen Flusswasserproben, dass die Emissionen der klassischen Substanz PFOA in China durch Punktquellen im Einzugsgebiet der Flüsse Xiaoqing und Yangtze anhaltend hoch sind. Es ist davon auszugehen, dass das im Zusammenhang mit der Produktionsverlagerung nach China steht. Darüber hinaus waren klassische PFASs dominierende Substanzen in Oberflächenwasserproben der Ostsee und in Sedimenten der Nord- und Ostsee. Das deutet auf anhaltende Emissionen aus diffusen Quellen hin und stellt die Rolle mariner Sedimente als Senke für langkettige PFASs heraus. Auf Basis von sieben Tiefenprofilen in der Framstraße, bis in eine Tiefe von 3.117 m, wurde die Menge an PFASs abgeschätzt, die jährlich über Wassermassen vom Nordatlantik in den Arktischen Ozean hineintransportiert wird und entgegengesetzt die Arktis verlässt. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass langkettige PFASs mit ≥8 perfluorierten Kohlenstoffatomen in der Summe in die Arktis hineintransportiert werden, wohingegen kürzerkettige Substanzen die Arktis verlassen. Das Verteilungsmuster der PFASs lässt darauf schließen, dass im austretenden Wasser ein größerer Anteil der PFASs aus atmosphärischen Quellen stammt als im eintretenden Wasser, in dem der Transport mit den Meeresströmungen eine größere Rolle spielt. Darüber hinaus kann die höhere Anreicherung langkettiger Verbindungen in Schnee und Eis einen Einfluss haben. In deutschen und chinesischen Flusswasserproben wurden 24 der 29 untersuchten PFASs nachgewiesen, wobei die Summe der PFASs zwischen 2,7 ng/L und 420,000 ng/L lag. Als neuer summarischer Ansatz wurde der Total Oxidizable Precursor-Assay (TOP)-Assay angewandt, um auf die Menge an unbekannten Vorläuferverbindungen in den Proben zu schließen, die zu den in der Messmethode enthaltenden stabilen Endprodukten oxidiert werden können. In den oxidierten Proben war die Summe der analysierten PFASs signifikant höher als in den nicht oxidierten Proben, was auf unbekannte Vorläufersubstanzen hindeutet. Um die Zusammensetzung des unbekannten Anteils näher zu charakterisieren, wurde hochauflösende Massenspektrometrie (HRMS) eingesetzt. Durch ein Screening der Flusswasserproben auf mehr als 4.700 bekannte PFASs als sogenannte „Suspects“ wurden 83 PFASs aus 13 homologen Serien identifiziert. Davon wurden 13 Substanzen vorher noch nicht in der Umwelt beschrieben. Die Ergebnisse des TOP-Assays und des Suspect-Screenings zeigen, dass die üblicherweise analysierten PFASs nur einen Teil der PFASs in den untersuchten deutschen und chinesischen Flüssen abdecken. Das deutet darauf hin, dass die Exposition von Mensch und Umwelt mit PFASs deutlich unterschätzt wird. Zudem zeigt es die Wichtigkeit, PFASs nicht einzeln, sondern als Substanzgruppe zu betrachten. Ein solcher Ansatz auf regulatorischer Ebene könnte dazu beitragen, bedauerliche Substitutionsentscheidungen zu vermeiden. Darüber hinaus könnte neben der Priorisierung und der Beurteilung von bereits verwendeten Ersatzstoffen und der Entwicklung von sicheren Alternativstoffen vor allem eine systematische Unterscheidung von essentiellen und nicht-essentiellen Anwendungen von PFASs einen Weg nach vorne bedeuten. In vielen Konsumgütern sind PFASs nicht unerlässlich und die öffentliche Sensibilisierung hierfür könnte dazu beitragen, in einem ersten Schritt solche Anwendungen zu unterbinden.},

abstract={The importance of batteries to sustainable energy is widely recognized. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) not only power handheld electronics but also are increasingly being implemented in electric vehicles and “smart-grid” applications to store energy from intermittent solar and wind sources, making sustainable energy a reality. Unfortunately, LIBs contain a highly flammable solvent and can exhibit catastrophic failure, as was brought to the public’s attention by the Boeing 787, Samsung Galaxy Note 7, hoverboard, and Tesla battery fires. Thus, realizing the full potential of LIBs in large-scale systems requires the development of nonflammable electrolytes. Perfluoropolyether (PFPE)-based electrolytes address many of the shortcomings of conventional carbonate-based electrolytes or polymer electrolytes such as poly(ethylene oxide). PFPE-based electrolytes transport lithium more efficiently than conventional electrolytes, which has important implications on long-term battery performance. PFPEs make interesting electrolyte solvents because they are nonflammable, nonvolatile, liquid across a broad temperature range, chemically stable, and interact favorably with the anion of fluorinated salts. In this work, the molecular underpinnings for ion transport in PFPE electrolytes will be established by systematically probing how PFPE structure affects electrolyte performance including ionic conductivity, diffusivity, and transference number. End group polarity, end group concentration, and PFPE molecular weight all have important implications on electrolyte performance. ; Doctor of Philosophy},

abstract={Abstract ; Different aspects of electron dynamics on surfaces, at metal-organic interfaces as well as in quasi-isolated monolayers of a molecular organic semiconductor are investigated using time- and angle-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy (2PPE). The Rydberg series of image-potential states and resonances have been studied by 2PPE in combination with quantum-beat spectroscopy up to quantum numbers of n=7 for the Ag(100) and Ag(111) surfaces, respectively. The lifetimes of the excited electrons follow a scaling law propotional to the third power of the quantum number for both, the image- otential states and the resonances. The decay of the resonances due to the resonant elastic electron transfer is found to be approximately one order of magnitude faster. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate, that for image-potential states as well as resonances the pure dephasing times of the coherently excited electron wave packets are independent from decay due to quasi-elastic scattering events with phonons. In addition, the interband scattering between different image-potential states due to electron-electron-scattering could be quantified for Ag(111). The extracted scattering rates confirm theoretical predictions. In order to obtain information about the influence of the interfacial interaction between organic molecular semiconductors and a metal surface on the binding energy and the wave function overlap of unoccupied Shockley-type metal-organic interface states, different model systems of metal-organic interfaces have been studied using 2PPE. The interfaces between monolayer films of the organic semiconductors 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic-acid-dianhydride (PTCDA) and 1,4,5,8-naphthalene-tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (NTCDA) and a Ag(111) surface have been systematically studied and the experimental results are compared to density functional theory calculations. The results reveal that the energy shift of the former Shockley-surface state is mainly influenced by the adsorption height between the molecular monolayer and the metal substrate as well as the density of carbon rings per unit cell area. In contrast, the overlap between the interface state and the electronic states of the molecules is determined to a large extent by the bending of the molecules and the bonding between the carboxylic oxygen atoms and the surface. Electrons that have been excited into the interface states decay back to metallic states predominantly due to electron-hole pair excitation. A reversible temperature dependent structural phase transition is characterized for perfluoropentacene (PFP) using 2PPE, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). When the sample temperature rises above T=145 K, the long-range ordered commensurate (6x3)-superstructure transforms into a disordered monolayer consisting of mobile molecules. In addition, the influence of the organic adlayer on the properties of image-potential states is studied for PFP/Ag(111) and compared to similar model systems in order to extract general trends. The binding energies of the Rydberg series of image-potentials states can be described without the use of a quantum defect. The local workfunction of the PFP-covered surface areas has been determined with high precision by the convergence of the Rydberg series for high quantum numbers. Apparently, the decay channel via the unoccupied interface state leads to a decrease of the inelastic lifetimes of the excited electrons in image-potential states while the lifetime of electrons in image-potential resonances increases due to the decoupling of the resonances from the substrate by the molecular layer. The investigation of quasi-isolated PTCDA-monolayer films adsorbed KCl/Ag(100) with 2PPE shows that the intramolecular electron dynamics can be studied using photoelectron spectroscopy techniques even when the molecular layer has been decoupled from the conducting substrate by an insulating thin film. The obtained data can be explained consistently with the assumption of an exciton in the PTCDA molecules with a high binding energy (E=-1.7 eV). Highly excited PTCDA-molecules rapidly relax towards the strongest bound exciton with time constants of $tau lesssim 300$~fs. An excitation that is observed in the 2PPE-spectra shows an inelastic lifetime in the range of a few nanoseconds. Together with the UV-excitation induced quenching of the luminescence from the PTCDA monolayer the observation can be explained by the formation of a stabilized charge-transfer exciton. ; Abstract ; In der vorliegenden Dissertation werden verschiedene Aspekte der Elektronendynamik an Metalloberflächen, in metall-organischen Grenzflächenzuständen und in quasi-isolierten PTCDA-Monolagen mittels zeit- und winkelaufgelöster Zweiphotonen-Photoemission (2PPE) untersucht. Die Rydberg-Serien von Ag(100)-Bildpotentialzuständen und Ag(111)-Bildpotentialresonanzen werden mit einer Kombination von 2PPE und Quantenschwebungsspektroskopie jeweils bis zu einer Quantenzahl von n=7 vermessen und eine Skalierung der Lebensdauer proportional zur dritten Potenz der Quantenzahl n gefunden. Die Lebensdauern der Resonanzen sind aufgrund des resonanten elastischen Transfers von Elektronen in die Festkörperbänder gegenüber den Bildpotentialzuständen um etwa eine Größenordnung verkürzt. Die experimentellen Resultate deuten weiter darauf hin, dass die reinen Dephasierungszeiten der kohärent angeregten Elektronen weder in Bildpotentialzuständen noch in -resonanzen durch die quasi-elastische Streuung mit Phononen beeinflusst werden. Außerdem kann der Beitrag der Elektron-Elektron-Streuung zum Interbandzerfall zwischen Bildpotentialzuständen auf der Ag(111)-Oberfläche identifiziert und durch eine Abschätzung der Streuraten theoretische Vorhersagen für diesen Zerfallskanal bestätigt werden. Die Einfluss der Wechselwirkungen zwischen organischen Halbleitern und einer Metalloberfläche auf die energetische Position und die Wellenfunktion der unbesetzten Shockley-artigen Grenzflächenzustände wird in einer systematischen Untersuchung der Grenzflächen zwischen Monolagen der Moleküle Perylen-3,4,9,10-TetraCarbonsäure-DiAnhydrid (PTCDA) und Naphtalen-1,4,5,8-TetraCarbonsäure-DiAnhydrid (NTCDA) und dem Ag(111)-Substrat mittels 2PPE untersucht. Die Resultate werden mit Ergebnissen aus Dichtefunktionaltheorie-Rechnungen verglichen. Der Vergleich der unterschiedlichen Modellsysteme zeigt, dass die energetische Verschiebung des Shockley-Zustands fast ausschließlich von der Adsorptionshöhe der Moleküle, also der Distanz zwischen Molekül und Oberfläche sowie der Oberflächendichte der Kohlenstoffringe abhängt. Der Überlapp des Grenzflächenzustands mit den elektronischen Zuständen der Moleküle wird größtenteils von der Verbiegung der Moleküle und der Ausbildung der gerichteten Bindung zwischen den Sauerstoffatomen der Carboxylgruppe und der Oberfläche beeinflusst. Elektronen, die in die Grenzflächenzustände angeregt wurden, relaxieren größtenteils durch Elektron-Loch-Paaranregung zurück in die Metallzustände. Ein reversibler temperaturabhängiger struktureller Phasenübergang einer PerFluoro-Pentacen-Monolage (PFP) auf Ag(111) wird mittels 2PPE, Nahkanten-Röntgenabsorptionsspektroskopie (NEXAFS) und Beugung niederenergetischer Elektronen (LEED) charakterisiert. Die geordnete kristalline Phase mit einer zum Substrat kommensuraten (6x3)-Überstruktur geht bei Temperaturen oberhalb von T=145 K in eine ungeordnete Phase aus parallel zur Oberfläche frei beweglichen Molekülen über. Anhand des PFP/Ag(111)-Modellsystems wird zudem der Einfluss von organischen Adsorbatschichten auf Bildpotentialzustände untersucht und im Vergleich mit weiteren Modellsystemen werden die grundlegenden Tendenzen herausgearbeitet. Die Bindungsenergien der Rydberg-Serie können mit verschwindendem Quantendefekt beschrieben und die lokale Austrittsarbeit der PFP-bedeckten Bereiche über die Konvergenz der Bildpotentialzustände mit hoher Genauigkeit bestimmt werden. Der Zerfallskanal über den unbesetzten Grenzflächenzustand verkürzt offenbar die inelastische Lebensdauer der in die Bildpotentialzustände angeregten Elektronen, während der resonante elastische Elektronentransfer aus den Bildpotentialresonanzen aufgrund der Entkopplung durch die Molekülschicht an Effektivität verliert und deren Lebensdauer mit der Adsorbatbedeckung zunimmt. Die 2PPE-Experimente an quasi-isolierten PTCDA-Monolagen auf KCl/Ag(100) zeigen, dass die Untersuchung der intramolekularen Dynamik auch nach Entkopplung der Molekülschichten vom metallischen Substrat durch isolierende Zwischenschichten mittels Photoelektronenspektroskopie möglich ist. Die experimentellen Resultate der intramolekularen Anregungen können mit Hilfe einer hohen Bindungsenergie der exzitonischen Anregung in den PTCDA-Molekülen (E=-1.7 eV) konsistent erklärt werden. Die exzitonischen Anregungen in den PTCDA-Moleküle relaxieren mit Zeitkonstanten kleiner 300 fs in das am stärksten gebundene Exziton. Eine Anregung mit einer Lebensdauer im Bereich von Nanosekunden, die in den 2PPE-Spektren beobachtet wird, und die mit der UV-Anregungen verbundene Abschwächung der Lumineszenz der PTCDA-Monolage werden zusammen mit der Ausbildung eines stabilisierten Ladungstransfer-Exzitons erklärt.},

abstract={Durable and transparent anti-smudge coatings that repel both water- and oil-borne contaminants have many potential applications. Perfluorinated moieties were commonly used in the past to prepare water- and oil-repellant coatings, however these species are expensive and of significant environmental concern. Further, organic solvents have been traditionally used to formulate such coatings, however such solvent-based coating formulations emit volatile organic compounds and are a safety hazard. First reported in this thesis is the development of transparent and durable water-borne anti-smudge polyurethane coatings. These coatings are obtained by casting micellar solutions of a blocked polyisocyanate dispersed in water using a graft copolymer, polyol-g-PDMS, where the polyol backbone is water soluble and PDMS denotes poly(dimethyl siloxane). On these coatings, small 5-µL droplets of various liquids such as cooking and engine oils have no problem to glide cleanly off at substrate tilting angles < 5 °. Artificial fingerprint liquids, inks, and paints readily shrink into tiny droplets after application on them and their residues after solvent evaporation are readily wiped off with a tissue. Such waterborne coating formulations were also used to coat textile fibers, where they imparted superhydrophobic properties to the textiles. For both systems, the challenges associated with switching from a solvent-based to a water-based formulation for the targeted coatings will be discussed. The greenness of the coating formation process will also be highlighted for its practical value. In the future work, poorer water sliding behavior of NP-GLIDE coating (coatings bear nano-pools of grafted lubricating ingredient for dewetting enablement) will be improved with in-situ formation of free photo-cleavage PDMS chains. Also, the effect of chain length of PDMS to anti-smudge properties will be systematically investigated. Further, the robustness of these coatings will be tested. ; PhD},

abstract={Multi-component organic molecular films have seen increasing applications in photovoltaic technologies and other organic electronic applications. These applications have been based upon assumptions regarding film structure and electronic properties. This thesis provides an increased understanding of factors that control structure in binary molecular films and begins to establish structure-electronic property relations. In this thesis, three technologically relevant "donor-acceptor" systems are studied with variable temperature STM/STS: pentacene (Pn):C60, zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc): C60 and ZnPc: perfluorinated zinc phthalocyanine (F16ZnPc). These three model systems provide a systematic exploration of the impact of molecular shape and molecular band offset on morphology-electronic relations in thin film heterostructures. For Pn:C60, I show how domain size and architecture are controlled by composition and film processing conditions. Sequential deposition of pentacene, followed by C60, yields films that range from nanophase-separated, to co-crystalline phases, to a templated structure. These distinct structures are selectively produced from distinct pentacene phases which are controlled via pentacene coverage. For the ZnPc:C60 system, the shape of ZnPc and the lattice mismatch between ZnPc and C60 are quite different from the Pn:C60 films. Nonetheless, ZnPc:C60 films also yield chemical morphologies that can be similarly controlled from phase separated, to co-crystalline phases, to templated structures. In both of these binary films, I exploit relative differences in the component cohesive energies to control phase selection. In bilayer films of both systems, a common structural element of stress-induced defects is also observed. In ZnPc:F16ZnPc, I explore two components with similar shapes and cohesive energies while retaining molecular band offsets comparable to Pn:C60. In this shape-matched system, a checkerboard ZnPc:F16ZnPc arrangement stabilized by hydrogen bonds readily forms. This supramolecular structure introduces a new hybridization state close to the Fermi Level, yielding electronic properties distinct from the component phases. Through investigations of these three model systems, I have developed an understanding the control of chemical morphology along the donor-acceptor interface and the way this morphology influences electronic transport.},

abstract={Doctor ; Polymeric memory devices have attracted a great amount of attention due to their low fabrication cost, good scalability, and simplicity of device structure Therefore, functional polymers have been considered as alternatives to traditional inorganic semiconductor materials for memory devices because they can be easily miniaturized indevice fabrication and their properties can easily be tailored through chemical synthesis. These merits have further accelerated the development of several types of polymer-based memory devices such as rewritable memory, write-once read-many times (WORM) memory, and dynamic random access memory (DRAM). However, none of reported studies can comprehensively account for the observed swiching properties of polymer memory, even though many operating mechanisms have benn proposed such as filamentary conduction, charge transfer, charge trapping and conformational chnge mechasinm. To figure out the operating mechanism of polymer memory device, the design of novel polymeric materials with controlled morphologies and electrical properties is required to elucidate the switching mechasnism because electrical behaviors is closely related to morphologies formed in thin films. First, different volume fraction of diblock copolymer is synthesized because block copolymers (BCP) can self-assemble into various ordered nanostructures (such as lamellae, cylinders, spheres and so on) with length scales ranging from 10 to 100 nm due to the repulsion between the chemically connected blocks. Secondly, correlation between memory and structure is studied by controlled morphologies and electrical properties. Lastly, development of a new polymeric materials system is needed for comprehensive understading, so various fluorinated brush polymers is synthesized and studied. In Chapter II, two series of crystalline-amorphous brush diblock copolymers bearing electroactive moieties were newly synthesized by sequential anionic ring-opening copolymerizations of glycidyl derivatives and subsequent selective post-functionalizations. Self-assembly structural details and electrical memory behaviors of these polymers in nanoscale thin films were investigated. The diblock copolymers revealed complex hierarchical self-assembly structures depending on the compositions. The self-assembly structure and orientation of the crystalline block chains were severely affected by the geometrical confinement (i.e., size and shape) resulted from phase-separation. Such film morphologies were found to cause significant influences on the electrical properties; they exhibited electrical properties from p-type permanent memory behavior to dielectric-like behavior. The permanent memory performances were further varied with the morphology parameters. The observed digital memory behaviors were originated from the electroactive moieties incorporated into the bristle ends. In Chapter III, perfluorinated and carbazole brush-containing block copolymer series, poly(3-((6-((7-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)heptanoyl)oxy)hexyl) thio)propyl glycidyl ether - b - glycidyl 12-((3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9, 9,10,10,10-heptadecafluorodecyl) oxy)-12-oxo dodecanoate) (PGCHHSP20-b-PGHFD60), (PGCHHSP40-b-PGHFD40), (PGCHHSP60-b-PGHFD20), were synthesized. The polymer was thermally stable up to 300 oC. Below the degradation temperature, it showed a glass transition, crystal melting transition, and a liquid crystal to isotropic melt transition. Most of the materials developed so far are only partially fluorinated materials with relatively low fluorine contents. Highly fluorinated polymers such as Teflon are difficult to process into high-quality films, thereby restricting their applicability. As a consequence, the innovative development of new types of highly fluorinated polymers with easy processability has become very attractive. Therefore, we demonstrates that well-defined linear homo polymer and diblock copolymers with the AGE and EEGE monomer, which are versatile and selectively functionalizable polyether platforms is used to synthesize polymer containing liquid crystalline and amorphous block for a variety of nanostructures and memory device applications. Most of all, synthesiezed brush diblock copolymer with different volume fraction is used to study relationship between memory and structure by controlled morphologies and electrical properties. In Chapter IV, fluorinated side chain liquid crystal polymers have been prepared and properties of synthesized polymers were studied. We report fluorinated polymers composed of hydrocarbon unit and semifluorinated side chain segments, where the number of fluorinated tails varies from one to eight. The polymeric structures described differed by the length of the perfluorinated chains and the spacer which joined the polymer backbone. The fluorinated brush polymers possessing different length of fluoroalkyl side group is used to study the correlation between the surface properties and liquid crystalline properties. By systematically probing the effect of structure on the surface organization of the fluorocarbon side chain, study of these brush polymers has helped optimize the semifluorinated side groups for creating low surface energy materials. In addition, electrical switching behaviors of fluorinated brush polymers are measured for memory device application, since research of electrical property with polymers bearing fluorine or fluuorocaron have not been reported except PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) and its copolymer. In Chapter V, we have prepared several polymers with mesogenic cores, coded PGBFn (PG : PolyGlycidyl-backbone, B : biphenyl-mesogenic core, Fn : the number of fluorocarbon-side chian). We designed the two types of polymer series with para-position and meta-position of biphenyl side group to study similarity and difference of crystalline structure and physical properties. The introduction of a mesogenic core will contributes to the stabilization and organization of fluorinated tails at the surface. The surface properties with contact angle measuremtn and surface energy is studied and all measured fluorinated brush polymer show the very low surface energy. This study will help us in the design of future liquid crystal polymers and low surface energy polymers opening an interesting field for the building of stable active surfaces with a favorable eco-toxic approach. In addition, quantitative studies on electrical properties of fluorinated polymer have not been carried out so far, electrical memory performance is measured with polymers which have the number of fluorinated tails varies from one to eight. In Chapter VI, we have synthesized a series of polymers bearing fluorinated aromatic ring side chains to investigate the effect of fluorine and trifluoromethyl group on the morphology, the crystal orientation, charge-carrier transport, and device performance. We have prepared several polymers with mesogenic cores and fluorinated aromatic ring, coded PGBaFbcCF3dP (PG : PolyGlycidyl-backbone, B : Biphenyl-mesogenic core, aFbcCF3dP : the number(a, c) and position(b, d) of fluorine or trifluoromethyl group on phenyl unit –fluorinated aromatic ring pendent). The fluorine atom has the highest Pauling electronegativity of 4.0 among electron-withdrawing groups and the electron density distribution of aromatic ring will be varied according to the position and the number of fluorine and trifluoromethyl group. This means the position of fluorine has significant effect on the crystalline behavior and thermal property.},

In the case of the systems (1) - (3), the aim was to analyse the extent of the dynamic disorder in the CF3 groups that are contained in these systems. To this end, segmented rigid body analysis has been employed to estimate forces constants and barriers to rotation of the relevant groups. Complimentary computational methods have been used to obtain further estimates of this barrier to rotation in these systems for both the isolated (gas phase) molecules and for the condensed matter phases for compounds (1) and (3).For Zinc Pyromellitate, variable temperature single crystal X-ray and neutron analysis have been used to probe the behaviour of a proton that sits in a short, strong intramolecular hydrogen bond. The aim here was to discover whether the system exhibits proton migration along the hydrogen bond as a function of temperature and thus gain insights into the energy potential well in which the proton sits. To this end, both computational methods have been used to study the pyromellitate fragment, and variable temperature full crystal structure data so as to gain direct access to information regarding this potential well.},

abstract={Batoids (Chondrichthyes: Batoidea; e.g. stingrays, skates, and guitarfish) comprise more than 55% of elasmobranch taxa and represent ecologically important predators in benthic and pelagic habitats. Although overexploitation and habitat degradation are the two biggest threats to batoid populations, coastal and oceanic pollution is also a pervasive potential threat. In this systematic review, we compile published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea superorder and present contamination patterns, expos re effects, and potential human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found batoids to accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Accumulation of POPs is reported for chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Hg levels in muscle tissue were significantly different among oceanic basins and habitats, consistent with previous global assessments of Hg oceanic background levels. Some batoid species presented Hg levels higher than large pelagic teleost fishes and comparable to sharks. Ecological traits such as, bottom feeding, upper trophic position and elasmobranch-specific physiology and metabolism are discussed as potential factors associated with Hg uptake and accumulation in batoids. Some species exceeded USEPA’s maximum contamination safety limits in edible tissues for Hg, As and ΣPCBs. For most trace metals and POPs, there is a lack of studies focusing on contamination levels in batoids. We recommend future research increasing reporting on POPs and trace metals besides Hg in batoids to further investigate the role of Elasmobranch as a bioindicator for marine pollution. ; San Diego State University},

Such a high temporal resolution allowed us to observe for the first time the bubble expansion mechanism that atomizes the jet. To visualize the dynamics in detail, I focused closely to the outflow of the nozzle using a long distance microscope objective. I documented an abrupt transition from a laminar to a fully external flashing jet by systematically reducing the ambient pressure. I performed experiments with different volatile liquids and using nozzles with different inner diameters. The inner diameters of the nozzles varied from 30 to 480 µm. Perfluorohexane (PFnH) was our main working fluid, but also methanol, ethanol and 1-bromopropane were tested. Surprisingly, minimum intensity profiles revealed spray angles close to θs ~360°, meaning drops are ejected in all directions. Also, I measured speeds of bubble expansion up to 140 m/s. That is 45 times faster than the upper bound for inertial growth speed in complete vacuum from the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. I also calculated the trajectories of the ejected droplets as well as the drop speed distribution using particle tracking. I expect that our results bring new insight into the flash-boiling atomization mechanism.},

abstract={在過去數十年間，聚亞醯胺(Polyimide,PI)已是一種廣泛被使用的高分子材料且擁有良好的熱性質、化學性質與機械強度。這些優點讓聚亞醯胺在過去的時間內都被當作是高效能之高分子應用材料的良好選擇。為了特定的應用需求，含氟聚亞醯胺也被開發研究，並被證實擁有許多一般聚亞醯胺沒有的優點。同時含氟聚亞醯胺也因為在有機溶劑中有好的可溶性，是製程簡化與加工處理的好選擇。而在最近幾年，聚亞醯胺塗膜根據需求，又更被進一步地開發出許多新的應用，包括防腐蝕、生醫材料等等一些新穎的用途。在這份博士論文中，含氟聚亞醯胺薄膜可經由不同的處理，包括奈米粒子表面噴塗與以單體置換方式形成共聚高分子，我們將其製備成不同特性之聚亞醯胺薄膜，分別應用在抗腐蝕與生醫材料等不同用途上。 在博士論文第一個部分，我們將矽氧甲基封端的氟化之二氧化矽奈米粒子噴塗在聚亞醯胺表面，來調整聚亞醯胺的表面形貌及化學特性，使其成為抗腐蝕且超疏水的聚亞醯胺複合材料。根據分析，矽氧甲基封端的氟化之二氧化矽奈米粒子噴塗大幅提升材料表面粗糙度，並使表面佈滿疏水的CF2官能基，因此能達到超疏水的效果。而這層噴塗也使這複合材料擁有較低的腐蝕電流密度、高腐蝕電位及腐蝕阻抗，在在顯示其擁有良好的抗腐蝕特性。經由矽氧甲基封端的氟化之二氧化矽奈米粒子噴塗，不但讓聚亞醯胺擁有超疏水的特性，並可隔絕造成腐蝕的因子到達金屬表面，進而提升聚亞醯胺塗附之金屬的抗腐蝕能力。這項技術不單能提供聚亞醯胺鍍附之金屬材料好的抗腐蝕能力，並且也能運用在其他高分子鍍膜材料上。 在第二個部分，我們將含氟聚亞醯胺的單體部分置換成親水的單體Jeffamine，控制其置換比例是10、20及30%，來置備出新型共聚亞醯胺薄膜(6FPI-Jx，x=10、20和30%)。在過去，雖然含氟聚亞醯胺被認為有在生物醫學領域上應用的潛力，但是其潛在的細胞毒性是應用上最大的問題。在這篇論文中，親水的胺基封端之聚醚分子Jeffamine被作為共聚亞醯胺的單體被摻入。經過適當的製程控制，此共聚亞醯胺如同一般聚亞醯胺，具有好的機械性質與穩定性。根據分析，將部分單體置換Jeffamine使得含氟聚亞醯胺的細胞毒性降低，並大幅提升其生物相容性與血液相容性，我們相信這樣的提升是來自於Jeffamine的加入，產生了材料表面結構與化學組成的變化所致。另外，共聚亞醯胺的可溶性也獲得保留，在此研究中我們也展示了此共聚亞醯胺能在金屬基材上行成均勻的鍍膜，我們相信此種新型共聚亞醯胺是成為人體植入物外層鍍膜的良好選擇，並且也預見這在未來治療的應用上有良好的潛力。 ; During the past several decades, Polyimide (PI) is already a widely used polymer in industries and exhibiting good thermal, chemical, and mechanical properties. These merits render PI a perfect candidate in high-performance engineering applications. To fit for specific purpose, fluoro-containing PI is developed and possesses additional advantages over common PI. Fluoro-containing PI is also soluble in many kinds of organic solvent, rendering a option for simplified operation and better processability. Till recently, new applications of PI coatings have been further investigated, including anti-corrosion and biomedical uses. In this dissertation, high performance fluoro-containing PI films were prepared through different modification process, such as spray-coating of modified nanoparticles and copolyimidization through monomer substitution. The application of modified PI films in anti-corrosion and biomedical uses were deeply explored in this research. In the first section of this dissertation, we prepared superhydrophobic PI hybrid coatings for anticorrosion application by adjusting their surface roughness and surface composition through spray-coating with silylated perfluoroalkylsilane-modified organosilicasol (silylated fluoro-organosilicasol), which increased the surface hydrophobicity. After silylation with 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), the silylated fluoro-organosilicasol further transformed the PI surface into a superhydrophobic state. According to the analyses, it suggests that both surface roughness and silylation of the fluoro-organosilicasol making more CF2 groups on the outmost surface rendered the surface hydrophobicity. These PI hybrid coatings also demonstrated good anti-corrosion performance such as lower corrosion current density, nobler corrosion potential and higher polarization resistance. The enhancement in anticorrosion performance was believed to be contributed from the superhydrophobicity and dual barrier protection from the fully-covered fluoro-organosilicasol, insulating the metal from corrosive species in the medium. This superhydrophobic coating technique with good stability guaranteed better corrosion protection and also has great potential for application to other polymeric films. In the second section of this dissertation, a brand-new class of Jeffamine-modified fluoro-containing polyimide (denoted as 6FPI-Jx series, where x is ranging from 10, 20, and 30%) was developed. Although existing pristine fluoro-containing polyimide has been considered as promising biomaterial for its good blood compatibility, it has known to be toxic to normal cells. Here, we modified fluoro-containing PI by incorporation of hydrophilic monomer, Jeffamine, which is a commercial polyether diamine product line from Huntsman. Through systematically characterization, the 6FPI-Jx copolymer exhibited good mechanical and stability as pristine 6FPI. Especially when addition of Jeffamine equal of 10%, 6FPI-J10 displayed considerably improved blood and cell compatibility compared to 6FPI, which was explainable as a combined effect of morphological texture and chemical environment of resulting surface. The new class of 6FPI-Jx also exhibited excellent solubility toward a number of organic solvents. The capability of forming homogeneous 6FPI-J10 coating on stainless steel substrate is demonstrated in this research, showing the 6FPI-J10 a great potential candidate as biocompatible coating for implantable medical devices and also for potential therapeutic applications.},

abstract={Doctor ; 유기태양전지와 유무기 하이브리드 페로브스카이트 태양전지에 있어서 광활층으로부터 전자의 추출은 계면층의 특성에 매우 큰 영향을 받는다. 그러나 현재까지 다양한 계면층의 개발에도 불구하고, 계면층의 전하 추출의 역할 및 원리에 대한 체계적인 연구가 보고 되지 않았으므로 본 연구에서는 유기태양전지 및 유무기 하이브리드 페로브스카이트 태양전지에서의 계면층의 역할을 분석하고 고효율 및 장수명을 통한 플렉서블 태양전지의 상용화에 대한 연구를 체계적으로 수행하였다. Chapter 1 에서는 유기태양전지와 유무기 하이브리드 페로브스카이트 태양전지에서 다양하게 개발된 계면층의 역할 및 원리에 대하여 전반적으로 조사하고 분류하여 고성능 장수명의 소자를 제작하기 위한 적합한 계면공학에 대한 이해를 돕고자 하였다. 유기태양전지 및 유무기 하이브리드 페로브스카이트 태양전지에서 각각 사용된 정공추출 / 전자추출 계면층 물질과 광활성층간의 에너지 준위의 단차를 줄여고 quasi-ohmic 접합을 유도하여, 높은 광전변환 효율을 기대할 수 있음을 정리하였다. Chapter 2 에서는 효과적인 계면층으로 최근 많은 연구가 진행되고 있는 공액고분자에 대한 정확한 메커니즘과 양이온/음이온 공액고분자의 다이폴 정렬 방향에 대한 원리를 분석하고 높은 광전변환효율의 유기태양전지를 제작하였다. 공액고분자의 이온기에 의해서 계면다이폴 방향이 결정된다는 기존의 생각과는 다르게 이온기의 종류(+/-)에 상관없이 유기태양전지의 광활성층 표면에 적용되어 결과적으로 같은 방향의 다이폴 정렬을 유도하고 효과적인 전자 추출층으로서 광전변환효율을 크게 증가시켰다. 외부에서 가해지는 전압에 의한 이온 재분배로 인하여 다이폴의 방향을 조절할 수 있으며, 공액고분자 전자추출층은 분자내 다이폴이 아니라 계면에서의 다이폴에 의해 전체 다이폴 방향이 결정됨을 분석하였다. Chapter 3에서는 고분자 정공 추출층으로 가장 널리 사용되고 있는 PEDOT:PSS의 일함수( 4.9-5.1 eV)보다 높게 조절할 수 있는 자가조성 정공추출층을 개발하여 페로브스카이트 태양전지의 이온화 포텐셜(5.4 eV)과 계면에서 에너지 준위 단차 및 저항을 제거한 연구를 진행하였다. 본 연구에 사용된 높은 일함수의 자가조성 정공추출층은 박막 표면의 고분자 조성이 표면에너지 차이에 의하여 스스로 조절되는 물성을 이용하여 정공추출층 내 특정 조성물이 페로브스카이트 광활성층에 접하는 계면에 위치하도록 만들어, 원하는 일함수가 되도록 손쉽게 조절하였다(4.9-5.5 eV). 따라서 자가조성 정공추출층과 광활성층이 접한 계면에서 전력 손실을 최소화 하여, 소자 내부 전위(Vbi)와 개방전압(Voc)을 증가시키고 저항 감소로 인하여 단락전류(Jsc) 및 필팩터(FF)를 증가시켜 광전변환효율을 크게 증가시켰다. 또한 기존 금속 산화물 소재(TiO2 혹은 ZnO)의 다공성 전자 수송층을 사용한 페로브스카이트 태양전지는 깨지기 쉬운 물성으로 인해 외부 응력에 의해 매우 쉽게 소재 균열을 야기하여 휘어지는 소자로 제작할 수 없으나, 본 연구에서 개발한 자가조성 정공추출층을 적용하여 고효율의 플렉서블 페로브스카이트 태양전지를 제작하였다. 또한 자가조성 정공추출층을 유기 및 유무기 하이브리드 페로브스카이트 광활성 물질에 광범위 하게 적용하였을 때 광활성물질의 Valence Band Maxima의 정도에 상관없이 quasi-ohmic한 계면이 되도록 에너지 레벨을 튜닝하였다. 유기 및 유무기 하이브리드 페로브스카이트 광활성 물질에 공통으로 존재하는 midgap 에너지 준위에 정공추출층이 pinning됨을 분석하였으며, 그럼에도 불구하고 자가조성 정공추출층은 일함수 보다 깊은 준위에 interfacial energy state를 가지고 있으므로 quasi-ohmic한 계면이 형성될 수 있음을 분석하였다. 덧붙여서 자가조성 정공추출층을 이용한 소자에서 연속노광 상태에서의 소자수명이 증가함을 관찰하고 분석하였다. Chapter 4에서는 수분산 되어 있어 시간에 따라 침전이 생기고 대면적 박막코팅시에 디펙트가 발생하는 기존의 PEDOT:PSS 정공추출층을 대체하기 위하여 수용해 상태의 PSS grafted PANI를 합성하였다. 이를 유무기 하이브리드 페로브스카이트 태양전지 소자에 적용하여 PSS grafted PANI의 깊은 interfacial energy state에 의해 소자 내부 전위와 개방전압을 크게 증가시켰으며, 높은 투과도로 인해 단락전류 또한 증가시켰다. 또한 낮은 표면 에너지를 가지는 불화이오노머를 이용하여 PSS grafted PANI의 interfacial energy state와 일함수를 더욱 증가시켜서 유무기 하이브리드 페로브스카이트 태양전지의 개방전압 및 광전변환효율을 극대화 시켰다. ; In organic solar cells and organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells, the charge extraction from the photoactive layer to each electrode is critically affected by the interface of the photoactive layer. Although significant progress has been made in organic and organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells, the systematic study of charge extraction in interfacial layer have not been reported so far to the best of our knowledge. In Chapter 1, we will introduce the role of interfacial materials in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PrSCs). Since the various interfacial layers were introduced to the OPVs and PrSCs, the device performance and reliable operation time have been critically increased. The interfacial layer is used to assist charge extraction and decrease the energy offset at organic/electrode interfaces by energy level tuning and the corresponding quasi-ohmic interfacial contact, thus the performance parameters can be significantly increased by the energy level tuning of the interfacial layer for OPVs and PrSCs. In Chapter 2, despite promising function of conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) as an interfacial layer in organic photovoltaics (OPVs), the underlying mechanism of dipole orientation and electrical characteristics of CPE interlayers remain unclear. Currently the ionic functionality of CPEs (i.e. cationic or anionic) is believed to determine the interfacial dipole alignment and the resulting electron or hole extraction properties at the interface between an organic photoactive layer and a metal electrode. In this research, we find that in contrast to this common belief, the photovoltaic efficiency can be significantly improved by both of the cationic and anionic CPE layer regardless of the ion functionaity of CPEs. This improvement occurs because the interfacial dipoles of cationic and anionic CPEs are realigned toward the identical direction despite the different ionic funtionality. Net dipole is determined not by the intrinsic molecular dipole of CPEs but by ionic redistribution in the CPE layer and the resulting interfacial dipole at the intimate contact with adjacent layers. We also demonstrated that the energy level alignment and performance parameters of OPVs can be systematically controlled by the electrically poled CPE layers with the oriented interfacial dipoles; the distribution of positive and negative ions in the CPE layer was adjusted by applying an appropriate external electric field, and the energy alignment was reversible by changing the electric field direction. The cationic and anionic CPEs (PAHFP-Br and PSBFP-Na) based on a same π-conjugated backbone of fluorene-phenylene were used each as the electron extraction layer on a photoactive layer. Both cationic and anionic CPE interlayers improved the energy level alignment at the interface between the photoactive layer and the electrode and the resulting performance parameters, thereby increasing the power conversion efficiency to 8.3 %. In Chapter 3, we present solution-processed methylammonium lead iodide CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite solar cells with a high-WF SOHEL for good energy level alignment with the IP level of CH3NH3PbI3. The SOHEL at the hole extraction interface can increase the built-in potential, the photocurrent, and thus the PCE of perovskite solar cells. We obtained high PCE of 11.7% in SP-PHJ perovskite solar cells under 100-mW/cm2 illumination. We also demonstrated flexible perovskite solar cells on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrate; they had PCE as high as 8.0%. We systematically tailored the work function (WF) of conducting polymer hole extraction layer (HEL) using a self-organized HEL (SOHEL) to improve the device performance and clearly understand the energy level alignment of the HEL with the universal photoactive materials as polymers and orgnic-inorganic hybrid perovskites. We employed P3HT(Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)), PCDTBT(poly[N-9"- heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4´,7´-di-2-thienyl-2´,1´,3´-benzothiadiazole)]), MAPbI3 (methylammonium lead triiodide), and MAPbBr3 (methylammonium lead tribromide) for the photoactive materials with various ionization potential IP. We find the integer charge transfer state of polymer and perovskite materials through the energy level pinning effect depending on the conducting substrate with the difference work function of. Although the Fermi-level of SOHEL becomes pinned to the integer charge transfer state of the donor materials, interface energy state of SOHEL further increases to the IP of the donor materials. Therefore the energy offset between photoactive materials with HEL can be significantly decreased to achieve high Voc and PCE. Furthermore, our SOHEL significantly prolonged the stability of PCDTBT:PC70BM organic solar cells (half life time : 5700h) compared with pristine PEDOT:PSS (300h) under continuous irradiation of air mass-1.5 global simulated sunlight at 100 mW/cm2. We attribute this LT prolongation to the diffusion-blocking ability by the self-organized fluorocarbon layer at the surface of our SOHELs. In Chapter 4, we demonstrate that a water soluble self-doped conducting polyaniline graft copolymer (PSS-g-PANI) was used for a hole extraction layer (HEL) in organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells due to the advantages in terms of the solution processibility, high transmittance, quasi-ohmic contact with perovskite of PSS-g-PANI conducting polymer. Although the work function of PSS-g-PANI (4.99 eV) was similar to that of a conventional water dispersed PEDOT:PSS (4.94 eV), built-in potential and device characteristics are significantly increased due to the deep interfacial energy state of PSS-g-PANI. Moreoever the PSS-g-PANI mixed with self-organized electron withdrawing polymer (perfluorinated ionomer, PFI) exhibited higher work function more (5.49 eV) and the more extended interfacial energy state from Fermi level, thus we could obtain quasi-ohmic energy alignment at HEL/CH3NH3PbI3 interface. When we fabricated perovskite solar cells based on the PSS-g-PANI, power conversion efficiency was increased to 9.7 % and further to 12.4 % in the device based on PSS-g-PANI with PFI.},

abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large class of synthetic (man-made) chemicals widely used in consumer products and industrial processes. The basic structure of PFAS consists of a carbon chain surrounded by fluorine atoms, with different chemicals possessing different end groups; thousands of distinct PFAS exist in commerce. To help address this complex issue, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking a proactive approach. Specifically, the development of human health toxicity assessments for exposure to individual PFAS represents only one component of the broader PFAS action plan underway at the U.S. EPA (https://www.epa.gov/pfas/epas-pfas-action-plan). The five toxicity assessments being developed according to the scope and methods outlined in this protocol build upon several other PFAS assessments that have already been developed. This protocol document presents the methods for conducting the systematic reviews and dose-response analyses for assessments of perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS), and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), and their related salts. This includes a summary of why these specific PFAS were prioritized for evaluation, description of the objectives and specific aims of the assessments, draft populations, exposures, comparators, and outcomes (PECO) criteria, and identification of key areas of scientific complexity.},

abstract={Die vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der spontanen Vesikelbildung in wässrigen Tensidmischungen und der Kontrolle der Vesikelstruktur. Dazu wurden Tensidsysteme aus anionischen Perﬂuortensiden und dem nichtionischen Tetradecyldimethylaminoxid (TDMAO) mit Hilfe des pH-Werts, der Leitfähigkeit, Dynamischer Lichtstreuung (DLS), Viskosität und Neutronenkleinwinkelstreuung (SANS) charakterisiert, um Vesikelbereiche zu identiﬁzieren. Anhand von Neutronenbeugungsexperimenten an gemischten Tensidkristallen aus nichtionischen oder kationischen Kohlenwasserstofftensiden und anionischen Perﬂuortensiden, die Kristalle aus gestapelten Tensiddoppelschichten bilden, konnten Informationen über die Struktur der entsprechenden Tensiddoppelschichten in Vesikeln gefunden werden. Die Bildungskinetik und der Vesikelbildungsmechanismus wurden an ausgewählten Vesikelsystemen aus Lithiumperﬂuoroktylsulfonat (LiPFOS) und TDMAO untersucht, um über den Mechanismus und intermediäre Strukturen, die während der Vesikelbildung auftreten, den Bildungsprozess zu lenken und die Endstrukturen zu beeinﬂussen. Zur Untersuchung wurde die Stopped-ﬂow Methode in Kombination mit SANS, Röntgenkleinwinkelstreuung (SAXS) und DLS als Detektionsmethode verwendet. Die Analyse zeigte, daß sich beim Mischen einer mizellaren TDMAO-Lösung mit einer mizellaren LiPFOS-Lösung erst gemischte Scheibchenmizellen bilden, die bis zu einer maximalen Größe wachsen und sich dann in Vesikel mit einer Polydispersität von nur 5% kurz nach der Bildung umwandeln. Dabei bestimmt die Balance zwischen der Linienspannung des Scheibchenrandes und der Biegesteiﬁgkeit der Membran die Größe der gebildeten Vesikel. Temperaturabhängige Messungen dienten dazu, die Biegesteiﬁgkeit zu bestimmen. Mit Hilfe amphiphiler Copolymere vom Pluronic-Typus (POn-EOm-POn oder EOn-POm-EOn), die sich in den Rand der Tensidscheibchenmizellen einlagern können, konnte die Linienspannung verändert werden und damit die Größe der gebildeten Vesikel kontrolliert werden. Außerdem zeigte sich, daß sich die Polymere nach der Vesikelbildung in die Tensiddoppelschicht einlagern und die Vesikel gegenüber Alterungsprozessen stabilisieren. Systematische Änderungen der Polymerstruktur gaben Auskunft über den Einﬂuß der Polymerarchitektur auf den Vesikelbildungsprozess und die Vesikelgröße und auf die Stabilität der gebildeten Vesikel. Dabei zeigte sich, daß die Vesikelgröße mit der Polymerkonzentration und der Anzahl der Propylenoxidgruppen (PO) zunahm während die Vesikel umso stabiler waren je größer die Anzahl der Ethylenoxidgruppen (EO) war. Ob der Polymerkern aus Polyethylenoxid oder aus Polypropylenoxid bestand hatte keinen signiﬁkanten Einﬂuß auf die Vesikelstruktur und die Stabilität. ; In this work a study about the spontaneous vesicle formation in aqueous surfactant mixtures and the control over the vesicle structure is presented. For that purpose surfactant systems consisting of anionic perﬂuoro surfactants and the nonionic tetradecyldimethylamine oxide (TDMAO) were characterised by means of the pH value, conductivity, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), viscosity and Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) in order to identify vesicle phase regions. By means of Neutron Diffraction experiments on mixed surfactant crystals consisting of nonionic or cationic hydrocarbon surfactants and anionic perﬂuoro surfactants, that form crystals of stacked surfactant bilayers, information about the structure of correspondent surfactant bilayers in vesicles could be found. The kinetics and the mechanism of vesicle formation were investigated in selected vesicle systems consisting of lithium perﬂuorooctylsulfonate (LiPFOS) and TDMAO in order to control the formation process and in order to inﬂuence the ﬁnal aggregate structures via the mechanism of formation and intermediate structures. Investigations were carried out with the stopped-ﬂow mixing in combination with SANS, Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and DLS as methods of detection. The analysis shows, that upon mixing a micellar TDMAO solution with a micellar LiPFOS solution, ﬁrst mixed disc-like micelles are formed that grow up to a maximum size and then transform into vesicles with a polydispersity of only 5% shortly after formation. The balance between the line tension of the disc rim and the bending elasticity of the membrane determines the size of the formed vesicles. Temperature dependent measurements were performed in order to determine the bending elasticity. Amphiphilic copolymers of the pluronic type (POn-EOm-POn or EOn-POm-EOn) can be incorporated into the rim of the disc-like surfactant micelles and thereby can alter the line tension and as a result controls the size of the formed vesicles. Furthermore measurements revealed that the polymers are incorporated into the surfactant membrane during the vesicle formation and stabilise the vesicles against ageing processes. Systematic variations of the polymer structure allowed to obtain information about the inﬂuence of the polymer architecture on the vesicle formation process and the vesicle size and on the stability of the formed vesicles. As a result it could be shown that the vesicle size increases with the polymer concentration and the number of propylene oxide groups (PO), while the stability increases with the number of ethylene oxide groups (EO). Whether the polymer backbone consisted of polyethylene oxide or of polypropylene oxide had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the vesicle structure and stability.},
