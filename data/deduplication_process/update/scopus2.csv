We begin in this article by reviewing the available literature on the levels of POPs over the TP. In general, the levels of most POPs are similar or lower than values reported for other background regions. However, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) levels in air and soil far exceed those measured in other mountainous areas. The East Asian monsoon, Indian Monsoon and westerly winds are responsible for the long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT) and arrival of POPs over the TP. Surface soil and vegetation act as “final sinks” for DDTs and other high molecular weight POPs. Linked to the continuous use of POPs in surrounding counties, LRAT and “cold trapping” by the TP can happen following emission–transport–deposition events, leading to the enrichment of POPs in the TP environment. Bioaccumulation of DDTs and high chlorinated PCBs have been found in Tibetan terrestrial and aquatic food chains, and newly emerging compounds such as polyfluoroalkyl substances and hexabromocyclododecanes have been widely detected in wild fish species. The corresponding ecological risks should be of great concern. Climate change, such as increased temperatures and changing coverage of snow and glaciers, has the potential to affect the behavior and distribution of POPs. Therefore, long-term monitoring data are required. Ineffective regulation regarding POPs has been reported for countries in South Asia, emissions patterns, the outflow of POPs, and their seasonal and inter-annual variability should therefore be clarified. Estimating the loading of POPs, as well as how they move, within the TP, especially under the impact of glacial melt and global warming, should be a priority. © 2016","Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Biochemistry; Chemical contamination; Climate change; Ecology; Global warming; Pollution; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane; Long-range atmospheric transports; Long-term monitoring datum; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Persistent organic pollutants; Sink; Source; Tibetan Plateau; Organic pollutants; chemical compound; chlorphenotane; hexabromocyclododecane; hexachlorobenzene; hexachlorocyclohexane; organic carbon; organic matter; perfluoroalkyl acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; polychlorinated naphthalene; rain; snow; unclassified drug; chlorphenotane; lindane; atmospheric transport; bioaccumulation; climate change; DDT; fish; future prospect; HCH; long range transport; persistent organic pollutant; air pollution; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric transport; bioaccumulation; climate change; concentration (parameters); environmental temperature; fish; food chain; human; nonhuman; persistent organic pollutant; pollution; priority journal; Review; soil pollution; surface soil; Tibet; vegetation; water pollution; yak; air pollutant; analysis; environmental monitoring; forecasting; procedures; wind; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Air Pollutants; Climate Change; DDT; Environmental Monitoring; Forecasting; Lindane; Tibet; Wind"

The FTS reaction has received many attentions due to a limited petroleum resource with an increased demand for using alternative carbon sources such as stranded gas or shale gas. Some proper synthetic methods of an effective FTS catalyst having a larger active metal surface area and a lower deactivation rate are the most important issues for a long-term operation. Therefore, some ordered mesoporous materials (OMM) have been widely investigated in the field of CO hydrogenation using some heterogeneous catalysts. The present brief review paper summarized the various preparation methods of the ordered mesoporous materials for the possible applications of FTS reaction with a lower deactivation rate and a higher catalytic performance. The applications of the ordered mesoporous cobalt oxides for FTS reaction are briefly introduced and the ways to improve a structural stability even under reductive CO hydrogenation conditions by using efficient pillaring materials as well as by preparing mixed metal oxides. A higher catalytic activity of the ordered mesoporous cobalt oxide was also verified in a multi-channel fixed-bed compact reactor having the intersected interlayers of micro-channel heat exchanger. The thermal stability of ordered mesoporous cobalt-based catalysts was mainly affected by a structural stability which can easily remove the heavy hydrocarbons from the inner surfaces. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

In these cells, a hydrated polymer membrane acts as an electrolyte layer through which protons travel. Due to the complex nature of the membranes used, the optimization of fuel cell performance is a difficult task, and relies on a number of factors, such as hydration level, polymer side chain length and composition, equivalent weight, morphology, and chemical and mechanical stabilities. Molecular dynamics is a particularly powerful tool for studying PEMs, as it provides the computational efficiency to study length and time scales relevant to these systems. In this review, we present results from several computational papers that use reactive molecular dynamics, which explicitly describe bond breaking and formation, to study proton transport in several polymers commonly used in PEMs. The results presented demonstrate the importance of the interaction between hydronium and the charged side chains and the morphology on the performance of PEM fuel cells.

Evolution has equipped these molecules with superior drug-like properties such as high specificity and potency. However, native peptides and proteins suffer from an inadequate pharmacokinetic profile, and their outstanding pharmacological potential can only be realized if this issue is addressed during drug development. To overcome this challenge, a variety of half-life extension techniques relying on covalent chemical modification have been developed. These methods include PEGylation, fusion to unstructured polypeptide-based PEG mimetics, conjugation of large polysaccharides, native-like glycosylation, lipidation, fusion to albumin or the Fc domain of IgG, and derivatization with bio-orthogonal moieties that direct self-assembly. This review provides an overview of available conjugation chemistries, biophysical properties, and safety data associated with these concepts.

Over the course of his scientific career, Eckhard R. Podack made several seminal discoveries that elucidated key aspects of this warfare at a molecular level. When Eckhard joined the complement laboratory of Müller-Eberhard in 1974, he was fascinated by two questions: (1) what is the molecular mechanism by which complement kills invasive bacteria? and (2) which one of the complement components is the killer molecule? Eckhard's quest to answer these questions would lead to the discovery C9 and later, two additional pore-forming killer molecules of the immune system. Here is a brief account of how he discovered poly-C9, the pore-forming protein of complement in blood and interstitial fluids: Perforin-1, expressed by natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes; and Perforin-2 (MPEG1), expressed by all cell types examined to date. All the three killing systems are crucial for our survival and health. © 2016 Podack and Munson.","complement component C3; complement component C5b; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; decay accelerating factor; lymphotoxin; perforin; tumor necrosis factor; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; electron microscopy; immunity; microorganism; natural killer cell; neoplasm; nonhuman; Review; ultracentrifugation"

The complement system, a crucial part of innate immunity, plays an important role in this process. Thus, apoptotic and necrotic cells are recognized by complement initiators such as C1q, mannose binding lectin, ficolins, and properdin. This triggers complement activation and opsonization of cells with fragments of C3b, which enhances phagocytosis and thus ensures silent removal. Importantly, the process is tightly controlled by the binding of complement inhibitors C4b-binding protein and factor H, which attenuates late steps of complement activation and inflammation. Furthermore, factor H becomes actively internalized by apoptotic cells, where it catalyzes the cleavage of intracellular C3 to C3b. The intracellularly derived C3b additionally opsonizes the cell surface further supporting safe and fast clearance and thereby aids to prevent autoimmunity. Internalized factor H also binds nucleosomes and directs monocytes into production of anti-inflammatory cytokines upon phagocytosis of such complexes. Disturbances in the complement-mediated clearance of dying cells result in persistence of autoantigens and development of autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus, and may also be involved in development of age-related macula degeneration. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In this study, we conducted a continuous monitoring program over the period 2011–2014 with seasonal monitoring in 2013 for PFAAs emitted from two rapidly developing fluorochemical industry parks located in the Daling River Basin, Northern China. The trend of PFAA contamination was identified, dominated by perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), with the maximum concentrations of 3.78 μg/L, 3.70 μg/L, and 1.95 μg/L, respectively. Seasonal monitoring uncovered the occasional emission of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). Construction trends of new facilities and associated manufacturing capacity of the main products were also analyzed to assess correlations with PFAA emissions. An assessment of the data over the period 2011–2014 found a positive correlation with fluorocarbon alcohol (FCA) production and emission of PFAAs. Groundwater and tap water around the main source indicated that the dominant PFAAs had different diffusion behaviors. PFBS levels were higher in surface water, while PFBA was dominant in groundwater and tap water, with PFOA levels being higher in downstream groundwater. Considering the continuous expansion and development of fluorochemical industry in the Daling River Basin, this study will provide abundant information on the effectiveness of risk assessment and management. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Chains; Groundwater; Manufacture; Rivers; Surface waters; Watersheds; PFBA; PFBS; PFOA; Seasonal trends; Yearly trend; Risk assessment; alcohol; fluorocarbon; fluorocarbon alcohol; ground water; haloacid; perfluoroalkane sulfonic acid; perfluoroalkyl acid; perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid; perfluorobutane sulfonic acid; perfluorobutanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; river water; surface water; tap water; unclassified drug; water pollutant; emission; environmental monitoring; risk assessment; river pollution; seasonal variation; chemical industry; China; concentration (parameters); controlled study; diffusion; environmental monitoring; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; Review; seasonal variation; water contamination; water sampling; chemistry; environmental monitoring; procedures; time factor; water pollutant; China; Chemical Industry; China; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Time Factors; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Lipids comprised of Fatty Acids (FA) play many important roles in the physiology and life history of fishes. Toxic effects of OC are partly dependent on its bioaccumulation in the lipids of aquatic organisms due its physicochemical properties. Therefore, there is an increasing interest to investigate the gene expression as well as the presence and activity of proteins involved in FA metabolism. The attention on Peroxisome Proliferation Activate Receptors (PPARs) also prevails in fish species exposed to OC and in the transport, biosynthesis and β-oxidation of FA. Several studies have been conducted under controlled conditions to evaluate these biological aspects of fish species exposed to OC, as fibrates, endocrine disrupting compounds, perfluoroalkyl acids, flame retardants, metals and mixtures of organic compounds associated with a polluted area. However, only fibrates, which are agonists of PPARs, induce biological responses suitable to be considered as biomarkers of exposure to these pollutants. According to the documented findings on this topic, it is unlikely that these physiological aspects are suitable to be employed as biomarkers with some noticeable exceptions, which depend on experimental design. This emphasises the need to investigate the responses in fish treated with mixtures of OC and in wild fish species from polluted areas to validate or refute the suitability of these biomarkers for environmental or fish health monitoring. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Aquatic organisms; Biochemistry; Biomarkers; Cytology; Endocrine disrupters; Fish; Flame retardants; Gene expression; Lipids; Metabolism; Mixtures; Physiology; Pollution; Aquatic environments; Controlled conditions; Endocrine disrupting compound; Environmental Monitoring; Fatty acid metabolism; Perfluoroalkyl acids; Physicochemical property; PPARs; Fatty acids; biological marker; endocrine disruptor; fibric acid derivative; flame retardant; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; pesticide; plasticizer; biological marker; endocrine disruptor; fatty acid; fish protein; organic compound; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; water pollutant; xenobiotic agent; biomarker; environmental monitoring; fatty acid; fish; metabolism; organic pollutant; physiological response; pollution exposure; bioaccumulation; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid synthesis; fatty acid transport; fish; gene expression; hydrophobicity; nonhuman; physical chemistry; pollution monitoring; pollution transport; protein function; Review; water pollution; animal; drug effects; environmental monitoring; fish; lipid metabolism; metabolism; procedures; toxicity; water pollutant; Pisces; Animals; Biomarkers; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Monitoring; Fatty Acids; Fish Proteins; Fishes; Lipid Metabolism; Organic Chemicals; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Xenobiotics"

In fluoroalkylation reactions, fluorine substitution can dramatically influence the chemical outcome. On the one hand, the chemistry of alkylation with non-fluorinated reagents may not be applicable to fluoroalkylations, so it is necessary to tackle the fluorine effects to achieve efficient fluoroalkylation reactions. On the other hand, fluorine substitution may bring about new reactivities and transformations that cannot be realized in alkylation with non-fluorinated reagents; thus, fluorine substitution can be used to explore new synthetic methods.

The relation of PFASs to fertility has now been examined in a relatively large number of epidemiologic studies and a synthesis is in order. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFASs and measures of human fertility, with particular emphasis on perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Systematic literature searches were initially conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE and subsequently in references and citations of included papers. Studies were included if they assessed exposure to PFASs in biological samples in relation to reproductive hormones, semen characteristics, or time to pregnancy (TTP). Study characteristics and results were abstracted to predefined forms, and the studies were assessed for the risk of bias and confounding. Sixteen studies investigated the association between PFAS exposure in men and semen parameters, reproductive hormone levels, or TTP. There was a lack of consistent results among the numerous investigated exposure-outcome combinations. However, subtle associations between higher PFOS and lower testosterone or abnormal semen morphology cannot be excluded. Eleven studies assessed the association between PFAS exposure in women and TTP or reproductive hormones levels. Four of eight studies found prolonged TTP with higher PFOS or PFOA, but only one study found an association when restricting to nulliparous women. In men, there is little evidence of an association between PFAS exposure and semen quality or levels of reproductive hormones. For PFOS and PFOA, the literature indicates an association with female fecundability in parous women, which is most likely not causal. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","alkyl group; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pollutant; environmental exposure; female; fertility; hormone determination; human; infertility; male; outcome assessment; Review; risk assessment; semen analysis; systematic review; time to pregnancy; drug effects; fertility; pollutant; reproduction; toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Environmental Pollutants; Fertility; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Reproduction"

Trifluoroacetic acid is (1) produced naturally and synthetically, (2) used in the chemical industry, and (3) a potential environmental breakdown product of a large number (>1 million) chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and polymers. The contribution of these chemicals to global amounts of TFA is uncertain, in contrast to that from HCFC and HFC regulated under the MP. TFA salts are stable in the environment and accumulate in terminal sinks such as playas, salt lakes, and oceans, where the only process for loss of water is evaporation. Total contribution to existing amounts of TFA in the oceans as a result of the continued use of HCFCs, HFCs, and hydrofluoroolefines (HFOs) up to 2050 is estimated to be a small fraction (<7.5%) of the approximately 0.2 μg acid equivalents/L estimated to be present at the start of the millennium. As an acid or as a salt TFA is low to moderately toxic to a range of organisms. Based on current projections of future use of HCFCs and HFCs, the amount of TFA formed in the troposphere from substances regulated under the MP is too small to be a risk to the health of humans and environment. However, the formation of TFA derived from degradation of HCFC and HFC warrants continued attention, in part because of a long environmental lifetime and due many other potential but highly uncertain sources. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","alkene derivative; bicalutamide; celecoxib; chemical compound; chlorofluorohydrocarbon; efavirenz; fluorinated hydrocarbon; fluoxetine; hydrofluoroolefin derivative; perfluoro compound; pesticide; rain; reagent; snow; sodium chloride; surface water; trifluoroacetic acid; unclassified drug; water; inorganic salt; pollutant; trifluoroacetic acid; aquatic species; atmosphere; bioaccumulation; biodegradation; chemistry; ecosystem; ecotoxicity; environment; environmental exposure; environmental impact; evaporation; food chain; health hazard; human; mammal; nonhuman; physical chemistry; radiometric dating; Review; risk; risk assessment; salt lake; sea; soil; solubility; terrestrial species; troposphere; uncertainty; water loss; analysis; animal; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; pollutant; Animals; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Salts; Trifluoroacetic Acid"

It is required for healing wounds and infections. Despite their indispensable role in microbial killing, the inflammation reactions may also cause diseases to a host such as hay fever, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The enzymes and oxidizing species released during the inflammatory process can cause damages to the host tissues which lead to inflammatory syndromes. The role of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the inflammatory reactions is well documented. It contributes in killing the pathogens but it is also implicated in several inflammatory syndromes such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis. Thus, this enzyme has attracted more attention of the scientists and it has become a target for drug designing. In the last decade, several reversible and irreversible MPO inhibitors were identified as very high potent inhibitors such as fluoroalkylindole, aromatic hydroxamic acid, thioxanthine and benzoic acid hydrazide derivatives.

Immobilization of biomolecules onto polymer surfaces and the construction of bioconjugates are essential requirements of many biochemical assays and chemical syntheses. Different linkers with a variety of functional groups are used for these purposes. Among them, the benzophenones, aryldiazirines, and arylazides represent the most commonly used photolinker to produce the desired chemical linkage upon their photo-irradiation. In this review, we describe the versatile applications of 4-fluoro-3-nitrophenyl azide, one of the oldest photolinkers used for photoaffinity labeling in the late 1960s. Surprisingly, this photolinker, historically known as 1-fluoro-2-nitro-4-azidobenzene (FNAB), has remained unexplored for a long time because of apprehension that FNAB forms ring-expanded dehydroazepine as a major product and hence cannot activate an inert polymer. The first evidence of photochemical activation of an inert surface by FNAB through nitrene insertion reaction was reported in 2001, and the FNAB-activated surface was found to conjugate a biomolecule without any catalyst, reagent, or modification. FNAB has distinct advantages over perfluorophenyl azide derivatives, which are contemporary nitrene-generating photolinkers, because of its simple, single-step preparation and ease of thermochemical and photochemical reactions with versatile polymers and biomolecules. Covering these aspects, the present review highlights the flexible chemistry of FNAB and its applications in the field of surface engineering, immobilization of biomolecules such as antibodies, enzymes, cells, carbohydrates, oligonucleotides, and DNA aptamers, and rapid diagnostics.

These compounds are chemically very stable and are highly resistant to biological degradation. Currently, humans are at increased risk as PFCs are resistant to hydrolysis, photolysis, microbial degradation, or metabolism, and their estimated elimination half-life is about 3.8 years. Therefore, the scale of the bioaccumulation of PFCs in humans is not fully known.

Despite these early warnings, the problems of groundwater, and thus drinking water, contaminated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) including PFOS are only beginning to be addressed. It is clear that this PFAS contamination is poorly reversible and that the societal costs of clean-up will be high. This inability to reverse exposure in a reasonable timeframe is a major motivation for application of the precautionary principle in chemicals management. We conclude that exposure can be poorly reversible; 1) due to slow elimination kinetics in organisms, or 2) due to poorly reversible environmental contamination that leads to continuous exposure. In the second case, which is relevant for contaminated groundwater, the reversibility of exposure is not related to the magnitude of a chemical's bioaccumulation potential. We argue therefore that all PFASs entering groundwater, irrespective of their perfluoroalkyl chain length and bioaccumulation potential, will result in poorly reversible exposures and risks as well as further clean-up costs for society. To protect groundwater resources for future generations, society should consider a precautionary approach to chemicals management and prevent the use and release of highly persistent and mobile chemicals such as PFASs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Chemicals; Contamination; Fire extinguishers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Potable water; Bioaccumulation potential; Chemicals management; Environmental contamination; Microgram-per-liter level; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; PFASs; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Precautionary principle; Groundwater pollution; alkyl group; drinking water; fluoride; ground water; perfluoroalkane sulfonyl fluoride; perfluoroalkyl acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; surface water; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; ground water; bioaccumulation; chemical pollutant; drinking water; groundwater pollution; organic acid; persistent organic pollutant; precautionary principle; reaction kinetics; bioaccumulation; case study; concentration (parameters); cost benefit analysis; environmental exposure; environmental management; human; limit of detection; priority journal; Review; sediment; soil analysis; water analysis; water pollution; prevention and control; water pollutant; water pollution; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Groundwater; Humans; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution"

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – As alternative to traditional analyzers, chemosensors, operate according to physical principles, without sample collection (online), and are capable of supplying parameter values continuously and in real-time. Their low selectivity and stability issues have been overcome by technological developments. This review paper contains a comprehensive survey of existing and expected online monitoring technologies for measurement/detection of pollutants in water. Findings – The state-of-the-art in online water monitoring is presented. Application examples are reported. Monitoring costs will become a lesser part of a water utility budget due to the fact that automation and technological simplification will abate human cost factors, and reduce the complexity of laboratory procedures.

The long retention times and large surface areas exposed to light potentially allow more opportunities for EC removal to occur, but experimental evidence is lacking to enable definite predictions about EC fate across different algal WWT systems. This study reviews the mechanisms of EC hydrolysis, sorption, biodegradation, and photodegradation, applying available knowledge to the case of algal WWT. From this basis the review identifies three main areas that need more research due to the unique environmental and ecological conditions occurring in algal WWT ponds: i) the effect of diurnally fluctuating pH and dissolved oxygen upon removal mechanisms; ii) the influence of algae and algal biomass on biodegradation and sorption under relevant conditions; and iii) the significance of EC photodegradation in the presence of dissolved and suspended materials. Because of the high concentration of dissolved organics typically found in algal WWT ponds, most EC photodegradation likely occurs via indirect mechanisms rather than direct photolysis in these systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Algae; Antibiotics; Biodegradation; Dissolution; Dissolved oxygen; Drug products; Impurities; Lakes; Photodegradation; Photolysis; Ponds; Ecological conditions; Emerging contaminant; Emerging contaminant (ECs); Emerging pollutants; Estrogen; Experimental evidence; HRAP; Waste-water treatment ponds; Wastewater treatment; antibiotic agent; dissolved oxygen; surface water; water; waste water; alga; antibiotics; biodegradation; estrogenic compound; hydrolysis; organic pollutant; photodegradation; pollutant removal; pond; research work; sorption; wastewater; water treatment; alga; antibiotic resistance; biodegradation; conjugation; degradation; human; hydrolysis; microbial biomass; nonhuman; pH; photodegradation; pond; Review; waste component removal; waste water management; water contamination; biomass; bioremediation; chemistry; metabolism; microalga; photolysis; pond; sewage; waste water; algae; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biomass; Microalgae; Photolysis; Ponds; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water"

Traditionally, PFASs are produced via two major manufacturing processes: electrochemical fluorination (ECF) and telomerization. Due to their persistence, toxicity and bioaccumulation, ECF-associated chemicals perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (POSF) are placed into the Annex B of the Stockholm Convention (SC) on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in 2009. The ECF production has also been phased out gradually in the developed countries. However, the production of fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) by telomerization has increased significantly. Recent studies have demonstrated that the biotransformation and abiotic transformation of FTOHs yielded perfluocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), which may be router for the ubiquitous distribution of PFCAs. Besides, some of the FTOHs intermediate metabolites have been demonstrated to be able to covalently bind with various biomolecules and thereby cause serious toxicity, while the final metabolites are showed to cause hepatotoxicity and renal toxicity. Recently, the environmental problems related to FTOHs have become the hotspots in environmental science, toxicology and epidemiology. This paper reviews the research progress on the production status, environmental occurrence, and the toxicities of FTOHs and the related metabolites.

Industrial chemical production has increased over the past 30 to 40 years. Basic science, animal models, and epidemiologic data suggest that certain chemicals may act as endocrine disruptors (substances that interfere with normal hormonal action) and may play an etiologic role in a number of conditions whose incidence has also increased during this same period. These include low birth weight, gestational diabetes, obesity, certain cancers, certain birth defects, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit disorder and autism. In addition, some environmental chemicals may have epigenetic effects, resulting in transgenerational health impacts. The epidemiologic and experimental evidence that links chemicals such as plasticizers (eg, phthalates and phenols), flame retardants, perfluorinated compounds, and pesticides with adverse reproductive health outcomes is reviewed. Women's health care providers are the liaison between scientific research and their patients; they should educate themselves on the significance of environmental toxins to health. They are ideally positioned, not only to counsel and reassure pregnant women, but also to suggest practicable changes in dietary and lifestyle habits to improve their health.

When assembly occurs on a target cell membrane the forming complex inserts into and through the bilayer to create a pore, the membrane attack complex (MAC). On some targets, pore formation causes rapid lytic destruction; however, most nucleated cell targets resist lysis through a combination of ion pumps, membrane regulators and active recovery processes. Cells survive but not without consequence. The MAC pore causes ion fluxes and directly or indirectly impacts several important signalling pathways that in turn activate a diverse series of events in the cell, many of which are highly pro-inflammatory. Although this non-lytic, pro-inflammatory role of MAC has been recognised for thirty years, no consensus signalling pathway has emerged.

Neurotoxicity has been recognized as a major public health problem. The Chinese government, research institutes, and scientists conducted extensive studies concerning the source, characteristics, and mechanisms of neurotoxicants. Objectives: This paper presents, for the first time, a comprehensive history and review of major sources of neurotoxicants, national bodies/legislation engaged, and major neurotoxicology research in China. Methods: Peer-reviewed research and pollution studies by Chinese scientists from 1991 to 2015 were examined. PubMed, Web of Science and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were the major search tools. Results: The central problem is an increased exposure to neurotoxicants from air and water, food contamination, e-waste recycling, and manufacturing of household products. China formulated an institutional framework and standards system for management of major neurotoxicants. Basic and applied research was initiated, and international cooperation was achieved. The annual number of peer-reviewed neurotoxicology papers from Chinese authors increased almost 30-fold since 2001. Conclusions: Despite extensive efforts, neurotoxicity remains a significant public health problem. This provides great challenges and opportunities. We identified 10 significant areas that require major educational, environmental, governmental, and research efforts, as well as attention to public awareness. For example, there is a need to increase efforts to utilize new in vivo and in vitro models, determine the potential neurotoxicity and mechanisms involved in newly emerging pollutants, and examine the effects and mechanisms of mixtures. In the future, we anticipate working with scientists worldwide to accomplish these goals and eliminate, prevent and treat neurotoxicity. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The work emphasizes molecular structure and intermolecular self-organization that typically determine transport and optical emission in π-conjugated oligomers and polymers. In this context, hydrostatic pressure through diamond anvil cells has proven to be an elegant tool to control structure and interactions without chemical intervention. This has been highlighted by high pressure optical spectroscopy whilst analogous x-ray diffraction experiments remain less frequent. By focusing on a class of blue-emitting π-conjugated polymers, polyfluorenes, this article reviews optical spectroscopic studies under hydrostatic pressure, addressing the impact of molecular and intermolecular interactions on optical excitations, electron-phonon interaction, and changes in backbone conformations. This picture is connected to the optical high pressure studies of other π-conjugated systems and emerging x-ray scattering experiments from polyfluorenes which provides a structure-property map of pressure-driven intra- and interchain interactions.

Accordingly, this article systematically and critically reviews the epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFOA and PFOS and various immune-related health conditions in humans. Twenty-four epidemiologic studies have reported associations of PFOA and/or PFOS with immune-related health conditions, including ten studies of immune biomarker levels or gene expression patterns, ten studies of atopic or allergic disorders, five studies of infectious diseases, four studies of vaccine responses, and five studies of chronic inflammatory or autoimmune conditions (with several studies evaluating multiple endpoints). Asthma, the most commonly studied condition, was evaluated in seven studies. With few, often methodologically limited studies of any particular health condition, generally inconsistent results, and an inability to exclude confounding, bias, or chance as an explanation for observed associations, the available epidemiologic evidence is insufficient to reach a conclusion about a causal relationship between exposure to PFOA and PFOS and any immune-related health condition in humans. When interpreting such studies, an immunodeficiency should not be presumed to exist when there is no evidence of a clinical abnormality.

IgAN is diagnosed from pathological assessment of a renal biopsy specimen based on predominant or codominant IgA-containing immunodeposits, usually with complement C3 co-deposits and with variable presence of IgG and/or IgM. The IgA in these renal deposits is galactose-deficient IgA1, with less than a full complement of galactose residues on the O-glycans in the hinge region of the heavy chains. Research from the past decade led to the definition of IgAN as an autoimmune disease with a multi-hit pathogenetic process with contributing genetic and environmental components. In this process, circulating galactose-deficient IgA1 (autoantigen) is bound by antiglycan IgG or IgA (autoantibodies) to form immune complexes. Some of these circulating complexes deposit in glomeruli, and thereby activate mesangial cells and induce renal injury through cellular proliferation and overproduction of extracellular matrix components and cytokines/chemokines. Glycosylation pathways associated with production of the autoantigen and the unique characteristics of the corresponding autoantibodies in patients with IgAN have been uncovered. Complement likely plays a significant role in the formation and the nephritogenic activities of these complexes. Complement activation is mediated through the alternative and lectin pathways and probably occurs systemically on IgA1-containing circulating immune complexes as well as locally in glomeruli. Incidence of IgAN varies greatly by geographical location; the disease is rare in central Africa but accounts for up to 40% of native-kidney biopsies in eastern Asia. Some of this variation may be explained by genetically determined influences on the pathogenesis of the disease. Genome-wide association studies to date have identified several loci associated with IgAN. Some of these loci are associated with the increased prevalence of IgAN, whereas others, such as deletion of complement factor H-related genes 1 and 3, are protective against the disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms and genetic and biochemical factors involved in formation and activities of pathogenic IgA1-containing immune complexes will enable the development of future disease-specific therapies as well as identification of non-invasive disease-specific biomarkers. © 2016 Knoppova, Reily, Maillard, Rizk, Moldoveanu, Mestecky, Raska, Renfrow, Julian and Novak.","asialoglycoprotein receptor; autoantibody; B cell activating factor; complement component C1q; complement component C2; complement component C3; complement component C4; complement component C5a; complement component C5b; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; epidermal growth factor; galactose; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin A antibody; immunoglobulin G antibody; interleukin 6; leukemia inhibitory factor; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; amino acid sequence; anaphylactoid purpura; antigen antibody complex; complement activation; complementarity determining region; electron transport; genetic association; glycosylation; human; immune complex nephritis; immunofluorescence test; immunoglobulin production; immunoglobulin structure; kidney biopsy; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; pathogenesis; protein degradation; Review; single nucleotide polymorphism"

Generally, modification is desired at a single site to maintain homogeneity and to minimise loss of function. Though protein modification can be achieved by targeting some natural amino acid side chains, this often leads to ill-defined and randomly modified proteins. Amongst the natural amino acids, cysteine combines advantageous properties contributing to its suitability for site-selective modification, including a unique nucleophilicity, and a low natural abundance - both allowing chemo- and regioselectivity. Native cysteine residues can be targeted, or Cys can be introduced at a desired site in a protein by means of reliable genetic engineering techniques. This review on chemical protein modification through cysteine should appeal to those interested in modifying proteins for a range of applications. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Recently, C4/C4 PFPiA and its derivatives have been presented as alternatives to long-chain PFASs in certain applications. In this study, we systematically assess the publicly available information on the hazardous properties, occurrence, and exposure routes of PFPAs and PFPiAs, and make comparisons to the corresponding properties of their better-known carboxylic and sulfonic acid analogs (i.e. PFCAs and PFSAs). This comparative assessment indicates that [i] PFPAs likely have high persistence and long-range transport potential; [ii] PFPiAs may transform to PFPAs (and possibly PFCAs) in the environment and biota [iii] certain PFPAs and PFPiAs can only be slowly eliminated from rainbow trout and rats, similarly to long-chain PFCAs and PFSAs; [iv] PFPAs and PFPiAs have modes-of-action that are both similar to, and different from, those of PFCAs and PFSAs; and [v] the measured levels of PFPAs/PFPiAs in the global environment and biota appear to be low in comparison to PFCAs and PFSAs, suggesting, for the time being, low risks from PFPAs and PFPiAs alone. Although risks from individual PFPAs/PFPiAs are currently low, their ongoing production and use and high persistence will lead to increasing exposure and risks over time. Furthermore, simultaneous exposure to PFPAs, PFPiAs and other PFASs may result in additive effects necessitating cumulative risk assessments.

Electrochemical oxidation (EO) is a promising remediation technique for wastewater contaminated with PFCs. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that the ""non-active"" anodes, including boron-doped diamond, tin oxide, and lead dioxide, are effective in PFCs elimination in wastewater due to their high oxygen evolution potential. Many researchers have conducted experiments to investigate the optimal conditions (i.e., potential, current density, pH value, plate distance, initial PFCs concentration, electrolyte, and other factors) for PFCs elimination to obtain the maximal elimination efficiency and current efficiency. The EO mechanism and pathways of PFCs have been clearly elucidated, which undergo electron transfer, Kolbe decarboxylation or desulfonation, hydrolysis, and radical reaction. In addition, the safety evaluation and energy consumption evaluation of the EO technology have also been summarized to decrease toxic ion release from electrode and reduce the cost of this technique. Although the ultrasonication and hydrothermal techniques combined with the EO process can improve the removal efficiency and current efficiency significantly, these coupled techniques have not been commercialized and applied in industrial wastewater treatment.

As a consequence of eutrophication, microcystins have become widely disseminated in drinking water sources, seriously impairing drinking water quality. This review focuses on the relationship between microcystins synthesis and physical, chemical, and biological environmental factors that are significant in controlling their production. Light intensity and temperature are the more important physical factors, and in many cases, an optimum level for these two factors has been observed. Nitrogen and phosphorus are the key chemical factors causing frequent occurrence of harmful algal blooms and microcystins production. The absorption of nutrients and metabolic activities of algae are affected by different concentrations and forms of nitrogen and phosphorus, leading to variations in microcystins production Metal ions and emerging pollutants are other significant chemical factors, whose comprehensive impact is still being studied. Algae can also interact with biological agents like predators and competitors in aquatic environments, and such interactions are suggested to promote MCs production and release. This review further highlights areas that require further research in order to gain a better understanding of microcystins production.

While such compounds have been environmentally present for some time, new pharmaceuticals and replacements for other ECs phased out due to regulatory limitations are continually being introduced to market. Non-target lower organisms are exposed through affected water, atmospheric emissions, precipitation, sediments, among other routes. Biological disruption/dysfunction (such as endocrine, developmental, and epigenetic disruption) has been reported in lower organisms exposed to trace levels of PPCPs and other ECs. Such disruption/dysfunction may not be exclusively present as traditional toxic response (e.g., cancer or death) but may only slightly alter natural biological processes as a result of exposure to an exogenous chemical (e.g., an increased heart rate or altered size of dorsal fat pads in fish). The epigenome and endocrine system appear to be relatively sensitive to many PPCPs/ECs, particularly during early development.Humans are exposed to ECs such as plasticizers and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) mainly through ingestion (food and contaminated liquid) as well as interaction with day-to-day products (detergents, musk compounds in fragrances, etc.). Few, if any, studies have investigated trace-level toxicity of such ECs to humans as direct-exposure trials are highly unethical. However, numerous epidemiological links exist between the presence of contaminants in humans (blood, urine, and tissues) and the occurrence of diseases or other phenotypic alterations. Despite mounting interest and research, such trace-level effects on humans are greatly debated and often criticized.This paper reviews the current understanding of PPCP/EC toxicity. Discussion of general biological disruption/dysfunction of the following seven classes of PPCP/ECs is included: analgesics, antibiotics, antineoplastic compounds, beta-blockers, endocrine disrupting compounds, PFCs, and plasticizers.

A part of innate immunity, the complement system, is an important player in the induction and progression of atherosclerosis. The accumulation of either oxidized or enzymatically modified LDL—bound to C-reactive protein or not—prompts complement activation leading to the assembly of the terminal complement C5b-9 complex in the atherosclerotic lesion. The sublytic C5b-9 assembly leads to the activation and proliferation of smooth muscle and endothelial cells, accompanied by the release of various chemotactic, pro-adhesion, and procoagulant cytokines from these cells. Response gene to complement (RGC)-32, an essential effector of the terminal complement complex C5b-9, also affects atherogenesis, propelling vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, stimulating endothelial proliferation, and promoting vascular lesion formation. A substantial amount of experimental work has suggested a role for the complement system activation during atherosclerotic plaque formation, with the proximal classical complement pathway seemingly having a protective effect and terminal complement contributing to accelerated atherogenesis.

Though describing most anions reasonably well, the lack of mechanistic basis and the poor performance for cations constrain the usage of this model. 2) The polyparameter linear free energy relationship (pp-LFER) model performs worse (RMSE = 1.26/1.12 for anions/cations). The different physicochemical environments, due to different sorption depths into the membrane of the different species, cannot be described with a single pp-LFER model. 3) COSMOmic is based on quantum chemistry and fluid phase thermodynamics and has the widest applicability domain.

An in-depth study of the reaction parameters highlights the use of dimethyl carbonate as a preferred polymerization solvent and outlines the structure-property relationship for hypervalent iodide carboxylates and halide initiators in both the free radical and iodine degenerative transfer controlled radical polymerization (IDT-CRP) of VDF. Finally, the rational selection of metal carbonyls that are successful not only as IDT mediators but, more importantly, in the quantitative activation of both PVDF-CH2-CF2-I and PVDF-CF2-CH2-I chain ends toward the synthesis of well-defined PVDF block copolymers is presented. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","Atom transfer radical polymerization; Block copolymers; Carbonylation; Carboxylation; Chains; Copolymerization; Fluorine compounds; Free radicals; Iodine; Metal halides; Polymerization; Transition metals; Block copolymerization; Controlled radical polymerization; Degenerative transfer; Fluorinated monomers; Photoactive transitions; Photochemical method; Polymerization solvents; Structure property relationships; Free radical polymerization"

The usage of iron to synthesize consumer products and to remediate environment is an attractive approach. This perspective presents applications of the high-valent iron oxo compound FeVIO42- (ferrate) in sustainable organic synthesis and treatment technology. In synthesizing organic molecules, C-H bond activation and selectivity are two basic ingredients of efficiency, which are attainable by ferrate. Examples of hydroxylation of hydrocarbons and conversion of alcohols to aldehyde/ketone are presented. In addition, many other organic molecules of amines, aniline, phenolic, and thiol functionalities can be oxidized by ferrate. This oxidation chemistry of ferrate is expedient in transforming pharmaceuticals, micropollutants in bodies of water with implications for human and ecological health. A wide range of micropollutants, which are commonly found in drinking water resources and wastewater effluents, can be efficiently oxidized by ferrate on a seconds to minutes time scale. These molecules include endocrine disruptors, antibiotics, β-blockers, antidepressants, X-ray contrast media, and cosmetic products. The reaction pathways of transformation of the studied pharmaceuticals are discussed. The results of the evaluation of toxicity of the oxidized products are given. The reduced product of ferrate is the environmentally friendly and magnetic iron(III) oxide.

The major groups of these proteins include the ATP-binding cassette transporters which in eukaryotes work as ATP-fuelled drug exporters and the Solute Carrier transporters, with various transport directions and mechanisms.Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the key ATP-binding cassette and Solute Carrier drug transporters which have been reported to contribute to the function and/or protection of undifferentiated human stem cells and during tissue differentiation. We review the various techniques for studying transporter expression and function in stem cells, and the role of drug transporters in foetal and placental tissues is also discussed. We especially focus on the regulation of transporter expression by factors modulating cell differentiation properties and on the function of the transporters in adjustment to environmental challenges.Expert opinion: The relatively new and as yet unexplored territory of transporters in stem cell biology may rapidly expand and bring important new information regarding the metabolic and epigenetic regulation of stemness and the early differentiation properties.

It posses significant medicinal importance along with its age-old traditional uses, especially podophyllotoxin, for its cytotoxic and antiviral activity. Here we reviewed the basic structure of lignans and its variability along with history and the recent reconstruction of podophyllotoxin biosynthetic pathway from pluviatolide to (-)-4-desmethylepipodophyllotoxin.

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are representatives of PFASs. Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) set the health advisory level as 70 parts per trillion for lifetime exposure to PFOS and PFOA from drinking water, based on the EPA’s 2016 Health Effects Support Documents. Then, a monograph on PFOA was made available online by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, where the agency classified PFOA as “possibly carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2B). The distinction between PFOS and PFOA, however, may not be easily understood from the above documents. This paper discussed differential toxicity between PFOS and PFOA focusing on neurotoxicity, developmental toxicity and carcinogenicity, mainly based on these documents. The conclusions are as follows: Further mechanistic studies may be necessary for ultrasonic-induced PFOS-specific neurotoxicity. To support the hypothesis for PFOS-specific neonatal death that PFOS interacts directly with components of natural lung surfactant, in vivo studies to relate the physicochemical effects to lung collapse may be required. PFOA-induced DNA damage secondary to oxidative stress may develop to mutagenicity under the condition where PFOA-induced apoptosis is not sufficient to remove the damaged cells. A study to find whether PFOA induces apoptosis in normal human cells may contribute to assessment of human carcinogenicity. Studies for new targets such as hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) may help clarify the underlying mechanism for PFOA-induced carcinogenicity. © 2016, Japanese Society of Toxicology.

To understand the response of macrophages, they are often cultured in vitro on biomaterials. Since a wide range of biomaterials is currently used in the clinics, we undertook a systematic review of the macrophage polarization in response to these different surgical biomaterials in vitro. Beside the chemistry, material characteristics such as dimension, pore size, and surface topography are of great influence on the response of macrophages. The macrophage response also appears to depend on the differences in sterilization techniques that induce lasting biochemical changes or residues of chemicals and their byproducts used for sterilization. Regarding tissue-based biomaterials, macrophages on human or porcine dermis, strongly cross-linked by chemicals elicit in general a proinflammatory response with higher amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. Synthetic biomaterials such as polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) + polyacrylamide (PAAm), PET + sodium salt of poly(acrylic acid) (PAANa), perfluoropolyether (PFPE) with large posts, PEG-g-PA, and polydioxanone (PDO) always appear to elicit an anti-inflammatory response in macrophages, irrespective of origin of the macrophages, for example, buffy coats or full blood. In conclusion, in general in vitro models contribute to evaluate the foreign body reaction on surgical biomaterials. Although it is difficult to simulate complexity of host response elicited by biomaterials, after their surgical implantation, an in vitro model gives indications of the initial foreign body response and allows the comparison of this response between biomaterials. © Geesien S.A.

Commercial applications include their use as phthalocyanine dyes in optical discs, porphyrins in photodynamic therapy, and as oxygen sensors. Most applications of these dyes require exocyclic moieties to improve solubility, target diseases, modulate photophysical properties, or direct the self-organization into architectures with desired photonic properties. The synthesis of the porphyrinoid depends on the desired application, but the de novo synthesis often involves several steps, is time consuming, and results in low isolated yields. Thus, the application of core porphyrinoid platforms that can be rapidly and efficiently modified to evaluate new molecular architectures allows researchers to focus on the design concepts rather than the synthesis methods, and opens porphyrinoid chemistry to a broader scientific community. We have focused on several widely available, commercially viable porphyrinoids as platforms: meso-perfluorophenylporphyrin, perfluorophthalocyanine, and meso-perfluorophenylcorrole. The perfluorophenylporphyrin is readily converted to the chlorin, bacteriochlorin, and isobacteriochlorin. Derivatives of all six of these core platforms can be efficiently and controllably made via mild nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions using primary S, N, and O nucleophiles bearing a wide variety of functional groups. The remaining fluoro groups enhance the photo and oxidative stability of the dyes and can serve as spectroscopic signatures to characterize the compounds or in imaging applications using 19F NMR.

The examples chosen focus on data acquired in situ/operando, under realistic operating conditions and during activation which often allow for obtaining a more relevant perspective on the changes in catalyst structure that accompany a change in catalyst performance.

Although preeclampsia is a subject of many research projects, the etiology of the condition remains unclear. One of the hypotheses related to the etiology of preeclampsia is the deficiency in placental 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11β-HSD2), the enzyme which in normal pregnancy protects the fetus from the excess of maternal cortisol. The reduced activity of the enzyme was observed in placentas from pregnancies complicated with preeclampsia. That suggests the overexposure of the developing child to maternal cortisol, which in high levels exerts proapoptotic effects and reduces fetal growth. The fetal growth restriction due to the diminished placental 11β-HSD2 function may be supported by the fact that preeclampsia is often accompanied with fetal hypotrophy. The causes of the reduced function of 11β-HSD2 in placental tissue are still discussed.

Trophic magnification factor and BMF values greater than 1.0 are often considered to be the most conclusive indicators of B status, and the TMF criterion has been referred to as the ""gold standard"" for B categorization. Although not wishing to dispute the theoretical primacy of field-derived BMFs and TMFs as B metrics, we make the case that, in practice, the study-to-study (and even within-study) variability of the results is so great that they are of very restricted usefulness for assessing B status, at least in the case of the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), on which we focus here. This conclusion is based on an analysis of the results of 24 peer-reviewed studies reporting field-derived BMFs or TMFs for 14 PFASs, for which BMF values often range over several orders of magnitude from ≪1.0 to ≫1.0, sometimes even in the same study. For TMFs, the range is a factor of approximately 20 for the most intensely studied PFASs (perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA] and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid [PFOS]). We analyze the possible causes for such variability: To some extent it results from the differing ways in which the metrics are expressed, but most of the scatter is likely attributable to such factors as nonachievement of the tacitly assumed steady-state conditions, uncertainties in the feeding ecology, the impact of metabolism of precursor compounds, and so forth. As more trustworthy alternatives to field-derived BMFs and TMFs, we suggest the implementation of dietary BMF studies performed under strictly controlled conditions on aquatic, terrestrial, and avian species, as well as the consideration of measured elimination half-lives, which have been demonstrated to be directly related to BMF values. © 2015 The Author.","alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; water pollutant; analysis; animal; environmental monitoring; food chain; procedures; risk assessment; water pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Caprylates; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Food Chain; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Dairy products and specific oils like coconut oil are natural sources of dietary C8:0 but higher intakes of this fatty acid can be provided with MCT (Medium-Chain Triglycerides) oil that consists in 75% of C8:0. MCFAs have physical and metabolic properties that are distinct from those of long-chain saturated fatty acids (LCFAs ≥12 carbons). Beneficial physiological effects of dietary C8:0 have been studied for a long time and MCT oil has been used as a special energy source for patients suffering from pancreatic insufficiency, impaired lymphatic chylomicron transport and fat malabsorption. More recently, caprylic acid was also shown to acylate ghrelin, the only known peptide hormone with an orexigenic effect. Through its covalent binding to the ghrelin peptide, caprylic acid exhibits an emerging and specific role in modulating physiological functions themselves regulated by octanoylated ghrelin. Dietary caprylic acid is therefore now suspected to provide the ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) enzyme with octanoyl-CoA co-substrates necessary for the acyl modification of ghrelin. This review tries to highlight the discrepancy between the formerly described beneficial effects of dietary MCFAs on body weight loss and the C8:0 newly reported effect on appetite stimulation via ghrelin octanoylation. The subsequent aim of this review is to demonstrate the relevance of carrying out further studies to better understand the physiological functions of this particular fatty acid. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).","ghrelin; medium chain fatty acid; octanoic acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; acyltransferase; chylomicron; fat intake; ghrelin; ghrelin O-acyltransferase, human; octanoic acid; octanoic acid derivative; acylation; antibacterial activity; antiviral activity; appetite; bioavailability; biosynthesis; chemical reaction; fat intake; fatty acid metabolism; hormone synthesis; lipid storage; nonhuman; octanoylation; Review; weight reduction; animal; fat intake; human; lipoylation; metabolism; pancreas exocrine insufficiency; pharmacology; Acylation; Acyltransferases; Animals; Caprylates; Chylomicrons; Dietary Fats; Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency; Ghrelin; Humans; Lipoylation"

At some point, the majority of sunscreens will find their way into wastewater (due to bathing and washing activities) and because wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not able to remove and/or degrade them, consequently they find their way into rivers, lakes and ocean, so it is not surprising that UV-filters are found in the environment.

It is unknown whether the size of a developing fetus affects maternal GFR such that a small fetus leads to reduced plasma volume expansion (PVE), reduced GFR and subsequent higher concentrations of biomarkers in maternal serum. Our objective was to answer the question: ""Is there an association between fetal growth and maternal GFR in humans?""Methods: We adapted and applied the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology to assess the evidence of an association between fetal growth and GFR, either directly or indirectly via reduction in PVE.Results: We identified 35 relevant studies.

For many years during this timeframe, 19F imaging research continued at a slow pace as the various attributes of the technique were explored. However, over the last decade and particularly the last several years, the pace and clinical relevance of 19F imaging has exploded. In part, this is due to advances in MRI instrumentation, 19F/1H coil designs, and ultrafast pulse sequence development for both preclinical and clinical scanners. These achievements, coupled with interest in the molecular imaging of anatomy and physiology, and combined with a cadre of innovative agents, have brought the concept of 19F into early clinical evaluation.

Many studies have highlighted outcomes and assessed their potential advantages, but much of the data on adverse outcomes are limited and often based on outdated technology. We aimed to review and summarize the available literature on insulin pump-associated adverse events in adults and children. Methods: A literature search was undertaken using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library. Articles were then screened by title, followed by abstract, and full text as needed. A by-hand search of reference lists in identified papers was also utilised. All searches were limited to English language material, but no time limits were used. Results: Current and past literature regarding insulin pump-associated adverse events is discussed, including potential metabolic and non-metabolic adverse events, in particular: pump malfunction; infusion set/site issues; and cutaneous problems. We show that even with modern technology, adverse events are common, occurring in over 40 % of users per year, with a minority, particularly in children, requiring hospital management. Hyperglycaemia and ketosis are now the most common consequences of adverse events and are usually associated with infusion set failure. This differs from older technology where infected infusion sites predominated. Conclusions: This timely review covers all potential insulin pump-associated adverse events, including their incidence, features, impacts, and contributory factors such as the pump user. The importance of ongoing anticipatory education and support for patients and families using this intensive insulin technology is highlighted, which if done well should improve the overall experience of pump therapy for users, and hopefully reduce the incidence and impact of severe adverse events. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Italia.","insulin; insulin aspart; insulin derivative; insulin glulisine; insulin lispro; recombinant human insulin; short acting insulin; antidiabetic agent; insulin; catheter dislocation; catheter occlusion; clinical feature; clinical trial (topic); convulsion; device failure; device infection; diabetes mellitus; diabetic ketoacidosis; drug delivery system; drug hypersensitivity; erythema; heart arrest; heart fibrillation; hospital management; human; hyperglycemia; hyperkalemia; hypoglycemia; incidence; indwelling catheter; insulin pump; ketoacidosis; lipoatrophy; lipohypertrophy; medical technology; metabolic disorder; patient education; precipitation; priority journal; pump malfunction; Review; risk reduction; scar formation; skin disease; skin infection; skin irritation; skin manifestation; skin nodule; social psychology; unspecified side effect; adult; adverse effects; child; complication; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; insulin infusion; meta analysis; Adult; Child; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incidence; Insulin; Insulin Infusion Systems"

Although the obesity epidemic is largely fueled by poor nutrition and lack of exercise, certain chemicals have been shown to potentially have a role in its aetiology. A substantial body of evidence suggests that a subclass of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which interfere with endocrine signalling, can disrupt hormonally regulated metabolic processes, especially if exposure occurs during early development. These chemicals, so-called 'obesogens' might predispose some individuals to gain weight despite their efforts to limit caloric intake and increase levels of physical activity. This Review discusses the role of EDCs in the obesity epidemic, the latest research on the obesogen concept, epidemiological and experimental findings on obesogens, and their modes of action.

The implementation of on-line SPE made possible the effective development of faster methods by reducing the analysis time and thus increasing the analytical productivity. The on-line SPE method are particularly suitable in studies where only limited sample material is available, as the sample volume can be as low as 1. mL. Most of the multiresidual methods have been developed using wettable and polar embedded reverse phases, sometimes sequentially packed with weak ionic exchangers in order to widen the polarity range of the adsorbents.

In this review, we analyzed the available data on the catalytic systems containing rhodium halides and redox co-catalysts and their implementation to oxidation of methane and other lower alkanes. Based on experimental data and DFT results, we suggest possible mechanisms for oxidative functionalization of methane and propane. Activation of methane may get started with formation of a σ-complex with Rh. Activation of dioxygen takes place at the activated species of redox co-catalysts - iodine, copper or iron compounds - and leads to formation of two-electron oxidants. The redox co-catalysts may also interact with Rh. The activation of dioxygen is favored by the presence of added reducing agent (CO) which returns oxidized redox co-catalysts to their reduced form. The necessity of preliminary dioxygen reduction brings about analogy with biocatalysts for oxidation of alkanes. The oxidative carbonylation of methane to acetic acid most likely proceeds via an intermediate with the CH3-Rh bond. The formation of alcohols and acetone is consistent with formation of intermediate complexes containing the Rh-OI and Rh-O-O-Cu fragments. The esterification of alcohols with ingressed perfluorocarboxylic acids prevents from deep oxidation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Acetone; Carbon monoxide; Carbonylation; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Chemical activation; Copper compounds; Iron compounds; Methane; Oxidation; Paraffins; Quantum chemistry; Redox reactions; Rhodium; Dioxygens; Functionalizations; Oxidation of methane; Oxidative carbonylation; Oxidative functionalization; Perfluorocarboxylic acid; Quantum chemical calculations; Two-electron oxidants; Rhodium compounds"

Early endosomes represent a major cargo of dynein in filamentous fungi, and dynein regulators such as LIS1 and the dynactin complex are both required for early endosome movement. In fungal hyphae, kinesin-3 and dynein drive bi-directional movements of early endosomes. Dynein accumulates at microtubule plus ends; this accumulation depends on kinesin-1 and dynactin, and it is important for early endosome movements towards the microtubule minus ends.

FtsZ is indirectly anchored to the membrane and it is prevented from polymerizing at locations where septation is undesired. Several properties of FtsZ are mediated by other proteins that function as keepers of the ring. ZipA and FtsA serve to anchor the ring, and together with a set of Zap proteins, they stabilize it. The MinCDE and SlmA proteins prevent the polymerization of FtsZ at sites other than the midcell. Finally, ClpP degrades FtsZ, an action prevented by ZipA.

Although most of the filaments assemble on their own to form higher order structures, growing evidence suggests that there are a number of prokaryotic proteins that polymerise only in the presence of a matrix such as DNA, lipid membrane or even another filament. Matrix-assisted filament systems are frequently nucleotide dependent and cytomotive but rarely considered as part of the bacterial cytoskeleton. Here, we categorise this family of filament-forming systems as collaborative filaments and introduce a simple nomenclature. Collaborative filaments are frequent in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes and are involved in vital cellular processes including chromosome segregation, DNA repair and maintenance, gene silencing and cytokinesis to mention a few. In this review, we highlight common principles underlying collaborative filaments and correlate these with known functions. Bacterial protein filaments can assemble on their own as part of the cytoskeleton, or alternatively may require an scaffolding matrix. The latter, now called collaborative filaments, are conserved and are known to be involved in critical cellular functions, such as cell division. © 2015 The Authors.","collaborative protein filament; cytoskeleton protein; Dan filament; DivIVA protein; DNA; dynamin; FtsA protein; FtsZ protein; MinCD protein; RecA protein; unclassified drug; bacterial DNA; bacterial protein; cytoskeleton protein; cell division; cell wall; chromosome segregation; cytokinesis; cytoskeleton; DNA repair; eukaryote; gene silencing; lipid membrane; nomenclature; nonhuman; priority journal; prokaryote; protein family; protein function; Review; bacterium; genetics; human; metabolism; physiology; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Cell Division; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Cytoskeleton; DNA Repair; DNA, Bacterial; Gene Silencing; Humans"

Our strategy involves the derivatization of target analytes with perfluoroalkyl reagents, followed by selective retention of the derivatives with a perfluoroalkyl-modified stationary phase LC column. The perfluoroalkylated derivatives are strongly retained on the column owing to their fluorophilicity, whereas non-derivatized species, such as sample matrices, are hardly retained. Therefore, utilizing this derivatization method, target analytes can be determined selectively without interference from matrices.

Biochar can remove organic contaminants in water, such as some pesticides (0.02-23mgg-1), pharmaceutical and personal care products (0.001-59mgg-1), dyes (2-104mgg-1), humic acid (60mgg-1), perfluorooctane sulfonate (164mgg-1), and N-nitrosomodimethylamine (3mgg-1).

Structural analysis of four of these seemingly unrelated proteins revealed the recurrent use of a conserved beta-sandwich fold that has not been observed in any eukaryotic or prokaryotic protein. Herein we propose to call this unique structural scaffolding the PIE (Poxvirus Immune Evasion) domain. PIE domain containing proteins are abundant in chordopoxvirinae, with our analysis identifying 20 likely PIE subfamilies among 33 representative genomes spanning 7 genera. For example, cowpox strain Brighton Red appears to encode 10 different PIEs: vCCI, A41, C8, M2, T4 (CPVX203), and the SECRET proteins CrmB, CrmD, SCP-1, SCP-2, and SCP-3. Characterized PIE proteins all appear to be nonessential for virus replication, and all contain signal peptides for targeting to the secretory pathway. The PIE subfamilies differ primarily in the number, size, and location of structural embellishments to the beta-sandwich core that confer unique functional specificities. Reported ligands include chemokines, GM-CSF, IL-2, MHC class I, and glycosaminoglycans. We expect that the list of ligands and receptors engaged by the PIE domain will grow as we come to better understand how this versatile structural architecture can be tailored to manipulate host responses to infection. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","binding protein; protein binding; viral protein; binding affinity; bioinformatics; calcium transport; cell migration; conservation genetics; immune evasion; immune response; immunogenicity; microbial diversity; nonhuman; poxvirus immune evasion; protein expression; protein structure; Review; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; structural proteomics; structure analysis; chemistry; genetics; immunology; physiology; Poxviridae; protein tertiary structure; Immune Evasion; Poxviridae; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Viral Proteins"

Infections of the lower female genital tract (FGT) frequently are asymptomatic; thus, they often remain undiagnosed or untreated. If infections are either not resolved or left untreated, chlamydia can ascend to the upper FGT and infect the fallopian tubes (FTs) causing salpingitis that may lead to functional damage of the FTs and tubal factor infertility (TFI). Clinical observations and experimental data have indicated a role for antibodies against C. trachomatis proteins such as the 60-kDa heat shock protein 60 (cHSP60) in the immunopathogenesis of TFI. When released from infected cells, cHSP60 can induce proinflammatory immune responses that may functionally impair the FTs leading to fibrosis and luminal occlusion. Chlamydial pathogenesis of irreversible and permanent tubal damage is a consequence of innate and adaptive host immune responses to ongoing or repeated infections. The extracellular matrix that is regulated by metalloproteinases may also be modified by chlamydial infections of the FGT. This review will highlight protective and pathogenic immune responses to ongoing and repeated chlamydial infections of the FGT.

Some of the Au(iii) complexes reported, show unusually easy reductive elimination reactions of trifluoromethylated products which could be applied in the development of gold-catalyzed processes for the trifluoromethylation of organic compounds. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Gold; Synthesis (chemical); Oxidation state; Oxidative additions; Reductive elimination reaction; Singular characteristics; Synthetic methods; Transmetallation; Trifluoromethyl; Trifluoromethylation; Gold compounds"

Mercury accumulation in the environment has been a topic of continuing concern because of its extreme toxicity and its biomagnification through food webs resulting in increased human exposure. The toxicity of this element depends upon its chemical form: its organic form (methyl mercury MeHg (I)) being more toxic than its inorganic form (Hg (II)). Mercury, when released from most sources is deposited into sediments and soils where it may be converted to MeHg (I). Measuring concentrations of Hg species in sediments is important as sediments are considered as the sink for Hg and the main site of MeHg (I) production, eventually leading to bioaccumulation and biomagnification of Hg through food webs.This review summarises the published literature of procedures used to extract Hg from sediments and soils and the use of HPLC to separate and quantify Hg species and presents a synthesis of the strengths and limitations of analytical protocols used for extraction and HPLC-ICPMS separation and measurement of Hg species. Sediments should be freeze dried before extraction to preserve Hg species and ensure complete extraction. The extraction protocols belong to three categories: acid-base extraction, water distillation or organic solvents and sulfhydryl containing reagents. Acid or alkali extractions using microwave assisted heating or sonication gave higher MeHg (I) recoveries (80-120%) from sediments and sediment certified reference materials compared to the extractions using organic solvents or thiol containing reagents which gave MeHg (I) recoveries of 58-106%. Distillation using water, with and without additives also gave good extraction recoveries (87-108%), but suffers from MeHg (I) artefact formation. For the separation of Hg species extracted from sediment samples the majority of studies used reverse phase chromatography with either C8 or C18 columns with a mobile phase containing a thiol reagent such as cysteine, 2-mercaptoethanol or sodium pyrrolidine dithio carbamate. When chromatography is performed it is important that MeHg (I) elutes before Hg (II), as MeHg (I) concentrations in sediments are very low compared to the Hg (II) concentrations and peak tailing due to very high Hg (II) concentrations will not allow the quantification of MeHg (I) concentrations.Based on these studies we recommend extraction of Hg species using distillation or 2-mercaptoethanol. HPLC with the use of a C8 column and 2-mercaptoethanol in the mobile phase that elutes of MeHg (I) before Hg (II). The use of enriched Hg isotope allows corrections for MeHg (I) artefact formation and incomplete Hg extraction. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",

Recent findings The BTB divides the seminiferous epithelium into the basal and the adluminal compartments. The BTB is constituted by coexisting actin-based tight junction, basal ectoplasmic specialization, and gap junction, and also intermediate filament-based desmosome between Sertoli cells near the basement membrane. Junctions at the BTB undergo continuous remodeling to facilitate the transport of preleptotene spermatocytes residing in the basal compartment across the immunological barrier during spermatogenesis. Thus, meiosis I/II and postmeiotic spermatid development take place in the adluminal compartment behind the BTB. BTB remodeling also regulates exchanges of biomolecules between the two compartments. As tight junction, basal ectoplasmic specialization, and gap junction use F-actin for attachment, actin microfilaments rapidly convert between their bundled and unbundled/branched configuration to confer BTB plasticity. The events of actin reorganization are regulated by two major classes of ABPs that convert actin microfilaments between their bundled and branched/unbundled configuration. Summary We provide a model on how ABPs regulate BTB remodeling, shedding new light on unexplained male infertility, such as environmental toxicant-induced reproductive dysfunction since the testis, in particular the BTB, is sensitive to environmental toxicants, such as cadmium, bisphenol A, phthalates, and PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid or perfluorooctane sulfonate).

The objectives of the workshop were to: 1. Review findings related to the role of environmental chemicals, referred to as ""metabolic disruptors"", in obesity and metabolic syndrome with special attention to recent discoveries from animal model and epidemiology studies; 2. Identify conclusions that could be drawn with confidence from existing animal and human data; 3. Develop predictions based on current data; and 4. Identify critical knowledge gaps and areas of uncertainty. The consensus statements are intended to aid in expanding understanding of the role of metabolic disruptors in the obesity and metabolic disease epidemics, to move the field forward by assessing the current state of the science and to identify research needs on the role of environmental chemical exposures in these diseases.

Under normal physiological conditions, angiogenesis is well balanced and controlled by endogenous proangiogenic factors and antiangiogenic factors. However, factors produced by cancer cells, cancer stem cells and other cell types in the tumor stroma can disrupt the balance so that the tumor microenvironment favors tumor angiogenesis. These factors include vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial tissue factor and other membrane bound receptors that mediate multiple intracellular signaling pathways that contribute to tumor angiogenesis. Though environmental exposures to certain chemicals have been found to initiate and promote tumor development, the role of these exposures (particularly to low doses of multiple substances), is largely unknown in relation to tumor angiogenesis. This review summarizes the evidence of the role of environmental chemical bioactivity and exposure in tumor angiogenesis and carcinogenesis. We identify a number of ubiquitous (prototypical) chemicals with disruptive potential that may warrant further investigation given their selectivity for high-throughput screening assay targets associated with proangiogenic pathways. We also consider the cross-hallmark relationships of a number of important angiogenic pathway targets with other cancer hallmarks and we make recommendations for future research. Understanding of the role of low-dose exposure of chemicals with disruptive potential could help us refine our approach to cancer risk assessment, and may ultimately aid in preventing cancer by reducing or eliminating exposures to synergistic mixtures of chemicals with carcinogenic potential. © The Author 2015.

Inhalational exposure to metal-containing fumes generated by welding and related processes may result in the development of the clinical syndrome known as ""metal fume fever."" Polymer fume fever is a separate and distinct but related disorder that has been associated with inhalational exposure to specific fluorinated polymer products, such as polytetrafluoroethylene or Teflon®. We undertook a review of the peer-reviewed medical literature as it relates to these two disease entities in order to describe their epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and prognosis. Methodology. We performed a search of the PubMed (www.pubmed.com) and Ovid MEDLINE (ovidsp.tx.ovid.com) databases for keywords ""metal fume fever,"" ""polymer fume fever,"" and ""fume fever,"" covering the period 1946 to September 2014, which resulted in a total of 141 citations. Limiting the search to articles published in the English language yielded 115 citations. These 115 articles were manually reviewed for relevance. In addition, the reference lists in each article retrieved were reviewed for additional relevant references. This left 48 relevant citations. Epidemiology. Metal fume fever occurs most commonly as an occupational disease in individuals who perform welding and other metal-joining activities for a living. It is estimated that 1,5002,500 cases of metal fume fever occur annually in the United States. Polymer fume fever was initially identified as an occupational disease but increased regulations have resulted in decreased incidence in the occupational setting. Overheating of Teflon®-coated cookware is one of the more common mechanisms for exposure. Pathophysiology. While the precise pathophysiology associated with the development of metal fume fever is yet to be elucidated, suggested pathophysiologic mechanisms include pro-inflammatory cytokine release, neutrophil activation, and oxygen radical formation. The pathophysiologic mechanism for polymer fume fever has not been definitively elucidated but may involve similar mechanisms to those proposed for metal fume fever. Clinical presentation. Metal fume fever typically presents with generally non-specific complaints including influenza-like symptoms, fever, shaking chills, arthalgias, myalgias, headache, and malaise. Onset of symptoms typically occurs 410 h following the exposure to metal-containing fumes. While metal fume fever is typically benign and self-limited, severe cases of the disease have been reported. In patients with ongoing metal fume exposure over the course of a workweek, tachyphylaxis occurs resulting in improvement in symptoms over the course of the workweek and maximal symptoms occurring after an exposure-free period such as a weekend. The clinical presentation of polymer fume fever is indistinguishable from metal fume fever, with an exposure history being necessary to distinguish the two entities. Diagnosis. Chest radiographs are typically normal in cases of metal fume fever and polymer fume fever; however, mild vascular congestion may be demonstrated and severe cases may feature diffuse patchy infiltrates. Laboratory studies are typically not necessary but may demonstrate leukocytosis with leftward shift or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Treatment. The primary treatment for both metal fume fever and polymer fume fever is supportive and directed at symptom relief. Oral hydration, rest, and the use of antipyretics and anti-inflammatory medications (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin) are recommended. A careful workplace exposure assessment analysis conducted by an occupational medicine specialist or clinical toxicologist in concert with a qualified industrial hygienist should be performed. Prevention. A careful workplace exposure assessment including measurement of ambient zinc and other metal (e.g., chrome, nickel, copper and manganese) fume concentrations or concentrations of fluorocarbon polymer decomposition products at different locations within the workplace should be performed.

There is growing evidence that several of these chemical compounds interfere with human development in various ways. The aim of this review is to provide an update on the relationship between various persistent organic pollutants and childhood neurodevelopmental outcome from studies from the past 10 years. This review focuses on exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and in addition on exposure to phthalates, bisphenol A, and perfluorinated compounds and their associations with neurodevelopmental outcome in childhood, up to 18 years of age. This review shows that exposure to environmental chemicals affects neurodevelopmental outcome in children. Regarding exposure to PCBs and OH-PCBs, most studies report no or inverse associations with neurodevelopmental outcomes. Regarding exposure to PBDEs, lower mental development, psychomotor development and IQ were found at preschool age, and poorer attention at school age. Regarding exposure to DDE, most studies reported inverse associations with outcome, while others found no associations. Significant relations were particularly found at early infancy on psychomotor development, on attention and ADHD, whereas at school age, no adverse relationships were described. Additionally, several studies report gender-related vulnerability. Future research should focus on the long-term effects of prenatal and childhood exposure to these environmental chemicals, on sex-specific and combined exposure effects of environmental chemicals, and on possible mechanisms by which these chemicals have their effects on neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzhydryl derivative; diphenyl ether derivative; phenol derivative; phthalic acid derivative; pollutant; polychlorinated biphenyl; adolescent; animal; chemically induced; child; female; human; infant; mental disease; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; newborn; pollutant; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; preschool child; toxicity; Adolescent; Animals; Benzhydryl Compounds; Child; Child, Preschool; Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Phenols; Phthalic Acids; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"

Since Ras signalling is abnormally activated in more than 30% of human cancers, Ras and its downstream signalling pathways are considered good targets for therapeutic interference. Ras is post-translationally modified by the addition of a farnesyl group, which permits its attachment to the plasma membrane. Exploiting this knowledge, a synthetic Ras inhibitor, S-trans, trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS; Salirasib), was developed. FTS resembles the farnesylcysteine group of Ras, and acts as an effective Ras antagonist. In the present review, the effect of FTS in combination with various other drugs, as tested in vitro and in vivo, and its therapeutic potential are discussed. As reviewed, FTS cooperates with diverse therapeutic agents, which significantly improves treatment outcome.

There are vast applications of hydrophobic membranes such as filtration, gas separation, membrane gas absorption, pervaporation, membrane distillation and more that cannot be attained with hydrophilic membranes. However, the development of hydrophobic membranes was relatively slow in the past, as membrane technologists and researchers were more interested in reducing membrane hydrophobicity for permeability enhancement or fouling control in the aqueous separation. Thus, literature related to hydrophobic membranes has not been reviewed elsewhere. This review reported on the characterization and preparation methods for hydrophobic membranes. Hydrophobic ceramic membranes are commonly prepared by chemical modification. Besides using different types of chemicals, the membrane surface is roughened to enhance its hydrophobicity. For polymeric membranes, great hydrophobicity can be engineered using per-fluorinated polymers or phase immersion in a dual coagulation bath. Each technique has its advantages and weaknesses.

In particular, in all vanadium flow battery systems (VRB), perfluorinated polymers such as Nafion® are widely used, owing to their high proton conductivity and chemical stability; however, the extremely high cost of currently available membranes has limited the commercialization of VRB technology. Recently, low-cost porous polymeric composite separators (e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]/silica), as an alternative to traditional ion-exchange membranes, have attracted a great deal of interest because of their significantly lower cost. Porous separators prepared from various polymer materials and inorganic fillers have demonstrated comparable electrochemical performances to that of Nafion® in flow battery tests with different redox chemistries.

While diet appears the principal source for the majority of western populations (with other pathways like dust ingestion, drinking water and inhalation also important contributors); the role played by exposure to PFOS-precursor compounds followed by in vivo metabolism to PFOS as the ultimate highly stable end-product is unclear. Such PFOS-precursor compounds include perfluorooctane sulfonamide derivates, e.g., perfluorooctane sulfonamides (FOSAs) and sulfonamidoethanols (FOSEs). Understanding the indirect contribution of such precursors to human body burdens of PFOS is important as a significant contribution from this pathway would render the margin of safety between the current exposure limits and estimates of external exposure to PFOS alone, narrower than hitherto appreciated. Estimates derived from mathematical modelling studies, put the contribution of so-called ""precursor exposure"" at between 10% and 40% of total PFOS body burdens. However, there are substantial uncertainties associated with such approaches.

In the past five years, due to the development of new perfluoroalkylation reagents and methodologies, significant progress has been made in the field of transition-metal-mediated perfluoroalkylation. Compared with perfluoroalkylation, di- and monofluoroalkylation can not only introduce fluorine atom(s) into a molecule, but also install a non-fluorinated moiety simultaneously; therefore, in organic synthesis, these reactions are of higher step economy than the direct fluorination reactions. Although analogous to transition-metal-mediated perfluoroalkylations, the di- and monofluoroalkylation have been relatively less developed; therefore, there are still many opportunities for their development. In this review, we have made a survey on transition- metal-mediated di- and monofluoroalkylation reactions that were published in the past nearly 30 years. To our knowledge, this is the first rather comprehensive review on this topic. This review is divided into five sections. The first section is the general introduction on di- and monofluoroalkylation. The second and third sections focus on the historical development of transition-metal-mediated di- and monofluoroalkylation with reagents that contain functional groups. These two sections are subdivided according to the reactions types, that is, fluoroalkylation of unsaturated organohalides, fluoroalkylation of the carbon-hydrogen bonds of unsaturated systems (arenes, alkenes, alkynes, and carbonyl compounds), fluoroalkylation of organoborane reagents and organometallic reagents, fluoroalkyl addition to unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds.

Since the 1990s, the aluminum industry has made considerable progress in reducing PFCs from conventionally defined and detected AEs. However in recent years, the industry has noted the presence of unaccounted PFCs that are generated outside the conventional AE definition. Two additional AE categories have been proposed, namely low-voltage, propagating AEs (LVP-AEs) and nonpropagating AEs (NP-AEs) that relate to continuous, background levels of PFC emissions. These unaccounted PFC phenomena may help explain the recent discrepancy between industry accounting and atmospheric measurements of global PFC emissions. Estimates from AGAGE, a global network of atmospheric observatories, suggest as much as 50% underaccounting of PFCs by the aluminum industry in the 2006–2010 period. The following work reviews this discrepancy and the potential role played by LVP-AEs and NP-AEs. © 2015, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","Aluminum plants; Electrodes; Greenhouse gases; Ore reduction; Aluminum industry; Aluminum reduction cells; Anode effects; Atmospheric measurement; Background level; Carbon compounds; Global networks; Low voltages; Aluminum"

Utilizing this unique property, we have developed a fluorous derivatization with a liquid chromatographic analysis method for highly selective analysis of target analytes. Although most previous methods focused on extremely sensitive detection-oriented derivatization, the fluorous derivatization method involves highly specific separation for analytes. This method includes perfluoroalkylation of analytes with a fluorous reagent, and separation of the derivatives using a perfluoroalkyl-modified stationary phase LC column. The derivatives can be selectively retained on the fluorous-phase LC column, whereas the non-fluorous derivatives are poorly retained under the same separation conditions. The combination of this method with LC-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is very useful for complex biological sample analysis, because matrix-induced suppression effects, which are a common problem in LC-MS/MS analysis arising from components of a biological endogenous matrix, have not been observed. We have successfully applied this method to precise and accurate LC-MS/MS analysis of some biogenic com- pounds, such as sialic acids and biogenic amines, in complex biological samples. © 2015 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.","biogenic amine; sialic acid; fluorescent dye; derivatization; liquid chromatography; perfluoroalkylation; Review; tandem mass spectrometry; chemistry; human; oral drug administration; publication; vaccination; Administration, Oral; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Periodicals as Topic; Vaccination"

More recently, many of the molecular mechanisms underlying the multiple effects of TH on proliferation, differentiation, migration, synaptogenesis and myelination in the developing nervous system have been elucidated. At the same time data from both epidemiological studies and animal models have revealed that the influence of thyroid signaling on development of the nervous system, extends to all periods of life, from early embryogenesis to neurogenesis in the adult brain. This review focuses on recent insights into the actions of TH during early neurogenesis. A key concept is that, in contrast to the previous ideas that only the unliganded receptor was implicated in these early phases, a critical role of the ligand, T3, is increasingly recognized. These findings are considered in the light of increasing knowledge of cell specific control of T3 availability as a function of deiodinase activity and transporter expression. These requirements for TH in the early stages of neurogenesis take on new relevance given the increasing epidemiological data on adverse effects of TH lack in early pregnancy on children's neurodevelopmental outcome. These ideas lead logically into a discussion on how the actions of TH during the first phases of neurogenesis can be potentially disrupted by gestational iodine lack and/or chemical pollution.

PFASs are a broad class of man-made substances that have been produced and used in both commercial products and industrial processes for more than 60 years. Although the production and use of some PFASs has been phased-out in some parts of the world, it is not known what effect these actions to date have had on PFAS concentrations in the environment. Owing to the wide diversity of PFASs, it is difficult to generalize their properties, environmental fate and production histories. However, the strength and stability of the C-F bond renders the perfluoroalkyl moieties resistant to heat and environmental degradation. Several PFASs are now occurring even in very remote areas in large parts of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of substances within this group is not well understood. A systematic review may be able to determine whether the concentrations of these substances in different environments are changing in any particular direction with time, and whether the phase-outs have had any effects on the concentration trends. Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations in the environment will be performed in the scientific literature as well as in other reports. Relevant samples include both abiotic and biological samples including humans. No particular time, document type, language or geographical constraints will be applied. Two authors will screen all retrieved articles. Double screening of about 10% of the articles will be performed by all authors at both title/abstract and full-text levels. Kappa tests will be used to test if the screening is consistent. Relevant articles will be critically appraised by four authors (double checking of 25% of the articles). Quality assessment will focus on selection bias, dating of samples, sample integrity and analytical procedures.

This paper examines proposals for reproductive health activities under humanitarian health and protection funding mechanisms for 2002-2013, and the level at which these reproductive health proposals were funded. Methods: The study used English and French health and protection proposal data for 2002-2013, extracted from the Financial Tracking Service (FTS) database managed by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Every project was reviewed for relevance against pre-determined reproductive health definitions for 2002-2008. An in-depth analysis was additionally conducted for 2009-2013 through systematically reviewing proposals via a key word search and subsequently classifying them under designated reproductive health categories. Among the relevant reproductive health proposals, counts and proportions were calculated in Excel based on their reproductive health components, primarily by year. Contributions, requests, and unfunded requests were calculated based on the data provided by FTS. Results: Among the 11,347 health and protection proposals issued from 345 emergencies between 2002 and 2013, 3,912 were relevant to reproductive health (34.5%). The number of proposals containing reproductive health activities increased by an average of 21.9% per year, while the proportion of health and protection sector appeals containing reproductive health activities increased by an average of 10.1% per year. The total funding request over the 12 years amounted to $4.720 billion USD, of which $2.031 billion USD was received. Among reproductive health components for 2009-2013 proposals, maternal newborn health comprised the largest proportion (56.4%), followed by reproductive health-related gender-based violence (45.9%), HIV/sexually transmitted infections (37.5%), general reproductive health (26.2%), and lastly, family planning (14.9%). Conclusion: Findings show that more agencies are responding to humanitarian appeals by proposing to implement reproductive health programs and receiving increased aid over the twelve year period. While such developments are welcome, project descriptions show comparatively limited attention and programming for family planning and abortion care in particular. © 2015 Tanabe et al.",

Human epidemiological studies are sparse. The aim was to investigate the association between pregnancy serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and offspring behaviour and motor development at 5-9 years of age. Methods: Maternal sera from the INUENDO cohort (2002-2004) comprising 1,106 mother-child pairs from Greenland, Kharkiv (Ukraine) and Warsaw (Poland) were analysed for PFOS and PFOA, using liquid-chromatographytandem- mass-spectrometry. Exposures were grouped into country specific as well as pooled tertiles as well as being used as continuous variables for statistical analyses. Child motor development and behaviour at follow-up (2010-2012) were measured by the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire 2007 (DCDQ) and Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), respectively. Exposure-outcome associations were analysed by multiple logistic and linear regression analyses. Results: In the pooled analysis, odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) for hyperactivity was 3.1 (1.3, 7.2) comparing children prenatally exposed to the highest PFOA tertile with those exposed to the lowest PFOA tertile. Comparing children in the highest PFOS tertile with those in the lowest PFOS tertile showed elevated but statistically non-significant OR of hyperactivity (OR (95% CI) 1.7 (0.9, 3.2)). In Greenland, elevated PFOS was associated with higher SDQ-total scores indicating more behavioural problems (β (95% CI) =1.0 (0.1, 2.0)) and elevated PFOA was associated with higher hyperactivity sub-scale scores indicating more hyperactive behaviour (β (95% CI) = 0.5 (0.1, 0.9)). Prenatal PFOS and PFOA exposures were not associated with motor difficulties. Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to PFOS and PFOA may have a small to moderate effect on children's neuro-behavioural development, specifically in terms of hyperactive behaviour. The associations were strongest in Greenland where exposure contrast is largest. © 2015 Høyer et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","perfluorinated alkyl substance; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; age class; behavioral response; child development; cohort analysis; concentration (composition); mental health; organofluorine; pollution effect; pollution exposure; pregnancy; serum; spatiotemporal analysis; adult; blood analysis; child; child behavior; child development; cohort analysis; concentration (parameters); Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire; female; follow up; gestational age; Greenland; human; hyperactivity; infant; liquid chromatography; male; maternal blood; motor development; motor dysfunction; nervous system development; outcome assessment; prenatal exposure; priority journal; progeny; prospective study; questionnaire; Review; Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire; tandem mass spectrometry; adverse effects; blood; chemically induced; drug effects; epidemiology; maternal exposure; motor activity; Poland; pregnancy; preschool child; Ukraine; Arctic; Charkov; Greenland; Mazowieckie; Poland [Central Europe]; Ukraine; Warsaw [Mazowieckie]; Animalia; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Chromatography, Liquid; Female; Fluorocarbons; Greenland; Humans; Male; Maternal Exposure; Motor Activity; Poland; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Prospective Studies; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Ukraine"

The selected articles reported quantitative methods to determine DNA methylation including immunocolorimetric assays for total content of genomic DNA methylation, and microarray technologies, methylation-specific quantitative PCR, Luminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA), and bisulfite pyrosequencing for DNA methylation content of genomic sites such as gene promoters, LINE-1, Alu elements, and others. Considering consistency, temporality, strength, dose-response relationship, and biological plausibility, we concluded that the current evidence is not sufficient to provide inference because differences across studies and limited samples sizes make it difficult to compare across studies and to evaluate sources of heterogeneity.

The major function of CD59 is to protect cells from complement attack. CD59 binds to complement components C8 and C9 and prevents the polymerization of C9, which is required for the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). Other functions of CD59 in cellular immunity are less well defined. CD59 is inserted into the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. A defect of this anchor causes lack of this protein from the cell membrane, which leads to an enhanced sensitivity towards complement attack. Patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) harbor a varying percentage of red blood cell clones with a defect in GPI-anchored proteins, including CD59. The most characteristic symptoms of this disease are episodes of hemolysis and thromboses. Although CD59 has been classified as a membrane protein for more than 25 years, an alloantibody directed against CD59 was found only recently. So far, the first and sole alloantibody described was detected in a CD59-deficient child. In 2014, CD59 received the status of a blood group system by the International Society for Blood Transfusion Red Cell Immunogenetics and Blood Group Terminology Working Party. Among a variety of almost 20 synonyms, the designation CD59 was chosen for the blood group system and CD59.1 for the wild-type protein. The only three alleles published to date are null alleles. All CD59-deficient individuals recognized so far were severely ill, two of whom have died. Most of the reported cases present with a typical clinical picture within the first year of life that includes neuropathy, strokes, and mild Coombs-negative hemolysis. In one published case, the application of the complement inhibitor eculizumab caused a pronounced improvement of the clinical situation.","alloantibody; CD59 antigen; complement inhibitor; eculizumab; glycosylphosphatidylinositol; blood group antigen; CD59 antigen; complement inhibitor; lymphocyte antibody; 5' untranslated region; alternative RNA splicing; blood group system; carboxy terminal sequence; cellular immunity; human; molecular weight; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; null allele; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; phenotype; polymerization; priority journal; Review; X ray crystallography; chemistry; immunology; biochemical analysis; history of medicine; inheritance; nomenclature; Antigens, CD59; Blood Group Antigens; Complement Inactivating Agents; Humans"

First conceptualised in 2001, much progress has been made to make wastewater analysis (WWA) a reliable and robust tool for measuring chemical consumption and/or exposure. At the moment, the most popular application of WWA, sometimes referred as sewage epidemiology, is to monitor the consumption of illicit drugs in communities around the globe, including China. The approach has been largely adopted by law enforcement agencies as a device to monitor the temporal and geographical patterns of drug consumption. In the future, the methodology can be extended to other chemicals including biomarkers of population health (e.g. environmental or oxidative stress biomarkers, lifestyle indicators or medications that are taken by different demographic groups) and pollutants that people are exposed to (e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, perfluorinated chemicals, and toxic pesticides). The extension of WWA to a huge range of chemicals may give rise to a field called sewage chemical-information mining (SCIM) with unexplored potentials. China has many densely populated cities with thousands of sewage treatment plants which are favourable for applying WWA/SCIM in order to help relevant authorities gather information about illicit drug consumption and population health status. However, there are some prerequisites and uncertainties of the methodology that should be addressed for SCIM to reach its full potential in China. © 2014 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Aromatic hydrocarbons; Biomarkers; Catchments; Chemicals; Health; Indicators (chemical); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Sewage treatment plants; Drug consumption; Geographical patterns; Innovative approaches; Law-enforcement agencies; Oxidative stress biomarkers; Perfluorinated chemicals; Population health; Wastewater analysis; Chemical analysis; biomarker; chemical analysis; drug; public health; wastewater; China; street drug; waste water; water pollutant; analysis; China; environmental monitoring; human; waste water; water pollutant; China; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Street Drugs; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Data are presented on ISEs with membranes based on perfluorocompounds, which are especially important for the medical and biological applications. Studies are briefly described where instead of the replacement of PVC with self-plasticized polymers, the low-molecular plasticizers are replaced with polymeric analogs, retaining PVC as the polymeric matrix.

However, data on the basic physicochemical properties of PFASs are scarce. To fill part of the data gaps, improved quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models for prediction of PFAS properties are developed based on the correlation between reported experimental data and molecular descriptors (fluorine number, molar volume and total surface area). Properties include vapor pressure, aqueous solubility, octanol/water partition coefficient, air/water partition coefficient and octanol/air partition coefficient. The fluorine number-descriptor model is based on good statistical results. However, this model cannot distinguish among PFASs with the same number of attached fluorines. Setting aside the fluorine number-descriptor models, models based on molar volume are statistically better than those based on total surface area. Therefore, The PFAS data obtained from the molar volume descriptor model are more reliable than from fluorine number and total surface area descriptor models.

The most commonly studied PFASs are perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Animal studies indicate that maternal PFAS exposure is associated with reduced fetal growth. However, the results of human studies are inconsistent. Objectives: To summarize the evidence of an association between exposure to PFASs, particularly PFOS and PFOA, and human fetal growth. Methods: Systematic literature searches were performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE. We included original studies on pregnant women with measurements of PFOA or PFOS in maternal blood during pregnancy or the umbilical cord and associations with birth weight or related outcomes according to the PFAS level. Citations and references from the included articles were investigated to locate more relevant articles. Study characteristics and results were extracted to structured tables. The completeness of reporting as well as the risk of bias and confounding were assessed. Results: Fourteen studies were eligible. In utero PFOA exposure was associated with decreased measures of continuous birth weight in all studies, even though the magnitude of the association differed and many results were statistically insignificant. PFOS exposure and birth weight were associated in some studies, while others found no association. Conclusions: Higher PFOS and PFOA concentrations were associated with decreased average birth weight in most studies, but only some results were statistically significant. The impact on public health is unclear, but the global exposure to PFASs warrants further investigation. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pollutant; birth weight; cord serum; environmental exposure; fetus growth; gestational age; human; low birth weight; maternal blood; outcome assessment; pregnant woman; Review; small for date infant; umbilical cord; adverse effects; animal; drug effects; female; fetus development; pollutant; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; toxicity; Animalia; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Birth Weight; Caprylates; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fetal Development; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome"

NRs orchestrate complex events such as development, organ homeostasis, metabolism, immune function, and reproduction. Approximately one-half of the 48 human NRs have been shown to act as ligand-regulated transcription factors and respond directly to a large variety of endogenous hormones and metabolites that are generally hydrophobic and small in size (eg, retinoic acid or estradiol). The second half of the NR family comprises the so-called orphan receptors, for which regulatory ligands are still unknown or may not exist despite the presence of a C-terminal ligand-binding domain, which is the hallmark of all NRs. Several chemicals released into the environment (eg, bisphenols, phthalates, parabens, etc) share some physicochemical properties with natural ligands, allowing them to bind to NRs and activate or inhibit their action. Collectively referred to as endocrine disruptors or endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), these environmental pollutants are highly suspected to cause a wide range of developmental, reproductive, neurological, or metabolic defects in humans and wildlife. Crystallographic studies are revealing unanticipated mechanisms by which chemically diverse EDCs interact with the ligand-binding domain of NRs. These studies thereby provide a rational basis for designing novel chemicals with lower impacts on human and animal health. In this review, we provide a structural and mechanistic view of endocrine disrupting action using estrogen receptors and β, (ER/β), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and their respective environmental ligands as representative examples. © 2015 CPS and SIMM.","4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; 4 tert octylphenol; benzophenone; cell nucleus receptor; chlordecone; endocrine disruptor; estrogen receptor alpha; estrogen receptor beta; genistein; ligand; magnolol; organotin compound; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; phthalic acid; phthalic acid benzyl butyl ester; resveratrol; retinoic acid; rosiglitazone; tetrabromobisphenol A; transcription factor; animal health; binding affinity; chemical structure; crystal structure; crystallography; drug targeting; human; ligand binding; metabolite; nonhuman; physical chemistry; pollutant; protein domain; receptor binding; Review; screening; wildlife"

The number of studies in literature describing their worldwide presence in several environmental matrices is growing, and many of them indicate that the techniques employed for their safe removal tend to be ineffective.

Since fronts are associated with convergent currents and productive fishing grounds, any possible convergence of pollutants at fronts would raise concerns. The focus here is on relatively persistent organic pollutants, POPs, as non-persistent organic pollutants are rarely found in the open ocean. Results from recent cruises in the Atlantic Ocean are examined for POP distributions across ocean fronts in (i) the Canary Current; (ii) the Gulf Stream; and (iii) the Amazon and Rio de la Plata Plumes. Few studies achieved a spatial resolution of 10-20. km, while most had 100-300. km between adjacent stations. The majority of the well-resolved studies measured perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), which seem particularly well suited for frontal resolution. In the NE Atlantic, concentrations of PFCs sharply decreased between SW Europe and NW Africa upon crossing the Canary Current Front at 24-27°N. In the Western Atlantic, the PFC concentrations sharply increased upon entering the Amazon River Plume and Rio de la Plata Plume. In the NW Atlantic, concentrations of several pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are very high in Rhode Island Sound, decreasing to below detection limit in the open ocean. The more persistent and already phased-out polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) displayed elevated concentrations in the Gulf Stream and Rhode Island Sound, thereby highlighting the importance of ocean fronts, along-front currents, and cross-frontal transport for the dispersal of PCBs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Ocean currents; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; River pollution; Atlantic Ocean; Detection limits; Elevated concentrations; Perfluorinated compound (PFCs); Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Spatial resolution; Western Atlantic; Organic pollutants; concentration (composition); oceanic front; organic pollutant; PCB; pollutant transport; river plume; spatial distribution; Amazon River; Atlantic Ocean; Canary Current; Gulf Stream; Rio de la Plata"

Nowhere is this more evident than in chloroplasts - the O2-evolving photosynthetic organelles of plant cells that are fitted with multiple redox systems, including the thioredoxin (Trx) family of oxidoreductases functional in the reversible modification of regulatory thiols of proteins in all types of cells. The best understood member of this family in chloroplasts is the ferredoxin-linked thioredoxin system (FTS) by which proteins are modified via light-dependent disulfide/dithiol (S-S/2SH) transitions. Recent Advances: Discovered in the reductive activation of enzymes of the Calvin-Benson cycle in illuminated chloroplast preparations, recent studies have extended the role of the FTS far beyond its original boundaries to include a spectrum of cellular processes. Together with the NADP-linked thioredoxin reductase C-type (NTRC) and glutathione/glutaredoxin systems, the FTS also plays a central role in the response of chloroplasts to different types of stress. Critical Issues: The comparisons of redox regulatory networks functional in chloroplasts of land plants with those of cyanobacteria - prokaryotes considered to be the ancestors of chloroplasts - and different types of algae summarized in this review have provided new insight into the evolutionary development of redox regulation, starting with the simplest O2-evolving organisms. Future Directions: The evolutionary appearance, mode of action, and specificity of the redox regulatory systems functional in chloroplasts, as well as the types of redox modification operating under diverse environmental conditions stand out as areas for future study. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.","alteplase; carbon dioxide; cysteine; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; glutaredoxin; glutathione; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; phosphoribulokinase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; rubisco activase; thiol; thioredoxin; thioredoxin reductase; unclassified drug; ferredoxin; thioredoxin; chloroplast; cyanobacterium; Embryophyta; enzyme activation; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidation reduction reaction; photosynthesis; plant evolution; Review; chloroplast; classification; genetics; metabolism; molecular evolution; oxidation reduction reaction; plant; Chloroplasts; Evolution, Molecular; Ferredoxins; Oxidation-Reduction; Plants; Thioredoxins"

Adsorption not only is an effective technology to remove PFCs from water or wastewater, but also affects PFC distribution at solid-liquid interfaces and their fate in aquatic environments. This article reviews the adsorption behavior of different PFCs (mainly perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoate) on various adsorptive materials. Some effective adsorbents are introduced in detail in terms of their preparation, characteristics, effects of solution chemistry and PFC properties on adsorption. Adsorption mechanisms of PFCs on different adsorbents are summarized, and various interactions including electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interaction, ligand exchange, and hydrogen bond are fully reviewed. The adsorbents with amine groups generally have high adsorption capacity for PFCs, and formation of micelles/hemi-micelles plays an important role in achieving high adsorption capacity of perfluorinated surfactants on some porous adsorbents. Hydrophobic interaction is mainly responsible for PFC adsorption, but the difference between PFCs and traditional hydrocarbons has not clearly clarified.

The first assumes that partitioning to membrane phospholipids, which have a higher affinity for charged species than neutral storage lipids, can explain the high bioaccumulation potential of these compounds. The second assumes that interactions with proteins-including serum albumin, liver fatty acid binding proteins (L-FABP), and organic anion transporters-determine the distribution, accumulation and half-lives of PFAAs. We consider three unique phenomena to evaluate the two models: (1) observed patterns of tissue distribution in the laboratory and field, (2) the relationship between perfluorinated chain length and bioaccumulation, and (3) species- and gender-specific variation in elimination half-lives. Through investigation of these three characteristics of PFAA bioaccumulation, we show the strengths and weaknesses of the two modeling approaches. We conclude that the models need not be mutually exclusive, but that protein interactions are needed to explain some important features of PFAA bioaccumulation. Although open questions remain, further research should include perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) beyond the long-chain PFAAs, as these substances are being phased out and replaced by a wide variety of PFASs with largely unknown properties and bioaccumulation behavior. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","Biochemistry; Phospholipids; Proteins; Bioaccumulation potential; Charged species; Fatty acid-binding proteins; Important features; Membrane phospholipids; Perfluorinated alkyl substances; Protein interaction; Tissue distributions; Bioaccumulation; fatty acid; fatty acid binding protein; liver fatty acid binding protein; organic anion transporter; perfluorinated alkyl acid; perfluoro compound; protein; serum albumin; unclassified drug; bioaccumulation; hypothesis testing; numerical model; organic acid; phospholipid; protein; animal experiment; animal tissue; beluga whale; bioaccumulation; brain; cartilage; female; muscle; nonhuman; protein interaction; rainbow trout; rat; review; small intestine; stomach; tissue distribution; Animals; Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins; Fluorocarbons; Half-Life; Humans; Models, Biological; Serum Albumin; Tissue Distribution"

PFASs have been detected globally in the aquatic environment including drinking water at trace concentrations and due, in part, to their persistence in human tissue some are being investigated for regulation. They are aliphatic compounds containing saturated carbon-fluorine bonds and are resistant to chemical, physical, and biological degradation. Functional groups, carbon chain length, and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity are some of the important structural properties of PFASs that affect their fate during drinking water treatment. Full-scale drinking water treatment plant occurrence data indicate that PFASs, if present in raw water, are not substantially removed by most drinking water treatment processes including coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, biofiltration, oxidation (chlorination, ozonation, AOPs), UV irradiation, and low pressure membranes. Early observations suggest that activated carbon adsorption, ion exchange, and high pressure membrane filtration may be effective in controlling these contaminants.

The removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals under different conditions in the wetlands were evaluated at the macroscopic level. In addition, the importance of the three main components of constructed wetlands (substrate, plants and microbes) for pharmaceutical removal was analyzed to elucidate the possible removal mechanisms involved.

For Staphylococcus aureus, recurring infections and a limited success of vaccines containing S. aureus antigens imply that native antigens induce immune responses insufficient for optimal efficacy. These perspectives exemplify the need to apply novel vaccine strategies to high-priority pathogens. One such approach can be termed convergent immunity, where antigens from non-target organisms that contain epitope homologs found in the target organism are applied in vaccines. This approach aims to evoke atypical immune defenses via synergistic processes that (1) afford protective efficacy; (2) target an epitope from one organism that contributes to protective immunity against another; (3) cross-protect against multiple pathogens occupying a common anatomic or immunological niche; and/or (4) overcome immune subversion or avoidance strategies of target pathogens. Thus, convergent immunity has a potential to promote protective efficacy not usually elicited by native antigens from a target pathogen. Variations of this concept have been mainstays in the history of viral and bacterial vaccine development. A more far-reaching example is the pre-clinical evidence that specific fungal antigens can induce cross-kingdom protection against bacterial pathogens. This trans-kingdom protection has been demonstrated in pre-clinical studies of the recombinant Candida albicans agglutinin-like sequence 3 protein (rAls3) where it was shown that a vaccine containing rAls3 provides homologous protection against C. albicans, heterologous protection against several other Candida species, and convergent protection against several strains of S. aureus. Convergent immunity reflects an intriguing new approach to designing and developing vaccine antigens and is considered here in the context of vaccines to target S. aureus. © 2014 Yeaman, Filler, Schmidt, Ibrahim, Edwards and Hennessey.","alpha hemolysin; alpha toxin; aphylococcus enterotoxin B; bacterial antigen; bacterial vaccine; collagen binding protein; complement component C3b; complement component C5a; complement component C5b; complement component C8; diphtheria toxoid CRM197; epitope; fungus antigen; gsk2392; Human immunodeficiency virus vaccine; live vaccine; Panton Valentine leukocidin; Pneumococcus vaccine; recombinant antigen; recombinant protein; Sa3ag; Sa4ag; Staphylococcus vaccine; stebvax; toxoid; unclassified drug; vaccine; virus vaccine; antigen recognition; bacteremia; bacterial colonization; Candida albicans; Clostridium tetani; convergent immunity; Corynebacterium diphtheriae; cross protection; hemodialysis; host resistance; human; humoral immunity; immunity; immunoregulation; immunotherapy; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; microbiome; Murinae; neutrophil; nonhuman; opportunistic infection; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); protein expression; protein processing; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; recurrent disease; regulatory T lymphocyte; Respiratory syncytial pneumovirus; Review; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus infection; vaccination"

Biogas (primarily containing methane and CO2), which is generated from waste biomass via anaerobic digestion or landfills, is regarded as a renewable source of methane, and has the potential to achieve sustainable production of transportation fuels. Since biogas also contains a significant amount of impurities (e.g., H2S, NH3, and siloxane), a cleaning procedure is generally required prior to conversion to transportation fuels. Physical approaches, mainly compression and liquefaction, have been commercially applied to upgrade biogas to bio-compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied biogas (LBG). For chemical approaches, catalytic reforming is the dominant method for converting methane to syngas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) or fermentation of syngas to a variety of alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, and butanol) and liquid hydrocarbon fuels (e.g., gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels). High purity hydrogen, a clean fuel, can also be produced via reforming. Methanol can be produced by direct oxidation of methane, while interest in the biological conversion of methane to methanol has grown recently due to its mild operating conditions, high conversion efficiency, and potential for using raw biogas. The derived methanol can be further converted to gasoline via a methanol to gasoline (MTG) process. This paper provides a comprehensive review of major research progress on technologies for converting biogas/methane into transportation fuels, and discusses the principles, kinetics, operating conditions, and performance of each technology. Efficient direct conversion of biogas into ethanol and higher alcohol fuels (e.g. butanol), which is envisaged to be the focus of research pursuits in the near future, is also discussed, with emphasis on the development of methane-utilizing microbes through genetic engineering. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Complement factors are produced in adipose tissue and appear to be involved in adipose tissue metabolism and local inflammation. Thereby complement links adipose tissue inflammation to systemic metabolic derangements, such as low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. Furthermore, complement has been implicated in pathophysiological mechanisms of diet- and alcohol induced liver damage, hyperglycaemia, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis and fibrinolysis.In this review, we summarize current evidence on the role of the complement system in several processes of human cardiometabolic disease. C3 is the central component in complement activation, and has most widely been studied in humans. C3 concentrations are associated with insulin resistance, liver dysfunction, risk of the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and CVD. C3 can be activated by the classical, the lectin and the alternative pathway of complement activation; and downstream activation of C3 activates the terminal pathway. Complement may also be activated via extrinsic proteases of the coagulation, fibrinolysis and the kinin systems. Studies on the different complement activation pathways in human cardiometabolic disease are limited, but available evidence suggests that they may have distinct roles in processes underlying cardiometabolic disease. The lectin pathway appeared beneficial in some studies on type 2 diabetes and CVD, while factors of the classical and the alternative pathway were related to unfavourable cardiometabolic traits. The terminal complement pathway was also implicated in insulin resistance and liver disease, and appears to have a prominent role in acute and advanced CVD.The available human data suggest a complex and potentially causal role for the complement system in human cardiometabolic disease. Further, preferably longitudinal studies are needed to disentangle which aspects of the complement system and complement activation affect the different processes in human cardiometabolic disease. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; antilipemic agent; antioxidant; complement component C1q; complement component C1r; complement component C1s; complement component C2; complement component C3; complement component C3a; complement component C5; complement component C5a; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement factor H; complement receptor; high density lipoprotein; kinin; lectin; selenium; vitronectin; adipose tissue; cardiometabolic risk; cardiovascular disease; complement activation; complement system; fatty liver; fibrinolysis; human; inflammation; insulin resistance; lifestyle; liver disease; liver dysfunction; metabolic disorder; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; priority journal; review; Cardiovascular disease; Complement system; Diabetes; Fatty liver disease; Insulin resistance; Obesity; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; Complement System Proteins; Humans; Inflammation; Insulin Resistance; Metabolic Diseases"

They are still considered rare and even of less clinical importance. This not only reflects (as in all PIDs) a great lack of awareness among clinicians and general practitioners but is also due to the fact that only few centers worldwide provide a comprehensive laboratory complement analysis. To enable early identification, our aim is to present warning signs for complement deficiencies and recommendations for diagnostic approach. The genetic deficiency of any early component of the classical pathway (C1q, C1r/s, C2, C4) is often associated with autoimmune diseases whereas individuals, deficient of properdin or of the terminal pathway components (C5 to C9), are highly susceptible to meningococcal disease. Deficiency of C1 Inhibitor (hereditary angioedema, HAE) results in episodic angioedema, which in a considerable number of patients with identical symptoms also occurs in factor XII mutations. New clinical entities are now reported indicating disease association with partial complement defects or even certain polymorphisms (factor H, MBL, MASPs). Mutations affecting the regulators factor H, factor I, or CD46 and of C3 and factor B leading to severe dysregulation of the alternative pathway have been associated with renal disorders, such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and - less frequent - with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). We suggest a multi-stage diagnostic protocol starting based on the recognition of so called warning signs which should aid pediatricians and adult physicians in a timely identification followed by a step-wise complement analysis to characterize the defect at functional, protein and molecular level. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","alternative complement pathway C3 C5 convertase; CD11b antigen; CD59 antigen; complement; complement component C1q; complement component C1r; complement component C2; complement component C4; complement component C4 binding protein; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement factor H; decay accelerating factor; fibrinogen; mannose binding lectin; membrane cofactor protein; properdin; thrombomodulin; angioneurotic edema; autoimmune disease; bacterial infection; complement deficiency; epidemic meningitis; gene mutation; glomerulopathy; hemolytic uremic syndrome; human; immune deficiency; membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; meningococcosis; priority journal; retina macula age related degeneration; review; Complement analysis; Complement deficiencies; Infections; Meningitis; Prevalence; Warning signs; Complement System Proteins; Humans; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; Prevalence"

It is a first hormone linking gastrointestinal-pituitary axis. Objective: This review highlights the interaction of ghrelin with GHRH and somatostatin to regulate the secretion of GH and intends to explore the possible physiological role of the ghrelin-pituitary-GH axis linkage system. Observation: Ghrelin is highly conserved among species and is classified into octanoylated (C8:0), decanoylated (C10:0), decenoylated (C10:1) and nonacylated,ghrelin. Acylated ghrelin is the major active form of human ghrelin. The primary production site of ghrelin is the stomach, and it interacts with stomach ghrelin as well as hypothalamic GHRH and somatostatin in the regulation of pituitary GH secretion. Ghrelin stimulate GH release through the GHS receptor to increase intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+] levels via IP3 signal transduction pathway. Ghrelin is a specific endogenous ligand for the GHS receptor and provides a definitive proof of the occurance of a GHS-GHS receptor signalling system in the regulation of GH secretion. Conclusion: Studies suggests that ghrelin is a powerful pharmacological agent that exerts a potent, time-dependent stimulation of pulsatile secretion of GH.","acyltransferase; adenosine triphosphate; cyclic AMP; des glutamine 14 ghrelin; diacylglycerol; ghrelin; ghrelin o acyl transferase; ghrelin receptor; growth hormone; growth hormone releasing factor; growth hormone releasing peptide; growth hormone secretagogue; inositol trisphosphate; messenger RNA; n octanoylated ghrelin; peptide; phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 bisphosphate; protein c fos; somatomedin C; somatostatin; unclassified drug; drug efficacy; gene; ghrelin gene; growth hormone release; hormonal regulation; hormone action; hormone binding; human; hypophysis; hypothalamus; nonhuman; peptide synthesis; protein expression; protein structure; regulatory mechanism; review; signal transduction"

Nevertheless, as many biodegradation studies were performed without the intention to discriminate between metabolic and cometabolic processes, the specific contribution of the latter to substance transformations is often not clarified. This minireview summarizes current knowledge about the cometabolic degradation of organic trace pollutants by activated sludge and sludge-inherent microorganisms. Due to their relevance for communal wastewater contamination, the focus is laid on pharmaceuticals, personal care products, antibiotics, estrogens, and nonylphenols. Wherever possible, reference is made to the molecular process level, i.e., cometabolic pathways, involved enzymes, and formed transformation products.

As a result of this accumulation and partitioning, a breastfeeding infant's intake of these LPECs may be much greater than his/her mother's average daily exposure. Because the developmental period sets the stage for lifelong health, it is important to be able to accurately assess chemical exposures in early life. In many cases, current human health risk assessment methods do not account for differences between maternal and infant exposures to LPECs or for lifestage-specific effects of exposure to these chemicals. Because of their persistence and accumulation in body lipids and partitioning into breast milk, LPECs present unique challenges for each component of the human health risk assessment process, including hazard identification, dose-response assessment, and exposure assessment. Specific biological modeling approaches are available to support both dose-response and exposure assessment for lactational exposures to LPECs. Yet, lack of data limits the application of these approaches.

These agents serve close retinal breaks, confine eventual retinal redetachment, and prevent proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Long-acting gases and silicone oil are effective internal tamponade agents; however, because their specific gravity is lower than that of the vitreous fluid, they may provide adequate support for the superior retina but lack efficacy for the inferior retina, especially when the fill is subtotal. Thus, a specific role may exist for an internal tamponade agent with a higher specific gravity, such as heavy silicone oils (HSOs), Densiron 68, Oxane HD, HWS 45-300, HWS 46-3000, and HeavySil.

In this review, we discuss the fundamental clinical and biochemical/molecular mechanisms involved in the inflammatory response after the use of heavy tamponade: toxicity due to impurities or instability of the agent, direct toxicity and immunogenicity, oil emulsification, and mechanical injury due to gravity.

Since its introduction, and until December 2013, about 700 papers have been published using the QuEChERS technique, according to a literature overview carried out using SciFinder, Elsevier SciVerse, and Google search engines. Most of these papers were dedicated to pesticide multiresidue analysis in food matrices, and this topic has been thoroughly reviewed over recent years. The QuEChERS approach is now rapidly developing beyond its original field of application to analytes other than pesticides, and matrices other than food, such as biological fluids and non-edible plants, including Chinese medicinal plants. Recently, the QuEChERS concept has spread to environmental applications by analyzing not only pesticides but also other compounds of environmental concern in soil, sediments, and water. To the best of our knowledge, QuEChERS environmental applications have not been reviewed so far; therefore, in this contribution, after a general discussion on the evolution and changes of the original QuEChERS method, a critical survey of the literature regarding environmental applications of conventional and modified QuEChERS methodology is provided.

Traditionally, blood and urine collection have been widely used as sampling methods. New non-invasive approaches (e.g., saliva, hair, nails) are emerging as valid alternatives since they offer advantages with respect to sampling, handling, and ethical aspects, while ensuring similar reliability and sensitivity. Nevertheless, the identification of biomarkers of exposure is often difficult because chemicals may be metabolized in the human body. For many of the above-mentioned compounds, the mechanisms of the favorable metabolization pathways have not been unraveled, but research on important metabolites that could be used as biomarkers of exposure is growing.

Optimized photochemical elimination methods, which involve the pollutant properties, light adsorption and quantum yield, interfacial interaction and environmental conditions, are promising techniques for controlling the potential risk of HOCs. The present review summarizes the mechanisms of photocatalytic degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) by photo-generated radical species (eg, hVB+, eCB-, ·OH, eaq-) on photocatalyst as well as the mechanisms of direct photolysis. The photochemical degradation of HOCs can be achieved through the electron transfer between HOCs and reactive radical species or photo-induced reduction from the excited state of HOCs. Optimazation designs of photocatalyst and reaction process are important factors for the photocatalytic degradation of HOCs. Based on the currently achieved research results, some key issuses for the future are proposed from some aspects such as the interfacial electron transfer, the information of band structure, and the integration of reaction and separation.",

A wide range of wearable electrochemical sensors and biosensors has been developed for real-time non-invasive monitoring of electrolytes and metabolites in sweat, tears, or saliva as indicators of a wearer's health status. With continued innovation and attention to key challenges, such non-invasive electrochemical sensors and biosensors are expected to open up new exciting avenues in the field of wearable wireless sensing devices and body-sensor networks, and thus find considerable use in a wide range of personal health-care monitoring applications, as well as in sport and military applications. © 2014.","Biosensors; Military applications; Sensor networks; Sensors; Diverse applications; Health status; Low costs; Monitoring applications; Non-invasive monitoring; On-body; Wearable sensors; Wireless sensing; Electrochemical sensors; electrolyte; biosensor; human; lacrimal fluid; metabolite; military medicine; monitoring; non invasive procedure; non invasive wearable electrochemical sensor; priority journal; reliability; review; saliva; sensor; sport; sweat; ambulatory monitoring; chemistry; devices; electrochemical analysis; genetic procedures; procedures; wireless communication; Biosensing Techniques; Electrochemical Techniques; Humans; Monitoring, Ambulatory; Saliva; Sweat; Tears; Wireless Technology"

Development of VW-resistant cultivars remains the only economic option for controlling the disease. The objective of this review was to summarize the progress in screening methods, resistance sources, and genetics, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, markerassisted selection (MAS) and breeding for VW resistance in cotton. Even though Gossypium barbadense L. carries high levels of resistance, its resistance has not been transferred into commercial Upland cultivars. Many Acala cotton cultivars developed in New Mexico and California between the 1940s and the 1990s, and some commercial transgenic cultivars are tolerant or moderately resistant to VW. However, due to difficulties in achieving consistent and uniform inoculation and infection with V. dahliae, both qualitative and quantitative inheritance of VW resistance have been reported in numerous studies for resistant G. barbadense and Upland genotypes. Several QTL analyses have shown the existence of VW resistance QTLs on almost all the tetraploid cotton chromosomes; however, QTLs have most frequently been detected on c5, c7, c8, c11, c16, c17, c19, c21, c23, c24, and c26. This has led to MAS for progeny with favorable QTL alleles for VW resistance in several experiments. Phenotypic selection for VW resistance has been inefficient, while the effectiveness and efficiency of MAS remain to be validated. There is an urgent need for the development of better plant inoculation and screening methods, and for more molecular mapping studies to discern the genetic basis of VW resistance in cotton. © Crop Science Society of America.",

We estimate emissions of 2610-21400 tonnes of C4-C14 PFCAs in the period from 1951 to 2015, and project 20-6420 tonnes to be emitted from 2016 to 2030. The global annual emissions steadily increased in the period 1951-2002, followed by a decrease and then another increase in the period 2002-2012. Releases from fluoropolymer production contributed most to historical PFCA emissions (e.g. 55-83% in 1951-2002). Since 2002, there has been a geographical shift of industrial sources (particularly fluoropolymer production sites) from North America, Europe and Japan to emerging Asian economies, especially China. Sources differ between PFCA homologues, sometimes considerably, and the relative contributions of each source change over time. For example, whereas 98-100% of historical (1951-2002) PFOA emissions are attributed to direct releases during the life-cycle of products containing PFOA as ingredients or impurities, a much higher historical contribution from PFCA precursor degradation is estimated for some other homologues (e.g. 9-78% for PFDA). We address the uncertainties of the PFCA emissions by defining a lower and a higher emission scenario, which differ by approximately a factor of eight. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Fluorine containing polymers; Life cycle; Global emissions; Industrial sources; Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids; PFOA; Polyfluorinated alkyl substances; Carboxylic acids; carbon 14; carboxylic acid; fluorotelomer; perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctane; perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; atmospheric pollution; carboxylic acid; emission inventory; industrial emission; pollutant source; uncertainty analysis; air pollutant; air pollution; carbon footprint; China; environmental impact assessment; Europe; Japan; life cycle; North America; pollution monitoring; priority journal; review; China; Europe; Japan; North America; Geographical shift of industrial sources; Global emission inventory; Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances; Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs); PFOA; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carboxylic Acids; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons"

Human research on this topic has generally focused on single exposure- health effect relationships. The ""exposome"" concept encompasses the totality of exposures from conception onward, complementing the genome. Objectives: The Human Early-Life Exposome (HELIX) project is a new collaborative research project that aims to implement novel exposure assessment and biomarker methods to characterize early-life exposure to multiple environmental factors and associate these with omics biomarkers and child health outcomes, thus characterizing the ""early-life exposome."" Here we describe the general design of the project. Methods: In six existing birth cohort studies in Europe, HELIX will estimate prenatal and postnatal exposure to a broad range of chemical and physical exposures. Exposure models will be developed for the full cohorts totaling 32,000 mother-child pairs, and biomarkers will be measured in a subset of 1,200 mother-child pairs. Nested repeat-sampling panel studies (n = 150) will collect data on biomarker variability, use smartphones to assess mobility and physical activity, and perform personal exposure monitoring. Omics techniques will determine molecular profiles (metabolome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome) associated with exposures. Statistical methods for multiple exposures will provide exposure-response estimates for fetal and child growth, obesity, neurodevelopment, and respiratory outcomes. A health impact assessment exercise will evaluate risks and benefits of combined exposures. Conclusions: HELIX is one of the first attempts to describe the early-life exposome of European populations and unravel its relation to omics markers and health in childhood. As proof of concept, it will form an important first step toward the life-course exposome.","4, 4' isopropylidenediphenol; biological marker; hexachlorobenzene; lead; mercury; nitrogen dioxide; organophosphate pesticide; oxybenzone; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; phthalic acid bis (2 ethylhexyl) ester; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; proteome; tobacco smoke; transcriptome; triclosan; unclassified drug; biological marker; proteome; transcriptome; adult; air pollutant; child; child growth; child health; construction work and architectural phenomena; DNA methylation; environmental exposure; environmental factor; epigenetics; female; fetus growth; food contamination; human; human early life exposure; knowledge; maternal care; metabolome; mobile application; nerve cell differentiation; noise; obesity; physical activity; physical mobility; prenatal exposure; preschool child; priority journal; public health; questionnaire; review; school child; self monitoring; study design; temperature; ultraviolet radiation; water contamination; child development; cohort analysis; environmental exposure; Europe; fetus development; infant; male; newborn; pregnancy; Biological Markers; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Epigenomics; Europe; Female; Fetal Development; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maternal Exposure; Metabolome; Obesity; Pregnancy; Proteome; Transcriptome"

Considerable validation of this technology has been performed at both the bench-scale and pilot-scale, which has been facilitated by the development of stable electrode materials that efficiently generate high yields of hydroxyl radicals (OH) (e.g., boron-doped diamond (BDD), doped-SnO 2, PbO2, and substoichiometic- and doped-TiO2). Although a promising new technology, the mechanisms involved in the oxidation of organic compounds during EAOPs and the corresponding environmental impacts of their use have not been fully addressed. In order to unify the state of knowledge, identify research gaps, and stimulate new research in these areas, this review critically analyses published research pertaining to EAOPs. Specific topics covered in this review include (1) EAOP electrode types, (2) oxidation pathways of select classes of contaminants, (3) rate limitations in applied settings, and (4) long-term sustainability. Key challenges facing EAOP technologies are related to toxic byproduct formation (e.g., ClO 4- and halogenated organic compounds) and low electro-active surface areas.

This contamination comes from domestic sewage, livestock, hospitals and chemical-pharmaceutical industries. Typical examples of these pollutants are the fuoroquinolones - powerful antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine. The presence of fuoroquinolones in the environment can pose a serious threat to the ecosystem and to human health due to their high consumption globally: in 1998, around 120 tons were produced. Even at low environmental concentrations, antibiotics stimulate bacterial resistance. The consequences of the presence of fuoroquinolones in the environment are not fully understood, but are known to be toxic to plants and aquatic organisms. Approximately 85% of the fuoroquinolones present in influents can be removed by conventional wastewater treatment plants, but the removed fraction is frequently accumulated in the sludge, which is sometimes used as fertilizer, representing an additional input route into the environment. The removal of fuoroquinolones by biological treatment is ineffective, and it is believed that only advanced oxidation technologies are able to destroy these emerging pollutants.","quinoline derived antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; aquatic environment; bacterium; bioaccumulation; biodegradation; bioremediation; ecotoxicity; fungus; health hazard; microalga; plant; pollution; pollution transport; review; sediment; sewage; sludge; waste water treatment plant"

This article systematically and critically reviews the epidemiologic evidence regarding the association between PFOA and PFOS exposure and cancer risk in humans. Eighteen epidemiologic studies-eight of PFOA, four of PFOS, and six of both PFOA and PFOS-have estimated associations of exposure to these chemicals with cancer incidence or mortality, with studies equally divided between occupational and nonoccupational settings. Although some statistically significant positive associations have been reported, for example, with cancers of the prostate, kidney, testis, and thyroid, the majority of relative risk estimates for both PFOA and PFOS have been between 0.5 and 2.0 (with 95% confidence intervals including 1.0), inconsistently detected across studies, counterbalanced by negative associations, not indicative of a monotonic exposure-response relationship, and not coherent with toxicological evidence in animals, in which the primary target organs are the liver, testis (Leydig cells), and pancreas (acinar cells). Many positive associations with PFOA exposure were detected in community settings without occupational exposure and were not supported by results in exposed workers.

Identification of the underlying genetic defects is difficult in the majority of cases due to the variable clinical expression of the bleeding symptoms and the redundancy of platelet receptor and signalling pathways, which add to the complexity of diagnosis. The gold standard method for phenotyping platelets, light transmission aggregometry (LTA), has allowed classification of functional defects in the majority of patients referred for investigation of suspected PFDs, while DNA-based analysis has primarily played a confirmatory role and been restricted mainly to analysis of candidate genes. Recent advances in next generation sequencing have facilitated the identification of gene defects in patients with PFDs where the underlying genetic defect was previously unknown, especially when combined with genome-wide linkage analysis. These studies have provided new insights into the mechanisms controlling platelet formation and function, and it is likely that, as understanding of the relationships between platelet phenotype and genotype increases and pipelines for the interpretation of genetic variations identified in patients are developed, DNA-based analysis will play an increasingly important role in the first-line investigation of patients with PFDs. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","analytic method; DNA sequence; gene identification; gene insertion; gene mutation; gene sequence; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic screening; genetic variability; human; light transmission aggregometry; mutational analysis; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; review; single nucleotide polymorphism; thrombocyte disorder; thrombocytopoiesis; bleeding; light transmission aggregometry; next generation sequencing; platelet function disorders; platelets; Blood Platelet Disorders; Blood Platelets; Genetic Testing; Humans; Phenotype"

It has the highest electronegativity of all elements. Fluoride is widely distributed in the environment, occurring in the air, soils, rocks, and water. Although fluoride is used industrially in a fluorine compound, the manufacture of ceramics, pesticides, aerosol propellants, refrigerants, glassware, and Teflon cookware, it is a generally unwanted byproduct of aluminium, fertilizer, and iron ore manufacture. The medicinal use of fluorides for the prevention of dental caries began in January 1945 when community water supplies in Grand Rapids, United States, were fluoridated to a level of 1 ppm as a dental caries prevention measure. However, water fluoridation remains a controversial public health measure. This paper reviews the human health effects of fluoride. The authors conclude that available evidence suggests that fluoride has a potential to cause major adverse human health problems, while having only a modest dental caries prevention effect. As part of efforts to reduce hazardous fluoride ingestion, the practice of artificial water fluoridation should be reconsidered globally, while industrial safety measures need to be tightened in order to reduce unethical discharge of fluoride compounds into the environment.

The key for an integrated representation is through a well-defined force field and Hamiltonian at the molecular level. In developing coarse-grained intermolecular potential functions for the fluid state, one typically starts with a detailed, bottom-up quantum-mechanical or atomic-level description and then integrates out the unwanted degrees of freedom using a variety of techniques; an iterative heuristic simulation procedure is then used to refine the parameters of the model. By contrast, with a top-down technique, one can use an accurate EoS to link the macroscopic properties of the fluid and the force-field parameters. We discuss the latest developments in a top-down representation of fluids, with a particular focus on a group-contribution formulation of the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT-γ). The accurate SAFT-γ EoS is used to estimate the parameters of the Mie force field, which can then be used with confidence in direct molecular simulations to obtain thermodynamic, structural, interfacial, and dynamical properties that are otherwise inaccessible from the EoS.

Although microbiological contamination remains the largest cause of water-related morbidity and mortality globally, chemicals in water supplies may also cause disease, and evidence of the human health consequences is limited or lacking for many of them. Objectives: We aimed to summarize the state of knowledge, identify gaps in understanding, and provide recommendations for epidemiological research relating to chemicals occurring in drinking water. Discussion: Assessing exposure and the health consequences of chemicals in drinking water is challenging. Exposures are typically at low concentrations, measurements in water are frequently insufficient, chemicals are present in mixtures, exposure periods are usually long, multiple exposure routes may be involved, and valid biomarkers reflecting the relevant exposure period are scarce. In addition, the magnitude of the relative risks tends to be small. Conclusions: Research should include well-designed epidemiological studies covering regions with contrasting contaminant levels and sufficient sample size; comprehensive evaluation of contaminant occurrence in combination with bioassays integrating the effect of complex mixtures; sufficient numbers of measurements in water to evaluate geographical and temporal variability; detailed information on personal habits resulting in exposure (e.g., ingestion, showering, swimming, diet); collection of biological samples to measure relevant biomarkers; and advanced statistical models to estimate exposure and relative risks, considering methods to address measurement error. Last, the incorporation of molecular markers of early biological effects and genetic susceptibility is essential to understand the mechanisms of action. There is a particular knowledge gap and need to evaluate human exposure and the risks of a wide range of emerging contaminants.","arsenic; biological marker; disinfectant agent; drinking water; fluoride; manganese; nitrate; perfluorooctanoic acid; trihalomethane; bladder cancer; cancer risk; colorectal cancer; cyanobacterium; epigenetics; exposure; genomics; health; human; metabolomics; practice guideline; priority journal; proteomics; review; toxicity; transcriptomics; waste water; water contamination; water quality; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The cellular and molecular events by which PPARα activators induce rodent hepatocarcinogenesis has been extensively studied and elucidated. This review summarizes the weight of evidence relevant to the hypothesized mode of action (MOA) for PPARα activator-induced rodent hepatocarcinogenesis and identifies gaps in our knowledge of this MOA. Chemical-specific and mechanistic data support concordance of temporal and dose-response relationships for the key events associated with many PPARα activators including a phthalate ester plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and the drug gemfibrozil. While biologically plausible in humans, the hypothesized key events in the rodent MOA, for PPARα activators, are unlikely to induce liver tumors in humans because of toxicodynamic and biological differences in responses. This conclusion is based on minimal or no effects observed on growth pathways, hepatocellular proliferation and liver tumors in humans and/or species (including hamsters, guinea pigs and cynomolgous monkeys) that are more appropriate human surrogates than mice and rats at overlapping dose levels. Overall, the panel concluded that significant quantitative differences in PPARα activator-induced effects related to liver cancer formation exist between rodents and humans. On the basis of these quantitative differences, most of the workgroup felt that the rodent MOA is ""not relevant to humans"" with the remaining members concluding that the MOA is ""unlikely to be relevant to humans"".

It has been evidenced that fuel cells assembled with SSC-PFSA possess higher and more stable performance at elevated temperature up to 130 °C compared to that of fuel cells based on conventional long-side-chain (LSC) PFSA (Nafion®) membranes. Moreover, the shorter side-pendent chains and the absence of the ether group and of the tertiary carbon also endow SSC-PFSAs with better durability, making them more suitable for working at harsh conditions in fuel cell systems. This critical review is dedicated to summarizing the properties of SSC-PFSA and providing insight into an understanding of their micro-morphologies, mass diffusion, enhanced proton transportation and their mutual correlation. Diversified measurement techniques applied to investigate the evolution of micro-morphologies, unique diffusion and transportation properties of SSC-PFSAs are reviewed. Despite the higher crystalline and higher water absorption of SSC-PFSAs than those of LSC-PFSAs, the notably less developed and less interconnected ionic clusters in SSC-PFSAs lead to lower mass permeability, and hence the high water uptake is not as well translated into transportation performance as expected. The factors and reasons for the enhanced electrochemical performance of SSC-PFSAs such as higher proton conductivity at elevated temperatures and low humidity conditions are also discussed and understood. Highlights of recent advances in SSC-PFSA-based membranes for fuel cell applications at wider temperature ranges are summarized as general references for researchers to further prompt the development of SSC-PFSAs.

Bats provide essential ecosystem services and a sustained, thriving population is vital for ecosystem health. Understanding issues threatening their survival is crucial for their protection and conservation. This paper provides the first review for 12. years on organic pollutants in bats and aims to investigate trends and any new issues impacting bat resilience. Organochlorine (OC) pesticides have been reported most often, especially in the older literature, with the dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), present at highest concentrations in tissues analyzed. The OC pesticide concentrations reported in bat tissues have declined significantly since the late 1970s, presumably as a result of restrictions in use. For example, DDE study mean concentrations over time periods 1970-1980, 1981-1999 and 2000-2013 ranged from 2.6-62, 0.05-2.31, 0.08-0.19. ppm wet weight, respectively. Exposure, however, still occurs from remaining residues, many years after the compounds have been actively used. In recent years (2000-2013), a range of other organic chemicals have been reported in bat tissues including brominated flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ether at a mean concentration of 2.9. ppm lipid weight) and perfluorinated compounds (perfluorooctanyl sulfonate at a mean concentration 0.09. ppm wet weight). The persistent organic compounds concentrate in tissues with higher fat content notably back-depot fat. Numerous factors influence exposure, residues detected and concentrations in different individuals, species and tissues which must be understood to provide meaningful assessment of the impacts of exposure. Exposure can lead to not only acute and lethal impacts, but also physiological sub-lethal and chronic effects, often linked to the annual cycle of fat deposition and withdrawal. Current challenges for bat conservation include collation of a more extensive and standardized database of bat exposure, especially to current use pesticides and emerging contaminants, and better prediction and definition of toxicity end points notably for the sub-lethal effects. Understanding sub-lethal effects will be of greater importance for sustaining populations in the longer-term. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Ecosystems; Histology; Organic chemicals; Pesticides; Tissue; Toxicity; Bats; Brominated flame retardants; Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane; Mortality; Organic contaminant; Organochlorine pesticides; Persistent organic compounds; Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Tissue engineering; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethane; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; beta hexachlorocyclohexane; campheclor; chlordane; chlorphenotane; chlorpyrifos; dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene; dieldrin; endrin; fenvalerate; flame retardant; heptachlor epoxide; hexachlorobenzene; hexachlorocyclohexane; lindane; nonachlor; organic compound; organochlorine pesticide; organotin compound; oxychlordane; pentachlorophenol; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanylsulfonate; permethrin; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polyfluoroalkyl compound; pyrethroid; unclassified drug; annual cycle; bat; concentration (composition); ecosystem service; mortality; organic pollutant; organochlorine; pesticide; population decline; bat; behavior change; bioaccumulation; carcinogenesis; diet; ecosystem; environmental protection; exposure; foraging; immunotoxicity; lipid storage; longevity; metabolism; nonhuman; pollutant; prediction; priority journal; reproductive toxicity; review; risk assessment; species difference; survival; toxicity testing; trend study; Bats; Mortality; Organic contaminants; Pesticides; Animals; Chiroptera; DDT; Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Organic Chemicals; Pesticides; Tissue Distribution"

Classically, adolescent males develop initially progressive weakness followed by spontaneous stabilization within several years after onset. The pathogenesis of the disease is unclear and pathologic studies are lacking. However the prevailing theory postulates that insufficient growth of the dura relative to the spinal column during puberty allows forward displacement of the dura in flexion with compression of the spinal cord, possibly leading to ischemia of the anterior horn cells at C8 and Th1. Most reported cases have been from Asia, particularly Japan, though some have been reported from India, the Middle East, and Europe. To date, and to our knowledge, there has been no published study characterizing the MR imaging features of this disease in Bulgaria. Routine MR imaging of patients with HD has shown segmental cord atrophy, rarely associated with Th2 abnormalities. Previous studies of other cord diseases have shown, that the extent of cord tissue damage is usually underestimated by using routine MR imaging and that brain plasticity might limit the clinical consequences of cord injury. In this study, we used a multiparametric MR imaging approach to investigate in a patient with HD.","adolescent; anterior horn cell; case report; dura mater; human; male; muscle atrophy; muscle weakness; onset age; puberty; review; spinal cord compression; susceptibility weighted imaging; Th1 cell; vertebra dislocation"

Similar to the vast majority of antibiotics, drugs for Mycobacterium tuberculosis are directed against microbial targets. Although more effective drugs that target the bacterium may lead to faster cure of patients, it is possible that a biological limit will be reached that can be overcome only by adopting a fundamentally new treatment approach. TB regimens might be improved by including agents that target host pathways. Recent work on host-pathogen interactions, host immunity, and host-directed interventions suggests that supplementing anti-TB therapy with host modulators may lead to shorter treatment times, a reduction in lung damage caused by the disease, and a lower risk of relapse or reinfection. We undertook this review to identify molecular pathways of the host that may be amenable to modulation by small molecules for the treatment of TB. Although several approaches to augmenting standard TB treatment have been proposed, only a few have been explored in detail or advanced to preclinical and clinical studies. Our review focuses on molecular targets and inhibitory small molecules that function within the macrophage or other myeloid cells, on host inflammatory pathways, or at the level of TB-induced lung pathology. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.","2 chloro 5 nitrobenzanilide; acetylsalicylic acid; alisporivir; berberine; br 49653; ciglitazone; cilostazol; colecalciferol; desipramine; ergocalciferol; etanercept; isoniazid; mepenzolate; netoglitazone; nitazoxanide; oxidoreductase; pentoxifylline; perfluorononanoic acid; prednisolone; protein kinase R; pyrazinamide; rapamycin; recombinant gamma interferon; rhodanine; rivoglitazone; sildenafil; thalidomide; tuberculostatic agent; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; vitamin D; antibiotic therapy; autophagy; bacterial load; cell death; drug dose comparison; homeostasis; host pathogen interaction; immune response; lipid metabolism; macrophage; macrophage function; meningitis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; phagosome; review; treatment duration; tuberculosis; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Tuberculosis"

In particular, characterization of the enantiomeric excess of amino acids gives relevant information about the biotic or abiotic origin of molecules, because it is generally assumed that life elsewhere could be based on either l or d amino acids, but not both. The analytical procedures used in in-situ space missions for chiral discrimination of amino acids must meet severe requirements imposed by flight conditions: short analysis time, low energy consumption, robustness, storage for long periods under extreme conditions, high efficiency and sensitivity, automation, and remote-control operation. Such methods are based on gas chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography, and capillary electrophoresis, usually coupled with mass spectrometry; of these, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is the only such combination yet used in space missions. Preliminary in-situ sample derivatization is required before GC-MS analysis to convert amino acids into volatile and thermally stable compounds. The silylation reagent most commonly used, N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide, is unsuitable for detection of homochirality, and alternative derivatization techniques have been developed that preserve the stereochemical configuration of the original compounds and are compatible with spaceflight conditions. These include the reagent N,N-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal, which has already been used in the Rosetta mission, a mixture of alkyl chloroformate, ethanol, and pyridine, a mixture of perfluorinated anhydrides and perfluoro alcohols, and hexafluoroacetone, the first gaseous derivatizing agent. In all the space instruments, solvent extraction of organic matter and chemical derivatization have been combined in a single automatic and remote-controlled procedure in a chemical reactor. Liquid-based separation systems have been used in space missions. In particular, microchip capillary electrophoresis, based on microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems, enables high-performance chemical analysis of amino acids with low mass and volume equipment and low power and reagent consumption. Coupling with laser-induced fluorescence detectors results in ultra-low limits of detection. This critical review describes applications of the on-board instruments used in the Rosetta mission to comets and in the more recent Mars exploration program, i.e., the Mars Science Laboratory and ExoMars missions.

Determination of their concentration in environment (such as water bodies, soil, sediment, air) is an indirect tool to estimate the community level consumption of illicit drug and to evaluate potential ecotoxicological impacts from chronic low level exposure. They enter the wastewater network as unaltered drugs and/or their active metabolites by human excretion after illegal consumption or by accidental or deliberate disposal from clandestine drug laboratories. This article critically reviews the occurrence and concentration levels of illicit drugs and their metabolites in different environmental compartments (e.g., wastewater, surface waters, groundwater, drinking water, and ambient air) and their potential impact on the ecosystem. There is limited published information available on the presence of illicit drugs in the environment, reports are available mainly from European countries, UK, USA, and Canada but there is a lack of information from the remainder of the world. Although the environmental concentrations are not very high, they can potentially impact the human health and ecosystem functioning. Cocaine, morphine, amphetamine, and MDMA have potent pharmacological activities and their presence as complex mixtures in water may cause adverse effect on aquatic organisms and human health.

For this, effective food traceability system (FTS) is important. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive literature review on food traceability issues. About 74 studies, mainly focusing on food traceability issues and published during 2000-2013, were reviewed. Based on the review results, the definition, driving forces, barriers in developing and implementing FTSs, benefits, traceability technologies, improvements, and performances of FTSs have been identified and discussed. Considering FTS as an integral part of logistics management, new conceptual definition of FTS has been provided. This review has pointed out that the issue of developing effective and full chain FTS is quite complex in nature as it requires a deeper understanding of real processes from different perspectives such as economic, legal, technological, and social issues. Therefore, future researches (recommended here) on traceability should focus on: integration of traceability activities with food logistics activities; technological aspects of FTSs; the linkage between traceability system and food production units; standardization of data capturing and information exchange; awareness creation strategies; continuity of information flow and effective communication of traceability information to consumers and other stakeholders; the linkage between different drivers of FTS; improvement strategies of FTS; and development of performance evaluation frameworks for FTSs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Analytical methods used for PFASs determinations are dominated by chromatography, mostly in combination with mass spectrometric detection. However, HPLC may be also hyphenated with conductivity or fluorimetric detection, and gas chromatography may be combined with flame ionization or electron capture detection. The presence of a large number of PFASs species in environmental and biological samples necessitates parallel attempts to develop a total PFASs index that reflects the total content of PFASs in various matrices.

Such surfaces are often compared to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which exhibits a low surface energy, accompanied by biological and chemical inertness, making perfluorinated interfaces applicable to a wide range of technologies. In thin-film research, self-assembled monolayers derived from fluorinated alkanethiols (FSAMs) serve as well-defined systems that can be used to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of interfaces produced with varying degrees of fluorination. The characteristics of these surfaces have been attributed to both the chemical composition of the individual molecular adsorbates and the consequent structural features associated with monolayers formed from these unique partially fluorinated adsorbates. Specifically, this review seeks to correlate the structural and interfacial properties of FSAMs on gold with the structure/composition of the fluorinated moiety present in the adsorbed molecules and to highlight how the degree of fluorination influences the interfacial ordering of the individual alkanethiolate chains and the vacuum energy levels of the modified metal substrate. Additionally, the thermal stability of these organic thin films is analyzed as a function of adsorbate structure. Included are highlights of some of the studies in which FSAMs, formed from a variety of new types of surfactants, were used to modify colloidal systems, to generate anti-adhesive materials, and to enhance the stability of fluorinated thin films toward low-energy electron degradation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.","Adsorbates; Electrons; Fluorination; Fluorine; Organic polymers; Self assembled monolayers; Surfaces; Thin films; Adsorbate structures; Chemical compositions; Low energy electrons; Partially fluorinated; Physical and chemical properties; Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE); Self-assembled monolayer films; Structure and properties; Halogenation"

Perfluorosulfonic acid membranes, e.g. Nafion, are widely used in fuel cell technology; but, despite their success, they show some drawbacks such as high cost, limited operating temperature range and high methanol crossover. These limit their widespread commercial application in DMFCs. Such disadvantages are inspiring worldwide research activities for developing new PEM materials based on non-perfluorinated polymers as alternative to Nafion for DMFCs. A review of membrane properties is carried out on the basis of thermal stability, methanol crossover and proton conductivity. The analysis of DMFC performance covers perfluorosulfonic acid membranes (PFSA), sulfonated aromatic polymers (SAPs) and composite membranes. PFSA membranes are suitable materials in terms of power density, SAPs are more advantageous regarding the low methanol permeability and cost, whereas composite membranes are more appropriate for operation above 100 C. DMFC power density values reported in literature show that, although there are remarkable research efforts on this subject, the achieved results are not yet satisfying.

Furthermore, the emphasis has shifted from blood replacement fluid to ""O2 therapeutics"" that restore tissue oxygenation to specific tissues regions. This review covers the different alternatives, potential and limitations of hemoglobin-based O2 carriers (HBOCs) and perfluorocarbon-based O2 carriers (PFCOCs), with emphasis on the physiologic conditions disturbed in the situation that they will be used. It describes how concepts learned from plasma expanders without O2-carrying capacity can be applied to maintain O2 delivery and summarizes the microvascular responses due to HBOCs and PFCOCs. This review also presents alternative applications of HBOCs and PFCOCs namely: 1) How HBOC O2 affinity can be engineered to target O2 delivery to hypoxic tissues; and 2) How the high gas solubility of PFCOCs provides new opportunities for carrying, dissolving, and delivering gases with biological activity. It is concluded that the development of current blood substitutes has amplified their applications horizon by devising therapeutic functions for O2 carriers requiring limited O2 delivery capacity restoration. Conversely, full, blood-like O2-carrying capacity reestablishment awaits the control of O2 carrier toxicity.

Gold complexes also incorporate a number of CF3 moieties in an effort to induce inter- or intramolecular hydrogen bonds in addition to aurophilic Au ··· Au interactions (of comparable strength to an H bond), leading to materials with different structures and properties when compared with non-fluorinated ligands. In the few rare cases where unsaturated ligands (such as ethylene) are coordinated to a gold center, such complexes seem to predominate amongst fluorinated gold complexes. This Comment attempts to describe all fluoro- and fluoroalkyl complexes of gold, an increasingly active area of research during the past decade. This work covers gold complexes that contain either a direct Au-F bond or a F-C(alkyl) bond, and excludes ligands of the type C6H5-nFn (n = 1-5), which have been previously reviewed.

It requires the association of FtsZ with other proteins to assemble a dynamic ring during septation, forming part of the functionally active division machinery, the divisome. FtsZ reversibly interacts with FtsA and ZipA at the cytoplasmic membrane to form a proto-ring, the first molecular assembly of the divisome, which is ultimately joined by the rest of the division-specific proteins. In this review we summarize the quantitative approaches used to study the activity, interactions, and assembly properties of FtsZ under well-defined solution conditions, with the aim of furthering our understanding of how the behavior of FtsZ is controlled by nucleotides and physiological ligands. The modulation of the association and assembly properties of FtsZ by excluded-volume effects, reproducing in part the natural crowded environment in which this protein has evolved to function, will be described. The subsequent studies on the reactivity of FtsZ in membrane-like systems using biochemical, biophysical, and imaging technologies are reported. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges to be met to achieve construction of the minimum protein set needed to initiate bacterial division, without cells, in a cell-like compartment. This integrated approach, combining quantitative and synthetic strategies, will help to support (or dismiss) conclusions already derived from cellular and molecular analysis and to complete our understanding on how bacterial division works. © 2013 International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB) and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli"

Only a small number of molecular studies have been carried out for the characterization of the underlying genetic defects in these cases. Purpose: Reporting the first family from the Arabian Gulf region with multiple members affected by meningococcemia and abscent serum complement 5 (C5). We tried to correlate clinical, biochemical and molecular genetics features of this family. Methods: Determination of the serum level of all complement proteins including the terminal cascade (C5-9), followed by mutation analysis on DNA extracted from fresh blood samples of each alive family member. Results: Molecular studies showed a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 1, with the change of cytosine to thymine at position 55 (55C > T) leading to change of the glutamine amino acid at position 19 to a stop codon (Q19X), and serologically absence of C5 in the serum. A similar but compound heterozygous mutation has been reported in one African-American family. previously. Conclusion: Characterization of the underlying mutations in C5 deficient families is important, to understand this uncommon complement deficiency, and try to elucidate structure-function relationships in the C5 gene.

These equations require the potential energy and its gradient for the chemical system under study, and they may be obtained directly from an electronic structure theory. This article reviews such direct dynamics simulations. The accuracy of classical chemical dynamics is considered, with simulations highlighted for the F- + CH3OOH reaction and of energy transfer in collisions of CO2 with a perfluorinated self-assembled monolayer (F-SAM) surface. Procedures for interfacing chemical dynamics and electronic structure theory computer codes are discussed. A Hessian-based predictor-corrector algorithm and high-accuracy Hessian updating algorithm, for enhancing the efficiency of direct dynamics simulations, are described. In these simulations, an ensemble of trajectories is calculated which represents the experimental and chemical system under study. Algorithms are described for selecting the appropriate initial conditions for bimolecular and unimolecular reactions, gas-surface collisions, and initializing trajectories at transition states and conical intersections. Illustrative direct dynamics simulations are presented for the Cl- + CH3I SN2 reaction, unimolecular decomposition of the epoxy resin constituent CH3-NH-CH=CH-CH3 versus temperature, collisions and reactions of N-protonated diglycine with a F-SAM surface that has a reactive head group, and the product energy partitioning for the post-transition state dynamics of C2H5F → HF + C2H4 dissociation. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Conical intersection; Electronic structure theory; Energy partitioning; Post-transition state; Predictor-corrector algorithm; Quasiclassical trajectories; Unimolecular decompositions; Unimolecular reactions; Algorithms; Carbon dioxide; Chemical reactions; Dynamics; Electronic structure; Energy transfer; Epoxy resins; Equations of motion; Ethylene; Matrix algebra; Self assembled monolayers; Trajectories; Fluorine"

Fosfomycin is a broad-spectrum bactericidal antibiotic that inhibits cell wall biosynthesis in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. This antibiotic has a unique mechanism of action and inhibits the initial step in peptidoglycan biosynthesis by blocking the enzyme, MurA. Fosfomycin has been used successfully for the treatment of urinary tract infections for a long time, but the increased emergence of antibiotic resistance has made fosfomycin a suitable candidate for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens, especially in combination with other therapeutic partners. The acquisition of fosfomycin resistance could threaten the reintroduction of this antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infection. Here, we analyse the mechanism of action and molecular mechanisms for the development of fosfomycin resistance, including the modification of the antibiotic target, reduced antibiotic uptake and antibiotic inactivation.

This paper proposes a review on the PHCs in feathers and factors influencing the pollutant load. Special attention has given to external contamination and the main analytical methods used to detect these compounds in feathers. Some authors have found strong and significant correlations between the concentrations of PHCs in feathers and internal tissues, providing positive expectations for their future use in the field of ecotoxicology. However, changes in diet, time elapsed between the previous molt period and sampling, sample size, and/or external contamination have been suggested as possible causes to explain the lack of correlations reported in some studies. Further studies with newly grown feathers and blood samples would be required in order to clarify this issue. Although atmospheric deposition has been reported as cause of external contamination, preening oil seems to be the most relevant factor contributing to this process. Unfortunately, washing techniques tested to date are not able to effectively remove the surface contamination from barbs and shafts, and therefore, it is necessary to develop methods able to discriminate between internal and external contamination. Finally, in this review, deposition rate is proposed as a measurement unit, as this allows comparisons between different parts of the same feather, as well as between different feathers. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","Deposition rates; Meteorological problems; Analytical method; Atmospheric depositions; Biomonitoring tools; External contamination; Internal tissues; Nondestructive tools; Polyhalogenated compounds; Surface contaminations; Contamination; chlordane; chlorphenotane; lindane; organochlorine pesticide; organohalogen derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polybrominated biphenyl; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polyhalogenated compound; unclassified drug; atmospheric deposition; biomonitoring; blood; concentration (composition); ecotoxicology; feather; molt; organohalogen; pollutant property; sampling; air pollutant; air pollution; analytic method; atmospheric deposition; bioaccumulation; biological monitoring; bird; blood sampling; body distribution; diet; feather; human; nonhuman; review; sample size; sampling; tissues"

Studies have investigated the role of a number of maternal environmental exposures on subsequent allergic disorders in the offspring. We summarize findings from recent studies on prenatal environmental factors influencing IgE levels, atopy, and early asthma. Recent Findings: A building literature supports the influence of maternal exposure to environmental pollutants, such as allergens, traffic-related air pollution, tobacco smoke, and organochlorine compounds and social factors on allergic outcomes. More novel associations have been investigated, such as the effect of prenatal exposures to phthalates, bisphenol A, and magnetic fields. There is also rising interest in epigenetics as a pathway of action by which maternal exposure affect immune health. Summary: Emerging research highlights the challenges of investigating in-utero exposures and of relating exposures to such a heterogeneous and complex outcome as allergic disease. Further research is needed on the mechanisms by which prenatal exposure influences allergic response in childhood and how postnatal, familial and social factors, and sex can modify disease outcomes. Epigenetics is a promising new frontier, and likely one of several explanatory factors.

Although other weak interactions and their influence on the structure and chemistry of various molecules, complexes and materials have been investigated thoroughly, the field of halogen bonding is still quite unexplored and its impact on chemistry in general is yet to be fully revealed. In principle, every Y-X bond (Y = electron-withdrawing atom or moiety, X = halogen atom) can act as a halogen-bond donor when the halogen is polarized enough by Y. Perfluorohalocarbons are iconic halogen-bond donor molecules in which Y is a perfluorinated aryl or alkyl moiety and X is either iodine or bromine. In this article, alternative halogen-bond motifs such as X 2···A and Ar-X···A [A = Lewis basic halogen-bond-accepting atom of a molecule or ion; Ar = neutral or charged (hetero)aromatic system] are reviewed. In addition, haloalkenes, haloalkynes, N-haloamides and other non-metallic halogen-bond donors and their respective halogen-bonded structures will also be described. Although purely organic halogen-bonding motifs are very prominent, the role of metal complexes in halogen bonding is becoming increasingly evident as well, which is also reflected in this review. Finally, halogen bonding in solution is briefly highlighted. Contemporary research is proving that halogen bonding is more than a solid-state phenomenon and is now a well-recognized weak interaction in chemistry. Halogen bonding is an attractive non-covalent interaction between an electrophilic halogen donor atom and a nucleophilic acceptor atom. The figure depicts halogen bonds between the electrophilic iodine atoms of four N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) molecules and the nucleophilic nitrogen atoms of hexamethylenetetraamine (HMTA).

This review describes advances in controlling structure and photophysical properties in polyfluorene solutions and gels. It discusses the demarcation lines between solutions, gels, and macrophase separation in conjugated polymers and reviews essential solid state properties needed for understanding of solutions. It gives an insight into polyfluorene and polyfluorene beta phase in solutions and gels and describes all the structural levels in solvent matrices, ranging from intramolecular structures to the diverse aggregate classes and network structures and agglomerates of these units. It goes on to describe the kinetics and thermodynamics of these structures. It details the manifold molecular parameters used in their control and continues with the molecular confinement and touches on permanently cross-linked networks. Particular focus is placed on the experimental results of archetypical polyfluorenes and solvent matrices and connection between structure and photonics. A connection is also made to the mean field type theories of hairy-rod like polymers. This altogether allows generalizations and provides a guideline for materials scientists, synthetic chemists and device engineers as well, for this important class of semiconductor, luminescent polymers. The structural hierarchies of polyfluorenes in solution and gel range from intramolecular structures to the diverse aggregate classes, network structures and agglomerates of these units including the curious beta phase. These structures can be controlled by solvent quality, side chain branching, side chain length, molecular weight, thermal history and myriad functionalisations.

The cellular fatty acids which are involved in protein acylation are mainly saturated fatty acids. Palmitoylation (S-acylation) corresponds to the reversible attachment of palmitic acid (C16:0) to the side chain of a cysteine residue via a thioester bond. N-terminal myristoylation refers to the covalent attachment of myristic acid (C14:0) by an amide bond to the N-terminal glycine of many eukaryotic and viral proteins. Octanoylation (O-acylation) typically concerns the formation of an ester bond between octanoic acid (caprylic acid, C8:0) and the side chain of a serine residue of the gut and brain peptide ghrelin. An increasing number of proteins (enzymes, receptors, oncogenes, tumor suppressors, proteins involved in signal transduction, eukaryotic and viral structural proteins) have been shown to undergo fatty acid acylation. The acyl moiety can mediate protein subcellular localization, protein-protein interaction or protein-membrane interaction. Therefore, through the covalent modification of proteins, saturated fatty acids exhibit emerging specific and important roles in modulating protein functions.

This study was designed to explore the association between PFCs and cognitive ability in older adults. Methods: We assessed the association between four PFCs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and self-reported limitation due to difficulty remembering or periods of confusion using data from participants aged 60-85 years from the 1999-2000 and 2003-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. We also considered whether diabetic status or diabetic medication use modifies this association in light of in vitro evidence that PFCs may act on the same receptors as some diabetic medications. Results: In multivariable adjusted models, point estimates suggest a protective association between PFCs and self-reported cognitive limitation (odds ratio, OR; 95% confidence interval, CI) for a doubling in PFC concentration: PFOS (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78, 1.03), PFOA (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.78, 1.09), PFNA (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.79, 1.04) and PFHxS (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.82, 1.06). The protective association was concentrated in diabetics, with strong, significant protective associations in nonmedicated diabetics. Conclusions: This cross-sectional study suggests that there may be a protective association between exposure to PFCs and cognition in older adults, particularly diabetics. Copyright © 2012 S.

This is clearly exemplified by the reactions of condensation, the inertness of triflamide to strong electrophiles that easily react with other sulfonamides, the different courses of the reactions with alkenes in the same oxidative system (t-BuOCl + NaI), and other specific patterns of reactivity demonstrated by triflamide and its analogues. Two principal synthetic approaches to triflamides and other perfluoroalkylsulfonamides are the reaction of the corresponding fluoroalkylsulfonyl fluorides RFSO2F with ammonia or amines. Structurally, considering the planarity of the amino group, triflamides are intermediate between carboxamides and nonfluorinated sulfonamides.

Undecanol (C11) was found to be the most potent fungicide against this yeast with the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of 25 μg/ml (0.14 mM), followed by decanol (C10) with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 50 μg/ml (0.31 mM). The time-kill curve study showed that undecanol was fungicidal against S. cerevisiae at any growth stages. This fungicidal activity was not influenced by pH values. Dodecanol (C12) was the most effective fungistatic but did not show any fungicidal activity up to 1600 μg/mL. Fungistatic dodecanol quickly reduced cell viability, but the cell viability recovered shortly after and then finally became no longer different from the control indicating that the effect of dodecanol on S. cerevisiae was classified as a sublethal damage. However, fungistatic dodecanol combined with sublethal amount of anethole showed a fungicidal activity against this yeast. Anethole completely restricted the recovery of cell viability. Therefore expression of the synergistic effect was probably due to the blockade of the recovering process from dodecanol induced-stress. The alkanols tested inhibited glucose-induced acidification by inhibiting the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Octanol (C8) increased plasma membrane fluidity in the spheroplast cells of S. cerevisiae. The same series of aliphatic primary alkanols was also tested against a food spoilage fungus Zygosaccharomyces bailii and compared with their effects against S. cerevisiae. Decanol was found to be the most potent fungicide against Z. bailii with an MFC of 50 μg/ml (0.31 mM), whereas undecanol was found to be the most potent fungistatic with an MIC of 25 μg/ml (0.14 mM). The time-kill curve study showed that decanol was fungicidal against Z. bailii at any growth stage. This antifungal activity was slightly enhanced in combination with anethole. The primary antifungal action of medium-chain (C9-C 12) alkanols comes from their ability as nonionic surfactants to disrupt the native membrane-associated function of the integral proteins. Hence, the antifungal activity of alkanols is mediated by biophysical process, and the maximum activity can be obtained when balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic portions becomes the most appropriate. © Springer Science+Business Media 2013.","alkanol; anethole; decanol; glucose; lauryl alcohol; octanol; proton transporting adenosine triphosphatase; undecanol; acidification; cell membrane fluidity; cell viability; drug concentration; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug potency; drug potentiation; fungicidal activity; fungus growth; growth inhibition; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; minimum fungicidal concentration; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; priority journal; review; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; spheroplast; yeast; Zygosaccharomyces bailii"

Many polyfluoroalkyl chemicals are potential perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) precursors. When they are released to the environment, abiotic and microbial degradation of non-fluorinated functionalities, polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl moieties can result in perfluoroalkyl carboxylic (PFCAs) and sulfonic acids (PFSAs), such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). These highly persistent and ubiquitously detected PFAAs are the subjects of many regulations and actions due to their toxic profiles. In order to confidently evaluate the environmental fate and effects of these precursors and their links to PFSAs and PFCAs, we present the review into the environmental biodegradability studies carried out with microbial culture, activated sludge, soil and sediment in the past decade. First, we propose that the knowledge gap caused by the lack of direct detection of precursor chemicals in environmental samples can be bridged by laboratory investigations of important precursors such as fluorotelomer-based compounds and perfluoroalkane sulfonamido derivatives. Then we evaluate the experimental setups and methodologies, sampling and sample preparation methods, and analytical techniques that have been successfully applied. Third, we provide the most updated knowledge on quantitative and qualitative relationships between precursors and PFSAs or PFCAs, microbial degradation pathways, half-lives of precursors, defluorination potential, and novel degradation intermediates and products. In the end, we identify knowledge gaps and suggest research directions with regard to future biodegradation studies, environmental monitoring and ecotoxicological assessment of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Chemical detection; Industrial chemicals; Microbiology; Microorganisms; Ecotoxicological assessment; Laboratory investigations; Pathway; Perfluoroalkyl; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; Polyfluoroalkyl; Precursor; Sample preparation methods; Biodegradation; fluorinated hydrocarbon; fluorotelomer; fluorotelomer acrylate; fluorotelomer alcohol derivative; fluorotelomer citrate ester; fluorotelomer ethoxylate derivative; fluorotelomer methacrylate; fluorotelomer phosphate ester; fluorotelomer stearate ester; fluorotelomer sulfonate; fluorotelomer urethane derivative; n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoethanol; perfluoroalkane sulfonamido derivative; perfluoroalkyl acid; perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid derivative; perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl derivative; unclassified drug; activated sludge; biodegradation; environmental fate; microbial activity; microorganism; organofluorine; activated sludge; aerobic microbial degradation; anaerobic microbial degradation; analytic method; bacterium culture; biodegradability; defluorination; ecotoxicity; environment; environmental monitoring; half life time; methodology; microbial degradation; nonhuman; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; review; sampling; sediment; soil"

Due to the lack of functional groups of the hydrocarbons, enantiorecognition in the presence of cyclodextrins is ascribed to weak van der Waals forces. Thermodynamic parameters of enantiorecognition between four chiral alkanes and octakis(6- O -methyl-2,3-di- O -pentyl)- g -cyclodextrin (Lipodex G) have been determined. The possible role of molecular inclusion is indicated by the complete loss of enantioselectivity when the cyclodextrins are replaced by the corresponding linear dextrins. The substitution pattern and cavity size of the modi fi ed cyclodextrins have a pronounced effect on the degree of enantiorecognition observed. On mixed binary cyclodextrin stationary phases, all C7 and C8 chiral alkanes possessing one stereogenic center can be enantioseparated simultaneously.

Here we reviewed sorption coefficients for PFCs derived from laboratory experiments and compared these values with the gross distribution between the concentrations of PFCs in surface waters and sediments or between wastewater and sewage sludge. Sorption experiments with perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) suggest that their sorption can be described reasonably well as a partitioning-like process with an average logKoc of approximately 2.8 for PFOA and 3.0 for PFOS. However, median concentrations in sediments (PFOA, 0.27ngg-1; PFOS, 0.54ngg-1) or sewage sludge (PFOA, 37ngg-1; PFOS, 69ngg-1) in relation to median concentrations in surface water (PFOA, 3ngl-1; PFOS, 3ngl-1) or wastewater treatment effluent (PFOA, 24ngl-1; PFOS, 11ngl-1), suggest that effective logKoc distribution coefficients for the field situation may be close to 3.7 for PFOA and 4.2 for PFOS. Applying lab-based logKoc distribution coefficients can therefore result in a serious overestimation of PFC concentrations in water and in turn to an underestimation of the residence time of PFOA and PFOS in contaminated soils.

This paper presents the findings of a review of the literature on the impact of PFOS on the health of the general population. Fifteen relevant epidemiological studies were identified that looked at the association between human PFOS exposure and a range of health related outcomes. Small but statistically significant associations have been reported with PFOS and total cholesterol, glucose metabolism, body mass index (BMI), thyroid function, infertility, breast feeding, uric acid and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The true significance of these findings is uncertain due to the inconsistencies in some of the study results and the limitations of the literature. The majority of studies were cross-sectional and considered surrogate markers of health (e.g. cholesterol levels). The available literature is also limited in ascertaining the link between PFOS concentrations in the environment, exposure pathways and health effects.

This problem has been tackled by regulatory bodies by proposing EQS for biota in EU water bodies and tolerable daily intake for food. The introduction of regulatory limits requires the availability of harmonised and validated analytical methods of sufficient sensitivity. This paper reviews recent advances in analytical methods for analysis of PFAS in aquatic organisms. The methods available for biota analysis are mostly based on three extraction procedures: ion-pair extraction, solvent liquid extraction, and alkaline digestion. The resulting extracts are then subjected to different clean-up or enrichment steps on solid adsorbents, for example graphitized carbon black, C18, and WAX phases. All methods reviewed in this work give reliable results but are partially validated only, because of the lack of certified reference materials and regular interlaboratory exercises. The few interlaboratory exercises performed on real unspiked samples did not afford satisfactory results for PFAS other than PFOS, especially for matrices with high lipid content, for example mussels. The reasons for those partially negative results have been identified, and can mainly be attributed to calibration procedures and availability and purity of standards. The urgent need for certified reference materials for this type of analysis is emphasized. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Alkaline digestion; Analytical method; Aquatic organisms; Biota analysis; Calibration procedure; Certified reference materials; Environmental problems; Extraction method; Extraction procedure; Graphitized carbon black; Interlaboratory exercise; Ion pairs; LC-MS; Lipid content; Liquid extraction; Perfluorinated compounds; Regulatory bodies; Regulatory limit; Solid adsorbents; Tolerable daily intake; Waterbodies; Biochemistry; Reviews; Carbon black; carbon; fluorocarbon; lipid; solvent; animal; aquatic species; bivalve; calibration; chemistry; environmental monitoring; Europe; fish; human; mass spectrometry; metabolism; methodology; pollutant; quality control; review; sensitivity and specificity; shellfish; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Bivalvia; Calibration; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Europe; Fishes; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Lipids; Mass Spectrometry; Quality Control; Sensitivity and Specificity; Shellfish; Solvents"

In utero exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), a major psychoactive component of marijuana, is associated with an increased risk for anencephaly and neurobehavioural deficiencies in the offspring, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disabilities, and memory impairment. Recent studies demonstrate that the developing central nervous system (CNS) is susceptible to the effects of Δ9-THC and other cannabimimetics, including the psychoactive ingredients of the branded product 'Spice' branded products. These exocannabinoids interfere with the function of an endocannabinoid (eCB) system, present in the developing CNS from E12.5 (week 5 of gestation in humans), and required for proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neurons. Until recently, it was not known whether the eCB system is also present in the developing CNS during the initial stages of its ontogeny, i.e. from E7.0 onwards (week 2 of gestation in humans), and if so, whether this system is also susceptible to the action of exocannabinoids. Here, we review current data, in which the presence of an eCB system during the initial stage of development of the CNS is demonstrated. Furthermore, we focus on recent advances on the effect of canabimimetics on early gestation. The relevance of these findings and potential adverse developmental consequences of in utero exposure to 'high potency' marijuana, Spice branded products and/or cannabinoid research chemicals during this period is discussed. Finally, we address the implication of these findings in terms of the potential dangers of synthetic cannabinoid use during pregnancy, and the ongoing debate over legalization of marijuana. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","2,3 dihydro 5 methyl 3 (morpholinomethyl) 6 (1 naphthoyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3 de][1,4]benzoxazine; 3 (1 naphthoyl) 1 pentylindole; 4 (1,1 dimethylheptyl) 1',2',3',4',5',6' hexahydro 2,3' dihydroxy 6' (3 hydroxypropyl)biphenyl; am 2201; am 694; cannabinoid 1 receptor; cannabis; cp 47497 c8; dexanabinol; dronabinol; endocannabinoid; excipient; exocannabinoid derivative; illicit drug; jwh 073; jwh 210; jwh 398; jwn 250; jzl 184; nabilone; nabiximols; nam; oxiran acetate; oxiran hexanoate; psychotropic agent; rcs 08; rcs 4; rcs 4 c4; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; urb 602; urb 602 carbamate; wwl 70; anencephalus; antidepressant activity; behavior disorder; brain development; brain region; cell migration; cell proliferation; drug potency; human; mental disease; nerve cell differentiation; nerve degeneration; neuroprotection; neurotransmission; nonhuman; ontogeny; pregnant woman; prenatal exposure; prevalence; priority journal; review; spice; synthesis; tranquilizing activity; Anencephaly; Animals; Cannabinoids; Central Nervous System; Drug and Narcotic Control; Female; Humans; Marijuana Abuse; Maternal Exposure; Mental Disorders; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Tetrahydrocannabinol"

In the area of hydrolase-catalysed biotransformations, lipases have been used in dynamic kinetic resolutions of amines at low-temperature using radical-based racemisation methods. A system has also been developed for the lipase catalysed desymmetrisation of allenic diols. An unusual promiscuous activity of formate dehydrogenase has been described in which the enzyme catalysed a hydrolytic reaction. In reductase biotransformations, ene reductases of the Old Yellow Enzyme family have been applied to the asymmetric reduction of Baylis-Hillman adducts and also shown, in some cases, to catalyse oxazete formation in the transformation of nitro-alkenes. The carbon-carbon bond forming enzyme benzaldehyde lyase was reported to catalyse N-hydroxamic acid formation from benzaldehydes and nitrosobenzenes. An (R)-selective arylmalonate decarboxylase has been engineered either to act as a racemase or to catalyse decarooxylation with inverted enantioselectivity.

Three-dimensional (3D) modeling shows that the actual current density in OLEDs based on materials with a Gaussian electron and hole DOS is filamentary. However, it is possible to accurately calculate the average current density by solving a one-dimensional (1D) drift-diffusion equation, making use of compact expressions for the temperature, electric field, and carrier density dependent mobility which have been derived from 3D-modeling. For the cases of spatially uncorrelated energetic disorder and spatially correlated disorder due to random dipole fields, these models are called the extended Gaussian disorder model (EGDM) and extended correlated disorder model (ECDM), respectively. We discuss how the effects of trapping on guest molecules can be included, and how exciton generation is described. The application of these models to hole and electron transporting polymer and small molecule materials is discussed, with an emphasis on the modeling of the transport and emission of blue-emitting OLEDs based on a polyfluorene-derivative.

However, generation of sufficient signal i.e. 19F cell loading is a key challenge, particularly with non-phagocytic cells such as lymphocytes and stem cells. A range of 19F cell labels have been developed, including emulsions, particles, polymers, and agents for clinical use. Various animal and primary human cells, such as dendritic cells, lymphocytes and phagocytes have been successfully labeled and studied in models of autoimmune disease, inflammation and transplant rejection. Primary human cells, particularly dendritic cells as used in vaccine therapy have been tested for imminent clinical application. Here, we summarize current cell loading strategies and sensitivity of in vivo cell imaging with 19F MRI, and discuss the processing of image data for accurate quantification of cell numbers.

Though the known species display Gram-negative characteristics and the ability to ferment amino acids, no single characteristic is known which can define this group. For eight Synergistetes species, complete genome sequences or draft genomes have become available. We have used these genomes to construct detailed phylogenetic trees for the Synergistetes species and carried out comprehensive analysis to identify molecular markers consisting of conserved signature indels (CSIs) in protein sequences that are specific for either all Synergistetes or some of their sub-groups. We report here identification of 32 CSIs in widely distributed proteins such as RpoB, RpoC, UvrD, GyrA, PolA, PolC, MraW, NadD, PyrE, RpsA, RpsH, FtsA, RadA, etc., including a large [300 aa insert within the RpoC protein, that are present in various Synergistetes species, but except for isolated bacteria, these CSIs are not found in the protein homologues from any other organisms. These CSIs provide novel molecular markers that distinguish the species of the phylum Synergistetes from all other bacteria. The large numbers of other CSIs discovered in this work provide valuable information that supports and consolidates evolutionary relationships amongst the sequenced Synergistetes species. Of these CSIs, seven are specifically present in Jonquetella, Pyramidobacter and Dethiosulfovibrio species indicating a cladal relationship among them, which is also strongly supported by phylogenetic trees. A further 15 CSIs that are only present in Jonquetella and Pyramidobacter indicate a close association between these two species. Additionally, a previously described phylogenetic relationship between the Aminomonas and Thermanaerovibrio species was also supported by 9 CSIs. The strong relationships indicated by the indel analysis provide incentives for the grouping of species from these clades into higher taxonomic groups such as families or orders. The identified molecular markers, due to their specificity for Synergistetes and presence in highly conserved regions of important proteins suggest novel targets for evolutionary, genetic and biochemical studies on these bacteria as well as for the identification of additional species belonging to this phylum in different environments. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.","amino acid; bacterial protein; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing) A; molecular marker; protein FtsA; protein MraW; protein NadD; protein PolA; protein PolC; protein PyrE; protein RadA; protein RpoC; protein RpsA; protein RpsH; protein UvrD; RNA polymerase beta subunit; unclassified drug; bacterial DNA; amino acid sequence; bacterial genome; bacterial metabolism; bacterium identification; cladistics; Dethiosulfovibrio; fermentation; genetic association; genetic conservation; Gram negative bacterium; indel mutation; Jonquetella; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogenetic tree; phylum; priority journal; Pyramidobacter; review; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; Synergistetes; bacterial genome; bacterium; biology; classification; DNA fingerprinting; genetic marker; genetics; methodology; phylogeny; Aminomonas; Dethiosulfovibrio; Negibacteria; Thermanaerovibrio; Bacteria; Computational Biology; DNA Fingerprinting; DNA, Bacterial; Genetic Markers; Genome, Bacterial; INDEL Mutation; Phylogeny"

Areas covered: PXR activities are implicated in drugdrug interactions and endocrine disruption. Recent evidence supports a hepatoprotective role for PXR in chronic liver injury, inhibiting liver inflammation through suppression of the NF-κB pathway. However, PXR-mediated induction of CYP3A enhances APAP-induced acute liver injury by generating toxic metabolites. While these observations implicate PXR as a therapeutic target for liver injury, they also caution against PXR activation by pharmaceutical drugs. Expert opinion: While evidence of PXR involvement in acute and chronic liver injuries identifies it as a possible therapeutic target, it raises additional concerns for all drug candidates. The in vitro and in vivo tests for human PXR activation should be incorporated into the FDA regulations for therapeutic drug approval to identify potential liver toxicities. In addition, PXR pharmacogenetic studies will facilitate the prediction of patient-specific drug reactivities and associated liver disorders. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.","1,4 bis(3,5 dichloro 2 pyridyloxy)benzene; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; cafestol; chlordane; clofibrate; clotrimazole; corticosterone; coumestrol; dieldrin; diethylstilbestrol; endosulfan; estradiol; flucloxacillin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; hyperforin; hypocholesterolemic agent; paclitaxel; paracetamol; perfluorodecanoic acid; phenobarbital; phytoestrogen; pregnane X receptor; rifampicin; sr 12813; tacrolimus; tetracycline; trabectedin; troglitazone; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; xenobiotic agent; acute liver failure; chronic liver disease; drug clearance; drug metabolism; drug targeting; endocrine disease; genetic polymorphism; hepatitis; human; in vitro study; liver injury; liver protection; nonhuman; pharmacogenetics; review; Animals; Humans; Liver; Liver Diseases; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Receptors, Steroid"

The objectives of this report are to present a short review illustrated by a case study, followed by recommendations for future stream flow augmentation projects. Despite the fact that wastewater discharge to streams is commonplace, a water agency pursuing stream flow augmentation with recycled water will face unique challenges. For example, recycled water typically contains trace amounts of organic wastewater-derived compounds (OWCs) for which the potential ecological risks must be balanced against the benefits of an augmentation project. Successful stream flow augmentation with recycled water requires that the lead agency clearly articulate a strong project rationale and identify key benefits. It must be assumed that the public will have some concerns about water quality. Public acceptance may be better if an augmentation project has co-benefits beyond maintaining stream ecosystems, such as improving water system supply and reliability (i.e. potable use offset). Regulatory or project-specific criteria (acceptable concentrations of priority OWCs) would enable assessment of ecosystem impacts and demonstration of practitioner compliance. Additional treatment (natural or engineered) of the recycled water may be considered. If it is not deemed necessary or feasible, existing recycled water quality may be adequate to achieve project goals depending on project rationale, site and water quality evaluation, and public acceptance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Additional treatment; Environmental reuse; PFOA; PFOS; Potential ecological risk; Project goals; Public acceptance; Recycled water; Recycled water quality; Stream ecosystems; Stream habitats; Trace amounts; Wastewater discharge; Water agencies; Water quality evaluation; Water system; Ecosystems; Image enhancement; Potable water; Regulatory compliance; Reviews; Stream flow; Water quality; Water supply; Water recycling; alkylphenolpolyethoxylate metabolite; arsenic; caffeine; dimethylnitrosamine; drinking water; drug; endocrine disruptor; ground water; haloacetic acid; n butylbenzenesulfonamide; n ethylperfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetate; organic compound; organic wastewater derived compound; oxadiazon; perfluoro compound; perfluorodecanesulfonate; perfluorodecanoate; perfluoroheptanoate; perfluorohexanesulfonate; perfluorononoate; perfluorooctanesulfonamide; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; recycled water; trihalomethane; tris(2,3 dichloropropyl)phosphate; tris(3 chloropropyl)phosphate; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; water; organic compound; recycling; streamflow; wastewater; water management; water quality; water treatment; benthos; dechlorination; ecotoxicity; environmental health; environmental impact; environmental planning; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; government regulation; motivation; nonhuman; priority journal; reliability; review; risk; sewage disposal; sewer outfall; stream (river); stream flow augmentation; urban area; waste water management; waste water recycling; waste water treatment plant; water analysis; water contamination; water quality; water supply; water temperature; California; Conservation of Natural Resources; Organic Chemicals; Recycling; Rivers; Waste Water; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Stick-slip motion was not observed even for the smooth surface for the modified PFPE tape. The friction is almost independent of the PFPE structure, but depends on the amine structures. The ammonium salt being tightly anchored to the rubbing surface covers uniformly, which leads to better lubricity. The higher dispersive interaction of the hydrophobic group of the amine is endowed with a compensating friction reduction. Steric hindrance of the hydrophilic group causes a high friction. Based on these findings, a saturated long chain ammonium salt is the best selection. Moreover, the modified PFPEs are dissolved in alcohol and hexane, which makes practical use convenient without any environmental problems.

Introduction of a perfluorinated benzene ring to a rodlike molecule is effective in generating local biaxiality in the nematic and smectic A phases.

A Kinetex 2.6 μm C8 100 Å, 150× 4.6 mm column maintained at 30±1 °C was used for the separation, and further, a connection of two core-shell HPLC columns with a total column dimension of 250× 4.6 mm was also applied. The analytes were eluted with a mobile phase consisting of 0.05 M H3PO4/KH 2PO4 (pH = 2.3)-acetonitrile (7:3, v/v), with a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. A liquid-liquid extraction with 1-chlorobutane was used for the sample preparation. The validation of the canertinib analytical method resulted in recoveries in the range of 74-79 % and in relative standard deviation and accuracy lower than 15 %, both for between- and within-batch calculations. A very good linearity in the validated range (5- 10,000 ng/mL) and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 5 ng/mL were achieved. Peak width, height and peak area of six protein kinase inhibitors analysed with a core-shell column and with a conventional fully porous particle column were compared. The results showed that, for most inhibitors analysed with the core-shell analytical column, the peaks were about two to three times narrower and two to three times higher, with areas that remained almost unchanged. The presented study revealed that the application of this separation technology is a very cost-effective way to bring the LOQ of the protein kinase inhibitor analysis with an HPLC closer to the possibilities of the LC-MS/MS technique. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","Canertinib; CI-1033; Core-shell; Dasatinib; Protein kinase; Acetonitrile; Enzymes; Phase separation; Porous materials; Proteins; Shells (structures); protein kinase inhibitor; evaluation; high performance liquid chromatography; instrumentation; methodology; review; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Protein Kinase Inhibitors"

Its activation elicits proteolytic cascades which eventually results in the cleavage of the C5 protein into two fragments, C5a and C5b. The small anaphylatoxin C5a induces a variety of biological responses upon binding to the 7TM receptors C5aR and the C5L2, while the large C5b fragment nucleates formation of the membrane attack complex capable of killing susceptible pathogens by the formation of a pore structure in association with complement components C6, C7, C8, and C9. A number of regulatory molecules help to control C5 mediated immune responses towards host cells, but in several major inflammatory conditions including sepsis and arthritis, C5a is believed to contribute significantly to disease etiology. Inhibition of membrane attack complex assembly is already approved for treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. A number of recent crystal structures have provided a comprehensive insight into the architecture and properties of intact C5 and its fragments, and how pathogens interfere with their function. Here we review the functional and structural aspects of C5 and its fragments, the pathological conditions associated with them, and strategies employed by pathogens to interfere with the biological function of C5.

Hydrocarbons can be produced from alternative carbonaceous resources (natural gas, coal, biomass and waste) through FTS and the use of biomass is particularly attractive from a carbon footprint point of view. However, the nature of biomass resources dictates a different exploration approach compared to fossil fuel resources. Compared to coal and natural gas based FTS processes where economics of scale is an advantage, a Biomass-to-Liquid (BTL) plant is more suited for smaller scale operation. Thus, the BTL process economy will benefit from a condensed FTS processes. Moreover, considering the expected role of FTS in regional and global hydrocarbon supply in the near future, it becomes pertinent to strive towards improving the process economy. This requires molecular and process engineering and detailed knowledge of the reaction is a pre-requisite to engineering the reaction at molecular level. Syngas to hydrocarbon involves consecutive steps of CO activation, C-C coupling, hydrogenation and desorption of the hydrocarbon product. Atomic details of the dynamics of these steps are still unclear. Recently, clearer pictures about activation are now available. However, over the course of ninety years since the first report on an FTS, proposed pathway of C-C coupling has come full cycle from oxygenate to nonoxygenate and back to oxygenate intermediates. To this end, we attempted an X-ray of progress made at providing answers to issues in the chemistry of FTS. The review focuses on product distribution, macro kinetics and the mechanism of FTS. We compare FTS with other C-C coupling reactions of CO, identify catalytic entities for controlling product selectivity and finally we offer an outlook on future directions of fundamental research towards resolving the lingering questions on the mechanism of C-C coupling in FTS. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.","Biomass; Carbon footprint; Chemical bonds; Desorption; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Fossil fuels; Hydrocarbons; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Synthesis gas; Biomass resources; C-C coupling; C-C coupling reactions; CO activation; Economics of scale; Fossil fuel resources; Fundamental research; Hydrocarbon product; Liquid hydrocarbons; Macro kinetics; Molecular levels; Natural gas based; Product distributions; Product selectivities; Syn-gas; Coal deposits"

Recent developments in chemical analysis have revealed that fluorinated compounds have become ubiquitously spread and are regarded as a potential threats to the environment. Due to the carbon-fluorine bond, which has a very high bond strength, these chemicals are extremely persistent towards degradation and some PFCs have a potential for bioaccumulation in organisms. Of particular concern has been the developmental toxicity of PFOS and PFOA, which has been manifested in rodent studies as high mortality of prenatally exposed newborn rats and mice within 24 h after delivery. The nervous system appears to be one of the most sensitive targets of environmental contaminants. The serious developmental effects of PFCs have lead to the upcoming of studies that have investigatedneurotoxic effects of these substances. In this review the major findings of the neurotoxicity of the main PFCs and their suggested mechanisms of action are presented. The neurotoxic effects are discussed in light of other toxic effects of PFCs to indicate the significance of PFCs as neurotoxicants. The main findings are that PFCs may induce neurobehavioral effects, particularly in developmentally exposed animals. The effects are, however, subtle and inconclusive and are often induced at concentrations where other toxic effects also are expected. Mechanistic studies have shown that PFCs may affect the thyroid system, influence the calcium homeostasis, protein kinase C, synaptic plasticity and cellular differentiation. Compared to other environmental toxicants the human blood levels of PFCs are high and of particular concern is that susceptible groups may be exposed to a cocktail of substances that in combination reach harmful concentrations. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","calcium ion; chemical compound; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; glial fibrillary acidic protein; haloacid; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1beta; perfluoro 1 decanesulfonate; perfluoroalkylated compound; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorododecanoic acid; perfluoroheptane sulfonate; perfluorohexane sulfonate; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorotetradecanoic acid; perfluorotridecanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; protein kinase C alpha; protein kinase C beta; protein kinase C gamma; sulfonic acid derivative; thyrotropin; thyroxine; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; animal behavior; ataxia; binding affinity; bioaccumulation; blood brain barrier; blood level; brain level; calcium homeostasis; cell differentiation; concentration (parameters); concentration loss; environmental exposure; geographic distribution; geographical variation (species); habituation; human; lipid peroxidation; liver level; locomotion; long term potentiation; memory consolidation; nerve cell plasticity; neuromodulation; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; oxidative stress; prenatal exposure; priority journal; review; signal transduction; stress; structure analysis; tissue distribution; toxicokinetics; Alkanes; Animals; Biological Transport; Brain; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Neurons; Neurosecretory Systems; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Risk Assessment; Signal Transduction; Tissue Distribution; Animalia; Mus; Rattus; Rodentia"

The design of this study is a literature review. The scientific literature concerning BC were reviewed, especially focusing on the Arctic and the special conditions that exist in this region. Breast cancer incidence is increasing all over the world, including in the Arctic. The enormous transition in health conditions and lifestyle in the Arctic might be contributing to the known risk factors. In Greenland, the age at menarche has diminished by 3 years during the course of 100 years, and the number of children per women as well as the duration of breastfeeding is decreasing. Obesity and intake of saturated fat is increasing and the intake of traditional food rich in unsaturated fat and vitamin D decreasing. Smoking and alcohol consumption in the Arctic has been relatively high but is now decreasing. More focus on genetic susceptibility in relation to BC has identified the specific BRCA1 founder mutation in the Greenlandic population, which might appear to be an important risk factor. However, the known established risk factors alone cannot account for the increasing trend observed. Studies suggest that environmental contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) including perfluorinated compounds increase the risk of BC possibly in conjunction with certain genetic polymorphisms involved in carcinogen activation. The lipophilic POPs such as polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides are found at very high levels in the Arctic population. Several factors can explain the increasing incidence of BC in the Arctic. The transition in lifestyle and health conditions unfortunately increases the known risk factors of BC. Moreover, the population of the Arctic might show up to be especially vulnerable because of the contemporary high burden of POPs and genetic susceptibility. © 2012 Stine Overvad Fredslund and Eva Cecilie Bonefeld-Jørgensen.","Arctic; breast tumor; female; human; incidence; review; risk factor; Arctic Regions; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Incidence; Risk Factors"

Magnetic anomalies bear extremely rich information on Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic evolution. 3D analytical signal amplitudes computed from magnetic anomalies reveal very precisely relict distributions of Mesozoic sedimentary sequences on the two conjugate continental margins, and they are also found very effective in depicting later-stage magmatism and tectonic transitions and zonation within the SCS oceanic crust. Through integrated analyses of magnetic, gravity and reflection seismic data, we define the continent-ocean boundary (COB) around the South China Sea continental margin, and find that the COB coincides very well with a transition zone from mostly positive to negative free-air gravity anomalies. This accurate outlining of the COB is critical for better tracing magnetic anomalies induced by the oceanic crust. The geometrically complex COB and inner magnetic zonation require the introduction of an episodic opening model, as well as a transform fault (here coined as Zhongnan Fault) between the East and Southwest Sub-basins, while within the East and Southwest Sub-basins, magnetic anomalies are rather continuous laterally, indicating nonexistence of large transform faults within these sub-basins. We enhance magnetic anomalies caused by the shallow basaltic layer via a band-pass filter, and recognize that the likely oldest magnetic anomaly near the northern continental margin is C12 according to the magnetic time scale CK95. Near the southern continental margin, magnetic anomalies are less recognizable and the anomaly C12 appears to be missing. These differences show an asymmetrical opening style with respect to the relict spreading center, and the northern part appears to have slightly faster spreading rates than to the south. The magnetic anomalies C8 (M1 and M2, ~26 Ma) represent important magnetic boundaries within the oceanic basin, and are possibly related to changes in spreading rates and magmatic intensities. The magnetic evidence for a previously proposed ridge jump after the anomaly C7 is not clear. The age of the Southwest Sub-basin has yet to be further examined, most favorably with deep-tow magnetic surveys and ocean drilling. Our magnetic spectral study shows that the shallowest Curie points are located around the eastern part of the Southwestern Sub-basin, whereas within the East Sub-basin Curie depths are smaller to the north of the relict spreading center than to the south. This pattern of Curie depths is consistent to regional heat flow measurements and later-stage volcanic seamount distributions, and we therefore reason that Curie-depth variations are closely associated with later-stage magmatism, rather than with crustal ages. Although magnetic anomalies located around the northern continent-ocean transition zone (COT) are relatively quiet, this area is not a typical magnetic quiet zone since conceptually it differs markedly from an oceanic magnetic quiet zone. The relatively quiet magnetic anomalies are seemingly associated with a shallowing in Curie isotherm and thinning in magnetic layer, but our comprehensive observations suggest that the well-preserved thick Mesozoic sedimentary rocks are major causes for the magnetically quiet zone. The high similarities between various low-pass filtered marine and air-borne magnetic anomalies and satellite magnetic anomalies clearly confirm that deeper magnetic sources (in the lower crust and the uppermost mantle) have contributions to long-wavelength surface magnetic anomalies in the area, as already inferred from magnetically inversed Curie depths. The offshore south China magnetic anomaly (SCMA) becomes more prominent on low-pass filtered marine and air-borne magnetic anomalies and satellite magnetic anomalies, indicating very deeply-buried magnetic sources beneath it. © 2012 The Author(s).","Calluna vulgaris"

After an introduction on their productions, uses and hazards, this minireview updates non-exhaustive recent strategies of synthesis of original fluorosurfactants that may be potentially non-bioaccumulable. These routes have been devoted on: (i) the preparation of CF 3-X-(CH 2) n-SO 3Na (with X=O, C 6H 4O or N(CF 3) and n=8-12), (ii) the use of fluorinated polyethers (achieved either by oligomerization of hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO) or by ring opening cationic oligomerization of fluorinated oxetanes; (iii) the telomerization of vinylidene fluoride (VDF) with 1-iodoperfluoralkanes to produce C nF 2n+1-(VDF) 2-CH 2CO 2R (n=2 or 4, R=H or NH 4), (iv) the radical telomerization of 3,3,3-trifluoropropene (TFP) with isoperfluoropropyliodide to prepare (CF 3) 2CF(TFP) x-R H, and (v) the radical cotelomerization of VDF and TFP, or their controlled radical copolymerization in the presence of either (CF 3) 2CFI or a fluorinated xanthate. In most cases, the surface tensions versus the surfactant concentrations have been assessed. These above pathways led to various highly fluorinated (but yet not perfluorinated) telomers or cooligomers, the chemical changes of which enabled to obtain original surfactants as novel alternatives to PFOA, ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO), or PFOS regarded as the PCBs of the XXIst century. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Ammonium perfluorooctanoate; Chemical change; Co-oligomers; Cotelomerization; Fluorinated surfactant; Fluorosurfactants; Fluorotelomers; Half lives; Hexafluoropropylene oxide; Human serum; Oxetanes; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Radical copolymerization; Radical telomerization; Ring opening; Surfactant concentrations; Telomerization; Telomers; Vinylidene fluoride; Ammonium compounds; Biochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Ethers; Oligomerization; Oligomers; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polyethers; Polymerization; Surface tension; Surface active agents; ammonia; amphophile; cation; copolymer; hexafluoropropylene oxide; monomer; oligomer; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polymer; polystyrene; polyvinyl alcohol; propylene oxide; silicone; surfactant; unclassified drug; vinylidene fluoride; bioaccumulation; biodegradability; catalyst; chemical analysis; chemical modification; chemical structure; concentration (parameters); fluorination; gel permeation chromatography; half life time; health hazard; hydrolysis; molecular weight; oligomerization; polymerization; pressure; review; ring opening; structure analysis; surface tension; synthesis"

Should primary prevention of cardiovascular disease be a priority in this patient? In order to answer this question, we performed a systematic review of the literature to inform an evidence-based clinical review. The objective was to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the clinical management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Comprehensive literature searches were performed. The quality of each study was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale for randomized controlled trials, and the Downs and Black Scale for all other studies. Levels of evidence were assigned using a modified version of Sackett's scale. Our findings indicate that CVD is a critical issue in individuals with chronic SCI. Almost all risk factors for CVD are amplified in individuals with SCI, including physical inactivity, dyslipidemia, blood pressure irregularities, abnormal glycemic control, and chronic inflammation. However, there is a paucity of high-quality literature with respect to treatment outcomes in SCI-specific study populations (a total of 22 intervention studies in all of these categories combined) that allow for the development of evidence-informed clinical practice recommendations. These limitations notwithstanding, we present a series of contemporary practice suggestions with regard to CVD event risk modification in SCI patients. For optimal outcomes, health care providers should be cognizant of these heightened CVD risk factors and the resultant increased CVD morbidity and mortality in SCI patients. Despite the absence of high-quality evidence-based treatment strategies, clinicians should re-examine their own CVD risk factor treatment strategies to better reflect contemporary practice in similar high-CVD-event-risk patients and populations. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","antihypertensive agent; captopril; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; nifedipine; prazosin; triacylglycerol; American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale; antihypertensive therapy; autonomic dysreflexia; bicycle ergometry; blood pressure fluctuation; brain hemorrhage; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; chronic disease; chronic inflammation; clinical practice; death; dyslipidemia; electrostimulation; evidence based practice; glycemic control; health care personnel; health care quality; heart infarction; high risk patient; high risk population; human; hypertension; hypertensive crisis; immobilization; low drug dose; orthosis; orthostatic hypotension; primary prevention; randomized controlled trial (topic); rating scale; resistance training; review; spinal cord injury; traffic accident; treadmill exercise; treatment outcome; triacylglycerol blood level; Cardiovascular Diseases; Chronic Disease; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Risk Factors; Spinal Cord Injuries"

More than 45 genes encoding the proteins of complement components or their isotypes and subunits, receptors, and regulators have been discovered. These genes are distributed throughout different chromosomes, with 19 genes comprising three significant complement gene clusters in the human genome. Genetic deficiency of any early component of the classical pathway (C1q, C1r/s, C2, C4, and C3) is associated with autoimmune diseases due to the failure of clearance of immune complexes (IC) and apoptotic materials, and the impairment of normal humoral response. Deficiencies of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and the early components of the alternative (factor D, properdin) and terminal pathways (from C3 onward components: C5, C6, C7, C8, C9) increase susceptibility to infections and their recurrence. While the association of MBL deficiency with a number of autoimmune and infectious disorders has been well established, the effects of the deficiency of other lectin pathway components (ficolins, MASPs) have been less extensively investigated due to our incomplete knowledge of the genetic background of such deficiencies and the functional activity of those components. For complement regulators and receptors, the consequences of their genetic deficiency vary depending on their specific involvement in the regulatory or signalling steps within the complement cascade and beyond. This article reviews current knowledge and concepts about the genetic load of complement component deficiencies and their association with diseases. An integrative presentation of genetic data with the latest updates provides a background to further investigations of the disease association investigations of the complement system from the perspective of systems biology and systems genetics. © 2012 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","complement component C3b receptor; complement component C4 binding protein; complement component C4a; complement component C4b; complement factor H; decay accelerating factor; major histocompatibility antigen class 3; mannose binding lectin 2; monocyte chemotactic protein; autoimmune disease; complement activation; complement component C4 binding protein gene; complement component C4a gene; complement component C4b gene; complement deficiency; complement factor H gene; complement lectin pathway; complement regulation; complement system; CR1 gene; CR2 gene; DAF gene; disease association; gene; gene cluster; gene conversion; gene function; gene identification; gene interaction; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene mutation; genetic complementation; genetic load; genetic polymorphism; genetic risk; genotype environment interaction; HLA system; host resistance; human; humoral immunity; innate immunity; intracellular signaling; MBL2 gene; MCP gene; nonhuman; priority journal; review; Animals; Complement Activation; Complement System Proteins; HLA Antigens; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; Lectins; Multigene Family; Receptors, Complement"

Organic contaminants are characterized by a variety of physical and chemical properties, including aggregation phase, concentration level, and life time. This variety widens the spectrum of procedures developed to assess their occurrence in the environment and biota, but prevents the complete speciation of the ""organic fraction"" of air, waters and particulates, and attention is paid to a few substances. The progress in health sciences stimulates the concern on contaminants and the development of new instrumental apparatuses and methods; new chemicals are continuously identified or recognized as capable of injuring the environment and organisms. Persistent organic pollutants and persistent biologically active toxicants are subject to regulation and extensively measured by means of standard procedures. For instance, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorobiphenyls and polychlorodibenzodioxins are recovered from air through phase partition, thermal desorption or solvent extraction, then separated and detected through GC-MS or HPLC-MS procedures. By contrast, dedicated methods must be still optimized to monitor candidates or possible candidates as emerging organic pollutants, e. g. phthalates, flame retardants and perfluoroalkanes. Also, psychotropic substances appear of potential concern. Legal and illicit substances are commonly detected in the urban air besides waste and surface waters. If nicotine, caffeine and cocaine will result to enough persistence in the air, their monitoring will become an important issue of global chemical watching in the next future. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","phthalic acid derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; psychotropic agent; air sampling; analytical method; atmospheric pollution; desorption; environmental assessment; environmental impact; literature review; organic pollutant; PAH; persistence; phthalate; physicochemical property; pollution monitoring; speciation (chemistry); air pollutant; atmosphere; environmental monitoring; Italy; methodology; review; Air Pollutants; Atmosphere; Environmental Monitoring; Italy; Phthalic Acids; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Psychotropic Drugs; Italy"

Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were abstracted from the studies and compared between four groups according to the neurological lesion level, cervical (C) SCI (C4-C8), high-thoracic (HT) SCI (T1-T6), low-thoracic lumbar (LTL) SCI (below T6) and able-bodied (AB) controls.Results:In the supine position, SBP, DBP and HR were lower in C compared with HT, LTL and AB (all P0.04). In the seated position, SBP and DBP were significantly lower in C compared with LTL and AB (all P0.003) and HR was significantly lower in C compared with LTL only (P0.01). A final finding was that C exhibited a lower resting SBP in the seated compared with the supine position (P0.001).Conclusion:Individuals with SCI exhibit a lesion-dependent impairment in resting CV function, whereby those with the highest injury had the greatest degree of CV dysfunction. A further finding was that individuals with a C injury exhibited a lower resting SBP in the seated vs supine position.

These perfluorinated polymer electrolytes are currently the most commercially utilized electrolyte membranes for polymer electrolyte fuel cells, with high chemical stability, proton conductivity and strong mechanical properties. While perfluorinated polymer electrolytes have satisfactory properties for fuel cell applications, they limit commercial use due to significant high costs as well as reduced performance at high temperatures and low humidity. A promising alternative to obtain high performance proton-conducting polymer electrolyte membranes is through the use of hydrocarbon polymers. The need for inexpensive and efficient materials with high thermal and chemical stability, high ionic conductivity, miscibility with other polymers, and good mechanical strength is reviewed in this paper. Though it is difficult to evaluate the true cost of a product based on preliminary research, this paper will examine several of the more promising materials available as low cost alternatives to ion exchange membranes. These alternative membranes represent a new generation of cost effective electrolytes that can be used in various ion exchange systems.

PFOA is extremely resistant to environmental degradation processes and thus persists indefinitely. Unlike most other persistent and bioaccumulative organic pollutants, PFOA is water-soluble, does not bind well to soil or sediments, and bioaccumulates in serum rather than in fat. It has been detected in finished drinking water and drinking water sources impacted by releases from industrial facilities and waste water treatment plants, as well as in waters with no known point sources. However, the overall occurrence and population exposure from drinking water is not known. PFOA persists in humans with a half-life of several years and is found in the serum of almost all U.S. residents and in populations worldwide. Exposure sources include food, food packaging, consumer products, house dust, and drinking water. Continued exposure to even relatively low concentrations in drinking water can substantially increase total human exposure, with a serum:drinking water ratio of about 100:1. For example, ongoing exposures to drinking water concentrations of 10. ng/L, 40. ng/L, 100 ng/L, or 400 ng/L are expected to increase mean serum levels by about 25%, 100%, 250%, and 1000%, respectively, from the general population background serum level of about 4. ng/mL. Infants are potentially a sensitive subpopulation for PFOA's developmental effects, and their exposure through breast milk from mothers who use contaminated drinking water and/or from formula prepared with contaminated drinking water is higher than in adults exposed to the same drinking water concentration. Numerous health endpoints are associated with human PFOA exposure in the general population, communities with contaminated drinking water, and workers. As is the case for most such epidemiology studies, causality for these effects is not proven. Unlike most other well-studied drinking water contaminants, the human dose-response curve for several effects appears to be steepest at the lower exposure levels, including the general population range, with no apparent threshold for some endpoints. There is concordance in animals and humans for some effects, while humans and animals appear to react differently for other effects such as lipid metabolism. PFOA was classified as ""likely to be carcinogenic in humans"" by the USEPA Science Advisory Board. In animal studies, developmental effects have been identified as more sensitive endpoints for toxicity than carcinogenicity or the long-established hepatic effects. Notably, exposure to an environmentally relevant drinking water concentration caused adverse effects on mammary gland development in mice. This paper reviews current information relevant to the assessment of PFOA as an emerging drinking water contaminant. This information suggests that continued human exposure to even relatively low concentrations of PFOA in drinking water results in elevated body burdens that may increase the risk of health effects. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","drinking water; perfluorooctanoate ammonium; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; uric acid; anthropogenic effect; assessment method; bioaccumulation; carcinogen; concentration (composition); drinking water; environmental degradation; epidemiology; health risk; hepatitis; literature review; metabolism; organic acid; organic pollutant; point source pollution; pollution effect; pollution exposure; water treatment; blood analysis; breast milk; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; cognition; concentration (parameters); consumer; exposure; fluorination; food packaging; house dust; human; immune system; liver; mammary gland; nonhuman; population research; priority journal; reproduction; review; toxicity testing; toxicokinetics; United States; uric acid blood level; waste water management; water contamination; water supply; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Octanoic Acids; United States; Water Pollutants, Chemical; United States; Animalia; Mus"

This paper reviews the recent literature regarding the operation-dependent emission of PN from LD vehicles and HD engines, and the measurement procedure used for regulatory purposes. The repeatability of the PN method is of the order of 5% and higher scatter of the results can easily be explained by the effect of the vehicles or the aftertreatment devices on the PN emissions (e.g., the fill state of the diesel particulate filters). Reproducibility remains an issue since it may exceed 30%. These high-variability levels are mainly associated with calibration uncertainties of the PN instruments. Correlation measurements between the full-flow dilution tunnels (constant-volume samplers, CVS) and the proportional partial-flow dilution systems (PFDS) showed agreement within 15% for the PN method down to 1 × 10 11 p/kWh. At lower concentrations, the PN background of the CVS and/or the PFDS can result in larger inconsistencies. The filter-based particulate matter (PM) mass and the PN emissions correlate well down to 1-2 mg/km for LD vehicles and to 2-3 mg/kWh for HD applications. The correlation improveswhen only elemental carbon mass is considered: it is relatively good down to 0.1-0.3 mg/km or mg/kWh.

Although experimental models of hepatic I/R injury represent a compromise between the clinical reality and experimental simplification, the clinical transfer of experimental results is problematic because of anatomical and physiological differences and the inevitable simplification of experimental work. In this review, the strengths and limitations of the various models of hepatic I/R are discussed. Several strategies to protect the liver from I/R injury have been developed in animal models and, some of these, might find their way into clinical practice. We also attempt to highlight the fact that the mechanisms responsible for hepatic I/R injury depend on the experimental model used, and therefore the therapeutic strategies also differ according to the model used. Thus, the choice of model must therefore be adapted to the clinical question being answered. Copyright © 2012 M.

Attention has mostly been focused on T-cell-mediated cellular mechanisms of allograft rejection to explain these losses; however, as in other forms of solid-organ transplantation, especially kidney and heart, antibody-mediated mechanisms of acute and chronic allograft injury are increasingly being implicated. In this review, the mechanisms of B-cell- and humoral-mediated allograft injury will be briefly discussed along with the limited evidence that exist for invoking antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) as important in intestine transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: The presence of donor-specific antibody has been reported to increase the incidence and severity of intestine allograft rejection and to worsen the overall prognosis for graft and patient. C4d staining in intestine biopsies is unreliable, and currently it is not possible to diagnose AMR with certainty in intestine transplantation. Treatment of presumed AMR in intestine recipients is purely anecdotal at this time.

Two distinct analysis tools were employed. First, Reaxys ® was employed to examine the versatility and occurrences of R FI in 1356 non-polymeric synthetic transformations. The most common R FI synthetic conversions were (i) free-radical addition to carbon-carbon double or triple bonds, (ii) coupling to aryl halides, and (iii) Grignard, organolithium, or similar R F anion addition to ketones and aldehydes. R FI were also used as a chain transfer reagent in free-radical polymerization reactions of fluorinated and other unsaturated monomers. Second, a complementary Chemical Abstracts' STN AnaVist ® search was employed to summarize the 779 publications describing reaction products that contained n-perfluoroalkyl chains (C nF 2n+1-, where n = 2-4).

Long-term human studies on effects of environmental chemicals on thyroid related outcomes such as growth and development are still lacking. The human exposure scenario with life long exposure to a vast mixture of chemicals in low doses and the large physiological variation in thyroid hormone levels between individuals render human studies very difficult.

The different systems make adaptations based on natural selection. With respect to the immune system of mammals, these changes have a lot to do with the interactions that occur continuously with other living species, especially microorganisms. The immune system is primarily designed to defend from germs and this response triggers inflammatory reactions which must be regulated in order not to generate damage to healthy tissue. The regulatory processes were added over time to prevent such damage. Through evolution the species have stored an immunological experience, which provides information that is important for developing effective responses in the future. The human species, which is at a high level of evolutionary immunological accumulation, have multiple immune defense strategies which, in turn, are highly regulated.

Perfluorinated molecules exhibit novel physicochemical properties that include extreme chemical inertness, thermal stability, and an unusual propensity for phase segregation. The question we and others have sought to answer is to what extent can these properties be engineered into proteins? Here, we review recent studies in which proteins have been designed that incorporate highly fluorinated analogs of hydrophobic amino acids with the aim of creating proteins with novel chemical and biological properties. Fluorination seems to be a general and effective strategy to enhance the stability of proteins, both soluble and membrane bound, against chemical and thermal denaturation, although retaining structure and biological activity. Most studies have focused on small proteins that can be produced by peptide synthesis as synthesis of large proteins containing specifically fluorinated residues remains challenging. However, the development of various biosynthetic methods for introducing noncanonical amino acids into proteins promises to expand the utility of fluorinated amino acids in protein design. © 2012 The Protein Society.","fluorine; fluorocarbon; glucagon like peptide 1; leucine; perfluoro compound; transcription factor GCN4; bacterial strain; fluorination; glucose homeostasis; human; hydrophobicity; isothermal titration calorimetry; Klebsiella pneumoniae; ligand binding; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; peptide synthesis; physical chemistry; priority journal; protein denaturation; protein engineering; protein nucleic acid interaction; protein protein interaction; protein stability; protein structure; protein synthesis; protein unfolding; review; Staphylococcus aureus; thermostability; Amino Acids; Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic; Fluorine; Fluorocarbons; Halogenation; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Models, Molecular; Physicochemical Processes; Protein Engineering; Protein Folding; Protein Interaction Mapping; Protein Stability; Proteins; Solubility; Thermodynamics"

High concentrations of Tl that are primarily associated with the epithermal metallogenesis of sulfide minerals have the potential of producing Tl pollution in the environment, which has been recognized as an emerging pollutant in China. This paper aims to review the research progress in China on Tl pollution in terms of the source, mobility, transportation pathway, and health exposure of Tl and to address the environmental concerns on Tl pollution in a geo-environmental perspective. Tl associated with the epithermal metallogenesis of sulfide minerals has been documented to disperse readily and accumulate through the geo-environmental processes of soil enrichment, water transportation and food crop growth beyond a mineralized zone. The enrichments of Tl in local soil, water, and crops may result in Tl pollution and consequent adverse health effects, e.g. chronic Tl poisoning. Investigation of the baseline Tl in the geo-environment, proper land use and health-related environmental planning and regulation are critical to prevent the Tl pollution. Examination of the human urinary Tl concentration is a quick approach to identify exposure of Tl pollution to humans. The experiences of Tl pollution in China can provide important lessons for many other regions in the world with similar geo-environmental contexts because of the high mobility and toxicity of Tl. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Adverse health effects; China; Emerging pollutants; Environmental concerns; Environmental planning; Epithermal; Food crops; Geo-environment; Health impact; High concentration; High mobility; Human health; Metallogenesis; Mineralized zone; Quick approach; Research progress; Soil enrichment; Toxic metals; Water transportation; Crops; Health; Pollution; Sulfide minerals; Thallium; Soil pollution; sulfide; thallium; concentration (composition); health impact; metallogenesis; mobility; poisoning; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; soil pollution; sulfide; thallium; toxicity; water pollution; atmospheric deposition; bioaccumulation; China; crop production; environmental enrichment; environmental exposure; environmental planning; health hazard; human; pollution; priority journal; review; soil pollution; urinalysis; water transport; China; Environmental Health; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Forecasting; Sulfides; Thallium; China"

Recently, Brillouin scattering, which is one of the most significant nonlinear effects in optical fibers, has been successfully observed in PFGI-POFs at 1.55-μm wavelength. The Brillouin Stokes signal was, however, not large enough for practical applications or for detailed investigations of the Brillouin properties. In this paper, we review our recent work on Stokes signal enhancement. First, we induce stimulated Brillouin scattering based on the so-called pump-probe technique, and discuss its applicability to temperature sensors. Then, we investigate the influence of the core diameter and length of PFGI-POFs on Stokes signal, and observe the Brillouin linewidth narrowing effect. We believe our work is an important technological step toward the implementation of practical Brillouin-based devices and systems including distributed strain and temperature sensors. © 2014 by the authors.",

Efforts to immunize in the first weeks of life, in various species, have had limited success in general. This has been attributed to a combination of immaturity of the neonatal immune system and interference by maternal antibodies. Most studies of neonatal immune responsiveness have been carried out in neonatal mice, or by examination of cellular components of human umbilical cord blood. Both approaches have their limitations. The current review describes factors, including corticosteroids, complement proteins, cytokines, maternal lymphocytes and antibodies, which may influence immune responses of neonates, comparing data from studies of domestic animals and humans. Neonates are highly dependent on passive (maternal) antibodies for protection against a wide range of pathogens. These maternal antibodies have been noted to interfere with active immune responses to many, but not all, vaccines. Various theories have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including epitope masking, clearance of immune complexes and FcγRII mediated regulation of B cells. Remarkably, many studies examining the effects of passive antibodies on immune responses of adults, have demonstrated immune enhancing effects. The evidence for enhancing and suppressive effects of passive antibodies on antigen uptake, processing and regulation of lymphocyte responses is reviewed. Since maternal antibodies (as present in neonates) differ in subisotypes and affinity from the passive antibodies often used in experimental systems, here is a need for better experimental models investigating the effects of bona fide maternal antibodies on immune responses of neonates (not adult surrogates). Vaccines can be optimized for use in neonates - by making better use of existing vaccine technologies and by harnessing the potential of recent immunological and technological advances. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","bovine viral diarrhea vaccine; complement component C3; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; corticosteroid; CpG oligodeoxynucleotide; DNA vaccine; epitope; gamma interferon; glucocorticoid receptor; hydrocortisone; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; live vaccine; maternal antibody; measles vaccine; pertussis vaccine; phosphorothioic acid; retinol; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; virus vaccine; antibody response; B lymphocyte; Bovine diarrhea virus; bovine viral diarrhea; cellular immunity; colostrum; dendritic cell; domestic animal; erythrocyte; human; hydrocortisone blood level; immune response; immunoregulation; measles; measles vaccination; neonate vaccination; nonhuman; passive immunization; pertussis; priority journal; protein expression; review; T lymphocyte; umbilical cord blood; vaccination; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Animals; Animals, Newborn; B-Lymphocytes; Cytokines; Humans; Immunity, Active; Immunity, Maternally-Acquired; Immunocompetence; Infant, Newborn; Vaccination; Vaccines"

In the last years, asymmetric domino reactions have widely benefited from this fast-growing field, as exemplified by the development of an explosive number of novel and powerful asymmetric organocatalytic domino processes, which allowed the easy construction of complex chiral molecular architectures from simple materials with high yields and very often remarkable enantioselectivities in a metal-free environment. Indeed, the possibility to join two or more organocatalytic reactions in one asymmetric domino process has become a challenging goal for chemists, due to several advantages from economical and environmental points of view, avoiding costly protecting groups and time-consuming purification procedures after each step, for example.

PIM kinases are overexpressed in several hematopoietic tumors and support in vitro and in vivo malignant cell growth and survival, through cell cycle regulation and inhibition of apoptosis. PIM kinases do not have an identified regulatory domain, which means that these proteins are constitutively active once transcribed. They appear to be critical downstream effectors of important oncoproteins and, when overexpressed, can mediate drug resistance to available agents, such as rapamycin. Recent crystallography studies reveal that, unlike other kinases, they possess a hinge region, which creates a unique binding pocket for ATP, offering a target for an increasing number of potent small-molecule PIM kinase inhibitors. Preclinical studies in models of various hematologic cancers indicate that these novel agents show promising activity and some of them are currently being evaluated in a clinical setting.

In this review, toxicokinetic data of PFCAs (chain lengths ranging from 4 to 10) in different species are compared with an emphasis on their relevance to renal elimination. PFCAs vary in their affinities to bind to serum albumins in plasma, which is an important factor in determining the renal clearance of PFCAs. PFCA-albumin binding has been well characterized and is summarized in this review. The mechanism of the sex-, species-, and chain length-dependent renal PFCA elimination is a research area that has gained continuous interest since the beginning of toxicological studies of PFCAs. It is now recognized that organic anion transport proteins play a key role in PFCA renal tubular reabsorption, a process that is sex-, species-, and chain length-dependent. Recent studies on the identification of PFCA renal transport proteins and characterization of their transport kinetics have greatly improved our understanding of the PFCA renal transport mechanism at the molecular level. A mathematical representation of this renal tubular reabsorption mechanism has been incorporated in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Improvement of PBPK models in the future will require more accurate and quantitative characterization of renal transport pathways of PFCAs. To that end, a basolateral membrane efflux pathway for the reabsorption of PFCAs in the kidney is discussed in this review, which could provide a future research direction toward a better understanding of the mechanisms of PFCA renal elimination. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","haloacid; perfluorocarboxylic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; serum albumin; unclassified drug; binding affinity; drug elimination; drug protein binding; human; kidney clearance; kidney tubule absorption; nonhuman; review; sex difference; species comparison; toxicokinetics; Animals; Carboxylic Acids; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Kidney; Models, Biological; Octanoic Acids; Mammalia"

The term ""emerging pollutants"" stands for the substances that are released in the environment for which currently no regulations are established for their environmental monitoring. Their occurrence is reported worldwide in a range of aquatic environments, such as lakes, rivers, freshwater catchments, estuaries, reservoirs and marine waters. Nevertheless, due to their large number (ranging in an order of thousands), only few of these compounds are toxicologically evaluated. Published data concerning occurrence and potential toxicological effects is limited. The contamination source of the aquatic environment is mainly the effluents from the sewage treatment plants (STPs). Reliable methods are available for residue analysis of these pollutants down to low ng L-1 levels. However, an urgent need is highlighted for the investigation (primarily in environmental media and following in biological ones) of the toxicity and transformation pathways of all emerging pollutants. The aims of this mini-review are to briefly present: (a) the major classes of emerging pollutants; (b) the reasons why these substances constitute an environmental issue; and (c) developments and applications of environmental analysis in this field. © 2012 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

FTS is often seen in sports that emphasize thinness (e.g. gymnastics, figure skating and dancing) and also in endurance events. Elements of the FTS are pathophysiologically linked, leading to several disease risks and even to mortality. In spite of the considerable knowledge about sports nutrition, there is no consensus as to the correct nutrition regime for the female athlete. There is consensus that minimizing fluctuations in 'target-body-weight' is an indication of a long-term energy balance. Female athletes (e.g. in endurance events and gymnastics) are less likely to achieve the recommended carbohydrates (CHO) and fat consumption due to chronic or episodic constraints of total energy intake while struggling to achieve or maintain low levels of body fat. It is recommended that dietary CHO and fat content be increased to preserve fat-free mass thus enhancing health and performance. Energy balance should also be maintained during recesses. Furthermore, within-day episodes of energy deficits/surplus (measured by the frequency and/or magnitude of the episodes) should be monitored and treated closest to the time of the incidents.","athlete; body composition; caloric intake; endurance; female; female athlete triad; human; nutritional assessment; nutritional requirement; pathophysiology; physiology; prevalence; review; Athletes; Body Composition; Energy Intake; Female; Female Athlete Triad Syndrome; Humans; Nutrition Assessment; Nutritional Requirements; Physical Endurance; Prevalence"

Many countries have investigated and tried to implement various countermea-sures in response to this decision. In this article, we collect reports concerning regulations and risk evaluations of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and review the current PFC management practiced in various countries. The first part of this review contains a comprehensive collection of proposed standard PFC values, including provisional tolerable daily intakes (pTDI), drinking water guidelines, and predicted non-effect concentrations (PNEC). The pTDI values ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 μg/kg/day for PFOS, and there are wide margins of safety for adults. Health risks for plant workers exposed to PFCs and for infants are of particular concern. The application of these proposed values in controlling PFC pollution is one approach that may effectively control human health risk without unduly sacrificing the benefits from PFC use. The second part of this review contains a collection and review of a number of regulations and countermeasures, such as an EU directive, regulation in Canada, and the Significant New Use Rule (SNUR), including voluntary control (i.e., production phase-out by 3M, stewardship programs, regulation in the semiconductor industry). Most of these regulations are based principally on the precautionary principle. However, they may not be as effective in pollution reduction as intended because the chemicals in question are already widely distributed in the environment owing to their use and mobility in the environment. In addition, these types of regulations would be non-operative in developing countries because rapidly growing economies place great demand on high performance materials, including PFCs. Further development of risk assessment methods that allow the evaluation of the counter risks of PFC alternatives and the loss of benefits from the PFC ban is necessary because of the possible continuous use of PFCs, especially in developing countries. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Developing countries; Health risks; Management; Organic chemicals; Organic pollutants; Pollution control; Potable water; Semiconductor device manufacture; Guideline; High performance material; Perfluorinated compound (PFCs); Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Persistent organic pollutants; Regulation; Risk assessment and managements; Significant new use rules; Risk assessment"

This peculiar pattern of dissociated atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles is termed the 'split hand' and is rarely seen in diseases other than ALS. The muscles involved in the split hand are innervated through the same spinal segments (C8 and T1), and FDI and ADM, which are differentially affected, are both ulnar nerve innervated. The physiological mechanisms underlying the split hand in ALS are incompletely understood but both cortical and spinal/peripheral mechanisms are probably involved. Motor potentials evoked by magnetic stimulation are significantly smaller when recorded from the thenar complex, compared with the hypothenar muscles, supporting a cortical mechanism. But peripheral axonal excitability studies have suggested that APB/FDI motor axons have more prominent persistent sodium currents than ADM axons, leading to higher axonal excitability and thereby more ready degeneration. Pincer or precision grip is vital to human hand function, and frequent use of thenar complex muscles may lead to greater oxidative stress and metabolic demands at both upper and lower motoneurons innervating the APB and FDI. The split hand is a useful diagnostic sign in early ALS, and recent objective studies indicate that the sign has a high degree of specificity.","amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ectrodactyly; evoked muscle response; grip strength; human; motoneuron; muscle innervation; nerve cell excitability; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; patient assessment; priority journal; review; sensitivity and specificity; sodium current"

A recent study on pregnant women suggested that PFC exposure was associated with a longer time to pregnancy (TTP). We examined the association between serum concentrations of PFCs in females and TTP in 222 Danish first-time pregnancy planners during the years 19921995.Methods The couples were enrolled in the study when discontinuing birth control and followed for six menstrual cycles or until a clinically recognized pregnancy occurred. Fecundability ratio (FR) was calculated using discrete-time survival models. In addition, odds ratio (OR) for TTP >6 cycles was calculated. Results OR for TTP >6 cycles for those with PFC concentrations above the median were 0.96 [95 confidence interval (CI): 0.541.64] for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), the major PFC, compared with those below the median. FRs for those with PFOS concentrations above the median were 1.05 (95 CI: 0.741.48) compared with those below the median. Other PFCs showed the same lack of association with TTP. The results were not affected by adjustment for covariates. PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid concentrations were similar to those observed in a previous Danish study. Conclusions These findings suggest that exposure to PFCs affects TTP only to a small extent, if at all. © 2012 The Author.","perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; adult; birth control; blood level; cohort analysis; conception; confidence interval; controlled study; Denmark; female; human; human experiment; menstrual cycle; normal human; primigravida; prospective study; review; risk; survival"

Genetic susceptibility to TB in HIV negative subjects is well documented. Since coinfections can influence the way in which immune system respond to different pathogens, genetic susceptibility to TB in HIV patients might also change. Studies from India and other parts of the world have shown that genetic susceptibility to TB is influenced by HIV infection. In the present review, we emphasize the role of genetic factors in determining susceptibility to HIV infection, disease progression and development of TB in HIV-infected patients. Polymorphisms in human leukocyte antigen (HLA), MBL2, CD209, vitamin D receptor, cytokine, chemokine and chemokine receptor genes have been shown to be associated with development of TB in HIV patients. However, the results are inconclusive and larger well-defined studies with precise clinical data are required to validate these associations. Apart from candidate gene approach, genome-wide association studies are also needed to unravel the unknown or to establish the previously reported genetic associations with HIV associated TB. Despite the preliminary status of the reported associations, it is becoming clear that susceptibility to development of TB in HIV patients is influenced by both environmental and genetic components. Understanding the genetic and immunologic factors that influence susceptibility to TB in HIV patients could lead to novel insights for vaccine development as well as diagnostic advances to target treatment to those who are at risk for developing active disease. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Physiological and pathophysiological stimuli suchas cytokines, growth factors, receptor and integrin activation, contractile agonists,ions, and reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the positive regulation ofTonEBP expression and activity in diverse cell types. These new data demonstratethat tonicity-independent stimulation of TonEBP is critical for tissue-specificfunctions like enhanced cell survival, migration, proliferation, vascular remodeling,carcinoma invasion, and angiogenesis.

Modification of the fluorous content and position of the fluorous tails in the aryl groups of the phosphines have allowed for further optimization of the process and a better recovery of the catalyst with minimal leaching of rhodium and fluorous ligand to the organic phase. Moreover, the use of the so-called second generation methods which eliminate the need of fluorous solvents by exploiting the temperature-dependent solubilities of fluorous catalysts in common organic solvents (thermomorphic properties) have permitted the use and separation of fluorous alkyl-phosphine rhodium catalysts in hydrosilylation reactions in conventional organic solvents. The addition of an insoluble fluorous support such as Teflon tape allowed for an exceptionally easy and efficient recovery of fluorous rhodium catalysts (""catalyst-on-a- tape"") in the hydrosilylation of ketones. In the case of the FBS gold-catalyzed hydrosilylation of aldehydes, new fluorous gold catalysts with alkylic phosphines have led to an efficient separation and recycling of the gold catalysts although the TON/TOF are lower than in the rhodium-catalyzed hydrosilylation of alkenes and ketones. A detailed study of the non-fluorous gold-catalyzed version has helped to explain how this catalytic system could be improved. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

International consensus recommends the use of statins as the first line of treatment for patients with this condition. However, homozygote FH patients with persistently elevated LDL-C levels are usually resistant to multiple-drug therapy. Fortunately, LDL apheresis (or simply 'lipoprotein apheresis') provides a treatment option for patients who are refractory or intolerant to lipid-lowering medications, or if there is progressive cardiovascular disease despite maximal drug therapy.Lipoprotein apheresis is an extracorporeal LDL-C-lowering treatment similar in concept to renal dialysis. There are now five main methods for extracorporeal lipoprotein apheresis in use, namely dextran sulfate adsorption (DSA), heparin extracorporeal LDL precipitation (HELP), polyacrylate full blood adsorption (PFBA or DALI® system) using hemoperfusion, immunoadsorption, and filtration plasmapheresis.Lipoprotein apheresis has been shown to be successful in reducing LDL-C levels, as well as levels of lipoprotein(a) Lp(a), a prothrombotic proatherogenic lipoprotein. In contrast, however, lipoprotein apheresis seems to have a smaller effect in preventing atherosclerosis progression, thus suggesting that a major component of the reduction in cardiovascular events may be mediated by mitigating Lp(a) levels. Side effects are infrequent and mild, and have mainly consisted of lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. As these are often bradykinin-mediated and associated with concomitant ACE inhibitor use, angiotensin type 2 receptor antagonists should be used instead of ACE inhibitors with DALI and PFBA. Nevertheless, there is scope for wider application of lipoprotein apheresis.The high cost and invasive nature of lipoprotein apheresis limits uptake; however, it is an important treatment modality that should be considered in carefully selected patients. National and international registries compiling outcome data for lipoprotein apheresis need to be established to help expand the evidence base regarding its effectiveness. © 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

Study of inter-specific variation in the FTs of plants aids in classifying species into plant functional types (PFTs) and provides insights into fundamental patterns and trade-offs in plant form and functioning and the effect of changing species composition on ecosystem functions. Specifically, this paper focuses on those FTs that make a species successful in the dry tropical environment. Following a brief overview, we discuss plant FTs that may be particularly relevant to tropical deciduous forests (TDFs). We consider the traits under the following categories: leaf traits, stem and root traits, reproductive traits, and traits particularly relevant to water availability. We compile quantitative information on functional traits of dry tropical forest species. We also discuss trait-based grouping of plants into PFTs. We recognize that there is incomplete knowledge about many FTs and their effects on TDFs and point out the need for further research on PFTs of TDF species, which can enable prediction of the dynamics of these forests in the face of disturbance and global climate change. Correlations between structural and ecophysiological traits and ecosystem functioning should also be established which could make it possible to generate predictions of changes in ecosystem services from changes in functional composition. © Indian Academy of Sciences.","autecology; deciduous forest; ecophysiology; ecosystem function; environmental change; environmental effect; environmental factor; functional morphology; interspecific variation; plant; quantitative analysis; research work; tropical forest; biodiversity; climate change; forest; forest dynamics; functional trait; interspecific variation; moisture; nonhuman; plant evolution; plant leaf; plant reproduction; plant root; plant stem; plant structures; review; seasonal variation; species composition; species differentiation; tree; tropical deciduous forest; water availability; ecosystem; physiology; reproduction; species difference; tree; tropic climate; Ecosystem; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Plant Stems; Reproduction; Species Specificity; Trees; Tropical Climate"

PFCs are molecules made up of carbon chains to which fluorine atoms are bound. Due to the strength of the carbon/fluorine bond, the molecules are chemically very stable and are highly resistant to biological degradation; therefore, they belong to a class of compounds that tend to persist in the environment. These compounds can bioaccumulate and also undergo biomagnification. Within the class of PFC chemicals, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorosulphonic acid are generally considered reference substances. Meanwhile, PFCs can be detected almost ubiquitously, e.g., in water, plants, different kinds of foodstuffs, in animals such as fish, birds, in mammals, as well as in human breast milk and blood. PFCs are proposed as a new class of 'persistent organic pollutants'. Numerous publications allude to the negative effects of PFCs on human health. The following review describes both external and internal exposures to PFCs, the toxicokinetics (uptake, distribution, metabolism, excretion), and the toxicodynamics (acute toxicity, subacute and subchronic toxicities, chronic toxicity including carcinogenesis, genotoxicity and epigenetic effects, reproductive and developmental toxicities, neurotoxicity, effects on the endocrine system, immunotoxicity and potential modes of action, combinational effects, and epidemiological studies on perfluorinated compounds). © 2011 Stahl et al.","Animalia; Aves; Mammalia"

Testosterone and its metabolically activated product dihydrotestosterone are critical for the development of male reproductive system and spermatogenesis. At least four steroidogenic enzymes are involved in testosterone biosynthesis: Cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1) for the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone within the mitochondria, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B), for the conversion of pregnenolone into progesterone, 17a-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1) for the conversion of progesterone into androstenedione and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD17B3) for the formation of testosterone from androstenedione. Testosterone is also metabolically activated into more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone by two isoforms 5a-reductase 1 (SRD5A1) and 2 (SRD5A2) in Leydig cells and peripheral tissues. Many endocrine disruptors act as antiandrogens via directly inhibiting one or more enzymes for testosterone biosynthesis and metabolic activation. These chemicals include industrial materials (perfluoroalkyl compounds, phthalates, bisphenol A and benzophenone) and pesticides/biocides (methoxychlor, organotins, 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane and prochloraz) and plant constituents (genistein and gossypol).

At present, many prominent groups are dedicating significant resources to tailoring and optimising the performance of potential contrast agents. Whilst 1H MRI has become an indispensable tool for the imaging of disease states, it frequently suffers from low contrast owing to background signal from intrinsic 1H. As a result, increasing attention is being directed at compounds containing 19F as this nucleus has a similar NMR sensitivity to 1H and, importantly, intrinsic 19F signals are virtually undetectable in vivo. For several decades, perfluorinated molecules (in which all of the C-H bonds in the parent molecule have been replaced with C-F bonds) and highly fluorous gases such as SF 6 have traditionally been used for these kinds of investigations and there have been some excellent reviews of these compounds and their applications. However, recently 19F imaging is showing signs of evolution, particularly as there have been several reports of fluorinated responsive (smart) agents, micelles, dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers being investigated as targets for 19F-MRI. Furthermore, examples of multimodal contrast agents containing 19F nuclei are also starting to emerge.

Type C isolates must produce at least beta toxin (CPB) and alpha toxin (CPA) and most strains produce several other toxins including perfringolysin O (PFO) and TpeL. However, current evidence indicates that CPB is the main virulence factor for type C infections. Most of this evidence is based upon the loss of virulence shown by isogenic type C CPB knock out mutants on cells, and also in rabbit intestinal loops and in mouse models. This virulence is regained when these mutants are complemented with the wild-type cpb gene. Many type C isolates respond to close contact with enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells by producing all toxins, except TpeL, much more rapidly than occurs during in vitro growth. This in vivo effect involves rapid transcriptional upregulation of the cpb, cpb2, pfoA and plc toxin genes. Rapid Caco-2 cell-induced upregulation of CPB and PFO production involves the VirS/VirR two-component system, since upregulated in vivo transcription of the pfoA and cpb genes was blocked by inactivating the virR gene and was reversible by complementation to restore VirR expression. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..","clostridium perfringens toxin; Clostridium toxin; TpeL toxin; unclassified drug; amino acid sequence; bacterial virulence; cell strain CACO 2; Clostridium perfringens; Clostridium perfringens infection; human; in vitro study; necrotizing enteritis; nonhuman; pathogenesis; review; thermostability; upregulation; wild type; Animals; Bacterial Toxins; Clostridium Infections; Clostridium perfringens; Gastroenteritis; Humans; Mice; Rabbits; Virulence; Virulence Factors; Animalia; Clostridium perfringens; Oryctolagus cuniculus"

The requirements for such membranes are also summarized. Then, different strategies are given to synthesize anion-exchange polymeric materials containing cationic (especially ammonium) groups. The first pathway focuses on heterogeneous membranes that consist in: (i) polymer blends and composites based on poly(alkene oxide)s and hydroxide salts or polybenzimidazole doped with potassium hydroxide, (ii) organic-inorganic hybrid membranes especially those synthesized via a sol-gel process, and (iii) (semi)interpenetrated networks based on poly(epichlorhydrine), poly(acrylonitrile) and polyvinyl alcohol for example, that have led to new polymeric materials for anion-exchange membranes. The second and main part concerns the homogeneous membranes divided into three categories. The first one consists in materials synthesized from (co)polymers obtained via direct (co)polymerization, for example membranes based on poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride). The second pathway concerns the modification of polymeric materials via radiografting or chemical reactions. These polymeric materials can be hydrogenated or halogenated. The radiografting of membranes means the irradiation via various sources - electron beam, X and γ rays, 60Co and 137Cs that lead to trapped radicals or macromolecular peroxides or hydroperoxides, followed by the radical graft polymerization of specific monomers such as chloromethyl styrene. The third route deals with the chemical modifications of commercially available hydrogenated aliphatic and aromatic (co)polymers, and the syntheses of fluorinated (co)polymers such as carboxylic and sulfonic perfluoropolymers. In addition, several approaches for the crosslinking of above-mentioned polymeric materials are also reported as this process enhances the properties of the resulting membranes.

They illustrate the government's claim to decentralization, by granting greater autonomy to high performing organizations. The number of FTs has grown steadily, reaching 131 in September 2010, over 50% of eligible trusts. Despite this growth, and notwithstanding the fact that organizations which initially became FTs were previously high performing, doubts remain about the implementation of the FT policy. This article examines the implementation of FTs in the NHS and focuses on the nature and exercise of autonomy by FTs. It argues that the ability of FTs to exercise autonomy is in place, but the (relatively limited) extent of implementation may be explained by trusts' lack of willingness to exercise such autonomy. Such unwillingness may be because of continued centralization, unclear policy and financial regimes, fear of negative impacts on relations with other local organizations, and awareness of greater risk to the FT, among others. Addressing the tension between FTs' ability and willingness to exercise autonomy will largely explain the extent to which the government's provider side reforms will be implemented. © The Royal Society of Medicine Press Ltd 2011.","financial management; government; health care delivery; health care organization; health care policy; national health service; priority journal; review; trust; England; Foundations; Health Care Reform; Humans; Metaphor; Professional Autonomy; State Medicine"

A wider range of geographical locations (e.g., South America, Russia, Antarctica) and habitats (e.g., high-mountain lakes, deep-ocean, and offshore waters) have been investigated in recent years enabling a better understanding of the global distribution of PFCs in aquatic organisms. High concentrations of PFCs continue to be detected in invertebrates, fish, reptiles, and marine mammals worldwide. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is still the predominant PFC detected (mean concentrations up to 1900 ng/g ww) in addition to important concentrations of long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs; sum PFCAs up to 400 ng/g ww). More studies have evaluated the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of these compounds in both freshwater and marine food webs. Several reports have indicated a decrease in PFOS levels over time in contrast to PFCA concentrations that have tended to increase in tissues of aquatic organisms at many locations. The detection of precursor metabolites and isomers has become more frequently reported in environmental assessments yielding important information on the sources and distribution of these contaminants. The integration of environmental/ecological characteristics (e.g., latitude/longitude, salinity, and/or trophic status at sampling locations) and biological variables (e.g., age, gender, life cycle, migration, diet composition, growth rate, food chain length, metabolism, and elimination) are essential elements in order to adequately study the environmental fate and distribution of PFCs and should be more frequently considered in study design. © Published 2011 by the American Chemical Society.","Antarctica; Aquatic biota; Aquatic ecosystem; Aquatic organisms; Biological monitoring; Biological variables; Biomagnification; Critical review; Environmental assessment; Environmental fate; Essential elements; Geographical locations; Global distribution; High concentration; Marine food web; Marine mammals; Mean concentrations; Offshore water; Perfluorinated compounds; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Sampling location; South America; Study design; Trophic status; Biochemistry; Carboxylation; Ecosystems; Geographical distribution; Isomers; Mammals; Metabolism; Tissue; Chemical contamination; carboxylic acid derivative; fresh water; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl carboxylate; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; unclassified drug; bioaccumulation; dose-response relationship; environmental assessment; environmental fate; fish; food web; freshwater ecosystem; invertebrate; literature review; marine ecosystem; marine mammal; metabolite; pollutant transport; reptile; age distribution; Antarctica; aquatic environment; aquatic species; bioaccumulation; dietary intake; elimination reaction; environmental monitoring; fish; follow up; food chain; geographic distribution; growth rate; invertebrate; lake; latitude; life cycle; marine biology; metabolism; migration; nonhuman; reptile; review; Russian Federation; salinity; sea; sex difference; South America; trophic cascade; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Biota; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution; Antarctica; Russian Federation; South America; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Reptilia"

Awassi, a common FTS breed in many Mediterranean countries, is adaptive and suitable to live in harsh conditions of the arid and semiarid areas. One of the main constraints for sheep industry in those areas is the limited supply and variable quality and quantity of feedstuffs. Using several alternative feedstuffs (AF) has been a common practice to decrease production cost of Awassi sheep industry in those areas. The appropriate AF to be used is determined by several animal and feed factors. These AF includes, but not limited to, unconventional feedstuffs, agricultural byproducts, and agro-industrial byproducts. A good body of literature about the use of AF and the effects of such use on performance of Awassi sheep is available. Some of these AF have been shown to be safely used in Awassi diets with no detrimental effects on sheep performance or health and, thus, recommended to lower the production cost. Other AF has controversial effects and recommendations. This paper reviews the effects of using AF on performance of Awassi ewes and lambs. Effects on intake, nutrient digestibilities, growth rate, and carcass characteristics of lambs and on intake, nutrient digestibilities, body weight change, milk yield, and milk composition of ewes will be emphasized. Recommendations and limitations for using AF will also be briefly discussed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","animal; animal food; body weight; chemistry; eating; economics; growth, development and aging; meat; milk; physiology; review; sheep; Animal Feed; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Body Weight; Eating; Meat; Milk; Sheep, Domestic; Animalia; Ovis aries"

To prevent this contamination, several processes to degrade/remove antibiotics have been studied. This review addresses the current state of knowledge concerning the input sources, occurrence and mainly the degradation and removal processes applied to a specific class of micropollutants, the antibiotics. In this paper, different remediation techniques were evaluated and compared, such as conventional techniques (biological processes, filtration, coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation), advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), adsorption, membrane processes and combined methods. In this study, it was found that ozonation, Fenton/photo-Fenton and semiconductor photocatalysis were the most tested methodologies.

C1 to C4 PAE are used in non-vinyl commercial products and pharmaceuticals. C8 to C10 PAE are additives imparting flexibility to vinyl resins. The purpose of the present study is to assess chronic effects of PAE on aquatic organisms. Studies show that populations of fish and invertebrates may be adversely affected by exposure to C1 to C4 PAE, but are not adversely affected by exposure to C8 or higher PAE. Secondary endpoints, including molecular, biochemical, and/or histological responses to chemical exposure, do not appear to predict effects related to primary endpoints of survival, growth and development, or reproductive fitness. A previously published risk assessment for C1 to C4 PAE demonstrated low risks in North American and Western European surface waters. Risk assessments conducted by authorities in Europe with di-2-ethylhexyl-, di-isononyl-, and di-isodecyl phthalates have concluded no risks to aquatic organisms due to aqueous solubility constraints, low expected surface water concentrations, and metabolic biotransformation capabilities of aquatic organisms.

The emergence of the composite implant offers the stability and strength of traditional titanium mesh, while the porous polyethylene shell allows for greater fibrovascular integration and a potential for decreased risk of postoperative complications. Development of copolymers and biomechanical constructs for the delivery of bone stimulating proteins and stem cells serve to restore orbital volume after fracture repair through stimulation of the patient's own tissue. These recent developments are promising; however, their safety and efficacy have not been verified in humans.

The close structural similarities lead to physico-chemical properties and environmental fate characteristics which follow a regular pattern and justify the applied read-across within a category approach. Common physical and/or biological properties result in structurally similar breakdown products and are, together with the surfactant properties, responsible for similar environmental behavior. The structural similarities result in the same mode of ecotoxic action. Within each of the three sub-categories of ANS the most important parameter influencing ecotoxicity is the varying length of the alkyl chain. Although the counter-ion may also influence the physico-chemical properties, there is no indication that it significantly affects chemical reactivity, environmental fate and behavior or ecotoxicity of these chemicals.Deduced from physico-chemical and surfactancy properties, the main target compartment for the substances of the ANS category is the hydrosphere. They are quantitatively removed in waste water treatment plants, mainly by biodegradation. Quantitative removal in biological treatment plants is reflected by low AS concentrations measured in effluents of waste water treatment plants (mostly below 10μg/L). In addition, bioaccumulation of ANS does not exceed regulatory triggers based upon experimental data.A considerable number of reliable aquatic toxicity data for the whole ANS category are available, including chronic and subchronic data for species of all trophic levels.Based upon the highest quality data in hand, there appears to be no singularly most sensitive trophic level in tests on the toxicity of alkyl sulfates, with a large degree of overlap among algae, invertebrates and fish. Algae proved to be more variable in sensitivity to alkyl sulfate exposure compared to fish and daphnia. The key study for the aquatic hazard assessment is a chronic test on Ceriodaphnia dubia, which covers a range of the alkyl chain length from C12 to C18. A parabolic response was observed, with the C14 chain length being the most toxic (7d-NOEC=0.045mg/L). Responses of aquatic communities to C12 AS and C14-15 AS have been studied in high quality stream mesocosm studies containing a broad range of species and ecological interactions. These studies are regarded as a better approximation to reality when extrapolating to the environment. The 56-d chronic NOEC for C12 AS and C14-15 AS were 0.224 and 0.106mg/L, respectively, based on integrated assessments of periphyton (algal, bacterial and protozoan) and invertebrate communities.Taking into account the rapid biodegradation of the ANS compounds as well as the low concentrations measured in different environmental compartments, this category of surfactants is of low concern for the environment. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","aliphatic hydrocarbon; alkanesulfonic acid; alkenesulfonic acid; anionic surfactant; sulfate; aliphatic hydrocarbon; bioaccumulation; biodegradation; ecotoxicology; environmental fate; environmental hazard; hazard assessment; hydrophobicity; physicochemical property; surfactant; alga; bioaccumulation; biodegradation; chemical structure; concentration (parameters); Daphnia; ecotoxicity; environmental impact; fish; hazard assessment; hydrophobicity; hydrosphere; invertebrate; mesocosm; nonhuman; periphyton; physical chemistry; quantitative analysis; review; waste component removal; waste water treatment plant; water contamination; Animals; Anions; Aquatic Organisms; Biodegradation, Environmental; Daphnia; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Hazardous Substances; Invertebrates; Rivers; Surface-Active Agents; Water Pollutants, Chemical; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Ceriodaphnia dubia; Daphnia; Invertebrata; Protozoa"

This reveals that most research focused on levels of PFOS in surface water and fish but data on soil and crops are largely missing. Furthermore, the uptake of PFOS by farm animals and subsequent transfer into meat and animal products needs further attention, as these products will eventually be consumed by the human population.

Although these chemicals have been used in countless products since the 1950s, they have been subject to little control until now. There is still an insufficient knowledge of their sources, occurrence, and hazards for food safety decision making. This article provides a comprehensive review of the food contamination levels and dietary intake risks posed by PFCs, as well as the specific methods developed for their determination. It is based on the evaluation of the published literature between 2004 and the beginning of 2010, with special emphasis on those reports of the last two years and in the examination of the growing body of studies on the exposure assessment and food occurrence of PFCs. The current state-of-the art and future perspectives in extraction, clean-up, detection, identification, confirmation, and quantification highlighting the advantages and limitations of each technique have been summarized.

To overcome these problems, perfluorocarbon-based oxygen carriers as well as acellular-and cellular-type, hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers have been developed for use as artificial oxygen carriers. Despite their extensive evaluation, including formulation and pharmacology, they have not been extensively used in clinical settings. One of the reasons for this is that their pharmacokinetics have not been well characterized. Artificial oxygen carriers require not only an acceptable level of physicochemical activity, but also clinical efficacy, as reflected by their retention in the circulation, and the absence of measurable accumulation in the body, if unexpected adverse effects are to be avoided.

The most common glucuronidation reactions are O- and N-glucuronidation and in this review, we discuss both, while the emphasis is on N-glucuronidation. Interspecies difference in glucuronidation is another central issue in this review due to its importance in drug development. Accordingly, the available data on glucuronidation in different animals comes mainly from the species that are used in preclinical studies to assess the safety of drugs under development. Both O- and N-glucuronidation reactions are chemically diverse. Different O-glucuronidation reactions are described and discussed, and many drugs that undergo such reactions are indicated. The compounds that undergo N-glucuronidation include primary aromatic amines, hydroxylamines, amides, tertiary aliphatic amines, and aromatic N-heterocycles. The interspecies variability in N-glucuronidation is particularly high, above all when it comes to aliphatic tertiary amines and aromatic N-heterocycles. The N-glucuronidation rates in humans are typically much higher than in animals, largely due to the activity of two enzymes, the extensively studied UGT1A4, and the more recently identified as a main player in N-glucuronidation, UGT2B10.

Tetracycline has been widely used for decades in human and veterinary medicines, with incremental residues in the environment and adverse influences on living organisms. In the present study, the genetic toxicity of tetracycline was investigated using a bioassay method with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) root-meristem cells at a concentration range of 0.25-300 mg L-1 and exposure times of 24, 48, and 72 h. The results indicated that tetracycline at lower concentrations (0.25-1 mg L-1) stimulated cell mitotic division, whereas at 50-300 mg L-1 concentration caused a concentration-related decrease in mitotic index (MI). The lower tetracycline concentrations induced a slight increase in the frequency of micronucleus (MN), chromosomal aberration (CA), and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in wheat root tips. However, there were significant increases in these indices at higher concentrations in concentration- and time-dependent manners, including the frequencies of MN (25-200 mg L-1), CA (10-200 mg L-1), and SCE (5-200 mg L-1), respectively. The inducement of MN, CA, and SCE decreased at 250 and 300 mg L-1 due to acute cell toxicity for all tested times. Comparatively, SCE was the most sensitive, followed by CA, with MN the least sensitive to the genotoxicity of tetracycline in wheat. These results imply that tetracycline may be genotoxic to plant cells, and exposure to tetracycline may pose a genotoxic risk to living organisms. The results also suggest that the wheat bioassay was efficient, simple, and reproducible in monitoring the genotoxicity of tetracycline in the environment. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Chromosomal aberration; Cytogenetic damage; Emerging pollutants; Genetic toxicity; Micronucleus; Mitotic index; Root-meristem cell; Sister chromatid exchange; Tetracycline; Wheat bioassay; Biology; Chromosomes; Concentration (process); Pollution; Toxicity; Veterinary medicine; Bioassay; tetracycline; antibiotics; bioassay; concentration (composition); environmental issue; genotoxicity; organic pollutant; pollution exposure; risk factor; root system; toxicity test; wheat; bioassay; chromosome aberration; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cytotoxicity; genotoxicity; meristem; micronucleus; mitosis index; nonhuman; plant root; pollutant; priority journal; review; sister chromatid exchange; wheat; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Chromosome Aberrations; DNA Damage; Humans; Meristem; Micronucleus Tests; Mitosis; Mitotic Index; Mutagens; Sister Chromatid Exchange; Soil Pollutants; Tetracycline; Triticum; Triticum aestivum"

The Brillouin gain coefficient was calculated to be 3.09 × 10-11 m/W, which was comparable to that of fused silica fibers. The Brillouin threshold power of the 100 m POF was estimated to be as high as 24 W, which can be, for practical applications, reduced by using POFs with smaller cores.

Once these ""normal"" values have been established, the diagnosis of environmental contaminant-mediated ill-health (such as manifestations of sickness, increased mortality, a reduction in population, poor breeding success, abnormal behavior) in an individual bird or in a population could be facilitated by comparing exposure values in the investigation to reference values of the same species in the database. One might then identify the cause and pave the way for a mitigating response. The toxicant component of DABSE is being examined at the low ng ml-1 level in 200 μl of whole blood. As these analyses are invariably very costly, an effort has been made to lower these costs and so enable more testing by quantitating representative compounds as markers for the whole group.

It is actively involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including skin diseases, characterized by the presence of autoantibodies, foreign microorganisms, altered tissue cells, and the presence of mannan. Complement is intended to kill invading microorganisms but it can also destroy the organism's own damaged or altered cells. It is characterized by vigorous activity and is also potentially harmful for the host if triggered in its own body. This review discusses the significance of complement activation for emerging skin diseases and highlights the importance of serological laboratory tests for the detection of complement system activity alterations in skin diseases such as pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, herpes gestationis, dermatitis herpetiformis, porphyria, urticaria, angioedema, cutaneous vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, partial lipodystrophy, lichen planus, xeroderma pigmentosum, psoriasis, and recurrent cutaneous infections.

Obesity occurs when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure; however, individuals vary widely in their propensity to gain weight and accrue fat mass, even at identical levels of excess caloric input. Clinical, epidemiological, and biological studies show that obesity is largely programmed during early life, including the intrauterine period. The environmental obesogen hypothesis holds that prenatal or early life exposure to certain endocrine disrupting chemicals can predispose exposed individuals to increased fat mass and obesity. Obesogen exposure can alter the epigenome of multipotent stromal stem cells, biasing them toward the adipocyte lineage at the expense of bone. Hence, humans exposed to obesogens during early life might have an altered stem cell compartment, which is preprogrammed toward an adipogenic fate. This results in a higher steady state number of adipocytes and potentially a lifelong struggle to maintain a healthy weight, which can be exacerbated by societal influences that promote poor diet and inadequate exercise. This review focuses on the developmental origins of the adipocyte, the relationship between adipocyte number and obesity, and how obesogenic chemicals may interfere with the highly efficient homeostatic mechanisms regulating adipocyte number and energy balance. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; ataxin 1; beta1 integrin; CD24 antigen; CD34 antigen; endocrine disruptor; estrogen derivative; hexachlorobenzene; lipid; olanzapine; organotin compound; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; serotonin uptake inhibitor; thyroid hormone; triacylglycerol; tributyltin; tricyclic antidepressant agent; xenobiotic agent; adipocyte; adipogenesis; body fat; body mass; cell differentiation; cell lineage; cell maturation; drug use; energy balance; energy expenditure; epigenetics; health status; homeostasis; human; lipid metabolism; maternal smoking; nonhuman; obesity; prenatal exposure; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; review; side effect; thyroid function; thyroid hormone metabolism; thyroid hormone synthesis; triacylglycerol blood level; white adipose tissue; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Animals; Body Composition; Body Weight; Endocrine Disruptors; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Fetal Development; Humans; Japan; Obesity; PPAR gamma; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Republic of Korea; Stem Cells"

The adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) is a family of proteins involved in cell death pathways that perform distinctly opposite functions to regulate cell fate decisions. On the one hand, ANT catalyzes the adenosine triphosphate export from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space with the concomitant import of ADP from the intermembrane space to the matrix. On the other hand, during periods of stress, ANT could function as a lethal pore and trigger the process of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, which leads irreversibly to cell death. In human, ANT is encoded by four homologous genes, whose expression is not only tissue specific, but also varies according to the pathophysiological state of the cell. Recent evidence revealed a differential role of the ANT isoforms in apoptosis and a deregulation of their expression in cancer.

There is a growing consensus that brain injury, whether it is ischemic, hemorrhagic, or traumatic, leads to dysfunction of the BBB. Changes in BBB function observed after injury are thought to contribute to the loss of neural tissue and to affect the response to neuroprotective drugs. New discoveries suggest that considering the entire gliovascular unit, rather than the BBB alone, will expand our understanding of the cellular and molecular responses to traumatic brain injury (TBI). This review will address the BBB breakdown in TBI, the role of blood-borne factors in affecting the function of the gliovascular unit, changes in BBB permeability and post-traumatic edema formation, and the major pathophysiological factors associated with TBI that may contribute to post-traumatic dysfunction of the BBB. The key role of neuroinflammation and the possible effect of injury on transport mechanisms at the BBB will also be described.

Compartmentalization has resulted in multiple studies that would not otherwise be possible in vivo or in traditional random cultures, such as investigations of axonal transport, biochemical analysis of axons, and axonal injury/regeneration. Chambers for compartmentalizing neurons were first developed for long projection peripheral neurons in the 1970s using machined Teflon dividers and relied on manually applied grease layers to spatially and fluidically separate distal axons from their cell bodies. More recently microfabrication and soft lithography techniques have been used to create compartmentalized micro fluidic platforms, relying on microgrooves contained within a solid barrier through which axons and dendrites are able to extend, but not their cell bodies. These platforms are unique in their ability to culture central nervous system (CNS) neurons and allow high-resolution live imaging.

With the completion of the sequencing of the Human Genome and the initiation of the HapMap project the concept that the chromosomes of the mammalian genome are a mosaic, or patchwork, of conserved extended block haplotype sequences is now accepted by the mainstream genomics research community. Ancestral Haplotypes (AHs) can be viewed as a recombined string of smaller Polymorphic Frozen Blocks (PFBs). How have such variant extended DNA sequence tracts emerged in evolution? Here the relevant literature on the problem is reviewed from various fields of molecular and cell biology particularly molecular immunology and comparative and functional genomics. Based on our synthesis we then advance a testable molecular and cellular model. A critical part of the analysis concerns the origin of the strand biased mutation signatures in the transcribed regions of the human and higher primate genome, A-to-G versus T-to-C (ratio ~1.5 fold) and C-to-T versus G-to-A (≥1.5 fold). A comparison and evaluation of the current state of the fields of immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation (SHM) and Transcription-Coupled DNA Repair focused on how mutations in newly synthesized RNA might be copied back to DNA thus accounting for some of the genome-wide strand biases (e.g., the A-to-G vs T-to-C component of the strand biased spectrum). We hypothesize that the genesis of PFBs and extended AHs occurs during mutagenic episodes in evolution (e.g., retroviral infections) and that many of the critical DNA sequence diversifying events occur first at the RNA level, e.g., recombination between RNA strings resulting in tandem and dispersed RNA duplications (retroduplications), RNA mutations via adenosine-to-inosine pre-mRNA editing events as well as error prone RNA synthesis. These are then copied back into DNA by a cellular reverse transcription process (also likely to be error-prone) that we have called ""reverse transcription-mediated long DNA conversion."" Finally we suggest that all these activities and others can be envisaged as being brought physically under the umbrella of special sites in the nucleus involved in transcription known as ""transcription factories."". © 2011 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.","adenosine; inosine; messenger RNA precursor; DNA sequence; functional genomics; gene mutation; genetic polymorphism; genetic recombination; genetic transcription; genetic variability; haplotype; human; human genome; molecular evolution; mosaicism; nonhuman; primate; priority journal; reverse transcription; review; RNA analysis; RNA editing; RNA synthesis; somatic hypermutation"

The resulting oxygen deficit has important consequences with regard to the aggressiveness and malignancy of tumors, as well as their resistance to therapy, endowing the imaging of hypoxia with vital repercussions in tumor prognosis and therapy design. The molecular and cellular events underlying hypoxia are mediated mainly through hypoxia-inducible factor, a transcription factor with pleiotropic effects over a variety of cellular processes, including oncologic transformation, invasion and metastasis. However, few methodologies have been able to monitor noninvasively the oxygen tensions in vivo. MRI and MRS are often used for this purpose. Most MRI approaches are based on the effects of the local oxygen tension on: (i) the relaxation times of 19F or 1H indicators, such as perfluorocarbons or their 1H analogs; (ii) the hemodynamics and magnetic susceptibility effects of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin; and (iii) the effects of paramagnetic oxygen on the relaxation times of tissue water. 19F MRS approaches monitor tumor hypoxia through the selective accumulation of reduced nitroimidazole derivatives in hypoxic zones, whereas electron spin resonance methods determine the oxygen level through its influence on the linewidths of appropriate paramagnetic probes in vivo. Finally, Overhauser-enhanced MRI combines the sensitivity of EPR methodology with the resolution of MRI, providing a window into the future use of hyperpolarized oxygen probes. Tumor hypoxia has important consequences in the aggressiveness and malignancy of tumors, as well as in their resistance to therapy, endowing the imaging of pO2 levels with vital repercussions in tumor prognosis and therapy design. This review introduces the causes and consequences of tumor hypoxia and describes the main MR techniques implemented to visualize oxygen levels in cancers.

This paper reviews past experiences with such disposal practices and highlights their unsustainability due to the risks of contamination of ecosystems, the food chain, together with ground and drinking water supplies. The use and associated disposal of POPs have been occurring for over 50 years. Concurrent with the phase-out of some of the most hazardous chemicals, the production of new POPs, such as brominated and fluorinated compounds has increased since the 1990s. These latter compounds are commonly used in a wide range of consumer goods, and as consumer products reach the end of their useful lives, ultimately enter waste recycling and disposal systems, in particular at municipal landfills. Because of their very slow, or lack of degradability, POPs will persist in landfills for many decades and possibly centuries. Over these extended time periods engineered landfill systems and their liners are likely to degrade, thus posing a contemporary and future risk of releasing large contaminant loads to the environment. This review highlights the necessity for alternative disposal methods for POP wastes, including destruction or complete removal from potential environmental release. In addition to such end of pipe solutions a policy change in the use pattern of persistent toxic chemicals is inevitable. In addition, inventories for the location and quantity of POPs in landfills, together with an assessment of their threat to ecosystems, drinking water and food resources are identified as key measures to facilitate appropriate management of risks. Finally the challenges of POP wastes in transition/developing countries, the risk of increased leaching of POPs from landfills due to climate change, and the possible negative impact of natural attenuation processes are considered. © The Author(s) 2011.","Brominated flame retardants; HCH; PBDE; PCB; PCDD/PCDFs; Persistent organic pollutants; PFOS; POPs; Stockholm; Chemical contamination; Climate change; Consumer products; Ecosystems; Fire fighting equipment; Flame retardants; Land fill; Leaching; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Potable water; Water supply; Waste disposal; bromine; diphenyl ether; drinking water; fluorine; ground water; hexachlorobenzene; pentachlorobenzene; pesticide; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; climate change; developing world; drinking water; food chain; HCH; landfill; leaching; literature review; natural attenuation; organic pollutant; PBDE; PCB; persistence; recycling; Stockholm Convention; toxic substance; waste disposal; biodegradability; climate change; contamination; destruction; developing country; ecosystem; environmental release; fluorination; food chain; landfill; leaching; policy; pollutant; priority journal; recycling; review; threat; waste disposal; water supply; dangerous goods; environmental monitoring; methodology; pollution; risk assessment; waste disposal; waste management; Developing Countries; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Food Chain; Hazardous Substances; Refuse Disposal; Risk Assessment; Waste Management; Water Supply"

Once discharged from industrial, domestic and urban sources into the urban wastewater collection system they may transfer to the residual solids during wastewater treatment and assessment of their significance and implications for beneficial recycling of the treated sewage sludge biosolids is required. Research on organic contaminants (OCs) in biosolids has been undertaken for over thirty years and the increasing body of evidence demonstrates that the majority of compounds studied do not place human health at risk when biosolids are recycled to farmland. However, there are 143,000 chemicals registered in the European Union for industrial use and all could be potentially found in biosolids. Therefore, a literature review of 'emerging' OCs in biosolids has been conducted for a selection of chemicals of potential concern for land application based upon human toxicity, evidence of adverse effects on the environment and endocrine disruption. To identify monitoring and research priorities the selected chemicals were ranked using an assessment matrix approach. Compounds were evaluated based upon environmental persistence, human toxicity, evidence of bioaccumulation in humans and the environment, evidence of ecotoxicity and the number and quality of studies focussed on the contaminant internationally. The identified chemicals of concern were ranked in decreasing order of priority: perfluorinated chemicals (PFOS, PFOA); polychlorinated alkanes (PCAs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs); organotins (OTs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC); benzothiazoles; antibiotics and pharmaceuticals; synthetic musks; bisphenol A, quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), steroids; phthalate acid esters (PAEs) and polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMSs).A number of issues were identified and recommendations for the prioritisation of further research and monitoring of 'emerging' OCs for the agricultural use of biosolids are provided. In particular, a number of 'emerging' OCs (PFOS, PFOA and PCAs) were identified for priority attention that are environmentally persistent and potentially toxic with unique chemical properties, or are present in large concentrations in sludge, that make it theoretically possible for them to enter human and ecological food-chains from biosolids-amended soil. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Ammonium compounds; Antibiotics; Biochemistry; Biological materials; Biosolids; Chemicals; Drug products; Ecology; Esters; Ethers; Health risks; Hormones; Impurities; Industrial chemicals; Industrial water treatment; Land use; Lipids; Naphthalene; Organic compounds; Organic pollutants; Paraffins; Phenols; Polydimethylsiloxane; Recycling; Sewage sludge; Silicones; Steroid hormones; Toxicity; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water analysis; Acid ester; Benzothiazoles; Bis-phenol a; Land applications; Organotins; Perfluorochemicals; Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Polychlorinated alkanes; Polychlorinated naphthalenes; Quaternary ammonium compound; Steroids; Synthetics musks; Triclocarban; Triclosan; Organic chemicals; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; antibiotic agent; benzothiazole; dimeticone; musk; organic compound; organotin compound; perfluoro compound; phthalic acid ester; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated alkane; polychlorinated naphthalene; quaternary ammonium derivative; steroid; triclocarban; triclosan; unclassified drug; ammonium compound; antibiotics; assessment method; bioaccumulation; biosolid; drug; European Union; health risk; hormone; organic pollutant; PBDE; phthalate; public health; sewage; sludge; steroid; toxicity; waste treatment; wastewater; agricultural procedures; bioaccumulation; biosolid; chemical analysis; concentration (parameters); ecotoxicity; environmental monitoring; food chain; land use; physical chemistry; pollutant; priority journal; recycling; review; risk assessment; sludge; soil amendment; soil fertilization; Europe"

Research over the last 10 years has shown that these compounds are ubiquitous environmental contaminants they are extremely persistent, show toxic effects and accumulate in the food chain. We evaluate global, temporal and spatial trends of these important emerging contaminants. Abstract This review gives an overview of existing knowledge of polyfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) in humans and in marine biota. Temporal trends and spatial distribution of PFCs were globally compared in humans, marine mammals, seabirds and fish. In general, PFC concentrations in the environment have increased significantly from the beginning of the production up to the 1990s. After the phase-out of perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (POSF) production starting in 2000, PFC concentrations in humans generally decreased. In marine biota no clear temporal trends were observed. The temporal trends depended on the species, their trophic levels and the geographical locations. PFC patterns in humans and in marine wildlife species were compared regarding perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), their shorter and longer chain homologues (C4C15) and precursor compounds. Finally knowledge gaps were identified and recommendations for future work were presented. © CSIRO 2010.","bioaccumulation; concentration (composition); fish; food chain; literature review; marine mammal; organic pollutant; polymer; public health; seabird; spatiotemporal analysis; toxicity test; trend analysis; trophic level; Mammalia"

In the tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), ghrelin-C10 is the major form of ghrelin. Since fish are known to inhabit every ecological niche on earth, studies on fish have provided valuable insight into vertebrate physiology in general; it is likely that understanding the role of both acylated forms of ghrelin, in more detail, in fish will result into novel insights in the biology of ghrelin within vertebrates.

Although ABA is registered as a farm chemical (plant growth regulator), its practical use has been limited, mainly due to its weak effect in field trials, which is considered to be due to its rapid inactivation through biodegradation. Catabolic inactivation of ABA is mainly controlled by ABA 8'-hydroxylase (CYP707A), which is the cytochrome P450 catalyzing the C8'-hydroxylation of ABA into 8'-hydroxy-ABA and its more stable tautomer, phaseic acid, which has much lower hormonal activity than ABA. Thus, a specific inhibitor of CYP707A is promising not only as a chemical probe for the mechanism of ABA action, but also because of its potential use in agriculture and horticulture. This review article focuses on our recent research on the development of two types of specific inhibitors of CYP707A: the ABA analogue-type inhibitors that were designed on the basis of differences between the structural requirements for CYP707A and for ABA activity, and the azole-type P450 inhibitors that were developed by conformational restriction or enlargement of the plant growth retardant uniconazole. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","aba 8' hydroxylase; abscisic acid; abscisic acid 8' hydroxylase inhibitor 1; abscisic acid 8' hydroxylase inhibitor 2; cytochrome P450; enzyme inhibitor; ifap1; ifap2; ifsp1; ifsp2; ifsp3; imi x; phaseic acid; phytohormone; pyrrole; pyrrole derivative; ufap1; ufap2; ufap3; unclassified drug; uni; uni x; unspecific monooxygenase; abscisic acid; abscisic acid 8' hydroxylase; abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase; cytochrome P450; enzyme inhibitor; phytohormone; pyrrole derivative; catabolism; catalysis; chemical structure; conformation; drought tolerance; enzyme activity; enzyme structure; hydroxylation; ligand binding; nonhuman; plant growth; review; seedling; tautomer; chemistry; drug antagonism; metabolism; Abscisic Acid; Azoles; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Enzyme Inhibitors; Plant Growth Regulators"

Datasynthesis: Children and laboratory animals exposed to lead or PCBs show defcits in many aspects of attention and executive function that have been shown to be impaired in children diagnosed with ADHD, including tests of working memory, response inhibition, vigilance, and alertness. Studies conducted to date suggest that lead may reduce both attention and response inhibition, whereas PCBs may impair response inhibition to a greater degree than attention. Low-level lead exposure has been associated with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD in several recent studies. Similar studies of PCBs have not been conducted.

The diversity of manufactured PreFOS and its degradation products (e.g. C8F17SO2R and C 8F17SO2NR′R′′, where R is H or F, and R′ and R′′ are various) has made it difficult to track their fate. Temporal trends of PFOS in both humans and wildlife are discrepant, thus it is difficult to predict future exposure, and hypotheses about the role of PreFOS have been raised. Although abiotic degradation of commercially important PreFOS materials requires further research, current data suggest that the yield of PFOS is negligible or minor. On the other hand, in vivo biotransformation of PreFOS yields PFOS as the major metabolite, and &gt;32% yields have been observed. In Canadians, exposure to PreFOS was equivalent or greater than direct PFOS exposure prior to 2002. In most ocean water, PFOS is dominant to PreFOS, but in the oceans east of Greenland there may be more PreFOS than PFOS, consistent with the fact that whales and humans in this region also show evidence of substantial PreFOS exposure. Quantitative assessments of PFOS body-burdens coming from PreFOS are complicated by the fact that PreFOS partitions to the cellular fraction of blood, thus biomonitoring in serum under predicts PreFOS relative to PFOS. Many unknowns exist that prevent accurate modelling, thus analytical methods that can distinguish directly manufactured PFOS, from PFOS that has been biotransformed from PreFOS, should be applied in future human and environmental monitoring. Two new source tracking principles are presented and applied to human serum. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","drinking water; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid precursor; sea water; unclassified drug; ambient air; atmosphere; bioaccumulation; biological monitoring; biotransformation; dust; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; food; human; hydrolysis; microbial degradation; nonhuman; oxidation; photolysis; priority journal; review; sea; sediment; serum; waste water management; whale; wildlife; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Biotransformation; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Food Analysis; Humans; Cetacea"

They are highly persistent, bioaccumulative, and cause adverse effects in humans and wildlife. Because of the widespread use of these organohalogens in household items and consumer products, indoor contamination may be a significant source of human exposure, especially for children. One significant concern with regard to health effects associated with exposure to organohalogens is endocrine disruption. This review focuses on PCBs and PBDEs as old and new organohalogens, respectively, and their effects on two neuroendocrine systems; thyroid hormones and the arginine vasopressin system (AVP). Regarding neuroendocrine effects of organohalogens, there is considerable information on the thyroid system as a target and evidence is now accumulating that the AVP system and associated functions are also susceptible to disruption. AVP-mediated functions such as osmoregulation, cardiovascular function as well as social behavior, sexual function and learning/memory are discussed. For both thyroid and AVP systems, the timing of exposure seems to play a major role in the outcome of adverse effects. The mechanism of organohalogen action is well understood for the thyroid system. In comparison, this aspect is understudied in the AVP system but some similarities in neural processes, shown to be targeted by these pollutants, serve as promising possibilities for study. One challenge in understanding modes of action within neuroendocrine systems is their complexity stemming, in part, from interdependent levels of organization.

The objectives here are to: 1) provide data on changes in human contaminant concentrations and exposure among Canadian Arctic peoples; 2) identify new contaminants of concern; 3) discuss possible health effects; 4) outline risk communication about contaminants in country food; and 5) identify knowledge gaps for future contaminant research and monitoring. The nutritional and cultural benefits of country foods are substantial; however, some dietary studies suggest declines in the amount of country foods being consumed. Significant declines were found for most contaminants in maternal blood over the last 10. years within all three Arctic regions studied. Inuit continue to have the highest levels of almost all persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and metals among the ethnic groups studied. A greater proportion of people in the East exceed Health Canada's guidelines for PCBs and mercury, although the proportion of mothers exceeding these guidelines has decreased since the previous assessment. Further monitoring and research are required to assess trends and health effects of emerging contaminants. Infant development studies have shown possible subtle effects of prenatal exposure to heavy metals and some POPs on immune system function and neurodevelopment. New data suggest important beneficial effects on brain development for Inuit infants from some country food nutrients. The most successful risk communication processes balance the risks and benefits of a diet of country food through input from a variety of regional experts and the community, to incorporate the many socio-cultural and economic factors to arrive at a risk management decision that will be the most beneficial in Arctic communities. © 2010.","Arctic health; Country food; Environmental contaminant; Infant; Maternal; Organochlorines; Risk communication; Arctic engineering; Communication; Contamination; Health; Health risks; Impurities; Mercury (metal); Metals; Nutrition; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Risk analysis; Risk management; Chemical contamination; heavy metal; lead; mercury; methylmercury; perfluoro compound; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; sex hormone; arctic environment; diet; ethnic group; health risk; heavy metal; maternal health; organic pollutant; organochlorine; polar region; pollution exposure; risk assessment; Arctic; brain development; Canada; child development; climate change; cultural factor; decision making; economic aspect; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; Eskimo; food composition; food contamination; food intake; health hazard; human; immune response; infant mortality; information dissemination; knowledge; life expectancy; medical expert; medical research; mercurialism; nerve cell differentiation; nonhuman; nutritional health; oxidative stress; prenatal exposure; priority journal; review; risk assessment; risk benefit analysis; risk management; social aspect; Adolescent; Adult; Arctic Regions; Canada; Climate Change; Diet; Disease; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Environmental Pollution; Female; Health Status; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Young Adult; Canada"

This review focuses on recent experimental advances for candidate obesogens that target nuclear hormone receptors when a direct link between exposure, modulation of transcriptional networks and adipogenic phenotypes can be rationalized. Recent Findings: Various endocrine disrupting chemicals can disrupt hormonal signaling relevant to adipose tissue biology. In this review, progress on one identified obesogen, the organotin tributyltin, will be outlined to highlight principles and novel insights into its high-affinity nuclear hormone receptor-mediated mechanism, its effects on adipocyte biology, its potential to promote long-term obesogenic changes and its epidemiological relevance. When appropriate, important results for other suspected obesogenic ligands, including bisphenol A, phthalates, polybrominated diphenyl ethers and perfluoro-compounds, will highlight corroborating principles. Summary: These examples serve to provide perspective on the potential harm that man-made obesogenic pollutants pose to human health, focus attention on areas in which knowledge remains inadequate and prompt a re-evaluation of the causative risk factors driving the current changes in obesity rates. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","cell nucleus receptor; chemical compound; obesogen; organotin compound; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma agonist; retinoid X receptor; unclassified drug; adipogenesis; crystal structure; environmental exposure; human; metabolic syndrome X; nonhuman; obesity; review; white adipose tissue; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Appetite Regulation; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Homeostasis; Humans; Male; Mice; Obesity; Phenols; Phenotype; Phthalic Acids; PPAR gamma; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Retinoid X Receptors; Transcription, Genetic; Trialkyltin Compounds"

Data synthesis: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) does not occur naturally but is present in the serum of most residents of industrialized countries (U.S. median, 4 ng/mL). Drinking water is the primary route of exposure in some populations, but exposure sources are not well understood. PFOA has been used to manufacture such products as Gore-Tex and Teflon. PFOA does not break down in the environment; the human half-life is estimated at about 3 years. PFOA is not metabolized in the body; it is not lipophilic. PFOA is not directly genotoxic; animal data indicate that it can cause several types of tumors and neonatal death and may have toxic effects on the immune, liver, and endocrine systems. Data on the human health effects of PFOA are sparse. There is relatively consistent evidence of modest positive associations with cholesterol and uric acid, although the magnitude of the cholesterol effect is inconsistent across different exposure levels. There is some but much less consistent evidence of a modest positive correlation with liver enzymes. Most findings come from cross-sectional studies, limiting conclusions. Two occupational cohort studies do not provide consistent evidence for chronic disease; both are limited by sample size and reliance on mortality data. Reproductive data have increased recently but are inconsistent, and any observed adverse effects are modest. Conclusions: Epidemiologic evidence remains limited, and to date data are insufficient to draw firm conclusions regarding the role of PFOA for any of the diseases of concern.","cholesterol; drinking water; perfluorooctanoic acid; sex hormone; uric acid; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular disease; cholesterol blood level; diabetes mellitus; environmental exposure; epidemiological data; genotoxicity; health hazard; human; immunotoxicity; liver toxicity; neoplasm; nonhuman; occupational exposure; priority journal; review; thyroid disease; uric acid blood level; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Diabetes Mellitus; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fetal Development; Fluorocarbons; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Humans; Immune System; Kidney; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Octanoic Acids; Reproduction; Uric Acid; Animalia"

These mechanisms are each capable of only partially explaining observations. Transport within marine aerosols has been proposed and may explain transport over short distances but will contribute little over longer distances. However, PFO(A) has been shown to have a very short half-life in aqueous aerosols and thus sea spray was proposed as a mechanism for the generation of PFOA in the gas phase from PFO in a water body. Using the observed PFO concentrations in oceans of the Northern Hemisphere and estimated spray generation rates, this mechanism is shown to have the potential for contributing large amounts of PFOA to the atmosphere and may therefore contribute significantly to the concentrations observed in remote locations. Specifically, the rate of PFOA release into the gas phase from oceans in the Northern Hemisphere is calculated to be potentially comparable to global stack emissions to the atmosphere. The subsequent potential for atmospheric degradation of PFOA and its global warming potential are considered. Observed isomeric ratios and predicted atmospheric concentrations due to FTOH degradation are used to elucidate the likely relative importance of transport pathways. It is concluded that gas phase PFOA released from oceans may help to explain observed concentrations in remote regions. The model calculations performed in the present study strongly suggest that oceanic aerosol and gas phase field monitoring is of vital importance to obtain a complete understanding of the global dissemination of PFCAs. © 2010 SETAC.","Aqueous aerosols; Global warming potential; Long range transport; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Sea spray; Acids; Air pollution; Atmospheric aerosols; Concentration (process); Degradation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Ocean currents; Atmospheric movements; fluorine; methyl chloride; perfluoro compound; perfluorocarboxylic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; carboxylic acid; global warming; marine atmosphere; Northern Hemisphere; pollutant transport; aerosol; air pollution; aqueous solution; atmosphere; greenhouse effect; priority journal; review; Aerosols; Air Movements; Atmosphere; Carboxylic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Kinetics; Models, Chemical; Seawater; Steam; Water Pollutants; Arctic"

Furthermore, the reproductive system is thought to be under attack from exposure to environmental contaminants, particularly those chemicals shown to affect endocrine homeostasis. The relationship between exposure to environmental contaminants and adverse effects on human reproductive health are frequently debated in the scientific literature and these controversies have spread into the lay press drawing increased public and regulatory attention. Therefore, the objective of the present review was to critically evaluate the literature concerning the relationship between lifestyle exposures and adverse effects on fertility as well as examining the evidence for a role of environmental contaminants in the purported decline of semen quality and the pathophysiology of subfertility, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and endometriosis. The authors conclude that whereas cigarette smoking is strongly associated with adverse reproductive outcomes, high-level exposures to other lifestyle factors are only weakly linked with negative fertility impacts. Finally, there is no compelling evidence that environmental contaminants, at concentrations representative of the levels measured in contemporary biomonitoring studies, have any effect, positive or negative, on reproductive health in the general population. Further research using prospective study designs with robust sample sizes are needed to evaluate testable hypotheses that address the relationship between exposure and adverse reproductive health effects. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; alcohol; amphetamine; caffeine; cannabis; catecholamine; chlordiazepoxide; cocaine; diamorphine; estradiol; follitropin; luteinizing hormone; narcotic agent; nicotine; opiate; perfluoro compound; phencyclidine; phthalic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; prolactin; sex hormone binding globulin; testosterone; tetrahydrocannabinol; alcohol consumption; alcohol intoxication; alcoholism; biological monitoring; catecholamine release; cigarette smoking; endometriosis; environmental exposure; estradiol blood level; estrus cycle; feminization; fertility; follitropin blood level; health care access; hormone inhibition; human; lifestyle; low birth weight; male fertility; male infertility; nonhuman; nutritional deficiency; ovary insufficiency; ovary polycystic disease; pathophysiology; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prolactin blood level; protein blood level; reproduction; reproductive health; review; sample size; semen analysis; smoking habit; sperm; spontaneous abortion; subfertility; substance abuse; teratology; testis weight; testosterone blood level; tobacco; Alcohol Drinking; Caffeine; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Marijuana Smoking; Reproduction; Risk Factors; Substance-Related Disorders; Tobacco; Nicotiana tabacum"

Several modeling studies have been conducted in attempt to resolve the dominant transport pathway of PFCs to the arctic-atmospheric transport of precursors versus direct transport via ocean currents. These studies are generally limited by their focus on perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) fluxes to arctic seawater and thus far have only used fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and sulfonamide alcohols as inputs for volatile precursors. There have been many monitoring studies from the North American and European Arctic, however, almost nothing is known about PFC levels from the Russian Arctic. In general, there are very few measurements of PFCs from the abiotic environment. Atmospheric measurements show the widespread occurrence of PFC precursors, FTOHs and perfluorinated sulfonamide alcohols. Further, PFCAs and PFSAs have been detected on atmospheric particles. The detection of PFCAs and PFSAs in snow deposition is consistent with the volatile precursor transport hypothesis. There are very limited measurements of PFCs in seawater. PFOA is generally detected in the greatest concentrations. Additional seawater measurements are needed to validate existing model predications. The bulk of the monitoring efforts in biological samples have focused on the perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs) and sulfonates (PFSAs), although there are very few measurements of PFC precursors. The marine food web has been well studied, particularly the top predators. In contrast, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems have been poorly studied. Studies show that in wildlife perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is generally measured in the highest concentration, followed by either perfluorononanoate (PFNA) or perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnA). However, some whale species show relatively high levels of perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA) and seabirds are typically characterized by high proportions of the C11-C15 PFCAs. PFOA is generally infrequently detected and is present in low concentrations in arctic biota. Food web studies show high bioaccumulation in the upper trophic-level animals, although the mechanism of PFC biomagnification is not understood. Spatial trend studies show some differences between populations, although there are inconsistencies between PFC trends. The majority of temporal trend studies are from the Northern American Arctic and Greenland. Studies show generally increasing levels of PFCs from the 1970s, although some studies from the Canadian Arctic show recent declines in PFOS levels. In contrast, ringed seals and polar bears from Greenland continue to show increasing PFOS concentrations.

Chemicals with structures similar to the drugs and stimulants restricted by law are sold as medicines that are not so restricted. Furthermore, drugs that have evaded attention of the law and abuse of these drugs are increasing rapidly. Serious health hazards are occurring from abuse of these chemicals as well as existing abused drugs: they are thus causing a major social problem. Synthetic cannabinoids, one of these illegal drugs, is called ""spice"" and its abuse is spreading all over the world. So far, Germany and Japan have analyzed the ingredients of the spice series. Synthetic cannabinoids that have actually been detected include CP-47497 and its variations with different numbers of carbon atoms in the side chain, i.e., CP-47497-(C8), JWH-018, etc. Cases of drug dependence and health hazards, such as mental diseases, caused by abuse of spice have been reported, revealing their danger. Numerous synthetic cannabinoid derivatives emerged during the development of medicines, and the methods for synthesizing them and the strength of their binding affinity with the cannabinoid receptor have also been clarified. Under current conditions, when particular synthetic cannabinoid derivatives are restricted, others soon replace them. Although the biochemical characteristics of synthetic cannabinoid derivatives, such as binding affinity with receptors, have been clarified, actions of synthetic cannabinoid derivatives that are taken are still unknown for most derivatives. Some cannabinoid derivatives exhibit tens of times the strength of delta 9-THC, an ingredient of hemp, so it is feared that taking them may cause unexpected serious health hazards.","cannabinoid; addiction; human; review; Cannabinoids; Humans; Substance-Related Disorders"

Here, the formation of unilamellar vesicles by mixing zwitterionic tetradecyldimethylamine oxide (TDMAO) with the anionic lithium perfluorooctanesulfonate (LiPFOS) was studied as a function of the mixing ratio. SANS data were analyzed in terms of the structural changes and especially with respect to intermediate structures. Vesicle formation occurs via disk-like micelles as intermediates that close to form very monodisperse unilamellar vesicles after reaching a certain size. This process is controlled by the competition between bending energy of the bilayer and the line energy of the disk rim, and its characteristic time is controlled by the electrostatic repulsion that is determined by the TDMAO/LiPFOS ratio. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Bending energies; Bi-layer; Characteristic time; Different structure; Electrostatic repulsion; In-situ; Intermediate structures; Mixing ratios; Monodisperse; Morphological changes; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; SANS; Small-angle neutron scattering; Stopped flow; Stopped-flow techniques; Structural change; Structural information; Surfactant mixture; Surfactant solution; Time resolution; Time-resolved SANS; Unilamellar vesicle; Vesicle formation; Disks (structural components); Lithium; Neutron scattering; Surface active agents; Synchrotrons; ampholyte; anionic lithium perfluorooctanesulfonate; surfactant; tetradecyldimethylamine oxide; unclassified drug; dispersion; elecrostatic repulsion; electric conductivity; energy; mathematical analysis; membrane vesicle; mesodynamics; micelle; molecular dynamics; neutron scattering; phase transition; priority journal; review; static electricity; structure analysis"

Thus, trifluoromethylation of aromatic and aliphatic halides with trifluoromethyl iodide in the presence copper powder will be discussed first, and then the application of this copper-mediated reaction to ethyl bromodifluoroacetate for the synthesis of difluoromethylene compounds will be presented. The investigation of the mechanism of this reaction led us to the Michael addition of the (ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethyl group to ,-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. To improve this reaction, we examined the rhodium-catalyzed Michael reaction, and found that the fluorine substituent was introduced surprisingly not to the -position but to the -position. This reaction could be used to introduce other fluoroalkyl groups, including the trifluoromethyl group, to the -position of almost all Michael acceptors. Furthermore, this reaction was developed for the introduction of the trifluoromethyl or other fluoroalkyl groups into the -position of ketones or carboxylic acid derivatives through silyl enol ethers or ketene silyl acetals. 1 Introduction 2 Trifluoromethylation Using Trifluoromethyl Iodide and Copper Powder 3 Copper-Mediated Reactions of Ethyl Bromodifluoroacetate 3.1 Coupling Reactions with Alkenyl and Aryl Iodides 3.2 Michael Reaction 4 Rhodium-Catalyzed Reactions 4.1 Attempted Michael-Type Reaction, and a New Type of Reaction: Introduction of a Fluorine Substituent to the [nl]-Position of a Carbonyl Group 4.2 Extension of the -Substitution Reaction to Trifluoromethylation 4.3 Other -Perfluoroalkylations of ,-Unsaturated Ketones 5 Perfluoroalkylation of Ketones via Silyl Enol Ethers 5.1 Reaction of Long-Chain Perfluoroalkyl Iodides 5.2 Improvement of the Reaction for Trifluoromethylation with Diethylzinc 5.3 -Trifluoromethylation of Other Carbonyl Compounds 5.4 -Perfluoroalkylation of Other Carbonyl Compounds 6 Conclusion. © Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart New York.","Diethylzinc; Perfluoroalkylation; Rhodium complexes; Silyl enol ethers; Trifluoromethyl; Trifluoromethylation; Unsaturated ketones; Addition reactions; Carbonylation; Carboxylic acids; Complexation; Copper; Copper powder; Copper powder metallurgy; Ethers; Fluorine; Fluorine compounds; Ketones; Organic acids; Rhodium; Substitution reactions; Synthesis (chemical); Unsaturated compounds; Rhodium compounds; (ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethyl derivative; aliphatic compound; alkenyl group; aromatic compound; carboxylic acid derivative; chemical compound; copper; diethylzinc; difluoromethylene derivative; ethylbromodifluoroacetic acid; fluorine; fluorine derivative; halide; ketone derivative; methyl iodide; organic compound; rhodium complex; trifluoromethyl derivative; trifluoromethyl iodide; unclassified drug; alpha chain; beta sheet; catalysis; drug binding site; drug determination; drug structure; drug synthesis; drug transformation; methylation; Michael addition; review; trifluoromethylation"

Understanding generational shifts is especially important given the coming retirement of Baby Boomer workers and their replacement by those born after 1982 (GenMe/GenY/Millennials). Findings: Most studies, including the few time-lag studies, show that GenX and especially GenMe rate work as less central to their lives, value leisure more, and express a weaker work ethic than Boomers and Silents. Extrinsic work values (e.g., salary) are higher in GenMe and especially GenX. Contrary to popular conceptions, there were no generational differences in altruistic values (e.g., wanting to help others). Conflicting results appeared in desire for job stability, intrinsic values (e.g., meaning), and social/affiliative values (e.g., making friends). GenX, and especially GenMe are consistently higher in individualistic traits. Overall, generational differences are important where they appear, as even small changes at the average mean that twice or three times as many individuals score at the top of the distribution. Implications: To recruit GenMe, companies should focus on work-life balance issues and flexible schedules. Programs based on volunteering, altruistic values, social values, or meaning in work will likely be no more successful than they were for previous generations. The lack of generational differences in job hopping suggests that GenMe workers who are satisfied will be retained. Originality/value: No previous review has summarized all of the available studies examining generational differences in work values. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.",

Water-soluble conjugated polymers have been widely used for protein sensing due to their distinct optical response in the presence of different analytes. This review summarizes the recent developments in water-soluble conjugated polymer-based protein sensors. Based on the different optical responses of conjugated polymers to proteins, these assays are categorized into three groups. The conformational change of cationic poly(thiophene)s is used to generate unique colorimetric or fluorescent transduction upon interaction with target proteins. Super-quenching of water-soluble poly(phenylene vinylene)s and poly(phenylene ethynylene)s has been developed into fluorescence turn-on and turn-off protein assays. Energy transfer between poly(fluorene-co-phenylene) derivatives and acceptor dyes is also utilized to develop fluorescence turn-on protein assays with amplified signal output.

This requirement implies adapting monitoring locations and density, and monitoring frequency. It might also imply adapting monitoring techniques by integrating alternative screening methods and emerging tools for monitoring water quality to complement existing monitoring.We present the results of five European case studies that explored the potential uses of screening methods and emerging tools for responding to the new monitoring challenges of the WFD under different hydrological and environmental conditions. Combining their technical characteristics with the practical needs identified by monitoring experts and water stakeholders, we identified potential applications and opportunities for operational and investigative monitoring.

Studies examining the relationship between body burden and exposure via indoor dust are inconsistent; while some indicate a link between body burdens and PBDE and HBCD exposure via dust ingestion, others find no correlation. Likewise, while concentrations in indoor dust and human tissues are both highly skewed, this does not necessarily imply causality. Evidence suggests exposure via dust ingestion is higher for toddlers than adults. Research priorities include identifying means of reducing indoor concentrations and indoor monitoring methods that provide the most ""biologically-relevant"" measures of exposure as well as monitoring a wider range of microenvironment categories.

The tolerability and safety of triclosan has been evaluated in human volunteers with little indication of toxicity or sensitization. Although information in humans from chronic usage of personal care products is not available, triclosan has been extensively studied in laboratory animals. When evaluated in chronic oncogenicity studies in mice, rats, and hamsters, treatment-related tumors were found only in the liver of male and female mice. Application of the Human Relevance Framework suggested that these tumors arose by way of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) activation, a mode of action not considered to be relevant to humans. Consequently, a Benchmark Dose (BMDL10) of 47mg/kg/day was developed based on kidney toxicity in the hamster. Estimates of the amount of intake from in the use of representative personal care products for men, women, and children were derived in two ways: (1) using known or assumed triclosan levels in various consumer products and assumed usage patterns (product-based estimates); and (2) using upper bound measured urinary triclosan levels from human volunteers (biomonitoring-based estimates) using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the product-based estimates, the margin of safety (MOS) for the combined exposure estimates of intake from the use of all triclosan-containing products considered were approximately 1000, 730, and 630 for men, women, and children, respectively. The MOS calculated from the biomonitoring-based estimated intakes were 5200, 6700, and 11,750 for men, women, and children, respectively.

Methods: We systematically reviewed original, quantitative studies of patients', research participants', or journal readers' views about FTs to pharmaceutical and medical device companies. The MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge databases were searched for English-language studies containing original, quantitative data on attitudes toward FTs. We screened 6561 citations and retrieved 244 potentially eligible abstracts. Of these, 20 met inclusion criteria. Results: Eleven studies assessed FTs and perceptions of quality. In clinical care, patients believed FTs decreased the quality and increased the cost of care. In research, FTs affected perceptions of study quality. In 2 studies, readers' perceptions of journal article quality decreased after disclosure of FTs. Eight studies assessed the acceptability of FTs. Patients were more likely to view personal gifts to physicians as unacceptable, compared with professional gifts. In 6 of the 10 studies that assessed the importance of disclosure, most patients and research participants believed FTs should be disclosed; in the other 4, approximately one-quarter believed FTs should be disclosed. Among the 7 studies assessing willingness to participate in research, approximately one-quarter of participants reported less willingness after disclosure of FTs. Conclusions: Patients believe that FTs influence professional behavior and should be disclosed. Patients, physicians, and research participants believe FTs decrease the quality of research evidence, and, for some, knowledge of FTs would affect willingness to participate in research. ©2010 American Medical Association.

Among the catalysts, metal phosphate such as AlPO4 was high in initial activity, but conversion of PFCs decreased in the reaction duration. For the transitional metal modified γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the protective layer of aluminate with spinel structure inhibited the transformation of γ-Al2O3 into inert phases and resulted in better stability than pure γ-Al2O3, but after long time reaction the decrease in catalyst surface acidity resulted in loss in catalytic activity. Comparatively, phosphate promoted γ-Al2O3 can resist the transformation of γ-Al2O3 into inert phases and keep the surface acidity, and is considered as a promising catalyst for the catalytic decomposition of PFCs.",

In this review, we categorized various LEEB phenomena according to characterization and related mechanisms, including inter-chain aggregates and/or excimers, on-chain ketone defect emissions, interchain ketone-based excimers, and hydroxy-terminated oxidation on the interface of devices. Recent advances in highly stable blue light-emitting polyfluorenes are categorically summarized. This review highlighted the contributions of the steric hindrance effects of various nonplanar bulky groups, molecular conformations and topologies of chains and antioxidant hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS), together with physical blending as well as interface engineering. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.",

Fluorocarbon solvents and polymers, and solvents or polymers with similar properties that are not composed solely of carbon and fluorine (so-called 'fluorous' solvents or polymers) have a low ability to dissolve or sorb solutes or penetrants. This lack of solvating ability can lead to selective extractions. Fluorous phases will solvate, and therefore extract or transport, fluorous solutes, or non-fluorous solutes that are stabilized in the fluorous phase by non-covalent interactions with a 'host' or 'receptor' molecule that is in the fluorous phase. In this review, there is a brief discussion of molecular recognition as applied to selective extraction. Fluorous solvents are introduced, and there is a description of some recent applications, chiefly in synthetic organic chemistry. In particular, it is important to understand solute partitioning behavior and methods to predict it when one of the solvents is fluorous. Fluorous polymers Teflon AF1600 and AF2400 have been used in separations. Their rather complex and still not completely understood properties in separations and transport are described. There is a discussion of molecular recognition in fluorous phases as well as a brief discussion of efficient methods of carrying out extractions for analytical or physicochemical purposes. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Efficient method; Fluorous; Fluorous solvents; Isolation and purification; Non-covalent interaction; Sample clean-up; Selective extraction; Solute partitioning; Synthetic organic chemistry; Teflon AF; Biological materials; Complexation; Fluorine; Metal recovery; Molecular biology; Molecular recognition; Polymers; Solvents; Solvent extraction; cinnamyl alcohol; fluorocarbon; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorotributylamine; phenobarbital; polymer; pyridine derivative; analytic method; chemical composition; chemical interaction; chemical structure; covalent bond; ecotoxicity; molecular recognition; molecular stability; phase partitioning; phase separation; physical chemistry; priority journal; process technology; purification; review; solid phase extraction; solvation; solvent extraction; transport kinetics; Chemical Fractionation; Fluorescent Dyes; Polymers"

The syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the folliculin (FLCN) gene, encoding the folliculin tumor-suppressor protein. Numerous mutations have been described in the FLCN gene, the most frequent occurring within a C8 tract of exon 11. This hypermutability is probably due to a slippage in DNA polymerase during replication, resulting in gains/losses of repeat units, causing cancer predisposition. The main phenotypic manifestations related to this disease are lung cysts, leading to pneumothorax, and a 7-fold increased risk for renal neoplasia, although other neoplastic manifestations have been described in BHD-affected individuals.

Research on PBDEs has been extensively conducted in e-waste dumping sites in Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, where the PBDE levels in the environmental matrices and human bodies are relatively high. PFOS/PFOA levels are relatively low in environmental matrices and human bodies in China, perhaps because of the lower usage in China compared with North America. The recent studies have indicated the widespread occurrence of PBDEs and perfluorinated compounds in China. Usually, PBDE-209 is the predominant component of PBDEs, and PFOS is the major perfluorinated compounds in environmental samples.

Upon ligand binding, PPARs dimerize with retinoid receptors, translocate to the nucleus, recognize specific PP-responsive elements on DNA and transactivate a number of genes. Several processes are regulated by PPARs, such as mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid uptake and β-oxidation, inflammation, intracellular lipid trafficking, cell proliferation and death. In addition, PPARs have been proposed to act as tumor suppressors or as tumor promoters, depending on the circumstances. In particular, PPs have been extensively studied for their hepatocarcinogenic action in rodents, most often ascribed to their antiapoptotic action. Recent evidence, however, has been provided about the antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and differentiation-promoting activities displayed by PPAR ligands.

More extensive research is needed in order to evaluate how pollutants are detrimental to eel populations. Getting a comprehensive overview of the quality (including contamination levels, biomarker responses, lipid content and condition) of the silver eel population all over Europe seems to be an essential and urgent objective for the European eel management. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","endocrine disruptor; flame retardant; heavy metal; organophosphate insecticide; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl; volatile organic compound; xenobiotic agent; bioaccumulation; biomarker; chemical pollutant; eel; fishery management; fitness; immune system; lipid; pollution effect; population decline; reproductive success; spawning; stock assessment; eel; endocrine system; environmental exposure; genotoxicity; geographic distribution; immunotoxicity; lipid composition; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; osmoregulation; oxidative stress; parasite; priority journal; quality control; reproduction; reproductive toxicity; review; sea pollution; water contamination; Anguilla; Animals; Endocrine System; Immune System; Nervous System; Reproduction; Soil Pollutants; Water Pollutants; Europe; Anguilla anguilla"

Inflammation is central to the process of neuronal death, yet the roles of the complement cascade in this process have proven to be complex and hard to unravel. The complement cascade is involved in triggering cell death and recruiting cells of the immune system to sites of inflammation, including the brain. However, complement might also have important neuroprotective roles that are only now coming to light. Recent evidence suggests that targeted activation of complement might be a potential approach for treatment of stroke and other acute neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review these novel neuroprotective roles of the complement cascade, focusing on signaling pathways that might provide new therapeutic targets in acute neuronal injury. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The common feature of these methods is the application of sulfinyl group as a chiral auxiliary to control the stereochemical outcome of the reactions under study. In particular, the following general methods are critically discussed: diastereoselective methylene transfer from diazomethane to the carbonyl of β-keto-γ-fluoroalkyl sulfoxides as a general approach for preparation of various α-fluoroalkyl α-sulfinylalkyl oxiranes. The resulting compounds were used as true chiral synthons for their further elaboration via oxidative or reductive desulfurization, to numerous fluorine-containing and biologically relevant amino- and hydroxy-containing derivatives. Another general approaches discussed here are asymmetric additions to C{double bond, long}N double bond. One of them is addition of chiral sulfoxide stabilized carbon nucleophiles to fluorine-containing imines, leading to convenient preparation of alpha-fluoroalkyl derivatives of alpha amino acids and amines. Another approach is asymmetric Reformatsky reaction between N-sulfinyl imines and ethyl bromodifluoroacetate allowing operationally convenient preparation of α,α-difluoro-β-amino acids in enantiomerically pure form. Finally, structurally similar but mechanistically different addition reactions of diethyl difluoromethylphosphonate to N-sulfinyl imines, as a general approach to asymmetric synthesis of α,α-difluoro-β-aminophosphonates and phosphonic acids, are discussed. Effect of fluorine on the mechanism and stereochemical outcome of these reactions is discussed in detail and compared, where it is possible, with that of the analogous reactions of fluorine-free substrates. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The currently available colloids vary in their physico-chemical, pharmaco-dynamic and pharmaco-kinetic properties. In particular, they differ in molecular weight, which partly determines their duration of action, and in their ability to expand the plasma volume. Dextran, hydroxyethyl starch and hypertonic colloid solutions improve oxygen flux within the microcirculation. Despite their benefits, the use of dextran and high molecular weight starches is limited by their negative impact on coagulation. In addition, these macro-molecules may also induce acute renal failure in susceptible patients. Current research focuses on the development of artificial oxygen carriers as plasma expanders.

Multiple scientific studies of polar bears indicate negative relationships between exposure to these contaminants and health parameters; however, these are all of a correlative nature and do not represent true cause-and-effects. Therefore, information from controlled studies of farmed Norwegian Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and housed East and West Greenland sledge dogs (Canis familiaris) were included as supportive weight of evidence in the clarification of contaminant exposure and health effects in polar bears. The review showed that hormone and vitamin concentrations, liver, kidney and thyroid gland morphology as well as reproductive and immune systems of polar bears are likely to be influenced by contaminant exposure. Furthermore, exclusively based on polar bear contaminant studies, bone density reduction and neurochemical disruption and DNA hypomethylation of the brain stem seemed to occur. The range of tissue concentration, at which these alterations were observed in polar bears, were ca. 1-70,000. ng/g lw for OCs (blood plasma concentrations of some PCB metabolites even higher), ca. 1-1000. ng/g lw for PBDEs and for PFCs and Hg 114-3052. ng/g ww and 0.1-50 Μg/g ww, respectively. Similar concentrations were found in farmed foxes and housed sledge dogs while the lack of dose response designs did not allow an estimation of threshold levels for oral exposure and accumulated tissue concentrations. Nor was it possible to pinpoint a specific group of contaminants being more important than others nor analyze their interactions. For East Greenland polar bears the corresponding daily ΞOC and oral exposure was estimated to be 35 and 0.34 Μg/kg body weight, respectively. Furthermore, PFC concentrations, at which population effect levels could occur, are likely to be reached around year 2012 for the East Greenland polar bear subpopulation if current increasing temporal trends continue. Such proposed reproductive population effects were supported by physiological based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling of critical body residues (CBR) with risk quotients > 1 for ΞPCB, dieldrin, ΞPFC and ΞOHC (organohalogen contaminant). The estimated daily TEQ for East Greenland polar bears and East Greenland sledge dogs were 32-281-folds above WHO ΞTEQ guidelines for humans. Compared to human tolerable daily intake (TDI), these were exceeded for PCBs, dieldrin, chlordanes and ΞHCH in East Greenland polar bears. Comparisons like these should be done with caution, but together with the CBR modelling and T-score estimations, these were the only available tools for polar bear risk evaluation. In conclusion, polar bears seem to be susceptible to contaminant induced stress that may have an overall sub-clinical impact on their health and population status via impacts on their immune and reproductive systems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Bone; Brain; Climate change; Contamination; Endocrinology; Health; Hormones; Immune system; Impurities; Insecticides; Liver; Mercury (metal); Mercury compounds; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Reviews; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Steroid hormones; Tissue; Vitamins; Arctic; Arctic foxes; Bone mineral density; Critical body residue; CYP-450; Endocrine disruption; Endocrine organs; Kidney; OCPs; OHCs; Organochlorine pesticides; Organochlorines; Organohalogen contaminants; Osteoporosis; PBDEs; PFCs; Polar bears; Reproductive organs; Sexual organs; Skeletal system; Sledge dog; T-score; Thyroid hormones; Mammals; chlordane; dieldrin; hormone; mercury; organochlorine derivative; organohalogen derivative; perfluoro compound; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; vitamin; bear; endocrine disruptor; health impact; health risk; hormone; immune system; long range transport; mercury (element); organochlorine; PBDE; PCB; pesticide; physiological response; pollutant transport; pollution effect; pollution exposure; predator; reproductive health; vitamin; animal health; animal tissue; Arctic; bioaccumulation; body weight; bone density; brain stem; Canis familiaris; concentration response; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease predisposition; DNA methylation; dog; environmental exposure; female; fox; genital system; health hazard; hormone blood level; immune system; kidney; liver; male; maximum permissible dose; neurochemistry; nonhuman; pharmacokinetics; polar bear; predator; priority journal; review; stress; thyroid gland; tissue level; vitamin blood level; Vulpes lagopus; Alopex lagopus; Canidae; Canis familiaris; Ursus maritimus; Vulpes lagopus"

We performed a literature search using PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus via the library at University of California San Francisco, and a hand search of relevant text books to investigate products that can be considered anti-irritants in either prevention or treatment. Emphasis was placed on studies that included quantitative and qualitative results and that followed evidence-based dermatological guidelines. Anti-irritants provide some evidences that they may be beneficial in reducing ICD though some studies indicated no effect. The conflicting observations summarized here suggest that well controlled, but often arduous, field type studies are required for confirmation. Anti-irritant agents counteract or suppress irritation responses. These agents/ingredients, regardless of whether naturally occurring or man-made, used alone or in formulations, should possess the capacity to reduce irritation caused by acute and chronic exposure to irritants [1]. Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is common in the workplace and at home [2]. During daily activities, human skin may be exposed to potential irritants (for example, surfactants, cutting oils, etc.) that might result in ICD [3, 4]. Minimizing exposure to such harmful substances is recommended but often not practical since in many occupations, for instance, farmers, forest firefighters, outdoor activities, hospitals and even households such encounters are ubiquitous. To prevent or reduce the risk of developing ICD, anti-irritants agents/substances including barrier creams (BC) and moisturizers are widely utilized [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Though BC and moisturizers are not identical, probably, due to their ambiguous definitions, the terms BC and moisturizers are often used interchangeably in the literature and marketplace. The BC target is in the prevention of external noxious substances penetrating skin, used usually in occupational settings [6, 8, 9, 10] and moisturizers are frequently used for ""dry"" skin conditions as well as to maintain healthy skin [5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13]. However, moisturizers and BC may share characteristics [5]; to strictly distinguish between them may be difficult. Therefore, standardized terminology of skin protection is suggested [14]. We summarize the common terms and definitions in this field, as listed in Table 1. Numerous ingredients have been formulated into the skin protection products in the marketplace. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only endorsed 13 skin protectants for over-the-counter (OTC) products [15]. Based (Table Presented) on an extensive literature review, we summarize related studies and data of the efficacy of proposed anti-irritant agents/substances in reducing ICD in man. Studies were excluded if not conducted inman, as there is limited validation data relating such animal studies to men. © 2010 Dustri-Verlag Dr. Karl Feistle.","allantoin; aluminum hydroxide; aluminum hydroxychloride; borage oil; calamine; dexpanthenol; dimeticone; fish oil; glycerol; hydrocortisone; kaolin; lipid emulsion; non prescription drug; perfluoropolyether derivative; petrolatum; pimecrolimus; polyether derivative; propolis; rapeseed oil; skin protective agent; sunflower oil; tannin; Theobroma oil; unclassified drug; urea; water oil cream; white petrolatum; zinc acetate; zinc carbonate; zinc oxide; agricultural worker; contact dermatitis; emulsion; evidence based practice; fire fighter; food and drug administration; home; human; hydrogel; irritant dermatitis; long term exposure; nonhuman; practice guideline; review; skin penetration; skin protection; workplace"

CRP belongs to the family of pentraxins and as such consists of five identical non-covalently linked subunits. Contradictory data on the characteristics of CRP as either being pro- or anti-inflammatory may be explained by the existence of two conformations of the protein: the circulating native, pentameric CRP (pCRP) and the monomeric isoform (mCRP), formed as a result of a dissociation process of pCRP. In vitro both isoforms exhibit a very distinct inflammatory profile. We recently identified a localized, physiologically relevant pCRP dissociation mechanism by activated platelets and apoptotic cells and showed the deposition of mCRP in inflamed tissue. Here we review the literature on the causal role of pCRP and mCRP in the light of our findings and critically analyze the current controversies around CRP. The novel understanding of the localized dissociation of circulating pentameric CRP to the distinctively pro-inflammatory monomeric CRP allows for a new view on CRP in inflammatory reactions and further highlights mCRP and the pCRP dissociation process as a potential therapeutic target. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.","C reactive protein; CD16 antigen; CD64 antigen; complement component C1q; complement component C2; complement component C3; complement component C4; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement membrane attack complex; Fc receptor IIa; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; interleukin 1; interleukin 18; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; low density lipoprotein; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; monomeric c reactive protein; nitric oxide synthase; octapeptide; pentameric c reactive protein; phosphorylcholine; ribonucleoprotein; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; atherosclerosis; blood level; cardiovascular risk; conformational transition; cytokine release; endothelium cell; human; immunohistochemistry; inflammation; ischemia; lipid raft; macrophage; neutrophil; nonhuman; protein binding; protein expression; protein interaction; protein motif; protein structure; protein synthesis; reperfusion injury; review; thrombocyte; thrombocyte activation"

Beta-cell death can be limited posttransplantation by targeting hypoxia-induced cellular pathways that cause apoptotic death. Owing to low revascularization, impaired oxygenation seems to prevail in intraportally transplanted islets. Means to improve revascularization, oxygenation and function of transplanted islets can be achieved not only by stimulating angiogenic factors, but also by decrease of angiostatic factors such as thrombospondin-1 in islets for transplantation. Moreover, bone-marrow-derived cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells, can induce or contribute to increased revascularization. Summary: Low oxygenation of islets contributes to cellular death and dysfunction during preparation of islets for transplantation, as well as posttransplantation. Interventions at these different steps to ensure adequate oxygenation have the potential to improve the results of clinical islet transplantation. © 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","acetylcysteine; alkane; alpha 1 antitrypsin; angiogenic factor; antioxidant; endostatin; fibroblast growth factor; gelatinase B; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; oxygen; perfluorodecalin; perfluorohexyloctane; reactive oxygen metabolite; scatter factor; thrombospondin; thrombospondin 1; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; vasculotropin A; aerobic metabolism; bone marrow cell; cell death; cell function; cell survival; hematopoietic stem cell; hypoxia; in vitro study; kidney capsule; mesenchymal stem cell; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; oxygen tension; oxygenation; pancreas islet; pancreas islet beta cell; pancreas islet cell; pancreas islet transplantation; revascularization; review; swine; Animals; Cell Death; Cell Hypoxia; Humans; Islets of Langerhans; Islets of Langerhans Transplantation; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Tissue and Organ Harvesting; Tissue Culture Techniques"

These bound proteins can be imaged directly, or they may form 2-D crystalline arrays that are amenable to structure determination by single particle analysis or 2-D electron crystallography. 2-D crystals grown by this technique can also be used to initiate the growth of 3-D crystals for X-ray diffraction analysis. Many derivatized lipids have been prepared for use with this technique, incorporating a diverse range of ligands to enable binding to specific proteins. Synthetic lipids containing functionalized head groups that chelate Ni2+ or Cu2+ have also been prepared to bind and orient expressed proteins that contain His-tags. Protein-binding monolayer-forming lipids generally consist of two distinct components: (1) a branched hydrocarbon tail to confer fluidity to the monolayer and (2) a functionalized hydrophilic head group to facilitate binding of protein molecules at the air-water interface. Newer examples of these compounds also incorporate perfluorinated hydrocarbon moieties to confer detergent resistance to these lipids. This review focuses on synthetic approaches to functionalized lipids for protein monolayer crystallizations. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",

Electrodiagnosis nevertheless plays a crucial role in assessing brachial plexopathies, particularly in the perspective of post-traumatic surgical reconstructions. The evaluation aims to locate as precisely as possible injuries within the plexus, as well as to determine their severity and capacity for recovery. This requires various sensory nerve conduction studies and needle EMG recordings of ""marker"" muscles. Plexopathies differ from radiculopathies by altered sensory nerve responses and unaltered functional innervation of paracervical muscles. We propose to simplify the exploration of brachial plexopathies by following some practical rules derived from a reanalysis of the brachial plexus anatomic sketch. Two main simplification rules can be deduced from an analysis of the anatomic sketch. First it would be judicious to associate the plexopathies involving a single element of the brachial plexus with distinct etiological and symptomatic patterns according to the altered element, as one does for peripheral nerve and root pathologies. The second proposal relies on the observation that each supraclavicular ""truncal"" element (upper, middle, or lower) of the brachial plexus results from reunion of cervical root nerves and behaves like a ""super-root"" for the upper limb, while each infraclavicular ""cord"" element (posterior, lateral, or medial) is the sum of two or more peripheral nerves and behaves like a ""super-nerve"". Accordingly, the motor and sensory abnormalities associated with the lesion of a single plexus branch may occupy a clinical and electrophysiological territory that recovers those of its constituants. Except the unaltered paracervical muscles, it is useful to reduce the topographical semiology of truncal lesions to well-known cervical radiculopathies (upper trunk neuropathy to C5 and C6 associated radiculopathies, middle trunk neuropathy to C7 radiculopathy, lower trunk neuropathy to C8 and T1 associated radiculopathies); and that of cord lesions to well-known mononeuropathies of the upper limb (for example, a posterior cord neuropathy may be considered as a full radial mononeuropathy associated with an axillary one). This method of simplification allows to demystify the brachial plexopathies and to facilitate their comprehension and exploration. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Whether these changes are related to the mechanical or to the chemical properties of PFCL is unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate pressure spikes or shearing forces during endotamponade with PFCL and standardised eye movements. Material and Methods: Part 1: In an eye model the resulting pressure forces of 6 PFCL were measured at four different sites during standardised eye movements. Part 2: Shearing forces were determined in a plexiglass eye model and the resulting tangential forces at the PFCL-retina interface were calculated. Part 3: Rabbit eyes were vitrectomised and filled with light and heavy fluorocarbons for 6 weeks. Subsequently, the retina were examined histologically and by immunohistochemistry. Results: With increasing filling of the eye model, the maximum of the pressure peaks moved from the inferior wall of the eye model to the lateral eye walls. For perfluorodecalin (PFD) the highest pressure peak was 407 Pa with a 75 % filling of the vitreous cavity. The lowest pressure peak was 314 Pa with a 50 % filling of hexafluoropropene oxide. Shearing forces for standardised accelerations were dependent on viscosity and ranged between 0.87 mN/m2 (perfluorohexyloctane) and 8055 mN/m2 (hexafluoropropene oxide). Part 3: Histological and immunohistochemical analyses did not reveal pressure-related damage or any difference between the effects of the different tamponades in vivo. Conclusion: In comparison with physiological dynamic and static pressure peaks, the measured mechanical forces induced by intraocular PFCL tamponades are low. Specific gravity and mechanical damage by intraocular PFCL as a cause of retinal damage seem unlikely.

Seven incense mixtures were analyzed using GC-MS and LC-MS/MS in order to test for synthetic cannabinoids that cause psychogenic effects. The incense mixtures contained either a CP47,497-C8-homologe or JWH-018, or both in combination. Synthetic cannabinoids could not be detected in some mixtures. The German penal code sanctions persons who drive a motor vehicle unsafely following consumption of inebriating substances. Therefore the legal basis of the sanction is analytical proof of psycho-active substances in the driver's blood. A method for quantitative detection of JWH-018 in serum was developed because some of the ""Spice"" incense mixtures contained JWH-018 as the only active component. More specifically, serum samples were concentrated using a C18 solid-phase extraction column and the extracts were effectively analyzed using the LC-MS/MS System. The detection limit and the quantification limit were 0.2 ng/mL and 0.6 ng/mL respectively. Other popular drugs did not interfere with this highly selective quantification of JWH-018 in serum. When using this detection method to test forensic blood samples, JWH-018 concentrations ranging from 0.2 ng/mL to 2.5 ng/mL were measured. Therefore it is possible to detect JWH-018 - one of the psycho-active ingredients of the incense drug ""Spice"" - in serum and thus provide the analytical evidence necessary for criminal prosecution.","3 (1 naphthoyl) 1 pentylindole; cannabinoid derivative; unclassified drug; human; liquid chromatography; review; solid phase extraction; tandem mass spectrometry"

Owing to their persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) characteristics, PFOS has been phased out by its principal producer and the use of PFOA has been reduced. This PBT potential and a number of pollution incidents have led in recent years to an increase in studies surveying the concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in environmental waters worldwide. This paper reviews the results of these studies, as well as the monitoring that was conducted after the pollution incidents. The results of surveys suggest that PFOS and PFOA are found in environmental waters worldwide at low levels. In general, these levels are below health-based values set by international authoritative bodies for drinking water. There have been limited measurements of these chemicals in drinking water, but again these are below health-based values, except in some cases following pollution incidents. Monitoring studies suggested that where PFOS and PFOA were detected, they were at similar levels in both source and drinking water, suggesting that drinking water treatment does not remove these chemicals. However, new data show that PFOS and PFOA are effectively removed by granular activated carbon absorbers in practice.

It has been suggested that chloramination of surface waters with a high concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) could result in elevated NDMA formation. Growing evidence suggests that NDMA occurs more frequently and at higher concentrations in drinking water systems that practise chloramination compared to systems that use chlorination.","Chloramination; Dimethylamines; Dissolved organic carbon; Drinking water; Drinking water systems; Emerging pollutants; High concentration; Mechanisms of formation; Mechanisms of formation of nitrosamines; N-nitrosodimethylamine; Nitrosodimethylamine; South Africa; Amination; Dissolution; Organic carbon; Pollution detection; Surface waters; Water distribution systems; Water pollution control; Potable water; chemical reaction; concentration (composition); dissolved organic carbon; drinking water; nitrogen compound; pollutant removal; surface water; water pollution; South Africa"

Two major PFA subclasses are the perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) and carboxylic acids (PFCAs). The physicochemical properties and partitioning behavior for the linear PFA members are poorly understood and widely debated. Even less is known about the numerous branched congeners with varying perfluoroalkyl chain lengths, leading to confounding issues around attempts to constrain the properties of PFAs. Current computational methods are not adequate for reliable multimedia modeling efforts and risk assessments. These compounds are widely present in surface, ground, marine, and drinking waters at concentrations that vary from pg L- 1 to g L- 1. Concentration gradients of up to several orders of magnitude are observed in all types of aquatic systems and reflect proximity to known industrial sources concentrated near populated regions. Some wastewaters contain PFAs at mg L- 1 to low g L- 1 levels, or up to 10 orders of magnitude higher than present in more pristine receiving waters. With the exception of trifluoroacetic acid, which is thought to have both significant natural and anthropogenic sources, all PFSAs and PFCAs are believed to arise from human activities. Filtration and sorption technologies offer the most promising existing removal methods for PFAs in aqueous waste streams, although sonochemical approaches hold promise. Additional studies need to be conducted to better define opportunities from evaporative, extractive, thermal, advanced oxidative, direct and catalyzed photochemical, reductive, and biodegradation methods. Most PFA treatment methods exhibit slow kinetic profiles, hindering their direct application in conventional low hydraulic residence time systems.","Partitioning behavior; Perfluorinated acids; Perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids; Physicochemical property; Sulfonic acid; Treatment methods; Water and wastewater; Biodegradation; Biological water treatment; Carboxylic acids; Impurities; Multimedia systems; Organic acids; Risk assessment; Risk management; Sorption; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Water recycling; carboxylic acid; drinking water; ground water; lake water; perfluorinated sulfonic acid; perfluoro compound; sea water; surface water; trifluoroacetic acid; unclassified drug; well water; acidity; activated sludge; aquatic environment; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; biodegradation; catalysis; chemical structure; China; computer model; concentration (parameters); decomposition; detoxification; evaporation; filtration; Indian Ocean; ion exchange; Japan; land drainage; landfill; liquid liquid extraction; Mediterranean Sea; melting point; Pacific Ocean; photocatalysis; physical chemistry; reduction kinetics; review; risk assessment; solubility; swimming pool; temperature dependence; vapor pressure; waste water; water treatment; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Fatty Acids; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Micelles; Solubility; Volatilization; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water; Water Purification; Water Supply"

Modern-day ICD systems use transvenous high-voltage leads to act as the interface between the heart and the generator, allowing for the sensing of a cardiac activity and the delivery of both bradycardia and tachycardia therapy, including high-voltage, high-current shocks. The ICD lead is in many ways the most fragile and critical component of the ICD system, and is subjected to more stress than any other implanted medical device. It has similar components to a pacing lead including tip and ring electrodes, fixation mechanism, conductors, insulators, and connector pins. In addition, it also contains the high-voltage shock coils that allow the delivery of defibrillation therapy to the cardiac tissue. The materials used to manufacture each of these components have undergone little evolution from their initial pacing lead-derived origin, but promising progress in this area is now occurring and better conductors and insulators have been developed. Lead body design continues to be multiluminal rather than coaxial, but various iterations of this basic paradigm continue to be investigated. In addition to miniaturization of the entire ICD lead, new industry standard lead connectors will also be introduced to reduce complexity and pocket bulk. However, long-term failure rates have been considerable, with lead failure related to both conductor and insulator malfunction.

The pCF2-Ser mimic may be site-specifically incorporated into peptides (SPPS) and proteins (expressed protein ligation). This isopolar, dianionic pSer mimic results in a ""constitutive phosphorylation"" phenotype and is seen to support native protein-protein interactions that depend on serine phosphorylation. Signal transduction pathways studied with this chemical biological approach include the regulation of p53 tumor suppressor protein activity and of melatonin production.

The response of the human host to infectious agents forms a double edged sword of immunity. The immune system has to keep a tight balance between attack on foreign surfaces and protection of host surfaces. In its proper function the immune response is aimed to recognize, attack and eliminate invading infectious agents and this response is beneficial for the host. However when the activated immune response like the complement system is not properly controlled and deregulated, effector compounds can attack and damage self-surfaces and this results in disease. In addition pathogens which cause infections and disease protect themselves from the damaging and harmful host immune weapon and use specific immune escape strategies. The complement system forms the first defense line of innate immunity and aids in the elimination of microbes and modified self-cells. Defective regulation of this cascade type system results in infections and in pathology.

OBPP often has medicolegal implications. In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland the incidence is 0.42, in the United States 1.5, and in other western countries 1 to 3 per 1000 live births. Most infants with OBPP have no known risk factors. Shoulder dystocia increases the risk for OBPP 100-fold. The reported incidence of OBPP after shoulder dystocia varies widely from 4% to 40%. Other risk factors include birth weight >4 kg, maternal diabetes mellitus, obesity or excessive weight gain, prolonged pregnancy, prolonged second stage of labor, persistent fetal malposition, operative delivery, and breech extraction of a small baby. OBPP after caesarean section accounts for 1 % to 4% of cases. Historically, OBPPs have been considered to result from excessive lateral traction and forceful deviation of the fetal head from the axial plane of the fetal body, usually in association with shoulder dystocia, which increases the necessary applied peak force and time to deliver the fetal shoulders. Direct compression of the fetal shoulder on the symphysis pubis may also cause injury. However a significant proportion of OBPPs occurs in utero, as according to some studies more than half of the cases are not associated with shoulder dystocia. Possible mechanisms of intrauterine injury include the endogenous propulsive forces of labor, intrauterine maladaptation, or failure of the shoulders to rotate, and impaction of the posterior shoulder behind the sacral promontory. Uterine anomalies, such as fibroids, an intrauterine septum, or a bicornuate uterus may also result in OBPP. It is not possible to reliably predict which fetuses will experience OBPP. Future research should be directed in prospective evaluation of the mechanisms of injury, to enable obstetricians, midwives, and other health care professionals to identify modifiable risk factors, develop preventive strategies, and improve perinatal outcomes.

By contrast, man-made fluorine-containing derivatives of all major classes of biologically important compounds are extremely promising medicinal targets used in the elucidation of biochemical, metabolic transformations and the development of new pharmaceuticals. Among the fluorine-containing derivatives of natural products, fluorinated analogs of amino acids are of particular interest and medicinal potential. This article presents a concise review of various synthetic methods, developed by the Kievs school of bioorganic chemistry, for the preparation of fluorine-containing analogs of α- and β-amino acids, α-hydroxy acids, amines, as well as their phosphorus and sulfur-derived compounds, in enantiomerically pure form. One of the major methodological goals of the study was practicality, which is understood by us as stereochemical generality, operational convenience and synthetic affordance for each reaction step and isolation of the target products. The synthetic methods developed by our group can be roughly divided in two general categories: fluorine-adaptation of known synthetic approaches and discovery of new reactions. The former approach is most prominently represented by asymmetric homologation of nucleophilic glycine equivalents using fluorinated substrates via alkyl halide alkylations, aldol and Michael addition reactions. A plethora of discovered unexpected reaction outcomes, in particular stereochemical, are emphasized in this review and the particular role of fluorine, in altering the 'normal reaction result, is explained. The latter direction is notably represented by the novel 1,3-proton shift reaction, a biomimetic reductive amination of fluorinated carbonyl compounds to the corresponding amines and amino acids, as well as the development of α-fluoroalkyl epoxides as true fluorinated synthons for generalized asymmetric synthesis of various biologically relevant compounds. Despite the highly anticipated potential of fluorine-containing amino compounds, their medicinal chemistry still remains underexplored. The major obstacle, in our opinion, is that these selectively fluorinated compounds are generally unavailable to the medicinal chemists for comprehensive, systematic study. We hope this review of synthetic methods will highlight and bring attention to particular types of fluorinated amino acids and related compounds readily available on a laboratory scale using methods developed by our group. © 2009 Future Science Ltd.","2 hydroxyacid; acetic acid derivative; alpha amino acid; amine; amino acid; aminoalcohol; beta amino acid; beta,beta,beta (trifluoro)alanine; carbonyl derivative; epoxide; fluorine; isocyanoacetic acid derivative; nickel complex; phosphorus derivative; pyruvic acid derivative; sulfur derivative; trifluoropyruvic acid; unclassified drug; aldol reaction; alkylation; catalysis; drug structure; drug synthesis; enantiomer; fluorination; Michael addition; priority journal; review; stereochemistry; Ukraine; Amino Acids; Biological Products; Fluorine; Halogenation; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Stereoisomerism"

Extremely weakly coordinating anions based on perfluorophenyl borates allow the synthesis and structural characterization of complexes in which cation-anion interactions are minimized. The metals are therefore able to coordinate weakly donating ligands without the structural distortions and limitations in coordination geometry that are always encountered when coordinating anions are present. This has led to the isolation of thallium mono-, bis- and tris-arene complexes, thallium-ferrocene multidecker structures and the determination of their bond energies. New types of ether and crown ether adducts, as well as the first examples of cationic alkylzinc derivatives have become similarly accessible. These ionic Zn compounds very effectively polymerize cyclic esters and epoxides. Arene coordination is also a feature of strongly Lewis acidic bis(perfluoroaryl)zinc compounds, which when combined with activated alkyl chlorides provide an excellent new type of initiator for the homo and copolymerization of isoalkenes. These systems have given rise to a new family of elastomer materials. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

A large number of EDs are relatively polar compounds that pass easily wastewater treatments and reach the aquatic environment, where they can exert undesirable effects on both wildlife and humans. Their removal during waste-water treatment, very often inefficient, is usually estimated from the comparison of the concentrations detected at the influent and the effluent and the technique of choice for their analysis is in many cases liquid chromatography - (tandem)mass spectrometry (LC - (tandem)MS).

Studies in animal I/R models, including intestinal, hindlimb, kidney, and myocardial I/R models, have established a key role of the complement system in mediation of I/R injury using complement inhibitors and knock-out animal models. As complement activation has been shown to be an early event in I/R injury, inhibiting its activation or its components may offer tissue protection after reperfusion. However, clinical study results using complement inhibitors have largely been disappointing. Therefore, identification of a more specific pathogenic target for therapeutic intervention seems to be warranted. For this purpose more detailed knowledge of the responsible pathway of complement activation in I/R injury is required. Recent evidence from in vitro and in vivo models suggests involvement of both the classic and the lectin pathways in I/R injury via exposition of neo-epitopes in ischemic membranes. However, most of these findings have been obtained in knock-out murine models and have for a large part remained unconfirmed in the human setting. The observation that the relative role of each pathway seems to differ among organs complicates matters further. Whether a defective complement system protects from I/R injury in humans remains largely unknown. Most importantly, involvement of mannose-binding lectin as the main initiator of the lectin pathway has not been demonstrated at tissue level in human I/R injury to date. Thus, conclusions drawn from animal I/R studies should be extrapolated to the human setting with caution.

Tentative attempts of human dialysis in the decade that followed based on the vividiffusion apparatus of Abel and his materials (collodion, hirudin, and glass) met with failure and had to be abandoned. Practical dialysis became possible in the 1940s and thereafter after cellophane, heparin, and teflon became available.

Because of their persistence and their potential to accumulate they are of toxicological concern. The present review presents the current knowledge of PFC monitoring data in environmental media relevant for human exposure. In this context, PFC concentrations in indoor and ambient air, house dust, drinking water and food are outlined. Furthermore, we summarize human biomonitoring data of PFC levels in blood, breast milk, and human tissues. An estimate of the overall exposure of the general adult population is provided and compared with tolerable intake values. Using a simplified model, the average (and upper) level of daily exposure including all potential routes amounts to 1.6 ng/kgbody weight (8.8 ng/kgbody weight) for PFOS and 2.9 ng/kgbody weight (12.6 ng/kgbody weight) for PFOA in adults in the general population. The majority of exposure can be attributed to the oral route, mainly to diet. Overall, the contribution of PFOS and PFOA precursors to total exposure seems to be limited. Besides this background exposure of the general population, a specific additional exposure may occur which causes an increased PFC body burden. This has been observed in populations living near PFC production facilities or in areas with environmental contamination of PFCs. The consumption of highly contaminated fish products may also cause an increase in PFC body burdens. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Results from generic multimedia box models, spatially resolved multimedia box models, and atmospheric transport models are highlighted, including conceptual investigations of cold-trap effect and global fractionation as well as results for particular chemicals, such as hexachlorocyclohexanes, DDT, polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluoroocctanoic acid, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Comparison of model results to field data shows that in many cases environmental fate models provide a good description of the distribution dynamics observed in the field, with deviations between measured and modeled concentrations around a factor of five. Sorption to atmospheric aerosols as a key process influencing the LRT of semivolatile organic chemicals (SOCs) is discussed, and the need for more measurements of the aerosol-air partitioning of SOCs and of the reactivity of particle-bound chemicals is pointed out. Key findings from field campaigns measuring legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) as well as new POPs are summarized. Finally, the relationship between science and politics in the field of POPs is addressed. Research into the LRT of organic chemicals has always occurred in interaction with political activities aiming to reduce the emissions of POPs. Since the late 1990s, the Stockholm Convention and the Aarhus Protocol on POPs have formed an important political context for research concerning POPs; the implementation of these international treaties creates a demand for ongoing research into the LRT of organic chemicals. © 2009 SETAC.","Atmospheric transport models; Box models; Environmental fate models; Environmental fates; Field campaigns; Field datum; Hexachlorocyclohexanes; International treaties; Key process; Long-range transport; Model results; Persistent organic pollutants Current-use pesticides; Political activities; Political contexts; Poly-brominated diphenyl ethers; Spatially resolved; Stockholm; Transboundary air pollution; Trap effects; Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; Ethers; Industrial chemicals; Organic pollutants; Pesticides; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Sorption; Organic chemicals; chlorphenotane; hexachlorocyclohexane; organic compound; perfluorooctanoic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; DDT; environmental fate; environmental modeling; fractionation; HCH; long range transport; organic pollutant; PBDE; PCB; sorption; volatile organic compound; aerosol; air pollution control; atmospheric transport; controlled study; fractionation; model; organic pollution; pollution transport; priority journal; review; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Models, Chemical; Organic Chemicals"

The review is an update of a similar, earlier review in this journal [T.A. van Beek, J. Chromatogr. A 967 (2002) 21-55]. Since 2001 over 3000 papers on Ginkgo biloba have appeared, and about 400 of them pertain to chemical analysis in a broad sense and are cited herein. The more important ones are discussed and, where relevant, compared with the best methods published prior to 2002. In the same period over 2500 patents were filed on Ginkgo and the very few related to analysis are mentioned as well. Important constituents include terpene trilactones, i.e. ginkgolide A, B, C, J and bilobalide, flavonol glycosides, biflavones, proanthocyanidins, alkylphenols, simple phenolic acids, 6-hydroxykynurenic acid, 4-O-methylpyridoxine and polyprenols. In the most common so-called ""standardised"" Ginkgo extracts and phytopharmaceuticals several of these classes are no longer present. About 130 new papers deal with the analysis of the terpene trilactones. They are mostly extracted with methanol or water or mixtures thereof. Supercritical fluid extraction and pressurised water extraction are also possible. Sample clean-up is mostly by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate although no sample clean-up at all in combination with LC/MS/MS is gaining in importance. Separation and detection can be routinely carried out by RP-HPLC with ELSD, RI or MS, or by GC/FID or GC/MS after silylation. Hydrolysis followed by LC/MS allows the simultaneous analysis of terpene trilactones and flavonol aglycones. No quantitative procedure for all major flavonol glycosides has yet been published because they are not commercially available. The quantitation of a few available glycosides has been carried out but does not serve a real purpose. After acidic hydrolysis to the aglycones quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin and separation by HPLC, quantitation is straightforward and yields by recalculation an estimation of the original total flavonol glycoside content. A profile of the genuine flavonol glycosides can detect poor storage or adulteration. Although the toxicity of Ginkgo alkylphenols upon oral administration has never been undoubtedly proven, most suppliers limit their content in extracts to 5 ppm and dozens of papers on their analysis were published. One procedure in which a methanolic extract is directly injected on a C8 HPLC column appears superior in terms of sensitivity (<5 ppm), separation, simplicity and validation and will be incorporated in the European Pharmacopoeia. Alternatively GC/MS and ELISA methods can be used. A sharp contrast to the plethora of papers on terpene trilactones, flavonol glycosides, and ginkgolic acids forms the low number of papers on biflavones, proanthocyanidins, simple phenolics, simple acids, and other constituents that make up the remaining 70% of Ginkgo standardised extracts. More research in this direction is clearly needed. For the analysis of Ginkgo proanthocyanidins (7%) for instance, no reliable assays are yet existing. Finally the growing literature on pharmacokinetic and fingerprinting studies of Ginkgo is briefly summarised. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Hereditary platelet function disorders (PFDs) are at least as prevalent in the general population as von Willebrand disease (VWD) although PFDs tend not be as well recognized or evaluated. Clinical mucous and skin bleeding in patients with PFDs is prototypic of primary hemostasis disorders, and the bleeding pattern is not distinguishable from that of other primary hemostasis disorders such as VWD. However, different treatment needs, between these discrete disorders, make a precise diagnosis mandatory. Currently, clinicians receive reliable laboratory reports when testing patients with severe PFDs, such as Glanzmann thrombasthenia and Bernard-Soulier syndrome, due to the distinctive laboratory defects that these disorders present, together with the availability of differential diagnostic tests. This is not the case for the majority of PFDs generically classified as ""platelet secretion disorders,"" which are a heterogeneous group of ""mild bleeding disorders,"" for which there are not universally accepted diagnostic criteria. An important reason for robust diagnostic tests is the high proportion (more than 50% in some reports) of patients with unequivocal bleeding who have no precise diagnosis established after a complete laboratory workup. It is paradoxical that the current ""gold standard"" test for PFD diagnosis, light transmission aggregometry (LTA), has not been standardized after more than four decades of worldwide clinical use. This review describes current diagnostic assays for PFD in a clinical hemostasis laboratory, relating these with current knowledge on platelet function and pathophysiology. Special emphasis will be given to LTA and platelet secretion tests, as well as to the reasons why sensitive tests are needed to explore the lesser known participation of platelets in blood clotting and fibrinolytic processes.

This is due to the inhibition of proliferation of lymphocytes and the production of inflammatory cytokines of the TH1, TH2, and TH17 cells as well as the induction of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and interleukin (IL)-1RA. Until recently, most of the effects of these inhibitors on immune functions were attributed to the inhibition of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPIV/CD26). With the identification of new peptidases of the DPIV family (DASH) with the same or similar substrate specificity [fibroblast activation protein (FAP), DP8/9], the question arose whether and to what extent the inhibition of intracellularly localized enzymes, DP8 and DP9, contribute to the observed immunosuppression. In addition, members of the aminopeptidase N (APN) family are also involved in the regulation of immune functions. Hence, the concept of a combined targeting of both families of peptidases for treatment of inflammatory diseases is a promising strategy. Results/Conclusions: Summarizing data obtained from the usage of different non-selective and selective inhibitors of DPIV, DP8/9, FAP, and DPII, this review provides evidence that in addition to DPIV, DP8/9 also regulate the immune response via modulation of cell cycle progression and cytokine production. The strongest and most consistent effects in vitro were, however, observed with non-selective inhibitors for the suppression of DNA synthesis and cytokine production. Similar effects were provoked by APN inhibitors, which were also found to suppress DNA synthesis and the production of inflammatory cytokines in vitro. However, different mechanisms and signaling pathways appear to mediate the cellular effects resulting from the inhibition of either APN or DPIV family members. In particular, members of the APN family uniquely influence the function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cells. Consequently, the concomitant inhibition of both APN and DPIV enzyme families by means of two separate inhibitors or by binary inhibitors with specificity for both enzyme families (PETIR™, peptidase targeted immunoregulation) synergistically affects immune cells on the level of cell cycle regulation, suppression of TH1, TH2, and TH17 cytokines as well as the activation of regulatory T-cells. Besides leukocytes, dermal cells as sebocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts are also targeted by these inhibitors. This strongly suggests a broad potential of the multiple anti-inflammatory effects of PETIR™ in treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, allergies, and transplant rejections, as well as of inflammatory skin diseases, such as acne, psoriasis, rosacea or atopic dermatitis. The first active dual inhibitor, IP10.C8, has been developed by IMTM for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases and has just entered the first phase II study. © 2009 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin New York.","dipeptidyl peptidase; dipeptidyl peptidase 8; dipeptidyl peptidase 9; dipeptidyl peptidase IV; fibroblast activation protein; interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; microsomal aminopeptidase; serine proteinase; transforming growth factor beta1; unclassified drug; CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocyte; cell cycle progression; cell proliferation; cytokine production; DNA synthesis; enzyme inhibition; enzyme localization; enzyme specificity; fibroblast; immune response; inflammatory disease; keratinocyte; lymphocyte; nonhuman; priority journal; review; signal transduction; skin inflammation; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; tissue distribution; Animals; Antigens, CD13; Antigens, CD26; Humans; Protease Inhibitors; Skin Diseases"

We found that the levels of contamination by these compounds had unique patterns in Japan. The levels of PFOA in serum from inhabitants of the Kansai region were higher than those of other regions. The PFOA levels in air and water samples from the Kansai region were also relatively high. The estimated intakes from these routes partly explain the differences in the serum levels. The toxicokinetics of these compounds have been investigated. Serum samples from male participants had significantly higher geometric means for PFOS and PFOA compared to samples from female participants. This sex-related difference was partly simulated by menstrual blood loss. There are large interspecies differences in the excretion pathways of these compounds. The serum clearances of PFOA via urine were 300-1,000-fold lower in humans than in Wistar rats and Japanese macaques. On the other hand, the biliary excretion of these compounds was comparable in rats and humans, and the long half-lives in humans may be attributable to the low levels of urinary excretion and high biliary reabsorption rates. These findings suggest that qualitative differences in the excretion routes exist between humans and other species. For risk assessment of these compounds, further information regarding sources of exposure and their toxicokinetics is needed. © 2008 The Japanese Society for Hygiene.","perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; animal experiment; biliary excretion; biological monitoring; blood level; carcinogenicity; environmental exposure; female; half life time; human; Japan; liver toxicity; Macaca; male; menstruation; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; occupational exposure; rat; reproductive toxicity; review; risk assessment; sex difference; species difference; toxicity; toxicokinetics; urinary excretion; Macaca; Rattus; Rattus norvegicus"

The interest in FTS depends on current and perceived future prices of crude oil but is increasingly viewed as an option for exploiting stranded natural gas. Other advantages of FTS hydrocarbons include the absence of sulphur, nitrogen, heavy metal contaminants, low aromatic content and the ability to produce high value middle distillates/fuels. Current interest is directed towards slurry bubble processes - comprising gas, liquid, and solid phases. Industrial slurry phase FTS reactors may range in size from 6 - 10 m in diameter and upwards of 30 m in height and include multiple internal heat transfer tubes. Such systems offer numerous advantages including high heat transfer rates, good mixing, and ease of online catalyst addition and withdrawal. However, one disadvantage is the complex hydrodynamics associated with slurry bubble columns, which make scale-up difficult. A literature review on heat transfer studies and correlations has been completed focusing on previous experimental setups, the synthesis of the key findings/parameters, and the identification of the necessary criteria required for reactor design and scale-up. The parameters having the most pronounced impact on heat transfer in slurry bubble columns and three-phase fluidized beds are the superficial gas velocity and liquid properties such as viscosity and surface tension, which significantly alter the bubble properties and the column hydrodynamics. The effect of particles is poorly understood and is a complex function of particle diameter and concentration. The experimental results and correlations reported here from the majority of studies are dependent upon the equipment and properties of the three phases studied - resulting in very limited applicability to other systems or for scale-up. Other concerns include the use of relatively low gas velocities, ambient temperature and pressure, relatively large particles, and relatively small columns employed in most studies, which are not relevant to industrial operating conditions. Furthermore, studies involving multiple internals were relatively few. Most columns were only equipped with a single tube or small heat flux probe thereby measuring only the local heat transfer and not taking into account the effect on column hydrodynamics of multiple internals. Of these studies only a few tubes were equipped with heaters (that did not run the entire tube length) and heat flux probes while the remaining probes were inactive. © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

Evaluations of different configurations of the organic denuder, and SVOC determined by different denuder-based samplers, both integrated and semi-continuous, are reviewed. A new equation for determination of the denuder efficiency is estimated, considering the efficiency of removing both the gaseous organics that could be adsorbed by the quartz and the gaseous passing through the quartz that could be subsequently adsorbed by the backup adsorbent filter. The origin of OC on the backup quartz filter, behind either quartz or Teflon filter, is quantitatively evaluated by the denuder-based method based on the data published.

These compounds have been reported to cause adverse impacts on wildlife and human. However, compared to the studies on hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) whose sorption characteristics is reviewed in Part IV of this review series, information on PPCPs is very limited. Thus, a summary of recent research progress on PPCP sorption in soils or sediments is necessary to clarify research requirements and directions. Main features: We reviewed the research progress on PPCP sorption in soils or sediments highlighting PPCP sorption different from that of HOCs. Special function of humic substances (HSs) on PPCP behavior is summarized according to several features of PPCP-soil or sediment interaction. In addition, we discussed the behavior of xenobiotic chemicals in a three-phase system (dissolved organic matter (DOM)-mineral-water). The complexity of three-phase systems was also discussed. Results: Nonideal sorption of PPCPs in soils or sediments is generally reported, and PPCP sorption behavior is relatively a more complicated process compared to HOC sorption, such as the contribution of inorganic fractions, fast degradation and metabolite sorption, and species-specific sorption mechanism. Thus, mechanistic studies are urgently needed for a better understanding of their environmental risk and for pollution control. Discussion: Recent research progress on nonideal sorption has not been incorporated into fate modeling of xenobiotic chemicals. A major reason is the complexity of the three-phase system. First of all, lack of knowledge in describing DOM fractionation after adsorption by mineral particles is one of the major restrictions for an accurate prediction of xenobiotic chemical behavior in the presence of DOM. Secondly, no explicit mathematical relationship between HS chemical-physical properties, and their sorption characteristics has been proposed. Last but not least, nonlinear interactions could exponentially increase the complexity and uncertainties of environmental fate models for xenobiotics. Discussion on proper simplification of fate modeling in the framework of nonlinear interactions is still unavailable. Although the methodologies and concepts for studying HOC environmental fate could be adopted for PPCP study, their differences should be highly understood. Prediction of PPCP environmental behavior needs to combine contributions from various fractions of soils or sediments and the sorption of their metabolites and different species. Recommendations and perspectives: More detailed studies on PPCP sorption in separated soil or sediment fractions are needed in order to propose a model predicting PPCP sorption in soils or sediments based on soil or sediment properties. The information on sorption of PPCP metabolites and species and the competition between them is still not enough to be incorporated into any predictive models. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","cosmetic; drug; organic compound; dissolved organic matter; drug; endocrine disruptor; environmental risk; humic substance; hydrophobicity; metabolite; organic pollutant; pollution control; pollution effect; sorption; xenobiotics; chemistry; pollutant; review; sediment; Cosmetics; Environmental Pollutants; Geologic Sediments; Organic Chemicals; Pharmaceutical Preparations"

These compounds can trigger biological activity by activating the alpha isotype of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate gene expression; however, some biological effects may occur independently of the receptor. Activation of the peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor alpha (PPARα) modulates lipid and glucose homeostasis, cell proliferation and differentiation, and inflammation. Reported immunomodulation in experimental animals exposed to PFOA and PFOS has included altered inflammatory responses, production of cytokines and other proteins, reduced lymphoid organ weights, and altered antibody synthesis. Mounting experimental animal evidence suggests PPARα independence of some immune effects. This evidence originates primarily from studies with PPARα knockout models exposed to PFOA that demonstrate hepatic peroxisome proliferation, reduced lymphoid organ weights, and altered antibody synthesis. As human PPARα expression is significantly less than that of rodents, potential PPARα independence indicates that future research must explore mechanisms of action of these compounds, including PPARα -dependent and -independent pathways.

Formamidopyrimidines, 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyAde) and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua), are among the major lesions generated in DNA by hydroxyl radical attack, UV radiation, or photosensitization under numerous in vitro and in vivo conditions. They are formed by one-electron reduction of C8-OH-adduct radicals of purines and thus have a common precursor with 8-hydroxypurines generated upon one-electron oxidation. Methodologies using mass spectrometry exist to accurately measure FapyAde and FapyGua in vitro and in vivo. Formamidopyrimidines are repaired by base excision repair. Numerous prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA glycosylases are highly specific for removal of these lesions from DNA in the first step of this repair pathway, indicating their biological importance. FapyAde and FapyGua are bypassed by DNA polymerases with the insertion of the wrong intact base opposite them, leading to mutagenesis. In mammalian cells, the mutagenicity of FapyGua exceeds that of 8-hydroxyguanine, which is thought to be the most mutagenic of the oxidatively induced lesions in DNA. The background and formation levels of the former in vitro and in vivo equal or exceed those of the latter under various conditions. FapyAde and FapyGua exist in living cells at significant background levels and are abundantly generated upon exposure to oxidative stress. Mice lacking the genes that encode specific DNA glycosylases accumulate these lesions in different organs and, in some cases, exhibit a series of pathological conditions including metabolic syndrome and cancer. Animals exposed to environmental toxins accumulate formamidopyrimidines in their organs. Here, we extensively review the mechanisms of formation, measurement, repair, and biological effects of formamidopyrimidines that have been investigated in the past 50 years. Our goal is to emphasize the importance of these neglected lesions in many biological and disease processes.","2,6 diamino 4 hydroxy 5 formamidopyrimidine; 4,6 diamino 5 formamidopyrimidine; 8 hydroxyguanine; DNA glycosyltransferase; hydroxyl radical; pyrimidine derivative; unclassified drug; carcinogenesis; DNA damage; enzyme specificity; excision repair; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; mass spectrometry; metabolic syndrome X; mutagenesis; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidative stress; photosensitization; priority journal; reduction; review; ultraviolet radiation; DNA; DNA Repair; DNA-Formamidopyrimidine Glycosylase; Humans; Pyrimidines; Animalia; Eukaryota; Mammalia; Mus; Prokaryota"

Hypoxia is a significant problem in the treatment of all types of solid tumours and a common reason for treatment failure. Hypoxia is a negative prognostic indicator of survival and is correlated with the development of metastatic disease. Resistance to radiation therapy and chemotherapy can be because of hypoxia. There are two dominant types of hypoxia recognized in tumours, static and intermittent. Both types of hypoxia are important in terms of resistance. A variety of physiological factors cause hypoxia, and in turn, hypoxia can induce genetic and physiological changes. A limited number of studies have documented that hypoxia exists in spontaneous canine tumours.

A biorefinery based on palm oil and oil palm biomass for the production of biofuels has been proposed. The catalytic technology plays major role in the different processing stages in a biorefinery for the production of liquid as well as gaseous biofuels. There are number of challenges to find suitable catalytic technology to be used in a typical biorefinery. These challenges include (1) economic barriers, (2) catalysts that facilitate highly selective conversion of substrate to desired products and (3) the issues related to design, operation and control of catalytic reactor. Therefore, the catalytic technology is one of the critical factors that control the successful operation of biorefinery. There are number of catalytic processes in a biorefinery which convert the renewable feedstocks into the desired biofuels. These include biodiesel production from palm oil, catalytic cracking of palm oil for the production of biofuels, the production of hydrogen as well as syngas from biomass gasification, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) for the conversion of syngas into liquid fuels and upgrading of liquid/gas fuels obtained from liquefaction/pyrolysis of biomass. The selection of catalysts for these processes is essential in determining the product distribution (olefins, paraffins and oxygenated products). The integration of catalytic technology with compatible separation processes is a key challenge for biorefinery operation from the economic point of view. This paper focuses on different types of catalysts and their role in the catalytic processes for the production of biofuels in a typical palm oil and oil palm biomass-based biorefinery. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We show how the optoelectronic properties may be tuned by varying the amount of bridging between one bridge per two phenylenes in polyfluorenes through to completely bridged ladder-type polyphenylenes, and by changing the nature of the substituents at the bridgeheads. Of particular importance is the suppression of undesirable long wavelength emission by controlling interchain interactions and choosing synthetic methods so as to hinder or prevent the formation of emissive defects. The electroluminescence efficiency of these materials can also be enhanced by the use of charge-transporting substituents.

Hole- and electron-injection barriers can be effectively lowered by the insertion of hole-transport and electron-injection layers, respectively. The recent development of PFs with various emission colors, via physical blending or chemical modification, are presented for a comprehensive understanding of PFs for device applications.

Due to high activity and long catalyst life, cobalt-based catalyst is currently the catalyst of choice for gas to liquid (GTL) technology. Water is most undesirable byproduct of FTS process. Due to low water-gas-shift (WGS) activity of cobalt-based catalyst, the water concentration rises with time-on-stream (TOS) in FTS. This paper reviews the effects of water on the performances of various cobalt catalysts for FTS. The effects of water on FTS is quite complex and depends on the support and its nature, Co metal loading, its promotion with noble metals, and preparation procedure. Added water up to certain concentrations has positive effects (in terms of higher CO conversion, C5+ selectivity, olefin selectivity and lower methane and CO2 selectivity) on unsupported cobalt oxide catalysts. If the effects of support are taken into account, water has positive effect for silica-supported catalysts. The effects are negative for alumina where as for titania support, water has little positive effect. However in general, oxidation of cobalt active site depending on the cluster size and water partial pressure, the removal of transport restrictions via the formation of water-rich intra-pellet liquids, and kinetic effects have been considered as the main responsible factors. The effects are strongly influenced by the cobalt cluster size as well as on pore size of the support. Addition of noble metals at low cobalt loading increases the dispersion of cobalt on the support and hence improves its activity. Higher cobalt dispersion enhances the negative impact of water especially at higher water partial pressures under FTS conditions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To facilitate the evaluation of the environmental behavior of APE and an assessment of their PBT characteristics, a review of the physical-chemical properties and environmental degradation pathways was performed. The most widely used commercial APE are highly water soluble and non-volatile. Nonylphenol (NP) and octylphenol (OP) are relatively low solubility compounds that are more hydrophilic and volatile than the ethoxylates. Properties of ethoxylate degradation intermediates such as APE1,2 are between values for the commercial APE and the AP building blocks in terms of solubility and partitioning characteristics and are non-volatile at ambient temperatures. The ether carboxylate intermediates are ionic in neutral water solution; hence, they are non-volatile and less prone to partitioning to organic matter. Under aerobic conditions, commercial APE undergo rapid degradation to short chain ethoxylates and ether carboxylates, which in turn degrade ultimately to carbon dioxide and water. Under anaerobic conditions, APE degrade more slowly, and may result in some accumulation of AP. Degradation half-lives and the potential for these compounds to bioaccumulate will be examined in a companion article. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Heavier than water intraocular tamponades have been developed to improve inferior tamponading properties. In addition to inferior PVR, there seem to be other applications such as persistent macular holes or PVR in trauma eyes. Materials and methods: Review of the literature on clinical application of heavy tamponades. The review also discusses the theoretical background of heavy tamponades and possible future developments. Results: The parameters of an optimal intraocular tamponade are defined, and the influences of the specific gravity, buoyancy, interfacial tension, and viscosity are discussed. Perfluorocarbon liquids and partially fluorinated alkanes were associated with tamponade emulsification, intraocular inflammation, and rise in intraocular pressure that was less prominent in admixtures of these substances with silicone oil (heavy silicone oils). Two recently developed heavy silicone oil tamponades, Oxane HD and Densiron 68, are well-tolerated and have entered clinical practice. The side effects are associated with the chemical properties of the tamponading agent, and seem comparable to the ones seen with conventional silicone oil. Conclusion: Heavy silicone oil tamponade improves inferior tamponade, and may be considered a new generation of intraocular tamponades. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","fluorinated hydrocarbon; fluorocarbon; silicone oil; clinical effectiveness; clinical trial; emulsion; eye inflammation; human; interface pressure; intraocular hypertension; physical chemistry; priority journal; relative density; retina detachment; retina disease; retina macula hole; retina tear; review; viscosity; vitreoretinopathy; Animals; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Retinal Diseases; Silicone Oils; Specific Gravity; Surface Tension; Viscosity"

Mechanisms of formation of these unique tandem lesions were elucidated. The 8,5′-cyclization causes an unusual puckering of the sugar moiety giving rise to significant distortion in the DNA double helix. Methodologies were developed for the measurement of these lesions in DNA by mass spectrometry coupled either with gas chromatography or high performance liquid chromatography. Both techniques allowed identification and quantification of both R- and S-diastereomers of cdA and cdG in DNA in vitro and in vivo. Because of the 8,5′-covalent bond between the sugar and base moieties in the same nucleoside, cdA and cdG are repaired by nucleotide excision repair rather than by base excision repair. Thus, these lesions may play a role in diseases with defective nucleotide excision repair. Their biological effects include blocking DNA polymerases, inhibition of gene expression, transcriptional mutagenesis among others. Accumulation of cdA and cdG was observed in tissues in vivo in connection to disease and environmental conditions, suggesting an important role for these lesions in disease processes including carcinogenesis and neuronal death. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.","5',8 cyclodeoxyguanosine; 8,5' cyclo 2' deoxyadenosine; deoxyadenosine; deoxyadenosine derivative; deoxyguanosine; deoxyguanosine derivative; DNA polymerase; hydroxyl radical; 5',8 cyclodeoxyguanosine; 8,5' cyclo 2' deoxyadenosine; 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyadenosine; 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyguanosine; deoxyguanosine; DNA; drug derivative; unclassified drug; breast cancer; cell regeneration; chemical structure; Cockayne syndrome; covalent bond; cyclization; diastereoisomer; DNA determination; DNA helix; DNA repair; DNA structure; excision repair; familial Mediterranean fever; gas chromatography; gene expression; gene mutation; high performance liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; priority journal; review; stereospecificity; structure analysis; xeroderma pigmentosum; animal; chemistry; conformation; DNA repair; gene expression regulation; human; liquid chromatography; mass fragmentography; mouse; Animals; Chromatography, Liquid; Deoxyadenosines; Deoxyguanosine; DNA; DNA Repair; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Hydroxyl Radical; Mass Spectrometry; Mice; Nucleic Acid Conformation"

Fructans are fructose-based polymers synthesized from sucrose by fructosyltransferases (FTs). They have been increasingly recognized as protective agents against abiotic stresses. Using model membranes, numerous in vitro studies have demonstrated that fructans can stabilize membranes by direct H-bonding to the phosphate and choline groups of membrane lipids, resulting in a reduced water outflow from the dry membranes. Inulin-type fructans are flexible random-coiled structures that can adopt many conformations, allowing them to insert deeply within the membranes. The devitrification temperature (T g) can be adjusted by their varying molecular weights. In addition, above Tg their low crystallization rates ensure prolonged membrane protection. Supporting, in vivo studies with transgenic plants expressing FTs showed fructan accumulation and an associated improvement in freezing and/or chilling tolerance. The water-soluble nature of fructans may allow their rapid adaptation as cryoprotectants in order to give optimal membrane protection. One of the emerging concepts for delivering vacuolar fructans to the extracellular space for protecting the plasma membrane is vesicle-mediated, tonoplast-derived exocytosis. It should, however, be noted that natural stress tolerance is a very complex process that cannot be explained by the action of a single molecule or mechanism. © The Author [2008].

In the latter type, a drug that is either embedded in polymeric or nonpolymeric coating(s) on the stent surface or directly attached to the stent surface elutes into the blood stream at a controlled rate over a period of time, typically 14-30 days. Over the years, there has been a steady decline in the use of PTCA and a concomitant sharp increase in the use of stents, with DESs being the predominant choice in the last 3 years.

In 1998, epoetin-associated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) was first reported and causation was attributed to formulations without human serum albumin (HSA), subcutaneous administration, and uncoated rubber stoppers. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on erythropoietin (EPO)-associated PRCA were obtained from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), regulatory authorities in other countries, and the manufacturers of epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, and darbepoetin. The data included information on numbers of PRCA cases and estimated exposure-adjusted incidence rates by EPO product, anemia etiology, administration route, country of PRCA identification, and date reported. RESULTS: In 1999, academicians in Paris identified 12 EPO-treated patients with antibody-mediated PRCA; 11 of these patients were on hemodialysis and had received subcutaneous Eprex (Johnson & Johnson). In 2002, authorities in Europe, Australia, Singapore, and Canada mandated Eprex by IV route to hemodialysis patients, and the relevant manufacturers added Teflon coating to prefilled syringes of Eprex; PRCA cases subsequently decreased by 90 percent. By 2003, 180 Eprex-associated PRCA cases were identified in Europe, Canada, Australia, and Asia, despite improvements in handling. Since 2002, FDA safety databases include information on 59 new cases of antibody-associated PRCA, primarily associated with subcutaneous epoetin alfa and darbepoetin that does not contain HSA. CONCLUSION: Independent actions by regulatory authorities, manufacturers, and academic researchers identified significant numbers of PRCA cases between 1998 and 2003 and characterized the probable etiology. Today, antibody-mediated PRCA is an infrequent class toxicity occurring among some hemodialysis patients on EPOs. © 2008 American Association of Blood Banks.","corticosteroid derivative; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporin; interferon; novel erythropoiesis stimulating protein; politef; polysorbate 80; prednisone; recombinant erythropoietin; ribavirin; rituximab; tacrolimus; anemia; Asia; Australia; Canada; chronic kidney disease; clinical trial; drug withdrawal; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Europe; food and drug administration; France; hemodialysis; hepatitis C; human; medical information; morbidity; nonhuman; outcome assessment; pure red cell anemia; radioimmunoassay; review; risk assessment; Singapore; Anemia; Drug Labeling; Drug Toxicity; Epoetin Alfa; Hematinics; Humans; Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure"

Bleeding control, maintenance of tissue oxygenation with fluid resuscitation, coagulation support, and maintenance of normothermia remain mainstays of therapy for patients with hemorrhagic shock. Although now widely practised as standard in the USA and Europe, shock resuscitation strategies involving blood replacement and fluid volume loading to regain tissue perfusion and oxygenation vary between trauma centers; the primary cause of this is the scarcity of published evidence and lack of randomized controlled clinical trials. Despite enormous efforts to improve outcomes after severe hemorrhage, novel strategies based on experimental data have not resulted in profound changes in treatment philosophy. Recent clinical and experimental studies indicated the important influences of sex and genetics on pathophysiological mechanisms after hemorrhage. Those findings might provide one explanation why several promising experimental approaches have failed in the clinical arena. In this respect, more clinically relevant animal models should be used to investigate pathophysiology and novel treatment approaches. This review points out new therapeutic strategies, namely immunomodulation, cardiovascular maintenance, small volume resuscitation, and so on, that have been introduced in clinics or are in the process of being transferred from bench to bedside. Control of hemorrhage in the earliest phases of care, recognition and monitoring of individual risk factors, and therapeutic modulation of the inflammatory immune response will probably constitute the next generation of therapy in hemorrhagic shock.

The presence of two opposing segments within one molecule makes semifluorinated alkanes a very interesting class of compounds, which show a particular behavior both in bulk and at interfaces. Their highly asymmetric structure, arising from the incompatibility of the both constituent parts, results in surface activity of these molecules (so-called primitive surfactants) when dissolved in organic solvents, and allows for the Langmuir monolayer formation if spread at the air/water interface, despite of the absence of any polar group.

In this paper, the research advances on the physicochemical properties, environmental sources, transportation and fate, and pollution trend of PFOA were briefly reviewed, and additional discussion was given to the priorities of future research on PFOA.","fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; organic pollutant; physicochemical property; pollutant transport; pollution control; pollution effect; pollution incidence; pollution monitoring; research work; risk assessment; surfactant; trend analysis; animal; pollutant; review; risk assessment; toxicity testing; Animals; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Octanoic Acids; Risk Assessment; Toxicity Tests; Eurasia; Europe; North America; United States; Animalia"

Using this islet isolation method, we isolated islets from 19 human pancreata of non-heart-beating donors and transplanted 16 preparations into seven patients with type 1 diabetes between April 7, 2004 and November 18, 2005. The percentage of those meeting the release criteria of the Edmonton Protocol was more than 80%. We also performed living-donor transplantation of islets for unstable diabetes on January 19, 2005.

Firstly, it was determined that the kidneys produce urine containing toxic substances that accumulate in the body if the kidneys fail to function properly; secondly, it was necessary to discover the process of diffusion and dialysis; thirdly, it was necessary to develop a safe method to prevent clotting in the extracorporeal circulation; and fourthly, it was necessary to develop biocompatible dialyzing membranes. Most of the essential knowledge was acquired by the end of the 19th century. Hemodialysis as a practical means of replacing kidney function started and developed in the 20th century. The original hemodialyzers, using celloidin as a dialyzing membrane and hirudin as an anticoagulant, were used in animal experiments at the beginning of the 20th century, and then there were a few attempts in humans in the 1920s. Rapid progress started with the application of cellophane membranes and heparin as an anticoagulant in the late 1930s and 1940s. The explosion of new dialyzer designs continued in the 1950s and 1960s and ended with the development of capillary dialyzers. Cellophane was replaced by other dialyzing membranes in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Dialysis solution was originally prepared in the tank from water, electrolytes, and glucose. This solution was recirculated through the dialyzer and back to the tank. In the 1960s, a method of single-pass dialysis solution preparation and delivery system was designed. A large quantity of dialysis solution was used for a single dialysis. Sorbent systems, using a small volume of regenerated dialysis solution, were developed in the mid 1960s, and continue to be used for home hemodialysis and acute renal failure. At the end of the 20th century, a new closed system, which prepared and delivered ultrapure dialysis solution preparation, was developed. This system also had automatic reuse of lines and dialyzers and prepared the machine for the next dialysis. This was specifically designed for quotidian home hemodialysis. Another system for frequent home hemodialysis or acute renal failure was developed at the turn of the 21st century. This system used premanufactured dialysis solution, delivered to the home or dialysis unit, as is done for peritoneal dialysis. © Journal compilation © 2008 International Society for Hemodialysis.","cellophane; cuprophane; dialysis fluid; electrolyte; glucose; heparin; hirudin; politef; poly(methyl methacrylate); pyroxylin; uremic toxin; water; acute kidney failure; anticoagulant therapy; artificial kidney; biocompatibility; blood clotting; dialysis membrane; diffusion; drug delivery system; extracorporeal circulation; hemodialysis; history of medicine; home care; human; kidney function; knowledge discovery; nonhuman; patient safety; peritoneal dialysis; recycling; renal replacement therapy; review; ultrafiltration; Equipment Design; Hemodialysis Solutions; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Kidney Failure; Kidney, Artificial; Renal Dialysis"

Secondly, the synthesis of dendritic hyperbranched poly(methyl methacrylate)s (PMMAs) and their functionalized block copolymers using a novel iterative methodology is described. The methodology involves a two-reaction sequence in each iterative process: (a) a linking reaction of α-functionalized living anionic PMMA with tert-butyldimethylsilyloxymethylphenyl (SMP) groups with benzyl bromide (BnBr)-chain-end-functionalized polymer and (b) a transformation reaction of the SMP groups into BnBr functions. This reaction sequence is repeated several times to construct high-generation (maximum seventh generation) dendritic hyperbranched polymers. Similar branched architectural block copolymers have also been synthesized by the same iterative methodology using other α-functionalized living anionic polymers. Surface structures of the resulting dendritic hyperbranched block copolymers composed of PMMA and poly(2-(perfluorobutyl)ethyl methacrylate) segments have been characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle measurements.

The most commonly detected PFAS, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), has been classified as a persistent and bioaccumulative substance. Similarities in chemical structure and environmental behavior of PFOS and the PFCAs that have been detected in wildlife have generated concerns about the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs. Differences between partitioning behavior of perfluorinated acids and persistent lipophilic compounds complicate the understanding of PFCA bioaccumulation and the subsequent classification of the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs according to existing regulatory criteria. Based on available research on the bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids, five key points are highlighted in this review: (1) bioconcentration and bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids are directly related to the length of each compound's fluorinated carbon chain; (2) PFASs are more bioaccumulative than PFCAs of the same fluorinated carbon chain length; (3) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (perfluorooctanoate (PFO) and shorter PFCAs) are not considered bioaccumulative according to the range of promulgated bioaccumulation, ""B"", regulatory criteria of 1000-5000 L/kg; (4) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less have low biomagnification potential in food webs, and (5) more research is necessary to fully characterize the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains (>7 fluorinated carbons), as PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains may exhibit partitioning behavior similar to or greater than PFOS. The bioaccumulation potential of perfluorinated acids with seven fluorinated carbons or less appears to be several orders of magnitude lower than ""legacy"" persistent lipophilic compounds classified as bioaccumulative. Thus, although many PFCAs are environmentally persistent and can be present at detectable concentrations in wildlife, it is clear that PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (including PFO) are not bioaccumulative according to regulatory criteria. © 2008 American Chemical Society.","Bioaccumulation; Biomagnetism; Structure (composition); Lipophilic compounds; Perfluorinated acids; Esters; carbon; carboxylic acid derivative; organic compound; organic matter; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; sulfonic acid derivative; Bioaccumulation; Biomagnetism; Esters; Structure (composition); bioaccumulation; comparative study; environmental legislation; fluorocarbon; food web; organic sulfur compound; partitioning; persistence; wild population; aquatic species; bioaccumulation; chemical structure; fluorination; food web; organic pollution; review; trophic cascade; wildlife; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Fluorocarbons"

To effectively and quickly defend against potentially toxic agents without launching harmful immune responses, the liver relies on its strong innate immune system. This comprises enrichment of innate immune cells (such as macrophages, natural killer, natural killer T, and γδ T cells) and removal of waste molecules and immunologic elimination of microorganisms by liver endothelial cells and Kupffer cells. In addition, the liver also plays an important role in controlling systemic innate immunity through the biosynthesis of numerous soluble pathogen-recognition receptors and complement components. Conclusion: The liver is an organ with predominant innate immunity, playing an important role not only in host defenses against invading microorganisms and tumor transformation but also in liver injury and repair. Recent evidence suggests that innate immunity is also involved in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, providing novel therapeutic targets to treat such a liver disorder.

In PNDM, insulin secretory failure occurs in the late fetal or early postnatal period.

The hemoglobin-based substitutes which was widely researched in the world includes human hemoglobin-based, animal hemoglobin-based and gene recombined hemoglobin based substitutes. The function and immunology of WBC is very complicated, so it is rarely used in clinic.

The treatment possibilities search for methods to restore and bring back the function of injured joint surfaces. Recent trend heads for creation of biocompatible matrices (scaffolds) based on natural and synthetic polimers. This study presents currently used biomaterials in the sphere of their usefulness in articular cartilage lesions repair. Both natural and synthetic materials have been researched in experimental and clinical studies. Naturally- derived protein polymers, such as collagen, fibrin, gelatin and carbohydrate polymers containing polylactide and polyglycolic acid, hialuronan, agarose, alginate, chitosan can be distinguished. Synthetic materials are represented by carbon fibers, Dacron and Teflon matrices. Scaffolds fabrication techniques include fiber-bonding, particulate leaching, freeze- drying and particles aggregation. Due to different polymers' properties selection of a scaffold depends on an appropriate matrix parameters. The most valuable characteristics are biocompatibility, porosity, mechanical resistance and bioabsorbability. Notwithstanding, several experimental and clinical studies there still exists the need for one simple and inexpensive polymer- based method that would bring satisfactory results in the area of joint cartilage repair.","biomaterial; polymer; articular cartilage; bone prosthesis; ceramics; classification; culture technique; growth, development and aging; human; methodology; physiology; regeneration; review; tissue engineering; Bone Substitutes; Cartilage, Articular; Cell Culture Techniques; Ceramics; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Humans; Polymers; Regeneration; Tissue Engineering"

Specifically, PFC-based treatment modalities have been shown to reduce levels of cytokines, chemokines and other mediators of pulmonary inflammation in a PFC- and, to some extent, concentration-dependent manner. As a result, neutrophil adhesion, accumulation and activation are reduced in PFC-treated animals and in humans undergoing partial liquid ventilation.

Indeed, muscle performance declines during prolonged and intense activity as a consequence of the shift from the aerobic to the anaerobic metabolism with an increase of lactate. To enhance the aerobic capacity 2 alternatives may be used: increasing either the transport or the delivery of oxygen. In this setting, blood doping is the practice of illicitly using a drug or blood product to improve athletic performance. Based on this definition, blood doping techniques may include: 1) blood transfusion (autologous or omologous); 2) erythropoiesis-stimulating substances [recombinant human erythropoietin (α, β, ω), darbepoietin-α, continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator, hematide]; 3) blood substitutes (hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers, perfluorocarbon emulsions); 4) allosteric modulators of hemoglobin (RSR-13 and RSR-4); 5) gene doping (human erythropoietin gene transfection); 6) gene regulation (hypoxia-inducible transcription factors pathway).

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) based oximetry uses exogenously administered reporter molecules such as perfluorocarbons to quantitatively interrogate oxygen tension (pO2). This technique has been successfully used in vivo in the preclinical setting and shows promise for clinical applications. NMR pO2 reporter molecules display a linear dependence of the spin lattice relaxation rate on pO 2, which forms the basis of this technique. Physical principles of spin lattice relaxation of pO2 reporter molecules and the pO 2 dependence of relaxation rate are discussed in this review.

The causes are multifactorial and include acute blood loss, blood loss from diagnostic testing and blunted red blood cell production. Blood transfusions are frequently given to patients in intensive care units to treat low hemoglobin levels due to either acute blood loss or subacute anemia associated with critical illness. Although blood transfusion is a life-saving therapy, evidence suggests that it may be associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. A number of blood conservation strategies exist that may mitigate anemia in hospital patients and limit the need for transfusion. These strategies include the use of hemostatic agents, hemoglobin substitutes and blood salvage techniques, the reduction of blood loss associated with diagnostic testing, the use of erythropoietin and the use of restrictive blood transfusion triggers. Strategies to reduce blood loss associated with diagnostic testing and the use of hemostatic agents and erythropoietin result in higher hemoglobin levels, but they have not been shown to reduce the need for blood transfusions or to improve clinical outcomes. Lowering the hemoglobin threshold at which blood is transfused will reduce the need for transfusions and is not associated with increased morbidity or mortality among most critically ill patients without active cardiac disease. Further research is needed to determine the potential roles for other blood conservation strategies. © 2008 Canadian Medical Association or its licensors.","aminocaproic acid; aprotinin; blood substitute; desmopressin; fluorocarbon; hemoglobin; hemostatic agent; perfluorooctyl bromide; placebo; recombinant blood clotting factor 7a; recombinant erythropoietin; tranexamic acid; anemia; bleeding; bone marrow suppression; brain hemorrhage; clinical trial; critical illness; critically ill patient; diagnostic test; drug mechanism; erythrocyte transfusion; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; hemodilution; hemoglobin blood level; hemophilia A; hemostasis; human; intensive care unit; morbidity; mortality; perioperative complication; review; risk factor; surgical patient; treatment outcome; upper gastrointestinal bleeding; von Willebrand disease"

Recently, complement and complement receptors have been reported to play an important role in the regulation of innate as well as adaptive immune responses during infection. The regulation of host immune responses by complement involves modulation of dendritic cell activity in addition to direct effects on T-cell function. Intriguingly, many viruses encode homologs of complement regulatory molecules or proteins that interact with complement receptors on antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes. The evolution of viral mechanisms to alter complement function may augment pathogen persistence and limit immune-mediated tissue destruction. These observations suggest that complement may play an important role in both innate and adaptive immune responses to infection as well as virus-mediated modulation of host immunity. © 2007 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","CD18 antigen; CD4 antigen; CD59 antigen; CD8 antigen; CD86 antigen; chemokine receptor CCR5; chemokine receptor CCR7; complement; complement component C1q; complement component C3; complement component C3a; complement component C3b; complement component C3b receptor; complement component C3d; complement component C3d receptor; complement component C4b; complement component C5a; complement component C5a receptor; complement component C5b; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement receptor; decay accelerating factor; glycoprotein p 15095; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 12; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; membrane cofactor protein; unindexed drug; adaptive immunity; antigen presentation; antigen presenting cell; complement activation; dendritic cell; host; immunomodulation; immunoregulation; inflammation; innate immunity; nonhuman; review; T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; virus immunity; virus infection; virus particle; Antigen-Presenting Cells; Complement System Proteins; Cytokines; Dendritic Cells; Humans; Immunologic Factors; Receptors, Complement; T-Lymphocytes; Viruses"

Ingestion of foods containing high amounts of animal fat is the main route of human exposure to lipophilic chemicals, such as persistent organic pollutants, which tend to bioaccumulate in the lipid compartment. Bioaccumulation results in increased exposure of these chemicals for humans, but particularly to breastfeeding infants, who are at the top of the food chain. The extent to which food contributes to a person's overall exposure depends on individual dietary habits and the concentrations of chemical residues in the food. These, in turn, are affected by (1) application methods, (2) properties and amounts of the chemical, and (3) preparation, handling, and the properties of the food. Once the food is ingested by the lactating woman, the chemical's pharmacokinetics and the transport mechanisms producing the movement of solutes across mammary alveolar cells determine the passage of chemicals from the blood to the milk.

Bacterial tubulin (FtsZ), actin (MreB), and intermediate filament (IF) proteins are key elements in cell division, chromosome and plasmid segregation, and maintenance of proper cell shape, as well as in maintenance of cell polarity and assembly of intracellular organelle-like structures. Although similar tasks are performed by eukaryotic cytoskeletal elements, the individual functions of FtsZ, MreBs, and IFs are different from those performed by their eukaryotic orthologs, revealing a striking evolutional plasticity of cytoskeletal proteins. However, similar to the functions of their eukaryotic counterparts, the functions conferred by bacterial cytoskeletal proteins are driven by their ability to form dynamic filamentous structures. Therefore, the cytoskeleton was a prokaryotic invention, and additional bacteria-specific cytoskeletal elements, such as fibril and MinD-type ATPases, that confer various functions in cell morphology and during the cell cycle have been observed in prokaryotes. The investigation of these elements will give fundamental information for all types of cells and can reveal the molecular mode of action of cytoskeletal, filament-forming proteins.

The accumulating data identifies ghrelin as having important roles in growth hormone (GH) release, appetite, metabolism, energy balance, cardiovascular function, reproduction, and bone growth.

Approximately 10-20% of circulating ghrelin is acylated and this feature confers its GH releasing ability, mediated by the GH secretagogue receptor (GHSR). In contrast, the remaining 80-90% of circulating ghrelin is desacylated. Desacyl ghrelin was initially thought to be inactive, but recent in vivo and in vitro evidences have identified biological actions for this peptide, independent of GHSR. Whether C-ghrelin has bioactivity remains to be determined, but it is known that plasma concentrations of this peptide respond to endocrine and metabolic manipulations in the same fashion as ghrelin itself. A third putative proghrelin peptide, termed ""obestatin"" has been mooted, but confirmatory biochemical and functional evidences supporting the existence of this peptide have not been forthcoming, suggesting it to be a biochemical miscalculation. This chapter will address biochemical aspects of proghrelin peptides and point to potential avenues for future work. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The combination of living polymers and Rf-containing alkyl halide plays an inportant role for a quantitiative introduction of the Rf group. The resulting Rf-terminated poly (2-hydroxyethyl methactrylate) film showed hydrophobic property in spite of its essential hydrophilicity. It was also observed that the surface structure of such polymer films were reconstructed corresponding to the environmental changes. Moreover, successful synthesis of end-multi-functionalized polymers with a certain number of Rf groups were demonstrated by means of an iterative methodology for the multi functionalization reaction. The number of Rf groups introduced are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 16, and 32. From the analyses of these polymer films by XPS and contact angle measurements, it was found that the surface enrichment and segregation of Rf groups strongly depend on the chemical linkage between Rf group and main chain as well as the number of Rf groups.","Anionic polymerization; Contact angle; Dendrimers; Fluorine containing polymers; Hydrophilicity; Hydrophobicity; Iterative methods; Synthesis (chemical); X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Anionic living polymerization; End-functionalized polymer; Perfluoroalkyl groups; Plastic films; film; hydrophilic property; hydrophobic property; polymer; polymerization; synthesis"

Much attention has focused on understanding the toxicology of the two most widely known PFAAs, perfluorooctanoic acid, and perfluorooctane sulfate. More recently, research was extended to other PFAAs. There has been substantial progress in understanding additional aspects of the toxicology of these compounds, particularly related to the developmental toxicity, immunotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and the potential modes of action. This review provides an overview of the recent advances in the toxicology and mode of action for PFAAs, and of the monitoring data now available for the environment, wildlife, and humans.

The focus in this review is on the relationships between the structures of polymers and their light emission properties. The synthesis methods of the polymers are first concisely introduced. Then the polymers have been divided into two kinds according to the difference of chemical structure. The one is the polymers that the main conjugation chains are only comprised of fluorene units, whose chemical modification are based on the active C9 of fluorene moiety. The other is the polymers that the main chains are comprised of fluorene and other functional groups through copolymerization.",

Although overall mortality appears to be decreasing in recent years due to improvements in supportive care, there are presently no proven, effective pharmacological therapies to treat ARDS and prevent its associated complications. The most common cause of death in ARDS is not hypoxemia or pulmonary failure, but rather multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), suggesting that improving survival in patients with ARDS may be linked to decreasing the incidence or severity of MODS. The key to developing novel treatments depends, in part, on identifying and understanding the mechanisms by which ARDS leads to MODS, although the heterogeneity and complexity of this disorder certainly poses a challenge to investigators. Novel therapies in development for treatment of ALI/ARDS include exogenous surfactant, therapies aimed at modulating neutrophil activity, such as prostaglandin and complement inhibitors, and treatments targeting earlier resolution of ARDS, such as β-agonists and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor.

To mimic the capillary network, subpopulations of neonatal rat heart cells were cultured on a highly porous elastomer scaffold with a parallel array of channels perfused with culture medium. To mimic oxygen supply by haemoglobin, the culture medium was supplemented with a perfluorocarbon (PFC) emulsion. Constructs cultivated in the presence of PFC contained higher amounts of DNA and cardiac markers and had significantly better contractile properties than control constructs cultured without PFC. To induce synchronous contractions of cultured constructs, electrical signals mimicking those in native heart were applied. Over only 8 days of cultivation, electrical stimulation induced cell alignment and coupling, markedly increased the amplitude of synchronous construct contractions and resulted in a remarkable level of ultrastructural organization. The biomimetic approach is discussed in the overall context of cardiac tissue engineering, and the possibility to engineer functional human cardiac grafts based on human stem cells. © 2007 The Royal Society.","bioengineering; bioreactor; cardiovascular system; DNA; oxygen; Rattus"

As such, it is important in several biological recognition/communication events mediated by sialic acid recognising proteins that play integral roles in these phenomena. It is therefore necessary to develop synthetic routes to sialic acid and its derivatives and analogues. Many of these routes have led to compounds used as enzyme inhibitors for treatment of disease states and also as probes of biologically relevant binding events and of the mechanisms of enzyme action. Every position on the nine-carbon backbone of sialic acid has been derivatised for such purposes, being synthesised both chemoenzymatically and chemically from precursors ranging from non-carbohydrate sources to sialic acid itself.

Although humans may be exposed simultaneously to numerous hazards, little is known about the interaction of prenatal chemical exposures with other factors, such as maternal stress, itself a modifier of fetal development. Gestational stress has been hypothesized to enhance the developmental toxicity of chemicals. This review identified 36 animal studies investigating if maternal stress may enhance the effects of prenatal chemical exposure, and evaluated the presented hypothesis. Studies of a broad range of chemicals and developmental endpoints support the notion, that maternal stress is able to enhance the effects of developmental toxicants, although stress mitigated chemically induced effects in a few cases. Maternal stress most often enhanced chemical developmental toxicity at dose levels associated with severe maternal toxicity or where test agents were already above threshold for effect. Thus, LOAELchemical was generally similar to LOAELchemical + stress, although not necessarily for the same endpoint. It should be noted that the database contained a limited number of studies, and only a single high dose level was applied in most studies, rendering establishment of NOAELs for combined exposures impossible. Furthermore, for some compounds, the margin between human exposure levels and the LOAELchemical + stress seems small. Future studies are recommended to investigate compounds, for which maternal stress was already proven as an enhancer, at lower dose levels. Interactive response seems to depend on stressor severity and timing of chemical exposure relative to maternal stress which should be further scrutinized. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This paper reviews the currently applied techniques for sample pre-treatment, extraction and clean-up for the analysis of ionic and non-ionic PFASs in human and environmental matrices. Solid phase extraction (SPE) is the method of choice for liquid samples (e.g. water, blood, serum, plasma), and may be automated in an on-line set-up for (large volume) sample enrichment and sample clean-up. Prior to SPE, sample pre-treatment (filtration or centrifugation for water or protein precipitation for blood) may be required. Liquid-liquid extraction can also be used for liquid samples (and does not require above mentioned sample pretreatment). Solid-liquid extraction is the commonly applied method for solid matrices (biota, sludge, soil, sediment), but automation options are limited due to contamination from polytetrafluorethylene tubings and parts applied in extraction equipment. Air is generally preconcentrated on XAD-resins sandwiched between polyurethane foam plugs. Clean-up of crude extracts is essential for destruction and removal of lipids and other co-extractives that may interfere in the instrumental determination. SPE, (fluorous) silica column chromatography, dispersive graphitized carbon and destructive methods such as sulphuric acid or KOH treatment can be applied for clean-up of extracts. Care should be taken to avoid contamination (e.g. from sample bottles, filters, equipment) and losses of PFASs (e.g. adsorption, volatilization) during sampling, extraction and clean-up. Storage at -20 °C is generally appropriate for conservation of samples. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

FtsZ, a eukaryotic tubulin homolog is a key cell division protein in most prokaryotes. FtsZ, as well as tubulin, is capable of binding and hydrolyzing GTP. The division of a bacterial cell begins with the forming of a so-called divisome. The basis of such a divisome is a contractile ring (Z ring) which encircles the cell about midcell. The Z-ring consists of a bundle of laterally bound protofilaments formed in result of FtsZ polymerization. Z-ring is rigidly bounded to the cytosolic side of the inner membrane with the participation of FtsA, ZipA, FtsW and many other divisome cell division proteins. The ring directs the process of cytokinesis transmitting constriction power to the membrane. The primary structures of the prokaryotic FtsZ family members significantly differ from eukaryotic tubulins except for the sites of GTP binding. There is a high degree of structural homology between these proteins in the region. FtsZ is one of the most conserved proteins in prokaryotes. However, ftsZ genes have not been found in several species of microorganisms with completely sequenced genomes. They include two species of mycoplasmas (Ureaplasma parvum and Mycoplasma mobile), Prostecobacter dejongeii, 10 species of chlamydia and 5 species of archaea. Consequently, these organisms divide without FtsZ participation. The genomes of U. parvum and M. mobile have many open reading frames which encode proteins with unknown functions. A comparison of the primary structures of these hypothetical proteins did not identify any known cell division proteins. We hypothesize that the process of cell division in these organisms should involve proteins similar to FtsZ in function and homologous to FtsZ or other cell division proteins in structure. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2007.","Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chlamydia; Eukaryota; Mycoplasma; Mycoplasma mobile; Mycoplasmatales; Prokaryota; Ureaplasma; Ureaplasma parvum"

It is inactive when bound to guanosine diphosphate and active when bound to GTP. When mutated, the gene produces an abnormal protein resistant to GTP hydrolysis by GTPase, resulting in a constitutively active GTP-bound protein that stimulates a critical network of signal transduction pathways that lead to cellular proliferation, survival and differentiation. At least three downstream effector pathways have been described, including Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and RalGDS, but they are not completely understood. Ras pathways are also important downstream effectors of several receptor tyrosine kinases localized in the cell membrane, most notably the BCR-ABL fusion protein seen in patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. An important consideration in designing strategies to block Ras stimulatory effect is that Ras proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, but require post-translational modifications and attachment to anchor proteins or membrane binding sites in the cell membrane to be biologically active. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) are probably the best-studied class of Ras inhibitors in hematologic malignancies. They block the enzyme farnesyl-transferase (FTase), which is essential for post-translational modification. However, it has been observed that the Ras proteins also can be geranylgeranylated in the presence of FTIs, thus allowing membrane localization and activation, which limits their effectiveness. It is now hypothesized that their mechanism of action may be through FTase inhibition involving other signal transduction pathways. S-trans, trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid, which was first designed as a prenylated protein methyltransferase inhibitor, has shown in vitro activity against all activated Ras proteins by dislodging them from their membrane-anchoring sites.

Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers have many characteristics that would serve as a useful adjunct to red cells in clinical settings. Over time, these technologies have the potential to dramatically reshape the practice of transfusion medicine. Objective. - To review the characteristics and potential utility of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers and perfluorocarbon-based oxygen carriers. Several hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers are under study in phase III clinical trials. Novel uses for synthetic oxygen therapeutics are emphasized. Data Sources. - All published reports with the key words oxygen therapeutics, blood substitutes, and red cell substitutes from 1933 until March 2006 were searched through Medline. Significant findings were synthesized. Conclusions. - Recognition of the true impact of red cell substitutes is still several years away. The most compelling products, hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers, have potential use in trauma, providing immediate oxygen-carrying support in the face of alloantibodies or autoantibodies, and in other clinical situations in which long-term survival of red cells is not essential. In the interim, efforts should be focused on enhancing the current blood supply system while supporting ongoing and planned blood substitute research efforts, including trials assessing novel clinical indications for these products.","blood substitute; fluorocarbon; hemoglobin; polymerized hemoglobin; autoimmune hemolytic anemia; erythrocyte; human; injury; Jehovah's witness; oxygen delivery device; review; sickle cell anemia; toxicity; Animals; Blood Donors; Blood Substitutes; Erythrocyte Transfusion; Erythrocytes; Humans"

This review focuses on new information regarding the pathophysiology of dense deposit disease, its appearance histopathologically, its relationship to other diseases including macular degeneration and acquired partial lipodystrophy and potential new therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: The microscopic features of dense deposit disease have been separated into five patterns with only about 25% of patients showing membranoproliferative features. The subtle interplay between genetic changes in complement regulatory proteins and dysregulation of the alternative pathway of complement is now more evident. Haplotype mapping has shown at-risk phenotypes of complement factor H associated with the development of dense deposit disease. Treatment protocols are empiric and not very effective. New information on complement inhibitors and plasma exchange, however, has brought hope for new therapies in the near future. SUMMARY: Understanding of the pathology and the pathophysiology of dense deposit disease has advanced rapidly in the last decade. New efforts in genetic mapping along with the development of novel inhibitors of the complement system will lead to improved care for patients afflicted with this uncommon condition. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","adipsin; anticoagulant agent; antithrombocytic agent; complement component C1; complement component C3; complement component C3b; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement factor H; corticosteroid; cytotoxic agent; eculizumab; immunoglobulin; adipose tissue; autoimmunity; clinical feature; complement inhibition; complement system; dense deposit disease; disease association; gene mutation; haplotype; histopathology; human; immunofluorescence; innate immunity; lipodystrophy; lupus erythematosus nephritis; membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; nonhuman; pathophysiology; pediatrics; phenotype; plasmapheresis; priority journal; retina macula degeneration; review; swine; Animals; Complement Factor H; Complement Inactivating Agents; Complement Pathway, Alternative; Complement System Proteins; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Glomerular Basement Membrane; Glomerulonephritis, Membranoproliferative; Humans; Kidney Transplantation; Lipodystrophy; Macular Degeneration"

The hydrogen bonding interaction is weak. The arrangement based on this mechanism is attained rapidly, but is slowly replaced (if partially) by a bona fide chemical bond. The issue of the exact nature of this chemical bond has been left unanswered in most of the reports. Past works deemed to have explored and elucidated the identity of the bond in question are gathered, reviewed and deductively presented. The review, we believe, clearly shows that the bonding in question involves (1) dangling bonds shielded within the sputter-deposited carbon, (2) transfer of the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl unit of Z-dol to the dangling bond site, and (3) attachment of the remaining alkoxy system, Z-O-CF 2-CH 2-O•, to the carbon surface as a pendant ether unit. The Z-dol moiety thus attached is held by a bona fide chemical bond, and cannot be replaced by water molecules nor removed by solvent extraction. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.","Magnetic hard disks; Molecular dispositions; Perfluoropolyethers; Carbon; Dangling bonds; Disks (machine components); Hydrogen bonds; Polyethers; Bond strength (chemical); Bond strength (chemical); Carbon; Dangling bonds; Disks (machine components); Hydrogen bonds; Polyethers"

We have contributed to this multi-faceted, worldwide effort with the development of predictors for GPI lipid anchor sites, for N-terminal N-myristoylation sites, for farnesyl and geranylgeranyl anchor attachment as well as for the PTS1 peroxisomal signal. Although the substrate protein sequence signals for various PTMs or translocation systems vary dramatically, we found that their principal architecture is similar for all the cases studied. Typically, a small stretch of the amino acid residues is buried in the catalytic cleft of the protein-modifying enzyme (or the binding site of the transporter). This piece most intensely interacts with the enzyme and its sequence variability is most restricted. This stretch is surrounded by linker segments that connect the part bound by the enzyme with the rest of the substrate protein. These residues are, as a trend, small with a flexible backbone and polar. Due to the mechanistic requirements of binding to the enzyme, we suggest that most PTM sites are necessarily embedded into intrinsically disordered regions (except for cases of autocatalytic PTMs, PTMs executed in the unfolded state or non-enzymatic PTMs) and this issue requires consideration in structural studies of proteins with complex architecture.

Interactions between ozone depletion and global climate change will significantly alter atmospheric chemistry which, in turn, will cause changes in concentrations of natural and human-made gases and aerosols. Models predict that tropospheric ozone near the surface will increase globally by up to 10 to 30 ppbv (33 to 100% increase) during the period 2000 to 2100. With the increase in the amount of the stratospheric ozone, increased transport from the stratosphere to the troposphere will result in different responses in polluted and unpolluted areas. In contrast, global changes in tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH) are not predicted to be large, except where influenced by the presence of oxidizable organic matter, such as from large-scale forest fires. Recent measurements in a relatively clean location over 5 years showed that OH concentrations can be predicted by the intensity of solar ultraviolet radiation. If this relationship is confirmed by further observations, this approach could be used to simplify assessments of air quality. Analysis of surface-level ozone observations in Antarctica suggests that there has been a significant change in the chemistry of the boundary layer of the atmosphere in this region as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion. The oxidation potential of the Antarctic boundary layer is estimated to be greater now than before the development of the ozone hole. Recent modeling studies have suggested that iodine and iodine-containing substances from natural sources, such as the ocean, may increase stratospheric ozone depletion significantly in polar regions during spring. Given the uncertainty of the fate of iodine in the stratosphere, the results may also be relevant for stratospheric ozone depletion and measurements of the influence of these substances on ozone depletion should be considered in the future. In agreement with known usage and atmospheric loss processes, tropospheric concentrations of HFC-134a, the main human-made source of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), is increasing rapidly. As HFC-134a is a potent greenhouse gas, this increasing concentration has implications for climate change. However, the risks to humans and the environment from substances, such as TFA, produced by atmospheric degradation of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are considered minimal. Perfluoropolyethers, commonly used as industrial heat transfer fluids and proposed as chlorohydrofluorocarbon (CHFC) substitutes, show great stability to chemical degradation in the atmosphere. These substances have been suggested as substitutes for CHFCs but, as they are very persistent in the atmosphere, they may be important contributors to global warming.

As a member of this family, the salicylic acid derivative known in the literature as 2-hydroxy-5-octanoyl benzoic acid or β-lipohydroxy acid has also been proposed as an exfoliant and as a treatment of photoaged skin and acne. This article reviews the effects of the hydroxy acids and compares them to those of the salicylic acid derivative. We propose the name C8-lipohydroxy acid (C8-LHA) for this derivative to differentiate it from other related compounds. The lipophilic nature of C8-LHA and its relatively slow penetration in the skin afford it an exfoliating effect that is efficient at low concentrations. It appears to have antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anticomedogenic properties, which make it effective against acne. Its antifungal and exfoliating properties are also likely to prove useful in combating dandruff. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing.","2 hydroxyacid; ceramide; citric acid; glycolic acid; glycosaminoglycan; hydroxyacid; ketoconazole; lactic acid; piroctone ethanolamine; placebo; pyrrole derivative; retinoic acid; retinoid; salicylic acid; acne; antiinflammatory activity; antimicrobial activity; cell proliferation; clinical trial; dandruff; drug safety; erythema; human; photoaging; priority journal; pruritus; rejuvenation; review; skin biopsy; skin burning sensation; skin care; skin exfoliation; skin irritation; skin penetration; ultraviolet B radiation; unspecified side effect; Administration, Cutaneous; Facial Dermatoses; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hydroxy Acids; Male; Risk Assessment; Salicylic Acids; Sensitivity and Specificity; Skin Absorption; Skin Aging; Skin Diseases; Skin Irritancy Tests; Treatment Outcome"

In particular, they differ in molecular weight, which partly determines their duration of action, and in their ability to expand the plasma volume. Dextran, hydroxyethyl starch and hypertonic colloid solutions improve oxygen flux within the microcirculation. Despite their benefits, the use of dextran and high molecular weight starches is limited by their negative impact on coagulation. In addition, these macro-molecules may also induce acute renal failure in susceptible patients. Current research focuses on the development of artificial oxygen-carriers as plasma expanders.

Unlike their brethren, the SURs have no identified transport function; instead, evolution has matched these molecules with K+ selective pores, either K IR6.1/KCNJ8 or KIR6.2/KCNJ11, to assemble adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channels found in endocrine cells, neurons, and both smooth and striated muscle. Adenine nucleotides, the major regulators of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel activity, exert a dual action. Nucleotide binding to the pore reduces the activity or channel open probability, whereas Mg-nucleotide binding and/or hydrolysis in the nucleotide-binding domains of SUR antagonize this inhibitory action to stimulate channel openings. Mutations in either subunit can alter this balance and, in the case of the SUR1/KIR6.2 channels found in neurons and insulin-secreting pancreatic β cells, are the cause of monogenic forms of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and neonatal diabetes. Additionally, the subtle dysregulation of KATP channel activity by a KIR6.2 polymorphism has been suggested as a predisposing factor in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Because of their physicochemical properties, these substances may be industrially used as cleaning solvents in the electronic components, fire suppression agents in the fire protection, and heat transfer fluids in the heat exchangers.

Further, the updated data on their toxicological profiles and potential exposure hazards from their degradation products were also addressed in this paper. It is indicated that HFPEs still pose some significant hazards, especially global warming and photochemical potentials, to the atmosphere. Regarding the estimation of partition properties (i.e., vapor pressure, octanol-water partition coefficient and bioconcentration) of HFPEs, the predicted values of log Kow for several HFPEs were found to be below zero, suggesting that they should possess very low potential for bioaccumulation in the environment. © 2006.","Environmental impact; Global warming; Oligomers; Solvents; Environmental risks; Exposure hazard; Hydrofluoropolyethers (HFPE); Photochemical potential; Ethers; chlorofluorohydrocarbon; fluorocarbon; hydrofluoropolyether; octanol; polyether derivative; water; Environmental impact; Ethers; Global warming; Oligomers; Solvents; bioaccumulation; environmental risk; global warming; greenhouse gas; hydrofluorocarbon; risk assessment; toxicity; atmosphere; bioaccumulation; chemical structure; environmental exposure; environmental impact; fire protection; fluorination; greenhouse effect; heat exchange; ozone layer; partition coefficient; physical chemistry; pollution; review; risk assessment; statistical significance; vapor pressure; Environment; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Ethers; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Risk Assessment"

Current ad-hoc clinical protocols require signifcant clinical effort and produce highly variable results. Model-based methods can provide tight, patient specifc control, while addressing practical clinical diffculties and dynamic patient evolution. However, tight control remains elusive as there is not enough understanding of the relationship between control performance and clinical outcome. Methods: The general problem and performance criteria are defned. The clinical studies performed to date using both ad-hoc titration and model-based methods are reviewed. Studies reporting mortality outcome are analysed in terms of standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and a 95th percentile (±2σ) standard error (SE95%) to enable better comparison across cohorts. Results: Model-based control trials lower blood glucose into a 72-110 mg/dL band within 10 hours, have target accuracy over 90%, produce fewer hypoglycemic episodes, and require no additional clinical intervention. Plotting SMR versus SE95% shows potentially high correlation (r=0.84) between ICU mortality and tightness of control. Summary: Model-based methods provide tighter, more adaptable one method fts all solutions, using methods that enable patientspecifc modeling and control. Correlation between tightness of control and clinical outcome suggests that performance metrics, such as time in a relevant glycemic band, may provide better guidelines. Overall, compared to the current one size fts all sliding scale and ad-hoc regimens, patient-specifc pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic model-based, or one method fts all control, utilizing computational and emerging sensor technologies, offers improved treatment and better potential outcomes when treating hyperglycemia in the highly dynamic critically ill patient. © Diabetes Technology Society.",

Porous biorubber scaffolds with an array of parallel channels mimicking the capillary network were seeded with cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, and cultivated in medium supplemented with PFC.

OTA is nephrotoxic and is suspected of being the main etiological agent responsible for human Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) and associated urinary tract tumours. Striking similarities between OTA-induced porcine nephropathy in pigs and BEN in humans are observed. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified OTA as a possible human carcinogen (group 2B). Currently, the mode of carcinogenic action by OTA is unknown. OTA is genotoxic following oxidative metabolism. This activity is thought to play a central role in OTA-mediated carcinogenesis and may be divided into direct (covalent DNA adduction) and indirect (oxidative DNA damage) mechanisms of action. Evidence for a direct mode of genotoxicity has been derived from the sensitive 32P-postlabelling assay. OTA facilitates guanine-specific DNA adducts in vitro and in rat and pig kidney orally dosed, one adduct comigrates with a synthetic carbon (C)-bonded C8-dG OTA adduct standard. In this paper, our current understanding of OTA toxicity and carcinogenicity are reviewed. The available evidence suggests that OTA is a genotoxic carcinogen by induction of oxidative DNA lesions coupled with direct DNA adducts via quinone formation.

In particular, it is shown how the electronic properties may be controlled by synthetic design. Insoluble poly(para-phenylene) can be made by a variety of precursor routes. Attachment of solubilising side chains gives soluble polyphenylenes in which a high degree of torsion between adjacent benzene rings produced by steric interactions between the substituents strongly reduces their electronic interaction. The phenylene units can be made coplanar by bridging them with methine or other bridges to produce ladder-type polymers, which show excellent photophysical properties, but strong intermolecular interactions lead to problems in obtaining blue emission. Similar problems are seen for 'stepladder' polymers such as polyfluorenes with only partial bridging of the phenylene rings. These interactions may be controlled by introduction of bulky substituents. The electroluminescence efficiency of these materials can also be enhanced by use of charge-transporting substituents. Copolymerisation with lower-band-gap units enables tuning of the emission colour across the entire visible range. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",

Several membrane-associated division proteins are then recruited to this ring to form a complex, the divisome, which causes invagination of the cell envelope layers to form a division septum. The Z ring marks the future division site, and the timing of assembly and positioning of this structure are important in determining where and when division will take place in the cell. Z ring assembly is controlled by many factors including negative regulatory mechanisms such as Min and nucleoid occlusion that influence Z ring positioning and FtsZ accessory proteins that bind to FtsZ directly and modulate its polymerization behavior. The replication status of the cell also influences the positioning of the Z ring, which may allow the tight coordination between DNA replication and cell division required to produce two identical newborn cells. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The Stockholm Convention, a global agreement on POPs, came into force in 2004. There has been a major expansion of measurements and risk assessments of new chemical contaminants in the global environment, particularly brominated diphenyl ethers and perfluorinated alkyl acids. However, the list of chemicals measured represents only a small fraction of the approximately 30,000 chemicals widely used in commerce (>1 t/y). The vast majority of existing and new chemical substances in commerce are not monitored in environmental media. Assessment and screening of thousands of existing chemicals in commerce in the United States, Europe, and Canada have yielded lists of potentially persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals. Here we review recent screening and categorization studies of chemicals in commerce and address the question of whether there is now sufficient information to permit a broader array of chemicals to be determined in environmental matrices. For example, Environment Canada's recent categorization of the Domestic (existing) Substances list, using a wide array of quantitative structure activity relationships for PB&T characteristics, has identified about 5.5% of 11,317 substances as meeting P & B criteria. Using data from the Environment Canada categorization, we have listed, for discussion purposes, 30 chemicals with high predicted bioconcentration and low rate of biodegradation and 28 with long range atmospheric transport potential based on predicted atmospheric oxidation half-lives >2 days and log air-water partition coefficients ≥5 and ≤1. These chemicals are a diverse group including halogenated organics, cyclic siloxanes, and substituted aromatics. Some of these chemicals and their transformation products may be candidates for future environmental monitoring. However, to improve these predictions data on emissions from end use are needed to refine environmental fate predictions, and analytical methods may need to be developed. © 2006 American Chemical Society.","Environmental impact; Ethers; Risk assessment; Toxic materials; Alkyl acids; Environmental chemists; Global measurement; Environmental engineering; alkyl group; aromatic compound; bromine derivative; diphenyl ether; halogen; organic compound; perfluoro compound; siloxane; Environmental engineering; Environmental impact; Ethers; Risk assessment; Toxic materials; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; bioaccumulation; biodegradation; environmental fate; environmental monitoring; measurement method; organic pollutant; persistence; risk assessment; toxicity; atmospheric transport; bioaccumulation; biodegradation; Canada; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; Europe; half life time; organic pollution; oxidation; partition coefficient; quantitative analysis; review; risk assessment; screening; United States; Biodegradation, Environmental; Canada; Chemistry, Analytical; Commerce; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Organic Chemicals; Risk Assessment; Canada; Eurasia; Europe; North America; United States"

The A2B subtype is a low affinity receptor, which couples to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and also leads to a rise in intracellular calcium modulating important physiological processes. Adenosine exhibiting activity at this subtype is at concentrations greater than 10 μM. The A2B receptors show a ubiquitous distributions, the highest levels are present in ceeum, colon and bladder, followed by blood vessels, mast cells and lung. Through A2B receptors, adenosine also regulates the growth of smooth muscle cell populations in blood vessels, cell growth, intestinal function, inhibition of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α), vascular tone, and inflammatory processes such as diarrhea and asthma. Potent and selective adenosine agonists are the result of modifications of the parent ligand adenosine by substitution, namely at N6 or C2 position of the purine heterocycle or at the 5′ position of the ribose moiety. 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosina (NECA) is one of the most potent A2B adenosine receptor agonist,.

Using the Great Lakes Initiative, water concentrations of PFOS were calculated to protect aquatic plants and animals. The screening plant value (SPV) protective of aquatic algae and macrophytes was calculated as 2.3mg PFOS/L. The secondary chronic value protective of aquatic organisms was 1.2μg PFOS/L. The screening-value water concentrations less than or equal to 1.2μg PFOS/L would not pose a potential risk to aquatic organisms. Because the aquatic benchmark is based on the most sensitive species, this benchmark should also be protective of other aquatic organisms, including amphibians. The tissue-based TRV for fish was determined to be 87μg PFOS/kgww. For terrestrial plants, a screening benchmark was determined to be 1.3 mg PFOS/kg soil ww or 1.5 mg PFOS/kg soil dw, whereas for soil invertebrates such as earthworms the benchmark value was 39mg PFOS/kgdw soil or 33mg PFOS/kgww soil. For avian species, dietary, ADI, and egg yolk-based benchmarks were determined as 0.28 mg PFOS/kg diet, 0.021mg PFOS/kg bw/d, and 1.7μg PFOS/mL yolk, respectively. Benchmarks for serum and liver for the protection of avian species were 1.0μg PFOS/mL and 0.6μg PFOS/gww, respectively. However, no-effect levels in laboratory studies suggest actual population-level effects would not be expected to occur until a concentration of 6.0 mg PFOS/kg in the diet, 5.0μg PFOS/gww in the liver, or 9.0μg PFOS/mL in the serum was exceeded, thus indicating the conservative nature of the benchmarks. © Springer 2006.","alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctane sulfonic acid; animal; bird; chemistry; fish; human; plant; review; soil pollutant; water pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Birds; Fishes; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Plants; Soil Pollutants; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

To guarantee the reliability and comparability of analytical data an intricate system of quality-assurance measures has to be put into effect in a laboratory. Reference materials and, in particular, certified reference materials (CRMs) are essential for achieving traceability and comparability of measurement results between laboratories and over time. As in any other domain of analytical chemistry, techniques used to monitor the levels and fate of contaminants in the environment must be calibrated using appropriate calibration materials, and the methods must be properly validated using fit-for-purpose matrix-matched CRMs, to ensure confidence in the data produced. A sufficiently large number of matrix CRMs are available for analysis of most elements, and the group of chemicals known as persistent organic pollutants, in environmental compartments and biota. The wide variety of analyte/level/matrix/matrix property combinations available from several suppliers enables analysts to select CRMs which sufficiently match the properties of the samples they analyse routinely. Materials value-assigned for the so-called emerging pollutants are scarce at the moment, though an objective of current development programmes of CRM suppliers is to overcome this problem.","Environmental engineering; Impurities; Organic pollutants; Quality assurance; Quality control; Uncertainty analysis; Certified reference materials; Environmental chemistry; Traceability; Trace analysis; inorganic compound; organic compound; pollutant; review; standard; Environmental Pollutants; Inorganic Chemicals; Organic Chemicals; Reference Standards"

Perfluorochemicals are used in many industry and consumer products, such as polymers and surfactants, because they have unique and useful properties (they are stable, chemically inert and generally unreactive). However, these compounds have also been found to be toxic, persistent and bioaccumulative. In recent years various analytical methods have been developed for the analysis of FASs in environmental samples. Most of these methods are based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) or tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/ MS), since this is considered to be the technique of choice. This article reviews the various LC - (tandem)MS methods described so far for the analysis of FASs in water, sediment, sludge and biota samples. It discusses the main experimental conditions used for sample pretreatment and for analysis as well as the most relevant problems encountered and the limits of detection achieved.","Bioaccumulation; Environmental impact; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Organic pollutants; Sampling; Toxicity; Fluorinated alkyl substances; Perfluorochemicals; Sample pretreatment; Fluorine compounds; fluorine; water; alkylation; animal; chemistry; human; instrumentation; liquid chromatography; methodology; pollutant; review; tandem mass spectrometry; Alkylation; Animals; Chromatography, Liquid; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorine; Humans; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Water"

Actual highly efficient hybrid does have an average daily milk yield of 250 g or 60 g/kg of live weight during the 4-weeks lactation period. However, compared with cow and sow milk, rabbit's milk is much more concentrated in fat (12.9 g/100 g), protein (12.3 g/100 g) and energy (8.4 MJ/kg) which explains the extremely rapid growth of the young (weight x 6 after 3 weeks). Characteristic of rabbit milk is also the nearly absence of lactose (&lt;2 g/100 g). At peak lactation, protein output per kg metabolic weight (13.4 g/day/kg0.75) exceeds even those of Holstein milk cows. The non-nutritional factors having the largest impact on the milk yield are the number of suckling kits, the parity order (primiparous vs. multiparous) and the gestation overlapping degree (rapid decline after 17-20 days of gestation). However, also through the reduction of feed intake, heat stress has a detrimental impact especially when the night temperature remains above 25°C. Rabbit milk lipids are highly saturated (70.4% SFA) due to the high content of C8:0 - C12:0 (50% of total FA) and further characterised by nearly equal quantities of oleic and linoleic acid and an ω-6/ω-3 ratio around 4.

Comparatively little is known about individual stereoisomers of pollutants, which can have differential toxicological effects and can be tracers of biochemical weathering in the environment. Stereoisomers are resolved by gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE). Separation techniques in environmental analysis are typically coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), as these provide the sensitivity and selectivity needed. The enantiomer composition of phenoxyalkanoic and acetamide herbicides, organophosphorus and pyrethroid pesticides, chiral polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites, synthetic musks, hexabromocyclododecane, and pharmaceuticals in the environment show species-dependent enantioselectivity from biotransformation and other biologically mediated processes affecting enantiomers differentially.

Calendering is also a common problem, which associates blisters, and poor calender release. All raw elastomers and compounding ingredients are free of moisture and other volatiles in order to reduce blisters. Molding, porosity, shrinkage of cured parts, and backrinding also cause problems in a rubber factory.

The Mollicutes (Mycoplasma, Acholeplasma, Spiroplasma) evolved by regressive evolution to generate one of the simplest and minimal free-living and self-replicating forms of life. The spiroplasmas are the more advanced members in the class and are the closest to their clostridial ancestors. Spiroplasmas were discovered and identified as such only in 1972 and the finding of a unique and well-defined internal cytoskeleton, believed to be uncommon in bacteria, followed in 1973. Structural analysis suggests that the core of the spiroplasmal cytoskeleton is a flat, monolayered ribbon comprised of the 59-kDa fib gene product. The ribbon follows the shortest helical line of the polar cell from end to end. The structural building blocks of the cytoskeletal ribbon are fibrils assembling into a structure with ∼10-nm axial and lateral repeats. Differential length changes of the fibrils may generate a wide dynamic spectrum of helical and non-helical geometries allowing for directional motility in low Reynolds number environments.

We reviewed publication from 1992 to 2006 that quantitatively examines moisturizer effectiveness, as an update of our prior overview, Zhai and Maibach in 1998 (2). We intuitively (in a testimonial sense) believe that moisturizers are sometimes effective for preventing and treating irritant dermatitis. However, moisturizer may not be broadly effective (8, 12) and may be relatively specific against certain acids, bases, hydrophilics, and lipophilics.

Currently, patients suffering from diseased and injured organs are treated with transplanted organs or cells. This paper reviews recent advances that have occurred in regenerative medicine and describes application of new technologies to treat diseased or damaged organs and tissues. Recent findings: Although most current strategies for tissue engineering depend upon a sample of autologous cells from the diseased organ of the patient, biopsies from patients with extensive end-stage organ failure may not yield enough normal cells. In these situations, stem cells are envisioned as being an alternative source. Stem cells can be derived from discarded human embryos (human embryonic stem cells), from fetal tissue, or from adult sources (bone marrow, fat, skin). Therapeutic cloning offers a potentially limitless source of cells for tissue engineering applications.

Generally it is formed by the union of the ventral primary rami of the spinal nerves, C5-C8 and T1, the so-called 'roots' of the brachial plexus. The goal here is to examine the neural architecture of the brachial plexus. The most constant arrangement of nerve fibers will be delineated, and then the predominant variations in neural architecture will be defined, particularly the prefixed and postfixed plexus, as well as the microanatomy and anatomy of the major terminal branches of the plexus. Multiple tracts connect many parts of the nervous system, and multiple ascending and descending tracts connect the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and lower spinal centers with the brain. This reflects that the nervous system is able to extract different pieces of sensory information from its surroundings and encode them separately, and that it is able to control specific aspects of motor behavior using different sets of neurons. Examination of the major sensory or motor pathways reveals a highly and tightly organized nervous system. In particular, at each of many levels, we see fairly exact maps of the world within the brain. In an effort to understand the functional neuroanatomy of the brachial plexus, this paper will focus briefly on the nervous connections of the nerves of the upper extremity with the brain.

In humans, deficiencies of early components of the classical complement pathway are strongly associated with SLE.

This review summarizes the biological monitoring of PFCAs, PFSAs, and related PFSs in wildlife and humans, compares concentrations and contamination profiles among species and locations, evaluates the bioaccumulation/biomagnification in the environment, discusses possible sources, and identifies knowledge gaps. PFSs can reach elevated concentrations in humans and wildlife inhabiting industrialized areas of North America, Europe, and Asia (2-30 000 ng/mL or ng/g of wet weight (ww)). PFSs have also been detected in organisms from the Arctic and mid-ocean islands (≤3000 ng/g ww). In humans, PFSAs and PFCAs have been shown to vary among ethnic groups and PFCA/PFSA profiles differ from those in wildlife with high proportions of perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate. The pattern of contamination in wildlife varied among species and locations suggesting multiple emission sources. Food web analyses have shown that PFCAs and PFSAs can bioaccumulate and biomagnify in marine and freshwater ecosystems. Knowledge gaps with respect to the transport, accumulation, biodegradation, temporal/spatial trends and PFS precursors have been identified.

The structure-property relationship of SPI membranes is discussed in details with respect to the chemical structure of various sulfonated diamines and morphology of SPI membranes from the viewpoints of viscosity, mechanical strength and proton conductivity. Ion exchange capacity (IEC), basicity of sulfonated diamine, configuration (para-, meta-, or ortho-orientation) and chemical structure of polymer chain (linear or net-work) show great influence on the water stability and mechanical strength of SPI membrane. The SPIs with a branched/crosslinked structure and derived from highly basic sulfonated diamines display reasonably high water stability of more than 200-300 h in water at 130°C, suggesting high potential as PEMs operating at temperatures up to 100°C. The SPI membranes have fairly high proton conductivity at higher relative humidities and low methanol permeability. The water and methanol crossover through membrane under the fuel cell operation conditions is not controlled by electro-osmosis due to proton transport but by diffusion due to activity difference. This is quite different from the case of perfluorosulfonated membranes such as Nafion and results in the advantageous effects on fuel cell performance. SPI membranes displayed high PEFC performances comparable to those of Nafion 112. In addition, SPI membranes displayed higher performances in DMFC systems with higher methanol concentration (20-50 wt%). which is superior to Nafion and have high potential for DMFC applications at mediate temperatures (40-80°C).","Branching; Fuel Cell Performance; Hydrolysis Stability; Polymer Electrolyte Membrane; Proton Conductivity; Sulfonated Diamine; Sulfonated Polyimide; Water Stability; Electric conductivity; Fuel cells; Naphthalene; Polyimides; Protons; Polymeric membranes"

Some complications occur mainly at the first use of a dialyzer: a new cellophane or cuprophane membrane may activate the complement system, or a noxious agent may be introduced to the dialyzer during production or generated during storage. These agents may not be completely removed during the routine rinsing procedure. The reuse of dialyzers is associated with environmental contamination, allergic reactions, residual chemical infusion (rebound release), inadequate concentration of disinfectants, and pyrogen reactions. Bleach used during reprocessing causes a progressive increase in dialyzer permeability to larger molecules, including albumin. Reprocessing methods without the use of bleach are associated with progressive decreases in membrane permeability, particularly to larger molecules. Most comparative studies have not shown differences in mortality between centers reusing and those not reusing dialyzers, however, the largest cluster of dialysis-related deaths occurred with single-use dialyzers due to the presence of perfluorohydrocarbon introduced during the manufacturing process and not completely removed during preparation of the dialyzers before the dialysis procedure. The cost savings associated with reuse is substantial, especially with more expensive, high-flux synthetic membrane dialyzers. With reuse, some dialysis centers can afford to utilize more efficient dialyzers that are more expensive; consequently they provide a higher dose of dialysis and reduce mortality. Some studies have shown minimally higher morbidity with chemical reuse, depending on the method. Waste disposal is definitely decreased with the reuse of dialyzers, thus environmental impacts are lessened, particularly if reprocessing is done by heat disinfection. It is safe to predict that dialyzer reuse in dialysis centers will continue because it also saves money for the providers. Saving both time for the patient and money for the provider were the main motivations to design a new machine for daily home hemodialysis. The machine, developed in the 1990s, cleans and heat disinfects the dialyzer and lines in situ so they do not need to be changed for a month. In contrast, reuse of dialyzers in home hemodialysis patients treated with other hemodialysis machines is becoming less popular and is almost extinct.","biomaterial; cellophane; cellulose; cuprophane; disinfectant agent; drug derivative; ethylene oxide; hemodialysis fluid; anaphylaxis; artificial membrane; chemically induced disorder; complement activation; disinfection; drug effect; equipment; human; neutropenia; recycling; review; Anaphylaxis; Biocompatible Materials; Cellophane; Cellulose; Complement Activation; Disinfectants; Disinfection; Equipment Contamination; Equipment Reuse; Ethylene Oxide; Hemodialysis Solutions; Humans; Membranes, Artificial; Neutropenia"

After the introduction, the basic knowledge of molecular structures and properties of polyfluorene homopolymers is presented as a background for a better understanding of their great potential for opto-electronic applications. Immediately after this, three different opinions on the origin of low-energy emission band at 520-540nm in polyfluorene-based LEDs are addressed. Rod-coil block copolymers and alternative copolymers are focused on in the next section, which are a vivid embodiment of controlling supramolecular structures and tailoring molecular structures, respectively.

In addition to the primary pathogens Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei, several species have emerged as opportunistic pathogens in persons suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF) and immunocompromised individuals. All Burkholderia species investigated so far employ quorum-sensing (QS) systems that rely on N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signal molecules to express certain phenotypic traits in a population density-dependent manner. Whilst many Burkholderia strains only contain the CepI/CepR QS system, which relies on C8-HSL, some strains, in particular isolates of B. pseudomallei and B. mallei, harbour multiple LuxI/LuxR homologues and produce numerous AHL signal molecules. Evidence has accumulated over the past few years that the QS systems operating in Burkholderia are crucial for full virulence in various animal models. However, only few QS-regulated functions required for virulence in the different infection models have so far been identified. Given the essential role of QS in the expression of pathogenic traits in Burkholderia these regulatory systems represent attractive targets for the development of novel therapeutics. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

ChoK is important for the generation of two major membrane phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) and subsequently for the cell division. ChoK plays a vital role in cell signaling pathways and regulation of cell growth along with PCho involved in malignant transformation through ras oncogenes in different cancers such as breast, lung, colon, prostate, neuroblastoma, hepatic lymphomas, meningiomas and diverse murine tumours. The Ras effectors serine/threonine kinase (Raf-1), the Ral-GDP dissociation stimulator (Ral-GDS) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) are involved in the activation of ChoK during tumorigenesis. ChoK gene induction seems to be associated with certain cell stress or cell defense. Nowadays, RNAi appear to be one of the most promising routes in the cancer therapy. The anticancer potential of both stable expression of siRNAs and their high sequence specificity by RNAi mediated suppression of oncogenic ras in human pancreatic carcinoma, human melanomas and ovarian cancer has been observed. It has an important role in sequence specific post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism. Presently, the crystal structure of Caenorhabditis elegans choline kinase A-2 (ChoKA-2) is available, which may be useful for comparative modeling of human ChoK and further modeling studies.

Such imaging is made possible through laser-optical pumping, which can improve the magnetic resonance sensitivity of certain noble-gas isotopes having non-zero nuclear spin by several orders of magnitude. The two most important isotopes are the spin one-half nuclei 3He and 129Xe, because of their long intrinsic T1 relaxation times. We recall that the conventional thermal polarization Pth in an applied magnetic field B0 is given by Pth=μB0/kBT, where μ is the nuclear magnetic moment, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature in Kelvins. For fully relaxed protons in a conventional 1.5 T applied field for whole-body MRI, we have Pth=6×10-6, which suffices for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of protons in water. Gases delivered at pressures of ≈1 atm are over 2000 times less dense than protons in water with a corresponding decrease in MR sensitivity, but hyperpolarization yields an enhancement of 4 to 5 orders of magnitude (Phyp=10-50%), more than compensating for the density difference. Indeed, highly polarized 3He can remain sufficiently sensitive to MRI even if it constitutes only a fraction of the inhaled gas mixture. Once introduced in vivo to the lungs, depending on the breathing maneuver and the inhaled mixture, HP gases relax with a time T1=20-30 s, where the relaxation is dominated by interaction with paramagnetic oxygen. In the glass cell used for hyperpolarization, T1 values are much longer, ranging from 20 to 40 h. Because the function of the lung is gas exchange, it is hardly surprising that regionally specific information about inspired gas should be at least as relevant to the study of lung physiology and disease as images of the lung-tissue structure (e.g. hydrogen MRI or X-ray CT). Results from several research groups have indeed demonstrated the potential for HP-gas MRI to enhance our understanding of lung function, with further potential impact on disease treatment, surgical planning, and drug development. (Lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma affect tens of millions of people in the US alone [1]). Almost immediately from the time that the first animal- and then human-lung images were demonstrated [2-5], several groups have explored pulse-sequence techniques and contrast mechanisms that go well beyond static spin-density imaging and that make use of the unique physical properties of these gases to address physiologically relevant questions. This article deals largely with one such contrast mechanism: diffusion (i.e. Brownian motion) of gas in the lung. Rapid gas diffusion can cause problems ranging from limited image resolution to signal attenuation due to the presence of bulk susceptibility and/or imaging gradients. However, as with relaxation due to the presence of oxygen (see below), there is a flip side to the story that enables meaningful physiological information to be obtained. Indeed, an early conclusion in HP 3He MRI, based on the fact that diffusion does not limit signal intensity or resolution as much as might be expected, was that airway and alveolar boundaries restrict the diffusive motion of 3He in healthy lung [6,7]. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the gas can thus be a powerful indicator of local airway and alveolar architecture, which is itself often profoundly affected by lung disorders, such as COPD [8]. Most of the imaging discussed here involves HP 3He, as it has been most widely used to date in studies of lung ADC. However, we also consider in this regard other gases that may be used as MRI signal sources. Other noble-gas isotopes (principally 129Xe) can be hyperpolarized and have been used for lung imaging [9]. Although 129Xe has only 1/3 the magnetic moment of 3He and has generally been more technically challenging to polarize in large quantities, it provides unique contrast in that it is taken up by the blood from the lung and exhibits a wide chemical shift range when dissolved in a variety of tissues [10]. The excitement generated by HP-gas MRI has also contributed to a renewed interest in the use of inert fluorinated gases to image the lungs [11,12]; these gases have a number of features that somewhat mitigate the disadvantage of a small (thermally generated) nuclear polarization, and they are technically easier to handle and use, particularly for in vivo studies. Before turning exclusively to diffusion MRI, we will first briefly discuss how hyperpolarized gas is generated and imaged. We will also highlight (though by no means exhaustively), some of the developments in the last 10 years across the field of lung imaging with HP gases. More complete reviews of the field may be found in Refs. [13,14]. The subsequent sections on diffusion MRI are based largely on research done by the group at Washington University, where it has been a major effort for the past 8 years. We will start with how simple measurements of 3He ADC can be used to gauge the regional severity of tissue destruction due to emphysema. We then discuss a more detailed model of airway architecture that can be tested by investigating 3He diffusion anisotropy. The fact that gases diffuse so rapidly affords the opportunity to explore lung structure on many different length scales, and the next section discusses experiments to measure long-range 3He diffusion in the lung. Finally, we present some recent work involving 19F diffusion MRI. Hyperpolarization of 3He: 3He is a stable non-radioactive isotope of helium with nuclear spin 1/2 and a gyromagnetic ratio about 25% smaller than the proton; it has ≈1 ppm natural abundance but is available in pure form as the result of collection from tritium decay. The nucleus can be polarized to values approaching unity by transfer of angular momentum from circularly polarized laser light. There are two basic schemes for this transfer: metastability-exchange optical pumping (MEOP) [15,16] and spin-exchange optical pumping (SEOP) [17]. In both schemes, the 3He gas typically resides in a glass vessel (cell) through which the laser light is directed. In MEOP, a radio-frequency discharge is ignited in the cell to create a population of 3He atoms in the triplet-2S metastable electron state. Optical pumping with 1083 nm laser light, corresponding to transitions from the triplet-2S to certain triplet-2P states, leads to a large electron polarization in the metastable state, which is immediately transferred to the nucleus via hyperfine coupling. Rapid electron-exchange collisions then produce nuclear polarized 3He atoms in the ground state. In SEOP, an alkali metal (usually rubidium) serves as an intermediary in the angular momentum-transfer process. Laser light is absorbed by the Rb vapor at a wavelength of 795 nm, corresponding to the first principal dipole transition (5S1/2-5P1/2), causing the Rb valence electron to become highly polarized. A density of Rb vapor appropriate to the amount of available laser light is produced in the cell by heating it to 160-200 °C. The angular momentum is then transferred to the 3He nucleus via a hyperfine interaction (zero-quantum transition) that takes place during Rb-3He binary collisions. In both methods, the mechanism for polarization transfer is easily turned off (in MEOP by terminating the discharge and in SEOP by cooling down the cell and condensing the Rb vapor), leaving the angular momentum stored in the form of polarized 3He nuclei. The longitudinal relaxation time of the gas (usually dominated by collisions with the cell walls) can, with some attention given to how the cell is fabricated, be many 10 s of hours, allowing sufficient time for storage and transport of the hyperpolarized gas to an MRI scanner. We note that the SEOP method can also be used to hyperpolarize the other stable and abundant spin-1/2 noble-gas isotope, 129Xe. Generally speaking, MEOP has historically had the advantage of an intrinsically faster production rate and largest maximum 3He polarization, routinely producing quantities ∼1 STP-liter/hour at &gt;60% polarization [18]. However, the RF discharge requires that the gas be polarized at pressures ∼1 Torr and then compressed to atmospheric pressures without causing significant polarization loss [19]. In addition, the lasers used in MEOP have been somewhat more expensive and more difficult to maintain. Initial large-scale polarization systems have been large and expensive, but much more portable and inexpensive MEOP systems have been recently demonstrated [20]. By contrast, SEOP systems have the advantage of cheap powerful portable lasers and the ability to operate at helium pressures between 1 and 10 atm but a slower intrinsic production rate; a typical system requires many hours to produce 1 STP-liter of HP 3He [21]. SEOP is a photon-limited process, and the introduction in the 1990s of compact inexpensive diode-laser arrays, capable of several tens of watts at 795 nm, was a crucial technological advance that allowed the production of quantities of HP 3He sufficient for human-lung MRI. Recently, the simultaneous use of both rubidium and potassium metals in a SEOP cell has been shown to improve the HP 3He production rate by an order of magnitude [22]. ...","Biological organs; Carbon inorganic compounds; Diffusion in gases; Isotopes; Magnetic field effects; Magnetic resonance imaging; Optical pumping; Oxygen; Paramagnetic materials; Protons; Pulmonary diseases; Quantum theory; 3He; Boltzmann constants; Hyperpolarized; Laser pumping; Thermal polarization; Helium"

However, scientific and technical improvements are still needed to accommodate the increasing demands of fuel cell systems for specific applications. Higher performance, low cost, greater durability, better water management, and the ability to function at higher temperatures are some of the challenges that must be overcome before widespread commercial adoption of fuel cell technology occurs. Approaches and recent progress toward the development of polymer electrolyte membranes for fuel cells are reviewed. The newly developed/developing polymer membranes can be classified into four groups: modified PFSA membranes, alternative sulfonated polymers and their inorganic composite membranes, acid-base complex membranes, and ionic liquid-based gel-type proton conducting membranes. These polymer materials have a great variety of chemical structure and may be able to meet the targets for use in advanced fuel cell systems.",

A quantitative analysis of the disaggregating of filter cakes under shear into concentrated suspensions is proposed. Two rheological models were used: an Herschel-Bulkley model to relate the relative viscosity to the shear rate, a modified Krieger and Dougherty model to relate the relative viscosity to the solid concentration at given shear rate. The maximum packing fraction of particles in the cakes was estimated as well as the ratio between the aggregates and the particle size rf/rp. This ratio logically declines with the intensity of shear. It shows that an advanced cake disaggregating was obtained for low shear rates of 10 s-1. Two processes of filtration-compression were also compared: a filtration of deflocculated suspension (FDS) and an innovative precoat filtration of deflocculated suspension (PFDS). The results showed that PFDS improved the cake dryness and specific resistance as well as the flowability of the final concentrated suspension. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A major prerequisite for optimal image quality and a more confident diagnosis is the adequate luminal distension of the bowel, which is usually achieved by administering an intraluminal contrast agent through a nasojejunal catheter. Magnetic resonsance enteroclysis is a new technique that combines the advantages of volume challenge with state-of-the-art ultrafast pulse sequences, resulting in an excellent demonstration of the anatomy of the small bowel. Magnetic resonance enteroclysis compares favourably with conventional enteroclysis in detecting, localising and assessing the extent of involved small bowel segments. Luminal narrowing and extramural manifestations or complications of the disease can also be accurately assessed by the technique. Imaging features including the presence of deep ulcers, extensive wall thickening and mesenteric lymph nodes exhibiting marked gadolinium enhancement correlate strongly with disease activity. Although the clinical utility of magnetic resonsance enteroclysis in Crohn's disease has been widely recognised, its routine application is currently limited to academic centres. Its clinical indications may include follow-up studies of known disease, the classification of Crohn's disease subtypes, an estimation of disease activity and a determination of the extramucosal extent and spread of the disease process. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Most naturally occurring bile acids belong to the 5β-series, with hydroxyl groups in the A, B, and C ring of the steroid system. Hydroxyl groups are mostly found at the C3, C6, C7, C12 and C23 positions and are α- rather than β-oriented. In most bile acids, the A/B ring junction is cis (5β-series). However, the A ring can be usually present in the more stable (chair) or less stable (boat) conformation. Both B/C and C/D ring junction are trans. With respect to the angular C19-methyl group, the hydrogen atoms at C5 and C8 are cis-oriented whereas those at C9 and C14 are trans-oriented. The archetypal bile acid is 5β-cholanic acid (3) from which all other C27 bile acids can be derived. In addition to the bile acids with 24 carbons, some naturally occurring C27 bile acids have been identified including di-, tri- and tetra-hydroxy derivatives of coprostanic acid isolated from bile of several reptile species. The most dominant bile acids and their natural sources are given and a selection of naturally occurring bile acids with unusual structures which have been mostly isolated from the bile of reptiles and amphibians is described.","bile acid; carbon; chenodeoxycholic acid derivative; cholanic acid derivative; cholic acid; cholic acid derivative; deoxycholic acid; hydrogen; hydroxyl group; hyodeoxycholic acid; lithocholic acid; methyl group; ursodeoxycholic acid; hydrogenation; nonhuman; protein conformation; protein structure; protein synthesis; review"

The risk of pneumonia, and risk of death is significantly greater for patients with high injuries. In cases of cervical SCI, mortality reaches 20% and respiratory morbidity - 100%. Among the most common complications are atelectasis, pneumonia and pulmonary embolism. Paralysis of respiratory muscles leads to hypoventilation, sputum retention and atelectasis resulting in respiratory insufficiency. Since the SCI is frequently associated with craniocerebral trauma, unconscious and uncooperative patients cannot actively cooperate and are especially prone to pulmonary complications. High cervical SCI (C1-C3) is followed by complete paralysis of respiratory muscles and lifetime ventilator dependence. Diaphragmatic nerve stimulators may sometimes restore diaphragmatic function but the availability of this method is limited. In tetraplegic patients with diaphragm paralysis, respiratory movements are caused by contraction of the sternocleidomastoid and interscalene muscles which can raise the upper part of the chest wall only. Spastic paresis of the chest wall and abdominal muscles prevents retraction of the chest wall during inspiration. Medium cervical SCI (C3-C5) is followed by transient respiratory insufficiency; some patients being weaned from the ventilator after spinal cord oedema regression and restoration of respiratory muscle function. In cases of lower cervical SCI (C6-C8), diaphragmatic and inspiratory neck muscle function is preserved. Intercostal and abdominal muscles are paralyzed, making active expiration impossible. Respiratory complications after thoracic SCI are caused more by the associated chest trauma than by the paralysis of the respiratory muscles. Coughing is usually preserved in such cases. Other respiratory complications include aspiration, bronchial hyperactivity and cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. In some tetraplegic patients, sleep apnoea may occur. The majority of patients with SCI require intubation. In patients with CSCI above C5 and complete quadriplegia, intubation should be offered routinely and early because delays may cause preventable morbidity. © PTAiIT, Borgis.","heparin; low molecular weight heparin; abdominal wall musculature; artificial ventilation; aspiration; atelectasis; breathing muscle; bronchus hyperreactivity; cervical spinal cord injury; coughing; diaphragm paralysis; disease association; frequency analysis; head injury; human; hypoventilation; lifespan; lung edema; lung embolism; morbidity; mortality; muscle function; nerve stimulation; pathophysiology; phrenic nerve; pneumonia; protective clothing; quadriplegia; respiratory failure; review; sleep apnea syndrome; spastic paresis; spinal cord injury; spirometry; sputum; sternocleidomastoid muscle; thorax wall; unconsciousness; weaning"

In the last 10 years, emphasis was to find the non fluorinated alternative membranes for use in PEM fuel cell with high proton conductivity, thermohydrolytic and chemical stability in aggressive fuel cell environment. The intention of this review is to provide an overview of progress made in the development of proton-conducting cation exchange membranes for use in PEMFC and DMFC and to describe the various approaches made to polymer synthesis and salient properties of the materials formed. The science and technology of proton conductivity in perfluorosulfonic acid membranes is discussed in detail.

Farnesyltransferase (FTase) and geranylgeranyl transferase I (GGTase I) are the prenyltransferases that catalyze the irreversible attachment of C15 farnesyl (Ras, Rnd) or C20 (R-Ras, Ral, Rap, Rho, Rac, Cdc42) isoprenoid lipid moieties to these small GTPases and other proteins. Therefore, pharmacological inhibitors of FTase (FTIs) and GGTase I (GGTIs) have been developed to prevent these modifications and thereby to block the lipid-mediated association of Ras and Rho proteins with cellular membranes and the consequent signaling and transforming activities. In addition, other small molecule inhibitors such as farnesyl thiosalicylic acid (FTS) can compete with the isoprenoid moiety of small GTPases for membrane binding sites. Finally, endogenous regulatory proteins such as RhoGDIs can bind to and mask the prenyl groups of small GTPases, leading to their sequestration from membranes.

The global historical industry-wide emissions of total PFCAs from direct (manufacture, use, consumer products) and indirect (PFCA impurities and/or precursors) sources were estimated to be 3200-7300 tonnes. It was estimated that the majority (∼80%) of PFCAs have been released to the environment from fluoropolymer manufacture and use. Although indirect sources were estimated to be much less important than direct sources, there were larger uncertainties associated with the calculations for indirect sources. The physical-chemical properties of PFO (negligible vapor pressure, high solubility in water, and moderate sorption to solids) suggested that PFO would accumulate in surface waters. Estimated mass inventories of PFO in various environmental compartments confirmed that surface waters, especially oceans, contain the majority of PFO. The only environmental sinks for PFO were identified to be sediment burial and transport to the deep oceans, implying a long environmental residence time. Transport pathways for PFCAs in the environment were reviewed, and it was concluded that, in addition to atmospheric transport/degradation of precursors, atmospheric and ocean water transport of the PFCAs themselves could significantly contribute to their long-range transport. It was estimated that 2-12 tonnes/ year of PFO are transported to the Artic by oceanic transport, which is greater than the amount estimated to result from atmospheric transport/degradation of precursors. © 2006 American Chemical Society.","Environmental engineering; Fluorine compounds; Industrial emissions; Oceanography; Solubility; Surface waters; Vapor pressure; Fluoropolymer; Oceanic transport; Transport pathways; Carboxylation; carboxylic acid derivative; fluorocarbon; perfluorocarboxylic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; sea water; surface water; unclassified drug; chemical pollutant; environmental fate; industrial emission; pollutant source; pollutant transport; adsorption; chemical industry; consumer; degradation; environmental impact; environmental residence time; field emission; geographic distribution; mean residence time; ocean environment; physical chemistry; pollution transport; precursor; review; sediment; solubility; source sink relationship; vapor pressure; water transport; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biological Transport; Carboxylic Acids; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Supply"

Metallocene complexes of group-III metals (scandocenes, yttrocenes, lanthanocenes), lanthanoids (neodymocenes) and group-IV metals (titanocenes, zirconocenes, hafnocenes) have been utilized in the selective (co-/hydro-)oligomerization of ethene, of the α-olefins propene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, and 1-octene, of branched olefins, e.g. methyl-butenes, methyl-pentenes and styrene, of cycloolefins, e.g. cyclopentene and norbornene and of α, ω-dienes, e.g. 1,5-hexadiene and 1,7-octadiene. Group-III metallocenes are often active in the C-C coupling without a cocatalyst; group-IV metallocenes require the help of a cocatalyst, such as methylalumoxane, MAO, aluminum alkyls, e.g. AliBu 3, or perfluorated boranes, e.g. B(C6F5) 3. The actinoid metallocenes (C5M5) 2AnMe2 with An = thorium, uranium allow for the dimerization and oligomerization of terminal acetylenes. The dehydrooligomerization of (hydro)silanes is typically achieved by group-IV metallocene chlorides together with n-butyl lithium. Also included in this review are related sandwich and half-sandwich (mono-cyclopentadienyl) complexes used for olefin oligomerization. The related sandwich complexes feature phospholyl, boratabenzene or carboranate ligands. Methods of oligo-olefin analyses by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), 1H NMR spectroscopy, gas chromatography (GC) or viscosity measurements for molecular weight determinations and by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for end group structure determinations are summarized. Possible applications of olefin oligomers, in particular oligopropenes are presented. The functionality of a double bond at the end of each chain (for further modifications) together with the product homogeneity are the advantages of oligomers from metallocene catalysis. In addition, olefin oligomerization is used to study mechanistic aspects and to obtain a better insight into the reaction mechanism of metallocene polymerization catalysis because of the homogeneity of the reaction mixture and because certain mechanistic aspects are easier to investigate in oligomeric products than in high-molar-mass polymers. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Results related to disordered carbon anodes and improved, solvent-free, as well as gel-type, polymer electrolytes are particularly stressed. It is shown that the use of proper gel electrolytes, in combination with suitable electrode couples, allows the development of new types of safe, reliable, and low-cost lithium ion batteries which appear to be very promising power sources for hybrid vehicles. Some of the technologies proven to be successful in the lithium battery area are readapted for use in fuel cells. In particular, this approach has been followed for the preparation of low-cost and stable protonic membranes to be proposed as an alternative to the expensive, perfluorosulfonic membranes presently used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). © 2005 The Japan Chemical Journal Forum and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","lithium; lithium derivative; chemistry; classification; electronics; power supply; review; Electric Power Supplies; Electronics; Lithium; Lithium Compounds"

Conceptually, polydentate Lewis acids are often regarded as the charge reverse analogs of polydentate Lewis bases and are thus expected to act as polydentate ligands for electron-rich substrates.4 This analogy was recognized almost four decades ago by Shriver and Biallas who showed that methoxide anions are effectively chelated by 1,2-bis(difluoroboryl)ethane (1), a charge reverse analog of ethylenediamine (Scheme 1).5 Following this seminal contribution, a great deal of effort has been devoted to the synthesis and study of such polydentate Lewis acids. An important part of the compounds that have been investigated consists of polyfunctional organostannanes1 and organomercurials.6-11 Despite the soft Lewis acidity of tin and mercury, these compounds exhibit remarkable properties and have been used as receptors for anions as well as for small electron-rich molecules. For example, while the 1,2-distannylbenzene 212 or the mercuraborand 313 readily complex chloride anions, trinuclear mercury derivatives such as trimeric perfluoro-ortho-phenylene 4 can be used as receptors for organic substrates including acetone (Scheme 2).14 Aiming at more powerful Lewis acids, a great deal of effort has been devoted to the preparation of polydentate Lewis acids that contain hard Lewis acidic elements of group 13.15,16 Despite their greater sensitivity toward hydrolysis and oxidation, several polydentate group 13 derivatives have been successfully synthesized and investigated. An important aspect of this research resides in the choice of the backbone that serves to hold the Lewis acidic site. In order to insure that the Lewis acidic sites remain available, it is important to choose a backbone that does not contain accessible Lewis basic sites such as oxygen or nitrogen atoms which could neutralize the Lewis acidic centers by intramolecular Lewis adduct formation or by through-bond π-electron donation. Moreover, as in the chemistry of polydentate Lewis bases, the structure of the backbone should serve to dictate the spatial orientation of the Lewis acidic centers as well as the overall rigidity or flexibility of the target polydentate Lewis acid. Since the occurrence of cooperative effects is entropically impaired with flexible systems, the preorganization of the Lewis acidic sites in a rigid molecular edifice is often preferred. Recent achievements in this area have centered on derivatives of ortho-substituted benzenes and peri-substituted naphthalenes. In this chapter, we will review the chemistry of bidentate Lewis acids containing two group 13 elements linked by an ortho-phenylene15,16 or a peri-naphthalenediyl backbone. This contribution follows an earlier review concerned with peri-naphthalenediyl group 13 derivatives.17. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

In normal cell division in Escherichia coli this is accomplished by the action of the Min proteins, which maintain a high concentration of a septation inhibitor near the ends of the cell, and a low concentration at midcell. This leaves the midcell site as the only available location for formation of the division septum. In other species, such as Bacillus subtilis, this general paradigm is maintained, although some of the proteins differ and the mechanisms used to localize the proteins vary. A second mechanism of negative regulation, the nucleoid-occlusion system, prevents septa forming over nucleoids. This system functions in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and is especially important in cells that lack the Min system or in cells in which nucleoid replication or segregation are defective.

The majority of inorganic contaminant studies focused on mercury and fish. While mercury concentrations were low in benthic feeding fish such as whitefish, predatory fish such as lake trout, pike, and walleye frequently had mercury levels which exceeded 0.2 μg/g, the consumption guideline for frequent consumers of fish, and 0.5 μg/g, the guideline for the commercial use of fish. Numerous consumption advisories were issued for lakes along the Mackenzie River. Relatively high mercury levels appear to be due to a combination of relatively old fish populations (because of light fishing pressures) and tend to be more prevalent in smaller lakes where warmer summer water temperatures and watershed influences result in greater mercury and methyl mercury inputs. Mercury levels were substantially lower in char than in lake trout, possibly due to a combination of a less fish-rich diet, a colder environment, and smaller MeHg watershed inputs. Less research has been conducted on other metals but some, such as rubidium, show pronounced variations in concentration that may be related to geological influences. Temporal trend monitoring has revealed little evidence of declining mercury levels in fish that can be attributed to declining atmospheric inputs. Because mercury follows complex pathways in the environment, other factors may operate to counteract reductions in atmospheric mercury sources, e.g., climatic variability, changes in the commercial fishery, and interactions between fish species. Most organochlorine (OC) investigations were based on long term trend monitoring and focused on char (Cornwallis Island), burbot (Great Slave Lake, Yukon lakes, Slave River at Fort Smith, Mackenzie River at Fort Good Hope) and lake trout (Yukon lakes, Great Slave Lake). There was strong evidence of declining OC concentrations in char, particularly ΣHCH and Σchlordane, which may reflect a response to declining atmospheric inputs. Endosulfan concentrations increased, as in the atmosphere. There also was evidence of declining OC concentrations in burbot in the Slave and Mackenzie rivers but not in Great Slave Lake and Yukon lakes. OC concentrations decreased in lake trout in Yukon lakes in the 2000s, most probably because of changes in the fish themselves (i.e., reduced lipid content, condition factor) and possibly climatic variability. Similarly, OCs declined in Great Slave Lake trout. New research on PDBEs and perfluorinated compounds determined that these contaminants are widespread in freshwater fish and concentrations may be increasing. Global warming is a major issue of concern for Arctic and Subarctic waters and may have adverse impacts on contaminant levels in fish and other biota. There is a need for contaminant studies in the north to be broadened to investigate climatic effects. In addition, monitoring studies should be broadened to consider factors affecting other aspects of fish biology. Foremost among these is integrating contaminant monitoring studies on lakes such as Lake Laberge and Great Slave Lake with stock assessment studies. Ecosystem based studies should be conducted on Great Slave Lake and Lake Laberge to more effectively understand contaminant trends and should consider inputs (atmospheric, river inflow, resupension), losses (sedimentation, volatilization), and biological pathways.

This paper summarizes results from that program from 1998 to 2003 with respect to terrestrial animals in the Canadian Arctic. The arctic terrestrial environment has few significant contaminant issues, particularly when compared with freshwater and marine environments. Both current and historical industrial activities in the north may have a continuing effect on biota in the immediate area, but effects tend to be localized. An investigation of arctic ground squirrels at a site in the Northwest Territories that had historically received applications of DDT concluded that DDT in arctic ground squirrels livers was the result of contamination and that this is an indication of the continuing effect of a local point source of DDT. Arsenic concentrations were higher in berries collected from areas around gold mines in the Northwest Territories than from control sites, suggesting that gold mining may significantly affect arsenic levels in berries in the Yellowknives Dene traditional territory. Although moose and caribou from the Canadian Arctic generally carry relatively low contaminant burdens, Yukon moose had high renal selenium concentrations, and moose and some woodland caribou from the same area had high renal cadmium levels, which may put some animals at risk of toxicological effects. Low hepatic copper levels in some caribou herds may indicate a shortage of copper for metabolic demands, particularly for females. Similarities in patterns of temporal fluctuations in renal element concentrations for moose and caribou suggest that environmental factors may be a major cause of fluctuations in renal concentrations of some elements. Concentrations of persistent organochlorines and metals in beaver and muskrat from the Northwest Territories, and carnivores from across the Canadian Arctic were very low and considered normal for terrestrial wildlife. Two new classes of persistent fluorinated contaminants, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) were found in arctic carnivores and were most abundant in arctic fox and least abundant in mink. Although trace element concentrations in king and common eider ducks were low and not of toxicological concern, the number of nematode parasites in common eiders was positively correlated with total and organic mercury concentrations. Future research should focus on cadmium in moose and caribou, mercury in caribou, and emerging contaminants, with an effort to sample moose and caribou annually where possible to explore the role of naturally occurring cycles in apparent temporal trends. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This recent body of work has led to a better understanding of the current levels and spatial and temporal trends of contaminants in biota, including the marine food species that northern peoples traditionally consume. Compared to other circumpolar countries, concentrations of many organochlorines (OCs) in Canadian Arctic marine biota are generally lower than in the European Arctic and eastern Greenland but are higher than in Alaska, whereas Hg concentrations are substantially higher in Canada than elsewhere. Spatial coverage of OCs in ringed seals, beluga and seabirds remains a strength of the Arctic contaminant data set for Canada. Concentrations of OCs in marine mammals and seabirds remain fairly consistent across the Canadian Arctic although subtle differences from west to east and south to north are found in the proportions of various chemicals. The most significant development since 1997 is improvement in the temporal trend data sets, thanks to the use of archived tissue samples from the 1970s and 1980s, long-term studies using archeological material, as well as the continuation of sampling. These data cover a range of species and chemicals and also include retrospective studies on new chemicals such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers. There is solid evidence in a few species (beluga, polar bear, blue mussels) that Hg at some locations has significantly increased from pre-industrial times to the present; however, the temporal trends of Hg over the past 20-30 years are inconsistent. Some animal populations exhibited significant increases in Hg whereas others did not. Therefore, it is currently not possible to determine if anthropogenic Hg is generally increasing in Canadian Arctic biota. It is also not yet possible to evaluate whether the recent Hg increases observed in some biota may be due solely to increased anthropogenic inputs or are in part the product of environmental change, e.g., climate warming. Concentrations of most ""legacy"" OCs (PCBs, DDT, etc.) significantly declined in Canadian Arctic biota from the 1970s to the late 1990s, and today are generally less than half the levels of the 1970s, particularly in seabirds and ringed seals. Chlorobenzenes and endosulfan were among the few OCs to show increases during this period while ∑HCH remained relatively constant in most species. A suite of new-use chemicals previously unreported in Arctic biota (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), perfluoro-octane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs)) has recently been found, but there is insufficient information to assess species differences, spatial patterns or food web dynamics for these compounds. Concentrations of these new chemicals are generally lower than legacy OCs, but there is concern because some are rapidly increasing in concentration (e.g., PBDEs), while others such as PFOS have unique toxicological properties, and some were not expected to be found in the Arctic because of their supposedly low potential for long-range transport. Continuing temporal monitoring of POPs and Hg in a variety of marine biota must be a priority. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The main metabolite of 3-NBA, 3-aminobenzanthrone (3-ABA), was found in the urine of salt mine workers occupationally exposed to diesel emissions, indicating that human exposure to 3-NBA due to diesel emissions can be significant and is detectable. There is clear evidence that 3-NBA is a genotoxic mutagen forming DNA adducts after metabolic activation through simple reduction of the nitro group. Several human enzymes have been shown to activate 3-NBA and its metabolites in vitro and in cells to form electrophilic arylnitrenium and rearranged carbenium ions, leading to the formation of purine adducts at the C8 and N2 position of guanine and at the C8 and N6 position of adenine. The predominant DNA adducts in vivo, 2-(2′-deoxyguanosin-N2-yl)-3- aminobenzanthrone and N-(2′-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-3-aminobenzanthrone are also the most persistent adducts in target tissue in rodents, and are most probably responsible for the induction of GC→TA transversion mutations observed in vivo. It is concluded that these adducts not only represent premutagenic lesions in DNA but are of primary importance for the initiation of the carcinogenic process and subsequent tumour formation in target tissue. Indeed, 3-NBA is carcinogenic in rats after intratracheal instillation, inducing mainly squamous cell carcinoma in lung. The intention of this article is to provide a critical review on the potential genotoxic effects of 3-NBA on human health. However, in general, there is a need for more mechanistic studies that relate 3-NBA to all processes that are considered to orchestrate tumour development and of studies on the ability of particles to promote 3-NBA genotoxicity. Because of its widespread environmental presence, 3-NBA may represent not only an occupational health hazard but also a hazard for larger sections of the general population. For an accurate risk assessment more epidemiological studies on 3-NBA-exposed individuals and a broader monitoring of environmental levels of 3-NBA are required. © The Author 2005.

The focus will be on the use of polypyrrole as a linker between a substrate and oligonucleotide probes. The modification step is based on the electrochemical copolymerization of pyrrole and oligonucleotides bearing a pyrrole group on its 5′ end. This strategy was employed for the immobilization of oligonucleotides on millimeter-sized electrodes, microelectrode arrays, as well as for the local structuring of homogeneous gold surfaces. Our approaches for the localized patterning of gold surfaces will be also discussed. Localized immobilization was achieved by using an electrospotting technique, where a micropipette served as an electrochemical cell where spot sizes with 800 μm diameters were fabricated. The use of a microcell using a Teflon covered metal needle with a cavity of 100 μm resulted in immobilized probe spots of 300 μm. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) was also used, and surface modifications of 100 μm were obtained depending on the experimental conditions. Different detection methods were employed for the reading of the hybridization event: fluorescence imaging, surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRI), photocurrent measurements, and voltamperometric measurements using intercalators.

Assembly of the C5b-9 complex initiates oligomerization of C9 and production of a transmembrane protein channel that inflicts damage to target cells. For protection, cells eliminate the MAC from their surface either by ectocytosis (direct emission of membrane vesicles) or by endocytosis (internalization). The process of ectosome release is rapid and involves cytosolic Ca2+ and activation of protein kinases, such as protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK). Recently, the involvement of mortalin (also known as GRP75 and mitochondrial hsp70) in MAC elimination has been suggested. Extracellular application of antibodies directed to mortalin increases cell sensitivity to MAC-mediated lysis. Release of membrane vesicles is ubiquitous and enhanced in apoptotic or tumor cells and upon cell activation. Composition of the ectosomes (also often referred to as microparticles) membrane proteins and lipids appears to be different from those of the original plasma membrane, indicating involvement of a selective sorting process during ectosome formation. Exosomes (unlike ectosomes) are membrane vesicles generated by endocytosis, endosome sorting into perinuclear multivesicular bodies (MVB) and exocytosis of MVBs. Exosomes appear to be different in size and composition from ectosomes. Exosome-associated MAC has also been described. Although research on ectosomes and exosomes is still limited, physiological roles in coagulation, vascular functions, angiogenesis, wound healing and development have been attributed to these shed membrane vesicles.

Toxoplasmosis is a major cause of mortality and contributor to the slow rate of population recovery for southern sea otters in California. An updated seroprevalence analysis showed that 52% of 305 freshly dead, beachcast sea otters and 38% of 257 live sea otters sampled along the California coast from 1998 to 2004 were infected with T. gondii. Areas with high T. gondii exposure were predominantly sandy bays near urban centres with freshwater runoff. Genotypic characterisation of 15 new T. gondii isolates obtained from otters in 2004 identified only X alleles at B1 and SAG1. A total of 38/50 or 72% of all otter isolates so far examined have been infected with a Type X strain. Type X isolates were also obtained from a Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and California sea lion (Zalophus californianus). Molecular analysis using the C8 RAPD marker showed that the X isolates were more genetically heterogeneous than archetypal Type I, II and III genotypes of T. gondii. The origin and transmission of the Type X T. gondii genotype are not yet clear. Sea otters do not prey on known intermediate hosts for T. gondii and vertical transmission appears to play a minor role in maintaining infection in the populations. Therefore, the most likely source of infection is by infectious, environmentally resistant oocysts that are shed in the feces of felids and transported via freshwater runoff into the marine ecosystem. As nearshore predators, otters serve as sentinels of protozoal pathogen flow into the marine environment since they share the same environment and consume some of the same foods as humans. Investigation into the processes promoting T. gondii infections in sea otters will provide a better understanding of terrestrial parasite flow and the emergence of disease at the interface between wildlife, domestic animals and humans. © 2005 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

This equivocation invites research designs that preemptively define a hypnotic group and a control group in terms of whether or not the word hypnosis is used in the protocol. These designs represent a backslide into naive operationism; they reveal little new about human nature or hypnosis. The field deserves an optimally heuristic definition that preserves pluralism and is relatively resistant to the teflon shield of preemptive definition.

Originally known as 'serum thymic factor' (FTS), thymulin binds to a carrier protein and zinc (Zn2+) to exert its biologic properties. Thymulin, albeit an essential hormone for the T lymphocyte differentiation and the normalization of the ratio of T-helper cells to suppressor cells, accumulating evidence suggests its involvement in inflammations of various etiologies. Recently, thymulin has been shown to have anti-nociceptive effects in hyperalgesia and in pain of neurogenic origin, ostensibly through action on sensory afferents and the release of anti-inflammatory mediators. Given its anti-inflammatory potential, thymulin downregulates the release of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, upregulates anti-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin (IL)-10, and exerts molecular control via the regulation of transcription factors and mediators. Recent evidence tends to indicate that thymulin can be a therapeutic agent in many inflammatory diseases and in pathological conditions affecting the peripheral and/or the central nervous system.

Activation of the complement system plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of SLE. For the past several decades, laboratory monitoring of SLE has focused primarily on measurement of serum C3, C4, and their activation products. However, the utility of these measures as biomarkers for diagnosis and assessment of disease activity of SLE is still debated. Over the same time span, knowledge of the complement system has advanced remarkably, with more than 30 proteins identified. In view of the urgent need for identifying reliable lupus biomarkers, it is appropriate to revisit the issue of whether the complement system is a potential source of biomarkers for SLE. This article will review historical aspects of complement measurement in SLE, and summarize recent advances that may lead to a newly rejuvenated ""gold rush"" to mine the complement system for biomarkers of SLE. Specifically, development and utility of a novel assay that measures cell-bound complement activation products as lupus biomarkers will be discussed. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Its role and efficacy depend on factors related to the stent, procedure, and patient. Goals: To review the evidence in the literature in which settings plastic or metal stents are cost-effective, and whether adjuvant measures or patient-related factors affect duration of stent patency. Study: Using databases a literature search was performed for papers published from 1979 to April 2004. All retrieved papers reporting experimental or clinical observations were rated according to strength of evidence, and carefully analyzed. Results and Conclusions: Metal stents (Wallstent) stay patent longer than plastic stents (large-bore polyethylene with side-holes), overall median 250 and 110 days, respectively, and seem cost-effective in patients with longer than about 6 months survival, which cannot be accurately predicted. Antibiotics or choleretic agents do not prolong stent patency in clinical settings.

PFC was first used in organ preservation as a component of the two-layer method (TLM). The TLM is comprised of University of Wisconsin solution [UW] and oxygenated PFC for pancreas preservation. Pancreata preserved in the TLM are oxygenated through the PFC and substrates are supplied by the UW. TLM has been shown to prolong the preservation period and repair pancreatic injury caused by warm ischemia. Currently the TLM was used for pancreas preservation prior to clinical whole organ transplant. In this first clinical trial, the morphologic quality of the human pancreas graft after reperfusion was excellent compared with the pancreas stored in UW. In addition, there was no acute rejection episode of pancreata preserved by the TLM. TLM preservation of human pancreata, without initial cold UW storage, prior to islet isolation, resulted in better isolation results and improved the success rate of islet transplantation. Thus preservation of human pancreata by the TLM has become an important process for successful islet transplantation. Nowadays, PFC is routinely used for pancreas preservation prior to islet isolation, which has had a significant impact on curing type 1 diabetes.

The analysis of the intrinsic effects of perfluorinated organic surfactants shows the group to have a characteristic overall picture: - high polarity - high thermal and chemical stability - ubiquitous distribution - non-biodegradability - multiple toxicity In addition, certain substances belonging to this group (e.g. PFOS) exhibit a very long retention time in the human body. Toxic properties vary and, like the mechanisms for global distribution, have not been fully clarified. In the meantime, individual members of this substance group have been (are being) removed from the market. This report shows that in future the planned EU chemicals law (REACH) can be used to prevent such substances being regulated after they have been distributed in the environment and thus after damage has already occurred. To this end, however, the requirements for registration for low tonnage substances (1-10 tonnes/a) must be supplemented with specific tests (in particular on biodegradability). Aim and Scope. The aim of the work was to analyse the intrinsic properties and risks of a subgroup of fluorinated organic substances. Results. A summarising article describes the toxic effects and properties of a group of substances selected from the approximately 30,000 existing substances. With regard to the ongoing debate on revising the European regulations of existing substances (REACH), it is apparent that standardised test requirements cannot be applied to impact and risk analyses which are at times highly complex. For governments, REACH only provides the starting points for this process in the form of prescribed standard tests. If a substance (or a substance group) draws attention, more detailed tests must be carried out by the industry itself in the framework of responsible care and in the framework of the evaluation step of REACH. It is therefore important that the standard requirements of REACH are selected appropriately. In this respect, the study reveals some serious deficiencies in the Commission proposal. Conclusion. The standard information for low tonnage substances (1-10 tonnes/a) must be supplemented in particular with an obligatory test on biodegradability. The possibility provided by the REACH dossier to evaluate substances on the basis of group observations (SAR, QSAR e.g.) is to be welcomed.","octane; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; sulfonic acid derivative; surfactant; unclassified drug; biodegradability; chemistry; dangerous goods; ecotoxicity; environmental protection; European Union; European Union Commission; geographic distribution; government regulation; information; law; molecular stability; polarization; quantitative structure activity relation; Registration Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals; review; risk assessment; standardization; thermostability; toxicity testing; toxicokinetics"

Earlier mouse models emphasize the importance of autoreactive antibodies formed against ""self"" proteins that serve as a source for T cell-mediated immune response, stemming from cross-reactivity and resulting in B cell activity. However, more recent models suggest the need for both autoantibodies and the initiation of the inflammatory cascade via the alternative complement pathway, which is unbridled as the cartilage lacks the usual regulatory proteins of the complement system. Furthermore, deficiencies in specific complement proteins could lead to an escape from negative selection by these self-reactive B cells. Moreover, the classical complement pathway establishes chemotactic gradients by which inflammatory cells follow and accumulate in the synovial fluid where they engulf immune complexes and release proteolytic enzymes. In addition, the processing of circulating immune complexes either via Fc receptor or CR1 and opsonization by complement fragments plays a key role in determining the fate of immune status. In addition, complement proteins are a major determinant in the size and solubility of an immune complex, which also affects clearance. The evidence regarding intra-articular activation of the complement system in RA provides the possibility to pharmacologically manipulate various parts of the complement system for therapeutic purposes and potential therapeutic targets for the control of inflammation and the prevention of joint destruction. © 2005 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","C reactive protein; collagen type 2; complement component C1q; complement component C1r; complement component C1s; complement component C2; complement component C4; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement membrane attack complex; complement receptor; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; interleukin 1; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; mitogen activated protein kinase; STAT protein; tumor necrosis factor; acute phase response; antigen antibody complex; Arthus phenomenon; autoimmunity; cellular immunity; complement activation; complement system; cross reaction; cytokine production; effector cell; Epstein Barr virus; human; innate immunity; lymphocyte proliferation; molecular mechanics; nonhuman; pathophysiology; phagocytosis; priority journal; review; rheumatoid arthritis; T lymphocyte activation; Animals; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Complement System Proteins; Humans"

The available data are objectively classified based on the value of the therapy or intervention as determined by the study design from which the data are obtained. Conclusions: Heliox administration is most effective during conditions involving density-dependent increases in airway resistance, especially when used early in an acute disease process. Any beneficial effect of heliox should become evident in a relatively short period of time. The medical literature supports the use of heliox to relieve respiratory distress, decrease the work of breathing, and improve gas exchange. No adverse effects of heliox have been reported.

With the discovery of crescentin, a cell-shape-determining protein that resembles eukaryotic intermediate filament proteins, the third major cytoskeletal element has now been identified in bacteria as well.","actin; bacterial protein; cell protein; crescentin; cytoskeleton protein; FtsZ protein; MinC protein; MinD protein; MreB protein; protein DivVIA; protein EzrA; protein FtsA; protein MinE; protein noc; protein ParM; protein SetB; protein SulA; protein ZapA; protein ZipA; tubulin; unclassified drug; amino acid sequence; Bacillus subtilis; bacterial cell; cell division; cell membrane; cell shape; cell structure; cell survival; cytoskeleton; Escherichia coli; eukaryote; fluorescence microscopy; gene deletion; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein function; protein structure; review; sequence homology; structure analysis; Actins; Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Physiology; Cytoskeleton; DNA; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Guanosine Diphosphate; Microscopy, Electron; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Bacillus subtilis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Eukaryota; Sula"

Many of the common luminescent conjugated polymers, e.g. derivatives of poly(phenylenevinylene) and poly(fluorene), are predominantly hole transporters (i.e. p-dopable). This article gives a brief overview of organic electroluminescence and electrophosphorescence and provides a more detailed consideration of ways in which electron transport in these systems has been enhanced by the incorporation of electron-deficient (i.e. n-dopable) small molecules and polymers into the devices, either as blends or by covalent attachment of sub-units to the luminophore or as an additional electron-transporting, hole-blocking (ETHB) layer adjacent to the cathode. The chemical structures of these systems are presented and their roles are assessed. Most of these ETHB molecules are electron-deficient aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocycles, e.g. derivatives of 1,3,4-oxadiazole, pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, quinoline, etc. Non-aromatic thiophene-S,S-dioxide derivatives are also discussed.

The aim of this review is to summarize several studies in Japan and characterize the toxicities of these compounds. We also compared the levels of contamination with those reported from various countries to illustrate the unique situation of the toxicological issues within Japan. PFOA and PFOS concentrations in surface water in Japan are in the ranges of 0.1-67,000 ng/L and 0.1-526 ng/L, respectively. While the origin of PFOS in surface water remains unknown, PFOA present in surface water is very likely to have been released from a few industries. The levels of PFOA and PFOS in the atmosphere are 71.8-919 pg/m3 and 2.3-21.8 pg/m3, respectively. The concentrations of PFOA and PFOS in Japanese serum range from an undetectable level to 52.2 ng/ml and from 0.2 to 57.7 ng/ml, respectively. The levels of PFOA and PFOS present in the serum of the inhabitants of Kyoto are higher than those of other cities. One epidemiological study conducted by 3M revealed an increase in prostate cancer mortality [3.3-fold increase (95% CI, 1.02-10.6)] among workers exposed to PFOA. Another study conducted by 3M revealed an increase in bladder cancer mortality (SMR 12.77, 95% CI 2.63-37.35) among workers exposed to PFOS. PFOA and PFOS had a low order of toxicity in an acute toxicity study in rodents; however, they exhibited versatile toxicities in primates. Both chemicals are carcinogenic in rodents, causing reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity. Additionally, peroxisome proliferation and calcium channel modulation are demonstrated effects. There are large interspecies differences in toxicokinetics.","alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctane sulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; animal; cohort analysis; female; Japan; LD 50; male; review; water pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Cohort Studies; Female; Fluorocarbons; Japan; Lethal Dose 50; Male; Octanoic Acids; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

There have been no systematic reviews of CD treatment or prevention. Methods: Multiple databases were systematically searched. Using independent double review and published quality review criteria, articles were rated as good, fair, or poor. Treatment benefit data were tabulated and conclusions were based on the rated strength of published evidence. Results: In all, 49 studies met inclusion criteria. Barrier creams containing dimethicone or perfluoropolyethers, cotton liners, and softened fabrics prevent irritant CD. Lipid-rich moisturizers both prevent and treat irritant CD. Topical skin protectant and quaternium 18 bentonite (organoclay) prevent rhus dermatitis. Diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (chelator) cream prevents nickel, chrome, and copper dermatitis. Potent or moderately potent steroids effectively treat allergic CD. There were no macrolide immunomodulator trials that met inclusion criteria. This review did not include studies of children, animals, or non-English language publications. Conclusions: A limited number of interventions effectively prevent or treat irritant and allergic CD, but well-controlled, outcome-blinded studies, particularly in the area of allergic CD prevention are needed. © 2005 by the American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.","acetic acid derivative; azathioprine; betamethasone sodium phosphate; betamethasone valerate; bufexamac; chelating agent; chromium; clobetasol propionate; clobetasone butyrate; copper; cyclosporin; dermalex; desonide; dimeticone; doxepin; ether derivative; flumetasone pivalate; fluticasone; fluticasone propionate; hydrocortisone; immunomodulating agent; indometacin; lipid; macrolide; mometasone furoate; nickel; pentoxifylline; perfluoropolyether; steroid; tacrolimus; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; allergy; clinical trial; contact dermatitis; data base; human; humidifier; priority journal; review; systematic review"

During the past few years several new modalities of treatment like surfactant have been introduced. One of them, and probably the most fascinating, is of liquid ventilation. Partial liquid ventilation, on which much of the existing research has concentrated, requires partial filling of lungs with perfluorocarbons (PFC's) and ventilation with gas tidal volumes using a conventional mechanical ventilators. Various physico-chemical properties of PFC's make them the ideal media. It results in a dramatic improvement in lung compliance and oxygenation and decline in mean airway pressure and oxygen requirements. It shows further promise for lung lavaging procedures, pulmonary image enhancement, pulmonary administration of drugs and as a technique to increase functional residual capacity in lung hypoplasia syndromes. There are no long-term side effect reported.","fluorocarbon; oxygen; blood; human; liquid ventilation; lung compliance; methodology; neonatal respiratory distress syndrome; newborn; review; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Liquid Ventilation; Lung Compliance; Oxygen; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn"

Major advances in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have stimulated renewed interest in these osmotically fragile wall-less cells. Reliable procedures are available to isolate and culture protoplasts from a range of plants, including both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops. Several parameters, particularly the source tissue, culture medium, and environmental factors, influence the ability of protoplasts and protoplast-derived cells to express their totipotency and to develop into fertile plants. Importantly, novel approaches to maximise the efficiency of protoplast-to-plant systems include techniques already well established for animal and microbial cells, such as electrostimulation and exposure of protoplasts to surfactants and respiratory gas carriers, especially perfluorochemicals and hemoglobin. However, despite at least four decades of concerted effort and technology transfer between laboratories worldwide, many species still remain recalcitrant in culture. Nevertheless, isolated protoplasts are unique to a range of experimental procedures. In the context of plant genetic manipulation, somatic hybridisation by protoplast fusion enables nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes to be combined, fully or partially, at the interspecific and intergeneric levels to circumvent naturally occurring sexual incompatibility barriers. Uptake of isolated DNA into protoplasts provides the basis for transient and stable nuclear transformation, and also organelle transformation to generate transplastomic plants. Isolated protoplasts are also exploited in numerous miscellaneous studies involving membrane function, cell structure, synthesis of pharmaceutical products, and toxicological assessments.

The far infrared portion of the spectrum (10-600 cm - 1) is measured with a polarizing interferometer having thermopile detectors with a common 4-mrad field of view (FOV). The middle infrared portion is measured with a traditional Michelson interferometer having two focal planes (600-1100 cm- 1, 1100-1400 cm- 1). Each focal plane is composed of a 1× 10 array of HgCdTe detectors, each detector having a 0.3-mrad FOV. CIRS observations will provide three-dimensional maps of temperature, gas composition, and aerosols/condensates of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn with good vertical and horizontal resolution, from deep in their tropospheres to high in their mesospheres. CIRS's ability to observe atmospheres in the limb-viewing mode (in addition to nadir) offers the opportunity to provide accurate and highly resolved vertical profiles of these atmospheric variables. The ability to observe with high-spectral resolution should facilitate the identification of new constituents. CIRS will also map the thermal and compositional properties of the surfaces of Saturn's icy satellites. It will similarly map Saturn's rings, characterizing their dynamical and spatial structure and constraining theories of their formation and evolution. The combination of broad spectral range, programmable spectral resolution, the small detector fields of view, and an orbiting spacecraft platform will allow CIRS to observe the Saturnian system in the thermal infrared at a level of detail not previously achieved. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Atmospheric temperature; Heat radiation; Infrared radiation; Infrared spectroscopy; Interferometers; Light polarization; Optical resolving power; Orbits; Atmospheric compositions; Atmospheric dynamics; Cassini; Saturn; Saturn's moons; Saturn's rings; Titan; Planets; air temperature; astronomy; infrared spectroscopy; review; space flight"

As for oxygen carriers, there are several candidates such as perfluorochemicals, modified hemoglobins and liposome encapsulated hemoglobins and albuimin heme. Perfluorochemicals have limited oxygen carrying capacity and oxygen inhalation is mandatory when they are used. Modified hemoglobins such as intermolecular or intramolecular cross linked hemoglobins have side effect to cause hypertension by scavenging nitro oxide (NO) which is produced by endothelial cells, because the size of these hemoglobins are small enough to go to the adjacent place near endothelial surface. Hemoglobin vesicles (HbV) in which hemoglobins are encapsulated in liposome is most possible candidate for oxygen carrier. Usefulness and safety of the HbV is evidenced by animal shock model or exchange transfusion model and they are now being prepared for clinical trials as red blood substitutes or oxygen therapeutics. Albumin heme in which recombinant human serum albumin incorporating synthetic heme is thought an ideal resuscitation fluid as this material has colloid oncotic pressure. Short time storage and viral infection are serious concern in platelet transfusion therapy for bleeding thrombocytopenic patients. Adhesion of the platelet to the collagen surface and aggregation at the bleeding sites to plug holes in blood vessels, and to facilitate the function of the remaining platelets is a starting point in developing platelet substitutes and several platelet substitutes have been proposed on this theory.","albuminoid; blood substitute; fluorocarbon; heme; hemoglobin; liposome; animal; human; review; Albumins; Animals; Blood Substitutes; Fluorocarbons; Heme; Hemoglobins; Humans; Liposomes"

This article gives a state-of-the-art review of synthetic approaches that have been employed for the synthesis of these environmentally relevant fluorinated compounds. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid derivatives, in particular, pose a problem because only a few perfluorooctanesulfonic acid derivatives are available from commercial sources-a fact that limits the ability of researchers worldwide to further study these compounds. Because of the limited literature available, this article also describes synthetic approaches for shorter chain homologues or perfluoroether analogues that can potentially be applied for the synthesis of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid derivatives. The preparation of typical starting materials for the synthesis of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid derivatives such as the perfluoroalkanesulfonyl fluorides and chlorides will be discussed.

The activation of PPAR-α by peroxisome proliferators in rats and mice may produce oxidative stress, due to the induction of enzymes like fatty acyl coenzyme A (CoA) oxidase (AOX) and cytochrome P-450 4A1. The effect of peroxisome proliferators on the antioxidant defense system is reviewed, as is the effect on endpoints resulting from oxidative stress that may be important in carcinogenesis, such as lipid peroxidation, oxidative DNA damage, and transcription factor activation. Peroxisome proliferators clearly inhibit several enzymes in the antioxidant defense system, but studies examining effects on lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage are conflicting. There is a profound species difference in the induction of hepatocellular carcinomas by peroxisome proliferators, with rats and mice being sensitive, whereas species such as nonhuman primates and guinea pigs are not susceptible to the effects of peroxisome proliferators. The possible role of oxidative stress in these species differences is also reviewed. Overall, peroxisome proliferators produce changes in oxidative stress, but whether these changes are important in the carcinogenic process is not clear at this time.","1 mono (carboxymethylthio)tetradecane; acetylsalicylic acid; acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; antioxidant; bezafibrate; ciprofibrate; clofibrate; clofibric acid; cytochrome P450 4A1; dicamba; fenofibrate; fenoprop; fibric acid derivative; gemfibrozil; glutathione; methylclofenapate; nafenopin; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; phthalic acid dibutyl ester; pirinixic acid; pirinixil; prasterone; retinoid X receptor alpha; simfibrate; transcription factor; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; antioxidant activity; carcinogenesis; DNA damage; DNA responsive element; drug metabolism; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme induction; hepatomegaly; human; lipid peroxidation; liver cell carcinoma; nonhuman; oxidative stress; protein induction; review; species difference; Animals; Antioxidants; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; DNA Damage; Humans; Lipid Peroxidation; Liver Neoplasms; Oxidative Stress; Peroxisome Proliferators; Transcription Factors; Cavia; Primates"

Our aim was to identify clinical or radiological measures that could assist in predicting a favorable clinical outcome. Methods: Risk factors, clinicoradiological features, and functional outcomes were assessed in 40 patients with vertebrobasilar ischemic stroke whose basilar arteries were absent on MRA. The presence of potential feeding arteries to the posterior circulation was recorded from a review of the MRA data. To permit quantitative analysis of the images, a potential feeding artery score (PFAS; range: 0-8) was established. One point was assigned when a signal was seen from an intracranial vertebral artery, a posterior inferior cerebellar artery, a superior cerebellar artery, or a posterior cerebral artery. On MRI, the location of the infarction was classified as involving the proximal, middle, and distal territories of the intracranial posterior circulation. The infarctions were also categorized as single- or multi-sector infarctions, and according to whether more than one penetrating or branch artery was involved. Clinical outcomes were classified as favorable (modified Rankin Scale = 0-2) or poor (modified Rankin Scale = 3-6). Results: The clinical outcome was favorable in 30% (n = 12) of patients, and poor in 70% (n = 28). A transient ischemic attack preceded the stroke in 48% of patients, especially those with a favorable outcome (67%). Patients with a favorable outcome had a higher PFAS (p = 0.036) and an increased incidence of single-sector infarction (p = 0.049). Conclusions: Our study suggests that a higher PFAS, accompanied by a single-sector infarction, is a predictor of improved clinical outcome in patients with vertebrobasilar ischemic stroke in which the basilar artery was absent on MRA.

Much lower values of Σμ1D, covering the range from 0.009 to 0.125 cm2/(V s), are found for solution-synthesized conjugated polymers for which six different backbone structures have been investigated.

Larger mobilities are found for discotic materials, with maximum values close to 1 cm2/(V s) in both the crystalline solid and liquid crystalline phases.

However, the physical stability of the LE can substantially be improved with help of suitable emulsifiers that are capable of forming a mono- or multi-layer coating film around the dispersed liquid droplets in such a way to reduce interfacial tension or to increase droplet-droplet repulsion. Depending on the concentrations of these three components (oil-water-emulsifier) and the efficiency of the emulsification equipments used to reduce droplet size, the final LE may be in the form of oil-in-water (o/w), water-in-oil (w/o), micron, submicron and double or multiple emulsions (o/w/o and w/o/w). The o/w type LEs (LE) are colloidal drug carriers, which have various therapeutic applications. As an intravenous delivery system it incorporates lipophilic water non-soluble drugs, stabilize drugs that tend to undergo hydrolysis and reduce side effects of various potent drugs. When the LE is used as an ocular delivery systems they increase local bioavailability, sustain the pharmacological effect of drugs and decrease systemic side effects of the drugs. Thus, the rationale of using LE as an integral part of effective treatment is clear. Following administration of LE through these routes, the biofate of LE associated bioactive molecules are somehow related to the vehicles disposition kinetics inside blood or eyeball. However, the LE is not devoid from undergoing various bio-process while exerting their efficacious actions.

Numerous studies have provided evidence for an increase in this process in areas of pathology in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Because complement activation proteins have been demonstrated in vitro to exert both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects, the significance of this process in the development and progression of AD is unclear. Studies in animal models of AD, in which brain complement activation can be experimentally altered, should be of value for clarifying this issue. However, surprisingly little is known about complement activation in the transgenic animal models that are popular for studying this disorder. An optimal animal model for studying the significance of complement activation on Alzheimer's - related neuropathology should have complete complement activation associated with senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (if present), and dystrophic neurites. Other desirable features include both classical and alternative pathway activation, increased neuronal synthesis of native complement proteins, and evidence for an increase in complement activation prior to the development of extensive pathology.

This study retrospectively evaluated the outcome referable to pain and motor function in these patients. METHODS: All patients had the typical Gilliatt-Sumner hand, secondary to compression of C8, T1, and/or lower trunk. Nineteen patients underwent an anterior supraclavicular approach, and 15 patients underwent a posterior subscapular approach to the brachial plexus. Nerve action potential recordings showed plexus involvement close to the spine, at the level of the junction of the spinal nerves to the lower trunk. RESULTS: Pain, present in 22 patients, improved in 21. Mild motor deficit improved in 12 of 14 patients. Severe motor deficit improved partially in 14 of 20 patients. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of true neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome provides a clear operative indication. Surgical decompression needs to involve the medial portion of the plexus, and especially the spinal nerves. An anterior supraclavicular approach is preferred in most cases. If there is a large cervical rib or there has been a prior anterior operation, then a posterior subscapular approach is indicated.","adolescent; adult; aged; clinical article; controlled study; female; gilliatt sumner hand; human; male; motor dysfunction; nerve decompression; nerve paralysis; nerve plexus; nerve potential; pain; phrenic nerve; postoperative complication; priority journal; retrospective study; review; school child; spinal nerve; surgical approach; thorax outlet syndrome; treatment outcome; Action Potentials; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Female; Humans; Intraoperative Period; Life Change Events; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Conduction; Neurons; Retrospective Studies; Thoracic Outlet Syndrome; Time; Treatment Outcome"

Two ACAT isoforms, termed ACAT1 and ACAT2, have been described. ACAT1 is ubiquitously found, with high expression levels in macrophages, adrenals, sebaceous glands and foam cells from human atherosclerotic lesions. In contrast, ACAT2 expression is restricted to the intestine and the liver of mice and non-human primates. The reaction catalyzed by ACAT is essential for intestinal cholesterol absorption, synthesis and secretion of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins, and intracellular storage of cholesterol. Therefore, ACAT inhibitors would theoretically reduce plasma cholesterol levels by blocking cholesterol absorption from the diet and by reducing hepatic VLDL synthesis. Moreover, ACAT inhibition could limit the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in the cytoplasm of macrophages, thus reducing the formation of foam cells. In view of these attractive possibilities, a great deal of molecules with ACAT inhibitory properties have been synthesized in the last 20 years. However, only a few of them have reached clinical studies, mainly due to unexpected side effects. On the other hand, most of the compounds assayed in humans have not shown substantial hypolipidemic efficacy. The present article focuses on the current knowledge of the pharmacology of ACAT inhibitors, and, specifically, on the different pharmacological approaches used to evaluate these compounds as hypolipidemic and antiatherosclerotic agents. © 2004 Prous Science.

Transcatheter closure has replaced surgical closure for the treatment of most secundum atrial septal defects at the current time. A major reason for this is the lower morbidity of transcatheter closure procedures. Several closure devices have come into clinical use. The Amplatzer® septal occluder (AGA Medical Co.) currently has the largest reported experience and subsequently the best-established safety and efficacy features. Clinically challenging situations, such as larger atrial septal defects, atrial septal defects with deficient rims and multiple atrial septal defects, are increasingly being addressed using the transcatheter approach, with improved results. The incidence of most complications has significantly reduced over time, and serious side effects are relatively uncommon. In this review, the literature is summarized regarding the current role of transcatheter closure, the evolution of the different available devices for clinical use and the complications that occur with their use. A comparison is also made with surgical closure techniques. © Future Drugs Ltd.

The alkynyl derivatives trans-[Rh(CCR)(=C=CHR)(PiPr 3)2] are also accessible from [Rh(η3- CH2Ph)(PiPr3)2] and two equivalents of a terminal alkyne. The reaction of trans-[Rh(R)(=C=CHR′)(PiPr 3)2] and trans-[Rh(Ph)(=C=CMe2)(PiPr 3)2] with CO led to a migration of the alkynyl, aryl, methyl or vinyl group to the α-carbon atom of the vinylidene ligand and gave the η1-vinyl-, η1-butadienyl- and η1-enynylrhodiumcarbonyl complexes trans-[Rh{η1- C(R)=CHR′}(CO)(PiPr3)2] in good to excellent yields. The (Z) isomers are preferentially formed. Even in the absence of CO, the methyl and vinyl compounds trans-[Rh(R)(=C=CHR′)(PiPr3) 2] (R = CH3, CH=CH2) undergo an intramolecular C-C coupling reaction to give the η3-allyl and η3-butadienyl isomers [Rh(η3-1-CH 2CHCHR′)(PiPr3)2] and [Rh(η3-trans-CH2CHC=CHR′)(PiPr3) 2]. Acid-induced cleavage of the Rh-C σ-bond of trans-[Rh{η1-C(R)=CHR′}(CO)(PiPr3)2] with acetic acid affords trans-[Rh(κ1-O2CCH 3)(CO)(PiPr3)2] and the corresponding olefin or diene, respectively. In contrast, the enynyl complexes trans- [Rh{η1-C(CCR)=CHR′}(CO)(PiPr3)2] (R = R′ = Ph, tBu) react with CF3CO2H to give almost exclusively the butatrienes RCH=C=C=CHR′. Treatment of [Rh(η3-1-CH2CHCHR′)(PiPr3) 2] and [Rh(η3-trans-CH2CHC=CHR′) (PiPr3)2] with acid gives [Rh(κ2-O 2CCH3)(PiPr3)2] and the respective olefin or diene. With the chelate compound [Rh(κ2-O 2CCH3)(PiPr3)2] as the starting material, a stepwise trimerization of HCCCO2Me can be performed which, however, does not lead to a trisubstituted arene but selectively to a hexadienyne derivative. The C4-bridged vinylidenerhodium(I) complexes trans-[{Rh(=C=CHR)(PiPr3)2}2(μ-CC-CC)] react with CO and 2,6-dimethylphenylisocyanide by a twofold migratory insertion to give the dinuclear compounds trans-[{Rh(CX)(PiPr3) 2}2{μ-C(=CHR)CC-CC(=CHR)}], which contain a highly unsaturated eight-membered C8 chain as the bridge. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

FtsZ (the tubulin homolog) and MreB/ParM (the actin homologs) are indispensable for cellular tasks that require the cell to accurately position molecules, similar to the function of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. FtsZ is the organizing molecule of bacterial cell division and forms a filamentous ring around the middle of the cell. Many molecules, including MinCDE, Su1A, ZipA, and FtsA, assist with this process directly. Recently, genes much more similar to tubulin than to FtsZ have been identified in Verrucomicrobia. MreB forms helices underneath the inner membrane and probably defines the shape of the cell by positioning transmembrane and periplasmic cell wall-synthesizing enzymes. Currently, no interacting proteins are known for MreB and its relatives that help these proteins polymerize or depolymerize at certain times and places inside the cell. It is anticipated that MreB-interacting proteins exist in analogy to the large number of actin binding proteins in eukaryotes. ParM (a plasmid-borne actin homolog) is directly involved in pushing certain single-copy plasmids to the opposite poles by ParR/parC-assisted polymerization into double-helical filaments, much like the filaments formed by actin, F-actin. Mollicutes seem to have developed special systems for cell shape determination and motility, such as the fibril protein in Spiroplasma.","actin; bacterial protein; cytoskeleton protein; elongation factor Tu; FtsZ protein; MreB protein; protein FtsA; protein mincde; protein sula; protein ZipA; tubulin; unclassified drug; actin filament; Bacillus subtilis; bacterial cell; bacterial gene; cell division; cell membrane; cell motility; cell shape; cell wall; chloroplast; cytology; cytoskeleton; depolymerization; eukaryote; fiber; microfilament; mitochondrion; nonhuman; plasmid; priority journal; prokaryosis; protein analysis; protein binding; protein determination; protein function; protein interaction; protein polymerization; protein structure; proteomics; review; sequence homology; Spiroplasma; sporogenesis; Actins; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Cytoskeleton; Tubulin; Bacillus subtilis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Eukaryota; Mollicutes; Prokaryota; Spiroplasma; Sula; Verrucomicrobia"

These effects include increased β-oxidation of fatty acids, increases in several cytochrome P-450 (CYP450)-mediated reactions, and inhibition of the secretion of very low-density lipoproteins and cholesterol from the liver. These effects on lipid metabolism and transport result in a reduction of cholesterol and triglycerides in serum and an accumulation of lipids in the liver. The triad of tumors observed (liver, Leydig cell, and pancreatic acinar-cell) is typical of many PPAR agonists and is believed to involve nongenotoxic mechanisms. The hepatocellular tumors observed in rats are likely to have been the result of the activation of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα). The tumors observed in the testis (Leydig-cell) have been hypothesized to be associated with an increased level of serum estradiol in concert with testicular growth factors. The mechanism responsible for the acinarcell tumors of the pancreas in rats remains the subject of active investigation. The mechanism resulting in the hepatocellular tumors in rats (PPARα activation) is not likely to be relevant to humans. Similarly, the proposed mechanism for Leydig-cell tumor formation is of questionable relevance to humans. Acinar tumors of the pancreas are rare in humans, and the relevance of the these tumors, as found in rats, to humans is uncertain. Epidemiological investigations and medical surveillance of occupationally exposed workers have not found consistent associations between PFOA exposure and adverse health effects.","cytochrome P450; low density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; perfluorooctane; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; acinar cell carcinoma; breast tumor; carcinogenesis; concentration response; correlation analysis; drug absorption; drug clearance; drug distribution; drug effect; drug elimination; drug excretion; drug tissue level; estradiol blood level; eye irritation; fatty acid oxidation; genetic toxicology; hamster; health survey; human; Leydig cell tumor; lipid metabolism; liver cell carcinoma; medical research; monkey; nonhuman; occupational exposure; occupational health; rabbit; receptor affinity; reproductive toxicity; review; sex difference; skin irritation; skin sensitization; skin toxicity; statistical significance; toxicology; Animals; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Leydig Cell Tumor; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Mutagenicity Tests; Octanoic Acids; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Peroxisome Proliferators; Rats; Skin; Testicular Neoplasms; Tissue Distribution; Cricetinae; Oryctolagus cuniculus"

To date, three PPAR subtypes have been discovered and characterized (PPARα, β/δ, γ). Different PPAR subtypes have been shown to play crucial roles in important diseases and conditions such as obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, cancer, and fertility. Among the most studied roles of PPARs is their involvement in inflammatory processes. Numerous studies have revealed that agonists of PPARα and PPARγ exert anti-inflammatory effects both in vitro and in vivo. Using the carrageenan-induced paw edema model of inflammation, a recent study in our laboratories showed that these agonists hinder the initiation phase, but not the late phase of the inflammatory process. Furthermore, in the same experimental model, we recently also observed that activation of PPARδ exerted an anti-inflammatory effect. Despite the fact that exclusive dependence of these effects on PPARs has been questioned, the bulk of evidence suggests that all three PPAR subtypes, PPARα, δ, γ, play a significant role in controlling inflammatory responses. Whether these subtypes act via a common mechanism or are independent of each other remains to be elucidated. However, due to the intensity of research efforts in this area, it is anticipated that these efforts will result in the development of PPAR ligands as therapeutic agents for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.","15 deoxy delta12,14 prostaglandin J2; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; 3 chloro 4 [3 (7 propyl 3 trifluoromethylbenzisoxazol 6 yloxy)propylthio]phenylacetic acid; 4 [4 [3 (4 acetyl 3 hydroxy 2 propylphenoxy)propoxy]phenoxy]acetic acid; carrageenan; DNA; gw 7647; leukotriene B4; n (2 cyclohexyloxy 4 nitrophenyl)methanesulfonamide; nitric oxide; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; pirinixic acid; rosiglitazone; troglitazone; unclassified drug; aging; antiinflammatory activity; atherosclerosis; autoimmune disease; cancer; cell cycle; cytokine production; degenerative disease; diabetes mellitus; DNA binding; DNA binding motif; drug DNA binding; drug mechanism; drug specificity; fertility; human; inflammation; ligand binding; nonhuman; obesity; pathophysiology; paw edema; protein family; review"

To use the P(CF3)2- ion in nucleophilic substitution reactions, it is necessary to reduce the negative hyperconjugation, which is associated with a C-F activation. For this reason we synthesized different bis(trifluoromethyl)phosphanido complexes of mercury, silver and tungsten and investigated their use in nucleophilic substitution reactions. The most reactive compound, resulting from this study so far, is the pentacarbonylbis(trifluoromethyl)phosphanidotungstenate, [W{P(CF3)2}(CO)5]-, which exhibits nearly the same bonding situation for the P(CF3)2 unit as in the free P(CF3)2- ion. For use in synthesis of bis(trifluoromethyl)phosphane derivatives, Lewis acids are desirable, which stabilize the P(CF3)2- ion by an intermediary formation of a donor acceptor adduct and can be split off after the synthesis of bis(trifluoromethyl)phosphane derivatives, as could be achieved using the extremely weak Lewis acids, CS2 and acetone. These results could be established in the synthesis of the first example of an chiral, bidentate bis(trifluoromethyl)phosphane derivative. To synthesize a chiral, bidentate bis(pentafluorophenyl)phosphane derivative, a different synthetic strategy is necessary that does not involve the P(C6F5)2- ion, which decomposes even at low temperature. The implementation of functional P(CN)2- ions leads to the synthesis of functional, chiral bidentate dicyanophosphane derivatives which finally can be transformed into the corresponding bis(pentafluorophenyl)phosphane derivatives. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The reaction mechanisms for the different reaction conditions are discussed. Electron irradiation of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) with a very high dose leads to a complete degradation of the macromolecules to low-molecular products. In the presence of oxygen perfluorocarboxylic acids and in an inert atmosphere, mixtures of perfluorinated olefins and paraffins can be obtained. Virgin PTFE is disintegrated by high-energy irradiation in air with a lower dose into a micropowder modified with COOH groups. This powder can be homogeneously incorporated in other polymers. So, the special properties of PTFE can be made effective in these polymers. Micropowders functionalized with COOH groups and polyamides (PA) form by reactive extrusion PTFE-PA blockcopolymers which can be used as slide bearing materials. The copolymers poly(tetrafluoroethylene-co-hexafluoropropylene) (FEP) and poly(tetrafluoroethylene-co-perfluoropropyl vinyl ether) (PFA) irradiated in air show a significantly higher degree of COOH functionalization compared with PTFE. Irradiation of molten PTFE in an inert atmosphere leads to formation of different kinds of double bonds, CF3 side groups, long-chain branches as well as cross-links. Irradiation of PFA in vacuum results in the generation of COF and COOH groups; in molten state also branches and cross-links are formed.

This understanding is the essential prerequisite for a potential therapeutic approach, which may support specifically the insufficient antifungal attack of the host.

So far, internationally harmonized approaches are lacking that would allow comparison of results from inhalation studies with 'contrived' test aerosols taking into account the actual particle size of the product as it might be encountered in normal handling and use. The focus of this paper is to consider aerosols of irritant substances eliciting their mode of action on sites of initial deposition within the respiratory tract of rats. Assessment is based on conventional endpoints, such as mortality (LC50), and sublethal endpoints that include an analysis for the concentration-effect relationship of protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL-protein) as a sensitive, early marker of lung edema. This retrospective analysis also addresses whether common denominators can be found for different aerosol sizes of direct and indirect irritants, such as monomeric and polymeric diphenylmethane-4,4′- diisocyanate (mMDI and pMDI), naphthylene diisocyanate (NDI), dicyclohexylmethane-4,4′-diisocyanate (HMDI), 2,4-triisopropyl-benzene- diisocyanate (TRIDI) and substances (e.g., chlorofluoroalkyl side-chain fungicides) known to decompose to irritant intermediates in the lining fluids of the airways. Collectively, this analysis shows that for irritant aerosols both the concentration and the particle size are equally important for the outcome of the test, independent of whether the endpoint chosen is lethality or BAL protein. The scientific value of 1-h exposures to high aerosol concentrations, as required by some regulations, could be challenged because high concentrations and high respirability of aerosol appear to be mutually exclusive, as shown for mMDI and NDI (LC50 &gt; 2000 mg/m3). Thus, for a meaningful risk characterization, test results from inhalation studies with 'contrived properties' due to the specific techniques employed need to be compared with the real properties of substances as marketed, handled and used. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","1,5 naphthalenediisocyanate; 2,4 triisopropylbenzene diisocyanate; dicyclohexylmethane 4,4' diisocyanate; diphenylmethane 4,4' diisocyanate; fungicide; isocyanic acid derivative; unclassified drug; aerosol; airway; animal experiment; animal model; concentration response; controlled study; female; inhalation; lethality; lung edema; lung lavage; male; mortality; nonhuman; particle size; priority journal; rat; respiratory system; review; risk assessment; toxicity testing; Acute Toxicity Tests; Administration, Inhalation; Aerosols; Animals; Cyanates; Irritants; Isocyanates; Lethal Dose 50; Naphthalenes; Polyurethanes; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment"

Major attention is paid to experimental and theoretical IR spectroscopy data. Differential thermal analysis, polarization microscopy, and X-ray diffraction data are also taken into account. A more detailed treatment is presented on IR spectrum simulation based on data about the conformational lability of molecules and their specific (H-bonding) intermolecular interactions. The first mechanism is responsible for the conformational type of polymorphism in LACs and for the structure of the latter in solid crystal (SC) and liquid crystal (LC) states and in isotropic liquids (ILs). The second mechanism complements the structure-forming aspect of polymorphism in carboxylates, which is due to a rearrangement of hydrogen bond systems in H-complexes during polymorphic transitions to the LC and IL states. Both mechanisms are reflected in IR absorption spectra.

Several products have completed safety trials and are presently undergoing investigation for their efficacy. In the near future, the clinician will likely employ these products in the management of a variety of patient populations. Though similar in their oxygen carrying capacity, each agent possesses distinct physiologic effects. Understanding of the benefits and shortcomings of the various compounds is essential in order to optimally utilize them in various clinical settings. This review provides an overview of recent developments in the field of oxygen therapeutics and highlights results of clinical trials. Recent findings: Modified hemoglobin solutions of human or bovine origin and perfluorochemical- based emulsions are in advanced stages of clinical testing. Bovine hemoglobin-based solutions have been associated with vascular reactivity, methemoglobin formation and development of antibodies. Larger safety trials are necessary before they can find widespread use. Polymerized human hemoglobin solutions have a favorable safety profile in early trials and have been effective as a resuscitation fluid in circumstances when red cells may be unavailable. Unfortunately, outdated human blood, the substrate for this product, is itself in short supply. Perfluorocarbons similarly reduce the need for allogeneic transfusion, but the need for high-inspired oxygen levels currently limits use. Recombinant, polymer-encapsulated and additional forms of chemically modified hemoglobins are being developed and are undergoing testing in animal models.

Therefore, we have designated norharman as a ""co-mutagen"". Since, humans are simultaneously exposed to norharman and aromatic amines in daily life, it is important to clarify the mechanisms of its co-mutagenic action to further understanding of the potential genotoxic effects in humans. Regarding the mechanisms of this action of norharman with aniline, a mutagenic compound, 9-(4′-aminophenyl)-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole[aminophenylnorharman (APNH)] is produced by their interaction, and converted to the hydroxyamino derivative which eventually forms the DNA adduct, dG-C8-APNH through possible ultimate reactive forms with esterification, and this induces mutations. Also other aminophenyl-β-carboline compounds, such as 9-(4′-amino-3′- methylphenyl)-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole[amino-3′-methylphenylnorharman (3′-AMPNH)], 9-(4′-amino-2′-methylphenyl)-9H-pyrido[3,4-b] indole [amino-2′-methylphenylnorharman (2′-AMPNH)], 9-(4′-aminophenyl)-1-methyl-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole[aminophenylharman (APH)] and 9-(4′-amino-3′-methylphenyl)-1-methyl-9H-pyrido[3,4-b] indole[amino-3′-methylphenylharman (AMPH)], have been found on reaction of norharman or harman with aniline or toluidine isomers. These compounds showed mutagenic and clastogenic actions in bacterial and mammalian cells. Among them, APNH demonstrated the most potent activity, and it was most extensively studied. When APNH was administered as a single dose to F344 rats, severe testicular toxicity was observed after 6 days. Moreover, liver preneoplastic lesions (GST-P-positive foci) in the liver clearly developed in animals fed 10-50ppm of APNH in the diet for 4 weeks. Since, APNH was detected in 24h urine of rats upon simultaneous administration with norharman and aniline by gavage, it is likely to be also produced from norharman and aniline in the human body. From these findings, it is suggested that aminophenyl-β-carboline derivatives may be classified as one of the novel types of endogenous mutagens and carcinogens. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Bacteria; Carcinogens; Cells; DNA; Esterification; Mutagens; Tobacco; Clastogenic actions; Norharman; Amines; 9 (4' amino 2' methylphenyl) 9h pyrido[3,4 b]indole(amino 2' methylphenylnorharman); 9 (4' amino 3' methylphenyl) 1 methyl 9h pyrido[3,4 b]indole(amino 3' methylphenylharman); 9 (4' amino 3' methylphenyl) 9h pyrido[3,4 b]indole(amino 3' methylphenylnorharman); 9 (4' aminophenyl) 1 methyl 9h pyrido[3,4 b]indole(aminophenylharman); 9 (4' aminophenyl) 9h pyrido[3,4 b]indole(aminophenylnorharman); aniline; aromatic amine; beta carboline derivative; cigarette smoke; glutathione transferase; harman; hydroxyamino acid; indole derivative; methyl group; mutagenic agent; phenyl group; tolonium chloride; unclassified drug; bacterial cell; bacterial strain; chemical interaction; chemical reaction; chemical structure; classification; cooking; dietary intake; disease course; DNA adduct; esterification; feeding; food; genotoxicity; human; in vivo study; isomer; liver tumor; mammal cell; metabolism; mutation; nonhuman; priority journal; rat strain; review; Salmonella; Salmonella typhimurium; synthesis; testis; toxicity; urine level; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Mammalia; Salmonella; Salmonella typhimurium; Salmonella typhimurium; Typhimurium"

Virtually all children have been exposed to this virus by age two. RSV causes common cold symptoms in most patients. In vulnerable children, RSV can progress to bronchiolitis and/or pneumonia with an increased chance of significant morbidity or death. The nature of the virus and mode of infection protects it from the human immune system. Treatment for RSV is largely supportive. Key elements of treatment are maintenance of hydration, and oxygenation, as well as keeping the airways clear of mucus. Prevention of RSV in vulnerable infants is important because of the increased morbidity and mortality. A modest effort spent identifying vulnerable infants, educating the parents about RSV and its prevention, and providing immunoprophylaxis to those who qualify for it, increases the chances that these vulnerable children get through the first several years of life without RSV bronchiolitis. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Thawed RBC must have the glycerol removed, but the recovered cells have normal survival in humans. Freezing has been used to store RBC of rare phenotypes for more than 40 years. In the 1960s and 1970s, when medical technology and blood use were expanding rapidly and liquid whole blood and RBC storage were limited to 3 weeks, many attempts were made to expand the use of frozen RBC for meeting the needs for a stable blood supply and to have RBC reserves for emergencies. These attempts have largely been abandoned because of the cost of freezing, storing and processing, better management of the larger and longer lived RBC inventory, concerns about the safety of stored RBC that have not received the most up-to-date testing and the losses associated with the short shelf life of thawed RBC. New automated frozen RBC processing systems will potentially allow extending the outdate of thawed RBC to 2 weeks, but will not materially effect the costs or losses associated with the use of frozen RBC. RBC freezing will have little effect on the logistics of blood supply.","aluminum; glycerol; politef; rhesus D antigen; alloimmunization; automation; blood; blood bank; blood donor; blood transfusion; body fluid; cell protection; cell survival; cost; emergency treatment; erythrocyte; erythrocyte preservation; fractionation; freezing; human; medical technology; phenotype; review; safety; shelf life; thawing; vascularization; Blood Banks; Blood Preservation; Cryopreservation; Erythrocyte Transfusion; Erythrocytes; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans"

This review deals with the synthesis and the polymerization of fluorostyrene bearing the fluorine atom(s) in α and/or β position, mainly. These syntheses involve different reactants such as α,α-difluoroethylbenzene, or aryl iodides and vinylidene fluoride, or styrene and fluorination agents for α-fluorostyrene and sodium 1,2-difluoroacetate, or triphenylphosphine, fluorotrichloromethane, zinc dust and a ketone for the β-fluorostyrene.

The second part reported several synthetic routes to obtain α,β- or β,β-difluorostyrene bearing different reactants such as vinyl zincic reagent (F2C=C(CF3)ZnX (X=Br or I)) and palladium catalysts. This review also describes the synthesis of α,β,β-trifluorostyrene functionalized by a halogen or an acid group, using mainly a cross-coupling reaction between perfluoroalkenylzinc reagent and aryl iodides in the presence of a palladium catalyst. The thermocyclodimerization of α,β,β-trifluorostyrene and the emulsion copolymerization of dimethylphosphonate-4-substitued-α,β,β-trifluorostyrene with α,β,β-trifluorostyrene are studied.

We analyzed the quality of the control groups managed with the standard treatment, noting data that may have altered these results, as well as analyzing the quality of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and treatment compliance. In light of this analysis, we believe that further trials should be carried out with fairly balanced prognostic factors to demonstrate beyond a doubt that concurrent chemoradiotherapy is superior to radiotherapy alone.

However, the only successful transgenic bioreactors have been based on mammals. We have developed two key techniques for obtaining transgenic birds. For bird embryo culture, we identified that the low rate of hatchability of cultured embryos is caused by limited oxygen and calcium availability. In quail embryo culture using a chicken eggshell as a culture vessel, hatchability increased to 80% by the supplement of calcium lactate in addition to oxygen aeration. A fully artificial vessel for quail embryo culture using a gas-permeable Teflon membrane was also designed. Although the hatchability was lower than that of cultures using a surrogate eggshell, we succeeded in hatching of bird embryos using a fully artificial vessel. For transgene introduction, a replication-defective pantropic retroviral vector based on Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) was injected to laid embryos at the blastodermal stage, and the embryos were hatched in vitro to generate G0 birds. The viral vector sequence was detected in the tissues of all G0 birds. The germ-line transmission efficiency was more than 80%. Plural copies of the transgene were inserted into the genome of G1 transgenic progeny.","liposome; recombinant protein; animal; biosynthesis; bird; egg shell; gene expression; gene transfer; gene vector; genetic transformation; genetics; metabolism; physiology; prenatal development; quail; Retrovirus; review; synthesis; transgenic animal; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Birds; Egg Shell; Gene Expression; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genetic Vectors; Liposomes; Quail; Recombinant Proteins; Retroviridae; Transformation, Genetic; MLCS; MLOWN"

Infant markets already exist and, in 2002, they traded perhaps $10 million worth of emissions allowances. We estimate conservatively that, by 2010, the EU scheme will trade as much as $1 billion in allowances each year. The motor of the carbon markets is a worldwide effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Its most visible symbol is the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, formally known as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Even if Kyoto is not ratified and, despite the US's decision to opt out of the treaty, the genie of greenhouse-gas reduction is out of the bottle. We believe that trading of greenhouse gases will be a real, day-to-day activity by 2010, almost certainly in Europe and probably in Canada and Japan. Carbon trading in these areas will affect the US, whether or not America sets up a programme of its own. The conclusion of this study is that industry should get involved in defining carbon trading-and now-to advance and defend their interests.

Some of the key issues and shortcomings of the PFSA-based PEMFC technology are briefly discussed. These include water management, CO poisoning, hydrogen, reformate and methanol as fuels, cooling, and heat recovery. As a means to solve these shortcomings, high-temperature polymer electrolyte membranes for operation above 100 °C are under active development. This treatise is devoted to a review of the area encompassing modified PFSA membranes, alternative sulfonated polymer and their composite membranes, and acid-base complex membranes. PFSA membranes have been modified by swelling with nonvolatile solvents and preparing composites with hydrophilic oxides and solid proton conductors. DMFC and H2/O 2(air) cells based on modified PFSA membranes have been successfully operated at temperatures up to 120 °C under ambient pressure and up to 150 °C under 3-5 atm. Alternative polymers are selected from silicon- and fluorine-containing inorganic polymers or aromatic hydrocarbon polymers and functionalized by sulfonation. The sulfonated hydrocarbons and their inorganic composites are potentially promising for high-temperature operation. High conductivities have been obtained at temperatures up to 180 °C. Acid-base complex membranes constitute another class of electrolyte membranes. A high-temperature PEMFC based on H3PO4-doped PBI has been demonstrated for operation at temperatures up to 200 °C under ambient pressure. The advanced features include high CO tolerance, simple thermal and water management, and possible integration with the fuel processing unit.","Water management; Carbon monoxide; Electrolytes; Fluorine; Fuel cells; High temperature operations; Hydrogen; Methanol; Silicon; Sulfonation; Waste heat utilization; Polymeric membranes; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; hydrogen; methanol; perfluoro compound; perfluorosulfonic acid; polymer; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; water; catalyst support; conductance; high temperature procedures; kinetics; membrane; polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell; review; technology; temperature"

The aim of catheter use is to optimise administration of medication and minimise complications such as thrombus formation, thrombophlebitis and sepsis. Catheters made from teflon are less flexible, less durable and stimulate more tissue reaction than polyurethane or silicon. However silicon catheters are more expensive and complicated to insert. Generally, for veterinary practice, the biostability and cost of polyurethane catheters make them preferable for short and long-term use. The smallest diameter catheter should be selected to minimise internal vessel wall contact and irritation without compromising medication delivery. The site of insertion varies with individual preference, vessel access and patient compliance. The jugular, cephalic, saphenous, ear, lateral thoracic and subcutaneous abdominal veins are accessible. Hair removal and a thorough aseptic skin preparation should be performed prior to catheter insertion. Daily maintenance is required to detect complications and maximise catheter longevity. Potential complications include thrombus formation, thromboembolism, bacterial colonisation and septicaemia, blood loss and air embolism. Permanent or transient skin dwelling bacteria are commonly isolated if sepsis occurs.

Since 1929 it has been known that filling the lung with liquid, instead of air, reduces these pressures by at least half. However, although most liquids are unable to dissolve sufficient amounts of oxygen, perfluorocarbons (PFCs; bio-chemically stable liquids) are able to dissolve high amounts of oxygen at normobaric pressures. Instillation of PFCs into the lung with superimposed mechanical ventilation allows normal gas exchange both in healthy and diseased lungs. The technique of superimposed ventilation is known as partial liquid ventilation (PLV). Our group was the first to apply this technique in an animal model of ARDS. The knowledge and experience gained from these first experiments have provided an extensive and ongoing interest in PLV in ARDS. In this review we will focus on the use of PFCs in ARDS. We discuss the current knowledge on the effect of PFCs on hemodynamics, progress of lung injury, anti-inflammatory properties and the possible side-effects. Furthermore, data on clinical trials are discussed and guidelines for future application of PFCs in ARDS are presented.","fluorocarbon; oxygen; surfactant; adult respiratory distress syndrome; airway pressure; antiinflammatory activity; capillary; clinical trial; hemodynamics; human; liquid ventilation; lung alveolus; lung injury; practice guideline; review; surface tension"

Soon after the mutated gene was identified in 1989, investigators demonstrated that transfer of a normal copy of the CF gene corrected ion transport abnormalities, thus validating the potential for use of gene therapy for this autosomal recessive disease. However, subsequent studies in a variety of in vitro and animal models, and more limited human studies, have revealed several obstacles to gene therapy for CF: (1) The incomplete understanding of CF lung disease pathogenesis, particularly the relative importance of ion transport and other cellular abnormalities (including glycoconjugate processing, pH regulation of intracellular organelles, and membrane trafficking), and of surface epithelial versus submucosal gland CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) expression, generates uncertainty as to the necessary target cells for gene transfer and the optimum end point(s) for short-term human studies. (2) The airway epithelium has protective barriers against viral infection that impair gene transfer with several vectors, including recombinant viruses and DNA conjugates. Improvement in DNA transfer technology will be necessary for successful gene therapy. (3) Immune responses to recombinant viruses and inflammatory effects of bacterial DNA are only partially understood and appear to limit efficacy, particularly with repeated administration. Identification of these obstacles is prerequisite for progress, and recent studies with novel DNA delivery methods appear promising.","adenovirus vector; calcium phosphate; carboxymethylcellulose; DNA; egtazic acid; glycoconjugate; lentivirus vector; liposome; perfluoro compound; plasmid DNA; polycation; retrovirus vector; surfactant; virus vector; cell organelle; cell surface; clinical trial; cystic fibrosis; gene targeting; gene therapy; gene transfer; gene vector; human; immune response; inflammation; ion transport; membrane transport; pathogenesis; pH; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; respiratory epithelium; review; stem cell; submucosa; virus infection; virus recombinant"

However, it is becoming apparent that current insulin-sensitising antihyperglycaemic therapy, represented by the biguanide metformin and the thiazolidionediones (TZD) pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, may exert powerful adjunctive anti-inflammatory actions with the potential to modify not only dysmetabolic cardiovascular disease but also Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) incidence.

Recognising the relationships between inflammatory mediators and processes, and the pathophysiology of oxidative stress, vascular endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell decompensation, is likely to introduce a new treatment paradigm in the management of syndrome X, T2DM and dysmetabolic cardiovascular disease. Such a paradigm, in addition to justifying the further development of anti-inflammatory TZD and non-TZD peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonists, can also be expected to clinically target markers of systemic inflammation, cell adhesion molecule expression, mononucleocyte activation, reactive oxygen species generation, and intracellular redox-sensitive, pro-inflammatory transcription factor activation.

This review focuses on current and future advances in preservation technology. The key areas of advance are additives to preservation solutions, alternatives/adjuncts to preservation solutions including perfluorocarbons. A major area of advance is in the modulation of organs during the storage period. This may be achieved by biochemical additives or genetic manipulation. Machine perfusion technology is improving, and this is discussed together with the recent concept of warm (normothermic) perfusion as an alternative means of preservation. The authors provide an overview over the current methods of organ preservation. Cold storage, effective in the short-term is insufficient for marginal organs, does not allow assessment of viability markers, and provokes ischaemic injury. Potential strategies for minimising ischaemic injury include additives to preservation solutions; the two-layer method with perfluorcarbons and UW solution - at present limited to pancreas preservation; organ modulation; organ preconditioning and genetic modification of organs. In particular, the authors illuminate the potential in a reappraisal of the concept of normothermic perfusion.","adenosine triphosphate; calcium channel blocking agent; drug additive; fluorocarbon; heat shock protein; lazaroid; pfithrin alpa; preservative; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; University of Wisconsin solution; cell swelling; cell viability; cryopreservation; DNA modification; genetic manipulation; graft injury; graft survival; human; ion transport; ischemia; machine perfusion technology; medical technology; normothermic perfusion; organ donor; organ preservation; organ transplantation; organ viability; pancreas preservation; perfusion; preservation technology; priority journal; review; warm perfusion; Cold; Humans; Ischemia; Organ Preservation; Organ Preservation Solutions; Perfusion; Tissue and Organ Procurement; Tissue Donors"

In this review, the polymers that exhibit no to very low degradation in aqueous and biological environments will be covered. The applications of various polymers both in traditional and emerging medical areas is discussed in the context of its chemical structure to better enable material selection for biomedical research.","biomaterial; bone cement; contraceptive agent; dacron; ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer; etonogestrel; palacos; pilocarpine; politef; poloxamer; polyetherurethan; polymer; silicon dioxide; silicone oil; aqueous solution; biocompatibility; biodegradation; catheter; cell encapsulation; chemical interaction; chemical structure; drug delivery system; hemodialysis; hydrolysis; implant; review; syringe; tissue regeneration; Biocompatible Materials; Biodegradation, Environmental; Drug Carriers; Drug Implants; Forecasting; Molecular Structure; Polymers; Prostheses and Implants"

Important requirements are adequate membrane mechanical strength at levels of functionalization (generally sulfonation) and hydration allowing high proton conductivity, and stability in the aggressive environment of a working fuel cell, in particular thermohydrolytic and chemical stability. This review provides an overview of progress made in the development of proton-conducting hydrocarbon and heterocychic-based polymers for proton exchange and direct methanol fuel cells and describes the various approaches made to polymer modification/synthesis and salient properties of the materials formed, including those relating to proton transport and proton conductivity, e.g., water diffusion and electro-osmotic drag. The microstructure, deduced from small angle X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements of representative non-fluorinated polymers is compared with that of perfluorosulfonic acid membranes. Different degradation mechanisms and aging processes that can result in chemical and morphological alteration are considered, and recent characterization of membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) in direct methanol and hydrogen-air (oxygen) fuel cells completes this review of the state of the art. While several types of non-fluorinated polymer membrane have demonstrated lifetimes of 500-4000 h, only a limited number of systems exist that hold promise for long-term operation above 100°C.","Aromatic polymers; Ion exchange membranes; Ionic conduction; Protons; X ray diffraction; Membrane-electrode assemblies (MEA); Fuel cells"

Methods: Twenty-four patients, 11 males and 13 females, age 24 to 74 (mean 50.5 ± 13.1) provided one site with an intraosseous defect ≥4 mm and were divided equally and randomly into two groups. Following debridement both groups were grafted with a bovine-derived xenograft coated with a synthetic cell-binding peptide; then the test group received an NP membrane and the control group received a P membrane. All defects were reentered after 9 months. Measurements were performed by a masked examiner. Results: There were no statistically significant differences (P >0.05) between NP and P groups for any open or closed probing measurement at any time. Similar open initial defect depth for the NP group and P groups (4.8 versus 5.0 mm) demonstrated identical 9-month defect fill of 2.8 mm (57%) for both groups. A difference in crestal resorption for the NP compared to the P group (0.4 versus 0.8 mm) accounted for the difference in mean percent defect resolution, which was 67% for NP compared to 72% for the P group. Overall, nine (75%) of the NP group defects and eight (67%) of the P group defects showed more than 50% defect fill.

Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were given 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg PFOS daily by gavage from gestation day (GD) 2 to GD 21; pregnant CD-1 mice were treated with 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg PFOS from GD 1 to GD 18. Controls received 0.5% Tween-20 vehicle (1 ml/kg for rats and 10 ml/kg for mice). At parturition, newborns were observed for clinical signs and survival. All animals were born alive and initially appeared to be active. In the highest dosage groups (10 mg/kg for rat and 20 mg/kg for mouse), the neonates became pale, inactive, and moribund within 30-60 min, and all died soon afterward. In the 5 mg/kg (rat) and 15 mg/kg (mouse) dosage groups, the neonates also became moribund but survived for a longer period of time (8-12 h). Over 95% of these animals died within 24 h. Approximately 50% of offspring died at 3 mg/kg for rat and 10 mg/kg for mouse. Cross-fostering the PFOS-exposed rat neonates (5 mg/kg) to control nursing dams failed to improve survival. Serum concentrations of PFOS in newborn rats mirrored the maternal administered dosage and were similar to those in the maternal circulation at GD 21; PFOS levels in the surviving neonates declined in the ensuing days. Small but significant and persistent growth lags were detected in surviving rat and mouse pups exposed to PFOS prenatally, and slight delays in eye opening were noted. Significant increases in liver weight were observed in the PFOS-exposed mouse pups. Serum thyroxine levels were suppressed in the PFOS-treated rat pups, although triiodothyronine and thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] levels were not altered. Choline acetyltransferase activity (an enzyme that is sensitive to thyroid status) in the prefrontal cortex of rat pups exposed to PFOS prenatally was slightly reduced, but activity in the hippocampus was not affected. Development of learning, determined by T-maze delayed alternation in weanling rats, was not affected by PFOS exposure. These results indicate that in utero exposure to PFOS severely compromised postnatal survival of neonatal rats and mice, and caused delays in growth and development that were accompanied by hypothyroxinemia in the surviving rat pups.","choline acetyltransferase; liothyronine; perfluorooctane; sulfonic acid derivative; thyrotropin; thyroxine; animal experiment; animal tissue; clinical feature; concentration (parameters); controlled study; developmental disorder; environmental exposure; enzyme activity; eye; female; gestational age; growth inhibition; learning; liothyronine blood level; liver weight; mouse; newborn; nonhuman; perinatal period; prefrontal cortex; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; rat; review; survival rate; thyrotropin blood level; thyroxine blood level; Administration, Oral; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Body Weight; Choline O-Acetyltransferase; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Fluorocarbons; Liver; Longevity; Maternal Exposure; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains; Organ Size; Prefrontal Cortex; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Teratogens; Thyroxine; Animalia; Rodentia"

There is increasing experience in its use in management of anemia in the critically ill. Methods: This review focuses on clinical, experimental papers regarding erythropoietin usage in the critically ill from the Medline database. Data from our intensive care unit (ICU) were also included. Results: Anemia occurs commonly in the critically ill during ICU stay. Erythropoietin responses are blunted in MODS. EPO is an effective means of increasing haemoglobin and reduces blood transfusion. High doses 300-600U/kg of EPO produce erythropoietic responses within 6 days. For the general critical care patient, studies to date have not shown any increase in adverse events, nor any mortality benefit. Conclusion: Clinical indications include those in whom transfusion is difficult, such as Jehovah's witnesses, or patients with antibodies. Data in the critically ill support the use of 600U/kg subcutaneously weekly for 4 weeks, with adjuvant therapy of oral iron 300mg/day, vitamin C 100mg/day, folate 5mg/day and possibly vitamin E. We recommend commencing when Hct is less than 30% in patients likely to remain in the ICU beyond one week. Patients should be monitored for hypertension and haemoglobin response. Erythropoietin use is now established as an efficacious, easy to use and safe method of treating anemia in the critically ill.","alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; blood group antibody; diaspirin crosslinked hemoglobin; folic acid; hemoglobin; iron; oxygen; perfluorooctyl bromide; recombinant erythropoietin; anaphylaxis; anemia; blood clotting disorder; blood transfusion; clinical trial; confusion; convulsion; critical illness; disease exacerbation; drug bioavailability; drug blood level; drug efficacy; drug fatality; drug half life; drug hypersensitivity; drug indication; drug megadose; drug response; drug safety; drug use; flu like syndrome; hallucination; headache; hematocrit; hemoglobin determination; human; hyperbaric oxygen; hypertension; intensive care unit; length of stay; medical literature; MEDLINE; nonhuman; pruritus; rash; religion; review; spleen infarction; thrombocytosis; thromboembolism; thrombosis; urticaria"

PFOS is an environmentally persistent compound used as a surfactant and occurs as a degradation product of both perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride and substituted perfluorooctane sulfonamido components found in many commercial and consumer applications. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were given 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg PFOS daily by gavage from gestational day (GD) 2 to GD 20; CD-1 mice were similarly treated with 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg PFOS from GD 1 to GD 17. Controls received 0.5% Tween-20 vehicle (1 ml/kg for rats and 10 ml/kg for mice). Maternal weight gain, food and water consumption, and serum chemistry were monitored. Rats were euthanized on GD 21 and mice on GD 18. PFOS levels in maternal serum and in maternal and fetal livers were determined. Maternal weight gains in both species were suppressed by PFOS in a dose-dependent manner, likely attributed to reduced food and water intake. Serum PFOS levels increased with dosage, and liver levels were approximately fourfold higher than serum. Serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the PFOS-treated rat dams were significantly reduced as early as one week after chemical exposure, although no feedback response of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was observed. A similar pattern of reduction in T4 was also seen in the pregnant mice. Maternal serum triglycerides were significantly reduced, particularly in the high-dose groups, although cholesterol levels were not affected. In the mouse dams, PFOS produced a marked enlargement of the liver at 10 mg/kg and higher dosages. In the rat fetuses, PFOS was detected in the liver but at levels nearly half of those in the maternal counterparts, regardless of administered doses. In both rodent species, PFOS did not alter the numbers of implantations or live fetuses at term, although small deficits in fetal weight were noted in the rat. A host of birth defects, including cleft palate, anasarca, ventricular septal defect, and enlargement of the right atrium, were seen in both rats and mice, primarily in the 10 and 20 mg/kg dosage groups, respectively. Our results demonstrate both maternal and developmental toxicity of PFOS in the rat and mouse.","cholesterol; liothyronine; perfluorooctane; sulfonic acid derivative; surfactant; thyrotropin; thyroxine; triacylglycerol; water; anasarca; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; birth defect; blood chemistry; cardiomegaly; cholesterol blood level; cleft palate; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental exposure; feedback system; female; fetus weight; fluid intake; food intake; gestational age; heart right atrium; heart ventricle septum defect; hepatomegaly; liothyronine blood level; liver; mouse; nidation; nonhuman; pregnancy; prenatal development; prenatal exposure; prenatal screening; rat; review; thyroxine blood level; tissue distribution; triacylglycerol blood level; weight gain; Abnormalities, Drug-Induced; Administration, Oral; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Body Weight; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drinking; Eating; Female; Fetal Weight; Fetus; Fluorocarbons; Liver; Maternal Exposure; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains; Organ Size; Pregnancy; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reproduction; Teratogens; Thyroxine; Triglycerides; Triiodothyronine; Animalia; Rodentia"

During the second part of 1946 he was employed in PLIVA, Pharmaceutical and Chemical Company in Zagreb, in the Department of Chemotherapeutical Drugs Production. For two years he worked on the production of neoarsphenamine and on the synthesis and tuberculostatic activity of pyrrol-azo-phenylarsonic acids and pyrrol-azo-benzoic acid. By means of toxicological and spectroscopic methods he proved, with Nikola Muić, the existence of cis-trans isomers of 3,3′-diamino-4,4′-dihydroxyarsenobenzene. In 1950 he worked as a member of ""Foreign Student Summer Project"" at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass, on the synthesis of β-carotene in the laboratory of Professor Nicholas A. Milas. During the academic year 1952/53 he continued the work on the synthesis of polyenes in MIT, Cambridge. He obtained his Ph. D. degree under the supervision of Professor Krešimir Balenović in 1952, with whom he worked on the stereochemistry of sulfur containing β-amino acids: L-β-methionine, L-β-cystine and L-β-homodjenkolic acid, and several dipeptides and tripeptides of β-amino acids containing sulfur. Of interest are his works on the stereochemistry of chloramphenicol, β-nor-pseudo-ephedrine and a series of β-propiothiolactones and poly-propiothiolactones. The absolute configuration of chloramphenicol was determined by the synthesis of natural antibiotic from D-serine. Attempts to prepare mercaptochloramphenicol in which -CH2OH group was substituted with -CH2SH, has shown that S-benzyl-N-phthaloyl-L-cysteinyl chloride with two moles of AlCl3 gave α-phthalimido-β-propiothiolactone, while with 1 mole of AlCl3 poly(N-phthaloyl-cysteine) was obtained. The synthesis of 15,15′-dihydro-β-carotene in 1960 was of considerable interest, since at that time it was considered that this compound during the synthesis undergoes a double allylic shift, thus being rear-ranged to 7,7′-dihydro-β-carotene. The synthesis performed in PLIVA was the first successful synthetic preparation of 15,15′-dihydro-β-carotene. The academic year 1957/58 he spent as a fellow of Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in Urbana, III., working with Professor Roger Adams on the configuration of C1 and C8 atoms of pyrrolizidine moieties of Senecio alkaloids. The configuration was determined by chemical interconversion of optically active compounds of known configuration by means of stereospecific reactions. Soon after he returned from the University of Illinois, Urbana, he became engaged in the organization of development of petrochemical industry in Zagreb. As newly appointed Research Director of OKI he organized the first modern equipped research institute actively engaged in the development of new polymeric material and petrochemicals of commercial interest. Research activities were mostly devoted to the synthesis and stereochemistry of optically active and specialty polymers like polyamides, substituted butadienes, β-substituted styrenes and propiothiolactones. Of interest is to mention his contributions to the studies of the mechanism of alternating copolymerization of donor-acceptor monomers which form charge-transfer complexes. On the bases of a large number of alternating copolymerizations described in published papers and reviews, it was found that the values of complexation constants do not depend on steric factors, while the rates of complexation are significantly dependent on steric factors. It was further found that alternating copolymerization via the charge-transfer monomer copolymerization, follows the concerted mechanism under the simultaneous crosspropagation of monomers and addition of complexes during the propagation. The work which is still under investigation is a synthesis of crosslinked polymers and copolymers which contain selectively imprinted regions. As visiting professor he presented lectures at the University of Merseburg, in Max Planck Institute in Mainz, University of Ann Arbour, Michigan, University of Arizona, and as lecturer he participated in Summer Schools on Optically Active Polymers at Forge-les-Eaux in France. During the summer periods of 1980 and 1990 he participated as lecturer in Summer Schools on Polymers, NATO Institute of Science, Tirrenia, Italy. With his coworkers he presented a large number of plenary lectures and reports on various IUPAC Symposia: Madrid, Budapest, Amhest, Mainz, Helsinki, Strasbourgh, Paris, Louvain, Bruxelles, and in 1977 he presented an introductory lecture concerning the mechanism of alternating copolymerization at the Gordon Conference in New London, NH. He also participated as lecturer at the international conferences on development of petrochemistry in Baghdad and Abu Dhabi. He spent his entire professional life in industrial organizations: PLIVA, OKI, INA where he worked as production engineer, research director and finally as member of management board until the retirement in 1985. At the same time he was full professor (h.c.) at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Matematics, University of Zagreb, for many years teaching courses of stereochemistry and synthetic organic chemistry in graduate and postgraduate studies. He was one of initiators of the organization of postgraduate courses in the field of macromolecular science in Zagreb. With his coworkers he published more than 200 scientific papers, mostly in leading international journals, 70 professional and review articles, 31 patents and more than 100 scientific and review articles published in proceedings of international and domestic conferences and symposia. Studies on synthesis and stereochemistry of polymers which are of interest as new materials in technical fields, specially as materials of importance in petroleum and petrochemical industry, are continued after the retirement through the collaboration with scientists from INA. Summary of some important research and development results: -Spectroscopic and toxicological proof of the existence of cis-trans isomers of 3,3′- diamino-4,4′-dihidroxy arsenobenzene. - Total synthesis of β-carotene and 15,15′-dihydro-β-carotene. - Synthesis of optically active sulfur containing L-β-aminoacids. - Configuration of β-nor-pseudo-ephedrine, chloramphenicol and β-propiothiolactones. - Configuration of C1- and C8-atoms of monocrotaline. - Contribution to the development of petrochemical industry and specially to the development of macromolecular science. - Studies in the synthesis and characterization of optically active polymers. - Preparation of alternating copolymers formed through the participation of charge-transfer complexes.","Amino acids; Benzene; Charge transfer; Copolymerization; Drug products; Petrochemicals; Polyamides; Spectroscopic analysis; Stereochemistry; Synthesis (chemical); Technical presentations; Petrochemistry; Chemical engineering"

Excessive or inappropriate activation can result in tissue damage, classically illustrated in immune-mediated nephritis. In addition, complement forms a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, helping to prepare and focus T and B lymphocyte responses. More recent research in renal allograft models has shown that complement-inhibited and complement-deficient animals have reduced inflammatory injury and lowered antidonor immune responses. Furthermore, it is known that the transplanted kidney is a significant site of local synthesis of C3, although until recently the relative contribution of locally produced C3 to transplant injury was unknown. Current evidence indicates that defective local synthesis of C3 both reduces tissue injury and lowers the antidonor T cell response, substantially increasing graft survival. Among various possible explanations to account for these findings, the data favours a direct effect of complement on alloreactive T cell stimulation. Study of complement gene regulation by common immunosuppressive agents suggests that they do not influence local complement synthesis. Alternative approaches are therefore required to control the local effect of complement in the extravascular tissue compartment of the graft.","calcineurin inhibitor; complement; complement component C3; complement component C3a; complement component C3c; complement component C4; complement component C5; complement component C5a; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement receptor; corticosteroid; cyclosporin; immunosuppressive agent; peptide fragment; tacrolimus; acute disease; animal; animal model; animal tissue; biosynthesis; complement system; gene expression regulation; graft rejection; human; human cell; immune response; immunology; immunosuppressive treatment; kidney allograft rejection; kidney graft rejection; kidney transplantation; lymphocyte activation; metabolism; mouse; nonhuman; organ transplantation; pathology; review; T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; Acute Disease; Animals; Complement C3c; Complement C4; Complement System Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation; Graft Rejection; Humans; Kidney Transplantation; Lymphocyte Activation; Mice; Peptide Fragments; T-Lymphocytes"

An exception to this is 'protective ventilation' using reduced tidal volumes (to lower airway pressure) and increased PEEP (to reduce pulmonary collapse). Results of trials of protective ventilation have been encouraging, and the technique should now be adopted more widely. High frequency ventilation, inverse ratio ventilation, prone positioning and inhaled nitric oxide are all techniques that may be considered when, in spite of optimal artificial ventilation, the patient's gas exchange remains dangerously poor.

Today, the technique of choice for analysis of these groups of substances is liquid-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). In the last decades, this technique has experienced an impressive progress that has made possible the analysis of many environmental pollutants in a faster, more convenient, and more sensitive way, and, in some cases, the analysis of compounds that could not be determined before. This article reviews the LC-MS and LC-MS-MS methods published so far for the determination of alkylphenolic surfactants, steroid sex hormones and drugs in the aquatic environment. Practical considerations with regards to the analysis of these groups of substances by using different mass spectrometers (single quadrupole, ion trap and triple quadrupole instruments, etc.), interfaces and ionization and monitoring modes, are presented.

These oligomers can form the self-assembled molecular aggregates with the aggregations of end-capped fluoroalkyl groups in aqueous and organic media. Fluorinated self-assembled molecular aggregates containing carboxyl and sulfo groups were suggested to interact with positively charged HIV-1 to exhibit a potent anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro. In contrast, fluoroalkyl end-capped oligomers containing cationic segments exhibited not only the unique surface active properties imparted by fluorine as well as the usual low-molecular fluorinated surfactants, but also high surface antibacterial activity. Fluoroalkyl end-capped oligomers containing betaine-type segments were found to cause a gelation where the strong aggregation of the end-capped fluoroalkyl groups is involved in establishing the physical gel network in water and polar organic solvents under non-crosslinked conditions. Similarly, fluoroalkyl end-capped oligomers containing hydroxyl groups could cause a gelation, where the aggregation of fluoroalkyl groups and hydrogen-bonding interaction is involved in establishing a physical gel network in water and polar organic solvents under non-crosslinked conditions. Fluoroalkanoyl peroxide is also a convenient tool for the preparation of new fluoroalkyl end-capped oligomers containing recognition moieties such as diacetone segments.

This feature article presents an overview of what is known of this reactivity, and presents a detailed discussion of the dynamics of some of those reactions that involve making and breaking chemical bonds. The article also presents recent results from a new position-sensitive coincidence spectrometer designed to study the dynamics of dication reactions by detecting, in coincidence, the pair of monocations often formed in such processes. Detecting the pair of product ions in coincidence from an individual reactive event, using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a position sensitive detector, allows their initial velocity vectors to be determined. Experiments studying the electron transfer reactions of atomic dications illustrate the feasibility of this coincidence technique and scattering diagrams obtained from studies of the Ne2+ + Ar collision system are presented. The coincidence technique is particularly suited for the study of reactions which produce three products. For such three-body reactions the coincidence experiment, unlike conventional techniques, allows the initial velocity vectors of all three products to be determined for each reactive event. Illustrative results show that the dissociative electron transfer reaction of CF32+ with Ar proceeds sequentially via the dissociation of highly excited vibrational levels of the electronic ground state of CF3+. In addition, the formation of OCF+ following collisions of CF22+ with H2O proceeds via a long-lived collision complex which decays via charge-separation to form a proton and HF-OCF+. The molecular monocation then dissociates to yield OCF+ and HF.","argon; californium; carbon dioxide; cation; fluorine; ion; isotope; neon; nitrogen; oxygen; perfluoro compound; proton; water; xenon; apparatus; assay; chemical analysis; chemical bond; chemical procedures; chemical reaction; dissociation; dynamics; electron; electron transport; energy; fragmentation reaction; gas; information processing; ion transport; ionization; light scattering; mass spectrometer; mass spectrometry; methodology; molecular dynamics; molecular model; molecule; review; spectrometer; spectroscopy; thermodynamics; velocity; vibration; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy"

This process has been extensively used to effect substitution on a wide variety of substrates. The SRN1 reaction has been studied from both mechanistic and synthetic standpoints. The SRN1 mechanism requires an initiation step. Spontaneous electron transfer (ET) from the nucleophile to the substrate has been observed in a few systems; light stimulation, electrodes, alkali metals or inorganic salt-mediation is used otherwise. There are systems that are totally inert or undergo rather slow substitutions by classical polar mechanisms. Their lack of reactivity is usually due to strain (cycloalkyl and polycycloalkyl halides), steric (cycloalkyl, polycycloalkyl and neopentyl halides), or electronic factors (unactivated aromatic, vinyl halides and perfluoroalkyl halides). For these families of compounds, the nucleophilic substitution can be accomplished by the SRN1 mechanism. Conversely, there is a class of substrates, for which substitution can be achieved through both polar and ET mechanisms; however, the ET pathway is favored in some systems (i.e.: alkyl halides with EWG). We propose to undertake a compilation and critical review on SRN1 reactions dealing with substitutions on aromatic substrates, cycloalkyl, bridgehead, neopentyl, vinyl halides, perfluoroalkyl iodides, aliphatic substrates with EWG in the α position and N,N-dialkyl-p-toluenesulfonamides. With this aim in mind, we expect to cover recent SRN1 substitutions, with an emphasis on the scope of the process in terms of synthetic capability and target applications.","aliphatic compound; amide; aromatic compound; ergot alkaloid; halide; indole derivative; toluenesulfonamide derivative; chemical structure; coupling factor; drug synthesis; electrode; electron transport; experimentation; methodology; polarization; radical reaction; review; substitution reaction"

The adverse consequences of such psychiatric disorders for relatives have been studied since the early 1950s, when psychiatric institutions began discharging patients into the community. According to Treudley (1946) « burden on the family » refers to the consequences for those in close contact with a severely disturbed psychiatric patient. Grad and Sainsbury (1963) and Hoenig and Hamilton (1966) developed the first burden scales for caregivers of severely mentally ill patients, and a number of authors further developed instruments trying to distinguish between « objective » and « subjective » burden. Objective burden concerns the patient's symptoms, behaviour and socio-demographic characteristics, but also the changes in household routine, family or social relations, work, leisure time, physical health... Subjective burden is the mental health and subjective distress among family members. While the first authors refered to those problems which are deemed to be related to, or caused by the patient, Platt et al. (1983) tried to distinguish between the occurrence of a problem, its alleged aetiology, and the perceived distress, when developing the SBAS questionnaire. These authors also proposed separate evaluations of behavioral disturbance and social performance by relatives, and a report of extra-disease stressors in family life. The SBAS is actually the most complete, but also complex instrument for evaluating burden in caregivers. Since 1967 Pasamanick and others proposed questionnaires for burden evaluation in relatives of schizophrenic patients. Relatives may be included in specific psychoeducational programs, but few of these programs have been evaluated in terms of caregiver burden. The theoretical approach in schizophrenia was not different from that one adopted in mentally ill population. Some instruments were validated first in a mentally ill group and then adapted for schizophrenic population. This paper describes the available data about intruments measuring caregiver burden in relatives of schizophrenic patients. Mesures are summarized according to purpose, content and psychometric properties. Sixteen instruments have been collected from the litterature (1955-2001), and 2 instruments developed for relatives of mentally ill have also been taken into account. A group of 5 instruments focuses on the measurement of behavioural disturbance in persons with schizophrenia as perceived by their family members. Eleven scales include behavioural disturbance in a more complete decription of objective burden. Thirteen questionnaires also report the subjective distress in caregivers. One instrument has been developed in french language. Few of these instuments have been developed from a verbatim and really describe the caregiver's point of view. Most of them rely on experts point of view or on previously published studies. The content and domains explored by these instruments are variable. The psychometric properties are poorly documented for a number of them and no information is published about responsiveness. Some validated instruments are the Perceived Family Burden Scale (PFBS) the Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire (IEQ) and the Experience of Caregiving Inventory (ECI). In past studies, researchers more or less agreed about the dimensions that comprise the family burden. There was less agreement with regard to the definition of objective and subjective burden, and quite no agreement about the theoretical approach to the concept of burden. The evaluation of behavioural disturbance should now be excluded from the objective burden dimension. It is a specific domain, both objective and subjective, which can be described as a stressor in the stress-appraisal-coping model. A good approach of this domain can be found in the PFBS. It comprises 24 items and the principal components analysis produces 2 factors (« active » and « passive »), explaining 35 % of the variance, with good consitency and acceptable test-retest reliability. The evaluation is both objective (presence or absence) and subjective (induced distress). The Behavior Disturbance Scale (BDS) may also be taken into account, although it is less validated. This scale derives from the SBAS, modified as a self-questionnaire, with both objective and subjective evaluations of all items. The concept of burden was recently modified in a new theoretical approach by Schene, when developing the IEQ. According to this author, the burden scale is supposed to exclude stressors (patient's behaviors), as well as outcome variables (distress or psychological impairment in caregiver). The « caregiving consequences » section comprises 36 items, which focus on the subjective aspects of the caregiver's experience. Principal component factor analysis generates 4 factors which explain 45 % of the variance: tension, supervision, worrying, urging. The overall caregiving score substantially explains the connection between patient, caregiver, relationship variables and the caregiver's distress. This scale is a valid and simple instrument for caregiving eveluation. The ECI also introduces a new approach of caregiving and rejects the notion of burden. The 66 item version is composed of 10 factors (8 « negative » and 2 « positive ») with good internal consistency. The introduction of two positive factors (rewarding personal experiences, good aspects of the relationship with the patient) might be the basis of a usefull outcome measure for intervention aimed at promoting caregiver well-being. Nevertheless, the authors fail to develop an overall score that includes these factors, and focus on the negative dimensions as predictors of morbidity and well-being. None of the variables included in the regression model explain a significant percent of the variance of the ECI positive score. None of these instruments was employed for evaluating programs or treatments, even psychoeducational programs for caregivers. This may be partly due to the lack of data about sensitivity to change. No instrument is now available for evaluating therapeutics from the caregiver's point of view.","behavior disorder; caregiver; distress syndrome; family life; human; interview; leisure; prevalence; principal component analysis; psychometry; quality of life; questionnaire; review; schizophrenia; social behavior; symptom; Caregivers; Cost of Illness; Family Health; Humans; Questionnaires; Schizophrenia; Stress, Psychological"

These proteins are directed to the division site by the combination of two negative regulatory systems. Nucleoid occlusion is a poorly understood mechanism whereby the nucleoid prevents division in the cylindrical part of the cell, until chromosome segregation has occurred near midcell. The Min proteins prevent division in the nucleoid-free spaces near the cell poles in a manner that is beginning to be understood in cytological and biochemical terms. The hierarchy whereby the essential division proteins assemble at the midcell division site has been worked out for both E. coli and B. subtilis. They can be divided into essentially three classes depending on their position in the hierarchy and, to a certain extent, their subcellular localization. FtsZ is a cytosolic tubulin-like protein that polymerizes into an oligomeric structure that forms the initial ring at midcell. FtsA is another cytosolic protein that is related to actin, but its precise function is unclear. The cytoplasmic proteins are linked to the membrane by putative membrane anchor proteins, such as ZipA of E. coli and possibly EzrA of B. subtilis, which have a single membrane span but a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. The remaining proteins are either integral membrane proteins or transmembrane proteins with their major domains outside the cell. The functions of most of these proteins are unclear with the exception of at least one penicillin-binding protein, which catalyzes a key step in cell wall synthesis in the division septum.","bacterial protein; cell cycle protein; FtsZ protein; membrane protein; MinC protein; MinD protein; penicillin binding protein; peptidoglycan; protein FtsA; protein FtsI; protein FtsK; protein FtsL; protein FtsN; protein FtsQ; protein FtsW; protein MinE; protein ZipA; unclassified drug; anchorage independent growth; bacterial growth; bacterial membrane; bacterium; cell division; cellular distribution; cytokinesis; DNA replication; nonhuman; protein assembly; protein function; protein localization; protein polymerization; review; sporogenesis; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Carrier Proteins; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Division; Cell Membrane; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Escherichia coli Proteins; Hexosyltransferases; Membrane Proteins; Multienzyme Complexes; Muramoylpentapeptide Carboxypeptidase; Penicillin-Binding Proteins; Peptidoglycan; Peptidoglycan Glycosyltransferase; Peptidyl Transferases; Spores, Bacterial; Bacillus subtilis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli"

Peroxisomal β-oxidation system has been demonstrated to participate in the catabolism of intarcellular acyl compounds such as very long chain fatty acids, long chain dicarboxylic acids and bile acid precursors in addition to fatty acids. The difference of functions between mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation systems is mainly due to the difference of characteristics of enzymes participating in the β-oxidation in both organella.

This study was aimed at understanding the structural basis of their chain-breaking properties and at designing new compounds with improved antioxidative properties. For this, a series of 2-amino-1,4-pyrazine derivatives and their related imidazolopyrazinones were synthesised and examined for their capacity to inhibit lipid peroxidation in linoleate micelles subjected to the peroxidizing action of AAPH. Structure-activity relationship studies indicated that the reduction of the peroxidation rate by CLM is mainly determined by the concomitant presence of 5-p-hydroxyphenyl and 2-amino groups in para position. The lipophilic character of substituents also affected this effect. All imidazolopyrazinones induced a lag-time before the onset of the peroxidation process. The hetero-bicyclic imidazolopyrazinone moiety appears as the main contributor to this activity while phenol groups play little role in it. On the other hand, phenol groups were required for the reduction of the peroxidation rate after the lag-phase. The introduction of a supplementary p-hydroxyphenyl substituent at C8 position did not increase chain-breaking properties. The substitution of the C5-P-hydroxyphenyl with a catechol moiety or the introduction of a second amino group on the pyrazine ring yielded the most active compounds, superior to imidazolopyrazinones and reference antioxidants like epigallocatechin gallate, vitamin E and trolox. The strong antioxidant properties of 2,6-diaminopyrazines are not dependent on the presence of hydroxyl groups indicating that their reaction mechanism differs from that of 2-amino-1,4-pyrazine derivatives.","alpha tocopherol; aminopyrazine derivative; antioxidant; catechol; coelenteramine derivative; coelenterazine derivative; epigallocatechin gallate; imidazole derivative; imidazolopyrazinone derivative; linoleic acid; luciferin; phenol derivative; pyrazine derivative; trolox C; unclassified drug; antioxidant activity; bioluminescence; chemical reaction; chemical structure; controlled study; in vitro study; lipid peroxidation; lipophilicity; marine environment; micelle; review; structure activity relation; structure analysis; synthesis; Antioxidants; Imidazoles; Linoleic Acid; Lipid Peroxidation; Micelles; Models, Chemical; Oxygen; Pyrazines; Structure-Activity Relationship; Time Factors"

In this study, we characterize the expression of p75NTR in sensory neurones of the newborn rat DRG using immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we investigate the change in constitutive expression pattern of p75NTR in these neurones following axotomy. In the C7 and C8 DRG of the newborn rat, p75NTR is expressed in approximately 70% of DRG neurones. Those expressing p75NTR can be classified into subpopulations with moderate or intense p75NTR expression,each present in approximately equal proportions. Whilst p75NTR expression is observed in neurones throughout the entire neuronal diameter range, a correlation exists between neuronal diameter and p75NTR expression intensity.

The average caloric value of MCT is 8.25 kcal/g. MCT are quicker hydrolized compared to triglycerides consisting of long-chain fatty acids (LCT). Medium-chain fatty acids reach the liver, where most of the MCT is oxidized, via the portal vein. Acetyl-CoA produced by β-oxidation is further oxidized to CO2 and may be used for ketone body formation and de-novo synthesis of fatty acids. In the majority of studies, the β-hydroxybutyrate plasma level increased after intake of MCT. Some of the medium-chain fatty acids are subject to omega-oxidation from which dicarbonic acids result. Weight loss in persons on reduction diets is increased by exchange of LCT containing food by food containing MCT. This is due to the lower caloric value of MCT and higher energy losses, compared to LCT, by nutritional thermogenesis and/or a higher basal metabolism. If LCT are replaced by MCT, about 2 kcal/g fat are saved, provided the MCT are triglycerides with C8 and C10 fatty acids. In obese persons, oxidation of dietary long-chain, but not of medium-chain fatty acids, could be reduced. Some studies have shown MCT to enhance the feeling of satiation.

Similar in structure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), PBDEs resist degradation in the environment. Less brominated PBDEs like tetra-, penta- and hexa- demonstrate high affinity for lipids and can accumulate in the bodies of animals and humans. Breast milk from North American women contained much higher amounts of PBDEs than levels in breast milk from Swedish women, indicating that North American exposures to PBDEs may be particularly high. Evidence to date suggests that tetra- and penta-BDEs are likely to be the more toxic and bioaccumulative of the PBDE compounds, compared to octa- and deca-congeners. PBDEs are sold as mixtures, under names such as ""pentabromodiphenyl ether"" and ""octabromodiphenyl ether."" The pentabromo product is a mixture of tetra-BDEs and penta-BDEs in approximately equal amounts. Pentabromo consists of PBDEs that are believed to be the most toxic. This mixture has been banned by the European Union, but is still used in North America. The United States is the leading producer and user of pentabromo. In August 2003, the State of California passed a bill to phase out the use of penta- and octa-PBDE by 2008. The toxicology of PBDEs is not well understood, but PBDEs have been associated with tumors, neurodevelopmental toxicity and thyroid hormone imbalance. The neurotoxic effects of PBDEs are similar to those observed for PCBs. Children exposed to PBDEs are prone to subtle but measurable developmental problems. It is presumed that PBDEs are endocrine disruptors, but research in this area is scant. Further studies are imperative in a multitude of health and environmental disciplines to determine the adverse effects and mode of action of this widespread emerging pollutant on human health.","diphenyl ether derivative; pentabromodiphenyl ether; polybrominated biphenyl; animal; chemically induced disorder; chemistry; endocrine disease; human; pollutant; review; thyroid disease; Animals; Endocrine System Diseases; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Phenyl Ethers; Polybrominated Biphenyls; Thyroid Diseases"

This phenomenon is characterized by increases in the volume density and fatty acid oxidation of these organelles, which contain hydrogen peroxide and fatty acid oxidation systems important in lipid metabolism. Research showing that some peroxisome proliferating chemicals are nongenotoxic animal carcinogens stimulated interest in developing mode of action (MOA) information to understand and explain the human relevance of animal tumors associated with these chemicals. Studies have demonstrated that a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in energy homeostasis, designated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), is an obligatory factor in peroxisome proliferation in rodent hepatocytes. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the state of the science on several topics critical to evaluating the relationship between the MOA for PPARα agonists and the human relevance of related animal tumors. Topics include a review of existing tumor bioassay data, data from animal and human sources relating to the MOA for PPARα agonists in several different tissues, and case studies on the potential human relevance of the animal MOA data. The summary of existing bioassay data discloses substantial species differences in response to peroxisome proliferators in vivo, with rodents more responsive than primates. Among the rat and mouse strains tested, both males and females develop tumors in response to exposure to a wide range of chemicals including DEHP and other phthalates, chlorinated paraffins, chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene, and certain pesticides and hypolipidemic pharmaceuticals. MOA data from three different rodent tissues - rat and mouse liver, rat pancreas, and rat testis - lead to several different postulated MOAs, some beginning with PPARα activation as a causal first step. For example, studies in rodent liver identified seven ""key events,"" including three ""causal events"" - activation of PPARα, perturbation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, and selective clonal expansion - and a series of associative events involving peroxisome proliferation, hepatocyte oxidative stress, and Kupffer-cell-mediated events. Similar in-depth analysis for rat Leydig-cell tumors (LCTs) posits one MOA that begins with PPARα activation in the liver, but two possible pathways, one secondary to liver induction and the other direct inhibition of testicular testosterone biosynthesis. For this tumor, both proposed pathways involve changes in the metabolism and quantity of related hormones and hormone precursors. Key events in the postulated MOA for the third tumor type, pancreatic acinar-cell tumors (PACTs) in rats, also begin with PPARα activation in the liver, followed by changes in bile synthesis and composition. Using the new human relevance framework (HRF) (see companion article), case studies involving PPARα-related tumors in each of these three tissues produced a range of outcomes, depending partly on the quality and quantity of MOA data available from laboratory animals and related information from human data sources.","antilipemic agent; bezafibrate; chlorinated hydrocarbon; ciprofibrate; clobuzarit; clofibrate; fatty acid; fenofibrate; gemfibrozil; herbicide; hormone receptor; hydrogen peroxide; methylclofenapate; nafenopin; natural product; paraffin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha agonist; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; phthalic acid derivative; pirinixil; plasticizer; solvent; tetrachloroethylene; tiadenol; tomelukast; trichloroacetic acid; trichloroethylene; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; carcinogen; cell receptor; DNA binding protein; nuclear protein; repressor protein; transcription factor; zinc finger protein; acinar cell; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; bioassay; cancer risk; cell proliferation; chemical carcinogenesis; chlorination; clonogenesis; controlled study; density; drug carcinogenicity; drug mechanism; fatty acid oxidation; female; human; human relevance; Kupffer cell; Leydig cell tumor; lipid metabolism; liver; liver cell; male; metabolic regulation; mouse; nonhuman; outcomes research; oxidative stress; pancreas; peroxisome; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; quantitative diagnosis; rat; review; selective clonal expansion; species comparison; species difference; testis; testosterone synthesis; tissue distribution; animal; cell transformation; disease model; drug effect; Leydig cell tumor; lipid peroxidation; liver tumor; metabolism; methodology; microbody; oxidation reduction reaction; pancreas tumor; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; primate; risk assessment; testis tumor; Animalia; Primates; Rodentia; Animals; Biological Assay; Carcinogens; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Disease Models, Animal; DNA-Binding Proteins; Fatty Acids; Humans; Leydig Cell Tumor; Lipid Peroxidation; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Microbodies; Nuclear Proteins; Oxidation-Reduction; Pancreas; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Primates; Rats; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Repressor Proteins; Risk Assessment; Testicular Neoplasms; Testis; Transcription Factors; Zinc Fingers"

The full potential of the technique, however, is limited by the fact that growth of cells is usually restricted to a monolayer accompanied by major decreases in many of their tissue-specific functions. This has been shown to be due, in large part, to the inadequate oxygenation of cells growing in tissue culture dishes. Studies that show that the high charge density and rigidity of the plastic and glass surfaces used for culture are also major factors limiting growth of cells to a monolayer, are reviewed. A new culture system has been developed in which cells are grown on substrata made using perfluorocarbons (PFCs) coated with collagen type 1 and other adhesive factors. Perfluorocarbons have a much higher solubility for oxygen than water and have been used as oxygen delivery systems to protect cells from hypoxia. These new PFC-based substrata can provide both the optimal level of oxygen cells need to maintain differentiated functions and the flexible and weaker type of adhesion that allows cells to round up, interact with each other, and when provided with adequate nutritional support, to grow in three dimension.","1h,1h perfluoro 1 metadecanol; acetylcarnitine; adhesive agent; albumin; antioxidant; collagen type 1; cytochrome P450; decanol; epidermal growth factor; fibronectin; fluorocarbon; free radical; gelatin; growth factor; insulin; liothyronine; lipid; oxygen; perfluoro compound; perfluorotrihexylamine; politef; polyacrylamide gel; polystyrene; reactive oxygen metabolite; tyrosine; unclassified drug; water; aerobic metabolism; anchorage independent growth; biochemistry; biopsy; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell growth; cell hypoxia; cell proliferation; cell respiration; cell strain HepG2; gas permeability; HeLa cell; liver cell; mammal cell; nonhuman; nutritional support; oxygen tension; oxygenation; physiology; protein phosphorylation; protein synthesis; review; solubility; spheroid cell; tissue culture; tissue specificity; Mammalia"

PFOS was also found to exhibit both bioaccumulative and toxic properties. This review focuses on the analysis and occurrence of fluorinated alkyl substances that have been observed in the environment.

This is an attempt to improve the management of affected babies and stimulate more research concerning new diagnostic tools. Recent findings: Current trends in the field of (early) diagnosis, such as: (1) imaging techniques, e.g. contrast radiography, portal vein ultrasonography, magnetic resonance, radionuclide scanning; (2) gastrointestinal tonometry; (3) the detection of biochemical markers, cytokines, growth factors; and (4) the determination of the mean peak hydrogen: carbon dioxide ratio excreted in breath, are only some of those mentioned. Various novel preventive techniques are also presented, among which platelet-activating factor acetyl hydrolase activity enhancement, platelet-activating factor receptor antagonists and probiotics, such as Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus acidophilus, seem quite promising.

PFOA and its salts are commercially used in various industrial processes. The chemical is persistent in the environment and does not undergo biotransformation. It was reported that PFOA is found not only in the serum of occupationally exposed workers but also general populations. Recent studies have suggested that the biological half-life of PFOA in humans is 4.37 years based on study of occupationally exposed workers. It is increasingly suspect that PFOA accumulates and affects human health, although the toxicokinetics of PFOA in humans remain unclear. In experimental animals, PFOA seems low in toxicity. PFOA is well-absorbed following oral and inhalation exposure, and to a lesser extent following dermal exposure. Once absorbed in the body, it distributes predominantly to the liver and plasma, and to a lesser extent the kidney and lungs. PFOA is excreted in both urine and feces. Biological half-life of PFOA is quite different between species and sexes and the difference is due mainly to the difference in renal clearance. In rats, renal clearance of PFOA is regulated by sex hormones, especially testosterone. PFOA is excreted into urine by active tubular secretion, and certain organic anion transporters are thought to be responsible for the secretion. Fecal excretion is also important in the elimination of PFOA. There is evidence that PFOA undergoes enterohepatic circulation resulting in reduced amounts of fecal excretion. Elucidation of the mechanisms of transport in biological systems leads to elimination and detoxification of this chemical in the human body.","carrier protein; perfluorooctanoic acid; sex hormone; absorption; anion transport; drug distribution; enterohepatic circulation; half life time; human; kidney clearance; nonhuman; occupational exposure; occupational toxicology; review; sex difference; species difference; toxicokinetics; urinary excretion; Animalia"

Such claims have been underpinned by an impressive series of scientific advances that have resulted in the isolation of genes encoding most of the enzymes directly involved in oil biosynthesis. In some cases, these enzymes have even been re-engineered by site-directed or random mutagenesis to allow production of new fatty acid profiles that are not present in any existing organism. This has opened up the prospect of engineering 'designer oil crops' to produce novel fatty acids with chain lengths from C8 to C24 and with a wide range of industrially useful functionalities, including hydroxylation, epoxidation, and conjugated and non-conjugated double or triple bonds. However, there remain significant technical challenges before this promise of designer transgenic crops is likely to be translated into large-scale commercial reality. For example, it has proved surprisingly difficult to engineer high levels of novel fatty acids in genetically engineered transgenic plants, although many wild type seeds can readily accumulate 90-95% of a single fatty acid in their storage oil. Another complication is the recent discovery of multiple pathways of triacylglycerol biosynthesis and the difficulty in ensuring that novel fatty acids are only channelled towards storage triacylglycerols and not to membrane or signalling lipids in major target crops like rapeseed. New findings from our lab have suggested that there may also be problems with the tissue specificity of some of the 'seed-specific' gene promoters that are commonly used in transgenic crops. There are also considerable and often underestimated challenges associated with the economics, management and public acceptability of all transgenic crops, even for non-food use. In most cases the projections of petroleum reserves over the next few decades make it unlikely that crop-derived commodity products that substitute for petroleum will be competitive. Also the scale of crop production required to generate millions of tonnes of commodity oils, e.g., for biodegradable plastics, is likely to seriously impinge on food production at a time of increasing global populations, and is therefore unlikely to be acceptable. An alternative strategy to transgenic oil crops is to use molecular breeding techniques in order to develop new crops that already synthesise high levels of novel fatty acids of interest. Finally, the most promising market sectors and product ranges for the future development of oil crop biotechnology will be discussed. © 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","diacylglycerol; fatty acid; triacylglycerol; vegetable oil; enzyme engineering; epoxidation; fatty acid synthesis; food industry; gene expression; gene isolation; hydroxylation; nonhuman; oil industry; plant biotechnology; plant genetics; plant oil processing; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; review; site directed mutagenesis; tissue specificity; transgenic plant; Sinapis arvensis"

Six agents were reviewed: Teflon; autologous fat; collagen; silicone microparticles; silicone microballoons, and pyrolytic carbon. Collagen was the most frequently reported agent and yielded a 1-year cure/improvement rate of 60-80%, but results worsened significantly with longer follow-up. Teflon has been used longer in the treatment of stress incontinence, but low long- and short-term success rates and reported complications such as particle migration have prevented its widespread acceptance. Autologous fat has been suggested as a natural injectable but its success rate has been disappointing. The injection of silicone microparticles is associated with a long-term success rate of about 70% in patients with intrinsic sphincter deficiency, and it can now be injected more easily without the need of urethroscopy. Silicone microballoons and pyrolytic carbon has recently been introduced into clinical practice with a short-term success rate of about 70%, but longer follow-up is needed.

Using the concept of the retention-increment R′ which allows the distinction between non-enantioselective and enantioselective contributions to retention, concise thermodynamic parameters of enantioselectivity -ΔD,L(ΔG) are accessible. The enantiomerization of configurationally labile enantiomers can be investigated and quantified by complexation GC. Four distinct enantioselective processes and four different coalescence phenomena have been discerned in complexation GC. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","Coalescence; Derivatives; Enzymes; Gas chromatography; Nitrogen; Sulfur; Synthesis (chemical); Thermodynamics; Enantioselective complexation; Chromatographic analysis; bis[3 (perfluoroacyl)camphorate]; camphor derivative; cyclodextrin derivative; ketone derivative; metal; nitrogen; oxygen; pheromone; sulfur; unclassified drug; analytical error; asymmetric synthesis; chemical modification; chirality; complex formation; derivatization; enantiomer; enantioselectivity; enzyme mechanism; flavor; gas chromatography; intermethod comparison; kinetics; nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; quantitative analysis; racemic mixture; review; supercritical fluid chromatography; temperature dependence; theory; methodology; stereoisomerism; Chromatography, Gas; Stereoisomerism; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Stereoisomerism"

DEDTP dimerizes upon electrochemical oxidation at a glassy carbon electrode (GCE), but the current corresponding to this oxidation is rather small for analytical purpose. A Tosflex polymer film modified glassy carbon electrode (TFGCE) was fabricated to improve the detection of DEDTP. In a pH 5.5 solution, DEDTP deprotonated to DEDTP- anion which was accumulated onto TFGCE by the anion-exchange feature of Tosflex followed by square-wave voltammetric determination. With 3 min accumulation, the analytical signal versus concentration dependence was linear from 2 ppb (1.07 × 10-8 M) to 400 ppb (2.16 × 10-6 M) with a regression coefficient of 0.995 and a detection limit of 0.4 ppb (2.1 × 10-9 M). Unlike many other anion-exchange polymer modified electrodes, the TFGCE showed excellent stability over the studied pH range of 1-9.","carbon; phosphoric acid derivative; phosphorodithioic acid o,o diethyl ester; polymer; tosflex; unclassified drug; anion exchange; dimerization; electrochemical detection; film; molecular stability; oxidation; pH; potentiometry; regression analysis; review"

Because breath can be obtained non-invasively and its constituents directly reflect concentrations in the blood, its use has many potential applications in the field of biomarker research. This paper reviews the utility and application of the single breath canister (SBC) method of alveolar breath collection and analysis first developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in the 1990s. This review covers the development of the SBC technique in the laboratory and its application in a range of field studies. Together these studies specifically show how the SBC method (and exhaled breath analysis in general) can be used to clearly demonstrate recent exposure to volatile organic compounds, to link particular activities to specific exposures, to determine compound-specific uptake and elimination kinetics, and to assess the relative importance of various routes of exposure (i.e. dermal, ingestion, inhalation) in multipathway scenarios. Specific investigations covered in this overview include an assessment of exposures related to the residential use of contaminated groundwater, exposures to gasoline and fuel additives at self-service gas stations, swimmers' exposures to trihalomethanes, and occupational exposures to jet fuel.","biological marker; fuel; gasoline; trihalomethane; volatile organic compound; xenobiotic agent; biological marker; hydrocarbon; analytic method; analytical equipment; blood level; breath analysis; controlled study; environmental exposure; human; ingestion; inhalation; non invasive measurement; occupational exposure; review; single breath canister; skin absorption; technique; transport kinetics; water contamination; environmental monitoring; female; government; instrumentation; male; mass fragmentography; methodology; occupational exposure; United States; volatilization; water pollutant; Biological Markers; Breath Tests; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Human; Hydrocarbons; Male; Mass Fragmentography; Occupational Exposure; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Volatilization; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Biological Markers; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Humans; Male; Occupational Exposure; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Volatilization; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The PBDs exert their biological activity through covalent binding and exhibit cytotoxicity. Extensive studies have been carried out on the synthetic strategies of PBDs, and a sound understanding of structure activity relationships within this class of compounds has been developed. The PBDs have shown to interfere with the interaction of endonuclease enzymes of DNA and block the transcription by inhibiting RNA polymerase in a sequence specific manner. These processes have been thought to account for the biological activity of PBDs. The PBDs have also been used as a scaffold to attach different type of moieties leading to novel sequence selective DNA cleaving and cross-linking agents. The design and synthesis of C8-linked PBD dimers and other hybrids of PBDs has given a new insight towards the development of molecules with enhanced DNA binding affinity and sequence specificity compared to the naturally occurring PBDs. This improvement in the biological profile has been explained on the basis of certain factors like DNA cross-linking and doubling of DNA binding sites. There seems to be enough potential for further changing the substitution pattern and to design structurally modified PBDs by retaining the PBD core intact. In this review both the synthetic strategies and the structure-activity relationships, particularly the DNA binding and cytotoxicity studies of PBDs have been discussed.","1,2,3,11a tetrahydro 8 hydroxy 7 methoxy 5h pyrrolo[2,1 c][1,4]benzodiazepin 5 one; amide; amonafide; anthramycin; antineoplastic agent; antineoplastic antibiotic; benzodiazepine derivative; chicamycin a; cisplatin; dilactam; dimer; distamycin A derivative; DNA topoisomerase; double stranded DNA; dsb 120; endonuclease; gyrase inhibitor; imine; lexitropsin; methanolamine; mitonafide; neothramycin A; neothramycin B; oxazolo[2,3 c][1,4]benzodiazepine derivative; pyrrolo[2,1 c][1,4]benzodiazepine derivative; RNA polymerase; sibiromycin; sjg 136; tomaymycin; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; antineoplastic activity; binding affinity; binding site; controlled study; covalent bond; cytotoxicity; DNA cleavage; DNA cross linking; DNA sequence; DNA transcription; drug binding; drug design; drug DNA binding; drug inhibition; drug isolation; drug potency; drug synthesis; human; human cell; hybrid; review; sequence analysis; Streptomyces; structure activity relation; Animals; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Benzodiazepines; DNA, Neoplasm; Drug Design; Humans; Indicators and Reagents; Prodrugs; Pyrroles; Structure-Activity Relationship"

The EDX examination is probably the best procedure available by which to evaluate brachial plexus lesions. It provides localizing, pathologic, pathophysiologic, severity, and prognostic information. By localizing the lesion and identifying the underlying pathophysiology, it often predicts the underlying etiologic process; for example, (1) major T1 APR involvement with true neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome; (2) C8 APR involvement with postmedian sternotomy brachial plexopathies; (3) supraclavicular demyelinating conduction block with classic postoperative paralysis (often confined to the upper plexus); (4) widespread infraclavicular demyelinating conduction blocks with radiation plexopathy; (5) severe progressive axon loss with neoplastic processes; (6) motor NCS abnormalities exceeding sensory NCS abnormalities for the same peripheral nervous system segment with intraspinal canal lesions (eg, avulsions); (7) demyelinating conduction block with sparing of the pertinent sensory NCS study with multifocal motor neuropathy; and (8) lack of EDX abnormalities with hysteria, conversion reactions, and malingering, as well as with disputed neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. In addition, incorrect clinical considerations may be excluded (eg, when abnormal SNAPs are identified, an isolated radiculopathy is excluded). Among the various EDX study components, the sensory NCS are the most useful for brachial plexus element localization. One drawback of the sensory NCS for localization occurs in the setting of concomitant carpal tunnel syndrome; the latter negates the utility of the median sensory NCS for brachial plexus localization. The motor NCS and NEE often overcome this drawback and, regardless of sensory NCS findings, are always performed.","brachial plexus neuropathy; disease classification; electrodiagnosis; human; neuroanatomy; pathophysiology; priority journal; review; article; brachial plexus; differential diagnosis; electrodiagnosis; electromyography; methodology; motoneuron; physiology; sensitivity and specificity; sensory receptor; Brachial Plexus; Brachial Plexus Neuropathies; Diagnosis, Differential; Electrodiagnosis; Electromyography; Human; Motor Neurons; Receptors, Sensory; Sensitivity and Specificity; Brachial Plexus; Diagnosis, Differential; Humans; Motor Neurons; Receptors, Sensory; Sensitivity and Specificity"

The literature on the study of functional activation of PPARalpha by environmental chemicals in relation to their toxicities were reviewed. Environmental chemicals that were found to induce peroxisomes (peroxisome proliferators) and to activate the function of PPARalpha included plasticizers, herbicides, and organic solvents that have carboxyl groups in their parent substances or their metabolites. Several studies have showed species differences in the constitutive expression of PPARalpha and activation of PPARalpha, which may result in species differences in the induction of transcription of the genes encoding several peroxisomal enzymes. Although much information has supported the view that PPARalpha is primarily involved in the hepatic carcinogenicity of peroxisome proliferators, conflicting evidence exists. Most of the peroxisome proliferators have been shown to induce reproductive and developmental disorders, which might, in part. be associated with the functional activation of PPARalpha. Few epidemiological studies on the effect of peroxisome proliferators on humans have been conducted. The effect of perfluorooctanoic acid on humans was evaluated from the aspect of lipid metabolism in one study, which concluded that there was no effect.","carcinogen; cell receptor; herbicide; ligand; plasticizer; solvent; transcription factor; animal; drug effect; female; genetics; human; male; metabolism; mouse; pollutant; rat; review; transactivation; Animals; Carcinogens, Environmental; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Herbicides; Humans; Ligands; Male; Mice; Plasticizers; Rats; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Solvents; Trans-Activation (Genetics); Transcription Factors"

DATA SOURCES: Review articles, original reports and abstracts pertaining to endoscopic injection therapy were obtained through a PubMed search of English, German and French publications from 1981 to 2001. DATA SELECTION: A total of 46 studies were selected. Four were selected to support basic concepts in the management of vesicoureteric reflux, and the remainder pertained specifically to endoscopic injection therapy for vesicoureteric reflux. DATA EXTRACTION: The reports were analyzed with focus on the physical properties of the biomaterial injected, results of treatment in regard to the cure of vesicoureteric reflux, duration of cure, and possible adverse effects and clinical benefits engendered by the use of injectable materials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Endoscopic injection therapy successfully cures vesicoureteric reflux in 60% to 80% of cases. Success rates are higher with particulate materials (Teflon and Macroplastique) than with bovine collagen or autologous chondrocytes. Long term data regarding cure are scant. Although concerns about particulate migration and autoimmune disease exist, these have not been borne out of clinical experience. Endoscopic injection may be accomplished on an outpatient basis, with less morbidity than with open ureteroneocystostomy. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic injection therapy should be offered as an alternative treatment in patients with indications to consider ureteroneocystotomy, but should not change the indications for surgical intervention. The ideal biomaterial for injection has yet to be developed, but the field of autologous tissue engineering holds promise for future development.","biomaterial; collagen; collagen implant; politef; autoimmune disease; cartilage cell; child; device; endoscopy; human; morbidity; review; risk benefit analysis; tissue engineering; treatment indication; treatment outcome; ureteroneocystostomy; vesicoureteral reflux"

The Cochrane Library, Medline, Pre-Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Amed and Cancerlit were searched for relevant studies. Controlled trials comparing non-metal cannulae with metal butterfly needles for giving subcutaneous infusion to palliative care patients were included. The outcome considered was site duration in terms of hours of patency or until change was required. Four trials met the inclusion criteria although overall quality was poor due to low follow-up. Studies examined either Teflon or Vialon-coated catheters. All studies showed non-metal cannulae to be superior to metal. In individual studies estimates in mean increase in duration of the site range from 21 to 159 hours. It seems that non-metal cannulae are more effective in maintaining the duration of subcutaneous infusion sites than butterfly needles. Both types of non-metal catheter showed clear benefits. This review has not examined other outcomes but in general adverse effects lead to the removal of the catheter and so would be reflected in the outcome of considered. Although historically non-metal cannulae have been considerably more expensive there is now little difference between metal and Teflon-coated catheters. This review recommends the use of non-metal cannulae in preference to butterfly needles.","metal; politef; polyurethan; clinical trial; comparative study; human; infusion; instrumentation; needle; palliative therapy; review; subcutaneous drug administration; Clinical Trials; Humans; Infusions, Parenteral; Injections, Subcutaneous; Metals; Needles; Palliative Care; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Polyurethanes"

Moreover, a lower sulphur content of fuels would allow the use of new engines and catalytic systems for the reduction of CO, particle and NOx-emissions, and a more efficient fuel consumption. The S-level in fuels is presently limited in Germany for gasoline and diesel oil to 150 ppm and 350 ppm, respectively. In 2005, the level will be decreased Europe-wide for all vehicle-fuels down to 50 ppm; in some countries, fuels are or will be on the market with even less sulphur. The current technology of hydrodesulphurization (heterogeneous, catalyzed hydrotreating of organic sulphur compounds) can desulphurize quite adequately down to today's S-level. The process, however, is limited for the production of ultra-low sulphur fuels, and the expenses (pressure, reactor size, investment costs, energy consumption, specific active catalysts) are high to meet future requirements. Alternative processes, which are not limited to hydrotreating, are therefore desirable. Beside an overview about hydrotreating, this paper presents two quite different alternatives: Extraction of sulphur compounds by ionic liquids and the synthetic production of S-free fuels from natural gas by Fischer-Tropsch-synthesis. Ionic liquids (ILs) are low melting (<100°C) salts which represent a new class of non-molecular, ionic solvents. In the experiments presented, extraction of model diesel oils (dibenzothiophene and dodecanthiol in n-dodecane) as well as of a real predesulphurized diesel oil (with about 400 ppm S) were investigated. The results show the excellent and selective extraction properties of ILs for organic sulphur compounds, especially with regard to those compounds which are very difficult to remove by common hydrodesulphurization. As expected, the desulphurization by extraction is much more complicated in case of real diesel oil (compared to a model oil) due to its complex chemical composition including many different sulphur compounds and other impurities like organic nitrogen and metal-compounds. Nevertheless, the results with pre-desulphurized diesel oil are also very promising. So, extraction of sulphur components by ILs is a new approach for deep desulphurization of diesel oil. The application of very mild process conditions (low pressure and temperature) in comparison to traditional hydrotreating is an additional advantage of this new concept. An alternative to today's fuels based on crude oil is the production of gasoline and diesel oil from natural gas (or other fossil fuels like coal) by Fischer-Tropsch-synthesis (FTS). The products like diesel oil are completely free of sulphur and other impurities like nitrogen and metal compounds. Although several FTS- processes have been investigated and developed, and some processes are already running on a technical scale, a real breakthrough was not obtained up to now. The production costs of these capital-intensive processes are probably above the breakeven point, at least at today's oil price. In this paper, a 'low-cost' process is discussed, which is based on nitrogen-rich syngas. In contrast to classical FTS-processes with nitrogen-free syngas, the investment costs are probably lower: The syngas is produced by partial oxidation with air, which eliminates the need of an air separation plant, while a process with nitrogen-rich syngas does not utilize a recycle loop and a recycle compressor.","diesel fuel; fuel; gasoline; sulfur; air pollution; desulfurization; environmental protection; exhaust gas; oil industry; petrochemical industry; reaction analysis; review"

The advantage of magnetic storage is that the storage density is increasing at a very rapid rate. Recently, with the introduction of thin film media and a magneto-resistive head, the storage densities are increasing at a rate of 100% per year, the storage density in hard disks reached 50 M bit/mm2 for production and 300 M bit/mm2 for demonstration. Diamond-like carbon (DLC) is applied over a Co-based magnetic layer as a smooth protective layer, and one to two monolayers of perfluoropolyether are used as a lubricant. The tribological properties of ultra-thin films have attracted considerable attention, because they can dramatically influence the tribological properties of recording media, which limits the storage density before we achieve the magnetic limit. The rapidly increasing storage density will soon require carbon overcoats of only 2 nm and a lubricant of less than 1 nm to achieve the above-mentioned recording density. Not only the film properties, but also the surface interaction have become a matter of importance in this region. In order to ensure the tribological properties and lifetime of the magnetic recording system, the lubricant molecule must be strongly attached to the carbon surface so that they can avoid spin-off from the rapidly rotating disks, depletion caused by head-media interactions, or simple displacement by adsorbed water or airborne organic compounds. Also, a strongly adsorbed lubricant leads to low friction and improve durability. This paper reviews conventional methods used to characterize these films and the interaction between carbon and the lubricant molecules. The prospect for the analysis of ultra-thin film from the standpoints of XPS, FTIR, Raman, EELS, Auger is also given.","carbon; lubricating agent; perfluoropolyether; polyether derivative; unclassified drug; adsorption; chemical interaction; density; economic aspect; film; magnetism; medical technology; Raman spectrometry; recording; review; rotation; surface property; water absorption; X ray analysis; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy"

But when using our novel method, in the case of only increasing less computing amounts (&lt;1%), we can obtain conveniently the first order approximation, second order approximation, and so on.

Despite this there has been a continued and expanding use of polyclonal anti-T cell globulins in the management of cardiac, lung and renal transplants in many centres. As with all immunosuppressive drugs over and under-immunosuppression remains a major problem. A number of different methods have been described for monitoring anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) therapy in transplant patients. These include: monitoring serum IgG levels, the E- rosette assay; flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies. The measurement of serum IgG levels of the host animal (rabbit or horse) has been shown not to correlate with the presence of acute rejection episodes. The E-rosette assay has been found to be extremely time consuming and unreliable. With flow cytometric techniques, monoclonal antibodies directed against the T lymphocytes have been used to monitor ATG therapy and this has allowed the adjustment of the ATG administered to each individual patient. In patients receiving, renal, cardiac, lung or heart lung transplants we have developed flow cytometric assays to monitor ATG therapy on a daily basis with adjustment of the dosage of ATG administered according to this result. We have progressed from a dual platform assay where the T-cell percent from flow cytometry is combined with the lymphocyte count determined from a Haematology Cell Analyser to a single platform flow cytometric assay using commercially available polyfluorescent beads of two different types. An increasing problem with transplant patients is that ATG once given may induce antibodies against the heterologous rabbit or horse IgG. With time, a number of renal, cardiac and lung transplant patients have lost their grafts and are retransplanted. A similar situation is seen in patients who are given regular ATG therapy for the treatment of aplastic anemia. We have developed a flow cytometric duplex assay for the detection of such antibodies. This has allowed us to screen the sera of transplant patients for the presence of such antibodies before therapy is given and to suggest for that patient the most appropriate ATG to be used.

A product that can be used in the pre-hospital setting that adequately carries and delivers oxygen to peripheral tissues would potentially be life saving for severely injured patients. Allogeneic blood is not the ideal agent in the pre-hospital setting. Present limitations in the allogeneic blood supply include the need for cross-matching, refrigeration, marginal supply, transfusion reactions, infectious disease transmission and immunomodulation increasing the risk of organ dysfunction after transfusion. Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers have been under present development for the last 25 years. These compounds use either human or bovine hemoglobin that is then chemically altered to improve safety. These compounds exhibit many desirable characteristics that make them potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of the injured patient. These compounds do not need to be cross-matched, have favorable oxygen dissociation characteristics, long half lives, do not transmit disease, appear to be less immunoreactive than blood and theoretically can be used in the pre-hospital setting as a low volume oxygen carrying solution without need for refrigeration. There are at least three agents presently under development that use different techniques to alter the basic hemoglobin tetramer. While there is no FDA approved hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier approved for use in injured patients at this writing, phase III studies are currently either underway or being developed. There is high likelihood that one or more of these agents will be approved for clinical use in the near future. © 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","apo 144; diaspirin crosslinked hemoglobin; fluorocarbon; hemoglobin; hemoglobin derivative; perfluorooctyl bromide; polymerized hemoglobin; recombinant hemoglobin; somatagen; stroma free hemoglobin; unclassified drug; blood storage; blood transfusion; blood transfusion reaction; clinical trial; disease transmission; drug approval; drug half life; drug safety; food and drug administration; gastrointestinal symptom; human; immunomodulation; immunoreactivity; injury scale; oxygen dissociation curve; oxygen transport; review; traumatology; Aspirin; Blood Substitutes; Blood Transfusion; Clinical Trials; Fluorocarbons; Hemoglobins; Humans; Oxygen; Raffinose; Wounds and Injuries"

Such drug delivery systems differ from conventional drug dosage forms (pills, tablets, ointments, creams, injectables and 'tiny time capsules') in that a localised depot of drug provides patterned release of the active agent with a pre-determined time course. The pattern of drug release may be constant, oscillating, declining continuously, or even pulsatile. The need to engineer different release patterns for drugs of different molecular sizes, potency, stability and hydrophobicity provides the impetus for active study of the design of new biomaterials, intelligent delivery systems and approaches for delivery through different portals in the body. The field of controlled drug delivery provides a driving force for current innovations in biomaterials. For most drug delivery systems, polymers function simply as inert, biocompatible carriers. In other systems, polymers can be designed with targeting or pathology-responsive functions. This review summarises some of the recently developed intellectual property in the field of biomaterials applied to drug delivery systems.

Such non-IgE-mediated ""pseudoallergic"" reactions are primarily caused by (1) certain liposomal formulations of intravenous drugs and imaging agents, (2) infusion liquids containing micelle-forming amphiphilic lipids or synthetic block-copolymer emulsifiers, and (3) iodinated radiocontrast media with limited solubility in water. Common features of the latter ""pseudoallergens"" include the capacity to activate the complement (C) system; also, the symptoms they cause are often typical manifestations of excessive anaphylatoxin generation in blood. Hence, these reactions have been called ""C activation-related pseudoallergy"" (CARPA). The present review surveys the experimental and clinical evidence for the involvement of C activation in HSRs caused by pseudoallergens in the above three categories. To fit CARPA within the classical scheme of HSRs, a subdivision of Type I allergy is proposed on the basis of the mechanism of mast cell (and basophil) activation. The new scheme distinguishes direct and receptor- mediated HSRs, with the latter category subdivided to true IgE-mediated allergy; anaphylatoxin- mediated CARPA; and IgE plus anaphylatoxin double-triggered reactions.

Five agents were reviewed: collagen, Teflon, autologous fat, silicone microparticles, and silicone microballoons. Collagen was the most frequently reported agent and yielded short-term cure and improved rates of 74%-100%. This deteriorated to approximately 57% with longer term follow-up. Teflon has similarly lower longer term than short-term success rates, at 33%-76%. The reported local complications and the potential for particle migration have resulted in its lack of widespread acceptance. Autologous fat has yielded the lowest success rate. Longer term success in a small number of silicone microparticle articles was similar to the other injectables at approximately 60%. Early success with silicone microballoons was 70%. The technique is generally free of major morbidity. The indication for injectables is intrinsic sphincter deficiency but hypermobility is not a contraindication. Long-term durability, cost effectiveness, and some safety issues still have to be addressed by further clinical trials.","biomaterial; collagen; collagen gel; drug derivative; GAX-collagen; politef; silastic; adipose tissue; female; human; injection; methodology; patient selection; prostheses and orthoses; review; stress incontinence; transplantation; Adipose Tissue; Biocompatible Materials; Collagen; Female; Humans; Injections; Patient Selection; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Prostheses and Implants; Silicone Elastomers; Urinary Incontinence, Stress"

The skin coverage is usually adequate but the aponeurotic defect has to be closed temporally using synthetic patches. The use of these materials leads to increase complication such as infection, fistula formation and extrusion. In addition a second operation is required to remove the material and to perform a definitive closure. The role of fascia lata in reconstruction of abdominal wall is well established as free grafts, pedicled flaps or free flaps. Bank cadaveric fascia lata is used extensively in neurosurgical, ophtalmological, orthopaedic and urogynecological procedures. This is the first description of the use of cadaveric fascia lata for the closure of large abdominal wall defects. CASE REPORTS: We present two cases of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The first patient was a newborn who presented the impossibility to close the fascia, that was salvaged by a teflón patch. Five months later the wound opened, leaving the mesh exposed that had to be removed. A cadaveric fascia lata patch was used to cover the defect, closing the skin satisfactorily. The second case was a two days newborn. We performed the diaphragmatic closure, and the aponeurotic defect was closed using cadaveric fascia lata. RESULTS: Cosmetic and functional appearance are satisfactory in both cases and no complications have been seen. CONCLUSION: Fascia lata patches are revascularized in the abdominal wall and incorporates into receptor tissue. They have the following advantages with respect to synthetic materials: First, the risk of complications is lower. Second, their removal is not necessary. Finally, no intraperitoneal adhesions occur. The risks of disease transmission and rejection are minimized by the Centro Comunitario de Transfusiones donor selection and processing of the cadaveric fascia lata.","abdominal wall musculature; cadaver; case report; fascia lata; human; male; newborn; review; transplantation; Abdominal Muscles; Cadaver; Fascia Lata; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male"

The HPTLC-CAMAG® consists of: 1) an HPTLC-Vario® development chamber for optimization of the mobile phases; 2) TLC Sampler III® automated sample applicators; 3) solid teflon migration chambers, i.e., horizontal tanks that enable separation to be carried out either in sandwich or in saturation mode; 4) a TLC Scanner 3® densitometer controlled by CATS 4® software; and 5) a Pentium MMX 233 MHz personal computer with an external backup unit. HPTLC quantitative and qualitative analysis has now reached a remarkably high level of development and performance. The samples (aqueous or non-aqueous solutions) that are to be processed are automatically applied by spraying (50-300 nl) in calibrated bands of a few mm (with up to 64 3-mm bands per 10 × 20 cm plate) on high-performance stationary phases and of wide technological diversity. The chromatogram is obtained in 10 min. and run over a migration pathway of 5-6 cm. The plates are read by absorption-reflection or fluorescence-reflection at an ad hoc wavelength (190-800 nm), then the peak areas which have been scanned are calculated by the trapezoid method. The calibration curves are generated by Michaelis-Menten non-linear regression, and validated by internal quality control. The analytical yield is high, i.e., up to 50 assays and 250 determinations per day. HPTLC analysis covers a wide functional range, and can be used in the following ways: 1) as a teaching tool for separative analysis and GLP; 2) it is an invaluable method for the optimization of mobile phases and for the determination of absorption spectra and absorption maxima, with a view to developing HPLC methods in complex matrices; 3) it provides major support for post-production quality control of prescribed hospital preparations of all types, e.g., those connected with parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy, synthetic narcotic analgesia; and it can also be used for dry dosage analysis; 4) it is useful in pharmaceutical assessment, e.g., in studies on the physico-chemical characteristics of various substances, such as their identity, purity, concentration, stability and compatibility, particularly with regard to generic products; 5) it can contribute to monitoring the safety of medical apparatus and equipment via the analysis of container-content interactions; 6) it provides a qualification system for personnel and procedures for within- and between-center validation of GMP. Setting up such an HPTLC quality control unit requires a basic investment of about 0.9 MF or 70,000 US dollars for a cost of no more than 10 F or 1.5 US dollars (including tax) per routine assay. After 18 months in operation and 16 500 assays, the HPTLC analysis unit has become one of the mainstays of the Gustave-Roussy QAP. © 2001 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.","densitometry; device; France; high performance thin layer chromatography; hospital pharmacy; Michaelis constant; nonlinear system; parenteral nutrition; quality control; review; spectral sensitivity; technology; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Chromatography, Thin Layer; Pharmacy Service, Hospital; Quality Control; Technology, Pharmaceutical"

The mesothelium plays a central role in the debate on this subject. The interaction between endometrium and peritoneum has been studied in an in-vitro model using amnion, peritoneum and mesothelial cells in culture on the one hand and cyclic and menstrual endometrium on the other hand.

Some novel amine-boranes R(CF3)2B·NHMe2 with R = CF3, C2F5, C4F9, C6F5, F2C=CF, CF3-FC=CF that are precursor molecules for the borates are reported; cleavage of their BN bond by NEt3 × 3HF furnishes fluoroborates [R(CF3)2BF]-. Cyanomethylborates [R(CF3)2BCH2CN]- with R = t-Bu, C6H5, F2C=CF, CH2CN result from reaction of NCCH2(CF3)2B·NMe3 with RLi. The well-known aminoborate [(CF3)3BNH2]- reacts with OCl- and OBr- to yield N,N-dihalogenoaminoborates [(CF3)3BNX2]- (X = Cl and Br), which can be fluorinated to form the N,N-difluoroborate anion [(CF3)3BNF2]-. Condensation of [(CF3)3BNH2]- with ONRf yields diazenidoborates [(CF3)3BN=NRf]-. The fluoroborate [(CF3)3BF]- is obtained by fluorination of [(CF3)3BNF2]- or by pyrolysis of [(CF3)3BN=NRf]-, whereas [(CF3)3BX]- (X = Cl and Br) are formed when dihalogenoaminoborates [(CF3)3BNX2]- are pyrolyzed. Nitroborates [Rf(CF3)2BNO2]- and [(C2F5)3BNO2]- are accessible by ozone oxidation of the corresponding dimethylamine-boranes. Anodic oxidation of [(CF3)3BNH2]- furnishes [(CF3)3BNO2]- and azodioxy-[(CF3)3BN(O)=N(O)B(CF3) 3]2- and azoxy-bis-tris(trinuoromethyl)borate [(CF3)3BN=N(O)B(CF3)3]2- dianions. The BN bonds of [(CF3)3BN(O)=N(O)B(CF3)3] 2-, [(CF3)3BN=NCF3]-, and [(CF3)3BNO2]- are hydrolyzed to yield the hydroxyborate [(CF3)3BOH]-.

In all cases of acute respiratory failure, there is a shortage of surfactant at the alveolar level. This deficit of surfactant leads to an increase in alveolar surface tension that increases the retraction forces of the lung, leading to end-expiratory alveolar collapse, finally resulting in respiratory dysfunction, which includes hypoxemia, low lung compliance, increase of intrapulmonary shunts, low functional residual capacity, atelectasis, and pulmonary edema. The goal of the treatment and prevention of acute respiratory failure is therefore based on the following three main items: re-opening the collapsed alveolar units; preserving the active surfactant component in the remaining functional alveolar units, and preventing end-expiratory collapse. The following strategies can be used to prevent and/or treat acute respiratory failure: counterbalancing the retraction forces of the lung by applying sufficiently high external pressures; and/or decreasing the surface tension at the air-liquid interface by means of exogenous surfactant, and/or eliminating the air-liquid interface by filling the lung with perfluorocarbons. By applying these therapeutic strategies in routine clinical practice, we should achieve a reduction in the mortality rate of patients suffering from acute respiratory failure.

Furthermore, inhibition of complement activation or depletion of complement components prior to myocardial reperfusion has been shown to reduce complement-mediated tissue injury in numerous animal models. IHD remains a leading cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Considerable effort in recent years has therefore been directed by biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries towards the development of novel, human complement inhibitors.

Interestingly, all three are encoded from the q32-34 region of human chromosome 9, together with at least four other lipocalins (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, complement factor γ-subunit, tear prealbumin, and prostaglandin D synthase) that also may have anti-inflammatory and/or antimicrobial activity. This review addresses important features of this genetically linked subfamily of lipocalins (involvement with the acute phase response, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, the tissue localization, complex formation with other proteins and receptors, etc.). It is likely that these proteins have evolved to be an integrated part of the body's defense system as part of the extended cytokine network. Its members exert a regulatory, dampening influence on the inflammatory cascade, thereby protecting against tissue damage from excessive inflammation. That most major mammalian allergens are lipocalins may reflect this connection of lipocalins with the immune system. We propose that this immunologically active lipocalin subset be named the 'immunocalins', signifying not only the structural homology and close genetic linkage of its members, but also their protective involvement with immunological and inflammatory processes. As immune mediators, immunocalins appear to use at least three interactive sites: the lipocalin 'pocket', binding sites for other plasma proteins, and binding sites for cell surface receptors.

These subunits are arranged asymmetrically to form a disulfide-linked C8α-γ dimer that is noncovalently associated with C8β. C8α and C8β are homologous to C6, C7 and C9 and together these proteins comprise what is referred to as the 'MAC protein family'. By comparison, C8γ is distinct in that it belongs to the lipocalin family of small, secreted proteins which have the common ability to bind small hydrophobic ligands.

Recent technical and conceptual breakthroughs in bacterial cell biology, combined with the flood of genome sequence information and the excellent genetic tools in several model systems, have shed new light on the mechanism of prokaryotic cell division. There is good evidence that in most species, a molecular machine, organized by the tubulin-like FtsZ protein, assembles at the site of division and orchestrates the splitting of the cell. The determinants that target the machine to the right place at the right time are beginning to be understood in the model systems, but it is still a mystery how the machine actually generates the constrictive force necessary for cytokinesis. Moreover, although some cell division determinants such as FtsZ are present in a broad spectrum of prokaryotic species, the lack of FtsZ in some species and different profiles of cell division proteins in different families suggests that there are diverse mechanisms for regulating cell division.

Magnetic resonance methods based on the paramagnetism of oxygen have the advantage of using great electromagnetic wavelengths, which present an important penetration in aqueous samples, and display no scattering in condensed matter. The transverse relaxation time (T2) of water protons is decreased by the paramagnetism of deoxyhaemoglobin, wich is inversely related to the blood oxygen concentration. A tremendous amount of work is currently being done using this blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) effect. The exchangeable imidazole proton of the proximal histidine of haemoglobin yields a more specific signal, which is directly related to the paramagnetism of deoxyhaemoglobin and reflects the oxygen concentration more accurately than the T2 of water protons. Perfluorocarbon emulsions are blood substitutes which can be used to measure precisely the oxygen content of blood. Unpaired electrons of the free radical probes can also be used for sensitive oxymetry purposes thanks to bimolecular collisions between the oxygen and free radical molecules, which alter, specifically, the electron paramagnetic resonance of the radical. Dynamic nuclear polarisation, which combines the sensitivity to oxygen of EPR and the tractability of NMR imaging, is a potential means of achieving localised oxymetry. The principles and recent applications of these magnetic resonance methods to the measurement of oxygen concentrations in biology are reviewed here, in order to underline the advantages and difficulties of each method. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In addition to this common ground, each specialty has its own particular aspects; the historical development of these are presented here with respect to otorhinolaryngology. Intravenous injections: The first experiments with intravenous injections were carried out in 1642 by a gentleman's hunting servant in eastern Germany. Similar experiments were done in 1656 by Christopher Wren, the astronomer, mathematician, and architect in Oxford, England, and a group of scientists around the physicist Robert Boyle. These experiments were prompted by new knowledge about blood circulation provided by William Harvey in 1628. The first books on the applications of intravenous infusions in humans were published in Germany by Major 1664 (Chirurgia Infusoria) and Elsholtz 1667 (Clysmatica Nova). Bladders of animals or enema syringes were used as instruments. Because of lethal accidents the infusions soon fell from favour. Kohler in Germany in 1776 eliminated a large bolus impacted in a patient's esophagus by an intravenous infusion of tartar emetic thus inducing violent vomiting. After this crucial experiment, foreign bodies in the esophagus were the most important indication for applying intravenous injections until Killian introduced extraction by esophagoscopy in 1990. Calibrated syringes after Pravaz: The French surgeon C. Pravaz in Lyon in 1853 invented a small syringe, the piston of which could be driven by a screw thus allowing exact dosage. A sharp needle with a pointed trocar could be introduced into the vessel making a dissection unnessessary. Pravazused his syringe for obliteration of arterial aneurysms by injection of ferric sesquichlorate. Pravaz's syringe initiated the invention of a great number of various calibrated syringes made of glass or metal combined with glass. Subcutaneous Injection and local anaesthesia: The calibrated syringes were commonly used in the treatment of syphilis by mercurialization. In otorhinolaryngology, they had and still have their primary application in local anaesthesia, which was introduced by Carl Ludwig Schleich in Berlin in 1892. Paraffin-injections: Around 1900 the injection of liquid paraffin for closing defects in subcutaneous tissues came into use (Gersuny in Vienna, Delangre in Tournai). This technique was immediately applied to rhinological indications such as a saddle nose (Stein 1901). This gave rise to the invention of special syringes and modifications of paraffin with different hardnesses and melting points. Around the middle of this century, paraffin was abandoned for this application because of serious complications, and new substances were introduced such like teflon, silicone and collagen. The historical development of these techniques of injections is described in details with many literature citations and figures.","paraffin; esophagoscopy; foreign body; Germany; history of medicine; infusion; injection; local anesthesia; otorhinolaryngology; priority journal; review; subcutaneous drug administration; syringe; vomiting; Anesthesia, Local; England; Germany; History, 17th Century; History, 18th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Injections; Injections, Intravenous; Injections, Subcutaneous; Medical Illustration; Museums; Otolaryngology; Paraffin; Syringes"

Many recall the famous experiments from Clark et al. in 1966 when he demonstrated 'liquidventilation with Perfluorocarbons' in the mammal species for the first time. After this hallmark, perfluorocarbons were subsequently introduced in research of acute lung injury by the techniques of Total- and Partial-Liquid- Ventilation (TLV; PLV). Perfluorocarbons (saturated organofluorids) have unique chemical and physical properties which made them attractive substances for intraalveolar application. The strong C-F bindings in the perfluorocarbon molecules are responsible for their chemical stability, biochemical inertness, high capacity to dissolve respiratory gases, low surface tension and high vapor pressures. Furthermore, the high density of the PFC lead to radio-opacity and their distribution to dependent lung areas. The efficacy of PFC liquid, applied by TLV/PLV has been demonstrated in numerous animal studies using different models of acute lung injury. Currently, several mechanisms of action of perfluorocarbon fluids in acute lung injury are discussed: recruitment of atelectatic alveoli, prevention of endexpiratory collapse of alveoli ('liquid PEEP'), redistribution of perfusion, oxygen transport, surfactant like effects and decrease of inflammation. Since total liquid ventilation has been used only in experimental models of lung injury, partial liquid ventilation has been introduced successfully into clinical trials (phase I-II). However, the results of the first randomised, controlled study of PLV in 90 adult patients suffering from severe respiratory failure (ALI/ARDS) showed no differences between PLV and conventional treatment. Furthermore, the instillation of relatively large amounts of liquid into the lungs poses several technical challenges and may be associated with complications such as liquithoraces, pneumothoraces and hypoxia. Since mammal lungs are evolutionary specialised to gas exchange using atmospheric oxygen, the application of liquids, even if they transport respiratory gases very well is not physiologic. To overcome these unwanted side effects, we developed a technique of perfluorocarbon vaporisation in analogy to the application of inhalation anaesthetic agents. After resolving some technical issues, this application technique was used successfully in an animal model of acute lung injury. Vaporisation of perfluorohexane in a concentration of 18 Vol.% of inspired gas improved significantly oxygenation and lung compliance. Though these results are promising, mechanisms of action, dose- efficacy relation, surfactant-perfluorocarbon interaction or anti- inflammatory effects of vaporised perfluorohexane are still unclear. These questions need to be clarified before this technique can be applied clinically. However, the inhalation of vapor, a technique already familiar to anaesthesiologists should avoid risks of large amounts of fluids in the bronchoalveolar space. Furthermore, this technique can be administered by established anaesthetic equipment with the advantage of exact dosing, continuous monitoring, and demand application in a way near to clinical routine.","fluorocarbon; hexane; isoflurane; fluorocarbon; inhalation anesthetic agent; isoflurane; perflexane; adult respiratory distress syndrome; drug efficacy; gas exchange; human; hypoxia; lung alveolus macrophage; lung collapse; lung injury; oxygen transport; review; surface tension; vaporization; adult respiratory distress syndrome; artificial ventilation; Anesthetics, Inhalation; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Isoflurane; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult"

Modern perfluorochemicals and cell-free hemoglobin solutions can be applied without prior cross-matching and are now available as stable formulations with long shelf life. Both groups of oxygen carriers have shown their effectivity and tolerability in numerous animal studies. An emulsion of perflubron which has a 60% weight/volume relation is actually undergoing phase III studies with respect to its effectivity in augmented acute normovolemic hemodilution since it has been shown to reverse hemodynamic transfusion triggers. While clinical studies with human cross-linked hemoglobin (DCLHb) have been stopped last year because of the results of two clinical trials showing an increased mortality in patients with stroke and multiple injury shock being treated with DCLHb in comparison with saline, a phase III study with polymerized bovine hemoglobin HBOC-201 is actually being performed in noncardiac patients with perioperative bleeding. The objective of this multicenter study is to show that treatment with HBOC-201 can reduce or avoid allogeneic RBC transfusion. Besides its use in clinical transfusion protocols, artificial oxygen carriers have a unique potential to deliver oxygen to the tissues by plasmatic transport due to its different physiology of oxygenation when compared with conventional oxygenation provided by red blood cells. Future studies must show if these modern oxygen carriers are able to improve outcome of patients with impaired perfusion and organ oxygenation.","fluorocarbon; hemoglobin; blood donor; blood transfusion; cell free system; cross linking; erythrocyte concentrate; erythrocyte transfusion; human; human cell; immunomodulation; oxygen transport; oxygenation; polymerization; review; substitution therapy"

MCTs are widely used for parenteral nutrition in individuals requiring supplemental nutrition and are being more widely used in foods, drugs and cosmetics. MCTs are essentially non-toxic in acute toxicity tests conducted in several species of animals. In ocular and dermal irritation testing MCTs exhibit virtually no potential as ocular or dermal irritants, even with prolonged eye or skin exposure. MCTs exhibit no capacity for induction of hypersensitivity. Ninety-day toxicity tests did not result in notable toxicity, whether the product was administered in the diet up to 9375 mg/kg body weight/day or by intramuscular (im) injection (up to 0.5 ml/kg/day, rabbits). There was no evidence that intravenous (iv) or dietary administration of MCTs adversely affected the reproductive performance of rats or resulted in maternal toxicity, foetal toxicity or teratogenic effects at doses up to 4.28 g/kg body weight/day (iv) or 12,500 mg/kg body weight/day (dietary). There was no evidence that dietary administration of MCTs adversely affected the reproductive performance of pigs or resulted in maternal toxicity, foetal toxicity or teratogenic effects at doses up to 4000 mg/kg body weight/day in the diet. In rabbits, following iv administration, the maternal and foetal no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) were between 1.0 and 4.28 g/kg body weight/day. A 2-year study in rats, conducted with a closely related compound (tricaprylin, a triglyceride with C8 fatty acids), provided no evidence of a carcinogenic effect when the material was administered by oral gavage at levels up to 10 ml/kg (9.54 g/kg) per day. Although tricaprylin was found to be positive in one of five strains of Salmonella typhimurium in the presence of metabolic activation in an Ames mutagenicity assay, the results of the carcinogenicity test with tricaprylin and mutagenicity tests with caprylic acid indicate that MCTs do not have the potential to be carcinogenic or mutagenic. The safety of human dietary consumption of MCTs, up to levels of 1 g/kg, has been confirmed in several clinical trials.

Tumor progression in vivo is associated with the appearance and selection of tumor cells with new specific characteristics: a high level of H2O2-catabolizing (antioxidant) activity (H2O2CA) and the ability for immediate release of E2-type prostaglandin (PGES) on contact with natural killers, macrophages, and neutrophils; the expression of the [H2O2CA + PGES] phenotype provides the tumor cells with two mechanisms of local protection against effectors of innate and acquired antitumor immunity. This results in a 10-100-fold less effective rejection of tumor cells in immune and normal animals and corresponding increase of tumorigenicity. The in vitro transformation of normal fibroblasts, spontaneous or induced by oncogenes LTSV40, Ela,b, Haras, myc, and also by p53175 and bcl-2 does not result in the [H2O2CA + PGES] phenotype expression, but during subsequent in vivo growth of the above-mentioned transformants the selection of tumor cells of the [H2O2CA + PGES] phenotype is correlated with a 30-200-fold increase in their tumorigenicity (accompanied or not accompanied by spontaneous metastatic activity). Unlike the transformation induced by the above-mentioned oncogenes, the transformation of normal cells by the v-src gene results in the [H2O2CA + PGES] phenotype expression. The data presented confirm the determining role of the v-src gene in the expression of the [H2O2CA + PGES] phenotype. In various primary viral carcinogeneses (SV40, SA7(C8)) the natural selection of cells expressing the [H2O2CA + PGES] phenotype begins even within the latent period and can be completed by the appearance of primary tumors.","hydrogen peroxide; prostaglandin E2; animal; cancer transplantation; cell line; disease course; hamster; immunology; metabolism; mouse; neoplasm; oncogene src; pathology; phenotype; physiology; rat; review; signal transduction; Syrian hamster; time; Animals; Cell Line, Transformed; Cricetinae; Dinoprostone; Disease Progression; Genes, src; Hydrogen Peroxide; Mesocricetus; Mice; Neoplasm Transplantation; Neoplasms; Phenotype; Rats; Signal Transduction; Time Factors"

Assembly of proteins into the cytokinetic ring appears to occur in a hierarchial order that is initiated by the FtsZ protein, a structural and functional analog of eukaryotic tubulins. Placement of the division site at its correct location in Escherichia coil requires a division inhibitor (MinC), that is responsible for preventing septation at unwanted sites near the cell poles, and a topological specificity protein (MinE), that forms a ring at midcell and protects the midcell site from the division inhibitor. However, the mechanism responsible for identifying the position of the midcell site or the polar sites used for spore septum formation is still unclear. Regulation of the division process and its coordination with other cell cycle events, such as chromosome replication, are poorly understood. However, a protein has been identified in Caulobacter (CtrA) that regulates both the initiation of chromosome regulation and the transcription of ftsZ, and that may play an important role in the coordination process.","bacterial protein; tubulin; Caulobacter; cell cycle; cell division; cell shape; chromosome replication; Escherichia coli; morphogenesis; priority journal; protein assembly; review; transcription regulation; translation regulation; Cell Division; Escherichia coli; Protein Biosynthesis; Transcription, Genetic; Bacteria (microorganisms); Caulobacter; Escherichia; Escherichia coli; Eukaryota; Negibacteria"

Neurosteroids modulate several neurotransmitter systems such as γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and acetylcholine receptors. As physiologic consequences, they are involved in neuronal plasticity, learning and memory processes, aggression and epilepsy, and they modulate the responses to stress, anxiety and depression. The σ1-receptor protein was recently purified and its cDNA was cloned in several species. The amino-acid sequences are structurally unrelated to known mammalian proteins, but shared homology with a fungal sterol C8-C7 isomerase. The σ1-receptor ligands exert a potent neuromodulation on excitatory neurotransmitter systems, including the glutamate and cholinergic systems. Consequently, selective σ1 agonists show neuroprotective properties and beneficial effects in memory processes, stress and depression. The evidence of a direct interaction between neurosteroids and σ1-receptors was first suggested by the ability of several steroids to inhibit the binding of σ1-receptor radioligands in vitro and in vivo. A crossed pharmacology between neurosteroids and σ1-receptor ligands was described in several physiological tests and behavioral responses. This review will detail the recent evidence for a common mechanism of action between neurosteroids and σ1-receptor ligands and focus on the potential therapeutic interests of such interaction in the physiopathology of learning and memory impairments, stress, depression and neuroprotection.","3alpha hydroxy 5alpha pregnan 20 one; 4 aminobutyric acid a receptor; calcium; cholinergic receptor; complementary DNA; glutamate receptor; isomerase; microbial enzyme; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; neuroprotective agent; neurosteroid; prasterone; pregnenolone; progesterone; sigma opiate receptor; sigma receptor ligand; aggression; amino acid sequence; amnesia; anxiety; behavior; calcium cell level; calcium transport; cholinergic system; cholinergic transmission; depression; drug mechanism; epilepsy; fungus; human; learning; learning disorder; memory; molecular cloning; nerve cell plasticity; neuromodulation; neuroprotection; neurotransmission; nonhuman; pathophysiology; physiology; review; sequence homology; stress; Animals; Humans; Nervous System; Nervous System Diseases; Receptors, sigma; Steroids"

PLV is under development as a treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome and other forms of acute respiratory failure. The fluid currently in clinical trials is perfluorooctyl bromide, an inert, nonbiodegradable perfluorocarbon which is immiscible with water and very poorly absorbed from the alveolus. It is an avid solvent for oxygen and carbon dioxide and has a remarkably low surface tension. When instilled into the surfactant deficient lung or the lung with surfactant dysfunction, it reduces surface tension at the alveolar lining. The liquid also occupies air spaces, so its presence in the lung recruits atelectatic alveoli. It may also facilitate recruitment by enhancing removal of secretions. There is now evidence that perflubron modulates pulmonary inflammation and that its presence stretches the lung and promotes de novo synthesis of endogenous surfactant. Preclinical evidence suggests that, by several mechanisms, perflubron PLV improves both gas exchange and outcome in animal models of lung disease.

First experiments done with crude thymus extracts were followed by isolation of purified products and finally by chemical characterization and synthesis of immunologically active thymus- derived peptides. In this article we review the various thymic hormones and factors described, that is, thymosin fractions 5, the thymosins, prothymosin α, thymulin (FTS-Zn), thymopoietin, thymostimulin (TP-1), Thymic humoral factor (THF), and THF-γ2. Studies demonstrating the activity of the various thymic factors in increasing the immunocompetence potential in both in vitro and in vivo conditions are discussed.

This barrier between the body and the environment is constantly maintained by reproduction of inner living epidermal keratinocytes which undergo a process of terminal differentiation and then migrate to the surface as interlocking layers of dead stratum corneum cells. These cells provide the bulwark of mechanical and chemical protection, and together with their intercellular lipid surroundings, confer water-impermeability. Much of this barrier function is provided by the cornified cell envelope (CE), an extremely tough protein/lipid polymer structure formed just below the cytoplasmic membrane and subsequently resides on the exterior of the dead cornified cells. It consists of two parts: a protein envelope and a lipid envelope. The protein envelope is thought to contribute to the biomechanical properties of the CE as a result of cross-linking of specialized CE structural proteins by both disulfide bonds and N(ε)-(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bonds formed by transglutaminases. Some of the structural proteins involved include involucrin, loricrin, small proline rich proteins, keratin intermediate filaments, elafin, cystatin A, and desmosomal proteins. The lipid envelope is located on the exterior of and covalently attached by ester bonds to the protein envelope and consists of a monomolecular layer of ω-hydroxyceramides. These not only serve of provide a Teflon-like coating to the cell, but also interdigitate with the intercellular lipid lamellae perhaps in a Velcro-like fashion. In fact the CE is a common feature of all stratified squamous epithelia, although its precise composition, structure and barrier function requirements vary widely between epithelia. Recent work has shown that a number of diseases which display defective epidermal barrier function, generically known as ichthyoses, are the result of genetic defects of the synthesis of either CE proteins, the transglutaminase 1 cross-linking enzyme, or defective metabolism of skin lipids.","ceramide derivative; cystatin; elafin; involucrin; keratin; lipid; loricrin; proline; protein; protein glutamine gamma glutamyltransferase; structural protein; cell differentiation; cell membrane; cell migration; disulfide bond; epidermis; epidermis cell; intermediate filament; keratinocyte; mammal; nonhuman; review; skin permeability; squamous epithelium; stratum corneum; water loss; Mammalia"

All, except DiMeIQx, have been shown to be carcinogenic in animals. These compounds are present in cooked muscle meats at the p.p.b. level. Since the discovery of the HCAs in the late 1970s, many studies have examined the DNA adducts of these compounds. This review compiles the literature on AIA-DNA adducts including their identification and characterization, pathways of formation, mutagenesis in vitro and in vivo, and their association with carcinogenesis in animal models. It is now known that metabolic activation leading to the formation of DNA adducts is critical for mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of these compounds. All of the AIAs studied adduct to the guanine base, the major adduct being formed at the C8 position. Two AIAs, IQ and MeIQx, also form minor adducts at the NZ position of guanine. A growing body of literature has reported on the mutation spectra induced by AIA-guanine adducts. Studies of animal tumors induced by AIAs have begun to relate AIA-DNA adduct-induced mutagenic events with the mutations found in critical genes associated with oncogenesis. Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of chemoprevention of AIA tumorigenesis. Only a few studies have reported on the detection of AIA-DNA adducts in human tissues; difficulties persist in the routine detection of ALA-DNA adducts in humans for the purpose of biomonitoring of exposure to AIAs. The AIAs are nevertheless regarded as possible human carcinogens, and future research on AIA-DNA adducts is likely to help address the role of AIAs in human cancer.","guanine; heterocyclic amine; biological monitoring; carcinogenesis; chemoprophylaxis; DNA adduct; food processing; human; metabolic activation; mutagenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; review"

They are anchored to the inner surface of the cell membrane where receptor-mediated signalling induces Ras activation (GDP/GTP exchange) and inactivation (stimulation of Ras GTPase activity). Ras-GTP in turn activates a multitude of signalling cascades controlling cell growth and differentiation. Aberrant Ras function (mostly constitutive activation) contributes to the development of many types of neoplastic human diseases. Activating mutations in ras genes, leading to the expression of Ras proteins insensitive to Ras-GTPase activating proteins, are found in as many as 30% of all human tumours. This suggests that Ras is an appropriate target for drug design. Remarkable improvements in the understanding of post-translational modifications in Ras that promote Ras-membrane anchorage. in the mechanisms of activation and inactivation of Ras, and in the interactions of Ras with a plethora of effector molecules have led to the development of new concepts for Ras-directed therapy. The most advanced approach has been that of farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) designed to inhibit the farnesylation of Ras required for membrane anchorage and transforming activity. FTIs now in clinical trials have been extensively reviewed. Here we review the progress in the development of FTIs and in the development of other promising concepts for Ras-directed therapy. These include compounds such as S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS), which disrupt the proper anchorage of Ras with the cell membrane acid inhibit human tumour growth in animal models, and compounds that interfere with interactions of Ras with its downstream effecters. We conclude with a description of a recently described novel drug concept that could restore the defective GTPase activity of oncogenic Ras and with the interesting results of reovirus-induced tumour regression observed in animal models of human rumours containing an intact Ras signalling pathway.","antineoplastic agent; cell membrane protein; cell surface receptor; farnesylthiosalicylic acid; guanosine diphosphate; guanosine triphosphatase; guanosine triphosphate; protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor; Ras protein; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; autoimmune disease; cancer inhibition; carcinogenesis; cell differentiation; cell growth; confocal microscopy; drug design; drug targeting; enzyme activation; gene mutation; human; human cell; melanoma; nonhuman; oncogene ras; pancreas tumor; protein processing; review; tumor regression"

The isolation of a cDNA clone encoding a mannan-binding protein associated serine protease (MASP)-1-like protein from the Japanese dog fish (Triakis scyllia) suggests the presence of a lectin pathway. The CCP consists of six functionally distinct components: C1n, C2n, C3n, C4n, C8n and C9n, and is activated by immune complexes in the presence of Ca++ and Mg++ ions. The ACP is antibody independent, requiring Mg++ ions and a heat-labile 90 kDa factor B-like protein for activity. Proteins considered homologues of C1q, C3 and C4 (C2n) of the mammalian complement system have been isolated from nurse shark serum. Shark C1q is composed of at least two chain types each showing 50% identity to human C1q chains A and B. Partial sequence of the globular domain of one of the chains shows it to be C1q-like rather than like mannan-binding protein. N-terminal amino acid sequences of the α and β chain of shark C3 and C4 molecules show significant identity with corresponding human C3 and C4 chains. A sequence representing shark C4 γ chain, shows little similarity to human C4 γ chain. The terminal shark components C8n and C9n are functional analogues of mammalian C8 and C9. Anaphylatoxin activity has been demonstrated in activated shark serum, and porcine C5a desArg induces shark leucocyte chemotaxis. The deduced amino acid sequence of a partial C3 cDNA clone from the nurse shark shows 50%, 30% and 24% homology with the corresponding region of mammalian C3, C4 and α2-macroglobulin. Deduced amino acid sequence data from partial Bf/C2 cDNA clones, two from the nurse shark and one from the Japanese dogfish, suggest that at least one species of elasmobranch has two distinct Bf/C2 genes.","calcium ion; complement component c1q; complement component c3; complement component c4; complement component c5a; complement component c8; complement component c9; complementary DNA; magnesium ion; serine proteinase; amino acid sequence; amino terminal sequence; anaphylaxis; antigen antibody complex; chemotaxis; complement activation; complement system; dogfish; priority journal; review; shark; Amino Acid Sequence; Anaphylatoxins; Animals; Complement C8; Complement C9; Complement Factor H; Complement System Proteins; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Sharks"

The dynamic adsorption behavior may be governed by a two-step process: (1) the transfer of molecules between the surface layer and the subsurface layer, which has a thickness of a few molecular diameters only; (2) the exchange of molecules between the subsurface and the bulk solution. The first step is an adsorption process and the second step is a mass transfer process. Between the subsurface and the bulk solution is an undisturbed boundary layer where mass transport occurs by diffusion only. The thickness of this boundary layer may be reduced by stirring. Rapid film formation by adsorption bursts from lipid extract surfactants, as observed in the captive bubble system, suggests that the adsorption process as defined above is accompanied by a relatively large negative change in the free energy. This reduction in the free energy is provided by a configurational change in the association of the specific surfactant proteins and the surfactant lipids during adsorption. The negative change in the free energy during film formation more than compensates for the energy barrier related to the film surface pressure. In the traditional view, the extracellular alveolar lining layer is composed of two parts, an aqueous subphase and a surfactant film, believed to be a monolayer, at the air-water interface. The existence and continuity of the aqueous subphase has recently been demonstrated by Bastacky and coworkers, and a continuous polymorphous film has recently been shown by Bachofen and his associates, using perfusion fixation of rabbit lungs with slight edema. In the present chapter, we have described a fixation technique using a non-aqueous fixation medium of perfluorocarbon and osmium tetroxide to fix the peripheral airspaces of guinea pig lungs. A continuous osmiophilic film which covers the entire alveolar surface, including the pores of Kohn, is demonstrated. By transmission electron microscopy, the surface film frequently appears multilaminated, not only in the alveolar corners or crevices, but also at the thin air-blood barrier above the capillaries. Disk-like structures or multilamellar vesicles appear partially integrated into the planar multilayered film. In corners and crevices, tubular myelin appears closely associated with the surface film. Tubular myelin, however, is not necessary for the generation of a multilaminated film. This is demonstrated in vitro by the fixation for electron microscopy of a film formed from lipid extract surfactant on a captive bubble. Films formed from relatively high surfactant concentration (1 mg/ml of phospholipid) are of variable thickness and frequent multilayers are seen. In contrast, at 0.3 mg/ml, only an amorphous film can be visualized. Although near zero minimum surface tensions can be obtained for both surfactant concentrations, film compressibility and mechanical stability are substantially better at the higher concentrations. This appears to be related to the multilaminated structure of the film formed at the higher concentration.

These phases have also been successfully used in sample preparation techniques, mainly in solid phase extraction (SPE). Although alkyl bonded phases (e.g., C2, C8, and C18) are the most widely used packings in RP HPLC and SPE, various specific applications require CBPs with polar functional groups (e.g., -NH2, -NO2, - CN, and/or -OH). The solution of problems with separation of complicated chiral compounds was attempted by applying stationary phases with chiral selectors (e.g., cyclodextrins, Pirkle phases, crown ethers, etc.). On the other hand, packings with pseudo-membrane or liquid crystal properties have been utilized for the separation of various substances of natural origin. Porous silica is commonly used as a support in the preparation of CBPs. Its physico-chemical characteristics, such as: type and structure of siliceous matrix, porosity, type and concentration of silanol groups, as well as surface purity, strongly influence the density and structure of chemically bonded phases. Recognition of these properties is helpful in optimizing separation processes based on RP HPLC elution and/or extraction of substances with polar character.","silica gel; silicon dioxide; adsorption; analytic method; desorption; liquid chromatography; particle size; reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; reversed phase liquid chromatography; review; surface property"

Drugs and toxic agents are in vivo metabolized in such a way that more polar compounds are usually formed. Derivatization of these metabolites is often an unavoidable requirement for gas chromatographic analysis. Application of derivatization methods in recent years has been relevant, especially for silylation, acylation, alkylation and the formation of cyclic or diastereomeric derivatives. Given the relevance of drug of abuse testing in modern toxicology, main derivatization procedures for opiates, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, benzodiazepines and LSD have been reviewed. Papers describing the analyses of drugs of abuse in matrixes other than blood, such as hair or sweat, have received especial attention. Advances in derivatization for sports drug testing have been particularly relevant for anabolic steroids, diuretics and corticosteroids. Among the several methodologies applied, the formation of trimethylsilyl, perfluoroacyl or methylated derivatives have probed to be both versatile and extensively used. Further advances in derivatization for GC-MS applications in clinical and forensic toxicology will depend on the one hand on the degree of further use of GC-MS for routine applications and, on the other hand, on the alternative progress made for developments in LC-MS or CE-MS. Last but not least, the appearance of comprehensive libraries in which reference spectra for different derivatives of many drugs and their metabolites are collected will have an important impact on the expansion of derivatization in GC-MS for toxicological applications.","amphetamine derivative; anabolic agent; benzodiazepine derivative; cannabis; cocaine; corticosteroid; diuretic agent; lysergide; opiate derivative; xenobiotic agent; acylation; alkylation; chirality; cyclization; derivatization; doping; drug abuse; gas chromatography; human; mass spectrometry; priority journal; review; toxicology"

Several injectable compounds have been used in a small number of patients during the 1940s and through the 1960s; however, the results were not very successful and often led to significant complications. More recently, two major materials have been developed that seem to be useful in treating stress incontinence by periurethral injection: Polytef paste and GAX collagen. Other injectables include autologous fat tissue and silicone microimplants. The most suitable patients for periurethral injection are elderly women, patients who constitute high operative risk, and those with stress incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter failure. Patients with stress incontinence due to a combination of urethral hypermobility and intrinsic sphincter deficiency with failure of suspension procedure may also benefit from the procedure. The reported long-term (more than 24 months) success rates according to the various substances are as follows: Teflon (Polytef) (E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co, Wilmington, DE): 30 to 38 percent cured or improved; repeated injections usually do not improve the outcome; mostly minor complications with case reports of more serious side effects such as periurethral granuloma formation and bladder outlet obstruction. GAX collagen: 69 to 77 percent subjectively cured or improved after 24 months; 54 to 57 percent objectively cured or improved, the reported morbidity in these procedures is minimal; repeated injections can improve the outcome. The experience with autologous fat and silicone microimplants is insufficient, with an overall success rate of 70 percent (1-40 months follow-up; mean 12 months) and 58 to 70 percent (17-36 months), respectively. Most of the procedures are performed as outpatient cases, and some under local anesthesia. These procedures are minimally invasive, usually safe and well tolerated, require shorter hospitalization, and are cost effective.

Design: Randomized, controlled study. Setting: Animal laboratory and pathology laboratories of a university hospital. Subjects: Fourteen healthy adult sheep, weighing 64.9 ± 6.4 kg. Interventions: Lung injury was induced with oleic acid (0.15 mL/kg). A tracheostomy tube was inserted, along with systemic and pulmonary artery monitoring catheters. Animals were randomized to undergo either partial liquid ventilation (n = 7) or gas ventilation (n = 7). Animals underwent euthanasia at the end of the 90-min study period, after which the endotracheal tube was clamped with the lungs in expiratory hold at a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O. En bloc excision of the heart and lungs was performed by thoracotomy. Perfusion of the isolated lung vasculature with 2.5% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in a 0.1-M phosphate buffer was performed. Histologic analysis followed. Measurements and Main Results: Gas exchange increased markedly in the animals that underwent partial liquid ventilation compared with the gas-ventilated animals (Pao2 at 90 mins: gas ventilation-treatment group, 40 ± 8 torr [5.3 ± 1.1 kPa]; partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, 108 ± 60 torr [14.4 ± 8.0 kPa]; p = .004). Lung histologic analysis demonstrated a better overall diffuse alveolar damage score (partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, 12.4 ± 1.4; gas ventilation-treatment group, 15.0 ± 1.7; p = .01). In the partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, we observed an increase in mean alveolar diameter (partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, 82.4 ± 2.9 μm; gas ventilation-treatment group, 67.7 ± 3.9 μm; p = .0022) and a decrease in the number of alveoli per high-power field (partial liquid ventilation- treatment group, 25.7 ± 0.9, gas ventilation-treatment group, 31.4 ± 2.5; p = .0022), in septal wall thickness (partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, 6.0 ± 0.6 μm; gas ventilation-treatment group, 8.3 ± 1.0 μm; p = .0033), and in mean capillary diameter (partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, 13.0 ± 0.8 μm; gas ventilation-treatment group, 19.9 ± 1.4 μm; p = .0022).

Administration of these chemicals to rodents results in a number of effects, the most prominent being hepatomegaly and induction of peroxisomal enzyme activities. Several of these compounds have also been associated with the production of liver tumors in rodents and are classified as nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogens. Experimental evidence suggests that humans are not susceptible to these effects following exposure to peroxisome-proliferating compounds. This has led to the proposal that an 'actual threat to humans' from exposure to one of these compounds seems 'rather unlikely'. Indeed, recent reports suggest that peroxisome proliferators may prove valuable as antitumor agents in humans. However, this assessment is preliminary given that peroxisome proliferators also produce a myriad of extraperoxisomal effects in livers and other tissues of experimental animals. Such effects include both stimulation and inhibition of mitochondrial and microsomal metabolism and alteration of the activities of various cytosolic enzymes. These responses may be directly or indirectly related to the effects on peroxisomes or may be totally independent of these events. Whether the extraperoxisomal effects of these compounds occur in humans is not known and their potential impact on human health remains to be investigated.","carboxylic acid derivative; fibric acid derivative; peroxisome proliferator; phenoxyacetic acid derivative; phthalic acid derivative; enzyme induction; health hazard; hepatosplenomegaly; human; microsome; mitochondrial respiration; nonhuman; peroxisome; review; toxin analysis; Animals; Antilipemic Agents; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinogens; Cytosol; Enzyme Induction; Fatty Acids; Fluorocarbons; Hepatomegaly; Herbicides; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Mice; Microbodies; Microsomes, Liver; Mitochondria, Liver; Plasticizers; Rats; Animalia; Rodentia"

Skin is a target organ for PDT, because of the increasing incidence of skin cancers and the easy accessibility to photosensitizing drugs and light. Skin oxygen tension changes dramatically during and after PDT and seems to be an important treatment parameter. Experimental approaches to modulate oxygen tension (e.g., hyperbaric oxygenation, hyperthermia, or perfluorocarbons) have been studied mainly in animals, and some of these techniques may have the potential to be applied in humans to improve the efficacy and safety of PDT. The main purpose of this review is to provide the reader with current information on cutaneous oxygen physiology and oximetry, the role of oxygen and singlet oxygen (1O2) in PDT, and approaches to modulate skin oxygen tension. The literature indicates that it may be possible to utilize transcutaneous oxygen measurements as a valuable measure of the clinical effectiveness of PDT and as an in sire predictor of the energy required to elicit a biological response. Consequently the effectiveness of PDT can be manipulated by modulating skin oxygen tension.","deuterium oxide; fluorocarbon; free radical; oxygen; porphyrin; singlet oxygen; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; human; hyperbaric oxygen; hyperthermia; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; oximetry; oxygen tension; photodynamic therapy; photooxidation; photosensitization; polarography; priority journal; review; safety; signal transduction; skin cancer; ultraviolet a radiation; Antineoplastic Agents; Combined Modality Therapy; Humans; Oxygen; Photochemotherapy; Signal Transduction; Skin; Skin Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome; Animalia"

The optimal ventilatory strategy may be difficult to achieve, especially in patients with respiratory failure. Total liquid ventilation is a process whereby a liquid perfluorocarbon (PFC) replaces both the functional residual capacity and the tidal volume within the lung. Gas exchange is accomplished by mechanically assisted inspiration and expiration of tidal volumes of the liquid using a liquid ventilator. The PFC liquid is then oxygenated and purged of carbon dioxide by a membrane lung. Perfluorocarbons are excellent media for gas exchange due to their extraordinary gas solubility and diffusibility of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) is a modified method of the total liquid ventilation technique. In PLV, a functional residual capacity of PFC liquid is maintained in the lung, and the patient is ventilated with a conventional gas mechanical ventilator. Studies of the acute respiratory distress syndrome in animal models and in human series have demonstrated encouraging results using PLV and PFC. The high density, low surface tension, and other qualities of PFC in the setting of PLV may offer a highly innovative approach that can be directed toward the management of patients in respiratory failure.","fluorocarbon; adult respiratory distress syndrome; animal; artificial ventilation; chemistry; drug effect; functional residual capacity; human; lung gas exchange; methodology; pathophysiology; review; tidal volume; treatment outcome; Animals; Fluorocarbons; Functional Residual Capacity; Humans; Pulmonary Gas Exchange; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Tidal Volume; Treatment Outcome"

Immunomorphological changes characteristic of human thymic involution begin during or soon after the first year after birth, and continue progressively throughout the entire life span. The 3% to 5% annual reduction in the number of cells of the human thymic microenvironment continues until middle age, when it slows down to less than 1% per year. According to the extrapolation of these results, total loss of thymic reticulo-epithelial (RE) tissue and the associated thymocytes should occur at the age of 120 years in humans. The marked reduction of the thymic cellular microenvironment is a well-controlled physiological process and is presumably under both local and global regulation by the cells of the RE meshwork and by the neuroendocrine axis, respectively. In humans, the age related decline of facteur thymique serique (FTS) levels in blood begins after 20 years of age and FTS completely disappears between the 5th and 6th decade of life. In contrast, serum levels of thymosin-α1 and thymopoietin seem to decline earlier, starting as early as 10 years of age. The influences of a variety of other hormones on the involution of the thymus have also been characterized testosterone, estrogen, and hydrocortisone treatment results in marked involution, cortisone and progesterone administration have a slight to moderate effect while use of desoxycorticosterone has no effect. The experimental administration of thyroxin yielded dose dependent results: low doses resulted in thymic hypertrophy, higher doses produced a slight hypertrophy, while the highest employed doses caused thymic atrophy. The atrophy was of apicnotic type, very different from that detected after treatment with corticoid hormones. Thymus transplantation experiments indicate that age-related physiological thymic involution has been genetically preprogrammed. Grafting of the thymus from one week old C3H leukemic strain mice into 6 month old hosts resulted in changes in thymic weight and involution patterns that were synchronous in all recipients, in direct correlation with the glands in the donor, but not in the host. These data strongly suggest that the stimulus for thymus cell proliferation and differentiation is genetically determined within the organ implant. Since the thymus is the primary T-lymphopoietic organ during mammalian ontogenesis, its age-related involution with typical immunomorphological alterations can be held responsible only for the decline in antigen-specific T lymphocyte immune functions. Thymic involution and diminished T lymphocyte proliferation can be partially restored by thymic tissue transplantation or use of thymic hormones. The only partial reconstitution of CD4+ T helper lymphocyte subset after antineoplastic chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation represents a significant, therapy complicating clinical problem. After high-dose chemotherapy, restoration of thymus dependent CD4+ T lymphocyte genesis was reported only in children. Our radiation stem cell transplantation, and hormone treatment experiments in animals strongly suggest age and time dependent regeneration of the cytoarchitecture of the thymic cellular microenvironment, as well as intrathymic lymphopoiesis. The human body's zinc pool undergoes progressive reduction, resulting in low zinc plasma levels and a negative crude zinc balance in older rodents, as well as humans. Previous research suggests that the diminished bioavailability of zinc in older mammals may represent one of the major factors for the involution of the thymus and consequent cellular immunological dysfunction. In PBMCs, zinc induces several cytokines, predominantly IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α, and, therefore, has an immense immunoregulative capacity. These effects are highly specific for the this element and neither biologically important bivalent ions like calcium or magnesium, nor structurally equivalent cations like nickel or cobalt can mimic these zinc-dependent effects. Cytokine induction by zinc is caused by a direct interaction between zinc with monocytes. By contrast, the stimulatory effect of zinc on T lymphocytes represents an indirect effect via monocyte-secreted IL-1 and direct cell to cell contact. Clinical symptoms of zinc deficiency include not only serious accidental thymic atrophy, but also a related high frequency of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. Zinc treatment to improve nonspecific immunoregulation and its use as a non-toxic agent of immunosuppression has been suggested.","cortisone; cytokine; deoxycorticosterone; estrogen; hydrocortisone; interleukin 1; interleukin 6; progesterone; testosterone; thymopoietin; thymosin alpha1; thymus hormone; thyroxine; tumor necrosis factor alpha; zinc; animal tissue; bioavailability; bone marrow transplantation; cancer chemotherapy; cell density; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; dog; female; fetus; histogenesis; hormone blood level; human; human tissue; immunoregulation; involution; lifespan; lymphopoiesis; male; monocyte; mouse; nonhuman; ontogeny; reticuloendothelial system; review; stem cell transplantation; T lymphocyte; thymocyte; thymus; thymus atrophy; thymus transplantation; zinc deficiency"

In the other patient with a type I early rupture, control of bleeding was attempted by external direct suture using Teflon felt. The bleeding was controlled by this repair and the use of a left ventricular assist device, but the patient died of a brain infarction 5 days after the operation. The manual compression technique using oxidized cellulose, collagen mat and fibrin glue may be useful for minor lacerations, and for reinforcing repairs.

Partial liquid ventilation can be used for the following goals: recruitment of lung volume; enhancement or uniformity of lung inflation; improved oxygenation; improved lung compliance; and prevention or minimization of lung damage induced by mechanical ventilation. Partial liquid ventilation improved gas exchange and lung mechanics in test subjects. Cardiopulmonary interaction and long-term safety require further study. Extrapolations from animal data, however, suggest that there are no long-term undesired effects. The current clinical data strongly suggest that close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator parameters during drug instillation are necessary to reduce hypoxia, bradycardia, and pneumothorax. Further studies are required to explore the efficacy of partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbon in ALI or ARDS subjects, in particular, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of smaller doses; mechanical ventilation strategies; and outcomes.

A mechanism for the organ-specific toxicity of these compounds to the kidney has been elucidated. The mechanism involves hepatic glutathione conjugation to dihaloalkenyl or 1,1-difluoroalkyl glutathione S-conjugates, which are cleaved by γ-glutamyltransferase and dipeptidases to cysteine S-conjugates. Haloalkene-derived cysteine S-conjugates may have four fates in the organism: (a) They may be substrates for renal cysteine conjugate β-lyases, which cleave them to form reactive intermediates identified as thioketenes (chloroalkene-derived S-conjugates), thionoacyl halides (fluoroalkene- derived S-conjugates not containing bromide), thuranes, and thiolactones (fluoroalkene-derived S-conjugates containing bromine); (b) cysteine S- conjugates may be N-acetylated to excretable mercapturic acids; (c) they may undergo transamination or oxidation to the corresponding 3-mercaptopyruvic acid S-conjugate; (d) finally, oxidation of the sulfur atom in halovinyl cysteine S-conjugates and corresponding mercapturic acids forms Michael acceptors and may also represent a bioactivation reaction.

There are two major classes of this new generation of oxygen therapeutics; (1) modified haemoglobin solutions, referred to as haemoglobin-based blood substitutes (HBBS) and (2) perfluorocarbon emulsions. Tremendous progress has been made in the past four years with the development of HBBS. In comparison, not much progress has been made in the development of perfluorocarbons as oxygen carriers. In the present review discussion is limited to the development of HBBS. Several types of HBBS have been developed and are in different phases of clinical trials. Free haemoglobin has been crosslinked, conjugated, polymerised or encapsulated to prevent its dissociation into dimers. The stability and purity of HBBS are extremely important in overcoming most of the significant toxicities of these products. Commercial manufacturers have utilised better proprietary formulations and purification technologies, and HBBS developed by these organisations have demonstrated safety in both preclinical and clinical studies. Recent research activities suggest a broad range of therapeutic applications for this new generation of oxygen therapeutics. The introduction of HBBS in critical care medicine will provide a new approach of not only improving perfusion, but also delivering oxygen to tissues.","blood substitute; cyclic gmp; endothelin; fluorocarbon; hemoglobin; nitric oxide; cardiovascular system; drug safety; human; intensive care; review; sepsis; transfusion"

Therefore, endurance athletes are recommended to ingest diets high in carbohydrate (70% of total energy) during competition and training. However, increasing the availability of plasma free fatty acids has been shown to slow the rate of muscle and liver glycogen depletion by promoting the utilization of fat. Ingested fat, in the form of long-chain (C16-22) triacylglycerols, is largely unavailable during acute exercise, but medium-chain (C8-10) triacylglycerols are rapidly absorbed and oxidized. We have shown that the ingestion of medium-chain triacylglycerols in combination with carbohydrate spares muscle carbohydrate stores during 2 h of submaximal (&lt; 70% VO2, peak) cycling exercise, and improves 40 km time-trial performance. These data suggest that by combining carbohydrate and medium-chain triacylglycerols as a pre-exercise supplement and as a nutritional supplement during exercise, fat oxidation will be enhanced, and endogenous carbohydrate will be spared. We have also examined the chronic metabolic adaptations and effects on substrate utilization and endurance performance when athletes ingest a diet that is high in fat (&gt; 70% by energy). Dietary fat adaptation for a period of at least 2-4 weeks has resulted in a nearly two-fold increase in resistance to fatigue during prolonged, low- to moderate-intensity cycling (&lt; 70% VO2, peak). Moreover, preliminary studies suggest that mean cycling 20 km time-trial performance following prolonged submaximal exercise is enhanced by 80 s after dietary fat adaptation and 3 days of carbohydrate loading. Thus the relative contribution of fuel substrate to prolonged endurance activity may be modified by training, pre-exercise feeding, habitual diet, or by artificially altering the hormonal milieu or the availability of circulating fuels. The time course and dose-response of these effects on maximizing the oxidative contribution of fat for exercise metabolism and in exercise performance have not been systematically studied during moderate- to high-intensity exercise in humans.","carbohydrate; lipid; triacylglycerol; athlete; carbohydrate diet; cycling; endurance; exercise; fatigue; human; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid oxidation; muscle metabolism; nutrition; review; training; Adipose Tissue; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Exercise; Fatigue; Fatty Acids; Glycogen; Humans; Oxidation-Reduction; Physical Endurance; Triglycerides"

Maternal factors during pregnancy including coffee drinking or polydrug use, and malconditions, such as premature rupturing of the membranes or placental abnormalities, were present at higher frequencies in FTE than FTS, although the factors of smoking and light drinking during pregnancy did not differ between them. As an indicator of maldevelopment of the brain, CNS involvement was more frequent and severer in FTE than in FTS. These findings suggest that factors in addition to smoking causing reduction in the gestation period may contribute to CNS involvement. As to the concomitant effects of ethanol and tobacco on maldevelopment of the brain, CNS involvement was highest in the offspring of women who both smoked and drank heavily. In conclusion, based on the concept of FTE in addition to FTS, a causal relationship between prenatal smoking and maldevelopment of the brains of offspring has to be investigated, especially as to factors modifying the effects of tobacco during pregnancy.",

Hemoglobin-based solutions and fluorocarbons are currently under clinical investigation. Hemoglobin solutions are produced from different sources with various difficulties. The major sources of hemoglobin solutions available today are human blood, bovine blood and recombinant hemoglobin. Whatever the origin, hemoglobin solutions must be highly purified, have a normal affinity for oxygen and a sufficiently long intravascular half-life. Biochemical or genetic modifications of the hemoglobin molecule have fulfilled these criteria. Most solutions have already been tested in hemorrhagic shock models with positive results. However, a vasoconstrictive effect which is at least partly dependent upon the ability of hemoglobin to capture NO, has been demonstrated in these studies. Fluorocarbons represent another approach in the search for blood substitutes. Available preparations are highly concentrated and stable at room temperature. Fluorocarbons are prepared as lipid emulsions which are practically ready to use. Oxygen transport with fluorocarbon is a function of fluocrit and PO2. Interestingly, fluorocarbons may improve oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues. In combination with perioperative blood conservation techniques, blood substitutes should increase the margin of safety of normovolemic hemodilution and decrease the exposure to allogenic blood.

Others suffer chronic lung disease, require prolonged ventilatory support, and experience significant morbidity during infancy due to the elevated inflation pressures used to treat their respiratory problems. Over the past 30 years, results of studies in premature animals as well as clinical trials have demonstrated that ventilation with oxygenated perfluorochemical (PFC) fluids provides effective gas exchange and improved lung mechanics. PFC fluids are biologically inert, have a high gas solubility and a low surface tension, and are nonbiotransformable. With liquid ventilation, alveolar pressures are low because the high surface tension of the gas-lung interface in eliminated. Potential neonatal applications include surfactant deficiency, persistent pulmonary hypertension, meconium aspiration, diaphragmatic hernia, pneumonia, and a vehicle for drug delivery.

PFCs are used for two major medical indications: as artificial blood substitutes and as a medium for liquid ventilation. The PFC perflubron is additionally used as a contrast medium for diagnostic radiologic procedures. For the intravenous application perfluorocarbons have to be emulgated in phospholipids for the intrapulmonary application the sterile pure solution is used. Liquid ventilation can either be performed by a method known as total liquid ventilation (TLV), in which a device is utilised to ventilate with perfluorocarbon the previously perfluorocarbon-filled lung, or as partial liquid ventilation (PLV) in which a conventional mechanical gas ventilator is used to gas ventilate the partially perfluorocarbon-filled lung. A number of studies have demonstrated the efficacy of perfluorocarbon liquid ventilation in improving gas exchange and pulmonary function in a number of animal species in the setting of acute respiratory failure. In 1989 Greenspan reported on the first human liquid ventilation experience in a neonate. More recently human experiences for neonatal, paediatric and adult patients with acute lung injury have been reported. Since 1995 an FDA-approved study to examine the efficacy of PLV in severe respiratocy failure in patients of all ages has been undertaken in the United States. The number of PLV-treated patients is still small; if PLV demonstrates its efficacy even in the ongoing human studies, it might be a very effective additional tool for treating severe acute lung injury.","contrast medium; fluorocarbon; artificial ventilation; aspiration; bronchoscopy; gas exchange; human; inhalation anesthesia; lung injury; respiratory failure; review; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; animal; child; equipment design; instrumentation; lung gas exchange; neonatal respiratory distress syndrome; newborn; oxygen therapy; pathophysiology; physiology; respiratory failure; treatment outcome; Adult; Animals; Child; Equipment Design; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Pulmonary Gas Exchange; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn; Respiratory Insufficiency; Treatment Outcome"

However, the technique has been so successful in animal models of lung disease that it is currently being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of infant and acute ('adult') respiratory distress syndrome in newborns, children, and adults. A common feature of both infant and acute respiratory distress syndromes is an inability of the lung's surfactant system to adequately lower surface tension, leading to regions of atelectasis. Liquid ventilation with PFC appears to ameliorate the disease process by lowering interfacial tension in the lung, opening regions of atelectasis, and improving gas exchange. To understand how gas exchange is successful during liquid ventilation requires careful re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying our current models of gas exchange physiology during normal gas ventilation. These assumptions must then be examined in light of the alterations in pulmonary physiology during liquid ventilation.","perfluoro compound; animal experiment; atelectasis; guinea pig; lung alveolus surface tension; lung compliance; lung gas exchange; lung ventilation distribution; lung ventilation perfusion ratio; nonhuman; priority journal; rabbit; respiratory distress syndrome; review; total lung capacity; treatment outcome"

In experimental models, interventions aimed at PMN inhibition can exert cardioprotective effects, and some of these strategies raise hope for future clinical applications.

When used to emulsify fluorocarbons, as for in vivo oxygen transport, such compounds can confer emulsion stability and a certain control over particle size. Considerable emulsion stabilization and improved control over particle size are also obtained by using a combination of standard phospholipids and mixed fluorocarbon-hydrocarbon compounds such as 3a or 3c. The highly fluorinated chains of 1 and 2 generate strong hydrophobic interactions, which enhance the tendency for these fluorinated amphiphiles to form vesicles (F-vesicles). This is strikingly demonstrated by the fact that even the short, single-chain perfluoroalkylated phosphocholine derivatives 1a and 1c readily form stable, heatsterilizable vesicles and other supramolecular assemblies, including globules and fibers without the need for any additive. The F-alkylated phosphatidylcholines 2 also form unusually stable, heat-sterilizable, small unilamellar vesicles with long room temperature shelf-life. The presence of a fluorinated core within the membrane of F-vesicles results in lower permeability to both hydrophilic and lipophilic encapsulated species. The solubilization of the paramagnetic probe Tempo in the membrane is, in most cases, totally suppressed. The release of entrapped 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein from F-vesicles is considerably slower than from liposomes made from hydrocarbon analogs; it is also less affected by serum components. Also noteworthy is the significantly prolonged intravascular persistence observed for F-vesicles made from 2e and 2f compared to DSPC or DSPC/cholesterol liposomes. Stable vesicles with a fluorinated core are also obtained from equimolar combinations of standard phospholipids and mixed hydrocarbon-fluorocarbon molecules such as 3. Preliminary biological results, which include very low hemolytic activity, reduced hydrolysis by PLA2 of phospholipids when combined with appropriate fluorocarbon-hydrocarbon compounds, decreased protein adsorption and phagocytic uptake in serum of microspheres coated with fluorinated surfactants and, in some cases, very high LD50 values i.v. in mice, are encouraging and should trigger further investigations on the pharmacology of such surfactants. © 1995 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

N-Dealkylation is favored over N-oxygenation for secondary and tertiary amines with both kinds of enzymes, but in the peroxidase-like enzymes N-oxygenation is even less favorable because of apparent restriction of the Fe-O complex in the active site. Among the rat liver P450s many of the carcinogenic primary arylamines and heterocyclic amines are N-oxygenated by P450 1A2 to form the N-hydroxy arylamine derivatives. Studies with human liver P450s also indicate that P450 1A2 plays a major role in such reactions, although some arylamines such as 4,4'-methylene-bis (3-chloroaniline) and dapsone are preferentially N-oxygenated by P450 3A4. Caffeine N3-demethylation has been developed as a useful marker of P450 1A2 levels in humans; the knowledge that P450 1A2 is the major phenacetin O-deethylase also allows insight into previous human interaction studies. 2-Ethynylnaphthalene is a useful mechanism-based inactivator of rat and rabbit P450 1A2 but not human P450 1A2 enzymes; the peptides labeled in the enzymes have been identified, along with the region in rat P450 1A2 that is modified with the photoaffinity label 4-azidobiphenyl. Microcrystals of rabbit P450 1A2 have been obtained as a first course to realizing the three-dimensional structures of these enzymes. Evidence is also presented that the major C8-guanyl DNA adducts resulting from these arylamines and heterocyclic amines in DNA may be formed via rearrangement of an initial N7-guanyl-2-arylamine adduct: reaction of N-acetoxy-2-aminofluorene with C8-methylguanine derivatives led to the formation of stable N7-substituted species, and reaction of N-acetoxy-2-aminofluorene with C8-bromoguanine yielded N-(C8-guanosinyl)-2-aminofluorene in a reaction best rationalized by such a mechanism.","amine; carcinogen; cytochrome P450 1A2; guanine; heterocyclic compound; mutagenic agent; amino acid sequence; animal; biotransformation; chemistry; DNA adduct; enzyme specificity; human; metabolism; molecular genetics; rabbit; rat; review; sequence homology; Amines; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Biotransformation; Carcinogens; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2; DNA Adducts; Guanine; Heterocyclic Compounds; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagens; Rabbits; Rats; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Substrate Specificity"

In Escherichia coli, the key events of this cycle are the initiation of DNA replication, nucleoid segregation and the initiation of cell division. The replication initiator is the DnaA protein. In nucleoid segregation, the MukB protein, required for proper partitioning, may be a member of the myosin‐kinesin superfamily of mechanoenzymes. In cell division, the FtsZ protein has a tubulin motif, is a GTPase and polymerizes in a ring around midcell during septation; the FtsA protein has an actin‐like structure. The nature of the internal signals triggering these events is not known but candidates include cell mass, the superhelical density of the chromosome and the concentration of two regulatory nucleotides, cyclic AMP and ppGpp. The involvement of cytoskeletal‐like proteins in key cycle events encourages the notion of a fundamental biological unity in cell cycle regulation in all organisms.

Despite the absence of significant similarity of their amino acid sequences, both proteins share the same core architecture and a common nucleotide binding site resembling the structure of hexokinase. All three are ATPases or kinases and bind ATP in association with Mg2+ or Ca2+. The common fold consists of two α/β domains, which are connected by a putative hinge with an ATP-binding site situated between the domains. Each domain contains a five-stranded β-sheet of identical topology, which suggests that the molecules may have evolved by gene duplication. From a comparison of the three aligned structures, a fingerprint sequence of the adenine nucleotide binding pocket was derived, which predicted that members of the glycerol kinase family should also have a similar fold of their nucleotide binding domain. This was later confirmed when the X-ray structure was published. Data base search with a refined consensus sequence has retrieved other sugar kinases, as well as the prokaryotic cell cycle proteins FtsA, MreB, and StbA, and two Escherichia coli phosphatases. These proteins are predicted to possess a structure similar to actin in the common core region. As exemplified for actin, Hsc70, and glycerol kinase, the diversity of biological function is provided by the polymorphism of the loops joining the β-strands and helices in the core region and by inserted domains that show high variability.","8 bromo cyclic AMP; actin; adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphatase; adenosine triphosphate; calcium; glucosamine derivative; glycerol kinase; glycerophosphate; heat shock protein; hexokinase; magnesium; phosphatase; zinc; binding site; crystal structure; DNA fingerprinting; priority journal; protein domain; protein folding; protein polymorphism; protein structure; review; sequence homology; X ray analysis; Escherichia coli; Prokaryota"

Data sources and selection criteria: Relevant original papers and review articles mainly of the English-written literature. Results: Besides their major role in hemostasis and wound healing, blood platelets are involved in immunological reactions. They are not only able to interact with IgG through Fc receptors (FcR), they also react with complement components. This review summarizes interactions of complement with mainly human platelets. Such interactions may occur through complement receptors of the plasma membrane (e. g. C1q receptor, complement receptors 2 and 4), but also in a receptor-independent way including activation of the platelet by the membrane attack complex of complement C5b-9. In addition, activation of complement at the surface of the platelets may be induced after binding of anti-platelet antibodies to membrane glycoproteins (e.g. GpIIb/IIIa, GpIb/IX) or after binding of platelet-nonspecific immune complexes via FcR. Complement activation in turn may be regulated by various means including specific plasma or membrane proteins [e.g. decay-accelerating factor (DAF), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL), C8-binding protein (C8bp, homologous restriction factor hrf)]. As a further way of self-protection against complement attack, platelets may actively release C5b-9, deposited at the surface as C5b-9-enriched membrane vesicles. Conclusions: Two lines of interaction of platelet with complement can be distinguished. On the one hand, platelets are equipped with membrane proteins which protect them from complement attack against themselves. On the other hand, membrane receptors for activated complement components as well as for IgG are expressed on the surface, which enable the platelet to intervene in immunological reactions. This property varies between platelets of different species and needs further investigation also in view of the platelet as an intersection between immunology and hemostasis.","immunoglobulin G; complement system; human; immunoreactivity; review; thrombocyte"

Leukocyte reduction has not proved effective, however, in preventing febrile reactions after platelet transfusions in alloimmunized patients. To reduce the risk of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, new recommendations for the irradiation of blood components have been made. They include the irradiation of donor units from all blood relatives of the recipient and an increase in the recommended dose of irradiation to 2,500 cGy. Current investigations of both hemoglobin-based and fluorocarbon-based blood substitutes may improve the safety and efficacy of transfusion therapy in the future.

In the attempt to replace this function, two lines of investigation were followed. Gas transport using of hemoglobin involves saturable physicochemical mechanisms. The affinity of human ""stroma-free"" hemoglobin for oxygen is too high, hampering the release of oxygen in tissue. The binding of oxygen to stroma-free hemoglobin can be improved by coupling of hemoglobin to pyridoxal phosphate. By cross-linking with, for example, dialdehydes (particularly glutaraldehyde) the production of hemoglobin molecules of higher molecular weight and greater stability is possible. However, first trials in humans using these preparations fall short of expectations. The stability of the polymers and of the preparations was not as good as expected. Another possibility is the use of water-insoluble fluorocarbons (perfluorocarbons), which have a high capacity for physical gas transport. The disadvantage of using emulsions of these substances is the necessity for high partial oxygen pressure to attain sufficient gas transport. The complete insolubility in water impedes the use of the metabolic inert fluorocarbons, because they can only be eliminated via the lungs. Despite these problems the fluorocarbons have been extensively used in humans. In the USA the use of some emulsions is allowed for special indications. Extended clinical use of fluorocarbons and of hemoglobin derivates cannot be expected in the near future. Substitution of the blood hydrocolloid albumin has been practiced for many years, synthetic hydrocolloids being used to replace the colloid osmotic pressure of albumin and also to decrease the blood viscosity by hemodilution and hence improve flow. In Germany hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is the most-used hydrocolloid with the least side effects. Anaphylactic reactions restrict the use of dextran, and gelatin derivatives, because of their short half-life, are not of clinical importance in Germany. Hydrocolloids with a half-life of 3-6 h (dextran 40, middle-substituted HES) are preferred, while those with a half-life of about 20-30 h (dextran 60/70, highly substituted HES) are infrequently used.","blood substitute; oxygen; bleeding; blood; electrolyte balance; erythrocyte; hemodilution; hemoglobin determination; human; methodology; pathophysiology; physiology; review; Blood Loss, Surgical; Blood Substitutes; Erythrocytes; Hemodilution; Hemoglobinometry; Humans; Oxygen; Water-Electrolyte Balance"

Therefore, the possible advantages of a synthetic meniscal substitute over allografts, such as availability and freedom from disease transmission, are overshadowed by factors such as sizing problems, inferior material properties and wear. Using some of the available materials, such as Dacron and Teflon, knee joint stability with intact cruciate ligaments seems to be a basic requirement for the incorporation and fixation of the synthetic material into the biological environment. Similar to using allografts or biological implants, normal posterior and anterior attachment sites could not be reconstructed with the synthetic materials, which may be one of the main causes of insufficient cartilage preservation after meniscal substitution. Further, it was shown that synthetic implants without a polyurethane coating failed because of wear and changes in shape; meanwhile the coated, more inflexible implants often caused osteophyte formation and synovitis. In conclusion, with the materials and designs tested the concept of a permanent meniscal prosthesis does not seem clinically applicable at the moment. Nevertheless, the beneficial effects on cartilage preservation which were seen with slight improvements in prosthesis size, design and material properties may point to a future potential for this concept. © 1994.","biomaterial; dacron; politef; polyurethan; allograft; biocompatibility; disease transmission; endoprosthesis; joint stability; knee; knee cruciate ligament; knee meniscus; osteophyte; priority journal; review; surgical technique; synovitis; Animal; Biocompatible Materials; Human; Knee Prosthesis; Menisci, Tibial; Polyethylene Terephthalates; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Synovitis"

Essentially the early phase of prosthetic incorporation (phase I) includes exudative inflammatory reactions as part of acute inflammatory processes. The degree of order within the tissue architecture and the mutual influence of matrix and cells in the reaction appeared to be slight. The cellular infiltrate found on the outer prosthetic surface is of local origin whereas the inner prosthetic lining contains cells of haematogenous origin. The organisation phase (phase II), which is comparable to the reparative-proliferative phase of an inflammatory reaction, showed activation of the reticulo-endothelial system together with the start of phagocytosis and a thinning of the prosthetic structures. Collagen type I and type III and fibronectin served both as a guidance and a growth tract for the cells during the cellular permeation of the prosthesis. Fibronectin and collagen type III have a special ""catalytic"" function. Collagen type I causes the firm anchoring of the vascular prosthesis in the periprosthetic tissue. The loss of stability of the prosthesis due to phagocytosis of fibres is balanced by the newly formed connective tissue within the wall of the vessel. The fibroblasts involved in the organisation must be derived from the flowing blood and from local mesenchymal cells. A chronic inflammatory reaction persisted during the late phase. In some cases increased proliferation of the inner mesenchymal lining of the prosthesis was observed together with regressive changes. The lack of a continuous surrounding stromal architecture on the luminal side of the vessel can be regarded as the main reason for this proliferation. Transformation of haematogenous cells into angioblasts or endothelial cells was not seen. Small endothelialised areas were only seen in the vicinity of anastomoses and following transprosthetic permeation by capillaries.","blood vessel prosthesis; human; prosthesis; review; Blood Vessel Prosthesis; Humans; Prosthesis Design; MLCS; MLOWN"

This review highlights much of the literature on ocular trauma from the previous year and discusses the merits of current and future approaches to surgical intervention.","aminoglycoside antibiotic agent; antibiotic agent; cefazolin; ceftazidime; chondroitin ABC lyase; clindamycin; fluorocarbon; gentamicin; perfluorophenanthrene; plasmin; retinoic acid; silicone oil; vancomycin; antibiotic prophylaxis; clinical trial; endophthalmitis; eye injury; human; intraocular foreign body; intravenous drug administration; intravitreal drug administration; nonhuman; priority journal; retina detachment; review; tampon; topical drug administration; vitrectomy; vitreous hemorrhage"

A distinct F VIII immunoreactivity of vessels endothelium was recorded since a 1 day old newborn. Lectin immunoreactivity suggested the increased vascularization of the undergoing myelination spinal cord tracts. In the postnatal period, which was characterized morphologically by the nearly completed myelination, the spinal white matter appeared poorly vascularized. A temporary increase of spinal cord tract vascularization during myelination is probably caused by local secretion of angiogenic factors. It is possible that their source might be young developing myelin.","animal; astrocyte; blood vessel; child development; hamster; histology; human; infant; myelin sheath; newborn; physiology; prenatal development; preschool child; pyramidal tract; review; spinal cord; vascularization; Animals; Astrocytes; Blood Vessels; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Cricetinae; Embryonic and Fetal Development; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Myelin Sheath; Pyramidal Tracts; Spinal Cord"

The wire‐guided sphincterotome allows the endoscopist to maintain direct access to the biliary tree before or after the sphincterotomy. It has the additional advantages of allowing for more expeditious placement of accessories and being useful in combined percutaneous‐endoscopic procedures. There are two basic designs of wire‐guided sphincterotomes. The single‐channel model has a single lumen for both the cutting wire and guidewire and requires guidewire removal before the application of power. The double‐channel model has two separate lumens for the guidewire and stainless steel cutting wire. In vitro data suggest that significant capacitive coupling currents (or short circuits) may occur on the standard Teflon‐coated guidewire when used with a double lumen sphincterotome, resulting in elec‐trosurgical burns. Thus, the manufacturers of the double‐lumen models recommend removing the Teflon‐coated wire before performing sphincterotomy. Although limited data in humans have been publisbed, it appears that wire‐guided sphincterotomy and standard sphincterotomy have similar complication rates.

As it is not known why the strictly controlled C system starts to react against autologous heart tissue, we have analyzed the expression of various membrane regulators of C (CR1, DAF, MCP, CD59, C8 binding protein) and the pattern of deposition of C components and plasma C regulators (C4b binding protein and vitronectin) in normal (n = 7) and infarcted (n = 13) human myocardium. In the infarcted myocardium deposits of the C membrane attack complex (MAC) were observed by immunofluorescence microscopy, and lesions resembling the transmembrane channels of MAC were detected by transmission electron microscopy. CD59 and C8 binding protein were strongly expressed by muscle cells of normal myocardial tissue. Little or no CR1, MCP, and DAF was observed on these cells. The assembly of MAC was accompanied by the deposition of vitronectin (S-protein) and C4b binding protein in the infarcted areas of myocardium. In accordance with our earlier results the expression of CD59 but not of C8 binding protein was clearly diminished in the lesions. The results show that C8 binding protein, vitronectin, and C4b binding protein do not prevent complement attack against the infarcted myocardium but rather become codeposited with the MAC. Ischemia-induced transformation of nonviable cells into complement activators, acquired loss of resistance to the MAC by shedding of CD59, and recruitment of multifunctional serum proteins by MAC could thus constitute a general process aimed at the clearance of injured tissue.","binding protein; cd59 antigen; complement component c4b; complement membrane attack complex; regulator protein; vitronectin; antigen expression; cell transformation; complement activation; complex formation; heart infarction; human; human tissue; immunofluorescence microscopy; immunohistochemistry; membrane channel; priority journal; review; transmission electron microscopy; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Complement C4; Complement Membrane Attack Complex; Female; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Glycoproteins; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Immunohistochemistry; Macrophage Activation; Male; Microscopy, Electron; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Sarcolemma; Time Factors; Vitronectin"

Indoor air models, in turn, are incorporated into the structure of total human exposure models. Fragmentary data on residential ventilation rates are available in various governmental reports, journal articles, and contractor reports. Most of the published papers present data on only a few homes to answer very specialized questions, and none of these publications summarize the ventilation rates of a large population of homes across the United States. Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has conducted more than 4000 residential perfluorocarbon tracer (PFT) measurements and brought them together into a large data base from about 100 studies in the United States and elsewhere. This paper analyzes the BNL PFT data base to generate frequency distributions and summary statistics for different regions of the United States, different seasons, and different levels within the homes. The data analyses suggest that residential ventilation rates are similar in the northeastern and northwestern states but higher in the southwestern states. Winter and fall ventilation rates are similar, but the rates are slightly higher in spring, and much higher in summer. Multi-level residences have higher air exchange rates than single-level residences. Although the BNL data are not a representative sample of homes in the United States, these analyses give insight into the range of air exchange rates found in the United States under a great variety of conditions and are intended for use by developers of models of indoor air quality and total human exposure.","air conditioning; biological model; environmental exposure; human; indoor air pollution; review; season; standard; statistics; United States; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Models, Biological; Seasons; United States; Ventilation"

Initiation requires ATP-bound DnaA protein, together with replication proteins. Replication is followed by decatenation and monomerization of sister-chromosome molecules. Sister chromosomes are rapidly partitioned into opposite halves of the cell, perhaps by a kinesin-like protein (MukB). Cytokinesis starts with the formation of a ring of a CTP-binding protein (FtsZ), usually around the cell center. A specific enzyme (PBP3) and other proteins (FtsQ, FtsA, FtsL, FtsW) are responsible for the coordinate ingrowth of the peptidoglycan cell wall at this location. EnvA protein is required to split the resultant cross-wall to form new cell poles. The formation of the FtsZ ring is inhibited by activated MinC protein, but the MinE protein reverses this inhibition at potential division sites. A minimum cell length is probably required for partition and a minimum-size DNA-free zone for septum formation.","cell cycle; cell division; DNA replication; Escherichia coli; nonhuman; priority journal; review; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli"

The dysfunction appears to be triggered within 2.5 min of the endothelial generation of a large burst of superoxide radicals (40, 76, 117). However, the initial dysfunction may be amplified by neutrophil-generated factors including oxygen-derived free radicals, cytokines, proteases, and lipid mediators. Moreover, adhesive molecules on the surface of the PMN, along with their ligands on the endothelial cell membrane, appear to promote endothelial dysfunction in ways that may go beyond the adherence of neutrophils on the endothelial surface. These interactions remain to be elucidated but may involve intricate cell signaling pathways. A variety of pharmacologic agents exert endothelial protective effects in ischemia-reperfusion and circulatory shock states. Table 1 summarizes these agents and indicates the major mechanism of preservation of the endothelium. These substances can be classified into three broad categories: (a) substances replacing endogenous cytoprotective agents of endothelial origin including prostacyclin (PGI2), endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), and adenosine: the endothelium protecting agents include these substances as well as stable analogs of PGI2, and nitric oxide donors; (b) substances that inhibit pro-inflammatory mediators of endothelial origin: the pro-inflammatory agents are primarily platelet activating factor (PAF) and oxygen-derived free radicals (e.g. superoxide radicals) although other mediators may be involved. The therapeutic agents useful in this area are PAF receptor antagonists and free radical scavengers (e.g. superoxide dismutase); (c) substances that inhibit neutrophils or neutrophil-derived mediators: the major neutrophil-derived mediators are oxygen-derived free radicals, cytokines (e.g. TNFα and IL-1β), proteases (e.g. elastase), and lipid mediators (e.g. LTB4). In addition, adhesive molecules on the neutrophil surface and their endothelial ligands promote endothelial dysfunction and the action of adherent neutrophils. Agents that inhibit some of these mediators are transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), elastase inhibitors, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) receptor antagonists and monoclonal antibodies to adhesive proteins (e.g. anti-CD18, anti-ICAM-1). Further work is needed to clarify these findings and to determine the physiolsogic and pathophysiologic interactions among these diverse agents. This topic of endothelial dysfunction represents a fertile area for further investigation to elucidate the complex mechanisms of neutrophil-endothelial interactions. These interactions lead to neutrophil adherence to the endothelium, neutrophil migration into the underlying tissues, and subsequent tissue injury (e.g. myocardial reperfusion injury). Understanding these mechanisms will provide important insight into the pathophysiologic proceses of reperfusion injury as well as offer important targets for therapeutic intervention in these important disease states.","acetylcholine; adenosine; antibody; cardiovascular agent; CD18 antigen; cytokine; defibrotide; free radical; glyceryl trinitrate; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; leukotriene B4 receptor antagonist; leukotriene receptor blocking agent; lipoxygenase inhibitor; nitric oxide; perfluoro compound; prostacyclin; proteinase; sodium nitrite; superoxide; superoxide dismutase; taprostene; thrombocyte activating factor antagonist; thromboxane synthase inhibitor; transforming growth factor beta; cell protection; ischemia; neutrophil; nonhuman; priority journal; reperfusion injury; review; shock; vascular endothelium; Lethrinidae"

In fact, only the unusual patient appears to achieve optimal reperfusion for acute myocardial infarction, with a substantial deterioration of benefit in many patients due to insufficiently early or rapid recanalization, incomplete patency with TIMI grade 2 flow or critical residual coronary stenoses, absence of myocardial tissue reflow despite epicardial artery patency, intermittent coronary patency, subsequent reocclusion, or reperfusion injury.

The most advanced scopes are related to hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbons emulsions. The limitations of free hemoglobin impose to modify it. The reestablishment of a normal, even reduced, affinity for oxygen is obtained by the fixation on hemoglobin of a 2,3-DPG substitute whose most known example is pyridoxal phosphate. The enhancement of vascular retention may be achieved by intramolecular cross-linking, intermolecular polymerization or covalent binding of hemoglobin on macromolecules. The two modifications of hemoglobin must be performned successively at numerous possibilities have been proposed. Bovine and recombinant hemoglobins are also promising.

The physical properties of these molecules, impose, for transfusion, their emulsification in an aqueous physiological solution. They need an oxygen enriched atmosphere and their storage in tissues is often extended. At present, the most known emulsion is Fluosol DA, a mixture of perfluorodecalin and perfluorotripropylamine. It allowed to realize numerous researchs and the proposal of the multiple possible employments for this category of oxygen carriers. The limitations of Fluosol DA led to fluorocarbons under investigation such as F dimethyl bicyclononanes, F methyladamantane, bis (F-butyl) ethene or F-octylbromide. The new hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbons emulsions start to meet the requirements of potential users.","fluorocarbon; hemoglobin; pyridoxal 5 phosphate; blood transfusion; human; oxygen transport; review; Blood Substitutes; Blood Transfusion; Drug Carriers; English Abstract; Fluorocarbons; Hemoglobins; In Vitro; Oxygen"

Cigarette smoke produces cancer, emphysema, and other diseases after a delay of years. Acute exposure to smoke in a fire can produce a loss of lung function and death after a delay of days or weeks. Tobacco smoke and the smoke inhaled in a burning building have some similarities from a chemical viewpoint. For example, both contain high concentrations of CO and other combustion products. In addition, both contain high concentrations of free radicals, and our laboratory has studied these free radicals, largely by electron spin resonance (ESR) methods, for about 15 years. This article reviews what is known about the radicals present in these different types of smokes and soots and tars and summarizes the evidence that suggests these radicals could be involved in cigarette-induced pathology and smoke-inhalation deaths. The combustion of all organic materials produces radicals, but (with the exception of the smoke from perfluoropolymers) the radicals that are detected by ESR methods (and thus the radicals that would reach the lungs) are not those that arise in the combustion process. Rather they arise from chemical reactions that occur in the smoke itself. Thus, a knowledge of the chemistry of the smoke is necessary to understand the nature of the radicals formed. Even materials as similar as cigarettes and wood (cellulose) produce smoke that contains radicals with very different lifetimes and chemical characteristics, and mechanistic rationales for this are discussed. Cigarette tar contains a semiquinone radical that is infinitely stable and can be directly observed by ESR. Aqueous extracts of cigarette tar, which contain this radical, reduce oxygen to superoxide and thus produce both hydrogen peroxide and the hydroxyl radical. These solutions both oxidize alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor (a1PI) and nick DNA. Because of the potential role of radicals in smoke-inhalation injury, we suggest that antioxidant therapy (such as use of an inhaler for persons brought out of a burning building) might prove efficacious. © 1992.","cigarette smoke; free radical; lung injury; priority journal; review; Comparative Study; DNA Damage; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Fires; Free Radicals; Human; Plants, Toxic; Plastics; Smoke; Smoke Inhalation Injury; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Tobacco; Wood; Nicotiana tabacum"

The approval of Fluosol, a fluorocarbon emulsion for oxygenating the myocardium during the transluminal coronary angioplasty procedure, is a landmark in the field of injectable oxygen carriers, the so‐called blood substitutes. This review discusses the advances made since this first emulsion was initially developed about 12 years ago. Attention is focused on the progress achieved in the preparation and selection of new, better‐defined and faster‐excreted fluorocarbons, and better surfactants, improved emulsions, knowledge of structure/property relationships along with an improved understanding of the physiologic response to their administration. These advances have led to the development of a second generation of highly concentrated, fluid and stable injectable oxygen carriers suitable for a broad range of clinical applications. Prospects for further progress and future generations of emulsions are also outlined. © 1991 S.

Issues explored include loss of patency, development of phlebitis, duration of lock placement, type of cannula material, sample size, risk of toxicity with heparin flush solutions, risk of clot embolism, and physical or chemical incompatibilities. Available studies indicate that heparin is not necessary to maintain fluoroethylenepropylene (FEP-Teflon) peripheral venous access devices unless the lock is used to obtain blood specimens. Considering the benefit-to-risk ratio for the use of heparin, it is advisable to maintain FEP-Teflon locks with normal saline alone. When locks are used to obtain blood specimens, as in a pharmacokinetic study, then a dilute heparin flush solution should be used. Whether heparin is necessary for the maintenance of locks composed of other materials is uncertain. Newer, less thrombogenic materials such as ethylene tetrafluoroethylene may also obviate the need for heparin, but comparative trials in a larger number of patients are needed for confirmation. When heparin is used, an effort should be made to avoid systemic toxicities by using the lowest known effective concentration (10 units/mL) pending further studies. © 1991, SAGE Publications.

Recent advances in the development and assessment of synthetic oxygen transport fluids based on perfluorochemicals (PFCs) are reviewed. The basic properties of PFCs are outlined, together with the selection criteria for biomedical applications. PFCs must be emulsified for intravascular use and attention is focussed on the formulation and biocompatibility testing of both first‐ and second‐generation emulsions and their components in man and other species. The multidisciplinary applications for PFCs in medicine and basic biomedical research are described, including the clinical use of Fluosol‐DA 20% as an oxygen‐carrying perfusate in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. © 1991 S.

For instance, these new compounds are stable and do not need to be frozen, but can be stored in the liquid state; they have an increased fluorocarbon concentration without increased viscosity, but with a higher O2-delivering capacity; they have a longer intravascular persistence, but a shorter retention time in organs; free from Pluronic F-68 and prepared with new synthetic surfactants or natural lecithins, they do not produce adverse reactions due to complement activation...

Several methods have been developed to measure P(i), all measuring the fluid equilibration pressure, i.e., the pressure in a saline-filled tube brought into contact with the interstitium. The methods designed to establish such contact may be characterized as acute and chronic. With acute methods, i.e., needle without infusion, wick catheters, WIN, and micropipettes, measurements are made within minutes to a few hours after insertion of the device. The chronic methods are various capsules (perforated, porous, or Teflon® rings) implanted into the tissue 4 to 6 weeks before measurements. A general finding in previous studies from different laboratories and in different species have been that the chronic methods give more strongly negative (subatmospheric) P(i) than the acute methods, and that the chronic methods give much greater pressure responses to changes in IFV. By direct comparison of acute and chronic methods in the same tissue and site, all give similar P(i) in steady state conditions, while an acute over- and dehydration results in far more pronounced pressure changes recorded with chronic than with acute devices. It is proposed that these transient pressure differences recorded by acute vs. chronic methods result from different physical properties of the capsule lining compared with that of the surrounding skin, in addition to a possible osmometer effect of the capsule lining. Recent data show that such methodological problems have resulted in great variation in the estimation of compliance of the interstitium and have overemphasized the importance of P(i) as an edema-preventing mechanism. In conclusion, no ideal all-purpose method is available for the measurement of P(i). A given technique should be tested against other methods in the same tissue, site, and species in which it is intended to be used. If possible, comparison should be made with micropipette measurements.In this review, the author gives a detailed description of the methods for Pi measurement and their performance in steady state and during changes in tissue hydration. Since most studies have been on skin/subcutaneous tissue and to a somewhat less extent also on skeletal muscle, the author focuses on these tissues and only briefly considers other tissues. A discussion is also presented interstitial compliance, i.e., the relationship between change in IFV and Pi during alterations in tissue hydration, and how this parameter is affected by the method for Pi measurement. Finally, the author considers the importance of Pi and other factors in edema prevention.","Biomedical Engineering--Surgical Implants; Edema; Implanted Porous Capsules; Interstitial Compliance; Interstitial Fluid Pressure; Interstitial Fluid Volume; Wick Catheter Technique; Biological Materials; methodology; physiology; review; tissue pressure; Animal; Compliance; Equipment Design; Extracellular Space; Human; Hydrostatic Pressure; Manometry; Osmotic Pressure; Prostheses and Implants; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Infectious flacherie virus"

Organofluorine compounds often show unique properties [1], and are widely used as medicines, pesticides, dyes or surfactants. Especially the substitution by perfluoroalkyl group at particular positions of organic compounds may give rise to unique physical or biological properties which cannot be achieved by incorporating other functional groups. However, the methods for the introduction of perfluoroalkyl groups into organic compounds have not yet been well established. Although nucleophilic substitution via cationic intermediates is the most important and common reaction in hydrocarbon chemistry, the generation of perfluoroalkyl cationic intermediates is very difficult due to the strong electronegativity of fluorine [2] (Scheme 1).{A figure is presented}. © 1990.",

The major clinical manifestation of PNH is chronic intravascular hemolysis of various severity. Patients-mostly young adults - may also present with episodes of abdominal or back pain. Common cause of death is thrombosis especially of the hepatic veins. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia may be the initial manifestation of PNH, indicating that the disorder is a primary bone-marrow disease, affecting not only the erythrocytes but also other peripheral blood cells and the haematopoietic stem cell. The course of the disease is variable. Partial complete recovery was described, but also fatal thrombosis. The major phenotypic expression of PNH is an increased susceptibility of the erythrocytes to the lytic action of complement in vitro. The enhanced complement susceptibility is most probably due to membrane defects: two membrane proteins regulating the complement cascade in PNH cells were missing, the decay-accelerating factor, DAF, inhibiting the activation of the lytic complement complex and the C8 binding protein, C8bp, which interferes with the lytic process. Aside from the lack of the complement regulators also other membrane defects have been described (e.g. of acetylcholinesterase or alkaline phosphatase). The proteins as well as DAF and C8bp are linked to the cell membrane via a phosphatidylinositol (PI) anchor, leading to the speculation that the disease results from a deficiency in the posttranslational PI anchoring mechanism. The diagnosis of PNH is based on the Hamtest, but will be extended to the quantitation of the above described membrane proteins. Therapy of PNH is restricted to treatment of symptoms: Transfusion of washed erythrocytesnecessary when the hemoglobin level is critically low, iron supplementation, or in cases of thrombosis anticoagulans. Ideal treatment of PNH would be a replacement of the abnormal stem cells by bone-marrow transplantation. Due to its limitations bone-marrow transplantation have been done only in a few cases. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.","androgen; complement; iron; prednisone; complement; hemoglobinemia; hemoglobinuria; human; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; priority journal; review; differential diagnosis; erythrocyte; immunology; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; physiology; Complement; Diagnosis, Differential; English Abstract; Erythrocytes; Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal; Human"

Initial metabolism occurs primarily in the liver and involves N-hydroxylation by cytochrome P-450IA2 and N-acetylation by acetyltransferase, which serve as competing activation and detoxification reactions, respectively. Both enzymes are polymorphic in humans and individual phenotype can be readily assessed using caffeine ingested in coffee followed by urinary metabolite analysis. N-hydroxy arylamines can then be transported through the blood where they can form protein adducts with hemoglobin or undergo renal filtration into the urinary bladder lumen where, at acidic pH, they can react covalently with urothelial DNA. Carcinogen-DNA adduct levels in human bladder are smoking-related and the C8-deoxyguanosine derivative of 4-amino-biphenyl (ABP) is a major product. Alternatively, N-hydroxy arylamines can be conjugated in the liver by glucuronyl transferases which provides a mechanism for biliary transport to the colon lumen where beta-glucuronidases can regenerate the aglycone. In the colon mucosa, acetyltransferases can further activate the N-hydroxy metabolite by O-acetylation; and persons with the rapid acetylation phenotype are known to be at higher risk for colorectal cancer. Detection of specific arylamine-DNA adducts in human colon should provide direct evidence for the role of these carcinogens in the etiology of this disease.","acyltransferase; amine; cytochrome P450; DNA; bladder tumor; chemically induced disorder; colorectal tumor; DNA damage; drug effect; enzymology; human; intestine; liver; metabolism; physiology; review; smoking; Acetyltransferases; Amines; Colorectal Neoplasms; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; DNA; DNA Damage; Humans; Intestines; Liver; Smoking; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"

They are composed of 3-hydroxyacid monomer units and exist as a small number of cytoplasmic granules per cell. The properties of the C4 homopolymer PHB as a biodegradable thermoplastic first attracted industrial attention more than 20 years ago. Copolymers of C4 (3-hydroxybutyrate [3HB] and C5 (3-hydroxyvalerate [3HV]) monomer units have modified physical properties; e.g., the plastic is less brittle than PHB, whereas PHAs containing C8 to C12 monomers behave as elastomers. This family of materials is the centre of considerable commercial interest, and 3HB-co-3HV copolymers have been marketed by ICI plc as Biopol. The known polymers exist as 21 helices with the fiber repeat decreasing from 0.596 nm for PHB to about 0.45 nm for C8 to C10 polymers. Novel copolymers with a backbone of 3HB and 4HB have been obtained. The native granules contain noncrystalline polymer, and water may possibly act as a plasticizer. Although the biosynthesis and regulation of PHB are generally well understood, the corresponding information for the synthesis of long-side-chain PHAs from alkanes, alcohols, and organic acids is still incomplete. The precise mechanisms of action of the polymerizing and depolymerizing enzymes also remain to be established. The structural genes for the three key enzymes of PHB synthesis from acetyl coenzyme A in Alcaligenes eutrophus have been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. Polymer molecular weights appear to be species specific. The factors influencing the commercial choice of organism, substrate, and isolation process are discussed.

When the carrier system contains emulsified lipids, typical production steps may encompass premixing of raw materials including the drug, high-energy homogenization, filtration and filling of bottles followed by heat sterilization. This procedure is defined as drug incorporation de novo, in contrast to extemporaneous addition of a drug to a pre-formed emulsion. Changes in concentration or chemical composition of raw materials, including the pharmaceutically active ingredient, or changes in process conditions, including time, temperature and pressure, may have profound effects on physical properties and stability of the final product. Careful characterization of these properties is essential in order to minimize toxicity of the carrier system and optimize drug efficacy. First-generation drug emulsions, which are either in clinical trials or are being marketed, include Amphotericin B, Diazemuls®, Vitalipid®, prostaglandin E1 and Diprivan®. Second-generation formulations, which are currently being developed and evaluated, incorporate cytotoxics such as Perilla ketone, Penclomedine and taxol or anesthetics such as halothane or pregnanolone. Other types of drug emulsions under development include perfluorocarbons for oxygen delivery and lipophilic carriers for radiopaque contrast agents.

The introduction of bronchoalveolar lavage as a diagnostic tool in pneumology and the use of monoclonal antibodies have afforded considerable advances in pathogenic studies on this clinical entity. In the present work we review the characteristics of bronchoalveolar lavage in patients suffering from hypersensitivity pneumonitis in order to study the mechanisms through which the disease appears after integrating such characteristics with the classical histological, clinical and biochemical data. Bronchoalveolar lavage in these patients demonstrates the following: An elevation in the number of total cells that is higher than in any other interstitial pathology. Morphological, biochemical and functional data suggestive of activation of alveolar macrophages. An elevation in lymphocyte percentages with data characteristic of activation. The rise occurs in the two lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4 and CD8), although there is a predominance, in the rise in C8 lymphocytes, such that the CD4/CD8 ratio decreases. A rise is also observed in ""natural killer"" cells. Functionally, there are data that reveal an increase in the inducer potential of T lymphocytes together with an increase in cytotoxic capacity, in all their subpopulations. The results on the lymphocyte count vary broadly according to the course of the disease. Varying increases in neutrophils, eosinophils and mast cells. The rises in the first two kinds of cells indicate recent contact with the antigen, while the rise in mast cells seems to be of pathogenic significance.

After passing the ganglion stellatum and neighbouring ganglia, the nerves enter the dorsal horn of the spinal cord at C8-Th9 (especially Th2-Th6). Here the nerve synapses for the first time, mainly to neurons which run up to the thalamus contralaterally by the tractus spinothalamicus. Apart from atypically localised pain (jaw, head, neck), the nervus vagus is rarely involved in transmitting agina pectoris pain. There is no close relation between peripheral pain localisation and localisation of coronary stenosis or myocardial ischemia areas. The localisation of angina pectoris is decided by viscero-somatic summation (convergence-projection-theory). Almost all the ascending tracts of the tractus spinothalamicus with visceral inflow also receive inflow from somatic afferences, from skin areas of the dermatome from the same segment level, and especially from deep somatic structures such as muscle and ligaments (Head's zones). Additional reflex mechanisms, where the efferent part is probably sympathetic, explain transferred effects in the matching dermatome such as hypothermic skin zones, cutaneous hyperalgesia, higher pressure sensitivity of the muscles and occasionally even dystrophic changes. The amount of spinal visceral afferences is relatively small (only 1.5-2.5% of all somatic spinal afferences). The low amount, the pronounced divergence and, compared to converging somatic afferences, the larger receptive fields in the organ explain the diffuse, barely localisable character of angina pectoris pain. Cardiac afferences are tonically and phasically inhibited at spinal and supraspinal levels, especially by descending tracts. This explains why angina pectoris can be missing in spite of pronounced peripheral nociceptive impulse rates. Patients with silent myocardial ischemia have a higher central pain threshold than patients with symptomatic myocardial ischemia. Endogenous opioids are involved in the body's own analgesia system. The beta-endorphin level in the serum rises significantly in many patients during exercise diagnostic tests. Patients with silent myocardial ischemia have higher beta-endorphin levels compared to symptomatic patients at the same exercise level. This can be interpreted as expressing quantitative differences in a superior pain regulation system. Myocardial ischemia is experienced as angina pectoris pain when the peripheral nociceptive impulse rate is so pronounced that the prevailing inhibitory pain threshold can be overcome and when the pain pathways are intact.","beta endorphin; adult; aged; angina pectoris; female; human; ischemia; male; nociception; priority journal; review; sympathetic nerve; Angina Pectoris; Animal; English Abstract; Human; Nociceptors; Peripheral Nerves; Skin; Spinal Cord; Spinothalamic Tracts"

Hypoxic zones targeted as cells within them may be radiation resistant, poorly perfused by chemotherapeutic agents, and possibly drug resistant due to hypoxia-related gene amplification. Nitroimidazoles have gained particular attention as chemical modifiers because they can increase the radiation sensitivity of hypoxic cells, are cytotoxic to hypoxic cells, can increase sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, and are useful for imaging hypoxic cells. While both radiosensitization and chemosensitization require hypoxia, the mechanism of the enhancement of each of the modalities is different. The 2-nitroimidazole hypoxic sensitizers SR 2508 and Ro-03-8799, which are less toxic than the prototype misonidazole (Miso), are in clinical trials, and dual function molecules that include a hypoxic sensitizer and alkylating function are being developed. The presence of both acutely and chronically hypoxic cells in animal tumors has been demonstrated by new imaging techniques. Oxygen delivery to tumors is being altered by the use of perfluorocarbons, and agents that alter hemoglobin affinity for oxygen. Compounds that are selectively toxic to hypoxic cells are being developed. Nonhypoxic modifiers are also being investigated. Thiol modification, particularly the alteration of glutathione concentration, has complex effects on the cell's biochemistry, in addition to affecting the competition between oxygen and thiol groups for the restoration and fixation of radiation-induced radicals. WR-2721 is being studied as a means of reducing the normal tissue toxicity of radiation and chemotherapy. Increased thiol concentration may be a mechanism of cross-resistance between certain chemotherapeutic agents and radiation.","amifostine; etanidazole; misonidazole; pimonidazole; cancer therapy; drug sensitization; human; hypoxia; priority journal; radiosensitization; review"

The disadvantages of the former include the danger of overcorrection, tissue irritation and possible systemic absorption of the material. As an alternative, solid material such as cartilage or synthetics may be used for augmentation. Experience obtained so far has shown that chips of porous polyethylene (PHDPE) are particularly suitable: they are easy to use, show good tissue tolerance and are anchored by ingrowth of connective tissue. The value of photokymography of the larynx in the assessment of therapeutic results after vocal-fold augmentation is discussed.","collagen; paraffin; politef; polyethylene derivative; cartilage; female; follow up; human; injection; larynx disorder; larynx tumor; male; postoperative complication; prostheses and orthoses; review; transplantation; vocal cord; vocal cord paralysis; Cartilage; Collagen; English Abstract; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Human; Injections; Laryngeal Neoplasms; Male; Paraffin; Polyethylenes; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Postoperative Complications; Prostheses and Implants; Vocal Cord Paralysis; Vocal Cords; Voice Disorders"

HPLC chromatograms provide fast identification by retention time, tR, and precise quantitation by measurement of peak height or peak area. For separation of tetracycline compounds, most HPLC methods use reversed-phase C18 or C8 columns and UV detection. The HPLC solvent system should have a pH of about 6 to prevent steric changes in the tetracycline molecule. For accurate quantitation it is necessary to avoid tailing and this is accomplished by adding a zwitter ion to the solvent system. Methanol and acetonitrile are frequently used as organic modifiers in these solvent systems. In a single analysis, HPLC methods can be used to separate as many as nine or ten commercially used tetracycline compounds and to determine four to five tetracyclines in commercial tetracycline preparations or in biological fluids. © 1985 Friedr.

It is only for Factor B and Factor D of the alternative pathway that homozygous deficiency states are not so far known. Complement deficiency states provide the most direct way of looking at the role of the complement system in vivo and emphasize the importance of complement in resistance to bacterial infection and in particular to infection with Neisseria. This association is not unexpected since in vitro studies have shown complement to be an efficient enhancer of phagocytosis and inflammation. The particularly frequent occurrence of neisserial infection may be ascribed to the ability of these organisms to survive in phagocytic cells so that the plasma cytolytic activity provided by complement is needed to kill them. On the other hand the strong association between complement deficiencies and immune-complex diseases--especially systemic lupus erythematosus--was unexpected and seems paradoxical in view of the large part played by complement in the pathogenesis of immune complex mediated tissue damage. The paradox can be explained in part by the necessity for an intact complement system in the solubilization and the proper handling of immune complexes. It is also likely that complement deficiency can allow the persistence of low virulence organisms that produce disease solely by an immune complex mechanism. Recently described deficiencies of complement receptors and their effects in vivo are described.","complement; complement component C1s inhibitor; complement component C3b receptor; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement membrane attack complex; complement receptor; blood donor; genetics; hemolysis; human; immune complex disease; immune deficiency; immunology; meningococcosis; physiology; review; systemic lupus erythematosus; Blood Donors; Complement C1 Inactivator Proteins; Complement C6; Complement C7; Complement C8; Complement Membrane Attack Complex; Complement System Proteins; Hemolysis; Humans; Immune Complex Diseases; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Meningococcal Infections; Receptors, Complement; Receptors, Complement 3b"

Both human and animal exposure studies indicate that the inhalation of low molecular weight (C1-C8) compounds at high concentrations may produce severe central nervous system depression and respiratory paralysis. Short-term inhalation at microgram per liter concentrations does not cause any significant toxicity in humans, but the odors do cause environmental concern. Some delayed toxicity and mortality are seen after subchronic exposure in animals. Respiratory organs are significantly damaged by the inhalation of MSHC compounds, whereas some organ pathology is observed in the spleen, liver, and kidneys after oral and intraperitoneal administration. Dermal toxicity is observed for several high molecular weight compounds (> C8). Of all the compounds tested, monosulfhydrylbenzene is most injurious to the eyes, whereas other compounds cause moderate irritation.

The deficiency of acid α-glucosidase in GSD II is associated with intracellular vacuoles filled with glycogen. However, the deficiency of α-glucosidase does not account for the following unexpected findings in GSD II: excessive accumulation of extralysosomal glycogen; normal appearance of the patient at birth, despite as severely affected tissues as found at death from muscle failure several months later; similar α-glucosidase deficiency in the devastated muscle of an adult with GSD II as in the same patient's heart that was normal in weight, size, and glycogen concentration, and essentially normal histologically; initial excessive glycogen accumulation in areas of adult GSD II myocytes that do not exhibit glycogen-filled 'abnormal lysosomes;' the presence in hepatocytes of occasional tightly-packed glycogen accumulations not surrounded by a membrane; and a drop in glycogen concentration and disappearance of abnormal lysosomes from the liver of a patient with GSD II who had received a long-term infusion of glycogen-degrading enzymes. The lysosomes were not apparent during continued enzyme infusion, whereas liver glycogen concentration returned to high values. We speculate that these unexpected findings can result from the synthesis of a type of glycogen that requires functioning lysosomes for its disposal. The rate of synthesis of this glycogen may be different in normal cells and in cells affected with GSD II. Treatment with enzymes will probably be unsuccessful as long as they cannot be introduced into clinically affected organs. Gold particles in vitro entered selected compartments of abnormal lysosomes; perfluorinated particles in vivo entered RE cells including Kupfer cells, but neither type of particle entered cells of muscle, heart, or brain, which was also true for exogenous enzymes. Thus, at present, prenatal diagnosis is of practical importance in lysosomal disease. The diagnosis can be quickly accomplished by electron microscopy of uncultured amniotic fluid cells in GSD II, but not in Hurler's disease, which instead, requires the assay of α-L-iduronidase in cultured cells. An affected fetus with either disease gives electron microscopic and enzymatic findings that are characteristic for the respective disorder. A girl with deficiencies of arylsulfatases A, B, and C and intact iduronidase had brain and liver characteristics by electron microscopy that were different from metachromatic leucodystrophy (which is characterized by arylsulfatase A deficiency), but was identical to that observed in Hurler's or Hunter's diseases (which are characterized by the deficiency of iduronidase or iduronosulfate sulfatase, respectively). To explain this observation, we postulate that the tissue of the girl with multiple sulfatase deficiency is also deficient in iduronosulfate sulfatase, i.e., in the enzyme that is defective in Hunter's disease. Transplantation of normal fibroblasts has been reported by others to have had beneficial effects in three patients with Hunter's disease; we applied the technique to one boy with Hurler's disease and saw no ill effects. Benefits, if any, have not yet been assessed. In Chediak-Higashi syndrome, which is presumed to be a lysosomal disease because of cellular inclusions and the nature of leucocyte dysfunction, a specific enzyme defect has apparently not been described. Nonetheless, the administration of vitamin C has been reported by others to associated in vitro with the normalization of cyclic 3',5'-AMP concentration, and in vivo with the survival of patients with this previously fatal disease.","adrenalin; enzyme; brain cortex; diagnosis; electron microscopy; glycogen storage disease; histology; hurler syndrome; inborn error of metabolism; liver; lysosome; review; skin; therapy; Chediak-Higashi Syndrome; Female; Glycogen Storage Disease; Glycogen Storage Disease Type II; Human; Infant, Newborn; Leukodystrophy, Metachromatic; Lysosomes; Mucopolysaccharidosis II; Pregnancy; Sulfatases; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."

Most clinical and experimental data indicate that reduced uteroplacental blood flow and attendant placental ischemia mark the critical point for development of symptoms and lesions. The hypothesis carries with it the idea that substances from the damaged placenta are returned via uterine veins to the maternal organism and that these substances cause elevation of systolic and diastolic pressure, proteinuria secondary to glomerular lesions, focal hepatic necroses, fluid retention presumably secondary to sodium retention, and alteration in the coagulation mechanism. At this point it becomes apparent that uterine vein blood is preferable to peripheral blood for analysis, because many substances implicated undergo rapid biologic change or are deposited at sites where lesions are seen. A recent study by Arias and Mancilla-Jimenez demonstrated that in liver biopsies of toxemic women the hepatic sinusoids were outlined by fibrin (or fibrinogen) and that these substances were present in areas of hepatic necrosis. To a lesser extent, IgG, IgM and C3 were also demonstrated by immunofluorescence in the necrotic foci. The investigators suggest that this is a factor common to both hepatic and renal injury - an attractive hypothesis. Considerable attention has been focused on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system as the humoral basis for hypertension in toxemic women. Human chorion contains four times the concentration of renin than that of amniotic fluid, which in turn has 40 times the concentration of renin than that of maternal plasma. But, until recently, methodologic problems made renin determinations chancy, and reported results were often contradictory. There is a significant difference between experimental models of pregnancy toxemia and the disease as it occurs in pregnant women. In experimental animals this disease is induced at a given instant of time, i.e. when the surgical occlusion of aorta or uterine arteries is completed. The only experiment to avoid this limitation is the one devised by Hodari, who placed his Teflon bands around the uterine arteries before his animals were bred, thereby allowing for a slower evolution of the entire process. The best treatment is to empty the uterus. The liver regenerates and the glomerular lesion is reversible. Some diseases succumb to a single brilliant coup, but others decline due to the inevitability of gradualism. Jenner's demonstration of smallpox vaccination, for example, was a remarkable flash of genius, and it sealed the doom of the smallpox virus, but it took over a century and a half, the work of countless physicians and their assistants, for medicine to be able to claim that it had eradicated the disease completely from the face of the earth. For toxemia of pregnancy it will take longer.

The required alkali sums are calculated from spectral data using hypervirial equations. Rare gas sums are reviewed, and new values of some quadrupole and octupole sums estimated. The theory of asymptotic series is employed to obtain numerical values and associated error bounds for C 6, C8, and C10 coefficients for a large number of systems.

It is based upon the relative position of cerebellum and brainstem in relation to the foramen magnum and the upper cervical canal. Types I to III are degrees of a similar abnormality in which a conical deformity of the posterior midline cerebellum and the elongated brainstem lie at or below the foramen magnum. In the Type IV deformity, in contrast, the cerebellum and brainstem lie fully within the posterior fossa and their position in relation to the foramen magnum is normal. The most common example of this type is probably the Dandy‐Walker malformation, in which a defect in the inferior vermis is congruent with a ventriculocele of the enlarged fourth ventricle. The Chiari malformations are generally associated with hydrocephalus. The most comprehensive and coherent theory of the origin of these malformations is that abnormal hydrostatic forces, acting principally during the second and early third trimesters of gestation, provide the mechanism of posterior fossa deformity. Morphological evidence indicates that posterior fossa structures in Types I to III are ‘pushed down’ from above. Radio‐isotope dilution studies suggest that the mechanism of hydrocephalus in Types 1 to III is overproduction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); initially there may be no obstructive component. In those cases without spina bifida, ventricular enlargement should occur early and be greatest in the forebrain, driving the tentorium and posterior fossa structures downward. Where there is a fistulous communication between the ventricular system and the amniotic cavity via a spina‐bifida defect, a pressure gradient between intracranial and spinal compartments may be sufficient to account for downward displacement of posterior fossa structures. In this instance ventricular enlargement may occur only after cerebellar impaction causes frank obstruction to the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. In the Dandy‐Walker malformation, the mechanism of hydrocephalus is probably obstruction to flow of cerebrospinal fluid through the roof of the fourth ventricle. Enlargement of the fourth ventricle is sufficient not only to compress the cerebellum and give rise to the inferior vermal defect, but also to offset forces above the tentorium and prevent its caudal displacement from the parietal region. Les malformations de Chiari de la fosse postérieure et lew rapport avec l'hydrocéphalic La classification des malformations de développement de la fosse postérieure associée à une hydrocéphalic, telle que l'a proposée Chiari est systématique et de portée étendue. Cette classification est basée sur la position relative du cervelet et du tronc cérébral en relation avec le trou occipital et le canal cervical supérieur. Les types I à III sont des degrés d'une anomalie unique dans laquelle une déformation conique de la ligne moyenne cérébelleuse postérieure et le tronc cérébral allongé se situe au niveau et au‐dessous du trou occipital. Dans la déformation de type IV au contraire, le cervelet et le tronc cérébral se situent entièrement dans la fosse postérieure et leur position par rapport au trou occipital est normale. L'exemple le plus commun de ce type est probablement la malformation de Dandy‐Walker, dans laquelle un défaut du vermis inférieur se superpose à un ventriculocèle d'un quatrième ventricule élargi. Les malformations de Chiari sont, en général, associées à une hydrocéphalic La théorie la plus cohérente et la plus complète sur l'origine de ces malformations suppose que des forces hydrostatiques anormales agissant principalement durant le second et le début du troisième trimestre de la gestation constitue le mécanisme des déformations de la fosse postérieure. Des données morphologiques indiquent dans les types I à III que les structures de la fosse postérieure subissent une ‘poussée’ de haut en bas. Les études par dilution de radioisotope suggerènt que le mécanisme de l'hydrocéphalie dans les types I à III est une surproduction de liquide céphalorachidien (LCR); il peut n'y avoir initialement aucune composante d'obstruction. Dans les cas sans spina bifida, l'élargissement ventriculaire se produirait précocément, serait maximum dans le cerveau antérieur, poussant vers le bas la tente du cervelet et les structures de la fosse postérieure. En cas de communication fistuleuse entre le système ventriculaire et la cavité amniotique par spina bifida, la différence de pression entre les compartiments intra‐crâniens et spinaux peut être suffisante pour provoquer le déplacement vers le bas des structures de la fosse postérieure. Dans ce cas, l'élargissement ventriculaire peut ne se produire qu'après que l'impact cérébelleux ait provoqué une obstruction franche à la circulation du LCR. Dans la malformation de Dandy‐Walker, l'hydrocéphalie est probablement causée par l'obstruction de la circulation du LCR à travers le toit du quatrième ventricule. L'élargissement du quatrième ventricule est suffisant non seulement pour comprimer le cervelet et provoquer le défaut du vermis inférieur, mais aussi pour contrecarrer les forces venant d'au‐dessus de la tente et empêchant un déplacement caudal à partir des régions pariétales. Die Chiari‐Miβbildungen der hinteren Schädelgrube und ihre Beziehung zum Hydrocephalus Die Einteilung der Entwicklungsmißbildungen der hinteren Schädelgrubs in Verbindung mit einem Hydrocephalus, wie sie von Chiari vorgeschlagen ist, ist systematisch und umfassend. Die Einteilung basiert auf der Lagebeziehung des Kleinhirns und des Hirnstamms zum Foramen magnum und zum oteren Cervicalkanal. Die Typen I bis III sind verschiedene Grade der gleichen Abnormität, bei der eine konische Deformierung der posterioren Mittellinie des Kleinhirns und des verlängerten Hirnstamms im oder unterhalb des Foramen magnum liegt. Im Gegensatz dazu liegen bei der Deformität des Typs IV das Kleinhirn und der Hirnstamm vollständig innerhalb der hinteren Schädelgrube, und ihre Lagebeziehung zum Foramen magnum ist normal. Das häufigste Beispiel dieses Typs ist wahrscheinlich die Dandy‐Walker‐Mißbildung, bei der ein Defekt des unteren Klein‐hirnwurmes zusammenfällt mit einer Ventriculocele eines vergrößerten vierten Ventrikels. Die Chiari‐Mißbildungen sind im allgemeinen verbunden mit einem Hydrocephalus. Die umfassendste und zutreffendste Theorie über den Ursprung dieser Mißbildungen sagt, daß abnorme hydrostatische Kräfte, die hauptsächlich während des zweiten und frühen dritten Trimesters der Gestationszeit wirken, den Mechanismus der Mißbildung der hinteren Schädelgrube verursachen. Morphologische Hinweise sprechen dafür, daß die Strukturen der hinteren Schädelgrube bei den Typen I bis III von oben her ‘hinuntergedrückt’ werden. Radioisotopenverteilungsstudien lassen vermuten, daß der Mechanismus des Hydrocephalus der Typen I bis III eine Überproduktion von Liquor (CFS) ist; anfänglich mag eine obstruktive Komponente fehlen. In solchen Fällen ohne Spina bifida, sollte die Erweiterung der Ventrikel früh auftreten und am größten im Vorderhirn sein, das Tentorium und die Strukturen der hinteren Schädelgrube hinunterdiängend. Wo eine Fistelverbindung zwischen dem Ventrikelsystem und der Amnionhöhle über einen Spina‐bifida‐Defekt besteht, könnte ein Druckgradient zwischen den intrakraniellen und spinalen Anteilen ausreichen, die Verlagerung der Strukturen der hinteren Schädelgruba zu verursachen. In diesem Fall könnte die Ventrikelerweiterung erst auftreten, nachdem eine cerebelläre Einklemmung eine Verlegung des Liquorflusses bedingt. Bei der Dandy‐Walker‐Mißbildung ist der Mechanismus des Hydrocephalus wahrscheinlich eine Verlegung des Liquorabflusses durch das Dach des vierten Ventrikels. Die Erweiterung des vierten Ventrikels reicht aus, nicht nur das Kleinhirn zu komprimieren und den Defekt des unteren Kleinhirnwurmes entstehen zu lassen, sondern auch Kräfte über das Tentorium freizusetzen und seine kaudale Verdrängung von der Parietalregion zu verhindern. Las malformaciones de Chiari de la fosa posterior y su relation con la hidrocefalia La clasificación de las malformaciones del desarrollo de la fosa posterior asociadas a la hidrocefalia propuestas por Chiari son completas y sistemáticas. La clasificación se basa en la posición relativa del cerebelo y del tronco cerebral en relación con el foramen magnum y la parte alta del canal cervical. Los tipos I al III son grados de una anomalía similar en la que una deformación crónica del cerebelo medio posterior y el tronco cerebral elongado yacen a nivel o por debajo del foramen magnum. En la malformación IV, por el contrario, el cerebelo y el tronco cerebral yacen por completo en la fase posterior y su posición en relación con el foramen magnum es normal. El ejemplo más común de este tipo es probablemente la malformación de Dandy‐Walker, en que un defecto del vermis inferior es congruente con un ventrículocele del cuarto ventrículo agrandado. Las malformaciones de Chiari en general son halladas en asociacion con hidrocefalia. La teoría más comprensiva y coherente sobre el origen de estas malformaciones mantiene que las fuerzas hidrostáticas anormales, actuando principalmente durante el segundo y tercer trimestre de la gestatión, proporcionan el mecanismo de la deformación de la fase posterior. La evidencia neurológica indica que las estructuras de la fase posterior en los tipos I al III son “empujadas hacia abajo” desde arriba. Los estudios con radioisótopes diluidos sugieren que el mecanismo de la hidrocefalia en los tipos I al III es una sobreproducción de líquido cefalorraquídeo (LCR); inicialmente puede no haber ningún componente obstructive En los casos sin espina bífida, el agrandamiento ventricular podría ocurrir tempranamente y ser mayor en el cerebro anterior, llevando el tentorio y las estructuras de la fase posterior hacia abajo. Cuando existe una comunicación fistulosa entre el sistema ventricular y la cav dad amniótica a través de un defecto de espina bífida, un gradeiente de presión entre los compartimentos intracraneal y espinal puede ser suficiente para explicar el desplazamiento hacia abajo de las estructuras de la fase posterior. En este caso, el agrandamiento ventricular puede ocurrir solamente después de que el impacto cerebeloso cause una franca obstructión del flujo del LCR. En la malformación de Dandy‐Walker el mecanismo del hidrocefalo probablemente es una obstructión del flujo del LCR a través del techo del cuarto ventrículo. El agrandamiento del cuarto ventrículo es suficiente no sólo para comprimir el cerebelo y producir el defecto del vermis inferior sino también para compensar las fuerzas por encima del tentorio y evitar su desplazamiento caudal a partir de la región parietal.

The addition of loci of the classical and alternate pathway of complement activation to the HLA region (i.e., C2, C4 and the Bf system) is reviewed with respect to functional relationship to immune recognition and mediation mechanisms.

In contrast to granulomatous diseases and aneurysms of the ascending thoracic aorta, which have decreased, the incidence of benign tumors is essentially unchanged. Clinical features of superior vena cava obstruction in relation to the anatomical site of obstruction and collateral pathways are correlated. Diagnostic approaches, including angiography and technetium scanning, are usually definitive in outlining the site of obstruction. Experimental data and the numerous available techniques for surgical correction indicate that an entirely satisfactory procedure is not available for all patients. Methods include the use of venous bypass or Teflon prostheses and the addition of a small arteriovenous fistula proximally. Two new cases of superior caval obstruction due to benign tumor are reported. In 1 patient, who had intrapericardial bronchogenic cyst with fibrotic caval obstruction and thrombosis, a method for caval reconstruction while maintaining venous return to the right atrium is described. The second patient had an intrathoracic thyroid adenoma and caval obstruction without thrombosis. © 1975, The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

Besides this tendency to get systemic lupus erythematosus there is an increased tendency to develop immune complex glomerulonephritis and one case of a further putative immune complex disease, Henoch Schonlein purpura, was described. In this case it seems likely that the infective agent, an unclassified mycoplasma, is the antigen. Although the significance of these associations is far from clear it can be conjectured that the complement deficiency leads to some subtle immunity deficiency allowing the persistence of chronic non virulent infections to produce their harmful defects by giving rise to immune complex disease. The effects of deficiencies in the activation of the alternative pathway remain to be described since such deficiencies are not yet known. Deficiencies that lead to interference with efficient C3 activation are associated with severe life endangering bacterial infections and it is fairly clear that in the days before efficient antibiotic therapy such patients would not have survived long enough to be studied. There is certainly no mystery about the adaptive value of this part of the complement sequence. However even severe disturbance of C3 activation does not seem to produce any obvious defect in the capacity of the affected patients to synthesize antibodies. Deficiencies at the C5, 6, 7 stage of the complement sequence are well tolerated and in the cases so far described in man no obvious clinical correlate has been found. From the investigation of animals with these deficiencies at this stage there are hints that failure to lyse nucleated cells and/or platelets in vivo may in certain circumstances produce pathological effects. Deficiencies of C8 and C9 were not observed.","complement; complement component c1; angioneurotic edema; complement deficiency; complement system; diagnosis; drug deficiency; hypogammaglobulinemia; immune deficiency; kidney disease; lupus erythematosus; normal value; review; skin disease; theoretical study; Adolescent; Adult; Angioneurotic Edema; Animal; Antibodies, Antinuclear; Bacterial Infections; Child; Complement; Enzyme Activation; Female; Guinea Pigs; Human; Immunogenetics; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Mice; Phagocytosis; Rabbits; Skin"

A Teflon graft was inserted from the main pulmonary artery to the descending thoracic aorta in order to bypass a stenotic ductus arteriosus, and both pulmonary artery branches were banded to reduce the pulmonary blood flow. This procedure may also prove life-saving in the hypoplastic left heart syndrome, with the addition of atrial septal defect creation when left atrial decompression is indicated. This syndrome was the commonest cause of death from congenital heart disease in the first month of life in our recent experience (31 percent), based on a consecutive autopsy series of 174 neonates with congenital heart disease.

NLGI Fellowship studies have contributed significantly to this phase. Outstanding advances have also been made in manufacture and processing, giving greater efficiencies, shorter times of manufacturing and culminating in the first truly continuous manufacturing process. Radioactive tracing of additive mixing has been accomplished. Packaging has advanced with new materials, and new ingredients for greases have become available. Inventory and quality control has been marked by the use of computers. Mechanical testing and evaluation has been a major effort in supplementing simple non-bearing bench tests by providing laboratory rig tests using actual bearings and gears. Many new designs of testing equipment have been developed, and studies of the friction, wear and e.p. properties of lubricating greases, including ball joint testing, have been extended. Analysis and non-mechanical testing endeavors have included a critical look at the significance of the bomb oxidation test, the development of an instrumental method to measure color, and the use of infrared techniques for quantitative analysis of lithium soap in lubricating grease. Studies on flow and dispensing have been particularly active resulting in an advanced understanding of grease flow, both theoretical and in practical applications. In particular, apparent viscosity determinations have been correlated with flow in pipes in a very useful way. A continuing development of centralized lubricating systems has made for efficiency, economy and safety, and great expansions in bulk handling have come about through better understanding of grease flow. Formulation of lubricating greases has been marked by development of new thickeners in addition to complex soaps, and in the expanded use of molybdenum disulfide as a solid-film lubricating additive. The development and study of products for extreme environments including aerospace applications has resulted in some industrial spin-off. The new NLGI Reference Systems provide samples of the same formulation and manufacture which can be used for research and evaluation by laboratories with assurance of continuity, this being particularly valuable for co-operative investigations by technical societies. New discoveries have been made with old ingredients, such as the finding that high-soap-content greases give longer ball-bearing lives. A special grease has been formulated for the food industry. The application of lubricating greases and requirements for them have been marked by the development of rustproof applications from the ""inside-out"" rather than simply applying an asphaltic undercoating. The new grease-petrolatum-type products applied mainly with airless sprays have given much better rust protection for the life of the automotive vehicle than was obtained previously. Lubrication intervals for automotive chassis greases have continued to increase, although certain makes of cars have reverted to shorter periods and more grease fittings particularly when conventional greases are used. There has been an intensive development of aerospace applications with special greases such as the perfluorinated types coming into the picture where hard vacuum, high temperatures, and other extreme conditions must be resisted. However, it has been found that more conventional greases may work surprisingly well, not only where sealed against vacuum, but in vacuum environments. Improvements have been made in railroad lubrication particularly in the understanding of the functioning of journal roller bearing greases and effect of vibration on them, and the trend toward mild-e.p.-gear-oil traction-motor gear lubricants which give better heat transfer, resist thickening, and afford improved lubrication of gears. The issuance of a revised NLGI Glossary containing approximately 100 terms now agreed upon in the lubricating grease industry should help the understanding of these products by users and others. The NLGI Grade Classification has been made an American Standard and is being considered for international standardization. Production surveys made periodically by NLGI and recent marketing forecasts have resulted in very helpful statistics and the recognition of trends. Considerable thought has been given to better marketing techniques. © 1970.","LUBRICATING GREASES; TOR; U.S.A; WEARA"
