However, the general consequences of amino acid fluorination on structure and activity of peptides and proteins are still controversially discussed. Studying the interaction of fluorinated amino acids with enzyme active sites provides valuable information on how fluoroalkyl groups of peptide-based drugs might interact with target proteins or receptors. Therefore, different enzymatic approaches including proteolysis studies, enzymatic resolutions and peptide bond couplings were studied by our group. © 2006 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","2 amino 2 methylpropionic acid; alanine derivative; alkyl group; amidase; amide; amino acid derivative; anorexigenic agent; antidepressant agent; antidiabetic agent; antiinfective agent; antilipemic agent; antineoplastic agent; antivirus agent; carbon; carboxypeptidase C; chymotrypsin A; clostripain; dipeptide derivative; enzyme inhibitor; esterase; fluorine; papain; peptide derivative; phenylalanine derivative; polypeptide antibiotic agent; protirelin; protirelin derivative; subtilisin; trypsin; unindexed drug; amino acid substitution; catalysis; chemical bond; conformational transition; drug design; drug protein binding; drug receptor binding; drug structure; drug synthesis; enzymatic degradation; enzyme active site; enzyme mechanism; fluorination; hormone inhibition; human; nonhuman; pharmacological parameters; physical chemistry; protein degradation; protein function; protein protein interaction; protein stability; protein structure; protein targeting; review; spectroscopy; structure analysis; Amino Acids; Drug Interactions; Enzyme Stability; Enzymes; Fluorine; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Molecular Structure; Peptides; Protein Engineering"

Perfluorosulfonic acid membranes, e.g. Nafion, are widely used in fuel cell technology; but, despite their success, they show some drawbacks such as high cost, limited operating temperature range and high methanol crossover. These limit their widespread commercial application in DMFCs. Such disadvantages are inspiring worldwide research activities for developing new PEM materials based on non-perfluorinated polymers as alternative to Nafion for DMFCs. A review of membrane properties is carried out on the basis of thermal stability, methanol crossover and proton conductivity. The analysis of DMFC performance covers perfluorosulfonic acid membranes (PFSA), sulfonated aromatic polymers (SAPs) and composite membranes. PFSA membranes are suitable materials in terms of power density, SAPs are more advantageous regarding the low methanol permeability and cost, whereas composite membranes are more appropriate for operation above 100 C. DMFC power density values reported in literature show that, although there are remarkable research efforts on this subject, the achieved results are not yet satisfying. Further work is especially necessary on non-perfluorinated polymers to improve performance and durability for an effective application in practical DMFC devices. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Despite these early warnings, the problems of groundwater, and thus drinking water, contaminated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) including PFOS are only beginning to be addressed. It is clear that this PFAS contamination is poorly reversible and that the societal costs of clean-up will be high. This inability to reverse exposure in a reasonable timeframe is a major motivation for application of the precautionary principle in chemicals management. We conclude that exposure can be poorly reversible; 1) due to slow elimination kinetics in organisms, or 2) due to poorly reversible environmental contamination that leads to continuous exposure. In the second case, which is relevant for contaminated groundwater, the reversibility of exposure is not related to the magnitude of a chemical's bioaccumulation potential. We argue therefore that all PFASs entering groundwater, irrespective of their perfluoroalkyl chain length and bioaccumulation potential, will result in poorly reversible exposures and risks as well as further clean-up costs for society. To protect groundwater resources for future generations, society should consider a precautionary approach to chemicals management and prevent the use and release of highly persistent and mobile chemicals such as PFASs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Chemicals; Contamination; Fire extinguishers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Potable water; Bioaccumulation potential; Chemicals management; Environmental contamination; Microgram-per-liter level; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; PFASs; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Precautionary principle; Groundwater pollution; alkyl group; drinking water; fluoride; ground water; perfluoroalkane sulfonyl fluoride; perfluoroalkyl acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; surface water; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; ground water; bioaccumulation; chemical pollutant; drinking water; groundwater pollution; organic acid; persistent organic pollutant; precautionary principle; reaction kinetics; bioaccumulation; case study; concentration (parameters); cost benefit analysis; environmental exposure; environmental management; human; limit of detection; priority journal; Review; sediment; soil analysis; water analysis; water pollution; prevention and control; water pollutant; water pollution; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Groundwater; Humans; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution"

Nevertheless, the treatment technologies are still evolving, and thus, long-term strategies should be implemented with caution. In this study, the physical and chemical properties of PFAS were provided. The emerging treatment technologies for PFAS removal, such as ion exchange resins, adsorption, advanced oxidation process, and membrane-based separation, are briefly reviewed in this paper.

Because of their physicochemical properties, these substances may be industrially used as cleaning solvents in the electronic components, fire suppression agents in the fire protection, and heat transfer fluids in the heat exchangers. From the environmental, ecological, and healthy points of view, it is urgent to understand their environmental risks of these HFPEs. This article aimed at introducing these HFPEs in physiochemical properties and potential uses, and evaluating their environmental risks (i.e., global warming, photochemical potential, and environmental partition). Further, the updated data on their toxicological profiles and potential exposure hazards from their degradation products were also addressed in this paper. It is indicated that HFPEs still pose some significant hazards, especially global warming and photochemical potentials, to the atmosphere. Regarding the estimation of partition properties (i.e., vapor pressure, octanol-water partition coefficient and bioconcentration) of HFPEs, the predicted values of log Kow for several HFPEs were found to be below zero, suggesting that they should possess very low potential for bioaccumulation in the environment. © 2006.","Environmental impact; Global warming; Oligomers; Solvents; Environmental risks; Exposure hazard; Hydrofluoropolyethers (HFPE); Photochemical potential; Ethers; chlorofluorohydrocarbon; fluorocarbon; hydrofluoropolyether; octanol; polyether derivative; water; Environmental impact; Ethers; Global warming; Oligomers; Solvents; bioaccumulation; environmental risk; global warming; greenhouse gas; hydrofluorocarbon; risk assessment; toxicity; atmosphere; bioaccumulation; chemical structure; environmental exposure; environmental impact; fire protection; fluorination; greenhouse effect; heat exchange; ozone layer; partition coefficient; physical chemistry; pollution; review; risk assessment; statistical significance; vapor pressure; Environment; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Ethers; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Risk Assessment"
NA,Association between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus,2022,NA,NA,"Background: Existing evidence suggests that perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exposure might contribute to the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis to identify the association between PFAS and the risk of GDM. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for appropriate articles about the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of GDM before September 28, 2020. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized by Stata 16.0 through fixed effect models according to heterogeneity. We also carried out subgroup analyses by geographic location, blood sampling time of subjects, method of chemical analysis, study design, sample size, and sampling year. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the robustness of the results. Results: A total of eight studies involving 5654 pregnant women were included in the meta-analysis. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was positively and significantly associated with the risk of GDM (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02–1.59). Exposure to other types of PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of GDM with the pooled effect estimates of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86–1.09), 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86–1.24), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55–1.16) respectively. Conclusion: We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and GDM and found that PFOA concentration was significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of GDM in public health. Further studies are needed in order to establish causality and clarify the potential mechanism. © 2021",NA

PFAS exposure in people can have detrimental health consequences. Therefore, reducing PFAS burdens in food items is of great importance to public health. Here, we investigated whether cooking reduces PFAS concentrations in animal-derived food products by synthesizing experimental studies. Further, we examined the moderating effects of the following five variables: cooking time, liquid/animal tissue ratio, cooking temperature, carbon chain length of PFAS and the cooking category (oil-based, water-based &amp; no-liquid cooking). In our systematic review searches, we obtained 512 effect sizes (relative differences in PFAS concentration between raw and cooked samples) from 10 relevant studies. These studies exclusively explored changes in PFAS concentrations in cooked seafood and freshwater fish. Our multilevel-meta-analysis has revealed that, on average, cooking reduced PFAS concentrations by 29%, although heterogeneity among effect sizes was very high (I2 = 94.65%). Our five moderators cumulatively explained 49% of the observed heterogeneity. Specifically, an increase in cooking time and liquid/animal tissue ratio, as well as shorter carbon chain length of PFAS (when cooked with oil) were associated with significant reductions in PFAS concentrations. The effects of different ways of cooking depended on the other moderators, while the effect of cooking temperature itself was not significant. Overall, cooking can reduce PFAS concentrations in blue food (seafood and freshwater fish). However, it is important to note that complete PFAS elimination requires unrealistically long cooking times and large liquid/animal tissue ratios. Currently, literature on the impact of cooking of terrestrial animal produce on PFAS concentrations is lacking, which limits the inference and generalisation of our meta-analysis. However, our work represents the first step towards developing guidelines to reduce PFAS in food via cooking exclusively with common kitchen items and techniques. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon; Fish; Liquids; Meats; Moderators; Oils and fats; Tissue; Water; Cooking time; Data synthesis; Human exposures; Meta-analysis; Meta-regression; PFOA; PFOS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; POP; Substance concentrations; Cooking; carbon; chemical compound; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; water; alkanesulfonic acid; carbon; fluorocarbon; concentration (composition); food quality; literature review; meta-analysis; organofluorine; persistent organic pollutant; seafood; concentration (parameter); cooking; data synthesis; effect size; food analysis; food contamination; food intake; freshwater fish; human; nonhuman; practice guideline; raw food; Review; sea food; systematic review; temperature sensitivity; animal; cooking; fish; meta analysis; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Carbon; Cooking; Fishes; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Seafood

As it is not known why the strictly controlled C system starts to react against autologous heart tissue, we have analyzed the expression of various membrane regulators of C (CR1, DAF, MCP, CD59, C8 binding protein) and the pattern of deposition of C components and plasma C regulators (C4b binding protein and vitronectin) in normal (n = 7) and infarcted (n = 13) human myocardium. In the infarcted myocardium deposits of the C membrane attack complex (MAC) were observed by immunofluorescence microscopy, and lesions resembling the transmembrane channels of MAC were detected by transmission electron microscopy. CD59 and C8 binding protein were strongly expressed by muscle cells of normal myocardial tissue. Little or no CR1, MCP, and DAF was observed on these cells. The assembly of MAC was accompanied by the deposition of vitronectin (S-protein) and C4b binding protein in the infarcted areas of myocardium. In accordance with our earlier results the expression of CD59 but not of C8 binding protein was clearly diminished in the lesions. The results show that C8 binding protein, vitronectin, and C4b binding protein do not prevent complement attack against the infarcted myocardium but rather become codeposited with the MAC. Ischemia-induced transformation of nonviable cells into complement activators, acquired loss of resistance to the MAC by shedding of CD59, and recruitment of multifunctional serum proteins by MAC could thus constitute a general process aimed at the clearance of injured tissue.","binding protein; cd59 antigen; complement component c4b; complement membrane attack complex; regulator protein; vitronectin; antigen expression; cell transformation; complement activation; complex formation; heart infarction; human; human tissue; immunofluorescence microscopy; immunohistochemistry; membrane channel; priority journal; review; transmission electron microscopy; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Complement C4; Complement Membrane Attack Complex; Female; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Glycoproteins; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Immunohistochemistry; Macrophage Activation; Male; Microscopy, Electron; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Sarcolemma; Time Factors; Vitronectin"

Specifically, maternal exposure to lead, cadmium, chromium, copper and manganese appeared to be correlated with an elevated risk for preterm birth. Additionally, maternal exposure to monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was also associated with preterm birth.

For many years during this timeframe, 19F imaging research continued at a slow pace as the various attributes of the technique were explored. However, over the last decade and particularly the last several years, the pace and clinical relevance of 19F imaging has exploded. In part, this is due to advances in MRI instrumentation, 19F/1H coil designs, and ultrafast pulse sequence development for both preclinical and clinical scanners. These achievements, coupled with interest in the molecular imaging of anatomy and physiology, and combined with a cadre of innovative agents, have brought the concept of 19F into early clinical evaluation.

From then on, the perfluorinated chemicals as new emerging contaminants, have received great attention, and the research about their environmental problems has come to a new stage of development. This paper reviews the research progress on the analytical method, environmental distribution and behavior, bioaccumulation and biomagnification, human exposure and healthy effect, emerging analogues of PFASs. The emphasis be laid on the advances achieved after perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride were listed into Annex B of the convention. The current critical areas of research that warrant further attention are also discussed.",NA

Due to its chemical and physical properties, it is accumulated in food chains and not metabolized. PFOA has been found in detectable levels in biological samples of animals and humans all over the world. Reported mean serum levels of PFOA is about 4 ng/ml in general population, and its estimated half-life is 3.8 years in humans. Although the exposure ways to PFOA is not exactly described for humans, it is suggested that contaminated drinking water, food, breast milk, indoor air, dust and non-stick pans might be the possible sources. While limited in number, the results of human studies suggested that blood, breast milk, liver, kidneys, lungs, seminal plasma, thyroid gland and bones are the principal organs for PFOA distribution. Epidemiological studies showed that there is a positive correlation between PFOA exposure and various health problems including carcinogenesis, cardiovascular and thyroid diseases, chronic kidney failure, hepatotoxicity, high cholesterol and obesity. In addition, data obtained from general population studies emphasized that PFOA affects reproductive, developmental and immune systems.

This review summarizes the available data regarding the toxic effects of OUVFs on marine and freshwater organisms and generates the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) values necessary for assessing ecological risk. Through a systematic search of the literature, 89 studies were identified and ecotoxicological data extracted. Collectively, these studies described toxicity testing with 39 OUVF from 10 structural classes, with derivatives of benzophenones (49%) and camphors (16%) most studied. There was a bias towards selecting freshwater species (61%), and evaluating single OUVF effects (87%) rather than OUVF mixtures. Short-term (acute) experimentation (58%) was marginally more common than long-term (chronic) testing (42%). Reproductive, developmental, genetic, and neurological toxicity were the most commonly identified effects in aquatic organism, and were associated with molecular interactions with steroid receptors, DNA, or the production of reactive oxygen species. Species sensitivity distribution and/or assessment factors were used to calculate PNECs for 22 OUVFs and the risk quotients for 12 OUVFs. When using maximum concentrations, high risk was observed for six OUVFs in marine environments (4-methylbenzylidene-camphor, octocrylene, padimate-O, benzophenone-1, and oxybenzone, ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate), and for four OUVFs in freshwater environments (ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, avobenzone and oxybenzone). When using median concentrations, a risk to marine environments was observed for oxybenzone.

Modern-day ICD systems use transvenous high-voltage leads to act as the interface between the heart and the generator, allowing for the sensing of a cardiac activity and the delivery of both bradycardia and tachycardia therapy, including high-voltage, high-current shocks. The ICD lead is in many ways the most fragile and critical component of the ICD system, and is subjected to more stress than any other implanted medical device. It has similar components to a pacing lead including tip and ring electrodes, fixation mechanism, conductors, insulators, and connector pins. In addition, it also contains the high-voltage shock coils that allow the delivery of defibrillation therapy to the cardiac tissue. The materials used to manufacture each of these components have undergone little evolution from their initial pacing lead-derived origin, but promising progress in this area is now occurring and better conductors and insulators have been developed. Lead body design continues to be multiluminal rather than coaxial, but various iterations of this basic paradigm continue to be investigated. In addition to miniaturization of the entire ICD lead, new industry standard lead connectors will also be introduced to reduce complexity and pocket bulk. However, long-term failure rates have been considerable, with lead failure related to both conductor and insulator malfunction. It is hoped that recent improvements in an ICD lead design and manufacture will result in a good functionality with a reliable long-term performance.

However, only small number of studies can be found in the literature due to the major drawbacks associated with the GC determination of PFCAs such as high detection limits, a small range of analytes, long analysis time, and laborious derivatization prior to chromatographic separation. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS2) can overcome these limitations of GC, and therefore has become the method of choice for the determination of PFCAs since 2001. Nevertheless, GC as a low-cost and commonly available analytical technique should not be ignored because of its inherent advantage over LC to identify PFCA isomers in environmental and biological matrices owing to its high-resolution power. In addition, GC provides an opportunity to crosscheck LC–MS2 results that are often suspicious due to background contamination. This tutorial provides an overview of GC methods that have been used for the determination of PFCAs after derivatization. Moreover, performance characteristics of GC–MS are compared with that of LC–MS2. PFCAs in aqueous samples were determined by both analytical techniques, and two sets of measurements were compared using the Bland-Altman plot. For both methods, reasons for false-positive and false-negative results (overestimation and underestimation of the PFCA concentration, respectively) are discussed, and accordingly some advice is offered on how to avoid erroneous results. Finally, major applications of GC and its future perspectives for the determination of PFCAs are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Effluents; Isomers; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Phase separation; Bland-altman plots; Chromatographic separations; False positive and false negatives; Gas-chromatographic determination; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Perfluorocarboxylic acid; PFOA; Solid-phase extraction; Gas chromatography; acetic acid ethyl ester; carboxylic acid derivative; dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; formic acid derivative; hydrofluoric acid; isobutylchloroformic acid; n,n bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide; perfluorocarboxylic acid derivative; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorophosphinic acid derivative; propyl chloroformic acid; trifluoroacetamide derivative; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; water; aqueous solution; concentration (parameters); derivatization; false negative result; false positive result; high performance liquid chromatography; human; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography; mass fragmentography; measurement repeatability; microwave emission detector; microwave radiation; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; solid phase extraction; solid phase microextraction; tandem mass spectrometry; analysis; gas chromatography; water pollutant; Chromatography, Gas; Chromatography, Liquid; Fluorocarbons; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The FTS reaction has received many attentions due to a limited petroleum resource with an increased demand for using alternative carbon sources such as stranded gas or shale gas. Some proper synthetic methods of an effective FTS catalyst having a larger active metal surface area and a lower deactivation rate are the most important issues for a long-term operation. Therefore, some ordered mesoporous materials (OMM) have been widely investigated in the field of CO hydrogenation using some heterogeneous catalysts. The present brief review paper summarized the various preparation methods of the ordered mesoporous materials for the possible applications of FTS reaction with a lower deactivation rate and a higher catalytic performance. The applications of the ordered mesoporous cobalt oxides for FTS reaction are briefly introduced and the ways to improve a structural stability even under reductive CO hydrogenation conditions by using efficient pillaring materials as well as by preparing mixed metal oxides. A higher catalytic activity of the ordered mesoporous cobalt oxide was also verified in a multi-channel fixed-bed compact reactor having the intersected interlayers of micro-channel heat exchanger. The thermal stability of ordered mesoporous cobalt-based catalysts was mainly affected by a structural stability which can easily remove the heavy hydrocarbons from the inner surfaces. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",NA

The skin coverage is usually adequate but the aponeurotic defect has to be closed temporally using synthetic patches. The use of these materials leads to increase complication such as infection, fistula formation and extrusion. In addition a second operation is required to remove the material and to perform a definitive closure. The role of fascia lata in reconstruction of abdominal wall is well established as free grafts, pedicled flaps or free flaps. Bank cadaveric fascia lata is used extensively in neurosurgical, ophtalmological, orthopaedic and urogynecological procedures. This is the first description of the use of cadaveric fascia lata for the closure of large abdominal wall defects. CASE REPORTS: We present two cases of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The first patient was a newborn who presented the impossibility to close the fascia, that was salvaged by a teflón patch. Five months later the wound opened, leaving the mesh exposed that had to be removed. A cadaveric fascia lata patch was used to cover the defect, closing the skin satisfactorily. The second case was a two days newborn. We performed the diaphragmatic closure, and the aponeurotic defect was closed using cadaveric fascia lata. RESULTS: Cosmetic and functional appearance are satisfactory in both cases and no complications have been seen. CONCLUSION: Fascia lata patches are revascularized in the abdominal wall and incorporates into receptor tissue. They have the following advantages with respect to synthetic materials: First, the risk of complications is lower. Second, their removal is not necessary. Finally, no intraperitoneal adhesions occur. The risks of disease transmission and rejection are minimized by the Centro Comunitario de Transfusiones donor selection and processing of the cadaveric fascia lata.","abdominal wall musculature; cadaver; case report; fascia lata; human; male; newborn; review; transplantation; Abdominal Muscles; Cadaver; Fascia Lata; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male"

Human research on this topic has generally focused on single exposure- health effect relationships. The ""exposome"" concept encompasses the totality of exposures from conception onward, complementing the genome. Objectives: The Human Early-Life Exposome (HELIX) project is a new collaborative research project that aims to implement novel exposure assessment and biomarker methods to characterize early-life exposure to multiple environmental factors and associate these with omics biomarkers and child health outcomes, thus characterizing the ""early-life exposome."" Here we describe the general design of the project. Methods: In six existing birth cohort studies in Europe, HELIX will estimate prenatal and postnatal exposure to a broad range of chemical and physical exposures. Exposure models will be developed for the full cohorts totaling 32,000 mother-child pairs, and biomarkers will be measured in a subset of 1,200 mother-child pairs. Nested repeat-sampling panel studies (n = 150) will collect data on biomarker variability, use smartphones to assess mobility and physical activity, and perform personal exposure monitoring. Omics techniques will determine molecular profiles (metabolome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome) associated with exposures. Statistical methods for multiple exposures will provide exposure-response estimates for fetal and child growth, obesity, neurodevelopment, and respiratory outcomes. A health impact assessment exercise will evaluate risks and benefits of combined exposures. Conclusions: HELIX is one of the first attempts to describe the early-life exposome of European populations and unravel its relation to omics markers and health in childhood.

There has been tremendous progress in the technologies needed to address the concerns that conventional and novel water contaminants pose. Yet, to date, only a few relatively small DPR operations have been installed. As we get closer to the point where regulations are finalized and serious investments are planned, there is a need to ask: Are we ready? In this Review, we explore the technological, economic, and environmental considerations associated with DPR. In particular, we focus on the status of technologies for addressing the most challenging water pollutants, the cost estimates for DPR, and the energy demand and associated implications of DPR. We find that, although the technologies are nearly ready for DPR, the most critical issue will be real-time monitoring of a number of molecules that pose distinct challenges to advanced treatment trains. In addition, there is a need to consider emergency planning, both in terms of emergency buffer reservoir(s) and planning for situations in which the treated water does not meet specifications. Since any advanced treatment train will result in a significant increase in embedded energy, it will be particularly important to plan for renewable energy to minimize environmental impacts. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",NA

Fluorine present in a molecule largely determines its specific chemical and biological properties. This thematic issue covers the trends of organofluorine chemistry that have been actively developed in Russia the last 15 ± 20 years. The review describes nucleophilic substitution and heterocyclization reactions involving fluorinated arenes and quinones and skeletal cationoid rearrangements in the polyfluoroarene series. The transformations involving CF3-substituted carbocations and radical cations are considered. Heterocyclization and oxidative addition reactions of trifluoroacetamide derivatives and trans- formations of the organic moiety in polyfluorinated organoboranes and borates with retention of the carbon - boron bond are discussed. Particular attention is devoted to catalytic olefination using freons as an efficient synthetic route to fluorinated compounds. The application of unsymmetrical fluorine-containing N-heterocyclic carbene ligands as catalysts for olefin metathesis is demonstrated. A variety of classes of organofluorine compounds are considered, in particular, polyfluorinated arenes and 1,2-diaminobenzenes, 1-halo-2-trifluoroacetylacetylenes, α-fluoronitro compounds, fluorinated heterocycles, 2-hydrazinylidene-1,3-dicarbonyl derivatives, imines and silanes.

Those molecular alterations can be found in the bloodstream, which suggests that we could quantify specific biomarkers in plasma or serum by very sensitive methods before the onset diabetes mellitus is diagnosed. However, classical methods of protein analysis such as electrophoresis, Western blot, ELISA, and liquid chromatography are generally time-consuming, lab-intensive, and not sensitive enough to detect such alteration in a pre-symptomatic state of the disease. Method A very sensitive and novel analytical detection conjugate system by using the combination of polyfluorophor technology with protein microchip method was developed. Results This innovative system facilitates the use of a very sensitive microchip assays that measure selected biomarkers in a small sample volume (10 μL) with a much higher sensitivity (92%) compare to common immune assay systems. Further advances of the application of this technology combine the power of miniaturization and faster quantification (around 10 min). Conclusion The power of this technology offers great promise for point-of-care clinical testing and monitoring of specific biomarkers for diabetes in femtogram level in serum or plasma. In conclusion, the results indicate that the technical performance of this new technology is valid and that the assay is able to quantified PPY-specific antigens in plasma at femtogram levels which can be used for identification of beta cell dysfunction at the pre-symptomatic stage of diabetes mellitus. © European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA) 2017.",biopsy technique; biotechnology; cell damage; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic equipment; diagnostic error; diagnostic test; diagnostic value; disease course; disease marker; human; immunoassay; in vitro diagnostic assay; in vitro study; laboratory diagnosis; measurement; microchip analysis; miniaturization; molecular biology; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; point of care testing; private health insurance; protein determination; public health insurance; Review; sensitivity and specificity; symptom

Physiological and pathophysiological stimuli suchas cytokines, growth factors, receptor and integrin activation, contractile agonists,ions, and reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the positive regulation ofTonEBP expression and activity in diverse cell types. These new data demonstratethat tonicity-independent stimulation of TonEBP is critical for tissue-specificfunctions like enhanced cell survival, migration, proliferation, vascular remodeling,carcinoma invasion, and angiogenesis.

However, their structural and chemical similarities have proven daunting challenges to incumbent separation technologies, which are energy- and capital-intensive. Approaches capable of discerning and exploiting minute differences in isomeric hydrocarbons, in particular, may provide solutions to this problem. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) integrating the merits of tunable pore size at sub-angstrom scale and pore chemistry in confined spaces have presented promising prospects in adsorptive separation to recognize the minor differences in gas molecules via the judicious design and functionalization. In this Review, we explore the usage of MOFs for the underexplored adsorptive separation of hydrocarbons in the liquid/vapor phase, especially for C6 and C8 isomers. The in-depth insights into the structure-property relationship and the dominant mechanisms, including host-guest interaction modes for the effective adsorption of C6 and C8 hydrocarbons, are systematically discussed. Finally, the effectiveness and scope to translate such design strategies into other systems and the perspective on future development in MOFs for separation are provided. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Chemical industry; Isomers; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organic polymers; Pore size; Separation; Adsorptive separation; Chemical similarity; Confined space; Energy; Gas molecules; Hydrocarbon separation; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Separation technologies; Structural similarity; Tunables; Hydrocarbons

Not only is oxygen the driving force for many cellular functions and metabolism, but it is also involved in regulating stem cell fate, morphogenesis, and organogenesis. Low oxygen levels are the naturally preferred microenvironment for most processes during early development and mainly drive proliferation. Later on, more oxygen and also nutrients are needed for organogenesis and morphogenesis. Therefore, it is critical to maintain oxygen levels within a narrow range as required during development. Modulating oxygen tensions is performed via oxygen homeostasis mainly through the function of hypoxia-inducible factors. Through the function of these factors, oxygen levels are sensed and regulated in different tissues, starting from their embryonic state to adult development. To be able to mimic this process in a tissue engineering setting, it is important to understand the role and levels of oxygen in each developmental stage, from embryonic stem cell differentiation to organogenesis and morphogenesis. Taking lessons from native tissue microenvironments, researchers have explored approaches to control oxygen tensions such as hemoglobin-based, perfluorocarbon-based, and oxygen-generating biomaterials, within synthetic tissue engineering scaffolds and organoids, with the aim of overcoming insufficient or nonuniform oxygen levels and nutrient supply. © 2018 © 2018 S.

Efforts to immunize in the first weeks of life, in various species, have had limited success in general. This has been attributed to a combination of immaturity of the neonatal immune system and interference by maternal antibodies. Most studies of neonatal immune responsiveness have been carried out in neonatal mice, or by examination of cellular components of human umbilical cord blood. Both approaches have their limitations. The current review describes factors, including corticosteroids, complement proteins, cytokines, maternal lymphocytes and antibodies, which may influence immune responses of neonates, comparing data from studies of domestic animals and humans. Neonates are highly dependent on passive (maternal) antibodies for protection against a wide range of pathogens. These maternal antibodies have been noted to interfere with active immune responses to many, but not all, vaccines. Various theories have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including epitope masking, clearance of immune complexes and FcγRII mediated regulation of B cells. Remarkably, many studies examining the effects of passive antibodies on immune responses of adults, have demonstrated immune enhancing effects. The evidence for enhancing and suppressive effects of passive antibodies on antigen uptake, processing and regulation of lymphocyte responses is reviewed. Since maternal antibodies (as present in neonates) differ in subisotypes and affinity from the passive antibodies often used in experimental systems, here is a need for better experimental models investigating the effects of bona fide maternal antibodies on immune responses of neonates (not adult surrogates). Vaccines can be optimized for use in neonates - by making better use of existing vaccine technologies and by harnessing the potential of recent immunological and technological advances. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","bovine viral diarrhea vaccine; complement component C3; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; corticosteroid; CpG oligodeoxynucleotide; DNA vaccine; epitope; gamma interferon; glucocorticoid receptor; hydrocortisone; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; live vaccine; maternal antibody; measles vaccine; pertussis vaccine; phosphorothioic acid; retinol; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; virus vaccine; antibody response; B lymphocyte; Bovine diarrhea virus; bovine viral diarrhea; cellular immunity; colostrum; dendritic cell; domestic animal; erythrocyte; human; hydrocortisone blood level; immune response; immunoregulation; measles; measles vaccination; neonate vaccination; nonhuman; passive immunization; pertussis; priority journal; protein expression; review; T lymphocyte; umbilical cord blood; vaccination; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Animals; Animals, Newborn; B-Lymphocytes; Cytokines; Humans; Immunity, Active; Immunity, Maternally-Acquired; Immunocompetence; Infant, Newborn; Vaccination; Vaccines"

The aim of this review was to determine the association between environmental chemical exposures and preeclampsia. PubMed was searched for articles examining a priori chemical exposures and preeclampsia through April 2018. Studies were included in our review if they included at least 10 cases, evaluated preeclampsia independent of gestational hypertension, and used either measured or modeled exposure assessments. Our review contained 28 investigations examining persistent organic pollutants (POP) (6 studies), drinking water contaminants (1 study), atmospheric pollutants (11 studies), metals and metalloids (6 studies), and other environmental contaminants (4 studies). There were an insufficient number of investigations on most chemicals to draw definitive conclusions, but strong evidence existed for an association between preeclampsia and cadmium (Cd). There is suggestive evidence for associations between nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM)(2.5), and traffic exposure with preeclampsia. There is evidence for an association between preeclampsia and Cd but insufficient literature to evaluate many other environmental chemicals.

The cause of disease pathology is an expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats within the huntingtin gene (HTT) on chromosome 4 (4p16.3), which codes the huntingtin protein (mHTT). The common symptoms of HD include motor and cognitive impairment of psychiatric functions. Patients exhibit a representative phenotype of involuntary movement (chorea) of limbs, impaired cognition, and severe psychiatric disturbances (mood swings, depression, and personality changes). A variety of symptomatic treatments (which target glutamate and dopamine pathways, caspases, inhibition of aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, transcriptional dysregulation, and fetal neural transplants, etc.) are available and some are in the pipeline. Advancement in novel therapeutic approaches include targeting the mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein and the HTT gene. New gene editing techniques will reduce the CAG repeats. More appropriate and readily tractable treatment goals, coupled with advances in analytical tools will help to assess the clinical outcomes of HD treatments. This will not only improve the quality of life and life span of HD patients, but it will also provide a beneficial role in other inherited and neurological disorders.

Globally, North America is the main consumer of the most toxic BDEs mix (penta-BDE) for humans and environment. The highest concentrations of PBDEs have been reported in the USA in wastewater and sewage sludge. In Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, similar concentrations of PBDEs to those of the USA were found in wastewater influents. There are no regulations for PBDEs monitoring, usage and disposal. However, some countries have eliminated and decreased the production and usage of this type of compounds.

Syngas-to-aromatics (STA) is a very promising approach for the synthesis of aromatic monomers, and is catalyzed via bifunctional catalysts in a single reactor, wherein methanol/dimethyl ether and/or olefins intermediates formed from syngas on metal components are converted into aromatic monomers exclusively on the HZSM-5 by cascade reactions. Since an optimal Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) temperature of Fe-based catalysts is very close to an aromatization temperature of HZSM-5, Fe-based catalysts have been frequently used/modified for the synthesis of aromatic monomers from hydrogenation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2). The nature of metal components and amounts of Brönsted acid sites on HZSM-5, and their mesoporosity and intimacy, significantly alter the selectivity for aromatics by tuning BTX distibution and catalyst stability. Although many developments have been achieved regarding the STA process in recent years, no reviews have been published in this flourishing research area over the last two decades. Here, the recent advances and forthcoming challenges in the progress of syngas (CO+H2) chemistry and hydrogenation of CO2 toward the value-added aromatic monomers through cascade reactions are highlighted. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This concept is a novel approach to chemicals management that determines whether using substances of concern, such as PFAS, is truly essential for a given functionality. To assess the essentiality of a particular use case, three considerations need to be addressed: (1) the function (chemical, end use and service) that the chemical provides in the use case, (2) whether the function is necessary for health and safety and critical for the functioning of society and (3) if the function is necessary, whether there are viable alternatives for the chemical for this particular use. A few illustrative examples of the three-step process are provided for use cases of PFAS. The essential-use concept takes chemicals management away from a substance-by-substance approach to a group approach. For PFAS and other substances of concern, it offers a more rapid pathway toward effective management or phase-out. Parts of the concept of essential use have already been widely applied in global treaties and international regulations and it has also been recently used by product manufacturers and retailers to phase out substances of concern from supply chains. Herein some of the common questions and misinterpretations regarding the practical application of the essential-use concept are reviewed, and answers and further clarifications are provided.

They belong to the class of perfluoroalkyl substances, possessing properties such as high chemical stability, high mobility, high water solubility, extraordinary persistence in the environment, bioaccumulability in living tissues, and toxicity. Because of such properties, HFPO-DA and GenX are ubiquitously found in the environment, where they can remain almost unmutated for an extremely long time, so that such chemicals, together with the other perfluoroalkyl substances, are being named “forever chemicals”. Due to their adverse effects on human health and the environment, growing regulatory attention is paid to these pollutants. Parallelly, new technologies for their removal are highly necessary because conventional ones are almost ineffective. However, there is limited available information regarding the effectiveness of HFPO-DA and GenX treatment methods. The present article reviews the characteristics and occurrence of these emerging chemicals in the environment. Also, the removability of HFPO-DA and GenX by novel treatment approaches (membranes, adsorption, and degradation techniques) and conventional wastewater treatment are discussed. Studies reported in the literature indicate that these chemicals are not efficaciously eliminated by conventional technologies currently used in wastewater treatment plants. Early observations suggest that adsorption and high-pressure membranes could be considered the most promising removal technologies available on the market. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Biochemistry; Chemical stability; Chemicals; Wastewater treatment; Ammonium salt; Anthropogenics; Dimer acids; Forever chemical; Genx; Hexafluoropropylene oxide; Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid; Perfluoroalkyl substances; PFAS; Property; Dimers

This review presents some available data on the PFAS environmental distribution in the world, and in particular in Europe and in the Veneto region of Italy, where it has become a serious problem for human health. The consumption of contaminated food and drinking water is considered one of the major source of exposure for humans. Worldwide epidemiological studies report the negative effects that PFAS have on human health, due to environmental pollution, including infertility, steroid hormone perturbation, thyroid, liver and kidney disorders, and metabolic disfunctions. In vitro and in vivo researches correlated PFAS exposure to oxidative stress effects (in mammals as well as in other vertebrates of human interest), produced by a PFAS-induced increase of reactive oxygen species formation.

Formamidopyrimidines, 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyAde) and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua), are among the major lesions generated in DNA by hydroxyl radical attack, UV radiation, or photosensitization under numerous in vitro and in vivo conditions. They are formed by one-electron reduction of C8-OH-adduct radicals of purines and thus have a common precursor with 8-hydroxypurines generated upon one-electron oxidation. Methodologies using mass spectrometry exist to accurately measure FapyAde and FapyGua in vitro and in vivo. Formamidopyrimidines are repaired by base excision repair. Numerous prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA glycosylases are highly specific for removal of these lesions from DNA in the first step of this repair pathway, indicating their biological importance. FapyAde and FapyGua are bypassed by DNA polymerases with the insertion of the wrong intact base opposite them, leading to mutagenesis. In mammalian cells, the mutagenicity of FapyGua exceeds that of 8-hydroxyguanine, which is thought to be the most mutagenic of the oxidatively induced lesions in DNA. The background and formation levels of the former in vitro and in vivo equal or exceed those of the latter under various conditions. FapyAde and FapyGua exist in living cells at significant background levels and are abundantly generated upon exposure to oxidative stress. Mice lacking the genes that encode specific DNA glycosylases accumulate these lesions in different organs and, in some cases, exhibit a series of pathological conditions including metabolic syndrome and cancer. Animals exposed to environmental toxins accumulate formamidopyrimidines in their organs. Here, we extensively review the mechanisms of formation, measurement, repair, and biological effects of formamidopyrimidines that have been investigated in the past 50 years. Our goal is to emphasize the importance of these neglected lesions in many biological and disease processes.","2,6 diamino 4 hydroxy 5 formamidopyrimidine; 4,6 diamino 5 formamidopyrimidine; 8 hydroxyguanine; DNA glycosyltransferase; hydroxyl radical; pyrimidine derivative; unclassified drug; carcinogenesis; DNA damage; enzyme specificity; excision repair; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; mass spectrometry; metabolic syndrome X; mutagenesis; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidative stress; photosensitization; priority journal; reduction; review; ultraviolet radiation; DNA; DNA Repair; DNA-Formamidopyrimidine Glycosylase; Humans; Pyrimidines; Animalia; Eukaryota; Mammalia; Mus; Prokaryota"

Generally it is formed by the union of the ventral primary rami of the spinal nerves, C5-C8 and T1, the so-called 'roots' of the brachial plexus. The goal here is to examine the neural architecture of the brachial plexus. The most constant arrangement of nerve fibers will be delineated, and then the predominant variations in neural architecture will be defined, particularly the prefixed and postfixed plexus, as well as the microanatomy and anatomy of the major terminal branches of the plexus. Multiple tracts connect many parts of the nervous system, and multiple ascending and descending tracts connect the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and lower spinal centers with the brain. This reflects that the nervous system is able to extract different pieces of sensory information from its surroundings and encode them separately, and that it is able to control specific aspects of motor behavior using different sets of neurons. Examination of the major sensory or motor pathways reveals a highly and tightly organized nervous system. In particular, at each of many levels, we see fairly exact maps of the world within the brain. In an effort to understand the functional neuroanatomy of the brachial plexus, this paper will focus briefly on the nervous connections of the nerves of the upper extremity with the brain.

Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between PFAS exposure and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the results are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFAS and MetS. We performed a systematic search strategy using three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies concerning the associations of PFAS with MetS and its clinical relevance from inception until January 2021. We undertook meta-analyses where there were five or more studies with exposure and outcomes assessments that were reasonably comparable. The pooled odd ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects models and heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 index and Q test. A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (10 studies on the general population and two studies in the occupational settings) investigated the association between PFAS exposure and MetS. We pooled data from seven studies on the general population for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and five studies for perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Predominately, most studies reported no statistically significant association between concentrations of PFAS and MetS. In the meta-analysis, the overall measure of effect was not statistically significant, showing no evidence of an association between concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS and the risk of MetS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, current small body of evidence does not support association between PFAS and MetS. However, due to limited number of studies and substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Further scrutinizing cohort studies are needed to evaluate the association between various and less well-known PFAS substances and their mixture with MetS and its components in both adults and children in different settings. © 2021 Maryam Zare Jeddi et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.",fluorocarbon; adult; child; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; human; meta analysis; metabolic syndrome X; pollutant; toxicity; Adult; Child; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Metabolic Syndrome

Results related to disordered carbon anodes and improved, solvent-free, as well as gel-type, polymer electrolytes are particularly stressed. It is shown that the use of proper gel electrolytes, in combination with suitable electrode couples, allows the development of new types of safe, reliable, and low-cost lithium ion batteries which appear to be very promising power sources for hybrid vehicles. Some of the technologies proven to be successful in the lithium battery area are readapted for use in fuel cells.

Lancet (2016); 388: 3027–35 and Callaghan et al. Pediatrics (2006);118: 1566–73. Despite advances in prenatal care, prematurity remains a persistent clinical problem, with 1 in 8 births occurring prematurely (prior to 37 weeks of gestation) in the USA as discussed by Frey and Klebanoff Semin Fetal Neonatal Med (2016);21: 68–73,. Advances in neonatology including gentle ventilation strategies, permissive hypercapnia, and the use of corticosteroids have led to substantial improvements in survival; however, long-term survivors of preterm birth face considerable morbidities affecting every major organ system. Chronic lung disease represents one of the most common and significant long-term complications of preterm birth and is attributable largely to iatrogenic injury due to the underdeveloped nature of the alveoli and lack of compliance of the immature lung as stated by Behrman and Butler (2007). Conventional gas-based ventilation of the premature lung leads to barotrauma, inflammation, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) as discussed by Sinha and Donn Semin Fetal Neonatal Med (2006);11: 166–73. Recent Findings: Since the discovery of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) over 70 years ago, liquid ventilation has been examined as a viable alternative to conventional gas-based mechanical ventilation in a variety of disease models, including that of extreme prematurity. PFCs are biologically inert organofluorine compounds with remarkably high gas dissolving properties due to weak intermolecular attractive forces, allowing dissolution of up to twenty times the amount of oxygen and three times the amount of carbon dioxide than water as discussed by Wesseler, Iltis, and Clark J Fluor Chem. Elsevier Sequoia S.A (1977);9: 137–46. These compounds have low surface tension, have low viscosity, are relatively dense, and have low vapor pressure (11–85 torr), permitting rapid evaporation from the lungs. One perfluorocarbon liquid of particular clinical interest is perflubron, a PFC with a bromine substituted for a primary fluorine. This compound has been used as a contrast medium and is radiographically opaque, allowing clinicians to examine lung filling in real time according to the study of Kazerooni et al. Radiology (1962);198: 137–42. Initial studies of liquid ventilation have shown increased gas exchange and alveoli recruitment, in addition to the return to fluid-filled physiology similar to that experienced during gestation, as discussed by Kylstram et al. Trans Am SOC Artif Intern Organs (1962;8: 378–83, Clark and Gollan (1966), and Schoenfisch Anid and Kylstra J Appl Physiol (1973);35: 117–21, leading to the identification of liquid ventilation as a promising intervention to support critically preterm infants.

This paper examines proposals for reproductive health activities under humanitarian health and protection funding mechanisms for 2002-2013, and the level at which these reproductive health proposals were funded. Methods: The study used English and French health and protection proposal data for 2002-2013, extracted from the Financial Tracking Service (FTS) database managed by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Every project was reviewed for relevance against pre-determined reproductive health definitions for 2002-2008. An in-depth analysis was additionally conducted for 2009-2013 through systematically reviewing proposals via a key word search and subsequently classifying them under designated reproductive health categories. Among the relevant reproductive health proposals, counts and proportions were calculated in Excel based on their reproductive health components, primarily by year. Contributions, requests, and unfunded requests were calculated based on the data provided by FTS. Results: Among the 11,347 health and protection proposals issued from 345 emergencies between 2002 and 2013, 3,912 were relevant to reproductive health (34.5%). The number of proposals containing reproductive health activities increased by an average of 21.9% per year, while the proportion of health and protection sector appeals containing reproductive health activities increased by an average of 10.1% per year. The total funding request over the 12 years amounted to $4.720 billion USD, of which $2.031 billion USD was received. Among reproductive health components for 2009-2013 proposals, maternal newborn health comprised the largest proportion (56.4%), followed by reproductive health-related gender-based violence (45.9%), HIV/sexually transmitted infections (37.5%), general reproductive health (26.2%), and lastly, family planning (14.9%). Conclusion: Findings show that more agencies are responding to humanitarian appeals by proposing to implement reproductive health programs and receiving increased aid over the twelve year period. While such developments are welcome, project descriptions show comparatively limited attention and programming for family planning and abortion care in particular. © 2015 Tanabe et al.",NA

However, little data exists on the effects of exposure to PFAS at environmentally relevant concentrations and this hampers the effective management of these compounds. This paper reviews current research on the occurrence and ecotoxicology of PFAS at environmentally relevant doses to assess their potential biological impacts. Hazard Quotient (HQ) analysis was undertaken as part of this assessment. Most PFAS detected in the environment were found to have a HQ risk value of <1 meaning their reported concentrations are below their predicted no effect concentration. This indicates many reported toxic effects of PFAS are, theoretically, unlikely to occur outside the laboratory. However, lack of information on new PFAS as well as their precursors and degradation products, coupled with lack of knowledge of their mixture toxicity means our understanding of the risks of PFAS is incomplete, especially in regard to sub-lethal and/or chronic effects. It is proposed that the development of molecular markers for PFAS exposure are needed to aid in the development of environmental PFAS regulations that are effective in fully protecting the environment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Degradation; Toxicity; Biological impacts; Degradation products; Effective management; Hazard quotients; Mixture toxicity; Molecular marker; Predicted no-effect concentrations; Synthetic chemicals; Environmental regulations; biomarker; concentration (composition); ecological impact; ecotoxicology; environmental monitoring; environmental response; environmental risk; molecular analysis; pollution exposure; regulatory approach; ecotoxicology; metabolomics; review; environmental exposure; human; procedures; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Ecotoxicology; Environmental Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Humans

Risk assessment is difficult and highly uncertain. Little breakthrough products or technologies have yet emerged that can match the feats of fluorinated surfactants and fluorinated polymers. Radical, disruptive new solutions are needed. Meanwhile, more reasonable, more selective use of these compounds appears indispensable in order to reduce exposure while preserving their societal benefits and without penalizing developing countries. Progress in the risk management of per- and polyfluorinated substances is, however, impeded by considerable knowledge and information gaps, and will demand sustained multidisciplinary efforts. © 2015.",Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Developing countries; Risk assessment; Risk management; Surface active agents; Sustainable development; Toxicity; Fluorinated surfactant; Human exposures; Persistence; PFBA; PFBS; PFOA; PFOS; Pollutant; Regulation; Responsibility; Chemical resistance; fluorine derivative; perfluoro compound; polyfluorinated substance; unclassified drug; atmospheric transport; bioaccumulation; biotransformation; blood placenta barrier; degradation; developing country; environmental impact; epidemiology; fluorination; food contamination; greenhouse effect; human; microbial degradation; nonhuman; occupational exposure; pharmacodynamics; public health; Review; risk assessment; risk management; sex difference; waste water management

Tetracycline has been widely used for decades in human and veterinary medicines, with incremental residues in the environment and adverse influences on living organisms. In the present study, the genetic toxicity of tetracycline was investigated using a bioassay method with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) root-meristem cells at a concentration range of 0.25-300 mg L-1 and exposure times of 24, 48, and 72 h. The results indicated that tetracycline at lower concentrations (0.25-1 mg L-1) stimulated cell mitotic division, whereas at 50-300 mg L-1 concentration caused a concentration-related decrease in mitotic index (MI). The lower tetracycline concentrations induced a slight increase in the frequency of micronucleus (MN), chromosomal aberration (CA), and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in wheat root tips. However, there were significant increases in these indices at higher concentrations in concentration- and time-dependent manners, including the frequencies of MN (25-200 mg L-1), CA (10-200 mg L-1), and SCE (5-200 mg L-1), respectively. The inducement of MN, CA, and SCE decreased at 250 and 300 mg L-1 due to acute cell toxicity for all tested times. Comparatively, SCE was the most sensitive, followed by CA, with MN the least sensitive to the genotoxicity of tetracycline in wheat. These results imply that tetracycline may be genotoxic to plant cells, and exposure to tetracycline may pose a genotoxic risk to living organisms. The results also suggest that the wheat bioassay was efficient, simple, and reproducible in monitoring the genotoxicity of tetracycline in the environment. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Chromosomal aberration; Cytogenetic damage; Emerging pollutants; Genetic toxicity; Micronucleus; Mitotic index; Root-meristem cell; Sister chromatid exchange; Tetracycline; Wheat bioassay; Biology; Chromosomes; Concentration (process); Pollution; Toxicity; Veterinary medicine; Bioassay; tetracycline; antibiotics; bioassay; concentration (composition); environmental issue; genotoxicity; organic pollutant; pollution exposure; risk factor; root system; toxicity test; wheat; bioassay; chromosome aberration; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cytotoxicity; genotoxicity; meristem; micronucleus; mitosis index; nonhuman; plant root; pollutant; priority journal; review; sister chromatid exchange; wheat; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Chromosome Aberrations; DNA Damage; Humans; Meristem; Micronucleus Tests; Mitosis; Mitotic Index; Mutagens; Sister Chromatid Exchange; Soil Pollutants; Tetracycline; Triticum; Triticum aestivum

It is well known that these hazardous chemicals in beverages can represent a severe threat by the potential risk of generating diseases to humans if no strict quality control is applied during beverages processing. This review compiles the most updated knowledge of the presence of potential contaminants in various types of beverages (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), as well as in their containers, to prevent undesired migration.

Investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites yield large amounts of monitoring data; however, historically, these data have not been available in large, consolidated datasets. The California GeoTracker web site and database is a public repository for a wide variety of information related to investigation and remediation of cleanup sites in California. Under California regulations, responsible parties must submit laboratory analytical results for environmental samples in electronic form along with reports and other information. The GeoTracker website also supports public access to the entire database of laboratory analytical results, which, for some sites, date back to 2001. This database includes approximately 285,000,000 analytical records for more than 50,000 contaminated and formerly contaminated sites in California. Because of the large volume of publicly-available data, GeoTracker has been used as the primary data source for a number of data mining studies in the last 10 years. This article describes the GeoTracker origin story and how it has evolved to account for changes in regulatory priorities such as understanding vapor intrusion mechanisms and distribution of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the environment, while maintaining database continuity. Finally, we review data mining projects that have utilized GeoTracker to better understand various aspects of contaminated site management.

Attention has mostly been focused on T-cell-mediated cellular mechanisms of allograft rejection to explain these losses; however, as in other forms of solid-organ transplantation, especially kidney and heart, antibody-mediated mechanisms of acute and chronic allograft injury are increasingly being implicated. In this review, the mechanisms of B-cell- and humoral-mediated allograft injury will be briefly discussed along with the limited evidence that exist for invoking antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) as important in intestine transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: The presence of donor-specific antibody has been reported to increase the incidence and severity of intestine allograft rejection and to worsen the overall prognosis for graft and patient. C4d staining in intestine biopsies is unreliable, and currently it is not possible to diagnose AMR with certainty in intestine transplantation. Treatment of presumed AMR in intestine recipients is purely anecdotal at this time. SUMMARY: Further basic and clinical research needs to be conducted to more confidently diagnose and treat AMR in intestinal transplantation. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","azathioprine; complement component C2; complement component C2b; complement component C3; complement component C3b; complement component C4; complement component C4b; complement component C4d; complement component C5b; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement membrane attack complex; corticosteroid; eculizumab; immunoglobulin; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; mycophenolic acid 2 morpholinoethyl ester; rituximab; antibody mediated rejection; cellular immunity; complement activation; corticosteroid therapy; disease severity; drug megadose; graft rejection; human; humoral immunity; hyperacute graft rejection; immunoadsorption; immunosuppressive treatment; intestine biopsy; intestine graft; intestine transplantation; plasmapheresis; prognosis; review; splenectomy; staining; Graft Rejection; Humans; Immunity, Humoral; Intestine, Small; Organ Transplantation; Transplantation Immunology"

Its long half-life in humans, indefinite persistence in the environment, and awareness of its widespread presence in drinking water make the human health assessment of PFOS a priority. While developmental, endocrine, and hepatic effects, and increased serum cholesterol are among the outcomes resulting from PFOS exposure, immunosuppression has also consistently emerged as an adverse effect. An in-depth review of the relevant scientific literature on the toxicology of PFOS has identified immunosuppression as a sensitive endpoint for PFOS toxicity. Here, we focus specifically on that endpoint and provide a detailed derivation of a Reference Dose (RfD) of 1.8 × 10−6 mg/kg/day for chronic human exposure to PFOS. This RfD is based on decreased plaque-forming cell (PFC) response in mice, an endpoint that reflects suppression of the immune response to a foreign antigen. We additionally identify two endpoints in the epidemiology literature, decreased vaccine response and increased incidence of childhood infections, that are associated with PFOS exposure and that are consistent with and support the decreased PFC response endpoint from animal studies. We provide a weight of evidence analysis integrating the evidence from animal and epidemiology endpoints. Finally, we compare this RfD to the PFOS RfD derived by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Office of Water based on a developmental endpoint. Based on this comparison, and given our assessment, the USEPA RfD does not provide sufficient protection against the adverse health effects of PFOS. The RfD derived herein is intended to be public health protective and appropriately minimizes PFOS exposure based on available evidence. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",drinking water; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; cell; chemical compound; developmental biology; dose-response relationship; ecotoxicology; epidemiology; health monitoring; immune response; pollution exposure; public health; risk assessment; analytical parameters; cholesterol blood level; dose; immune response; immunosuppressive treatment; immunotoxicity; infection; nonhuman; plaque forming cell; priority journal; reference dose; Review; animal; child; environmental exposure; human; mouse; United States; Animalia; Mus; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Child; Environmental Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Mice

The etiology of MRKH syndrome is complex and largely unexplained. Familial clustering suggests a genetic component and the spectrum of clinical presentations seems consistent with an inheritance pattern characterized by incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Mutations of several candidate genes have been proposed as possible causes based on genetic analyses of human patients and animal models. In addition, studies of monozygotic twins with discordant phenotypes suggest a role for epigenetic changes following potential exposure to environmental compounds. The spectrum of clinical presentations is consistent with intricate disruptions of shared developmental pathways or signals during early organogenesis. However, the lack of functional validation and translational studies have limited our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in this condition. The clinical management of affected women, including early diagnosis, genetic testing of MRKH syndrome, and the implementation of counseling strategies, is significantly impeded by these knowledge gaps. Here, we illustrate the embryonic development of tissues and organs affected by MRKH syndrome, highlighting key pathways that could be involved in its pathogenesis. In addition, we will explore the genetics of this condition, as well as the potential role of environmental factors, and discuss their implications to clinical practice. © 2021.","beta catenin; bone morphogenetic protein; diethylstilbestrol; fibroblast growth factor; homeobox protein Hox-A10; methoxychlor; organochlorine pesticide; organotin compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; phthalic acid; transcription factor; transcription factor DACH2; unclassified drug; Wnt4 protein; Wnt7a protein; Wnt9b protein; binding affinity; clinical feature; clinical practice; developmental toxicity; early diagnosis; embryo development; environmental factor; epigenetics; female; female genital system; genetic analysis; genetic screening; genetic variation; heredity; human; karyotype; knowledge; monozygotic twins; mouse; Muellerian duct; nonhuman; organogenesis; pathogenesis; patient counseling; phenotype; prenatal diagnosis; Review; Rokitansky syndrome; surgical technique; vagina reconstruction; validation process; wolffian duct; animal; congenital disorder; disorder of sex development; genetics; Muellerian duct; vagina; 46, XX Disorders of Sex Development; Animals; Congenital Abnormalities; Female; Humans; Mullerian Ducts; Phenotype; Vagina"

PFAS have numerous applications in the industrial and commercial fields. They have become abundant in the environment and have been detected in the blood of humans and animals. PFAS exposure likely increases the risk of certain diseases. In recent years, there has been a steep rise in related primary and secondary articles. Objectives: We aim to collate narrative and systematic reviews including both qualitative and quantitative synthesis on biological, environmental, or medical aspects of PFAS exposure and burdens, and to create an evidence review map to fulfil three main objectives. 1) Mappingto reveal what evidence on PFAS has been systematically reviewed and where synthesis may be needed. 2) Bibliometrics: to characterise the interdisciplinarity, independence and connectedness of the reviews. 3) Critical appraisal: to assess the included reviews for the reliability of conclusions and methodological transparency. This overview of reviews will inform future research and policy making. Search and study eligibility: We will perform a systematic search on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and the ‘grey literature’. To be included in the map, a study must be a review from the systematic review family and focus on at least one of predefined 31 PFAS. We will limit inclusions to peer-reviewed publications, pre-prints, and theses without any language restrictions. At least two authors will scan title, abstract and keywords, followed by full-text screening of included reviews. Critical appraisal of reviews and synthesis methods: We will assess each review of the systematic review family referencing the AMSTAR2 checklist. We will collect information on conflict-of-interest statements, funding sources and availability of raw data and analysis code. We will extract relevant data from full texts and bibliographic records, conduct bibliometric analyses, and display findings as tables, figures and a narrative synopsis. © 2021 The Authors",Abstracting; Diagnosis; Organic chemicals; Anthropogenic organic chemicals; Bibliometrics analysis; Eco-toxicology; Map analysis; PFOA; PFOS; Systematic Review; ‘overview of review’; ‘systematic review’; ‘umbrella review’; Animals

We have contributed to this multi-faceted, worldwide effort with the development of predictors for GPI lipid anchor sites, for N-terminal N-myristoylation sites, for farnesyl and geranylgeranyl anchor attachment as well as for the PTS1 peroxisomal signal. Although the substrate protein sequence signals for various PTMs or translocation systems vary dramatically, we found that their principal architecture is similar for all the cases studied. Typically, a small stretch of the amino acid residues is buried in the catalytic cleft of the protein-modifying enzyme (or the binding site of the transporter). This piece most intensely interacts with the enzyme and its sequence variability is most restricted. This stretch is surrounded by linker segments that connect the part bound by the enzyme with the rest of the substrate protein. These residues are, as a trend, small with a flexible backbone and polar. Due to the mechanistic requirements of binding to the enzyme, we suggest that most PTM sites are necessarily embedded into intrinsically disordered regions (except for cases of autocatalytic PTMs, PTMs executed in the unfolded state or non-enzymatic PTMs) and this issue requires consideration in structural studies of proteins with complex architecture.

Many studies have reported the association between PFCs exposure with the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, those reports are still debatable, due to their findings. Thus, this review paper aimed to analyse the association of PFCs compound with CVDs and their risk factors in humans by systematic review and meta‐analysis. Google Scholar, PubMed and ScienceDirect were searched for PFCs studies on CVDs and their risk from 2009 until present. The association of PFCs exposure with the prevalence of CVDs and their risk factors were assessed by calculating the quality criteria, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). CVDs risk factors were divided into serum lipid profile (main risk factor) and other known risk factors. The meta‐analysis was then used to derive a combined OR test for heterogeneity in findings between studies. Twenty‐nine articles were included. Our meta‐analysis indicated that PFCs exposure could be associated with CVDs (Test for overall effect: z= 2.2, p = 0.02; Test for heterogeneity: I2 = 91.6%, CI = 0.92–1.58, p &lt; 0.0001) and their risk factors (Test for overall effect: z= 4.03, p &lt; 0.0001; Test for heterogeneity: I2 = 85.8%, CI = 1.00– 1.14, p &lt; 0.0001). In serum lipids, total cholesterol levels are frequently reported associated with the exposure of PFCs. Among PFCs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) exposure increased the risk of CVDs than other types of PFCs. Although the risk of PFOA and PFOS were positively associated with CVDs and their risk factors, more observational studies shall be carried out to identify the long‐term effects of these contaminants in premature CVDs development in patients. © 2021 by the authors.

This study presents an institutional anesthesia protocol, defines reported anesthetic considerations, and provides a comprehensive update to inform future directions of the field. Methods: An institutional ""FT Anesthesia Protocol""was developed and applied to 2 face transplants. A systematic review of 3 databases captured FTs in the peer-reviewed literature up to February 2020. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts to include all clinical articles with FT recipient and/or donor-specific preoperative, intraoperative, and relevant postoperative anesthetic variables. Data charting guided a narrative synthesis, and quantitative synthesis reported variables as median (range). Results: Our institutional experience emphasizes the importance of on-site rehearsals, anticipation of patient-specific anesthetic and resuscitative requirements, and long-term pain management. Systematic search identified 1092 unique records, and 129 met inclusion criteria. Reports of 37 FTs in the literature informed the following anesthetic axes: donor pre- and intraoperative management during facial allograft procurement, recipient perioperative care, immunotherapy, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and pain management. Quantitative synthesis of 30 articles showed a median operative time of 18 hours (range, 9-28) and fluid replacement with 13 L (5-18) of crystalloids, 13 units (0-66) of packed red blood cells, 10 units (0-63) of fresh frozen plasma, and 1 unit (0-9) of platelets. Conclusions: Anesthetic considerations in FT span the continuum of care. Future efforts should guide standard reporting to establish evidence-based strategies that promote quality improvement and patient safety. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Chemical modifications on main chains, side chains, and chain ends of PFs via the incorporation of charge-transport moieties can reduce the hole- and electron-injection barriers; while physical manipulation on main-chain structures of PFs, poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorene) (PFO), after dipping in mixed solvent/non-solvent (tetrahydrofuran/methanol) can generate β-phase with extended conjugation length, leading to a promoted charge balance and stable pure blue emission. Hole- and electron-injection barriers can be effectively lowered by the insertion of hole-transport and electron-injection layers, respectively. The recent development of PFs with various emission colors, via physical blending or chemical modification, are presented for a comprehensive understanding of PFs for device applications. The deliberate choice of cathode material with work function matching the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PFs is another efficient method for increasing electron flux, and is also discussed in this review. © Springer-Verlag.",NA

In this paper, we assess the potential risks related to the application of CCS technology and the acidification of aquatic ecosystems through CO2 enrichment. We use the multiple lines of evidence approach (LOEs) to characterize the effects of the acidification with contamination in aquatic sediments. We highlight and discuss the effects of acidification on the LOEs including contamination and mobility of contaminants in sediments, toxicity, macrobenthic community structure, in situ effects, and bioaccumulation-biomagnification processes. We further assess the results of acidification on the toxicity of organic contaminants such as antibiotics or illicit drugs like the freebase form of cocaine (crack). The main goal of using the LOE approach is to distinguish between adverse effects that are associated with contaminants and those related to acidification by enrichment of CO2 as a result of CCS technology. Previous assessments were not designed or conducted to incorporate an integrative point of view, nor did they employ a weight of evidence approach (WOE) in risk characterization and management of CCS operations and other situations related to acidification by enrichment of CO2 in the aquatic ecosystem. Based on the findings of this review, the WOE can identify the effects of the acidification on the different LOEs used for sediment quality: contaminant mobility, the adverse effects in organism under laboratory and field conditions, and the bioaccumulation-biomagnification of contaminants. The main strength in using the WOE is the ability of this method to discriminate between LOE responses associated with contamination by different organic and inorganic substances from those related to CO2 acidification itself. The WOE will significantly improve the risk assessment in areas affected by potential leakages of CO2 during CCS operations. © 2019 Published by NRC Research Press.",Acidification; Aquatic ecosystems; Atmospheric chemistry; Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Contamination; Greenhouse gases; Risk assessment; Risk management; Sedimentology; Sediments; Toxicity; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Bioavailability; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Emerging pollutants; Integrative assessment; Technological development; Weight of evidence approach; Weight of evidences; Carbon capture

Studies have investigated the role of a number of maternal environmental exposures on subsequent allergic disorders in the offspring. We summarize findings from recent studies on prenatal environmental factors influencing IgE levels, atopy, and early asthma. Recent Findings: A building literature supports the influence of maternal exposure to environmental pollutants, such as allergens, traffic-related air pollution, tobacco smoke, and organochlorine compounds and social factors on allergic outcomes. More novel associations have been investigated, such as the effect of prenatal exposures to phthalates, bisphenol A, and magnetic fields. There is also rising interest in epigenetics as a pathway of action by which maternal exposure affect immune health. Summary: Emerging research highlights the challenges of investigating in-utero exposures and of relating exposures to such a heterogeneous and complex outcome as allergic disease. Further research is needed on the mechanisms by which prenatal exposure influences allergic response in childhood and how postnatal, familial and social factors, and sex can modify disease outcomes. Epigenetics is a promising new frontier, and likely one of several explanatory factors.

Earlier mouse models emphasize the importance of autoreactive antibodies formed against ""self"" proteins that serve as a source for T cell-mediated immune response, stemming from cross-reactivity and resulting in B cell activity. However, more recent models suggest the need for both autoantibodies and the initiation of the inflammatory cascade via the alternative complement pathway, which is unbridled as the cartilage lacks the usual regulatory proteins of the complement system. Furthermore, deficiencies in specific complement proteins could lead to an escape from negative selection by these self-reactive B cells. Moreover, the classical complement pathway establishes chemotactic gradients by which inflammatory cells follow and accumulate in the synovial fluid where they engulf immune complexes and release proteolytic enzymes. In addition, the processing of circulating immune complexes either via Fc receptor or CR1 and opsonization by complement fragments plays a key role in determining the fate of immune status. In addition, complement proteins are a major determinant in the size and solubility of an immune complex, which also affects clearance. The evidence regarding intra-articular activation of the complement system in RA provides the possibility to pharmacologically manipulate various parts of the complement system for therapeutic purposes and potential therapeutic targets for the control of inflammation and the prevention of joint destruction. © 2005 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","C reactive protein; collagen type 2; complement component C1q; complement component C1r; complement component C1s; complement component C2; complement component C4; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement membrane attack complex; complement receptor; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; interleukin 1; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; mitogen activated protein kinase; STAT protein; tumor necrosis factor; acute phase response; antigen antibody complex; Arthus phenomenon; autoimmunity; cellular immunity; complement activation; complement system; cross reaction; cytokine production; effector cell; Epstein Barr virus; human; innate immunity; lymphocyte proliferation; molecular mechanics; nonhuman; pathophysiology; phagocytosis; priority journal; review; rheumatoid arthritis; T lymphocyte activation; Animals; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Complement System Proteins; Humans"

Currently, patients suffering from diseased and injured organs are treated with transplanted organs or cells. This paper reviews recent advances that have occurred in regenerative medicine and describes application of new technologies to treat diseased or damaged organs and tissues. Recent findings: Although most current strategies for tissue engineering depend upon a sample of autologous cells from the diseased organ of the patient, biopsies from patients with extensive end-stage organ failure may not yield enough normal cells. In these situations, stem cells are envisioned as being an alternative source. Stem cells can be derived from discarded human embryos (human embryonic stem cells), from fetal tissue, or from adult sources (bone marrow, fat, skin). Therapeutic cloning offers a potentially limitless source of cells for tissue engineering applications.

Epimastigotes, the non-infective form of the parasite, present in triatomine arthropod vectors, are highly susceptible to complement-mediated lysis while trypomastigotes, the infective form, present in host bloodstream, are resistant. Thus T. cruzi susceptibility to complement varies depending on the parasite stage (amastigote, trypomastigotes or epimastigote) and on the T. cruzi strain. To avoid complement-mediated lysis, T. cruzi trypomastigotes express on the parasite surface a variety of complement regulatory proteins, such as glycoprotein 58/68 (gp58/68), T. cruzi complement regulatory protein (TcCRP), trypomastigote decay-accelerating factor (T-DAF), C2 receptor inhibitor trispanning (CRIT) and T. cruzi calreticulin (TcCRT). Alternatively, or concomitantly, the parasite captures components with complement regulatory activity from the host bloodstream, such as factor H (FH) and plasma membrane-derived vesicles (PMVs). All these proteins inhibit different steps of the classical (CP), alternative (AP) or lectin pathways (LP). Thus, TcCRP inhibits the CP C3 convertase assembling, gp58/68 inhibits the AP C3 convertase, T-DAF interferes with the CP and AP convertases assembling, TcCRT inhibits the CP and LP, CRIT confers ability to resist the CP and LP, FH is used by trypomastigotes to inhibit the AP convertases and PMVs inhibit the CP and LP C3 convertases. Many of these proteins have similar molecular inhibitory mechanisms. Our laboratory has contributed to elucidate the role of TcCRT in the host-parasite interplay. Thus, we have proposed that TcCRT is a pleiotropic molecule, present not only in the parasite endoplasmic reticulum, but also on the trypomastigote surface, participating in key processes to establish T. cruzi infection, such as inhibition of the complement system and serving as an important virulence factor. Additionally, TcCRT interaction with key complement components, participates as an anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor molecule, inhibiting at least in important part, tumor growth in infected animals. © 2017 Ramírez-Toloza and Ferreira.",C2 receptor inhibitor trispanning protein; calreticulin; classical complement pathway C3 C5 convertase; complement component C1; complement component C1q; complement component C3; complement component C5; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement factor H; complement regulatory protein; decay accelerating factor; glycoprotein; glycoprotein 58/68; lectin; membrane protein; sialic acid; transforming growth factor beta; unclassified drug; amastigote; bloodstream infection; cancer inhibition; cell vacuole; complement system; enzyme activity; epimastigote; exosome; host parasite interaction; human; intracellular signaling; nonhuman; phagocytosis; plasma membrane derived vesicle; protein binding; protein expression; Review; Trypanosoma cruzi; trypomastigote

Initiation requires ATP-bound DnaA protein, together with replication proteins. Replication is followed by decatenation and monomerization of sister-chromosome molecules. Sister chromosomes are rapidly partitioned into opposite halves of the cell, perhaps by a kinesin-like protein (MukB). Cytokinesis starts with the formation of a ring of a CTP-binding protein (FtsZ), usually around the cell center. A specific enzyme (PBP3) and other proteins (FtsQ, FtsA, FtsL, FtsW) are responsible for the coordinate ingrowth of the peptidoglycan cell wall at this location. EnvA protein is required to split the resultant cross-wall to form new cell poles. The formation of the FtsZ ring is inhibited by activated MinC protein, but the MinE protein reverses this inhibition at potential division sites. A minimum cell length is probably required for partition and a minimum-size DNA-free zone for septum formation.",cell cycle; cell division; DNA replication; Escherichia coli; nonhuman; priority journal; review; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli

Here, the formation of unilamellar vesicles by mixing zwitterionic tetradecyldimethylamine oxide (TDMAO) with the anionic lithium perfluorooctanesulfonate (LiPFOS) was studied as a function of the mixing ratio. SANS data were analyzed in terms of the structural changes and especially with respect to intermediate structures. Vesicle formation occurs via disk-like micelles as intermediates that close to form very monodisperse unilamellar vesicles after reaching a certain size. This process is controlled by the competition between bending energy of the bilayer and the line energy of the disk rim, and its characteristic time is controlled by the electrostatic repulsion that is determined by the TDMAO/LiPFOS ratio. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",Bending energies; Bi-layer; Characteristic time; Different structure; Electrostatic repulsion; In-situ; Intermediate structures; Mixing ratios; Monodisperse; Morphological changes; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; SANS; Small-angle neutron scattering; Stopped flow; Stopped-flow techniques; Structural change; Structural information; Surfactant mixture; Surfactant solution; Time resolution; Time-resolved SANS; Unilamellar vesicle; Vesicle formation; Disks (structural components); Lithium; Neutron scattering; Surface active agents; Synchrotrons; ampholyte; anionic lithium perfluorooctanesulfonate; surfactant; tetradecyldimethylamine oxide; unclassified drug; dispersion; elecrostatic repulsion; electric conductivity; energy; mathematical analysis; membrane vesicle; mesodynamics; micelle; molecular dynamics; neutron scattering; phase transition; priority journal; review; static electricity; structure analysis

This review comprehensively presents the up-to-date developments of media used in both aerobic and anaerobic AGMBRs for treating wastewaters containing conventional and emerging pollutants. It also elaborates the properties of different media, characteristics of attached biomass, and their contributions to AGMBR performance. Conventional media, such as biological activated carbon and polymeric carriers, induce formation of aerobic, anoxic and/or anaerobic microenvironment, increase specific surface area or porous space for biomass retention, improve microbial activities, and enrich diverse microorganisms, thereby enhancing pollutants removal. Meanwhile, new media (i.e. biochar, bioaugmented carriers with selected strain/mixed cultures) do not only eliminate conventional pollutants (i.e. high concentration of nitrogen, etc.), but also effectively remove emerging pollutants (i.e. micropollutants, nonylphenol, adsorbable organic halogens, etc.) by forming thick and dense biofilm, creating anoxic/anaerobic microenvironments inside the media, enriching special functional microorganisms and increasing activity of microorganisms. Additionally, media can improve sludge characteristics (i.e. less extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products, larger floc size, better sludge settleability, etc.), alleviating membrane fouling. Future studies need to focus on the development and applications of more new functional media in removing wider spectrum of emerging pollutants and enhancing biogas generation, as well as scale-up of lab-scale AGMBRs to pilot or full-scale AGMBRs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Bioconversion; Bioreactors; Membrane fouling; Membranes; Microorganisms; Pollution; Reclamation; Anaerobics; Attached growth; Carrier; Emerging pollutants; Growth process; Medium; Membrane bioreactor system; Microenvironments; Nutrient pollutants; Property; Wastewater treatment; activated carbon; biogas; polymer; bioreactor; fouling; persistent organic pollutant; pollutant removal; wastewater treatment; aerobic bacterium; anaerobic bacterium; biofouling; biomass; concentration (parameter); nonhuman; particle size; physical chemistry; physical parameters; quorum quenching; Review; waste component removal; waste water management; artificial membrane; bioreactor; sewage; wastewater; water management; Bioreactors; Membranes, Artificial; Sewage; Waste Water; Water Purification"

The A2B subtype is a low affinity receptor, which couples to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and also leads to a rise in intracellular calcium modulating important physiological processes. Adenosine exhibiting activity at this subtype is at concentrations greater than 10 μM. The A2B receptors show a ubiquitous distributions, the highest levels are present in ceeum, colon and bladder, followed by blood vessels, mast cells and lung. Through A2B receptors, adenosine also regulates the growth of smooth muscle cell populations in blood vessels, cell growth, intestinal function, inhibition of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α), vascular tone, and inflammatory processes such as diarrhea and asthma. Potent and selective adenosine agonists are the result of modifications of the parent ligand adenosine by substitution, namely at N6 or C2 position of the purine heterocycle or at the 5′ position of the ribose moiety. 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosina (NECA) is one of the most potent A2B adenosine receptor agonist,.

This paper summarizes results from that program from 1998 to 2003 with respect to terrestrial animals in the Canadian Arctic. The arctic terrestrial environment has few significant contaminant issues, particularly when compared with freshwater and marine environments. Both current and historical industrial activities in the north may have a continuing effect on biota in the immediate area, but effects tend to be localized. An investigation of arctic ground squirrels at a site in the Northwest Territories that had historically received applications of DDT concluded that DDT in arctic ground squirrels livers was the result of contamination and that this is an indication of the continuing effect of a local point source of DDT. Arsenic concentrations were higher in berries collected from areas around gold mines in the Northwest Territories than from control sites, suggesting that gold mining may significantly affect arsenic levels in berries in the Yellowknives Dene traditional territory. Although moose and caribou from the Canadian Arctic generally carry relatively low contaminant burdens, Yukon moose had high renal selenium concentrations, and moose and some woodland caribou from the same area had high renal cadmium levels, which may put some animals at risk of toxicological effects. Low hepatic copper levels in some caribou herds may indicate a shortage of copper for metabolic demands, particularly for females. Similarities in patterns of temporal fluctuations in renal element concentrations for moose and caribou suggest that environmental factors may be a major cause of fluctuations in renal concentrations of some elements. Concentrations of persistent organochlorines and metals in beaver and muskrat from the Northwest Territories, and carnivores from across the Canadian Arctic were very low and considered normal for terrestrial wildlife. Two new classes of persistent fluorinated contaminants, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) were found in arctic carnivores and were most abundant in arctic fox and least abundant in mink. Although trace element concentrations in king and common eider ducks were low and not of toxicological concern, the number of nematode parasites in common eiders was positively correlated with total and organic mercury concentrations. Future research should focus on cadmium in moose and caribou, mercury in caribou, and emerging contaminants, with an effort to sample moose and caribou annually where possible to explore the role of naturally occurring cycles in apparent temporal trends. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic evidence map (SEM) is to summarize the epidemiology evidence on approximately 150 lesser studied PFAS prioritized by the EPA for tiered toxicity testing, facilitating interpretation of those results as well as identification of priorities for risk assessment and data gaps for future research. METHODS: The Populations, Exposure, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were intentionally broad to identify studies of any health effects in humans with information on associations with exposure to the identified PFAS. Systematic review methods were used to search for literature that was screened using machine-learning software and manual review. Studies meeting the PECO criteria underwent quantitative data extraction and evaluation for risk of bias and sensitivity using the Integrated Risk Information System approach. RESULTS: 193 epidemiology studies were identified, which included information on 15 of the PFAS of interest. The most commonly studied health effect categories were metabolic (n = 37), endocrine (n = 30), cardiovascular (30), female reproductive (n = 27), developmental (n = 26), immune (n = 22), nervous (n = 21), male reproductive (n = 14), cancer (n = 12), and urinary (n = 11) effects. In study evaluation, 120 (62%) studies were con-sidered High/Medium confidence for at least one outcome. DISCUSSION: Most of the PFAS in this SEM have little to no epidemiology data available to inform evaluation of potential health effects. Although exposure to the 15 PFAS that had data was fairly low in most studies, these less-studied PFAS may be used as replacements for “legacy” PFAS, leading to potentially greater exposure. It is impractical to generate epidemiology evidence to fill the existing gaps for all potentially relevant PFAS. This SEM highlights some of the important research gaps that currently exist. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

This paper reviews quantification of [NH3] through measurements, satellite-remote-sensing, and modeling reported in over 500 publications towards synthesizing the current knowledge of [NH3], focusing on spatiotemporal variations, controlling processes, and quantification issues. Most measurements are through regional passive sampler networks. [NH3] hotspots are typically over agricultural regions, such as the Midwest US and the North China Plain, with elevated concentrations reaching monthly averages of 20 and 74 ppbv, respectively. Topographical effects dramatically increase [NH3] over the Indo-Gangetic Plains, North India and San Joaquin Valley, US. Measurements are sparse over oceans, where [NH3] ≈ a few tens of pptv, variations of which can affect aerosol formation. Satellite remote-sensing (AIRS, CrIS, IASI, TANSO-FTS, TES) provides global [NH3] quantification in the column and at the surface since 2002. Modeling is crucial for improving understanding of NH3 chemistry and transport, its spatiotemporal variations, source apportionment, exploring physicochemical mechanisms, and predicting future scenarios. GEOS-Chem (global) and FRAME (UK) models are commonly applied for this. A synergistic approach of measurements↔satellite-inference↔modeling is needed towards improved understanding of atmospheric ammonia, which is of concern from the standpoint of human health and the ecosystem. © 2020 by the authors.

Fluorinatedβ-amino acids serve as precursors for the β-lactam antibiotics and fluoroalkene dipeptide isosteres or as structural components of analogues of natural products. There are several general methods available for introducing into β-amino acids either one or two fluorine atoms at the -position, as well as α- or β-fluoroalkyl substituents; these methods include reduction of fluorinated β-imino esters, biomimetic transamination of fluorinated carbonyl compounds, Michael-type addition to trifluorocrotonate and α-trifluoromethacrylate derivatives, and Reformatsky and Mannich-type reactions of fluorinated substrates. Fluorinated aziridines and β-lactams have been employed as synthetic intermediates for the preparation of the corresponding β-amino acids by facile ring-opening reactions.

The very large number of CECs reported in the literature makes it difficult to interpret potential risks as well as the removal efficiencies, especially for the more recalci-trant compounds. As such, there is a need for indicator compounds that are representative of CECs detected in systems worldwide. In an effort to develop such a list, five criteria were used to address the potential for applying indicator compounds; these criteria include usage, occurrence, resistance to treatment, persistence, and physicochemical properties that shed light on the potential degradability of a class of compounds. Additional constraints applied included the feasibility of procuring and analyzing compounds. In total, 22 CECs belonging to 13 groups were selected as indicator compounds. These compounds include acetaminophen and ibuprofen (analgesic); erythromycin, sulfamethox-azole, and trimethoprim (antibiotics); diazepam and fluoxetine (antidepressants); carbamazepine (antiepileptic); atenolol and propranolol (β-blockers); gemfibrozil (blood lipid regulator); tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP) (fire retardant); cotinine (nicotine metabolite); atrazine, metolachlor, and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) (pesticides); 17β-estradiol and cholesterol (steroids); caffeine (psychomotor stimulant); perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (surfactants); and iopromide (X-ray contrast agent). These thirteen groups of compounds represent CECs with the greatest resistance to treatment processes, most persistent in surface waters, and detected with significant frequency throughout the water cycle. Among the important implications of using indicator compounds are the ability to better understand the efficacy of treatment processes as well as the transport and fate of these compounds in the environment. © 2021 by the authors.

Radiofrequency, with typically used frequencies of approximately 500 kHz, does not cause pain and is unlikely to induce atrial or ventricular fibrillation. It can be used either to ablate (higher power (35-50W); longer duration of application (90-120 sec); lower voltage (30-50V)) or to perforate (lower power (5-10W) shorter duration of application (1-5 sec), higher voltage (150-280V)). In the past, perforating radiofrequency has been applied to establish right ventricular outflow tract patency in pulmonary atresia with intact septum and with ventricular septal defect.
