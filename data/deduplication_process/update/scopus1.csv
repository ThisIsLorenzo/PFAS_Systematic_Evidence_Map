Among different energy resources, fossil fuels meet more than 80 % of the energy demand. The factors such as the depletion of fossil fuel reserves, the unstable price of fossil fuels, and the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) due to the burning of fuels draw researchers’ attention towards the development of renewable and sustainable fuels. In this context, biomass may fill the gap between energy demand and petroleum availability in the foreseeable future. Moreover, half of this bioenergy comes from conventional uses of biomass, primarily in cooking and heating, as well as within small-scale industries (such as charcoal kilns and brick kilns). The Biomass-to-Liquid (BTL) technology using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) and the Methanol process offers advantages over the traditional use of biomass. The FT/Methanol process is a propitious route to produce carbon-neutral, ultra-clean fuels that generate regulated emissions, including NOx, SOx, and PM. In this article, we have reviewed the processes of biomass gasification, syngas cleaning and conditioning, FTS and methanol synthesis. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",

They are used in a wide array of products and are found in living organisms around the world. Some PFAS have been associated with cancer, developmental toxicity, endocrine disruption, and other health effects. Only a fraction of PFAS are currently monitored and regulated and the presence and effects on aquatic organisms of many PFAS are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the health effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of PFAS on aquatic organisms at different consumer trophic levels through a systematic review and meta-analysis. The main result shows that PFAS in concentrations up to 13.5 μg/L have adverse effects on body size variables for secondary consumers. However, no significant effects on liver or gonad somatic indices and neither on fecundity were found. In addition, the results show that there are large research gaps for PFAS effects on different organisms in aquatic environments at environmentally relevant concentrations. Most studies have been performed on secondary consumers and there is a substantial lack of studies on other consumers in aquatic ecosystems. © 2022 The Authors","Aquatic ecosystems; Aquatic environments; Exposure effects; Health effects; Meta-analysis; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Secondary consumers; Substance concentrations; Synthetic chemicals; Systematic Review; Trophic level; Aquatic organisms; cancer; concentration (composition); endocrine disruptor; meta-analysis; toxicity; trophic level; aquatic environment; aquatic species; body size; consumer; controlled study; environmental exposure; fertility; gonad; human; liver; meta analysis; nonhuman; review; systematic review; trophic level; aquatic species; ecosystem; fluorocarbon; Aquatic Organisms; Ecosystem; Fluorocarbons"

PFAS have been widely used for many decades, and the persistence and potential toxicity of PFAS are an emerging concern in the world. PFAS exposed via diet can be readily absorbed by the intestine and enter the circulatory system or accumulate directly at intestinal sites, which could interact with the intestine and cause the destruction of intestinal barrier. This review summarizes current relationships between PFAS exposure and intestinal barrier damage with a focus on more recent toxicological studies. Exposure to PFAS could cause inflammation in the gut, destruction of the gut epithelium and tight junction structure, reduction of the mucus layer, and induction of the toxicity of immune cells. PFAS accumulation could also induce microbial disorders and metabolic products changes. In addition, there are limited studies currently, and most available studies converge on the health risk of PFAS exposure for human intestinal disease. Therefore, more efforts are deserved to further understand potential associations between PFAS exposure and intestinal dysfunction and enable better assessment of exposomic toxicology and health risks for humans in the future. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cardiovascular system; Risk assessment; Toxicity; 'current; Circulatory systems; Gastrointestinal Disease; Intestinal barriers; Intestinal microflora; Microflorae; Natural environments; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Synthetic organic compounds; Health risks; chemical compound; perfluoroalkanoic acid; perfluorodecane sulfonate; perfluoroheptanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonamide; perfluoropentanoic acid; perfluorotridecanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; perpolyfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; organic compound; dietary intake; digestive system disorder; future prospect; health impact; health risk; metabolism; organic compound; pollution effect; pollution exposure; polymer; toxicology; celiac disease; cell structure; chemical parameters; Crohn disease; drug absorption; drug distribution; drug excretion; drug metabolism; drug transport; enteropathy; environmental exposure; environmental impact; gastritis; gastrointestinal toxicity; health hazard; human; immune system; immunocompetent cell; immunotoxicity; intestine epithelium; microbiology; nonhuman; physical parameters; Review; tight junction; toxicology; ulcerative colitis; chemistry; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Organic Chemicals"

Howbeit, the current literature lacks a comprehensive and comparative overview of the various degradation pathways and mechanisms. This systematic review compiles and analyzes the mechanisms and degradation pathways of PFAS by persulfate activation, photocatalysis, UV/sulfite, electron beam, electrochemical oxidation, plasma, ozonation, and sonochemical oxidation. We found that the degradation pathways of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and Perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids (PFSAs) were investigated more than any other PFAS. This review implies that the defluorination and degradation pathways of PFAS are reliant on the type of dominant reactive oxidant or reductive species. For instance, holes usually oxidize PFAS to unstable perfluoroalkyl radicals accompanied by losing head groups, whereas hydroxyl and superoxide radicals cleave C–C and C-F bonds. On the other hand, hydrated electrons directly eliminate the head group followed by releasing CF2 units. Furthermore, the imposed crystal facets and functional groups of the introduced catalytic surfaces in the case of heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., photocatalysts) affected the degradation pathways and defluorination rates by anchoring PFAS molecules from the head groups (e.g., carboxylate and sulfonate group). This study lays the groundwork for future research to analyze and elucidate the transformation products and pathways of PFAS in various treatment systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Carboxylation; Catalysis; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Advanced Oxidation Processes; AOP; Critical review; Defluorination; Degradation pathways; Head groups; Oxidation and reduction; Perfluoroalkyl substances; PFOA; Reduction process; Electrochemical oxidation"

The main objective of this review is to discuss the influence of the human population on the concentration, distribution and biological effects of PPCPs across the Antarctic coastal marine ecosystem. We carried out a review of the scientific articles published for PPCPs in Antarctic, supported by the information of the Antarctic stations reported by Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (CONMAP), Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty (ATS). In addition, spatial data regarding the Antarctic continent was obtained from Quantarctica. Antarctic concentrations of PPCPs were more reflective of the treatment system used by research stations as opposed to the infrastructure built or the annual occupancy by station. The main problem is that most of the research stations lack tertiary treatment, resulting in elevated concentrations of PPCPs in effluents. Furthermore, the geographic distribution of Antarctic field stations in coastal areas allows for the release of PPCPs, directly into the sea, a practice that remains in compliance with the current Protocol. After their release, PPCPs can become incorporated into sea ice, which can then act as a chemical reservoir. In addition, there is no clarity on the effects on the local biota. Finally, we recommend regulating the entry and use of PPCPs in Antarctica given the difficulties of operating, and in some cases the complete absence of appropriate treatment systems. Further studies are needed on the fate, transport and biological effects of PPCPs on the Antarctic biota. It is recommended that research efforts be carried out in areas inhabited by humans to generate mitigation measures relative to potential adverse impacts. Tourism should be also considered in further studies due the temporal release of PPCPs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystems; Effluents; Geographical distribution; Reservoirs (water); Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Antarctica; Biological effects; Coastal seawater; Coastal waters; Pharmaceutical and personal care product; Pharmaceutical and personal care products; Research stations; Treatment systems; Waste water treatment plants; Wastewater treatment plant; Sea ice; chemical agent; pharmaceutical and personal care product; unclassified drug; cosmetic; drug; bioaccumulation; coastal water; marine ecosystem; pollution effect; PPCP; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; water pollution; Antarctica; coastal waters; concentration (parameter); geographic distribution; pollutant; Review; sea ice; seashore; wastewater; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; human; pollutant; procedures; wastewater; water pollutant; Antarctica; Antarctic Regions; Cosmetics; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Although actual increased incidence versus improved diagnosis remains controversial, the increased prevalence of ASD suggests non-inherited factors as likely contributors. There is increasing epidemiologic evidence that abnormal maternal thyroid function during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of child ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is known to disrupt thyroid function and can affect early brain development; thus, thyroid dysfunction is hypothesized to mediate this relationship. The concept of a potential pathway from prenatal PFAS exposure through thyroid dysfunction to ASD etiology is not new; however, the extant literature on this topic is scant.

Peritoneal oxygenation has significant potential for treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. It could offer an effective treatment for rescue ventilation in critically unwell patients. Further large animal studies are needed with further refinement of currently available techniques. What is the implication of the main finding? We propose the further development of techniques and animal models with an eventual goal of evaluation in humans. Peritoneal oxygenation is a promising alternative to rescue ventilation is cases of extreme hypoxia. The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the difficulties that might occur when attempting to oxygenate patients who have suffered a severe pulmonary insult, including in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Traditional mechanical ventilation (MV) is effective; however, in severe cases of hypoxia, the use of rescue therapy, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), may be required but is also associated with significant complexity and complications. In this review, we describe peritoneal oxygenation; a method of oxygenation that exploits the peritoneum’s gas exchange properties in a fashion that is similar to peritoneal dialysis and has shown considerable promise in animal models. We have conducted a review of the available literature and techniques, including intraperitoneal perfluorocarbons, intraperitoneal jet ventilation, a continuous low-pressure oxygen system (PEROX) and the use of phospholipid-coated oxygen microbubbles (OMBs) through peritoneal microbubble oxygenation (PMO). We conclude that peritoneal oxygenation is a promising technique that warrants further investigation and might be used in clinical settings in the future. © 2022 by the authors.","oxygen; animal; artificial ventilation; human; lung; peritoneum; procedures; therapy; Animals; COVID-19; Humans; Lung; Oxygen; Peritoneum; Respiration, Artificial"

They are widely used in industrial and consumer applications and are known for their persistence, long-distance migration and toxicity. Various PFASs have been manufactured and distributed over the years at a global scale. Decades of relevant research on these emerging contaminants has revealed that PFASs are bioaccumulative and possibly carcinogenic to animals as well as humans. Following regulations and public concern about their impact on ecosystems and uncertain environmental fate, some legacy PFASs have been banned in some regions e.g. Europe, and their industrial production has switched to alternative fluoroalkyl substances. Recently, novel PFAS classes have been identified in numerous environmental matrices. The high variety of legacy and emerging PFASs across the ecosystems is alarming and calls for an efficient monitoring strategy for the quantitative determination of known substances as well as the elucidation and discovery of new compounds. This is crucial for PFAS management and risk assessment in the environment and merits the attention of regulators. This review reports and discusses the most recent analytical method development for PFASs in air, water, abiotic solid matrices and biological matrices. Various instrumental analysis techniques and screening approaches are presented, explored, and compared on the basis of their efficiency and applicability, together with sampling, pre-treatment and extraction methods.

Remediating PFAS-contaminated soils is primarily limited to immobilization whereby the concentration of PFAS remains practically unaffected. Other remediation techniques include chemical and thermal methods, which are typically associated with very high costs and substantial energy usage requirements. A more cost-effective approach, however, could be to mobilize PFAS from the bulky soil to a medium (e.g., water, sorbents, plants) that can be sequentially treated or properly disposed of. Recent Findings: Soil washing, soil flushing, and liquefractionation are particularly promising mobilization approaches for treating permeable soils by desorbing the PFAS into a solution that can be subsequently treated, with liquefractionation generating the least wastewater volume. For cohesive soils, however, electrokinetic remediation would be more suitable for mobilizing PFAS. Another option could be phytoremediation, resulting in the confinement of PFAS in a small volume of plant parts which can be thermally converted into a valuable product, such as biochar, whereby PFAS is either adsorbed onto the carbonaceous matter or destroyed depending on the temperatures adopted. Summary: This review thoroughly discusses all mobilization techniques that can be used for treating PFAS-contaminated soils, while investigating the possibility of combining such techniques with other approaches to enhance the treatment efficiency. Unfortunately, research on coupling mobilization methods with other remediation techniques for treating PFAS-contaminated soils is significantly lacking, and thus, additional studies on the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches should be carried out while providing cost estimations in terms of removal efficiencies, process longevity, and waste regeneration or disposal. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

PFCs have been detected in drinking water samples, aquatic life, human tissue, and blood serum. This is attributed to their xenobiotic attributes making them environmentally persistent, bio-accumulative, and globally distributed in water receiving bodies, posing serious health problems to aquatic life and human health. This is ascribed to PFCs’ peculiar physicochemical properties of being hydrophobic and oleophobic and their removal process from wastewater streams is different from any other organic pollutants. Therefore, this review summarizes the environmental occurrence and recent developments on microbial degradation of the most detected PFCs, i.e., perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) in water bodies. The available literature suggests that PFOA and PFOS are susceptible to biodegradation by Acidimicrobium sp. strain A6, Pseudomonas parafulva strain YAB1, Pseudomonas plecoglossicidia 2.4-D, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain HJ4. Moreover, the current study presents a summary on phytoremediation of PFOA and PFOS as a sustainable green technology. Despite the extensive work undertaken on bioremediation of PFOA and PFOS by biological processes, the available literature suggests that a lot of work still needs to be carried out aimed at investigating the biodegradation pathway of PFOA and PFOS by both microbial species and plants. © 2022 by the authors.",

About 150 billion m3 of natural gas are flared annually, producing approximately 400 million tons of carbon dioxide alone among other greenhouse gases. A search into a viable method for natural gas conversion to methanol becomes imperative not only to save the soul of the ever-changing climate but also to bring an end to wastage of valuable resources by converting hitherto wasted natural gas to wealth. Currently the technologies of conversion of natural gas to methanol could be categorized into the conventional and the innovative technologies. The conventional technology is sub-divided into the indirect method also called the Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) method and the direct method. The major commercial technology currently in use for production of methanol from methane is the FTS method which involves basically two steps which are the steam reforming and the syngas hydrogenation steps. The FTS method is highly energy intensive and this is a factor responsible for its low energetic efficiency. The direct conversion of methane to methanol is a one-step partial oxidation and lower temperature method having higher energetic efficiency advantage over the FTS method. The direct method occurs at temperature range of 380–470 °C and pressure range of 1–5 MPa while the FTS occurs at temperature range of 700–1100 °C and atmospheric pressure. Both methods are carried out under effect of metallic oxide catalysts such as Mo, V, Cr, Bi, Cu, Zn, etc. The innovative methods which include electrochemical, solar and plasma irradiation methods can be described as an approach to either of the two conventional methods in an innovative way while the biological method is a natural process driven by methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzyme released by methanotrophic bacteria. The aim of this study is to review the current state of the technology for conversion of methane to methanol so as to make abreast the recent advances and challenges in the area. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Greenhouse gases; Inert gases; Metals; Methane; Methanol; Natural gas deposits; Steam reforming; Conversion of methanes; Direct method; Energetic efficiency; Gas to methanols; Hydrocarbon production; Selectivity; Synthesis method; Temperature range; Yield; ]+ catalyst; Natural gas"

However, there is a large gap in the knowledge about the impact of EDCs on ovarian function, including the process of ovulation. Defects in ovulation are the leading cause of infertility in women, and EDC exposures are contributing to the prevalence of infertility. Thus, investigating the effects of EDCs on the ovary and ovulation is an emerging area for research and is the focus of this review. The effects of EDCs on gametogenesis, uterine function, embryonic development, and other aspects of fertility are not addressed to focus on ovarian- and ovulation-related fertility issues. Herein, findings from epidemiological and basic science studies are summarized for several EDCs, including phthalates, bisphenols, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, flame retardants, parabens, and triclosan. Epidemiological literature suggests that exposure is associated with impaired fecundity and in vitro fertilization outcomes (decreased egg yield, pregnancies, and births), while basic science literature reports altered ovarian follicle and corpora lutea numbers, altered hormone levels, and impaired ovulatory processes.

In the present study, PPs have been considered one of the emerging pollutants (EPs) and a cause of concern in river health assessment. Beyond the reported increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ABRB), PPs have been found adversely affecting the biotic diversity in such water environments. Considering Algae, Macroinvertebrates, and Fishes as three distinct trophic level indicators, the present study puts forward a framework for showing River Health Condition (RHC) based on the calculation of a River Health Index (RHI). The RHI is calculated using six Indicator Group Scores (IGS) which individually reflect river health in a defined category of water quality characteristics. While Dissolved Oxygen Related Parameters (DORP), Nutrients (NT), and PPs are taken as causative agents affecting RHCs, scores of Algal-Bacterial (AB) symbiosis, Macroinvertebrates (MI), and Fishes (F) are considered as an effect of such environmental conditions. Current wastewater treatment technologies are also not very effective in the removal of PPs. The objective of the present study is to review the harmful effects of PPs on the aquatic environment, particularly on the chemical and biotic indicators of river health. Based on predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) for algae, macroinvertebrates, and fishes in the aquatic environment and measured environmental concentration (MEC) in the river, the estimated risk quotient (RQ) for norfloxacin in the Isakavagu-Nakkavagu stream of river Godavari, Hyderabad is found 293 for algae, 39 for MI, and 335 for fish. Among PPs, in Indian rivers, the presence of caffeine is the most frequent, with algae at the highest level of risk (RQmax= 24.5). Broadly six PPs, including azithromycin, caffeine, diclofenac, naproxen, norfloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole are found above PNEC values in Indian rivers. The application of IGS and RHI in understanding and presenting the river health condition (RHC) through colored hexagons has been demonstrated for the river Ganga near Varanasi (India) as an example. Identification of critical indicator groups, based on IGS provides a scientific basis for planned intervention for river health restoration to achieve an acceptable category. © 2022","amoxicillin; amphetamine; ampicillin; anticonvulsive agent; azithromycin; caffeine; carbamazepine; central stimulant agent; ciprofloxacin; diclofenac; dissolved oxygen; hydrogen peroxide; ibuprofen; ketoprofen; naproxen; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; norfloxacin; ofloxacin; paracetamol; sparfloxacin; sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim; drug; alga; antibiotic resistance; aquatic environment; dissolved oxygen; drug; fish; macroinvertebrate; manufacturing; nutrient; pollutant; river pollution; wastewater; Advanced Oxidation Process; alcohol withdrawal syndrome; Algae Berger Parker index; antibiotic resistance bacteria; antibiotic resistant bacteria; aquaculture; backache; bioaccumulation; bioremediation; bipolar disorder; calculation; conceptual framework; controlled study; conventional activated sludge; depression; dissociation constant; dissolved oxygen related parameter; drug manufacture; electric conductivity; emerging pollutant; environmental risk; estimated risk quotient; fever; fish; Fish Berger Parker index; headache; Health Assessment Questionnaire; hospital wastewater; Indicator Group Score; macroinvertebrate; mania; measured environmental concentration; nonhuman; nutrient; pain; pharmaceutical care; pharmaceutical pollutant; photodegradation; predicted no effect concentration; removal efficiency; Review; Risk Quotient; river health; river health condition; River Health Index; sludge; solids retention time; symbiosis; tooth pain; turnover rate; volatilization; waste water management; water pollutant; water pollution; water quality; animal; pollutant; river; Godavari River; India; Animals; Caffeine; Environmental Pollutants; Norfloxacin; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Rivers"

Brazil is a country that produces and consumes many cosmetics, and the treated cosmetic industry wastewaters must meet standards established by Brazilian environmental agencies to be discharged into receiving water bodies. This review seeks to evaluate the characteristics of both raw and treated cosmetic wastewaters and the treatment methods adopted by Brazilian cosmetic industries. It was observed a wide variation of COD and BOD5 values for the raw wastewater samples, e.g. COD varied from 850 to 36,000 mg.L−1. More than 50% of the raw wastewaters showed high biodegradability, since BOD5/COD ratio was above 0.37. Conventional treatments have met a minimum 60% removal levels for BOD5, according to current federal legislation. However, few samples fell within the most restrictive state legislation limits, and treatments were not effective in eliminating wastewater toxicity. Interestingly, COD and BOD5 values for raw and treated wastewaters could be linearly correlated (R2 values &gt; 0.8). The straight-line equations obtained in this work can be used to estimate BOD5 from COD data, since the latter is easier to obtain. Regarding alternative treatments evaluated in bench-scale, Fenton processes and electrocoagulation have removed more than 90% of COD in raw cosmetic industry wastewaters.

Seafood consumption is thought to be an underappreciated source of PFAS exposure in the general population. This review synthesizes the current understanding of PFAS occurrence in shellfish, a term used to describe animals such as mollusk bivalves, certain gastropods (snails), cephalopods (e.g., octopuses and squid), and crustaceans, and highlights scientific gaps relative to bioaccumulation and the protection of shellfish consumers. Recent findings: A range of sampling methodologies are used across studies, and the suite of PFAS surveyed across studies is highly variable. Concentrations of PFAS observed in shellfish vary by geographic location, shellfish species, habitat, and across PFAS compounds, and studies informing estimates of bioaccumulation of PFAS in shellfish are extremely limited at this time. Summary: This review identifies several important opportunities for researchers to standardize PFAS sampling techniques, sample preparation, and analytical methodologies to allow for better comparison of PFAS analytes both within and across future studies. Increasing the range of geographic locations where samples are collected is also a critical priority to support a greater knowledge of worldwide PFAS contamination. When put into the context of risk to consumer, concentrations of PFAS, especially PFOS, found in shellfish collected from sites containing aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) and industrial contamination may present risks to frequent consumers. Further research is needed to protect shellfish consumers and to inform shellfish advisories and health protective policies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","health care policy; human; Health Policy; Humans"

This systematic review aims to assess PFAS associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) concentrations in human populations. Method: We systematically searched four online databases, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library for relevant peer-reviewed English language articles published until July 2021. Additional relevant articles identified were also included in the search results. We categorised populations into adults (≥18 years old) and children. Primary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and LDL, HDL, TC, and TG concentrations in the serum, plasma, or whole blood; secondary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and the odds of lipid-related health outcomes. Quantitative synthesis was done by vote counting of the effect directions between concentrations of PFAS and lipids/health outcomes, repeated on articles with sample size >1000. Sign tests were performed to assess the statistical significance of the differences between positive and negative associations. Sensitivity analysis was performed by separating out articles with populations having high concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Quality was assessed with the STROBE checklist and NHBLI Study Quality Assessment Tool. Results: A total of 58 articles were included for review. There was evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with higher concentrations of LDL, HDL, and TC, particularly for PFOA-LDL, PFOA-TC, PFOS-TC, and PFNA-LDL. Associations between PFAS and TG tended to be negative, especially for perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). Associations between PFAS concentration and the odds of secondary outcomes generally supported a positive association between PFAS and cholesterol concentrations. Conclusion: We found evidence of associations between the concentrations of some PFAS-lipid pairs in human populations. Future research should be conducted on the less well-studied PFAS to explore their effects on human health and in regions where such studies are currently lacking.

In the flat-bottom PBR, areal biomass productivities decreased from 6.8 to 4.2 g·m−2·d−1 when the flow rate of a culture per unit of lane width was increased from 33 to 132 L·m−1·min−1. We found that this decrease in the areal productivity was the result of a decrease in the volumetric photon flux densities (volumetric PFDs), which was caused by an increase in the depth of the culture in the lane. Through CFD calculation and long-exposure photography, the flow of the culture in the wavy-bottom PBR was characterized in an upper straightforward section and underneath the swirling section. Under identical conditions of flow rate and volumetric PFD (66 L·m−1·min−1 and 50 μmol·m−3·s−1, respectively), the cell growth accelerated in the wavy-bottom PBR with areal productivity that reached 6.5 g·m−2·d−1—productivity was 5.1 g·m−2·d−1 in the flat-bottom PBR. The swirling flow in the wave troughs held the culture for longer periods in the illuminated lane, and the resultant extended period of mixing improved the photosynthetic productivity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cell proliferation; Computational fluid dynamics; Mass transfer; Photobioreactors; Productivity; Biomass productivity; Cascade photobioreactor; Chlorella sorokiniana; Flow regimes; Fluid-flow; Fluid-flow regime; Photobiore-actor; Photon flux densities; Photosynthetic productivity; Volumetrics; Flow of fluids; biomass; cell growth; Chlorella sorokiniana; computational fluid dynamics; density; flow rate; fluid flow; fungal cell; fungus culture; nonhuman; photography; photon; photosynthesis; Review; volumetry"

The isomeric distribution of PFASs in the environment and source waters is largely controlled by the source of contamination and varying physicochemical properties imparted by their structural differences. For example, branched isomers of PFOS are relatively more reactive and less sorptive compared to the linear analogue. As a result, the removal of branched and linear PFASs during water treatment can vary, and thus the isomeric distribution in source waters can influence the overall efficiency of the treatment process. In this paper, we highlight the need to consider the isomeric distribution of PFASs in contaminated matrices while designing appropriate remediation strategies.

This review article emphasizes the importance of perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) polymer-based proton exchange membranes (PEMs) for fuel cell applications and their recent achievements, difficulties, and prospects. The most widely used PEMs for low-temperature PEMFCs are PFSA polymer-based membranes and some non-fluorinated polymers such as sulfonated poly(ether ketone) (SPEEK), sulfonated polysulfone (SPSF), sulfonated polyimide (SPI), and sulfonated polystyrene (SPS). Among these PEMs, PFSA membranes (such as Nafion) are the most often utilized low-temperature PEM for fuel cell applications because of their outstanding chemical, mechanical, and thermal stability with higher proton conductivity under-hydrated conditions. Due to some limitations of PFSA membranes, such as poor conductivity in anhydrous conditions, high manufacturing costs, and degradation of their properties at higher temperatures, research on low-temperature PEM has been shifted to the development of polymer electrolyte composite membranes incorporating various multifunctional organic, inorganic, and hybrid fillers. The PFSA polymer composite membranes show better chemical, thermal, and oxidative stability with higher proton conductivity and fuel cell performance than pristine PFSA membranes. In addition, the PFSA polymer composite membranes maintain proton conductivity and fuel cell performance in low humidity conditions. These findings show that developing suitable PFSA polymer composite membranes could enhance the possibility of commercial applications of PEMFCs. © 2022",

To overcome this issue, adsorption is viewed as one of the most encouraging innovations for the removal of pollutants. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered to be efficiently adsorbent, because of their porosity, high surface area, fine-Tunable metal clusters, and easy functional surface engineering properties.

The term ‘pollen–food allergy syndrome’ (PFAS) defines a series of clinical symptoms in pollen-sensitised patients after the ingestion of plant-derived food. The symptoms of PFAS range from localised oral symptoms to severe systemic reactions. The exact prevalence of PFAS is uncertain for various reasons, including a wide geographical distribution and the lack of standardised population-based studies. Three highly conserved protein classes responsible for most PFAS cases are the profilin, the pathogenesis-related protein group 10 (PR-10) and non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs). It has been postulated that climate change, pollution and agricultural practices may increase the expression of these and other defence proteins in plants, causing an increase in allergen load exposure. With advances in component-resolved diagnostic testing, the role of these other allergens can now be revealed. The diagnosis of PFAS is multifaceted and includes a comprehensive clinical history focusing on inhalant allergy and potential cross-reactivities combined with different in vitro and in vivo tests.

This review evaluates the application of SAs for the generation of products that can serve as (i) antimicrobial agents or disinfectants, (ii) materials for civil construction, (iii) catalysts, (iv) fertilizers, and (v) secondary adsorbents. The importance of SAs configuration in terms of functional groups, surface area and pore morphology played a crucial role in their reutilization.

The intra-solidification of SAs containing toxic metal pollutants (As3+ and F−) with cementitious materials can effectively reduce their leaching below permissible limits of USEPA standards for their utility as additives in construction work. The existence of transition metal ions (Cu2+, Cr3+/6+, Ni2+) on the surface of SAs boosted activity and selectivity towards the desired product during catalytic oxidation, degradation, and conversion processes. The thermally recycled SAs can assist in the secondary adsorption of pollutants from another waste solution due to a larger surface area (&gt; 1000 m2g−1).

A critical analysis of available literature, primarily pertaining to (i) the composition of the landfill gases and their migration in the LFC system, (ii) experimental and mathematical investigations of the transport mechanism of gas and (iii) the impact of additives to cover soils on transport and fate of gas, has been conducted and presented in this manuscript.

They are structurally diverse but comprise a common chemical feature of at least one (though usually more) perfluorocarbon moiety (–CnF2n–) attached to a functional group such as a carboxylic or sulphonic acid. The strength of the Carbon-Fluorine bond means the compounds do not break down easily and can thus bioaccumulate. PFAS are of high concern to regulators and the public due to their potential toxicity and high persistence. At high exposure levels, PFAS have been implicated in a range of harmful effects on human and environmental health, particularly problems in/with development, cholesterol and endocrine disruption, immune system function, and oncogenesis. However, most environmental toxicology studies use far higher levels of PFAS than are generally found in the environment. Additionally, since the type of exposure, the PFAS used, and the organisms tested all vary between studies, so do the results. Traditional ecotoxicology studies may thus not identify PFAS effects at environmentally relevant exposures. Here we conduct a review of omics-based PFAS exposure studies using laboratory ecotoxicological methodologies and environmentally relevant exposure levels and show that common biochemical response pathways are identified in multiple studies. A major pathway identified was the pentose phosphate shunt pathway. Such molecular markers of sublethal PFAS exposure will greatly benefit accurate and effective risk assessments to ensure that new PFAS regulations can consider the full effects of PFAS exposure on environmental and human health receptors. © 2022 The Authors","Ecology; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Health risks; Industrial chemicals; Molecular biology; 'omics'; Biochemical response; Eco-toxicology; Lipidomics; Metabolomics; PFOA; PFOS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Proteomics; Risks assessments; Risk assessment; chemical pollutant; ecotoxicology; health impact; health risk; metabolism; pollution exposure; proteomics; public health; regulatory approach; alkanesulfonic acid; biological marker; fluoride; fluorocarbon; sulfonic acid derivative; ecotoxicology; human; pollutant; risk assessment; toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Biomarkers; Ecotoxicology; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorides; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Risk Assessment; Sulfonic Acids"

Based on the connections between pet animals, humans, and the environment, pet cats and dogs are often recommended as sentinels for the detection of environmental contaminants and for comorbidity tracking. However, their suitability as sentinels is yet to be established. Persistent organic pollutants and environmental hormones have replaced particulate matter (PM2.5) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in causing indoor air pollution. This review summarises the differences in the types and concentrations of indoor organic environmental pollutants detected in pet dogs and cats. This includes an analysis of the main exposure routes of different types of pollutants. To identify which of the two pet species are better sentinels, cats and dogs were compared based on their metabolic capacities of various indoor organic pollutants. In addition to PM2.5, a range of organic compounds including polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), bromophenols, perfluoroalkyl substances, organochlorine pesticides, fungicides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalic acid esters, organophosphate pesticides, organophosphorus flame retardants, and melamine have been detected in both dogs and cats. Pets often accumulate PBDEs from dust; however, traces of PBDEs are present in their diet. The indoor pollutant contamination levels in internal cats were generally higher than those in dogs. Cats accumulate organic pollutants associated with indoor environments, but they are sensitive to their toxicity because, unlike dogs, cats cannot metabolise most of the accumulated pollutants. Moreover, cats share similar clinical symptoms of thyroid diseases in humans. Based on the above observations of detection of indoor organic pollutants, it could be said that cats are better sentinels than dogs. Copyright © 2022 Ma, Wu, Ding, Wang and Luo.",

These features make high-melting waxes suitable for use in foods, cosmetics, materials processing, electronic machinery, national defense, aviation, medical fields, etc. Considering the fast growth of technology and the electronics industry, the world’s economy relies on the production and utilization of high-quality high-melting waxes. However, most waxes in the world’s current markets are prepared from mineral oils, and such commercial waxes have melting points in the range of 50–70 °C. Considering the rapid consumption of high-melting waxes and specialty waxes, their supply insufficiency is anticipated to exceed 700000 t. High-melting waxes are divided into polyethylene (PE) wax and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) wax, based on synthesis methodology. PE wax can be obtained via the polymerization of ethylene and can also be prepared via the thermal or catalytic cracking of plastics. PE cracking to form waxes, with the advantage of low cost, can effectively solve the problem of “white pollution” and make use of existing catalytic cracking units. However, this process results in high energy consumption to achieve waste polymer depolymerization and exhibits some drawbacks, such as a wide carbon number distribution and high impurity content in the obtained PE waxes. However, there are some new methods for synthesizing PE waxes, such as cross alkane metathesis. The FTS, which uses carbon monoxide and hydrogen as raw materials, realizes the synthesis of waxes through carbon chain growth. Although the high-melting FTS waxes display excellent performance and the technology is gradually maturing, FTS waxes with different melting points are produced by rectification of products with various carbon chain lengths. Nonetheless, PE and FTS waxes are widely used in various industries because of their excellent properties. However, their synthesis is based on petroleum and coal-derived chemical products. Biomass-derived waxes have a narrow melting range due to their precise carbon chain growth process. Based on different application demands, small biomass platform molecules can be functionalized to fabricate biomass-derived waxes with special functions. More importantly, the biomass-based synthesis route is sustainable and in-line with the global values for mitigating carbon dioxide emissions and achieving carbon neutrality. This review discusses the recent advances in the synthesis techniques for high-melting waxes, including PE waxes, FTS waxes, and biomass-derived waxes. Furthermore, the catalysts and reaction mechanisms involved in the synthesis of high-melting waxes are discussed in detail.

On the other hand, cycloaddition reactions offer a superior methodology for stereo-chemically controlled synthesis of heterocycles with a diverse ring size and a variable number of heteroatoms. A comprehensive review of methods based on cycloaddition reactions and applied for construction of fluorinated and/or fluoroalkylated S-heterocycles has not yet been published. For this reason, the main goal of the presented review was to fill the existing gap and to summarize the results published over last six decades. In this context, the [3+2]- and [4+2]-cycloadditions (Huisgen reactions, and Diels–Alder reactions, respectively) are of special importance. Some questions related to the discussed mechanisms of cycloaddition processes observed in reactions with electron deficient, fluorinated substrates (dipolarophiles and dienophiles), and electron-rich sulfur containing counter partners, are of fundamental importance for the development of interpretations of organic reaction mechanisms. © 2022 by the authors.","Agricultural chemicals; Cycloaddition; Lead compounds; Sulfur; Cycloaddition reaction; Fluorinated and fluoroalkylated organic compound; Fluorinated heterocycle; Heterocycles; Medicinal chemistry; Organic reaction mechanisms; Organic synthesis; Polymer Chemistry; Sulfur heterocycles; Sulphur atoms; Organic compounds"

In recent times, considerable progress has been made to build a strong case for iron ore as a viable alternative to traditional iron catalysts. Nevertheless, there are still opportunities to enhance the current iron ore low-temperature Fischer–Tropsch (LTFT) catalysts and pave the way for optimal performing catalysts. In this study, we thoroughly examined the various publications on iron ore catalysts used for FTS and highlighted the research gaps in the studies. The study identified the progress made so far, opportunities, and challenges regarding the use of iron ore as a catalyst in FTS. One of the critical areas that needs to be addressed from the review is establishing the deactivation pathways of these catalyst systems. The application of advanced spectroscopic and computational methods is also suggested to elucidate the relationship between the synthesis conditions, active catalytic sites, reaction intermediates, and catalytic performance to fabricate optimized iron ore LTFT catalysts. © 2022 by the authors.",

While indirect additives can be found in traces in food and come from materials used for packaging, storage, and technological processing of food, direct additives are added to food with a special purpose (canning). The use of additives is justified if it is in accordance with legal regulations and does not pose a health or danger to consumers in the prescribed concentration. However, due to the specificity of the child’s metabolic system, there is a greater risk that the negative effects of the additive will manifest. Considering the importance of the potential negative impact of additives on children’s health and the increased interest in the control and monitoring of additives in food for children, we have reviewed the latest available literature available through PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Expert data were taken from publicly available documents published from January 2010 to April 2022 by internationally recognized professional organizations. It was found that the most frequently present additives in the food consumed by children are bisphenols, phthalates, perfluoroalkyl chemicals, perchlorates, pesticides, nitrates and nitrites, artificial food colors, monosodium glutamate, and aspartame. Increasing literacy about the presence and potential risk through continuous education of parents and young people as well as active monitoring of newly registered additives and harmonization of existing legal regulations by competent authorities can significantly prevent the unwanted effects of additives on children’s health. © 2022 by the authors.","aspartame; fluorine derivative; food additive; food dye; glutamate sodium; nitric acid derivative; nitrite; perchlorate; perfluoroalkyl; pesticide; phenol derivative; phthalic acid derivative; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; food additive; pesticide; additive; child care; nitrate; nitrite; nutritional status; public health; child; child health; child nutrition; data base; food intake; health education; health literacy; human; legal aspect; Review; adolescent; Adolescent; Aspartame; Child; Fluorocarbons; Food Additives; Humans; Nitrites; Perchlorates; Pesticides; Sodium Glutamate"

In this context, the article reviews the occurrence, transport, fate, and electrochemical removal of some selected NSAIDs (diclofenac (DIC), ketoprofen (KTP), ibuprofen (IBU), and naproxen (NPX)) using carbon-based anodes in the aquatic environment. However, no specific protocol has been developed to date, and various approaches have been adopted for the sampling and elimination processes of NSAIDs from wastewater samples. The mean concentration of selected NSAIDs from different countries varies considerably, ranging between 3992–27,061 µg/L (influent wastewater) and 1208–7943 µg/L (effluent wastewater). An assessment of NSAIDs removal efficiency across different treatment stages in various wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been performed. Overall, NSAIDs removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants has been reported to be around 4–89%, 8–100%, 16–100%, and 17–98% for DIC, KTP, NPX, and IBU, respectively. A microbiological reactor (MBR) has been proclaimed to be the most reliable treatment technique for NSAIDs removal (complete removal). Chlorination (81–95%) followed by conventional mechanical biological treatment (CMBT) (94–98%) treatment has been demonstrated to be the most efficient in removing NSAIDs. Further, the present review explains that the electrochemical oxidation process is an alternative process for the treatment of NSAIDs using a carbon-based anode. Different carbon-based carbon anodes have been searched for electrochemical removal of selected NSAIDs. However, boron-doped diamond and graphite have presented reliable applications for the complete removal of NSAIDs from wastewater samples or their aqueous solution. © 2022 by the authors.",

Plant carbonsource (PCS) enhanced denitrification in constructed wetlands (CWs) for wastewater with low chemical oxygen demand to total nitrogen (COD/N) has been one of the most exciting research topics. This paper summarized the related studies with VOSviewer software and found that the major interests were denitrification performance and mechanism in CWs. This article mainly focused on the PCSs’ characteristics, denitrification rate, the influences of key environmental and operational parameters, surface morphology variation, microbial community structure, and denitrification genes. Engineering prospects and existing problems were also introduced. PCSs’ degradation consumes DO and creates favorable conditions for denitrification. The COD/N of wastewater should be maintained at 4–5 by adding PCSs, thus improving denitrification performance and reducing nitrous oxide emission. Aerobic degradation, anaerobic fermentation, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, and sulfate reduction processes may consume the carbon released by PCSs depending on the influent quality and environmental conditions. More attention should be paid to the reduction of greenhouse gases and emerging pollutants in CWs with PCSs. © 2022 by the authors.","carbon; constructed wetland; denitrification; gene; literature review; nitrous oxide; pollutant removal; wastewater; wastewater treatment"

The project aims to provide urban planners with information on the remediation of vacant lands using urban runoff pollutant removal techniques. To find the most effective removal method, relevant scholarly papers and case studies are reviewed to see what types of vacant land have many urban runoff pollutants and how to effectively remove contaminants from stormwater runoff in the city by SCMs. The results show that previously developed/used land (but now vacant) has been identified as contaminated sites, including prior residential, commercial, industrial, and parking lot land use from urban areas. SCMs are effective management approaches to reduce nonpoint source pollution problems runoff. It is an umbrella concept that can be used to capture nature-based, cost-effective, and eco-friendly treatment technologies and redevelopment strategies that are socially inclusive, economically viable, and with good public acceptance. Among these removal techniques, a bioretention system tends to be effective for removing dissolved and particulate components of heavy metals and phosphorus. Using different plant species and increasing filter media depth has identified the effectiveness of eliminating nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N). A medium with a high hydraulic conductivity covers an existing medium with low hydraulic conductivity, and the result will be a higher and more effective decrease for phosphorus (P) pollutants. In addition, wet ponds were found to be highly effective at removing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, with removal rates as high as 99%. For the removal of perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) pollutants, despite the implementation of SCMs in urban areas to remove PFAAs and particulate-related contaminants in stormwater runoff, the current literature has little information on SCMs’ removal of PFAAs. Studies have also found that VUL’s size, shape, and connectivity are significantly inversely correlated with the reduction in stormwater runoff. This paper will help planners and landscape designers make efficient decisions around removing pollutants from VUL stormwater runoff, leading to better use of these spaces. © 2022 by the authors.","hydraulic conductivity; literature review; nonpoint source pollution; pollutant removal; redevelopment; runoff; stormwater; urban development"

Opponents are concerned about exposure to hazardous chemicals leaching from the crumb rubber cushioning fill made of recycled tires, the plastic carpet, and other synthetic components. Numerous studies have shown that chemicals identified in artificial turf, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalates, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), are known carcinogens, neurotoxicants, mutagens, and endocrine disruptors. However, few studies have looked directly at health outcomes of exposure to these chemicals in the context of artificial turf. Ecotoxicology studies in invertebrates exposed to crumb rubber have identified risks to organisms whose habitats have been contaminated by artificial turf. Chicken eggs injected with crumb rubber leachate also showed impaired development and endocrine disruption. The only human epidemiology studies conducted related to artificial turf have been highly limited in design, focusing on cancer incidence. In addition, government agencies have begun their own risk assessment studies to aid community decisions. Additional studies in in vitro and in vivo translational models, ecotoxicological systems, and human epidemiology are strongly needed to consider exposure from both field use and runoff, components other than crumb rubber, sensitive windows of development, and additional physiological endpoints.

The crucial step in activating the complement system is the generation and regulation of C3 convertase complexes, which are needed to generate opsonins that promote phagocytosis, to generate C3a that regulates inflammation, and to initiate the lytic terminal pathway through the generation and activity of C5 convertases. A growing body of evidence has highlighted the interplay between the complement system, coagulation system, platelets, neutrophils, and endothelial cells. The kidneys are highly susceptible to complement-mediated injury in several genetic, infectious, and autoimmune diseases. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and lupus nephritis (LN) are both characterized by thrombosis in the glomerular capillaries of the kidneys. In aHUS, congenital or acquired defects in complement regulators may trigger platelet aggregation and activation, resulting in the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the kidneys. Because glomerular vasculopathy is usually noted with immunoglobulin and complement accumulation in LN, complement-mediated activation of tissue factors could partly explain the autoimmune mechanism of thrombosis. Thus, kidney glomerular capillary thrombosis is mediated by complement dysregulation and may also be associated with complement overactivation. Further investigation is required to clarify the interaction between these vascular components and develop specific therapeutic approaches.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic evidence map (SEM) is to summarize the epidemiology evidence on approximately 150 lesser studied PFAS prioritized by the EPA for tiered toxicity testing, facilitating interpretation of those results as well as identification of priorities for risk assessment and data gaps for future research. METHODS: The Populations, Exposure, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were intentionally broad to identify studies of any health effects in humans with information on associations with exposure to the identified PFAS. Systematic review methods were used to search for literature that was screened using machine-learning software and manual review. Studies meeting the PECO criteria underwent quantitative data extraction and evaluation for risk of bias and sensitivity using the Integrated Risk Information System approach. RESULTS: 193 epidemiology studies were identified, which included information on 15 of the PFAS of interest. The most commonly studied health effect categories were metabolic (n = 37), endocrine (n = 30), cardiovascular (30), female reproductive (n = 27), developmental (n = 26), immune (n = 22), nervous (n = 21), male reproductive (n = 14), cancer (n = 12), and urinary (n = 11) effects. In study evaluation, 120 (62%) studies were con-sidered High/Medium confidence for at least one outcome. DISCUSSION: Most of the PFAS in this SEM have little to no epidemiology data available to inform evaluation of potential health effects. Although exposure to the 15 PFAS that had data was fairly low in most studies, these less-studied PFAS may be used as replacements for “legacy” PFAS, leading to potentially greater exposure. It is impractical to generate epidemiology evidence to fill the existing gaps for all potentially relevant PFAS. This SEM highlights some of the important research gaps that currently exist. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Although many studies have reported an association between PFOA exposure and the risk of developing hepatic diseases, it is still in debate because they have shown conflicting results. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the relationship between PFOA exposure and hepatic diseases. Methods: This study searched studies related to hepatic diseases due to PFOA exposure until 31 December 2021, using PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. This study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis through research question development, literature screening, data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation. This study found 8280 studies after excluding duplicate literature and selected 5 studies in the final stage. Among them, two studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results: The results of the meta-analysis showed that the ALT of people exposed to PFOA was 117% higher than the ALT of those not exposed to PFOA, and it was significantly different (OR = 1.167; 95% CI, 1.086–1.254). Conclusion: However, since the number of studies included in the analysis was not large enough to conclude that PFOA exposure was associated with the development of hepatic diseases, more observational studies are needed to confirm its long-term effects. © 2022 by the authors.","perfluorooctanoic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; water; hepatitis; literature review; meta-analysis; persistent organic pollutant; pollution exposure; alanine aminotransferase blood level; data extraction; disease association; exposure; human; liver; liver disease; meta analysis (topic); publication bias; Review; systematic review; meta analysis; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Liver Diseases; Water"

The electro-generated hydrogen peroxide leads to the improvement in ozone transformation to hydroxyl radical; hence, the electro-peroxone can considerably improve the treatment performance, total organic carbon (TOC) mineralization, and reduction of ozone-resistant emerging pollutants compared with the traditional ozonation process. Moreover, the main disadvantage of the traditional ozonation process for water treatment is bromate generation during the treatment of bromide-containing water sources, which can be remarkably decreased by the application of this technology. Additionally, because of its enhanced kinetics of contaminant degradation, electro-peroxone offers a more secure, time-efficient, energy-saving, and effective alternative for the reduction of emerging pollutants, compared with different ozone-dependent AOPs including traditional UV/O3 and peroxone (O3/H2O2) methods. Hence, it can offer a suitable, eco-friendly, and cost-effective approach to markedly enhance the efficiency of the current ozonation process. This paper reviews the principles of the electro-peroxone process and compares its efficiency with other methods. The essential reaction mechanisms and experimental parameters that are crucial to the operation, realization, and design of the electro-peroxone, including ozone dosage, applied current, injected ozone flowrate, electrolyte type, electrode setup, solution pH, and type of cathode and anode on electro-peroxone efficiency, are investigated. Moreover, the application of electro-peroxone for water and wastewater treatment is explored. Finally, the challenges in wide-ranging application of electro-peroxone, the future research direction, and its incorporation in wastewater and water treatment systems for viable application are discussed. © 2022, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.",

Immunomodulation and epigenetic regulation have been hypothesized as mediators of this relationship, but the precise underlying molecular mechanisms are not well-characterized. This review examines the evidence for epigenetic modification at the intersection of COVID-19 and environmental chemical exposures. Recent Findings: Numerous environmental contaminants including air pollutants, toxic metal(loid)s, per- and polyfluorinated substances, and endocrine disrupting chemicals are hypothesized to increase susceptibility to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the risk of severe COVID-19, but few studies currently exist. Drawing on evidence that many environmental chemicals alter the epigenetic regulation of key immunity genes and pathways, we discuss how exposures likely perturb host antiviral responses. Specific mechanisms vary by contaminant but include general immunomodulation as well as regulation of viral entry and recognition, inflammation, and immunologic memory pathways, among others. Summary: Associations between environmental contaminants and COVID-19 are likely mediated, in part, by epigenetic regulation of key immune pathways involved in the host response to SARS-CoV-2. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","endocrine disruptor; adverse event; environmental exposure; genetic epigenesis; genetics; human; COVID-19; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Epigenesis, Genetic; Humans; SARS-CoV-2"

These microbial by-products are harmful compounds that can be present in various environments including air, water, soil, and other ecosystems which were discussed in detail in this review. Environmental and occupational exposure caused by endotoxin occurs in water and wastewater treatment plants, industrial plants, farming, waste recovery, and composting facilities. Even though the health risk related to endotoxin injection in intravenous and dialysis are well identified, the harmful effects of ingestion, inhalation, and other way of exposure are not well quantified and there is insufficient information on the potential health risks of endotoxins exposure in water environments, and another exposure. Because of limited studies, the outbreaks of diseases related to endotoxins in the various source of exposure not been well documented. Endotoxin removal from different environments are investigated in this review. The results of various studies have shown that conventional treatment methods have been unable to remove endotoxins from water and wastewater, therefore, monitoring the effectiveness of these processes in controlling this contaminant and also using the appropriate removal method is essential. However, management of water and wastewater treatment processes and the use of advanced processes such as Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) can be effective in monitoring and reducing endotoxin levels during water and wastewater treatment. One of the limitations of endotoxin monitoring is the lack of sufficient information to develop monitoring levels. In addition, the lack of guidelines and methods of controlling them at high levels may cause irreparable disaster. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental technology; Health; Health risks; Industrial plants; Industrial waste treatment; Industrial water treatment; Process control; Wastewater treatment; Air-water; Bacterial endotoxins; Environmental exposure; Gram-negative bacteria; Health effects; Outer membrane; Remediation technologies; Removal technology; Water and wastewater; Water and wastewater treatments; Bacteria; drinking water; endotoxin; endotoxin; water; bacterium; health impact; occupational exposure; remediation; toxin; wastewater treatment; air pollution; ecosystem restoration; environmental exposure; health care facility; nonhuman; occupational exposure; oxidation; Review; waste component removal; waste water management; waste water recycling; wastewater; water pollution; air pollutant; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; hemodialysis; procedures; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Ecosystem; Endotoxins; Environmental Monitoring; Renal Dialysis; Waste Water; Water"

With over 9000 compounds belonging to this chemical class, there is increasing concern regarding human exposure to these compounds due to their persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic nature. Human exposure to PFAS may occur from a variety of exposure sources, including, air, food, indoor dust, soil, water, from the transfer of PFAS from non-stick wrappers to food, use of cosmetics, and other personal care products. This critical review presents recent research on the health-related impacts of PFAS exposure, highlighting compounds other than Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and Perfluoroctane sulfonate (PFOS) that cause adverse health effects, updates the current state of knowledge on PFAS toxicity, and, where possible, elucidates cause-and-effect relationships. Recent reviews identified that exposure to PFAS was associated with adverse health impacts on female and male fertility, metabolism in pregnancy, endocrine function including pancreatic dysfunction and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, lipid metabolism and risk of childhood adiposity, hepatic and renal function, immune function, cardiovascular health (atherosclerosis), bone health including risk for dental cavities, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deficiency, neurological function, and risk of developing breast cancer. However, while cause-and-effect relationships for many of these outcomes were not able to be clearly elucidated, it was identified that 1) the evidence derived from both animal models and humans suggested that PFAS may exert harmful impacts on both animals and humans, however extrapolating data from animal to human studies was complicated due to differences in exposure/elimination kinetics, 2) PFAS precursor kinetics and toxicity mechanism data are still limited despite ongoing exposures, and 3) studies in humans, which provide contrasting results require further investigation of the long-term-exposed population to better evaluate the biological toxicity of chronic exposure to PFAS. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","perfluoroctane sulfonate; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; chemical substance; comparative study; health impact; knowledge; lipid; metabolism; reaction kinetics; toxicity; acute toxicity; adverse event; bioaccumulation; bone disease; breast cancer; cardiovascular effect; carotid atherosclerosis; childhood; clinical evaluation; comparative study; cytotoxicity; disease association; endocrine function; female fertility; health status; human; immune response; immunotoxicity; kidney dysfunction; kidney function; lipid metabolism; liver dysfunction; liver function; locomotion; long term exposure; male fertility; metabolic regulation; neurologic disease; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; osteoporosis; oxidative stress; pancreas disease; population; pregnancy; reproductive toxicity; respiratory function; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; thyroid function; tooth disease; vitamin D deficiency; animal; dust; female; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Caprylates; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dust; Female; Fluorocarbons; Male; Pregnancy"

Therefore, many studies have modified the surface of less hydrophobic or hydrophilic membranes into super-hydrophobic membranes. However, the use of agents derived from fluoroalkyl silane, although providing high performance, is expensive and not environmentally friendly.

Drug-induced platelet function bleeding disorders are the most frequent PFDs and can easily be identified on the basis of recent administration of platelet-inhibiting drugs. Apart from these, the most challenging acquired PFDs are those caused by autoimmune mechanisms. In fact, demonstration of autoantibodies inhibiting platelet function may be difficult in most non-specialised centres. Among autoimmune PFDs (aPFDs), acquired Glanzmann thrombasthenia (aGT), which is caused by autoantibodies that bind to platelet αIIbβ3 integrin, inhibiting its function, is the most frequent. aGT can be associated with underlying haematological malignancies or autoimmune diseases but can also be idiopathic. More rarely, other immune-mediated PFDs can occur, such as acquired delta storage pool disease (aδSPD). Treatment of aPFDs must rely on the control of acute and chronic bleedings, treatment of the underlying disease in secondary forms, and immunosuppressive treatment for autoantibody reduction or eradication. aPFDs may completely resolve upon treatment of any underlying disease that may be present. In primary aPFDs, and in the majority of secondary forms, treatment relies on immunosuppressive therapies.Here we present a systematic review of previously described immune-mediated aGT and aδSPD cases.

The contamination of freshwater through anthropogenic activities and its discharge into the ecosystems leads to the generation of wastewater. Wastewater mainly contains nutrient loads and the recent emerging contaminants such as pharmaceutical wastes, drugs, micropollutants, heavy metals, pesticides, phenolic compounds, and dyes have increased and contaminated the aquatic bodies. The existence of these emerging pollutants can cause serious threats to ecosystems and humans. Thus, conventional wastewater treatment was focused on the removal of solid compounds or nutrient loads. However, it could not remove the emerging contaminants and later microalgae that are photosynthetic eukaryotic microorganisms were found to be an efficient and eco-friendly source for the remediation of diverse kinds of wastewater. Apart from nutrient removal, the algal biomass acts as the efficient feedstock for the generation of bioenergy products. However, limited data have been published regarding the remediation of emerging pollutants through microalgae. Thus, focusing on the recent gaps, the current review provides an overview of the potential of microalgae for the remediation of nutrient loads. Critically deliberate the recent advances and detailed summary of microalgae potential for the remediation of wastewaters containing high nutrient loads especially focused on the remediation of different emerging contaminants.

Therefore, the conversion of CO2 by hydrogenation into higher hydrocarbons through the modified Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) has become an important topic of current research and will be discussed in this review. In this process, CO2 is converted into carbon monoxide by the reverse water-gas-shift reaction, which subsequently follows the regular FTS pathway for hydrocarbon formation. Generally, the nature of the catalyst is the main factor significantly influencing product selectivity and activity. Thus, a detailed discussion will focus on recent developments in Fe-based, Co-based, and bimetallic catalysts in this review.

The performance, limitations, and possibilities for the practical implementation of different high-temperature proton exchange membranes (PEMs) utilized in fuel cells are discussed in this review paper. A suitable PEM must be developed to improve the performance of membrane electrode assemblies for high-temperature PEMFCs (working temperature above 100 °C). Various PEMs such as sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK), sulfonated polystyrene (SPS), sulfonated polyimide (SPI), sulfonated polysulfone (SPSU), phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole (PA-PBI), perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) polymer-based membranes have been investigated as PEMs for fuel cell applications by several research groups. Among the various PEMs, PA-PBI membranes are the most promising high-temperature PEM for fuel cell applications because of their higher proton conductivity at high temperatures and anhydrous conditions, good chemical and thermal, mechanical stability, and high durability. However, the performance of high-temperature PEMs based on pristine PA-PBI is insufficient to fulfill the need for practical implementation of high-temperature PEMFCs, which needs to be enhanced further before they can be used commercially. Therefore, PA-PBI composite membranes containing various multifunctional inorganic, organic, and hybrid fillers are being actively explored to produce high-temperature PEMs. The PA-PBI composite membranes’ proton conductivity increases with rising temperature and maintains conductivity in anhydrous conditions, as well as chemical, thermal, and oxidative stability under operating conditions and long-term performance stability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical stability; Composite membranes; Energy conversion efficiency; Ethers; High temperature applications; Ketones; Mechanical stability; Proton conductivity; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Reaction kinetics; Cell-be; Cell/B.E; Cell/BE; Fuel cell application; High temperature proton exchange membrane; High temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells; Highest temperature; Phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole; Polybenzimidazole; Proton exchange membranes; Fossil fuels; Ethers; Fossil Fuels; Ketones; Membranes; Performance; Polybenzimidazoles; Reaction Kinetics; Temperature"

Studies have shown that H2O2 production is significantly increased in the non-inflamed colonic epithelium of individuals with UC. H2O2 is a powerful neutrophilic chemo-tactic agent that can diffuse through colonic epithelial cell membranes creating an interstitial chemotactic molecular “trail” that attracts adjacent intra-vascular neutrophils into the colonic epithelium leading to mucosal inflammation and UC. A novel therapy aimed at removing the inappropriate H2O2 mediated chemotactic signal has been highly effective in achieving complete histologic resolution of colitis in patients experiencing refractory disease with at least one (biopsy-proven) histologic remission lasting 14 years to date. The evidence implies that therapeutic intervention to prevent the re-establishment of a pathologic H2O2 mediated chemotactic signaling gradient will indefinitely preclude neutrophilic migration into the colonic epithelium constituting a functional cure for this disease. Cumulative data indicate that individuals with UC have normal immune systems and current treatment guidelines calling for the suppression of the immune response based on the belief that UC is caused by an underlying immune dysfunction are not supported by the evidence and may cause serious adverse effects. It is the aim of this paper to present experimental and clinical evidence that identifies H2O2 produced by the colonic epithelium as the causal agent in the pathogenesis of UC. A detailed explanation of a novel therapeutic intervention to normalize colonic H2O2, its rationale, components, and formulation is also provided. ©The Author(s) 2022.

This hypothesis is tested by comparing the levels of four selected perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) (i.e., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA)) in various global environmental media (i.e., rainwater, soils, and surface waters) with recently proposed guideline levels. On the basis of the four PFAAs considered, it is concluded that (1) levels of PFOA and PFOS in rainwater often greatly exceed US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Lifetime Drinking Water Health Advisory levels and the sum of the aforementioned four PFAAs (ς4 PFAS) in rainwater is often above Danish drinking water limit values also based on ς4 PFAS; (2) levels of PFOS in rainwater are often above Environmental Quality Standard for Inland European Union Surface Water; and (3) atmospheric deposition also leads to global soils being ubiquitously contaminated and to be often above proposed Dutch guideline values. It is, therefore, concluded that the global spread of these four PFAAs in the atmosphere has led to the planetary boundary for chemical pollution being exceeded. Levels of PFAAs in atmospheric deposition are especially poorly reversible because of the high persistence of PFAAs and their ability to continuously cycle in the hydrosphere, including on sea spray aerosols emitted from the oceans. Because of the poor reversibility of environmental exposure to PFAS and their associated effects, it is vitally important that PFAS uses and emissions are rapidly restricted. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

PFAS cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. Thus, PFAS are a likely risk for neurotoxicity. Studies that measured PFAS levels in the brains of humans, polar bears, and rats have demonstrated that some areas of the brain accumulate greater amounts of PFAS. Moreover, in humans, there is evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and an increased cause of death from Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease in elderly populations. Given possible links to neurological disease, critical analyses of possible mechanisms of neurotoxic action are necessary to advance the field. This paper critically reviews studies that investigated potential mechanistic causes for neurotoxicity including (1) a change in neurotransmitter levels, (2) dysfunction of synaptic calcium homeostasis, and (3) alteration of synaptic and neuronal protein expression and function. We found growing evidence that PFAS exposure causes neurotoxicity through the disruption of neurotransmission, particularly the dopamine and glutamate systems, which are implicated in age-related psychiatric illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases. Evaluated research has shown there are highly reproduced increased glutamate levels in the hippocampus and catecholamine levels in the hypothalamus and decreased dopamine in the whole brain after PFAS exposure. There are significant gaps in the literature relative to the assessment of the nigrostriatal system (striatum and ventral midbrain) among other regions associated with PFAS-associated neurologic dysfunction observed in humans. In conclusion, evidence suggests that PFAS may be neurotoxic and associated with chronic and age-related psychiatric illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, it is imperative that future mechanistic studies assess the impact of PFAS and PFAS mixtures on the mechanism of neurotransmission and the consequential functional effects. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","acetylcholine; calcium; calcium channel L type; catecholamine; dopamine; glutamate receptor; glutamic acid; monoamine; neurotransmitter; perfluoro compound; dopamine; fluorocarbon; glutamic acid derivative; Alzheimer disease; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; behavior; bioaccumulation; blood; brain; brain region; calcium cell level; calcium current; calcium homeostasis; calcium signaling; corpus striatum; degenerative disease; hippocampus; human; hypothalamus; mental disease; monoamine metabolism; nerve degeneration; neurotoxicity; neurotransmission; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; protein expression; protein function; Review; synapse; ventral mesencephalon; aged; animal; child; metabolism; pollutant; rat; synaptic transmission; toxicity; toxicity and intoxication; Aged; Animals; Child; Dopamine; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Glutamates; Humans; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Rats; Synaptic Transmission"

This class, comprising of thousands of chemicals, have been used in many different products ranging from firefighting foam to personal care products and clothes. Even at relatively low levels of exposure, PFAS have been linked to various health effects in humans such as lower birth weight, increased serum cholesterol levels, and reduced antibody response to vaccination. Human biomonitoring data demonstrates ubiquitous exposure to PFAS across all age groups. This has been attributed to PFAS-contaminated water and dietary intake, as well as inadvertent ingestion of indoor dust for adults and toddlers. In utero exposure and breast milk have been indicated as important exposure pathways for foetuses and nursing infants. More recently, PFAS have been identified in a wide range of products, many of which come in contact with skin (e.g., cosmetics and fabrics). Despite this, few studies have evaluated dermal uptake as a possible route for human exposure and little is known about the dermal absorption potential of different PFAS. This article critically investigates the current state-of-knowledge on human exposure to PFAS, highlighting the lack of dermal exposure data. Additionally, the different approaches for dermal uptake assessment studies are discussed and the available literature on human dermal absorption of PFAS is critically reviewed and compared to other halogenated contaminants, e.g., brominated flame retardants and its implications for dermal exposure to PFAS.

This article reviews the influence of soil- and water-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the environmental fate of PFAS. In addition to being co-adsorped with PFAS to increase the adsorption capacity, DOM competes with PFAS for adsorption sites on the surface of the material, thereby reducing the removal rate of PFAS or increasing water solubility, which facilitates desorption of PFAS in the soil. It can quench some active species and inhibit the degradation of PFAS. In contrast, before DOM in water self-degrades, DOM has a greater promoting effect on the degradation of PFAS because DOM can complex with iron, iodine, among others, and act as an electron shuttle to enhance electron transfer. In soil aggregates, DOM can prevent microorganisms from being poisoned by direct exposure to PFAS. In addition, DOM increases the desorption of PFAS in plant root soil, affecting its bioavailability. In general, DOM plays a bidirectional role in adsorption, degradation, and plant uptake of PFAS, which depends on the types and functional groups of DOM. It is necessary to enhance the positive role of DOM in reducing the environmental risks posed by PFAS. In future, attention should be paid to the DOM-induced reduction of PFAS and development of a green and efficient continuous defluorination technology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Biogeochemistry; Degradation; Desorption; Dissolution; Luminescence of liquids and solutions; Organic compounds; Soils; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption site; Dissolved organic matter; Dissolved organic matters; Environmental fate; Perfluorinated compound; Perfluorinated compounds; Plant uptake; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Soil and water; Adsorption; dissolved organic matter; iodine; iron; perfluoro compound; polyfunctional group; water; 2,5 dimethoxy 4 methylamphetamine; dissolved organic matter; fluorocarbon; adsorption; biological uptake; chemical substance; dissolved organic matter; environmental degradation; environmental fate; literature review; adsorption; bioavailability; defluorination; desorption; electron transport; environmental impact; environmental risk; photochemistry; photodegradation; plant root; Review; soil; water solubility; adsorption; metabolism; soil pollutant; 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Methylamphetamine; Adsorption; Dissolved Organic Matter; Fluorocarbons; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Water"

Ubiquities and persistence of some PFAS detected in environmental samples (water, soil, air) have attracted much attention and regulatory actions in recent years. This review provides an overview of PFAS use in electronic components; trends in quantities of e-waste generation; PFAS exposure pathways during e-waste handling and processing; reported PFAS in environmental samples and samples of serum, blood, and hair collected from people living near and working at e-waste processing sites. Processes used for manufacturing electronic components (e.g., embedded processes, additive manufacturing) make recycling or materials recovery from discarded electronic units and components very difficult and unfeasible. Exposure during numerous processing steps for materials recovery and scavenging at disposal sites can result in PFAS intake through inhalation, ingestion, and dermal routes. Chemical risk assessment approaches have been continuously evolving to consider chemical-specific dosimetric and mechanistic information. While the metabolic fate of PFAS is not well understood, some PFAS bioaccumulate and bind to proteins (but not to lipids) in biota and humans due to their surface-active characteristics and very low solubility in water and fat. It is difficult to associate the adverse health effects due to exposure to e-waste directly to PFAS as there are other factors that could contribute to the observed adverse effects. However, PFAS have been detected in the samples collected from different environmental compartments (e.g., water, soil, leachate, blood sera, rainwater) at and near e-waste processing sites, landfills, and near electronics and optoelectronics industries indicating that e-waste collection, processing, and disposal sites are potential PFAS exposure locations. Better monitoring of e-waste handling sites and detailed epidemiological studies for at risk populations are needed for assessing potential health risks due to PFAS exposure at these sites. © 2022","organofluorine derivative; fluorocarbon; water; chemical substance; electronic waste; health risk; literature review; performance assessment; pollution exposure; bioaccumulation; e-waste; environmental exposure; health hazard; human; nonhuman; recycling; Review; risk assessment; waste management; electronics; soil; Electronic Waste; Electronics; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Soil; Water"

PFAS consist of a large family of synthetic chemicals, with over 4000 distinct varieties having been identified and around 250 currently being manufactured at globally relevant levels. Numerous epidemiological studies have linked exposure to PFAS with adverse health effects ranging from immunotoxicity, cardiometabolic disease, developmental and reproductive effects, cancer, and recently type 2 diabetes. Several studies have demonstrated associations between serum PFAS concentrations and glycemic indicators of type 2 diabetes including glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR in adolescent and adult cohorts. In addition, some studies have shown positive associations with incident type 2 diabetes and multiple PFAS. However, the link between PFAS exposure and the development of diabetes continues to be a disputed area of study, with conflicting data having been reported from various epidemiological studies. In this mini review we will summarize the current state of the literature linking PFAS to type 2 diabetes and discuss important future directions including the use of more complex mixtures-based statistical analyses.

Therefore, a detailed review of various heterogeneous catalysts for the conversion of lipids into hydrocarbon fuels with molecular weights and structures suitable for use in aviation is presented herein, with a focus on aspects such as their physical and chemical properties, pore distributions and structures, active sites, key functions, catalytic performance, and pyrolysis mechanisms. Metal oxides can effectively remove oxygen atoms, whereas zeolites can achieve long-carbon-chain cracking to yield desirable gasoline-, kerosene-, or diesel-range fuels. Moreover, zeolites typically permit aromatisation, which yields the aromatic hydrocarbons required for liquid fuels. Modification of the pore structures of zeolites to yield hierarchical pores can improve the production of C8–C16-range liquid fuels to maximise the bio-kerosene yield. Therefore, composite catalysts (metal oxides supported on zeolites with hierarchical pores) can be effective for molecular-level structural modification in the pyrolytic production of alternative aviation fuels using lipids. However, rapid deactivation due to coking, poisoning, and sintering hinder the operation of these catalysts. Coking, which is predominantly responsible for pyrolysis catalyst deactivation, should be targeted in future research on novel catalysts. The synthetic strategy of catalysts and the mitigation of their issues are critical to the design of novel catalytic pyrolysis systems for the efficient cracking of triglyceride-rich feedstock to yield alternative aviation fuels. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Aromatic hydrocarbons; Carbon; Catalyst activity; Catalyst deactivation; Catalyst poisoning; Lipids; Liquids; Molecular oxygen; Pore structure; Sintering; Zeolites; Alternative aviation fuel; Aviation fuel; Catalytic pyrolysis; Composite catalysts; Liquid hydrocarbons; Micro-algae; Non-edible lipid; Oxygen atom; Synthetic strategies; ]+ catalyst; Microalgae"

Patients can also present other extra glandular manifestations, such as arthritis, anaemia and fatigue or various types of organ involvement. Due to its heterogenicity, along with the lack of effective treatments, the diagnosis and management of this disease is challenging. The objective of this review is to summarize recent multi-omic publications aiming to identify biomarkers in tears, saliva and peripheral blood from SS patients that could be relevant for their better stratification aiming at improved treatment selection and hopefully better outcomes. We highlight the relevance of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon (IFN) as biomarkers identified in higher concentrations in serum, saliva and tears. Transcriptomic studies confirmed the upregulation of IFN and interleukin signalling in patients with SS, whereas immunophenotyping studies have shown dysregulation in the immune cell population frequencies, specifically CD4+and C8+T activated cells, and their correlations with clinical parameters, such as disease activity scores. Lastly, we discussed emerging findings derived from different omic technologies which can provide integrated knowledge about SS pathogenesis and facilitate personalised medicine approaches leading to better patient outcomes in the future. © 2022 by the authors.",

Microcystins can be accumulated in various matrices in two forms: a free cellular fraction and a covalently protein-bound form. To detect and quantify the concentration of microcystins, a panel of techniques on various matrices (water, sediments, and animal tissues) is available. The analysis of MCs can concern the free or the total (free plus covalently bound) fractions. Free-form analyses of MCs are the most common and easiest to detect, whereas total-form analyses are much less frequent and more complex to achieve. The objective of this review is to summarize the different methods of extraction and analysis that have been developed for total forms. Four extraction methods were identified: MMPB (2-methyl-3-methoxy-4-phenylbutyric acid) method, deconjugation at basic pH, ozonolysis, and laser irradiation desorption. The study of the bibliography on the methods of extraction and analysis of the total forms of MCs showed that the reference method for the subject remains the MMPB method even if alternative methods and, in particular, deconjugation at basic pH, showed results encouraging the continuation of the methodological development on different matrices and on naturally-contaminated samples. © 2022 by the authors.","2 methyl 3 methoxy 4 phenylbutyric acid; 4 phenylbutyric acid; carboxen; chemical compound; cyanobacterium toxin; dimeticone; glutathione; mercaptoethanol; microcystin; permanganate potassium; trypsin; unclassified drug; microcystin; water; Ameiurus nebulosus; Coregonus clupeaformis; covalent bond; cyanobacterium; electron impact mass spectrometry; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; extracellular matrix; flame ionization detection; gas chromatography; high performance liquid chromatography; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liquid liquid extraction; Lymnaea stagnalis; mass fragmentography; mass spectrometry; Metacarcinus magister; Mugil cephalus; Mytilus edulis; nonhuman; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Osmerus mordax; ozonolysis; Perca flavescens; pH; Review; Salmo salar; Salvelinus fontinalis; size exclusion chromatography; solid phase extraction; solid phase microextraction; spectrofluorometry; tandem mass spectrometry; animal; water pollutant; Animals; Cyanobacteria; Cyanobacteria Toxins; Microcystins; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The search for sustainable and efficient wastewater treatment technologies has gained scientific interest recently; particular focus is on using biowaste to produce hydrochars (HCs) via the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) process used as adsorbent materials for dye, heavy metal, and emerging pollutant removal. HTC materials derived from renewable resources are an environmentally friendly and adequate way to adsorb pollutants such as organic and inorganic molecules from wastewaters. This review focuses on the advantages of the HTC process which lead to improved properties of the materials obtained, making them highly efficient in wastewater treatment. The information presented in this paper was derived from the most recent publications in the field.

This requires identifying the factors and understanding how they mechanistically influence COVID-19. Here, we describe how eleven selected factors (age, sex, genetic factors, lipid disorders, heart failure, gut dysbiosis, diet, vitamin D deficiency, air pollution and exposure to chemicals) influence COVID-19 by applying the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP), which is well-established in regulatory toxicology. This framework aims to model the sequence of events leading to an adverse health outcome. Several linear AOPs depicting pathways from the binding of the virus to ACE2 up to clinical outcomes observed in COVID-19 have been developed and integrated into a network offering a unique overview of the mechanisms underlying the disease. As SARS-CoV-2 infectibility and ACE2 activity are the major starting points and inflammatory response is central in the development of COVID-19, we evaluated how those eleven intrinsic and extrinsic factors modulate those processes impacting clinical outcomes. Applying this AOP-aligned approach enables the identification of current knowledge gaps orientating for further research and allows to propose biomarkers to identify of high-risk patients.

In stress periods, however, proteostasis and survival depend on the strongly conserved Clp/Hsp100 family. Currently, the targets of ATP-powered unfoldases/disaggregases ClpB and ClpX and of peptidase ClpP heptameric rings are still unclear. Trapping experiments and proteome profiling in multiple organisms triggered confusion, so we analyzed the consistency of ClpP-trap targets in bacteria. We also provide meta-analyses of protein interactions in humans, to elucidate where Clp family members are enriched. Furthermore, meta-analyses of mouse complexomics are provided. Genotype–phenotype correlations confirmed our concept. Trapping, proteome, and complexome data retrieved consistent coaccumulation of CLPXP with GFM1 and TUFM orthologs. CLPX shows broad interaction selectivity encompassing mitochondrial translation elongation, RNA granules, and nucleoids. CLPB preferentially attaches to mitochondrial RNA granules and translation initiation components; CLPP is enriched with them all and associates with release/recycling factors. Mutations in CLPP cause Perrault syndrome, with phenotypes similar to defects in mtDNA/mtRNA. Thus, we propose that CLPB and CLPXP are crucial to counteract misfolded insoluble protein assemblies that contain nucleotides. This insight is relevant to improve ClpP-modulating drugs that block bacterial growth and for the treatment of human infertility, deafness, and neurodegeneration. © 2022 by the authors.","acid lipase; acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; bacterial protein; chaperonin 60; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing) B; elongation factor G; elongation factor Ts; elongation factor Tu; elongation factor Tu mitochondrial protein; endopeptidase ClpX; FabG protein; FtsA protein; FtsZ protein; g elongation factor mitochondrial 1; GatB protein; glycine hydroxymethyltransferase; initiation factor; KatE protein; McsB protein; mitochondrial DNA; mitochondrial RNA; MurA protein; MurC protein; outer membrane protein A; protein ClpB; protein SecA; proteome; purine nucleoside phosphorylase; pyruvate dehydrogenase; RecA protein; Rho factor; ribosomal protein L1; RNA binding protein; succinate dehydrogenase; transcription factor GATA; transketolase; translation initiation factor b; unclassified drug; UvrA protein; adenosine triphosphatase; endopeptidase Clp; proteome; RNA binding protein; amino acid metabolism; Arabidopsis thaliana; Bacillus subtilis; bacterial growth; Caulobacter vibrioides; citric acid cycle; complexomics; down regulation; enzyme substrate; Escherichia coli; gene mutation; genetic disorder; genotype phenotype correlation; hearing impairment; human; IPOD (insoluble protein deposit); lipid metabolism; Mus musculus; nerve degeneration; nonhuman; omics; oxidative phosphorylation; perception deafness; perrault syndrome; Podospora anserina; protein degradation; protein expression; protein family; protein interaction; protein protein interaction; protein targeting; proteomics; Review; ribonucleoprotein granule; RNA processing; Staphylococcus aureus; telomeric repeat amplification protocol; translation elongation; translation initiation; animal; bacterium; chemistry; metabolism; mouse; Adenosine Triphosphatases; Animals; Bacteria; Endopeptidase Clp; Humans; Mice; Proteome; RNA-Binding Proteins"

Limited information is available about PFAS in wastewater, which is the focus of this review. PFAS wastewater sources include domestic effluents, industrial effluents, landfill leachates, stormwater, and agricultural effluents through their use in various applications. Land application of PFAS-contaminated wastewater can lead to the contamination of soil and groundwater, thereby reaching the food chain through plant uptake and consumption of potable water. Landfill leachates and industrial effluents contain the highest concentrations of PFAS, posing serious risks to surrounding waterways. Transformation of PFAS precursors can occur through abiotic and biotic processes within the treatment of wastewater, resulting in the formation of harmful PFAS compounds. Currently, there is limited data reported on novel short-chain and ultra-short chain PFAS and PFAS precursors. The strong thermal and chemical stability of PFAS and the complex nature of PFAS mixtures makes the remediation of PFAS in wastewater challenging.

An association of a reduction of vaccination efficacy with PFAS serum levels in humans was used by the European Food Safety Authority as a key effect for PFAS risk assessment. The data support for using this association is reviewed by a critical analysis of the respective human epidemiology and the available animal studies on the immunomodulation of PFAS. Based on an analysis of the available human epidemiology, the overall level of evidence regarding associations between PFAS serum levels and reduced antibody response remains weak. Absence of an association between an increase in clinical infections and PFAS serum levels and the limited understanding of the importance of antibody levels as an isolated data point further support this conclusion. Animal toxicity studies with PFAS focusing on immunomodulation also provide only limited support for immunomodulation as an important endpoint in PFAS toxicity. While immunomodulation is observed after PFAS administration, generally at blood concentrations several orders of magnitude above those seen in environmentally exposed humans, the relevance of these observation is hampered by the high doses required to influence immune endpoints, the limited number of endpoints assessed, and inconsistent results. The limitations of the current database on associations of human PFAS exposures outlined here indicate that more evidence is required to select immunomodulation as a critical endpoint for human PFAS risk assessment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","antibody response; blood level; controlled study; drug megadose; drug safety; environmental exposure; fluorination; food safety; human; human tissue; immunomodulation; review; risk assessment; vaccination; animal; chemistry; immunomodulation; pollutant; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Immunomodulation"

Increasing evidence has suggested that a number of miRNAs play important roles in modulating various aspects of synaptic plasticity. The deregulation of miRNAs could be associated with pathological alterations in synaptic plasticity, which could lead to different CNS-related diseases. Herein, we provide an update on the role of miRNAs in governing synaptic plasticity. In addition, we also summarize recent researches on the role of miRNAs in drug addiction, and their targets and mechanism of action.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging contaminants with the characteristics of persistence and bioaccumulation. PFAS exposure can affect the function of the nervous, endocrine, and immune system of animals and humans. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the epidemiological studies investigating potential relationships between PFAS exposure and vaccine antibody levels, and assessed whether PFAS would affect vaccine response in healthy children. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases up to February 2022. We chose studies that measured serum vaccines antibodies and PFAS concentrations of the participants. Essential information, including mean difference of percentage change, regression coefficient, odds ratio, Spearman correlation coefficient, and 95% confidence intervals, were extracted from the selected studies to conduct descriptive analysis and meta-analysis where appropriate. The qualities of these studies were evaluated as well. Finally, nine epidemiological studies about children met our inclusion criteria. A high degree of heterogeneity is observed in terms of breastfeeding time, confounder control, and detection method. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level in children without heterogeneity by Cochran's Q test (p = 0.26; p = 0.55), and exposure to perfluorohexane sulfonate is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level but with heterogeneity (p = 0.04). This comprehensive review suggests that PFAS can have adverse health effects on children by hindering the production of vaccine antibodies. There are some consistent and negative associations between children exposure to certain PFAS and tetanus antibody level. The association of the other four vaccines (measles, rubella, mumps, and influenza) with PFAS remains uncertain, because very few studies are available. Further studies are needed to validate the possible associations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biochemistry; Quality control; Vaccines; Emerging contaminant; Environmental exposure; Epidemiological studies; Literature search; Meta-analysis; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Systematic Review; Vaccine antibody; Web of Science; Antibodies; antibody; diphtheria vaccine; influenza vaccine; measles vaccine; mumps vaccine; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; rubella vaccine; tetanus antibody; tetanus toxoid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; virus antibody; antibody; bioaccumulation; chemical pollutant; disease control; endocrine system; epidemiology; immune system; literature review; meta-analysis; model validation; pollution effect; vaccination; vaccine; antibody blood level; antibody production; bioaccumulation; breast feeding; confounding variable; correlation coefficient; drug response; environmental exposure; Haemophilus influenzae type b; human; influenza; measles; mumps; Review; rubella; systematic review; treatment outcome; epidemiology; meta analysis; pollutant; tetanus; toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Antibodies, Viral; Environmental Pollutants; Epidemiologic Studies; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Tetanus"

SPME sampling disturbs systems to a minimum—it removes (extracts) only small fractions of analytes. Therefore, in vivo analysis is a special application area where SPME is gaining ground. This review summarizes state-of-the-art in vivo SPME for bioanalysis (in human, rats, fishes, rhesus macaque, frog, and living cattle), including biocompatible SPME coatings, sampling approaches for in vivo SPME (skin, exhaled breath, saliva, blood, muscle, and brain sampling), analytical/detection systems, and calibration methods. This review also discusses in vivo SPME applications (pharmacokinetic studies, exposure, biomarkers, diagnosis, doping control, lipidomics, drug analysis, cosmetic dermatology, bioaccumulation, biomonitoring, environmental pollutants, and therapeutic drug monitoring) and future trends in in vivo SPME bioanalysis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Biochemistry; Biocompatibility; Drug products; Extraction; Muscle; Patient monitoring; Analytes; Bioanalysis; Biocompatible solid phase microextraction fiber; In vivo solid phase microextraction; In vivo solid phase microextraction – AMS; In-vivo; Solid-phase microextraction; Solid-phase microextraction fibers; Liquid chromatography; 2 methylisoborneol; acetone; acrolein; alcohol; anesthetic agent; atrazine; carbamazepine; crystal violet; diazepam; doxorubicin; endocannabinoid; fenoterol; fluoxetine; geosmin; hesperetin; ibuprofen; icosanoid; isoprene; luteolin; malachite green; methadone; neurotransmitter; nordazepam; oxazepam; oxylipin; perfluoro compound; polycyclic aromatic compound; quinolone derivative; steroid; tetrodotoxin; toxic substance; volatile organic compound; analytic method; bioaccumulation; biological monitoring; blood sampling; brain analysis; calibration; coating (procedure); cosmetic dermatology; doping; drug analysis; drug monitoring; exposure; human; in vivo study; lipidomics; metabolomics; nonhuman; pharmacokinetics; pollutant; Review; saliva analysis; sampling; skin examination; solid phase microextraction"

Of the thousands of PFAS used by consumers and industry, very few have been thoroughly characterized for potential adverse effects. This is especially true for the novel short-chain (C < 8) alternatives that replaced legacy PFAS. Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances have revealed inconsistencies in the toxicokinetics predicted by animal models and empirical findings in humans. To adequately assess the possible health effects of short-chain PFAS, there is a need for robust aggregated data sets on the mechanistic underpinnings and physiochemical properties of these alternatives. Acquiring relevant data on the health effects of short-chain PFAS can be achieved through high-throughput methods supported by in vitro human cell-based models.

According to the arrangement of the fluorene unit and its chemical location on the chain, polyfluorene family was expressed in three classes; fluorene EC homopolymers, copolymers and functional EC polymers. With its sometimes surprising properties and countless advantages, fluorene monomer has many contributions to the electrochromic conductive polymer chain. Although there are many fluorene derived polymers in the literature that have been functionalized and/or used in various applications, this review only found it appropriate to focus on conductive electrochromic polymers with possessing fluorene chemical units. For this purpose, it has been tried to review and comment on fluorene polymers by comparing their chemical, electrochemical and optical properties in a logical framework. One of the biggest problems of electrochromic conductive polymer researchers is to analyze how the redox and electrochromic properties of polymers, which consist of a functional group, change according to the position on the conjugated polymer chain. For this reason, it is thought that the contribution and guideness of this study to the literature will be considerable. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Electrochromic devices; Electrochromism; Electropolymerization; Chemical polymerization; Conductive Polymer; Electrochromic polymers; Electrochromics; Fluorenes; Functional conjugated polymer; Polyfluorene copolymer; Polyfluorene homopolymer; Polyfluorenes; Polymer chains; Conjugated polymers"

Besides, deoxygenation of heterocyclic N-oxides has also emerged as a reaction of significance in organic chemistry. In the past decade, visible light photoredox catalyzed C-2 functionalization and deoxygenation of these heterocyclic N-oxides have drawn substantial attention owing to their mild reaction conditions. This review has been categorized based on visible-light-mediated nondeoxygenative C-2 functionalization (alkylation, fluoroalkylation, arylation, acylation, and amination), deoxygenative C-2 functionalization (sulfonylation, alkynylation, alkylation, and acylation), and deoxygenation (without C−H functionalization) of heterocyclic N-oxides.

There is a growing interest in the use of ketogenic supplements, including medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), to achieve intermittent ketosis without adhering to a strict ketogenic diet. MCT supplementation is an inexpensive and simple ketogenic intervention, proven to benefit both individuals with normal cognition and those suffering from mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and other cognitive disorders. The commonly accepted paradigm underlying MCT supplementation trials is that the benefits stem from ketogenesis and that MCT supplementation is safe. However, medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) may also exert effects in the brain directly. Moreover, MCFAs, long-chain fatty acids, and glucose participate in mutually intertwined metabolic pathways. Therefore, the metabolic effects must be considered if the desired procognitive effects require administering MCT in doses larger than 1 g/kg. This review summarizes currently available research on the procognitive effects of using MCTs as a supplement to regular feed/diet without concomitant reduction of carbohydrate intake and focuses on the revealed mechanisms linked to particular MCT metabolites (ketone bodies, MCFAs), highlighting open questions and potential considerations.

The evaluation shows the need to use environmentally-relevant media to properly quantify the effectiveness/efficiency of EO for PFASs treatment. Additionally, there is currently a lack of quantification of sorption losses, resulting in a likely over-estimation of process’ efficiencies. Furthermore, the majority of experimental results to date indicate that short-chain PFASs are the most challenging and need to be prioritized as environmental regulations become more stringent.

Despite the many efforts made to understand the mechanisms of TA-TMA, its pathogenesis is largely unknown, its diagnosis is challenging and the case-fatality rate remains high. The hallmarks of TA-TMA, as for any TMA, are platelet consumption, hemolysis, and organ dysfunction, particularly the kidney, leading also to hypertension. However, coexisting complications, such as infections and/or immune-mediated injury and/or drug toxicity, together with the heterogeneity of diagnostic criteria, render the diagnosis difficult. During the last 10 years, evidence has been provided on the involvement of the complement system in the pathophysiology of TA-TMA, supported by functional, genetic, and therapeutic data. Complement dysregulation is believed to collaborate with other proinflammatory and procoagulant factors to cause endothelial injury and consequent microvascular thrombosis and tissue damage. However, data on complement activation in TA-TMA are not sufficient to support a systematic use of complement inhibition therapy in all patients. Thus, it seems reasonable to propose complement inhibition therapy only to those patients exhibiting a clear complement activation according to the available biomarkers. Several agents are now available to inhibit complement activity: two drugs have been successfully used in TA-TMA, particularly in pediatric cases (eculizumab and narsoplimab) and others are at different stages of development (ravulizumab, coversin, pegcetacoplan, crovalimab, avacopan, iptacopan, danicopan, BCX9930, and AMY-101). © 2022 by the authors.","avacopan; bcx 9930; complement component C1; complement component C1q; complement component C3a; complement component C3b receptor; complement component C5a; complement component C5b; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement membrane attack complex; crovalimab; daclizumab; danicopan; decay accelerating factor; defibrotide; dextro tyrosylisoleucylcysteinylvalyl 1 methyltryptophylglutaminylaspartyltryptophyl n methylglycylalanylhistidylarginylcysteinyl n methylisoleucinamide 3,13 cyclic sulfide; eculizumab; immunosuppressive agent; iptacopan; mannan binding lectin associated serine proteinase; membrane cofactor protein; narsoplimab; nomacopan; pegcetacoplan; ravulizumab; rituximab; unclassified drug; von Willebrand factor cleaving proteinase; complement activation; complement inhibition; complement system; drug mechanism; endothelium injury; gene deletion; gene identification; genetic predisposition; graft versus host reaction; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; hemolytic uremic syndrome; high throughput sequencing; human; medical history; microvascular thrombosis; mismatched unrelated donor; myeloablative conditioning; nonhuman; pathogenesis; pathophysiology; Review; risk factor; sex difference; thrombotic microangiopathy"

Slaughterhouse wastewater (SWW) contains proteins, fats, high organic contents, microbes, and other emerging pollutants (pharmaceutical and veterinary residues). It is important to first characterize the wastewater so that adequate treatment techniques can be employed so that discharge of this wastewater does not negatively impact the environment. Conventional characterization bulk parameters of slaughterhouse wastewater include pH, color, turbidity, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and coliform counts. Characterization studies conducted have revealed the effects of the pollutants on microbial activity of SWW through identification of toxicity of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Due to the high-strength characteristics and complex recalcitrant pollutants, treatment techniques through combined processes such as anaerobic digestion coupled with advanced oxidation process were found to be more effective than stand-alone methods. Hence, there is need to explore and evaluate innovative treatments and techniques to provide a comprehensive summary of processes that can reduce the toxicity of slaughterhouse wastewater to the environment.

Emerging findings suggest that non-communicable diseases are linked to early and chronic environmental exposures. However, the rapid globalisation in developing countries, environmental change and the emergence, spread, persistence and severity of infectious diseases are not yet well understood. The aim of this study is to understand which environmental toxicants are commonly associated with infectious diseases in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods and analysis A total of four electronic databases, MEDLINE through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) be searched to identify relevant studies and will be screened by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool for randomised control trials (RCTs) and ROB assessment tool for non-randomised studies for non-RCTs will be used to assess the ROB. A meta-analysis will be used to determine the pooled effect if we find out the included articles have similar environmental exposure, participant groups, study design and outcome measures. A narrative synthesis of the findings will be provided, along with summaries of the intervention effect. Heterogeneity between the studies will be assessed, and sensitivity analysis will be conducted based on study quality. Ethics and dissemination Findings will be summarised in a single manuscript. This review attempts to explore the pivotal role of environmental toxicants in predisposing, developing, persistent and severity of infectious diseases in LMICs. Findings from this study will highlight the effects of individual environmental toxicants' role on infectious disease outcomes for the early prevention and limit toxic exposure to guide individual, community, and occupational health policy for future strategies.

While current Smart Cities are often inaccessible, the experience of everyday citizens may be enhanced with a combination of the emerging technologies Digital Twins (DTs) and Situated Analytics. DTs represent their Physical Twin (PT) in the real world via models, simula-tions, (remotely) sensed data, context awareness, and interactions. However, interaction requires appropriate interfaces to address the complexity of the city. Ultimately, leveraging the potential of Smart Cities requires going beyond assembling the DT to be comprehensive and accessible. Situated Analytics allows for the anchoring of city information in its spatial context. We advance the concept of embedding the DT into the PT through Situated Analytics to form Fused Twins (FTs). This fusion allows access to data in the location that it is generated in in an embodied context that can make the data more understandable. Prototypes of FTs are rapidly emerging from different domains, but Smart Cities represent the context with the most potential for FTs in the future. This paper reviews DTs, Situated Analytics, and Smart Cities as the foundations of FTs. Regarding DTs, we define five components (physical, data, analytical, virtual, and Connection Environments) that we relate to several cognates (i.e., similar but different terms) from existing literature. Regarding Situated Analytics, we review the effects of user embodiment on cognition and cognitive load. Finally, we classify existing partial examples of FTs from the literature and address their construction from Augmented Reality, Geographic Information Systems, Building/City Information Models, and DTs and provide an overview of future directions. © 2022 by the authors.

The plight of African vultures exemplifies these challenges due to environmental contaminants and other stressors acting on individuals and populations that are already threatened or endangered. Many of these threats emanate from increasing human population size and settlement density, habitat loss from changing land use for agriculture, residential areas, and industry, and climate-related changes in resource availability. Environmental chemicals that are hazardous include legacy chemicals, emerging chemicals of concern, and high-volume-use chemicals that are employed as weed killers and in other agricultural applications. Furthermore, there are differences in risk for species living in close proximity to humans or in areas affected by habitat loss, climate, and industry. Monitoring programs are essential to track the status of nesting pairs, offspring survival, longevity, and lifetime productivity. This is important for long-lived birds, such as vultures, that may be especially vulnerable to chronic exposure to chemicals as obligate scavengers. Furthermore, their position in the food web may increase risk due to biomagnification of chemicals. We review the primary chemical hazards to Old World vultures and the interacting stressors affecting these and other birds. Habitat is a major consideration for vultures, with tree-nesters and cliff-nesters potentially experiencing different risks of exposure to environmental chemicals. The present review provides information from long-term monitoring programs and discusses a range of these threats and their effects on vulture populations.

With the phase-out of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanate (PFOA) due to their risk to the ecosystem and human population, various novel PFASs have been used as replacements and detected in groundwater. In order to summarize the current understanding and knowledge gaps on PFASs in groundwater, we reviewed the studies about environmental occurrence, transport, and risk of legacy and novel PFASs in groundwater published from 1999 to 2021. Our review suggests that PFOS and PFOA could still be detected in groundwater due to the long residence time and the retention in the soil-groundwater system. Firefighting training sites, industrial parks, and landfills were commonly hotspots of PFASs in groundwater. More novel PFASs have been detected via nontarget analysis using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Some novel PFASs had concentrations comparable to that of PFOS and PFOA. Both legacy and novel PFASs can pose a risk to human population who rely on contaminated groundwater as drinking water. Transport of PFASs to groundwater is influenced by various factors, i.e., the compound structure, the hydrochemical condition, and terrain. The exchange of PFASs between groundwater and surface water needs to be better characterized. Field monitoring, isotope tracing, nontarget screening, and modeling are useful approaches and should be integrated to get a comprehensive understanding of PFASs sources and behaviors in groundwater. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","chemical substance; detection method; drinking water; groundwater pollution; groundwater-surface water interaction; pollutant transport; residence time; water exchange; alkanesulfonic acid; drinking water; fluorocarbon; ground water; chemistry; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; human; procedures; water pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Drinking Water; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Groundwater; Humans; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Fluctuating energy supplies demand a load-flexible energy system and a dynamically operating FTS reactor might be beneficial compared to traditional steady-state operations which rely on expensive upstream buffer capacities. This review provides an overview of recent experimental and simulation studies dealing with dynamic FTS operation and summarizes the main findings. The results are presented the two categories, process intensification and PtX application. The review further discusses the experimentally difficult task of wide-ranging product characterization with a high temporal resolution. While dynamic reactor operation is often related to a complicated process control, which challenges a save and efficient reactor performance, the literature findings indicate that for dynamic FTS operation such concerns might not be as critical as assumed, at least within well-known boundaries. Researchers further agree that dynamic operation might be a tool for process intensification. Especially hydrogen pulsing seems to be a potentially beneficial operating technique to remove accumulated liquid products, restore initial catalyst activity and increase diesel-range productivity. The main challenge in this context is the prevention of high methane selectivity. A lucid future engineering goal seems to be the combination of the two applications: a robust and reliable FTS reactor in a PtX scenario that not only handles a fluctuating feed but uses such variations for process enhancement. © 2022 The Authors","Catalyst activity; Fuel storage; Dynamic operations; Excess energy; Fischer-Tropsch reactors; Fluctuation; Fossil resources; Power; Power-to-X; Process intensification; Product analysis; Synthesis reactors; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis"

PFAS exposure in people can have detrimental health consequences. Therefore, reducing PFAS burdens in food items is of great importance to public health. Here, we investigated whether cooking reduces PFAS concentrations in animal-derived food products by synthesizing experimental studies. Further, we examined the moderating effects of the following five variables: cooking time, liquid/animal tissue ratio, cooking temperature, carbon chain length of PFAS and the cooking category (oil-based, water-based &amp; no-liquid cooking). In our systematic review searches, we obtained 512 effect sizes (relative differences in PFAS concentration between raw and cooked samples) from 10 relevant studies. These studies exclusively explored changes in PFAS concentrations in cooked seafood and freshwater fish. Our multilevel-meta-analysis has revealed that, on average, cooking reduced PFAS concentrations by 29%, although heterogeneity among effect sizes was very high (I2 = 94.65%). Our five moderators cumulatively explained 49% of the observed heterogeneity. Specifically, an increase in cooking time and liquid/animal tissue ratio, as well as shorter carbon chain length of PFAS (when cooked with oil) were associated with significant reductions in PFAS concentrations. The effects of different ways of cooking depended on the other moderators, while the effect of cooking temperature itself was not significant. Overall, cooking can reduce PFAS concentrations in blue food (seafood and freshwater fish). However, it is important to note that complete PFAS elimination requires unrealistically long cooking times and large liquid/animal tissue ratios. Currently, literature on the impact of cooking of terrestrial animal produce on PFAS concentrations is lacking, which limits the inference and generalisation of our meta-analysis. However, our work represents the first step towards developing guidelines to reduce PFAS in food via cooking exclusively with common kitchen items and techniques. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon; Fish; Liquids; Meats; Moderators; Oils and fats; Tissue; Water; Cooking time; Data synthesis; Human exposures; Meta-analysis; Meta-regression; PFOA; PFOS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; POP; Substance concentrations; Cooking; carbon; chemical compound; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; water; alkanesulfonic acid; carbon; fluorocarbon; concentration (composition); food quality; literature review; meta-analysis; organofluorine; persistent organic pollutant; seafood; concentration (parameter); cooking; data synthesis; effect size; food analysis; food contamination; food intake; freshwater fish; human; nonhuman; practice guideline; raw food; Review; sea food; systematic review; temperature sensitivity; animal; cooking; fish; meta analysis; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Carbon; Cooking; Fishes; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Seafood"

Methods: Searches were carried out in five electronic databases, with terms related to PFOA, including muscle strength, volume and activation. Only studies with at least one group with symptomatic PFOA and one asymptomatic group were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology. Using the random effects model, a meta-analysis was performed when there were at least two studies reporting the same domain. Results: Eight studies (250 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Subjects with PFOA had weaker hip abduction (SMD -0.96; 95%CI = −1.34 to −0.57), hip external rotation (−0.55;-1.07 to −0.03), hip extension (−0.72;-1.16 to −0.28), and knee extension (−0.97;-1.41 to −0.53) when compared to asymptomatic controls.

Acidimicrobium sp. degraded perfluoroalkyl acids anaerobically in the presence of electron donors. A mixed Pseudomonas culture was more effective than pure cultures. Multiple plants were found to bioconcentrate perfluorochemicals and many demonstrated the ability to hyperaccumulate perfluoroalkyl acids, particularly Festuca rubra, Salix nigra and Betula nigra. Fungal species, particularly Pseudeurotium sp. and Geomyces sp., have the potential to degrade perfluorooctanoic acid or perfluorooctane sulphonic acid. Perfluorochemicals bioremediation could be advanced with identification of more candidate species for bioremediation, optimization of bioremediation conditions, mixed culturing, experiments with environmental media and studies on the biochemical pathways of biotransformation.

The activation atmosphere, drying, calcination, reduction conditions and type of support are critical factors that govern the reducibility, dispersion and crystallite size of the active phase. Compared to traditional high temperature H2 activation, both hydrogenation-carbidisation-hydrogenation and reduction-oxidation-reduction pretreatment cycles result in improved metal dispersion and exhibit much higher FTS activity. Cobalt carbide (Co2C) formed by CO treatment has the potential to provide a simpler and more effective way of producing lower olefins, and higher alcohols directly from syngas.

Also, these support surface properties may influence the mass transfer of reactants and products at the catalyst active sites and subsequently affects the performance of the catalyst during FTS. Pre-silylated and post-silylated catalysts have been used to study the influence of surface hydrophobicity on the performance of FTS catalysts. The enhancement of FTS activity by hydrophobicity was mainly ascribed to the improved reducibility of metal oxide species.

One neuropeptide Y/F-like peptide, named TpNPY, was identified and selected for in silico structural, in silico binding, and pharmacological studies. In our study, the anti-inflammation effect of TpNPY was evaluated using an LPS-stimulated C8-D1A astrocyte cell model. Our results demonstrated that TpNPY, at 0.75-3 μM, inhibited LPS-induced NO production and reduced the expression of iNOS in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, TpNPY reduced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, treatment with TpNPY reduced LPS-mediated elevation of ROS production and the intracellular calcium concentration. Further investigation revealed that TpNPY downregulated the IKK/IκB/NF-κB signaling pathway and inhibited expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Through molecular docking and using an NPY receptor antagonist, TpNPY was shown to have the ability to interact with the NPY Y1 receptor.

Visible-light-mediated photoredox catalysis also offers exciting opportunities to achieve challenging carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond formations with excellent chemo-, regio-, or stereoselectivity under mild and ecologically benign conditions. The greater part of photoredox reactions depends on heavy metals like ruthenium(ii) or iridium(iii) based complexes as photoredox catalysts owing to their strong absorption, long-lived excited-state lifetimes and high oxidation or redox potentials. However, these transition metal complexes are expensive and pose severe drawbacks with respect to large scale application and sustainability. Organic dyes are also commonly used as a low-cost alternative to Ru- or Ir-based complexes. However, they have inferior photostability. Thus, further development of alternative photocatalysts based on copper salts or copper complexes is widely investigated because of their economic and environmental benefits. In recent years, visible-light-mediated direct functionalization of olefins or alkynes to afford a diverse range of organic compounds has received extensive interest from synthetic chemists due to their easy availability and reactivity towards a large number of reactants.

Mathematical modelling can be a useful tool as a comprehensive approach to study their fate and transport in natural waters. However, modelling studies of the occurrence, fate and transport of ECs in aquatic environments have generally received far less attention than the more widespread field and laboratory studies. In this study, we reviewed the current status of modelling ECs based on selected representative ECs, including their sources, fate and various mechanisms as well as their interactions with the surrounding environments in aquatic ecosystems, and explore future development and perspectives in this area. Most importantly, the principles, mathematical derivations, ongoing development and applications of various ECs models in different geographical regions are critically reviewed and discussed. The recommendations for improving data quality, monitoring planning, model development and applications were also suggested. The outcomes of this review can lay down a future framework in developing a comprehensive ECs modelling approach to help researchers and policymakers effectively manage water resources impacted by rising levels of ECs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Endocrine disrupters; Geographical regions; Information management; Water pollution; Water resources; Aquatic environments; Current status; Development and applications; Emerging contaminant; Fate and transport; Future perspectives; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Pharmaceutical and personal care products; Transport and fate; Waters resources; Aquatic ecosystems; aquatic environment; environmental fate; environmental monitoring; future prospect; numerical model; pollutant source; pollutant transport; water resource; aquatic environment; data quality; human; review; water availability; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; water pollutant; cosmetic; drug; endocrine disruptor; Cosmetics; Ecosystem; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Despite their abundance in AFFF, information is lacking on the potential transformation of these polyfluoroalkyl substances. Due to the biological and chemical stability of the repeating perfluoroalkyl -(CF2)n- moiety common to all known AFFF-derived PFASs, it is not immediately evident whether the microbial biotransformation mechanisms observed for other organic contaminants also govern the microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances. Herein, we aim to: 1) review the literature on the aerobic or anaerobic microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances in environmental media; 2) compile and summarize proposed microbial biotransformation pathways for major classes of polyfluoroalkyl substances; 3) identify the dominant biotransformation intermediates and terminal biotransformation products; and 4) discuss these findings in the context of environmental monitoring and source allocation. This analysis revealed that much more is currently known about aerobic microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances, as compared to anaerobic biotransformation. Further, there are some similarities in microbial biotransformations of fluorotelomer and electrochemical fluorination-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, but differences may be largely due to head group composition. Dealkylation, oxidation, and hydrolytic reactions appear to be particularly important for microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, and these biotransformations may lead to formation of some semi-stable intermediates.

This research examines innovative AOPs for the treatment of MEA in the aqueous phase in depth. This paper gives a systematic assessment of MEA degradation mechanisms and pathways, as well as a complete examination of process parameters that influence degradation rate, such as pH, temperature, and MEA doses. Ozonation, UV, Fenton, and Plasma treatments, as well as hybrid processes such as per-oxone processes, catalytic ozonation, UV/Ozonation, UV/catalysis, UV/chlorination, and photo-Fenton processes, have all recently been reported as AOPs for MEA degradation.

However, the widespread use of sunscreens and other personal care products containing these filters has led to these compounds being widely detected in the environment and being identified as emerging pollutants in marine waters. Concerns raised by laboratory studies investigating the potential impact of UV filters on coral communities have already led to bans on the use of some sunscreens in a few tourist hotspots. Although UV filter pollution may be just one of the many environmental factors impacting coral health worldwide, the media attention surrounding these studies and the legislative changes may lead patients to question dermatologists about the environmental safety of some sunscreen products. This review provides an overview of current knowledge on the impact of UV filters on marine ecosystems, concentrating on recent studies examining the effects of commonly used filters on organisms at low trophic levels and of how alternative approaches, such as metabolomics, can be used to further assess UV filter ecotoxicity. Current gaps in our knowledge are also discussed, most notably the need to increase our understanding of the longer-term fate and behaviour of UV filters in the marine environment, develop more adapted standardized ecotoxicity tests for a wider range of marine species, and evaluate the impact of UV filters on the marine food web. We then discuss future perspectives for the development of new, more environmentally friendly, filters that may enable the use of the most toxic compounds to be reduced without compromising the effectiveness of sunscreen formulations. Finally, we consider how dermatologists play a key role in educating patients on the need for a balanced approach to sun exposure, sun protection, and conservation of the marine environment. © 2022 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.","coral reef; ecotoxicity; fish; food web; marine environment; metabolomics; nonhuman; photodegradation; Review; sediment"

However, associations between exposure to PFASs and the risk of breast cancer are controversial. We retrieved studies on the association between PFASs—perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluo-rononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)—and breast cancer risk in women from PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were ex-tracted or calculated from provided data. Moreover, subgroup and metaregression analyses were performed to distinguish the potential sources of heterogeneity between studies. Lastly, eight orig-inal studies were included in the meta-analysis. PFOA and PFHxS were positively correlated with breast cancer risk, and the pooled ORs (and 95% CIs) were 1.32 (1.19 and 1.46) and 1.79 (1.51 and 2.11), respectively. PFNA was negatively correlated with breast cancer risk and the pooled OR (and 95% CIs) was 0.76 (0.6 and 0.96), and PFOS was shown to have no correlation with breast cancer risk and the pooled OR (and 95% CIs) was 1.01 (0.87 and 1.17). All results were merged in a random-effects model with significant heterogeneities (I2 &gt; 90%, p &lt; 0.001).

Human occupational and community exposure to PFAS has been associated with several cancers, including cancers of the kidney, testis, prostate, and liver. While evidence suggests that PFAS are not directly mutagenic, many diverse mechanisms of carcinogenicity have been proposed. In this mini-review, we organize these mechanisms into three major proposed pathways of PFAS action—metabolism, endocrine disruption, and epigenetic perturbation—and discuss how these distinct but interdependent pathways may explain many of the proposed pro-carcinogenic effects of the PFAS class of environmental contaminants. Notably, each of the pathways is predicted to be highly sensitive to the dose and window of exposure which may, in part, explain the variable epidemiologic and experimental evidence linking PFAS and cancer.

PFAS compounds are resistant to degradation and are mobile in soil compared to other common contaminants. Many compounds have KD values (matrix/solution concentration quotients) of &lt;10. PFAS compounds endanger the health of humans and ecosystems by leaching into groundwater, exposure via dust, and, to a lesser extent, through plant uptake. This review aims to determine the feasibility of phytomanagement, the use of plants, and the use of soil conditioners to minimize environmental risk whilst also providing an economic return in the management of PFAS-contaminated land. For most sites, PFAS combina-tions render phytoextraction, the use of plants to remove PFAS from soil, inviable. In contrast, low Bioaccumulation Coefficients (BAC; plant and soil concentration quotients) timber species or native vegetation may be usefully employed for phytomanagement to limit human/food chain exposure to PFAS. Even with a low BAC, PFAS uptake by crop plants may still exceed food safety standards, and therefore, edible crop plants should be avoided. Despite this limitation, phytomanagement may be the only economically viable option to manage most of this land. Plant species and soil amendments should be chosen with the goal of reducing water flux through the soil, as well as increasing the hydrophobic components in soil that may bind the C-F-dominated tails of PFAS compounds. Soil conditioners such as biochar, with significant hydrophobic components, may mitigate the leaching of PFAS into receiving waters. Future work should focus on the interactions of PFAS with soil microbiota; secondary metabolites such as glomalin may immobilize PFAS in soil. © 2022 by the authors.

It has recently been recognized that advanced oxidation–reduction technologies (AO/RTs) exhibit superior removal performance for these ubiquitous pollutants. However, the detailed mechanisms and product risks have not been well summarized and systematically deciphered. In this mini-review article, the basic operating principles of two typical AO/RTs (electron beam and plasma irradiation) and their reported applications in the abatement of PFASs are described in detail. It is noteworthy that these reductive treatments induced remarkable defluorination efficiency of PFOA and PFOS with the generation of short-chain congeners in water. The reaction mechanisms mainly included desulfonization, decarboxylation, H/F exchange, radical cyclization, and stepwise losses of CF2 groups. Unexpectedly, partial degradation products manifested high potential in triggering acute and chronic aquatic toxicity, genotoxicity, and developmental toxicity. Additionally, high or even increased resistance to biodegradability was observed for multiple products relative to the parent chemicals. Taken together, both electron beam and plasma irradiation hold great promise in remediating PFAS-contaminated water and wastewater, while the secondary ecological risks should be taken into account during practical applications. © 2022 by the authors.

These maps can provide an overview of available studies and relevant study information to be used for various research objectives and applications. Environmental epidemiological studies that examine the impact of chemical exposures on various ‘omic profiles in human populations provide relevant mechanistic information and can be used for benchmark dose modeling to derive potential human health reference values. Objectives: To create a systematic evidence map of environmental epidemiological studies examining environmental contaminant exposures with ‘omics in order to characterize the extent of available studies for future research needs. Methods: Systematic review methods were used to search and screen the literature and included the use of machine learning methods to facilitate screening studies. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were developed to identify and screen relevant studies. Studies that met the PECO criteria after full-text review were summarized with information such as study population, study design, sample size, exposure measurement, and ‘omics analysis. Results: Over 10,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes were used to identify 84 studies considered PECO-relevant after full-text review. Various contaminants (e.g. phthalate, benzene, arsenic, etc.) were investigated in epidemiological studies that used one or more of the four ‘omics of interest: epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The epidemiological study designs that were used to explore single or integrated ‘omic research questions with contaminant exposures were cohort studies, controlled trials, cross-sectional, and case-control studies. An interactive web-based systematic evidence map was created to display more study-related information. Conclusions: This systematic evidence map is a novel tool to visually characterize the available environmental epidemiological studies investigating contaminants and biological effects using ‘omics technology and serves as a resource for investigators and allows for a range of applications in chemical research and risk assessment needs. © 2022","Contamination; Environmental technology; Learning systems; Risk assessment; 'omics'; Chemical exposure; Chemical risk assessment; Contaminant exposure; Environmental epidemiology; Epidemiological studies; Population exposure; Study design; Systematic evidence map; ‘omic; Molecular biology; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; metal; perfluoro compound; pesticide; phthalic acid derivative; volatile organic compound; epidemiology; map; public health; risk assessment; air pollutant; data base; environmental exposure; environmental impact; epidemiology; epigenetics; health risk assessment; human; metabolomics; persistent organic pollutant; proteomics; Review; scientific literature; systematic review; toxicokinetics; transcriptomics; adverse event; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; reference value; risk assessment; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Exposure; Epidemiologic Studies; Humans; Reference Values; Risk Assessment"

This increase is mainly due to various environmental factors including: radiation, smoking, obesity, pollutants such as pesticides, phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluorinated compounds, bromine flame retardants, perchlorates, nitrates and various elements such as metals, non-metals and metalloids. In particular, some metals such as iron, copper, cadmium, lead, vanadium, chromium, manganese and nickel have a positive effect, while others such as zinc and magnesium have a negative correlation with thyroid cancer. Other metals such as molybdenum, tin and cobalt appear to increase the incidence of thyroid cancer in combination, while sodium, mercury, aluminum and silver have no evidence of thyroid carcinogenicity. Of the non-metals, iodine and selenium deficiency are associated with carcinogenic effects on the thyroid, while there is no information on any phosphorus-relative activity. Boron belonging to the metalloids is considered a goitrogenic element and probably increases the incidence of thyroid cancer when it acts in combination with cadmium, molybdenum, taken in small non-toxic doses, for a long time. Finally, air pollution has been studied. It has been found that originating from gaseous waste is associated with an increased incidence of cancer in various anatomical areas, including the thyroid. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society of Environmental Risk Assessment and Health Science.","aluminum; arsenic; boron; bromine; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; flame retardant; iodine; iron; lead; magnesium; manganese; mercury; metalloid; molybdenum; nickel; nitric acid derivative; perchlorate; perfluoro compound; pesticide; phthalic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; selenium; silver; sodium; tin; vanadium; xenobiotic agent; zinc; air pollution; cancer mortality; carcinogenicity; endocrine system; environmental factor; gas waste; human; incidence; ionizing radiation; obesity; pollutant; radiation; Review; smoking; thyroid cancer"

Commendable research has been conducted to better understand the role of PFAS and the extent of its environmental and public health effects. However, most of these studies have focused on PFAS contamination in surface water and groundwater sources. This paper provides an overview of PFAS contamination in various environmental media with an in-depth analysis of atmospheric contamination and the modeling of fate and transport of PFAS in air. The mechanism and modeling of atmospheric PFAS are presented as well as their suitability, limitations, and areas necessitating additional research. The fate and transport models reviewed in this paper are incorporated for dry deposition, wet deposition, or combined dry and wet deposition. Each study concluded that deposition is a substantial removal mechanism of atmospheric PFAS, and further research must be conducted to assess the particle size distributions of PFAS as well as to account for the degradation of PFAS in the atmosphere prior to deposition. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Atmospheric movements; Deposition; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Public health; Surface waters; Atmospheric contamination; Background information; Environmental medium; Fate and transport; Groundwater sources; Health effects; In-depth analysis; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Surface water and groundwaters; Surface water sources; Contamination; chemical substance; dry deposition; environmental fate; particle size; pollutant transport; wet deposition"

These agents include air, gas (sulfur hexafluoride [SF6], hexafluoroethane [C2F6], and perfluoropropane [C3F8]), and silicone oil. The optimal tamponade agent is uncertain, and we aimed to review the effect of tamponade choice on hole closure and visual outcomes. Clinical relevance: Although most surgeons initially chose to use long-acting gas (C3F8), there has been a gradual change in practice to the increasing use of the medium- (C2F6) and short-acting gases (SF6) or even air. However, there is no consensus regarding their relative efficacies. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective and retrospective comparative cohort studies comparing different tamponade agents in patients undergoing vitrectomy and ILM peeling for primary idiopathic macular holes. For RCTs, the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs, whereas for nonrandomized studies, the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool was used. Results: Thirteen publications, including 2 RCTs, were identified. Overall, there was no significant difference in the anatomic closure rates between studies using SF6 compared with either C3F8 or C2F6 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51–1.08). A subgroup analysis showed a significantly higher closure rate using SF6 (OR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.30–0.79) in patients without postoperative posturing but not in those who were advised to posture facedown. The visual outcomes and adverse events were not significantly different. The comparisons of anatomic closure rates of patients treated with gas tamponade vs. silicone oil and with air vs. SF6 showed no significant differences. The included studies had a number of methodological limitations and heterogeneities, making conclusions imprecise, with low or very low certainty by the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between PFAS exposure and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the results are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFAS and MetS. We performed a systematic search strategy using three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies concerning the associations of PFAS with MetS and its clinical relevance from inception until January 2021. We undertook meta-analyses where there were five or more studies with exposure and outcomes assessments that were reasonably comparable. The pooled odd ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects models and heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 index and Q test. A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (10 studies on the general population and two studies in the occupational settings) investigated the association between PFAS exposure and MetS. We pooled data from seven studies on the general population for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and five studies for perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Predominately, most studies reported no statistically significant association between concentrations of PFAS and MetS. In the meta-analysis, the overall measure of effect was not statistically significant, showing no evidence of an association between concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS and the risk of MetS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, current small body of evidence does not support association between PFAS and MetS. However, due to limited number of studies and substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Further scrutinizing cohort studies are needed to evaluate the association between various and less well-known PFAS substances and their mixture with MetS and its components in both adults and children in different settings. © 2021 Maryam Zare Jeddi et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","fluorocarbon; adult; child; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; human; meta analysis; metabolic syndrome X; pollutant; toxicity; Adult; Child; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Metabolic Syndrome"

PFAS are a diverse set of chemicals that accumulate and transport quite differently in the environment depending on the length of their fluoroalkyl chains and their functional groups. This diversity in PFAS chemical characteristics combined with varying environmental factors also impact the bioaccumulation of these compounds in different organisms. In this review, we evaluate environmental factors (such as organic carbon, proteins, lipids, and dissolved cations) as well as PFAS characteristics (head group, chain-length, and concentration) that contribute to the significant variation seen in the literature of bioaccumulation metrics reported for organisms in aquatic ecosystems. Of the factors evaluated, it was found that PFAS concentration, dissolved organic matter, sediment organic matter, and biotransformation of precursor PFAS tended to significantly impact reported bioaccumulation metrics the most. Based on this review, it is highly suggested that future studies provide sufficient details of important environmental factors, specific organism traits/ behavior, and PFAS concentrations/compounds when reporting on bioaccumulation metrics to further fill data gaps and improve our understanding of PFAS in aquatic ecosystems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic organisms; Bioaccumulation; Biogeochemistry; Organic carbon; Water; Biotransformation; Environmental factors; Environmental pollutions; Exposure pathways; Fresh Water; Geochemical factors; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Substance concentrations; Trophic transfer; Aquatic ecosystems; fluorocarbon; fresh water; bioaccumulation; ecosystem; water pollutant; Bioaccumulation; Ecosystem; Fluorocarbons; Fresh Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The technologies present on the market to the present day still do not reach the ideal features desirable for such processes especially for the removal of highly recalcitrant compounds such as the Perfluorinated Alkyl Substances (PFAS) which are poorly abated using “traditional” Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs). The non-thermal plasma (NTP) treatment is a promising technology based on the production (in the water or immediately above the liquid) of a NTP capable of producing reactive species both in the liquid and gaseous phase. These species can react with stable and recalcitrant compounds (e.g. PFAS) up to their mineralization. In this review, the NTP technology and its applications in wastewater treatment are reviewed, starting from the physics of the plasma, the different processes and reactors proposed in the literature, and the nature of the reactive species generated during the plasma process. Attention is dedicated to the applications of NTP for the abatement of Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs), with a focus on PFAS removal. Furthermore, the effects of the natural components of the waters, such as Natural Organic Matter (NOM), pH, and conductivity on the efficiency of NTP-based treatment are discussed.

In this paper, we have reviewed and summarized the influence of PFAS exposure on health, pointing the quality of evidence, and applied translational techniques to integrate evidence for PFAS policy making. This is the first review where highly referred articles on PFAS used for policymaking by several regulatory agencies were collected and evaluated based on the review guidelines developed by the US National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) review guidelines. Several limitations were observed, including co-exposure to multiple chemicals and limited measurement of primary and secondary outcomes related to specific toxicity. However, data from all the studies provided a moderate to strong level of confidence for link between PFAS exposure and different adverse outcomes. Secondly, for translating the risk to humans, an in-silico model and scaling approach was utilized. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK) was used to calculate the human equivalent dose (HED) from two widely accepted studies and compared with tolerable daily intakes (TDIs) established by various regulatory agencies. Inter-species dose extrapolation was done to compare with human the relevance of dosing scenarios used in animals. Overall, a framework for translation of risk was proposed based on the conclusions of this review with the goal of improving policymaking.

The experienced synthetic chemist will probe many of these variables during reaction development and optimization, which will routinely involve investigation of reaction temperature, solvent, stoichiometry, concentration, time, choice of catalyst, addition sequence or quenching conditions just to name some commonly addressed variables. Remarkably, little attention is typically given to the choice of reaction vessel material as the surface of common laboratory borosilicate glassware is, incorrectly, assumed to be chemically inert. When reviewing the scientific literature, careful consideration of the vessel material is typically only given during the use of well-known glass-etching reagents such as HF, which is typically only handled in HF-resistant, polyfluorinated polymer vessels. However, there are examples of chemical transformations that do not involve such reagents but are still clearly influenced by the choice of reaction vessel material. In the following review, we wish to condense the most significant examples of vessel effects during chemical transformations as well as observations of container-dependent stability of certain molecules.

Remediation of environmental PFAS contamination and their presence in consumer products have led to the production of solid and liquid waste streams containing high concentrations of PFASs, which require efficient and cost-effective treatment solutions. PFASs are challenging to defluorinate by conventional and advanced destructive treatment processes, and physical separation processes produce waste streams (e.g., membrane concentrate, spent activated carbon) requiring further post-treatment. Incineration and other thermal treatment processes are widely available, but their use in managing PFAS-containing wastes remains poorly understood. Under specific operating conditions, thermal treatment is expected to mineralize PFASs, but the degradation mechanisms and pathways are unknown. In this review, we critically evaluate the thermal decomposition mechanisms, pathways, and byproducts of PFASs that are crucial to the design and operation of thermal treatment processes. We highlight the analytical capabilities and challenges and identify research gaps which limit the current understanding of safely applying thermal treatment to destroy PFASs as a viable end-of-life treatment process. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered the most widely used drugs worldwide and over the counter. The lack of legal norms that limit emission ranges in water bodies has been one of the main factors in the increase of these emerging pollutants (EC) in aquatic ecosystems. Studies based on the monitoring of these pharmaceutical compounds allow us to understand all aspects related to fate, concentration, distribution, effects, and physiological alterations that they cause in aquatic biota, for this reason, it is necessary to highlight the importance of bivalves as organisms, model and bioindicators. This review presents an overview of ecotoxicological studies that monitor NSAIDs and evaluates the responses of some species of bivalves in biomonitoring programs and toxicity tests. Negative effects of NSAIDs have been reported in aquatic environments to wild bivalves, in addition to causing biomagnification. With this study, it is expected to promote interest in scientific research in this little-explored area necessary for pharmacovigilance and biomonitoring of aquatic ecosystems. © 2022 Asociacion Espanola de Ecologia Terrestre.

The incidence of thyroid cancer appears to be rapidly and steadily increasing in recent decades, and studies have reported thyroid cancer to be the 4th most common cancer today, up from 14th in the early 1990s. This increase is due mainly to a variety of environmental factors, including radiation, smoking, obesity, pollutants such as pesticides, phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluorinated compounds, bromine flame retardants, perchlorates, nitrates and various elements such as metals, non-metals and metalloids. Some metals, including iron, copper, cad mium, lead, vanadium, chromium, manganese and nickel, are positively correlated with thyroid cancer, while others such as zinc and magnesium show a negative correlation. Other metals, such as molybdenum, tin and cobalt, appear to increase the incidence of thyroid cancer in combination, while sodium, mercury, aluminum and silver show no evidence of thyroid carcinogenicity. Of the non-metals, iodine and selenium deficiency are associated with carcinogenic effects on the thyroid, while there is no information on any relevant activity of phosphorus. Among the metalloids, boron is considered a goitrogenic element, and probably increases the incidence of thyroid cancer when it acts in combination with cadmium and molybdenum, taken in small non-toxic doses, for a long time. Finally, air pollution has been studied, and waste gases are associated with an increased incidence of cancer in various anatomical areas, including the thyroid. © Athens Medical Society.","aluminum; antithyroid agent; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; iron; lead; magnesium; manganese; mercury; metal; metalloid; molybdenum; nickel; nitric acid derivative; perchlorate; perfluoro compound; pesticide; phthalic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; silver; sodium; tin; toxic substance; vanadium; zinc; air pollution; cancer mortality; carcinogenicity; endocrine system; environment; environmental factor; human; incidence; iodine deficiency; obesity; radiation; Review; selenium deficiency; smoking; thyroid cancer"

Thousands of distinct PFAS exist in commerce. The 2019 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Action Plan outlines a multiprogram national research plan to address the challenge of PFAS. One component of this strategy involves the use of systematic evidence map (SEM) approaches to characterize the evidence base for hundreds of PFAS. OBJECTIVE: SEM methods were used to summarize available epidemiological and animal bioassay evidence for a set of ∼ 150 PFAS that were prioritized in 2019 by the U.S. EPA’s Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) for in vitro toxicity and toxicokinetic assay testing. METHODS: Systematic review methods were used to identify and screen literature using manual review and machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify mammalian animal bioassay and epidemiological studies that could inform human hazard identification. A variety of supplemental content was also tracked, including information on in vitro model systems; exposure measurement–only studies in humans; and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Animal bioassay and epidemiology studies meeting PECO criteria were summarized with respect to study design, and health system(s) were assessed. Because animal bioassay studies with ≥21-d exposure duration (or reproductive/developmental study design) were most useful to CCTE analyses, these studies underwent study evaluation and detailed data extraction. All data extraction is publicly available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata. RESULTS: More than 40,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes identified 44 animal and 148 epidemiology studies from the peer-reviewed literature and 95 animal and 50 epidemiology studies from gray literature that met PECO criteria. Epidemiological evidence (available for 15 PFAS) mostly assessed the reproductive, endocrine, developmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Animal evidence (available for 40 PFAS) commonly assessed effects in the reproductive, developmental, urinary, immunological, and hepatic systems. Overall, 45 PFAS had evidence across animal and epidemiology data streams. DISCUSSION: Many of the ∼ 150 PFAS were data poor. Epidemiological and animal evidence were lacking for most of the PFAS included in our search. By disseminating this information, we hope to facilitate additional assessment work by providing the initial scoping literature survey and identifying key research needs. Future research on data-poor PFAS will help support a more complete understanding of the potential health effects from PFAS exposures. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Omics technologies provide the tools required to investigate DNA, RNA, proteins, and other molecular determinants. These technologies include genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. However, proteomics is one of the main approaches to studying allergic disorders’ pathophysiology. Proteins are used to indicate normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. In this field, the principal goal of proteomics has been to discover new proteins and use them in precision medicine. Multiple technologies have been applied to proteomics, but that most used for identifying, quantifying, and profiling proteins is mass spectrometry (MS).

Biological activities have been studied experimentally in various laboratories, as well as data obtained using QSAR (Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationships) algorithms. According to the data obtained, it was shown that polyether toxins exhibit strong antibacterial, antimicrobial, antifungal, antitumor, and other activities. Along with this, it was found that natural polyether ionophores exhibit such properties as antiparasitic, antiprotozoal, cytostatic, anti-mycoplasmal, and antieczema activities. In addition, polyethers have been found to be potential regulators of lipid metabolism or inhibitors of DNA synthesis. Further study of the mechanisms of action and the search for new polyether ionophores and their derivatives may provide more effective therapeutic natural polyether ionophores for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. For some polyether ionophores, 3D graphs are presented, which demonstrate the predicted and calculated activities.

These chemicals are probably able to contribute not only to the development of obesity and metabolic disturbances in individuals, but also in their progeny, having the capability to epigenetically reprogram genetically inherited set-up points for body weight and body composition control during critical periods of development, such as fetal, early life, and puberty. In individuals, they may act on myriads of neuro-endocrine–immune metabolic regulatory pathways, leading to pathophysiological consequences in adipogenesis, lipogenesis, lipolysis, immunity, the influencing of central appetite and energy expenditure regulations, changes in gut microbiota–intestine functioning, and many other processes. Evidence-based medical data have recently brought much more convincing data about associations of particular chemicals and the probability of the raised risk of developing obesity. Foods are the main source of obesogens. Some obesogens occur naturally in food, but most are environmental chemicals, entering food as a foreign substance, whether in the form of contaminants or additives, and they are used in a large amount in highly processed food.

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is one of these sources, which converts syngas (a mixture of CO and H2) to a wide range of hydrocarbons. Liquid transportation fuels produced via FTS from biomass-derived syngas introduce an attractive, clean, carbon-neutral, and sustainable energy source. Reactor and catalyst designs play a significant role in the improvement of FTS efficiency. Flow hydrodynamics coupled with reaction kinetics makes this process challenging. Numerical methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can help us effectively understand the fluid dynamics within FT reactor. The main objective of CFD simulation for FTS can be summarized in three points (1) to analyze the conservation laws (mass, heat, and momentum transport) coupled with the catalytic reactions in the reactor, (2) to optimize the operating conditions to maximize the catalytic activity and selectivity to desired products, and (3) to support the reactor design and engineering. A CFD code consists of four steps: geometry generation, meshing, solver, and post-processing. Emerging data-driven techniques were also reviewed in this work to analyze the fluid dynamics of FTS.

However, their persistence in the environment, hazardous nature, and potential for bioaccumulation and long-range transport have alarmed an increasing number of scholars and research institutions. Although several literature reviews on PFASs research exist, only a few of them have considered bibliometric indices. In this study, 3,373 PFASs-related articles published between 2001 and 2018 were analyzed using a bibliometric analysis method based on the Science Citation Index (SCI) Expanded. The software tools for mapping knowledge domain (MKD) (VOSviewer and Science of Science (Sci2)) were used to analyze the performance of contributors and PFASs research topics, hotspots, and trends. Our results reveal that the number of PFASs-related articles published annually has increased significantly, with most originating from the United States (followed by those from China). The Chinese Academy of Sciences has published the most articles. A comprehensive analysis of title, keywords, and keywords plus showed that PFASs research hotspots include humans, precursors, and detection methods, with the main focuses being environmental science, toxicology, and environmental engineering. The four main research topics of PFASs were identified, and a literature review was carried out for each one. Overall, this study can supply researchers with a deeper understanding of the development of PFASs studies and provide a comprehensive data reference for researchers to further grasp the research direction in this field. © 2022","Publishing; Bibliometric; Bibliometrics analysis; Global trends; Hotspots; Literature reviews; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Research topics; Sci2; Vosviewer; Biochemistry; bioaccumulation; chemical substance; geochemical survey; spatiotemporal analysis; bibliometrics; China; environmental science; human; review; SciSearch; software; toxicology; trend study; United States; bibliometrics; publication; China; United States; fluorocarbon; Bibliometrics; China; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Publications; United States"

The properties that characterize are their low degradability as well as their resistance to water, oil and heat. This results in their high persistence in the environment and bioaccumulation in different organisms, causing many adverse effects on the environment as well as in human health. Some of their effects remain unknown to this day. As there are thousands of registered PFAS, it is difficult to apply traditional technologies for an efficient removal and detection for all. This has made it difficult for wastewater treatment plants to remove or degrade PFAS before discharging the effluents into the environment. Also, monitoring these contaminants depends mostly on chromatography-based methods, which require expensive equipment and consumables, making it difficult to detect PFAS in the environment. The detection of PFAS in the environment, and the development of technologies to be implemented in tertiary treatment of wastewater treatment plants are topics of high concern. This study focuses on analyzing and discussing the mechanisms of occurrence, migration, transformation, and fate of PFAS in the environment, as well the main adverse effects in the environment and human health. The following work reviews the recent advances in the development of PFAS detection technologies (biosensors, electrochemical sensors, microfluidic devices), and removal/degradation methods (electrochemical degradation, enzymatic transformation, advanced oxidation, photocatalytic degradation). Understanding the risks to public health and identifying the routes of production, transportation, exposure to PFAS is extremely important to implement regulations for the detection and removal of PFAS in wastewater and the environment.

Increasing evidence shows that plants are at a risk of being adversely affected by PFASs. This review concludes that PFASs are predominantly absorbed by roots from sources in the soil; besides, the review also discusses several factors such as soil properties and the species of PFASs and plants. In addition, following uptake by root, long-chain PFASs (C ≥ 7 for PFCA and C ≥ 6 for PFSA) were preferentially retained within the root, whereas the short-chain PFASs were distributed across tissues above the ground — according to the studies. The bioaccumulation potential of PFASs within various plant structures are further expressed by calculating bioaccumulation factor (BAF) across various plant species. The results show that PFASs have a wide range of BAF values within root tissue, followed by straw, and then grain. Furthermore, owing to its high water solubility than other PFASs, PFOA is the predominant compound accumulated in both the soil itself and within the plant tissues. Among different plant groups, the potential BAF values rank from highest to lowest as follows: leaf vegetables > root vegetables > flower vegetables > shoot vegetables. Several PFAS groups such as PFOA, PFBA, and PFOS, may have an increased public health risk based on the daily intake rate (ID). Finally, future research is suggested on the possible PFASs degradation occurring in plant tissues and the explanations at genetic-level for the metabolite changes that occur under PFASs stress. © 2022 The Author(s)",

The use of photoinduced technology is a common strategy that uses the outstanding oxidation or reduction ability of a photoredox catalyst in its excited state to generate perfluoroalkyl radicals from perfluoroalkyl halides. The perfluoroalkyl radicals thus obtained can undergo various subsequent reactions under mild conditions, such as ATRA reaction of alkenes, alkynes, and 1,n-enynes; carbo/heteroperfluoroalkylation of alkenes and isocyanides; and C H/F perfluoroalkylation.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) identified 24 PFASs of interest for further study and possible regulation. We examined 371 peer-reviewed studies published since 2001 to understand the occurrence and distribution of 24 priority PFASs in global surface waters and groundwater. We identified 77,541 and 16,246 data points for surface waters and groundwater, respectively, with total PFAS concentrations ranging from low pg/L to low mg/L levels. Most data were from Asia, Europe, and North America with some reports from Oceania. PFAS information from other geographic regions is lacking. PFASs levels are consistently higher in rivers and streams followed by lakes and reservoirs and then coastal and marine systems. When sufficient data were available, probabilistic environmental hazard assessments (PEHAs) were performed from environmental exposure distributions (EEDs) to identify potential exceedances of available guideline values for each compound by matrix, region, and aquatic system. Specifically, exceedances of USEPA drinking water lifetime health advisory levels were up to 74% for PFOS in groundwater from Oceania and 69% for PFOA in North American groundwater. Our findings support selection of environmentally relevant experimental treatment levels for future toxicology, ecotoxicology and bioaccumulation studies, and potable source water exposure investigations, while highlighting PFASs and major geographic locations requiring additional study and inclusion in global monitoring and surveillance campaigns. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biochemistry; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental regulations; Health hazards; Health risks; Potable water; Public health; Reservoirs (water); Risk assessment; Surface waters; Water quality; Drinking-water qualities; Environmental health; Hazard and risk assessments; Hazard Assessment; Military products; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Probabilistics; Surface water and groundwaters; United States environmental protection agency; Groundwater; drinking water; ground water; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; surface water; alkanesulfonic acid; drinking water; fluorocarbon; concentration (composition); drinking water; groundwater; hazard assessment; risk assessment; surfactant; water quality; Asia; bioaccumulation; ecotoxicology; environmental exposure; environmental health; environmental monitoring; environmental surveillance; Europe; experimental therapy; geography; health hazard; human; lake ecosystem; marine environment; nonhuman; North America; peer review; publication; Review; river ecosystem; water pollution; water supply; environmental health; water pollutant; United States; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Drinking Water; Environmental Health; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Groundwater; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

As electrochemical redox reactions can provide green and efficient pathways for the activation of sulfonyl compounds, studies for electrosynthesis have rapidly increased.

This continued supply and use, despite strong evidence of negative impacts, is not unique to chemicals management. In the field of climate change, the concept of ""lock-in"" has been used to explain the complex interactions among economic, social, technological, and political dynamics that reinforce global reliance on the extraction and use of fossil fuels. Learning from carbon ""lock-in"" phenomena, this Perspective explores the challenges of chemicals management from the perspective of lock-in through three case studies: paraquat, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), and asbestos. These case studies illustrate that most current chemicals management frameworks fail to address the concerns arising from this complex interplay by not involving all relevant stakeholder groups that are part of lock-in, from producers to consumers. This results in a relatively narrow consideration (e.g., only demand but not supply) of the effectiveness and consequences of regulations. We submit that to break lock-in and address the global threat of chemical pollution, current approaches to managing hazardous chemicals should be broadened to take a comprehensive approach to understanding and managing factors contributing to lock-in, notably both supply and demand on national and international scales. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

However, the reactivity, removal efficiency, transformation products (TPs), and mechanisms of such emerging pollutants by different treatment processes have not been well elucidated. Particularly, the transformation-driven environmental risks have been mostly overlooked. Therefore, we present a review to address these issues from chemical and toxicological viewpoints. Four degradation systems can be largely classified as catalytic persulfate (PS) oxidation, non-catalytic oxidation, photolysis and photocatalysis, and biodegradation. It was found that bisphenol alternatives possess distinct reactivities with different oxidizing species, with the highest performance for hydroxyl radicals. All systems exhibit superior elimination efficiency for these compounds. The inadequate mineralization suggests the formation of recalcitrant TPs, from which the overall reaction pathways are proposed. The combined experimental and in silico analysis indicates that many TPs have developmental toxicity, endocrine-disrupting effects, and genotoxicity. Notably, catalytic PS systems and non-catalytic oxidation result in the formation of coupling products as well as halogenated TPs with higher acute and chronic toxicity and lower biodegradability than the parent compounds. In contrast, photolysis and photocatalysis generate hydroxylated and bond-cleavage TPs with less toxicity. Overall, this review highlights the secondary environmental risks from the transformation of bisphenol alternatives by conventional and emerging treatment processes. Finally, future perspectives are recommended to address the knowledge gaps of these contaminants in aquatic ecosystems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic ecosystems; Biodegradability; Biodegradation; Catalytic oxidation; Chemical bonds; Efficiency; Endocrine disrupters; Hydroxylation; Photocatalysis; Photolysis; Alternative; Aqueous transformation; Bisphenols; Ecotoxicity; Environmental risks; Non-catalytic; Secondary environmental risk; Transformation mechanisms; Transformation products; Treatment process; Phenols; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; hydroxyl radical; ion; organic matter; water; aqueous solution; chemical compound; chemical pollutant; environmental risk; photolysis; toxicology; aquatic environment; biodegradability; biodegradation; chronic toxicity; computer model; developmental toxicity; ecotoxicity; hydroxylation; mineralization; nonhuman; oxidation; photocatalysis; photolysis; reaction analysis; Review; toxicology; water treatment; analysis; bioremediation; ecosystem; toxicity; water pollutant; Biodegradation, Environmental; Ecosystem; Photolysis; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent synthetic chemicals widely used in industry and consumer products and bioaccumulate in food webs and human tissues, such as the liver. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis evaluating PFAS exposure and evidence of liver injury from rodent and epidemiological studies. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched for all studies from earliest available indexing year through 1 December 2021 using keywords corresponding to PFAS exposure and liver injury. For data synthesis, results were limited to studies in humans and rodents assessing the following indicators of liver injury: serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or steatosis. For human studies, at least three observational studies per PFAS were used to conduct a weighted z-score meta-analysis to determine the direction and significance of associations. For rodent studies, data were synthesized to qualitatively summarize the direction and significance of effect. RESULTS: Our search yielded 85 rodent studies and 24 epidemiological studies, primarily of people from the United States. Studies focused primarily on legacy PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid. Meta-analyses of human studies revealed that higher ALT levels were associated with exposure to PFOA (z-score = 6.20, p < 0:001), PFOS (z-score = 3.55, p < 0:001), and PFNA (z-score = 2.27, p = 0:023). PFOA exposure was also associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in humans. In rodents, PFAS exposures consistently resulted in higher ALT levels and steatosis. CONCLUSION: There is consistent evidence for PFAS hepatotoxicity from rodent studies, supported by associations of PFAS and markers of liver function in observational human studies. This review identifies a need for additional research evaluating next-generation PFAS, mixtures, and early life exposures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10092. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

This paper provides a systematic review of the research advances in the novel environmentally friendly suppressant, C6F12O. Considering the principle of screening fire suppressants, the physical and chemical properties of C6F12O are presented first. Specifically, research on the measurement of the thermodynamic parameters, toxicity, corrosion, environmental compatibility and dispersion characteristics are summarized, revealing that the poor dispersibility, corrosion of the hydrolysates (perfluoropropionic acid), corrosion and toxicity of thermal breakdown products such as HF and COF2 and environmentally unfriendly products such as perfluorocarbons should be paid more attention. Three main synthesis routes of C6F12O are also introduced in view of its promising prospects for application. Furthermore, the fire extinguishing efficiency of C6F12O has been fully investigated in both a laboratory burner scale and full-scale fire extinguishing experiment, the results of which show that the minimum extinguishing volume concentration of C6F12O is lower than HFCs, but the mass concentration is much higher. Although C6F12O has shown satisfactory fire extinguishing performance in various fire protection scenarios, fire enhancement phenomenon and the large production of HF have been observed during fire extinguishment. Finally, the fire extinguishing mechanism of C6F12O has been discussed. The flame suppression effect of C6F12O, combustion enhancement phenomenon and the influence of water in the reaction zone have been revealed. This review fully evaluates C6F12O, in hope that it will provide a reference for follow-up research and the development of a halon replacement. © 2022 by the authors.

Recent Findings: Eleven human studies published before April 1st, 2021 were identified through database searches (PubMed, Dimensions, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus), and citation chaining (Citationchaser). The sample sizes of these studies ranged from 40 to 965, involving children and adolescents (n = 3), non-pregnant adults (n = 5), or pregnant women (n = 3). High-resolution liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was the primary analytical platform to measure both PFAS and metabolome. PFAS were measured in either plasma (n = 6) or serum (n = 5), while metabolomic profiles were assessed using plasma (n = 6), serum (n = 4), or urine (n = 1). Four types of PFAS (perfluorooctane sulfonate (n = 11), perfluorooctanoic acid (n = 10), perfluorohexane sulfonate (n = 9), perfluorononanoic acid (n = 5)) and PFAS mixtures (n = 7) were the most studied. We found that alterations to tryptophan metabolism and the urea cycle were most reported PFAS-associated metabolomic signatures. Numerous lipid metabolites were also suggested to be associated with PFAS exposure, especially key metabolites in glycerophospholipid metabolism which is critical for biological membrane functions, and fatty acids and carnitines which are relevant to the energy supply pathway of fatty acid oxidation. Other important metabolome changes reported included the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle regarding energy generation, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism in cellular energy systems. Conclusions: There is growing interest in using non-targeted metabolomics to study the human physiological changes associated with PFAS exposure. Multiple PFAS were reported to be associated with alterations in amino acid and lipid metabolism, but these results are driven by one predominant type of pathway analysis thus require further confirmation. Standardizing research methods and reporting are recommended to facilitate result comparison. Future studies should consider potential differences in study methodology, use of prospective design, and influence from confounding bias and measurement errors. © 2022","Amino acids; Biomolecules; Cytology; Fatty acids; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; Organic pollutants; Physiology; Search engines; Urea; Epidemiological studies; Exposome; Human study; Metabolic pathways; Metabolomes; Metabolomics; Non-targeted; Perfluorinated compounds; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Scoping review; Metabolism; carnitine; fatty acid; glycerophospholipid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; purine; pyrimidine; tricarboxylic acid; tryptophan; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; epidemiology; fatty acid; lipid; metabolism; metabolite; oxidation; persistent organic pollutant; physiology; adolescent; adult; aged; amino acid metabolism; biomembrane; blood analysis; cell energy; citric acid cycle; comparative study; energy resource; environmental exposure; epidemiology; fatty acid oxidation; female; human; lipid metabolism; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; metabolic regulation; metabolomics; middle aged; pregnant woman; publication; purine metabolism; pyrimidine metabolism; Review; sample size; urea cycle; urinalysis; child; metabolomics; pollutant; pregnancy; prospective study; Adolescent; Adult; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Child; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Metabolomics; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies"

Fluorinated surfactants are a major PFAS subgroup. Their widespread use has resulted in their release into the environment and accumulation in water. The sequestration of PFAS from aqueous solution by adsorption is a pressing and challenging environmental pollution problem which necessitates surface and colloid science to offer solutions for the benefit of a sustainable future. In this review, we first provide an overview of the aqueous solution and self-assembly properties of common PFAS surfactants. Next, we discuss physical adsorption of PFAS surfactants, which is the first step used to concentrate PFAS prior to their subsequent proper disposal or destruction, with a focus on “natural” materials such as activated carbon and biopolymers, and on surfactant/surface/colloid aspects.

However, owing to the original release and alternative usage, continuous accumulation of PFAS has been reported in environmental and human samples, with uncertain consequences for ecosystem and human health. It is crucial to promote and improve existing analytical techniques to facilitate the detection of trace amounts of PFAS in diverse environmental matrices.

Therefore, advanced technologies for tertiary wastewater treatment have been widely studied in recent decades. These treatments have been reviewed over the years mainly providing comparisons from a technical perspective. However, there is a lack of a holistic evaluation considering environmental and economic aspects together with the aforementioned technical aspects. In this review, treatment alternatives for micropollutant and pathogen abatement have been identified based on technologies implemented on a large scale (ozonation, ultraviolet treatment, adsorption on activated carbon or membrane filtration) as well as those treatments in the process of implementation, such as electrochemical, Fenton-based or photocatalytic techniques. Thus, a systematic bibliographic search was performed considering works applying pilot and full-scale equipment, leaving lab-scale results out of the analysis. The description of each process allowed the identification of the technical feasibility, operating costs and associated environmental impacts, providing a comparative assessment that will help decision-making in the development and application of the different technologies. The benchmarking results reveal that the selected treatment should be chosen based on the source and specific pollutants present in the wastewater, as there is no single solution for the treatment of micropollutants and pathogens.

We aim to list and discuss occurrence and treatment efficiencies, develop a new way to characterize mobile compounds by their basic properties, and provide a report of status and research needs on aquatic and multimedia models. The compound groups include selected per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and other compounds. Octanol-water distribution coefficients (D) are calculated for PFAS by an expression including octanol-water partition coefficients (P) and ionization (Ka) constants, and by using Chemicalize.com for multi-protic PPCPs and other compounds. Log D ranges between − 6 and 0 for PFAS and between − 8 and 5 for PPCPs and pesticides. This is significantly lower than the ranges of P for nonpolar compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Many pharmaceuticals and potential endocrine disruptors can be removed effectively in source, finished and distribution supply water through sorption, chemical oxidation, photolysis, and biodegradation. Sediment core profiles of polar organics may not reflect the chronology of their production and use, due to post-depositional mobility of the relatively water-soluble compounds. A novel approach for identifying mobile compounds is developed using sediment records extending downcore past authorization or initiation dates for the compounds. We find that an area limited by log water solubility µmol/L &gt; 4.2 and log D &lt; −0.8 approximately defines an area of mobile compounds here represented by perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA) and atenolol. Models in the aquatic or multimedia phases have been developed for PFAS with a hydrodynamic model; for insecticides and fungicides using geographic information system (GIS) and fugacity equations; and for atrazine and pharmaceuticals, considering mass flow. Global models were proposed and tested for PFAS and diclofenac.

In this work, combined with the existing relevant research, the migration and transformation law and ecotoxicity characteristics of MAs in the environment are summarized, and the removal mechanism of MAs is clarified. Currently, most studies on MAs are based on laboratory simulation experiments, and there are few studies on the migration and transformation mechanism between multiphase states. In addition, the cost of MAs removal technology is not satisfactory. Therefore, the following suggestions are put forward for the future research direction. The migration and transformation process of MAs between multiphase states (such as soil–water–sediment) should be focused on. Apart from exploring the new treatment technology of MAs, the upgrading and coupling of existing MAs removal technologies to meet emission standards and reduce costs should also be concerned.

However, recently halodefluorination has undergone many developments. The reaction can be effected with a range of metal halide sources (including s-block, f-block, and pblock metals), and has been developed into a catalytic process. Furthermore, methods for monoselective halodefluorination in polyfluorocarbons have been developed, allowing exchange of only a single fluorine with a heavier halogen. The reaction has also found use in cascade processes, where the final product may not even contain a halide, but where the conversion of fluorine to a more reactive halogen is a pivotal reaction step in the cascade.

Although attention to effects of exposure to mixtures of PFAS has grown in recent years, there is no consensus on the appropriate statistical methods that can be used to assess their combined effect on human health. Objectives: We aim to perform a comprehensive review of the statistical methods used in the existing studies which evaluate the association between exposure to mixtures of PFAS and any adverse human health effect. Methods: The online databases PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched for eligible studies, published during the last ten years (last search performed on April 08, 2021). Covidence software was used by two different reviewers to perform a title/abstract screening, followed by a full text revision of the selected papers. Results: A total of 3640 papers were identified, and after the screening process, 53 papers were included in the current review. Most of the studies were published between 2019 and 2021 and were conducted mainly in North America and Europe; more than half of the studies (28 out of 53) were conducted on mother and child pairs. WQS (Weighted Quantile Sum) Regression and BKMR (Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression) were used in 36 out of 53 papers to model mixtures’ effects. Health outcomes included in the studies are immunotoxicity (n = 8), fetal development (n = 7), neurodevelopment (n = 9), reproductive hormones (n = 6), thyroid hormones (n = 7), outcomes related to metabolic pathways (n = 16). Conclusion: Studies on human exposure to PFAS as complex mixtures and health consequences have substantially increased in the last few years. Based on our findings, we propose that addressing risk from PFAS mixtures will likely require combinations of approaches and implementation of constantly evolving statistical methods. Specific guidelines and tools for quality assessment and publication of mixture observational studies are warranted. © 2021","alkyl group; environmental chemical; perfluoroalkanoic acid; sex hormone; thyroid hormone; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; thyroid hormone; chemical substance; health impact; literature review; pollution exposure; public health; statistical analysis; adolescent; adult; aged; Bayes theorem; child; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; clinical outcome; controlled study; environmental exposure; Europe; female; fetus development; health hazard; homeostasis; hormone metabolism; human; immunotoxicity; k means clustering; least square analysis; male; nerve cell differentiation; nervous system development; North America; outcome assessment; population exposure; Review; risk assessment; structural equation modeling; systematic review; thyroid gland; pollutant; toxicity; Europe; North America; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Bayes Theorem; Child; Environmental Pollutants; Europe; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Thyroid Hormones"

Outside red blood cells, the Hb tetramer dissociates into dimers, which exhibit high oxygen affinity and neither cooperativity nor allosteric regulation. They are prone to extravasate, thus scavenging endothelial NO and causing hypertension, and cause nephrotoxicity. In addition, they are more prone to autoxidation, generating radicals. The need to overcome the adverse effects associated with cell-free Hb has always been a major hurdle in the development of substitutes of allogeneic blood transfusions for all clinical situations where blood is unavailable or cannot be used due to, for example, religious objections. This class of therapeutics, indicated as hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs), is formed by genetically and/or chemically modified Hbs. Many efforts were devoted to the exploitation of the wealth of biochemical and biophysical information available on Hb structure, function, and dynamics to design safe HBOCs, overcoming the negative effects of free plasma Hb. Unfortunately, so far, no HBOC has been approved by FDA and EMA, except for compassionate use.

Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on PFAS exposure and birth outcomes. Methods: Three electronic databases were searched for epidemiological studies through February 13, 2021. We used random-effects meta-analysis for eight birth outcome indicators to calculate summary effect estimates for various exposure types. The risk of bias and the overall quality and level of evidence for each exposure-outcome pair were assessed. Results: The initial search identified 58 potentially eligible studies, of which 46 were ultimately included. Many PFAS were found to have previously unrecognized statistically significant associations with birth outcomes. Specifically, birth weight (BW) was associated with PFAS, with effect sizes ranging from −181.209 g (95% confidence interval (CI) = −360.620 to −1.798) per 1 ng/ml increase in perfluoroheptanesulfonate (PFHpS) to −24.252 g (95% CI = −38.574 to −9.930) per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase in perfluorodecaoic acid (PFDA). Similar patterns were observed between other PFAS and birth outcomes: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) with birth length (BL) and ponderal index (PI), PFOS and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA) with head circumference (HC), PFHpS with gestational age (GA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and PFHpS with preterm birth (PTB). Additionally, PFDA showed a statistically significant association with small for gestational age (SGA). The level of the combined evidence for each exposure-outcome pair was considered to be “moderate”. Conclusion: This study showed that PFAS exposure was significantly associated with increased risks of various adverse birth outcomes and that different birth outcome indicators had different degrees of sensitivity to PFAS.

Reperfusion may be a necessary condition for positive effects of neuroprotective treatments. This systematic review provides an overview of efficacy of neuroprotective agents in combination with reperfusion therapy in AIS. Methods: A literature search was performed on the following databases, namely PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Emcare. All databases were searched up to September 23rd 2021. All randomized controlled trials in which patients were treated with neuroprotective strategies within 12 h of stroke onset in combination with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), endovascular therapy (EVT), or both were included. Results: We screened 1,764 titles/abstracts and included 30 full reports of unique studies with a total of 16,160 patients. In 15 studies neuroprotectants were tested for clinical efficacy, where all patients had to receive reperfusion therapies, either IVT and/or EVT. Heterogeneity in reported outcome measures was observed. Treatment was associated with improved clinical outcome for: 1) uric acid in patients treated with EVT and IVT, 2) nerinetide in patients who underwent EVT without IVT, 3) imatinib in stroke patients treated with IVT with or without EVT, 4) remote ischemic perconditioning and IVT, and 5) high-flow normobaric oxygen treatment after EVT, with or without IVT. Conclusion: Studies specifically testing effects of neuroprotective agents in addition to IVT and/or EVT are scarce. Future neuroprotection studies should report standardized functional outcome measures and combine neuroprotective agents with reperfusion therapies in AIS or aim to include prespecified subgroup analyses for treatment with IVT and/or EVT.

There has been tremendous progress in the technologies needed to address the concerns that conventional and novel water contaminants pose. Yet, to date, only a few relatively small DPR operations have been installed. As we get closer to the point where regulations are finalized and serious investments are planned, there is a need to ask: Are we ready? In this Review, we explore the technological, economic, and environmental considerations associated with DPR. In particular, we focus on the status of technologies for addressing the most challenging water pollutants, the cost estimates for DPR, and the energy demand and associated implications of DPR. We find that, although the technologies are nearly ready for DPR, the most critical issue will be real-time monitoring of a number of molecules that pose distinct challenges to advanced treatment trains. In addition, there is a need to consider emergency planning, both in terms of emergency buffer reservoir(s) and planning for situations in which the treated water does not meet specifications. Since any advanced treatment train will result in a significant increase in embedded energy, it will be particularly important to plan for renewable energy to minimize environmental impacts. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",

Due to their extensive use and chemical stability, PFAS are ubiquitous environmental contaminants and as such, form an emerging risk factor for male reproductive health. The long half-lives of PFAS is of particular concern as the propensity to accumulate in biological systems prolong the time taken for excretion, taking years in many cases. Accordingly, there is mounting evidence supporting a negative association between PFAS exposure and an array of human health conditions. However, inconsistencies among epidemiological and experimental findings have hindered the ability to definitively link negative reproductive outcomes to specific PFAS exposure. This situation highlights the requirement for further investigation and the identification of reliable biological models that can inform health risks, allowing sensitive assessment of the spectrum of effects of PFAS exposure on humans. Here, we review the literature on the biological effects of PFAS exposure, with a specific focus on male reproduction, owing to its utility as a sentinel marker of general health. Indeed, male infertility has increasingly been shown to serve as an early indicator of a range of co-morbidities such as coronary, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases. It follows that adverse associations have been established between PFAS exposure and the incidence of testicular dysfunction, including pathologies such as testicular cancer and a reduction in semen quality. We also give consideration to the mechanisms that render the male reproductive tract vulnerable to PFAS mediated damage, and discuss novel remediation strategies to mitigate the negative impact of PFAS contamination and/or to ameliorate the PFAS load of exposed individuals.

Owing to their adverse effects on human health and environment, efficient methods of their removal from various complex matrices need to be developed. This review focuses on recent results addressing the adsorption of PFAS on activated carbons (AC) and metal-organic frameworks (MOF). While the former are well-established adsorbents used in water treatment, the latter are relatively new and still not applied at a large scale. Nevertheless, they attract research interests owing to their developed porosity and versatile surface chemistry. While AC provide high volumes of pores and hydrophobic surfaces to strongly attract fluorinated chains, MOF supply sites for acid-base complexation and a variety of specific interactions. The modifications of AC are focused on the introduction of basicity to attract PFAS anions via electrostatic/chemical interactions, and those of MOF - on structural defects to increase the pore sizes. Based on the comparison of the performance and specifically adsorption forces provided by these two groups of materials, activated carbons were pointed out as worthy of further research efforts. This is because their surface, especially that in large pores, where dispersive forces are week and where extensive pore space might be utilized to adsorb more PFAS, can be further chemically modified and these modifications might be informed by the mechanisms of PFAS adsorption, which are specific for MOF. This review emphasizes the effects of these modifications on the adsorption mechanism and brings the critical assessment of the advantages/disadvantages of both groups as PFAS adsorbents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Activated carbon treatment; Adsorption; Alkalinity; Hydrophobicity; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Pore size; Surface chemistry; Adsorption performance; Adverse effect; Aliphatic compound; Health and environment; Human environment; Human health; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Activated carbon; charcoal; fluorocarbon; metal organic framework; adsorption; human; water pollutant; Adsorption; Charcoal; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Costs and contaminant concerns (e.g., per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances [PFAS]) are challenging widely used landfilling and land application practices. These circumstances are partly driving the re-emergence of pyrolysis and gasification technologies along with beneficial reuse prospects of the char solid residual. Previously, technologies experienced operational challenges leading to revised configurations, such as directly coupling a thermal oxidizer to the reactor to destroy tar forming compounds. This paper provides an overview of pyrolysis and gasification technologies, characteristics of the char product, air emission considerations, and potential fate of PFAS and other pollutants through the systems. Results from a survey of viable suppliers illustrate differences in commercially available options. Additional research is required to validate performance over the long-term operation and confirm contaminant fate, which will help determine whether resurging interest in pyrolysis and gasification warrants widespread adoption. Practitioner Points: Pyrolysis and gasification systems are re-emerging in the wastewater industry. Direct coupling of thermal oxidizers and other modifications offered by contemporary systems aim to overcome past failures. Process conditions when coupled with a thermal oxidizer will likely destroy most organic contaminants, including PFAS, but requires additional research.

The presence of the so‐called emerging pollutants in the different water bodies, impossible to eliminate through conventional biological and physical treatments used in wastewater treatment plants due to their persistent and recalcitrant nature, means that pollution continues growing throughout the world. The presence of these emerging pollutants involves serious risks to human and animal health for aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Therefore, in recent years, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been postulated as a viable, innovative and efficient technology for the elimination of these types of compounds from water bodies. The oxidation/reduction reactions triggered in most of these processes require a suitable catalyst. The most recent research focuses on the use and development of different types of heterogeneous catalysts, which are capable of overcoming some of the operational limitations of homogeneous processes such as the generation of metallic sludge, difficult separation of treated water and narrow working pH.

In this study, the related published articles with sampling years from 2010 to 2020 were reviewed, and the concentration levels, composition characteristics and possible sources of PFASs in surface water (rivers and lakes) and precipitation in China were summarized, including those in the Tibetan Plateau region. The results show that the concentrations of PFASs in surface water in different areas of China vary greatly, ranging from 0.775 to 1.06 × 106 ng/L. The production processes of fluorinated manufacturing facilities (FMFs) and sewage discharge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPS) were the main sources of PFASs in surface water in China, and the concentrations of PFASs in water flowing through cities with high urbanization increased significantly compared with those before water flowed through cities with high urbanization. The compositions of PFASs in surface water gradually changed from long-chain PFASs, such as per-fluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA) and per-fluoro-octanesulfonic acid (PFOS) to short-chain PFASs, such as per-fluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), per-fluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and per-fluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA). The concentrations of PFASs in precipitation in China ranged from 4.2 to 191 ng/L, which were lower than those of surface water. The precipitation concentrations were relatively high around a fluorination factory and in areas with high urbanization levels. PFASs were detected in the surface water and precipitation in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is the global “roof of the world”, but the concentrations were low (0.115–6.34 ng/L and 0.115–1.24 ng/L, respectively). Local human activities and surface runoff were the main sources of PFASs in the surface water of the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, under the influence of the Southeast Asian monsoon in summers, marine aerosols from the Indian Ocean and air pollutants from human activities in Southeast Asia and South Asia will also enter the water bodies through dry and wet depositions. With the melting of glaciers caused by global warming, the concentration of PFASs in the surface water of the TP was higher than that before the melting of glaciers flowed into the surface water of the TP. Generally, this study summarized the existing research progress of PFAS studies on surface water and precipitation in China and identified the research gaps, which deepened the researchers’ understanding of this field and provided scientific support for related research in the future. The concentrations of PFASs in the water bodies after flowing through FMFs were significantly higher than those before water flowed through FMFs, so the discharge of the FMF production process was one of the main sources of PFASs in surface water. © 2022 by the authors.

To increase awareness of this relationship in environmental epidemiology, we reviewed the available epidemiologic data on menstrual bleeding and PFAS concentrations. Recent Findings: Initial epidemiologic studies reported generally higher PFAS concentrations in men, menopausal women, and those with a history of hysterectomy compared to premenopausal women. Although subsequent studies investigating menstrual cycle characteristics observed somewhat discrepant results for menstrual irregularity and cycle length, consistent associations have been observed between heavy menstrual bleeding and lower PFAS concentrations. Summary: This review highlights the important role of menstrual bleeding on the excretion of PFAS. Given the high prevalence of menstrual bleeding in the population and the implications for environmental epidemiology, we provide recommendations to move this field forward. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","fluorocarbon; female; human; pollutant; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans"

In the future, tailored treatment methods are therefore of increasing significance for accurate removal of target pollutants in different water matrices. This critical review focuses on the overall strategies for accurately removing highly toxic emerging pollutants in the presence of typical interferents. The main difficulties hindering the improvement of selectivity in complex matrices are analyzed, implying that it is difficult to adopt a universal approach for multiple targets and water substrates. Selective methods based on assorted principles are proposed aiming to improve the anti-interference ability. Thus, typical approaches and fundamentals to achieve selectivity are subsequently summarized including their mechanism, superiority and inferior position, application scope, improvement method and the bottlenecks. The results show that different methods may be applicable to certain conditions and target pollutants. To better understand the mechanism of each selective method and further select the appropriate method, advanced methods for qualitative and quantitative characterization of selectivity are presented. The processes of adsorption, interaction, electron transfer, and bond breaking are discussed. Some comparable selective quantitative methods are helpful for promoting the development of related fields. The research framework of selectivity removal and its fundamentals are established. Presently, although continuous advances and remarkable achievements have been attained in the selective removal of characteristic organic pollutants, there are still various substantial challenges and opportunities. It is hopeful to inspire the researches on the new generation of water and wastewater treatment technology, which can selectively and preferentially treat characteristic pollutants, and establish a reliable research framework to lead the direction of environmental science. © 2022 American Chemical Society","Chemicals removal (water treatment); Environmental technology; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Accurate removal; Advanced treatment; Complex water matrix; Emerging pollutants; Interferents; Research frameworks; Selective mechanism; Target pollutants; Toxic organic pollutant; Water matrices; Organic pollutants; organic pollutant; organizational framework; toxic substance; acid base balance; chemical bond; electron transport; environmental science; molecular recognition; quantitative analysis; Review; static electricity; surface property; waste component removal; waste water management; water pollutant; adsorption; pollutant; wastewater; water management; water; Adsorption; Environmental Pollutants; Waste Water; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification"

Due to greater restrictions on PFOS globally in recent years, the production and use of F-53B correspondingly increased, consequently causing more emissions into the environment. In China, an increasing number of studies report frequent detection and broad exposure to F-53B in the natural environment, various wildlife and the human body.

Most of these SCs are potent cannabinoid receptor agonists that were initially developed to carry out scientific research but were lately hijacked by the illegal clandestine drug operators. SCs psychoactive effects, along with their dubious legitimate status, have made them notoriously attractive for clandestine recreational purposes. Many SC-containing products are labelled “Not for Human Consumption” in an effort to bypass regulation that prohibits the selling and manufacturing of such substances for human usage. SCs solutions are splashed onto herbal stuff and marketed as “herbal incense” worldwide. JWH-073, JWH-018, and CP 47,497, along with their C6, C7, and C8 analogs were the very first SCs detected by following the exploratory forensic analysis of seized botanical materials and street drugs. The number of these psychoactive compounds have grown over time, and appeared in the market as street drugs. These include numerous diverse classes of compounds having psychotropic properties which were characterized and identified. Governments all over the world are taking measures to prohibit and regulate these drugs of abuse.

Moreover, inefficient prevalent wastewater treatment technologies combined with increased industrial activity and modernization has led to increase in the concentration of toxic metals and radioactive components in the natural water bodies. However, for the improvement of ecosystem of rivers, lakes, and other water sources different physicochemical methods such as membrane filtration, reverse osmosis, activated carbon adsorption, electrocoagulation, and other electrochemical treatment are employed, which are uneconomical and insufficient for the complete abatement of these emerging pollutants. Therefore, the application of bioremediation employing aquatic macrophytes and microphytes have gained considerable importance owing to the benefits of cost-effectiveness, eco-friendly, and higher energy efficiency. Thus, the present review aims to enlighten the readers on the potential application of algae, cyanobacteria, plant, and other aquatic micro- and macrophytes for the elimination of carcinogenic metals and radioactive isotopes from wastewater. Additionally, the use of transgenic plants, genetically modified species, algal–bacterial symbiosis for the enhancement of removal efficiency of mutagenic contaminants are also highlighted.

This review discusses the most common methods of eliminating EDCs through preliminary, primary, secondary and tertiary treatments. The adsorption process is favoured for EDC removal, as it is an economical and straightforward option. The NABC aspects, which are the need, approach, benefits and challenges, were analysed based on existing circumstances, highlighting biochar as a green and renewable adsorbent for the removal of organic contaminants. From the environmental point of view, the effectiveness of this method, which uses natural fibre from the kenaf plant as a porous and economical biochar material with a selected lignocellulosic biomass, provides insights into the advantages of biochar-derived adsorbents. Essentially, the improvement of the natural fibre as an adsorbent is a focus, using carbonisation, activation, and the physiochemical process to enhance the adsorption ability of the material for pollutants in bodies of water.

Environmental cleanup by bioremediation is not considered practical currently. Implementation of bioremediation will require uncovering and understanding the rare microbial successes in degrading these compounds. This review discusses the underlying reasons why microbial degradation of heavily fluorinated compounds is rare. Fluorinated and chlorinated compounds are very different with respect to chemistry and microbial physiology. Moreover, the end product of biodegradation, fluoride, is much more toxic than chloride.

Due to their unique chemical properties, widespread production, environmental distribution, long-term persistence, bioaccumulative potential, and associated risks for human health, PFAS have been classified as persistent organic pollutants of significant concern. Scientific evidence from the last several decades suggests that their widespread occurrence in the environment correlates with adverse effects on human health and ecology. The presence of PFAS in the aquatic environment demonstrates a close link between the anthroposphere and the hydrological cycle, and concentrations of PFAS in surface and groundwater range in value along the ng L−1–μg L−1 scale. Here, we critically reviewed the research published in the last decade on the global occurrence and distribution of PFAS in the aquatic environment. Ours is the first paper to critically evaluate the occurrence of PFAS at the continental scale and the evolving global regulatory responses to manage and mitigate the adverse human health risks posed by PFAS. The review reports that PFAS are widespread despite being phased out—they have been detected in different continents irrespective of the level of industrial development. Their occurrence far from the potential sources suggests that long-range atmospheric transport is an important pathway of PFAS distribution. Recently, several studies have investigated the health impacts of PFAS exposure—they have been detected in biota, drinking water, food, air, and human serum. In response to the emerging information about PFAS toxicity, several countries have provided administrative guidelines for PFAS in water, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Germany, and Australia. In the US, additional regulatory measures are under consideration. Further, many PFAS have now been listed as persistent organic pollutants.

Because FTs are in near constant contact with human milk and/or formula, rapid and extensive bacterial growth is possible. Due to their immature immunologic and gastrointestinal (GI) systems, infants may be at significant health risk due to FT colonization. In adults, length of time FTs remain in place (dwell time) affects the degree of colonization and biofilm formation which is important in infants whose tubes remain in place up to 30 days. Objective: The purpose of this review was to describe and summarize the evidence regarding FT bacterial colonization in infants and identify gaps needing further investigation. Methods: Medline, CINAHL, and Embase databases were searched for clinical and/or laboratory-based observational and randomized controlled studies investigating the presence of bacteria in neonatal FTs. Results: This review of 10 studies found evidence that neonatal FTs may contain high quantities of potentially pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria and longer dwell times may increase the bacterial load. Furthermore, evidence suggests FT colonization may be nosocomial in origin and contribute to adverse infant health. Feeding tubes are an unrecognized source of bacterial colonization which may increase morbidity in premature infants and thus the presence of bacteria in FTs is an important area of investigation in the nutritional care of vulnerable infants in the NICU. Implications: Further appropriately powered studies which are clinically based, use appropriate analyses, and control for potential covariates are necessary to make clinical recommendations.

Worldwide detection of legacy and emerging PFAS as well as their toxicity and high persistence against most water treatment methods pose a serious environmental challenge. Photochemical processes offer feasible methods for PFAS decomposition due to their simplicity, operating in mild conditions, and high degree of efficacy. This paper identifies and compares mechanisms of photo-chemical/catalytic oxidation and reduction of different PFAS structures. The effects of adding different oxidative and reductive mediators - inorganic ions (e.g., persulfate and sulfite), organic solutes (e.g., aminopolycarboxylic acids), and photocatalysts - are comprehensively studied. Oxidative agents (e.g., SO4˙− and h+) and hydrated electrons (eaq−) are identified as the main active agents carrying out photo-oxidative and -reductive processes, respectively. PFAS are oxidatively degraded through one electron transfer to photo-induced oxidants followed by functional group detachment and chain shortening. On the other hand, cleavage of the C-F bond, functional group detachment followed by chain shortening, and center C-C or C-O bond scissions are proposed reductive pathways of PFAS decomposition upon reaction with eaq−. Moreover, the effects of key parameters on photodegradation of PFAS including operational parameters (i.e., pH, dissolved oxygen, and temperature), irradiation (i.e., wavelength and intensity), PFAS concentration and structure, and various water solutes (i.e., organic and inorganic matters) are evaluated in detail. In addition, the synergistic effects of combining other remediation processes, i.e., removal and degradation processes, with photochemical processes and benefits and challenges of such combinations are presented. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry","Image processing; Industrial chemicals; Industrial water treatment; Anthropogenic chemicals; Chain shortening; Commercial applications; Condition; Decomposition mechanism; Environmental challenges; Key factors; Photochemical process; Reductive decomposition; Water treatment methods; Dissolved oxygen; chemical compound; concentration (composition); decomposition; dissolved oxygen; photochemistry; photodegradation; photolysis; polymer; redox conditions; solute transport"

It also elaborates the properties of different media, characteristics of attached biomass, and their contributions to AGMBR performance. Conventional media, such as biological activated carbon and polymeric carriers, induce formation of aerobic, anoxic and/or anaerobic microenvironment, increase specific surface area or porous space for biomass retention, improve microbial activities, and enrich diverse microorganisms, thereby enhancing pollutants removal. Meanwhile, new media (i.e. biochar, bioaugmented carriers with selected strain/mixed cultures) do not only eliminate conventional pollutants (i.e. high concentration of nitrogen, etc.), but also effectively remove emerging pollutants (i.e. micropollutants, nonylphenol, adsorbable organic halogens, etc.) by forming thick and dense biofilm, creating anoxic/anaerobic microenvironments inside the media, enriching special functional microorganisms and increasing activity of microorganisms. Additionally, media can improve sludge characteristics (i.e. less extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products, larger floc size, better sludge settleability, etc.), alleviating membrane fouling. Future studies need to focus on the development and applications of more new functional media in removing wider spectrum of emerging pollutants and enhancing biogas generation, as well as scale-up of lab-scale AGMBRs to pilot or full-scale AGMBRs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Bioconversion; Bioreactors; Membrane fouling; Membranes; Microorganisms; Pollution; Reclamation; Anaerobics; Attached growth; Carrier; Emerging pollutants; Growth process; Medium; Membrane bioreactor system; Microenvironments; Nutrient pollutants; Property; Wastewater treatment; activated carbon; biogas; polymer; bioreactor; fouling; persistent organic pollutant; pollutant removal; wastewater treatment; aerobic bacterium; anaerobic bacterium; biofouling; biomass; concentration (parameter); nonhuman; particle size; physical chemistry; physical parameters; quorum quenching; Review; waste component removal; waste water management; artificial membrane; bioreactor; sewage; wastewater; water management; Bioreactors; Membranes, Artificial; Sewage; Waste Water; Water Purification"

Under this context, the straight activation of multiple notorious C-F bonds in poly- or perfluorine-containing compounds (PFCs), which are academically and practically readily accessible by fluorinations or fluorochemical industry, concomitant with further transformations has indeed become an emerging theme for the manufacture of usefully oligofluorinated or nonfluorinated cyclic skeletons. In this review, we highlighted the recent advances in this field by underpinning the cleaved C-F bond number during the defluorinative process, where the distinctive fluorine effects are the synthetic linchpins for tuning the reaction selectivity of PFCs and controlling reaction pathways for the anticipated annulation in a designed sense.

Most commonly, alkyl fluorides are prepared by the formation of C−F bonds (fluorination), and numerous strategies for nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical fluorination have been reported in recent years. Although strategies to access alkyl fluorides by C−C bond formation (monofluoroalkylation) are inherently convergent and complexity-generating, they have been studied less than methods based on fluorination.

Thermal treatment is the most common remediation approach for PFAS-contaminated solid wastes. Although various thermal treatment techniques have demonstrated the potential to destruct PFAS, the fate of PFAS, removal efficacy, potential emissions, and the formation of incomplete combustion products during thermal treatment are little known. This study provides a critical review on the behavior of PFAS based on different types of thermal treatment technologies with various PFAS-impacted environmental medias that include water, soil, sewage sludge, pure PFAS materials, and other PFAS-containing wastes. Different extents of PFAS thermal destruction are observed across various thermal treatment techniques and operating conditions. PFAS removal and destruction efficiencies rely heavily on PFAS structures, the complex combustion chemistry, the presence or absence of oxygen, temperature, and other operational conditions. This review also covers proposed PFAS thermal destruction mechanisms. Different thermal destruction mechanisms for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and other PFAS are reviewed and compared. The majority of studies about PFAS thermal destruction mechanisms were focused on a specific list of PFAS and based mostly on the pyrolysis treatment. The basic pathway for PFAS destruction during pyrolysis is hydrodefluorination, which could be largely influenced by the alkaline condition. Future field-scale research that involves the characterization of PFAS destruction products and incomplete combustion products is needed to address public concerns and better emission control.

Identifying the source responsible for a pollution hot spot is vital for assessing remediation measures, however, as there are many possible sources of environmental PFAS pollution, this can be challenging. Chemical fingerprinting has been proposed as an approach to identify contamination sources. Here, concentrations and profiles (relative distribution profiles) of routinely targeted PFAS in freshwater fish from eight sites in Norway, representing three different sources: (1) production of paper products, (2) the use of aqueous film forming foams (AFFF), and (3) long-range atmospheric transport, were investigated. The data were retrieved from published studies. Results showed that fingerprinting of PFAS in fish can be used to identify the dominant exposure source(s), and the profiles associated with the different sources were described in detail. Based on the results, the liver was concluded to be better suited for source tracking compared to muscle. PFAS fingerprints originating from AFFF were dominated by perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and other perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids (PFSA). Fingerprints originating from both long-range atmospheric transport and production of paper products were associated with high percentages of long chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA). However, there were differences between the two latter sources with respect to the ∑PFAS concentrations and ratios of specific PFCA pairs (PFUnDA/PFDA and PFTrDA/PFDoDA). Low ∑PFAS concentrations were detected in fish exposed mainly to PFAS via long-range atmospheric transport. In contrast, ∑PFAS concentrations were high and high percentages of PFOS were detected in fish exposed to pollution from production of paper products. The source-specific fingerprints described here can be used for source tracking.

However, short-chain PFASs re-main persistent, potentially toxic, and extremely mobile, posing potential threats to human health because of their widespread pollution and accumulation in the water cycle. This study systemati-cally summarized the removal effect, operation conditions, treating time, and removal mechanism of various low carbon treatment techniques for short-chain PFASs, involving adsorption, advanced oxidation, and other practices. By the comparison of applicability, pros, and cons, as well as bottle-necks and development trends, the most widely used and effective method was adsorption, which could eliminate short-chain PFASs with a broad range of concentrations and meet the low-carbon policy, although the adsorbent regeneration was undesirable. In addition, advanced oxidation techniques could degrade short-chain PFASs with low energy consumption but unsatisfied mineralization rates. Therefore, combined with the actual situation, it is urgent to enhance and upgrade the water treatment techniques to improve the treatment efficiency of short-chain PFASs, for providing a scientific basis for the effective treatment of PFASs pollution in water bodies globally. © 2022 by the authors.

The unique ultrastructures that support cell-cell interactions in the testis are the basal ES (ectoplas-mic specialization) and the apical ES. The basal ES is found between adjacent Sertoli cells near the basement membrane that also constitute the blood-testis barrier (BTB). The apical ES is restrictively expressed at the Sertoli-spermatid contact site in the apical (adluminal) compartment of the sem-iniferous epithelium. These ultrastructures are present in both rodent and human testes, but the majority of studies found in the literature were done in rodent testes. As such, our discussion herein, unless otherwise specified, is focused on studies in testes of adult rats. Studies have shown that the testicular cell-cell interactions crucial to support spermatogenesis are mediated through distinctive signaling proteins and pathways, most notably involving FAK, Akt1/2 and Cdc42 GTPase. Thus, manipulation of some of these signaling proteins, such as FAK, through the use of phosphomimetic mutants for overexpression in Sertoli cell epithelium in vitro or in the testis in vivo, making FAK either constitutively active or inactive, we can modify the outcome of spermatogenesis. For instance, using the toxicant-induced Sertoli cell or testis injury in rats as study models, we can either block or rescue toxicant-induced infertility through overexpression of p-FAK-Y397 or p-FAK-Y407 (and their mutants), including the use of specific activator(s) of the involved signaling proteins against pAkt1/2. These findings thus illustrate that a potential therapeutic approach can be developed to manage toxicant-induced male reproductive dysfunction. In this review, we critically evaluate these recent findings, highlighting the direction for future investigations by bringing the laboratory-based research through a translation path to clinical investigations. © 2022 by the authors.

Benefiting from the unique redox-active properties of MOFs, this review surveys literature update on their application for the removal of CECs. The underlaying electron transfer mechanism and strategies for incorporating redox-active sites into MOFs are comprehensively discussed. Different components of MOFs that are redox-active are further highlighted. This study elaborates the application of MOFs for Fenton-type and other advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for removing emerging contaminants. AOPs generate highly reactive strong oxidants like hydroxyl and sulfate radicals that are efficient for degrading emerging pollutants with high mineralization rates.

Perfluoroaromatic reagents are perhaps one of the most diverse and exciting tools with which to modify peptides and proteins, due principally to their nucleophilic substitution chemistry, high electron deficiency and the ability for their reactivity to be tuned towards specific nucleophiles. As discussed in this minireview, in recent years, perfluoroaromatic reagents have found applications as protecting groups or activating groups in peptide synthesis and as orthogonal handles for peptide modification. Furthermore, they have applications in chemoselective ‘tagging’, stapling and bioconjugation of peptides and proteins, as well as tuning of ‘drug-like’ properties. This review will also explore possible future applications of these reagents in biological chemistry. © 2021 The Authors.

The presence of strong carbon‑fluorine bonds in their backbone and their physicochemical properties offer them resistance and restrict them from breaking down into simple compounds in the environment. There are many challenges to be addressed in the detection and removal from the environment. In this comprehensive review, a Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework has been proposed to understand PFAS from the source of emission and their impacts on the environment. We reviewed the various detection methodologies for monitoring PFAS levels and analytical techniques for their quantification to know their environmental levels. The challenges and scope of various treatment technologies developed and implemented have also been critically discussed. The future perspectives of PFAS, including their source reduction and framing regulatory policies and the challenges faced when moving towards a sustainable future, are focused. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",

The occurrence of ARVDs in water bodies raises concern because many communities in Africa depend on rivers for water resources. Southern Africa is a potential hotspot regarding ARVD contamination due to relatively high therapeutic application and detection thereof in water bodies. Efavirenz and nevirapine are the most persistent in effluents and are prevalent in surface water based on environmental concentrations. Whereas the highest concentration of efavirenz reported in Kenya was 12.4 µg L–1, concentrations as high as 119 and 140 µg L–1 have been reported in Zambia and South Africa, respectively. Concentrations of ARVDs ranging from 670 to 34 000 ng L–1 (influents) and 540 to 34 000 ng L–1 (effluents) were determined in wastewater treatment plants in South Africa, compared with Europe, where reported concentrations range from less than limit of detection (LOD) to 32 ng L–1 (influents) and less than LOD to 22 ng L–1 (effluents).

Due to their enormous persistence and high mobility, these substances have led to global contamination of the environment and foodstuffs in recent decades. Some PFAS accumulate in humans and—because of their transfer into breast milk—especially in breastfed children. In the last two decades epidemiological studies have provided increasing evidence that effects in humans are also possible in the range of high background exposure. Given the current data situation, a reduced formation of vaccine antibodies is to be regarded as a critical effect in children. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) submitted a new PFAS assessment on 17 September 2020 deriving a tolerable weekly intake for the sum of four compounds. This assessment focused on the accumulation of the compounds during the breastfeeding period and possible effects on the formation of vaccine antibodies in the child. Even though the general PFAS exposure has significantly decreased over the last 30 years, currently approximately 20% of women in Germany are still exposed at such high levels that children breastfed for a long duration can reach the critical PFAS levels in blood derived by the EFSA. In this statement, the National Breastfeeding Committee addresses the balance of benefits and risks of breastfeeding with respect to the exposure of breastfed infants to PFAS. The committee comes to the following conclusions: a reduced formation of vaccine antibodies is to be regarded as undesirable in general. So far, however, there is no convincing scientific evidence that a comparatively high PFAS exposure has a clinical significance in the sense of a reduced effectiveness of vaccinations or an increased susceptibility to infections in children who have been breastfed for a long duration. The possible health risks mentioned are contrasted by numerous consistently observed positive effects of breastfeeding in the child and mother. Weighing up the possible risks of PFAS intake in the breastfed child against the proven benefits of breastfeeding, the National Breastfeeding Committee therefore sees no reason to deviate from the existing breastfeeding recommendation given the current data situation. This applies both to the general population and to people in regions with higher exposure to PFAS. Also, worldwide no scientific body has advised a restriction of breastfeeding to date, in the knowledge of the findings on perfluorinated compounds currently available. © 2021, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.","antibody; organic compound; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; breast feeding; disease predisposition; health hazard; human; immune response; Review; risk benefit analysis; vaccination"

During pregnancy, the complement system must be appropriately regulated to allow for immunologic tolerance to the developing fetus and placenta. Although some degree of complement activation can be seen in normal pregnancy, the fetus seems to be protected in part through the placental expression of complement regulatory proteins, which inhibit complement activation at different steps along the complement activation cascade. In women who develop preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome, there is a shift toward increased complement activation and decreased complement regulation. There is an increase in placental deposition of C5b-9, which is the terminal effector of classical, lectin, and alternative complement pathways. C5b-9 deposition stimulates trophoblasts to secrete soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, which sequesters vascular endothelial growth factor and placental growth factor. Pathogenic mutations or deletions in complement regulatory genes, which predispose to increased complement activation, have been detected in women with preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome. Before the disease, biomarkers of alternative complement pathway activation are increased; during active disease, biomarkers of terminal complement pathway activation are increased. Urinary excretion of C5b-9 is associated with preeclampsia with severe features and distinguishes it from other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Taken together, existing data link preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome with increased activation of the terminal complement pathway that, in some cases, may be influenced by genetic alterations in complement regulators. These findings suggest that the inhibition of the terminal complement pathway, possibly through C5 blockade, may be an effective strategy to treat preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome, but this strategy warrants further evaluation in clinical trials. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","C reactive protein; CD59 antigen; complement component C1q; complement component C3; complement component C3a; complement component C4b; complement component C4d; complement component C5a; complement component C5b; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement membrane attack complex; decay accelerating factor; DNA; eculizumab; fibrin; ficolin; mannose binding lectin; membrane cofactor protein; messenger RNA; protein tyrosine kinase; soluble fms like tyrosine kinase 1; unclassified drug; vasculotropin receptor 1; biological marker; complement; complement inhibitor; eculizumab; monoclonal antibody; placental growth factor; vasculotropin receptor 1; amniocentesis; antiangiogenic activity; apoptosis; blood vessel permeability; complement activation; complement alternative pathway; complement system; cytokine release; disease association; down regulation; enzyme inhibition; fetus death; gene deletion; gene mutation; genetic association; genetic screening; genetic variability; HELLP syndrome; heterozygosity; human; hypertension; MCP gene; nonhuman; oxygenation; pathophysiology; phenotype; placenta circulation; preeclampsia; pregnant woman; protein localization; proteinuria; Review; trophoblast; blood; female; genetics; HELLP syndrome; immunology; mutation; preeclampsia; pregnancy; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Biomarkers; Complement Activation; Complement Inactivating Agents; Complement System Proteins; Female; HELLP Syndrome; Humans; Mutation; Placenta Growth Factor; Pre-Eclampsia; Pregnancy; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1"

In this review, we focus on innate immune mechanisms of platelet activation, platelet interactions with innate immune cells, as well as the intersection of platelets and adaptive immunity. The immune potential of platelets is dependent in part on their megakaryocyte precursor providing them with the molecular composition to be first responders and immune sentinels in initiating and orchestrating coordinated pathogen immune responses. There is emerging evidence that extramedullary megakaryocytes may be immune differentiated compared with bone marrow megakaryocytes, but the physiological relevance of immunophenotypic differences are just beginning to be explored.

As these polymers are not easily degraded in our body, it is difficult to use them in applications that require antithrombotic properties, such as artificial blood vessels. The material used for medical applications should not only be stable in vivo, but it should also be inert to biomolecules such as proteins or cells. In this review, this property is defined as “bio-inert,” and previous studies in this field are summarized. Bio-inert materials are less recognized as foreign substances by proteins or cells in the living body, and they must be covered at interfaces designed with the concept of intermediate water (IW). On the basis of this concept, we present here the current understanding of bio-inertness and unusual blood compatibility found in fluoropolymers used in biomedical applications. IW is the water that interacts with materials with moderate strength and has been quantified by a variety of analytical methods and simulations. For example, by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, IW was defined as water frozen at around -40°C. To consider the role of the IW, quantification methods of the hydration state of polymers are also summarized. These investigations have been conducted independently because of the conflict between hydrophobic fluorine and bio-inert properties that require hydrophilicity. In recent years, not many materials have been developed that incorporate the good points of both aspects, and their properties have seldom been linked to the hydration state. This has been critically performed now. Furthermore, fluorine-containing polymers in medical use are reviewed. Finally, this review also describes the molecular design of the recently reported fluorine-containing bio-inert polymers for controlling their hydration state. Statement of significance: A material covered with a hydration layer known as intermediate water that interacts moderately with other objects is difficult to be recognized as a foreign substance and exhibits bio-inert properties. Fluoropolymers show high durability, but conflict with bio-inert characteristics requiring hydrophilicity as these research studies have been conducted independently. On the other hand, materials that combine the advantages of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic features have been developed recently. Here, we summarize the molecular architecture and analysis methods that control intermediate water and provide a guideline for designing novel fluorine-containing bio-inert materials. © 2021","Blood; Blood vessels; Differential scanning calorimetry; Fluorine; Fluorine containing polymers; Functional polymers; Heat resistance; Hydration; Hydrophilicity; Hydrophobicity; Proteins; Bio-inert property; Foreign substances; Hydration state; Inert materials; Inert polymers; Inert properties; Intermediate waters; Poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate); Property; Medical applications; acrylamide; amino acid; biomaterial; bovine serum albumin; collagen; ethylene; fibrinogen; fluorine; glass; hexafluoropropylene; hydrogel; nylon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyacrylonitrile; polyethylene; polyethylene terephthalate; polymer; polypropylene; polystyrene; polytetrafluoroethylene; polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinylidene fluoride; tetrafluoroethylene; unclassified drug; water; fluorine; analytic method; animal experiment; animal model; antithrombotic activity; apoptosis; Bacillus subtilis; bacterium adherence; biocompatibility; blood compatibility; complement activation; contact angle; crystal structure; crystallization; differential scanning calorimetry; elemental analysis; enthalpy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; gamma radiation; human; hydration; hydrogen bond; hydrophilicity; mesentery lymph node; molecular dynamics; molecular weight; nonhuman; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; quantitative analysis; rat; refraction index; Review; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; Streptococcus mutans; surface property; temperature; water immersion; X ray diffraction; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; zeta potential; differential scanning calorimetry; Biocompatible Materials; Calorimetry, Differential Scanning; Fluorine; Polymers; Water"

In wildlife, changes in the biotic and abiotic environment (e.g. salinity, temperature, reproductive stage, and health status) often lead to dynamic and responsive physiological changes that alter the prevalence and location of many proteins, including PFAS-related proteins. Therefore, we hypothesize that if key PFAS-related proteins are impacted as a result of environmentally induced as well as biologically programmed physiological changes (e.g. reproduction), then PFAS that associate with those proteins will also be impacted. Changes in tissue distribution across tissues of PFAS due to these dynamics may have implications for wildlife studies where these chemicals are measured in biological matrices (e.g., serum, feathers, eggs). For example, failure to account for factors contributing to PFAS variability in a tissue may result in exposure misclassification as measured concentrations may not reflect average exposure levels. The goal of this review is to share general information with the PFAS research community on what biotic and abiotic changes might be important to consider when designing and interpreting a biomonitoring or an ecotoxicity based wildlife study. This review will also draw on parallels from the epidemiological discipline to improve study design in wildlife research. Overall, understanding these connections between biotic and abiotic environments, dynamic protein levels, PFAS levels measured in wildlife, and epidemiology serves to strengthen study design and study interpretation and thus strengthen conclusions derived from wildlife studies for years to come. © 2021","Cell proliferation; Fatty acids; Physiology; Proteins; Tissue; Abiotic; Biotics; Fatty acid-binding proteins; Organic anions; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Protein expressions; Reproductive health; Reproductive stage; Serum proteins; Study design; Animals; ABC transporter; albumin; fatty acid binding protein; lipid; lipoprotein; organic anion transporter; organofluorine derivative; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl acid; perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance; phospholipid; plasma protein; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; abiotic factor; biomonitoring; biotic factor; gene expression; persistent organic pollutant; physiological response; protein; toxicity; wildlife management; binding affinity; bioaccumulation; biological monitoring; body constitution; diet; diseases; ecotoxicity; environmental change; environmental exposure; excretion; health status; human; nonhuman; physiology; pregnancy; protein binding; protein expression; protein localization; reproduction; Review; salinity; seasonal variation; temperature; tissue distribution; toxicokinetics; wildlife; animal; wild animal; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Animals, Wild; Biological Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Reproduction"

Contaminants like heavy metals and dyes have been a major source of environmental concern. Research studies involving the use of HAp as adsorbents for the adsorptive treatment of heavy metal- and dye-contaminated wastewater have become increasingly popular due to its eco-friendliness, easy synthesis, unique adsorption properties etc. Various methods are available for the synthesis of HAp and its composites with some of these methods used in combination with other methods to obtain more efficient HAp-based adsorbents. In this work, the adsorptive removal of heavy metals and dyes by HAp and its composites was extensively reviewed as well as the parametric effects of process factors like contact time, solution pH, temperature, solute concentration etc on the adsorption process. Kinetic, thermodynamic, and isotherm models for elucidating the adsorption process were also considered.

A minority of flat feet can hurt and limit gait. There is no optimal strategy, nor consensus, for using foot orthoses (FOs) to treat paediatric flat feet. Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of foot orthoses for treating paediatric flat feet. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to 01 September 2021, and two clinical trials registers on 07 August 2020. Selection criteria: We identified all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of FOs as an intervention for paediatric flat feet. The outcomes included in this review were pain, function, quality of life, treatment success, and adverse events. Intended comparisons were: any FOs versus sham, any FOs versus shoes, customised FOs (CFOs) versus prefabricated FOs (PFOs). Data collection and analysis: We followed standard methods recommended by Cochrane. Main results: We included 16 trials with 1058 children, aged 11 months to 19 years, with flexible flat feet. Distinct flat foot presentations included asymptomatic, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), symptomatic and developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD). The trial interventions were FOs, footwear, foot and rehabilitative exercises, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Due to heterogeneity, we did not pool the data. Most trials had potential for selection, performance, detection, and selective reporting bias. No trial blinded participants. We present the results separately for asymptomatic (healthy children) and symptomatic (children with JIA) flat feet. The certainty of evidence was very low to low, downgraded for bias, imprecision, and indirectness. Three comparisons were evaluated across trials: CFO versus shoes; PFO versus shoes; CFO versus PFO. Asymptomatic flat feet. 1. CFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 106 participants): low-quality evidence showed that CFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10-point visual analogue scale (VAS)) at one year (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.07); absolute decrease (11.8%, 95% CI 4.7% fewer to 15.8% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19); absolute effect (3.4% more, 95% CI 4.1% fewer to 13.1% more). 2. PFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 106 participants): low to very-low quality evidence showed that PFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10-point VAS) at one year (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.16); absolute effect (4.7% fewer, 95% CI 18.9% fewer to 12.6% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23). 3. CFOs versus PFOs (1 trial, 108 participants): low-quality evidence found no difference in the proportion without pain at one year (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18); absolute effect (7.4% fewer, 95% CI 22.2% fewer to 11.1% more); or on withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.12). Function and quality of life (QoL) were not assessed. Symptomatic (JIA) flat feet. 1. CFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 28 participants, 3-month follow-up): very low-quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain (0 to 10 scale, 0 no pain) between groups (MD -1.5, 95% CI -2.78 to -0.22). Low-quality evidence showed improvements in function with CFOs (Foot Function Index - FFI disability, 0 to 100, 0 best function; MD -18.55, 95% CI -34.42 to -2.68), child-rated QoL (PedsQL, 0 to 100, 100 best quality; MD 12.1, 95% CI -1.6 to 25.8) and parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 9, 95% CI -4.1 to 22.1) and little or no difference between groups in treatment success (timed walking; MD -1.33 seconds, 95% CI -2.77 to 0.11), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.94); absolute difference (9.7% fewer, 20.5 % fewer to 44.8% more). 2. PFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 25 participants, 3-month follow-up): very low-quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain between groups (MD 0.02, 95% CI -1.94 to 1.98). Low-quality evidence showed no difference between groups in function (FFI-disability MD -4.17, 95% CI -24.4 to 16.06), child-rated QoL (PedsQL MD -3.84, 95% CI -19 to 11.33), or parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD -0.64, 95% CI -13.22 to 11.94). 3. CFOs versus PFsO (2 trials, 87 participants): low-quality evidence showed little or no difference between groups in pain (0 to scale, 0 no pain) at 3 months (MD -1.48, 95% CI -3.23 to 0.26), function (FFI-disability MD -7.28, 95% CI -15.47 to 0.92), child-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 8.6, 95% CI -3.9 to 21.2), or parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 2.9, 95% CI -11 to 16.8). Authors' conclusions: Low to very low-certainty evidence shows that the effect of CFOs (high cost) or PFOs (low cost) versus shoes, and CFOs versus PFOs on pain, function and HRQoL is uncertain. This is pertinent for clinical practice, given the economic disparity between CFOs and PFOs. FOs may improve pain and function, versus shoes in children with JIA, with minimal delineation between costly CFOs and generic PFOs. This review updates that from 2010, confirming that in the absence of pain, the use of high-cost CFOs for healthy children with flexible flat feet has no supporting evidence, and draws very limited conclusions about FOs for treating paediatric flat feet. The availability of normative and prospective foot development data, dismisses most flat foot concerns, and negates continued attention to this topic. Attention should be re-directed to relevant paediatric foot conditions, which cause pain, limit function, or reduce quality of life. The agenda for researching asymptomatic flat feet in healthy children must be relegated to history, and replaced by a targeted research rationale, addressing children with indisputable foot pathology from discrete diagnoses, namely JIA, cerebral palsy, congenital talipes equino varus, trisomy 21 and Charcot Marie Tooth. Whether research resources should continue to be wasted on studying flat feet in healthy children that do not hurt, is questionable. Future updates of this review will address only relevant paediatric foot conditions. Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.

This review critically examines the strategies to generate highly reactive high-valent iron intermediates, FeVO43– (FeV) and FeIVO44– or FeIVO32– (FeIV) species, from FeVIO42–, for the treatment of polluted water with greater efficiency. Approaches to produce FeV and FeIV species from FeVIO42– include additions of acid (e.g., HCl), metal ions (e.g., Fe(III)), and reductants (R). Details on applying various inorganic reductants (R) to generate FeV and FeIV from FeVIO42– via initial single electron-transfer (SET) and oxygen-atom transfer (OAT) to oxidize recalcitrant pollutants are presented. The common constituents of urine (e.g., carbonate, ammonia, and creatinine) and different solids (e.g., silica and hydrochar) were found to accelerate the oxidation of pharmaceuticals by FeVIO42–, with potential mechanisms provided. The challenges of providing direct evidence of the formation of FeV/FeIV species are discussed. Kinetic modeling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide opportunities to distinguish between the two intermediates (i.e., FeIV and FeV) in order to enhance oxidation reactions utilizing FeVIO42–.

Existing regulatory systems have proven to be inadequate for assessing and managing the tens of thousands of chemicals in commerce. A different approach is urgently needed to minimize ongoing production, use, and exposures to hazardous chemicals. The premise of the essential-use approach is that chemicals of concern should be used only in cases in which their function in specific products is necessary for health, safety, or the functioning of society and when feasible alternatives are unavailable. To optimize the essential-use approach for broader implementation in the United States and Canada, we recommend that governments and businesses (1) identify chemicals of concern for essentiality assessments based on a broad range of hazard traits, going beyond toxicity; (2) expedite decision-making by avoiding unnecessary assessments and strategically asking up to three questions to determine whether the use of the chemical in the product is essential; (3) apply the essential-use approach as early as possible in the process of developing and assessing chemicals; and (4) engage diverse experts in identifying chemical uses and functions, assessing alternatives, and making essentiality determinations and share such information broadly.

This review outlines the research progress of ionization to improve the gas separation performance of typical microporous polymers (e.g., polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIM), perfluorinated polymers, microporous polyimides, etc.) and summarizes the different ionization methods, including carboxylation, sulfonation, quaternization, and other ionization processes. Additionally, the review also explores the research progress of ionization to regulate the processability, microporosity, and gas separation properties of microporous polymers. Specifically, ionization can effectively tailor the microporosity, improve the solubility coefficients of gas molecules, especially CO2, and enhance gas selectivities.

Their resistance to degradation, however, means that PFAS are ubiquitous in the environment and bioaccumulate. PFAS exposure has also been linked to a variety of adverse health effects. Occupational PFAS exposure is of particular concern as research on PFAS exposure in worker populations has historically been limited and generally restricted to fluorochemical plant workers involved in PFAS production. Methods: A comprehensive review of peer-reviewed scientific literature was conducted to investigate which worker populations may experience occupational exposure to PFAS. Serum PFAS levels reported in various occupations were analyzed and compared to serum PFAS levels published on the general public exposed to PFAS-contaminated drinking water and the study population of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Results: Our analysis indicates that professional ski waxers and firefighters may be exposed to several different PFAS at levels often similar to or higher than levels among fluorochemical plant workers and individuals in communities with PFAS-contaminated drinking water, and higher than levels in the general public. PFAS serum level data on other occupations were largely absent. Conclusions: Results highlight a need for additional research on occupational PFAS exposures and concomitant environmental exposures in these populations. Research on exposure levels in occupations and industries known or suspected to utilize PFAS is critically needed to foster informed recommendations for exposure mitigation measures to protect workers from adverse health effects of PFAS exposure. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

In the USA, the health sector accounts for 8.5% of total GHG emissions. The primary objective of this systematic review was to critically analyse the carbon emissions data from GI endoscopic activity. Design: The GI endoscopy carbon cycle was evaluated at preprocedural, intraprocedural and postprocedural levels. We performed a systematic literature search of articles published on these issues until 30 June 2022 and discussed these available data on endoscopy unit GHG carbon cycle, barriers to reduce GHG emissions and potential solutions. The inclusion criteria were any full-text articles (observational, clinical trials, brief communications, case series and editorials) reporting waste generation from GI endoscopy. Abstracts, news articles and conference proceedings were excluded. Results: Our search yielded 393 records in PubMed, 1708 in Embase and 24 in Google Scholar. After application of inclusion and exclusion factors, we focused on 9 fulllength articles in detail, only 3 of them were cross-sectional studies (all from the USA), the others reviews or position statements. Therefore, the quality of the studies could not be assessed due to heterogeneity in definitions and amount of emissions. Conclusions: Recognition of carbon emissions generated by GI endoscopy activity is critical. Although multiple limitations exists for quantification of these emission, there is an urgent need for collecting proper data as well as examining novel methods for reduction of these emissions for a sustainable endoscopic practices in the future. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

This has been acknowledged in the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, which proposes to regulate the release of chemicals to the environment and names specific indicators focusing on pesticides, nutrients and plastic waste. We fully welcome the inclusion of these substances but would like to further emphasize that in order to protect biodiversity from hazardous chemicals, the scope of Target 7 should feature a wider range of pollutants that can contribute to biodiversity loss. We propose the inclusion of non-agricultural biocides, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), toxic metal(loid)s, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Furthermore, data on emerging pollutants (e.g., rare earth elements, toxic and persistent industrial chemicals, liquid crystal monomers, pharmaceuticals, personal care products) need to be regularly reviewed with the aim to integrate additional pollutants to Target 7 in the case of biodiversity risk. We suggest to amend Target 7 to postulate the aim for the overall reduction of chemical production and emissions, as well as the addition of the aforementioned substance groups of high concern to biodiversity for integration in the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. We further elaborate on different strategies for the reduction of emissions of hazardous chemicals through chemical simplification and grouping, reduction of chemicals with non-essential use, and innovative synthesis strategies (e.g., “benign-by-design”). In this context, the full life cycle of chemicals (i.e., production, use, and end of life) needs to be considered. Lastly, we propose to set up transparent data inventories, in cooperation with the industry, to inform about the production, transport and emissions of chemicals, which can serve as a basis for indicators related to monitoring the progress towards achieving the goals set under Target 7. © 2023 RSC.",

Because of their unique structural characteristics and diverse functional groups, COFs have been used in various application fields, such as adsorption, catalysis, separation, ion conduction, and energy storage. Among COFs, the fluorine-containing COFs (fCOFs) have been developed for special applications by virtue of special physical and chemical properties resulting from fluorine element, which is a nonmetallic halogen element and possesses strong electronegativity. In the organic chemistry field, introducing fluorine into chemicals enables those chemicals to exhibit many interesting properties, and fluorine chemistry increasingly plays an important role in the history of chemical development. The introduction of fluorine in COFs can enhance the crystallinity, porosity, and stability of COFs, making COFs having superior performances and some new applications. In this review, the synthesis and application of fCOFs are systematically summarized. The application involves photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide, photocatalytic water splitting, electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, adsorption for different substances (H2, pesticides, per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, bisphenols, and positively charged organic dye molecules), oil−water separation, energy storage (e.g., zinc-ion batteries, lithium−sulfur batteries), and proton conduction.

PFOA in soil can enter plants, affect plant growth and threaten food safety. Therefore, understanding the plant utilization and phytotoxicity of PFOA is conducive to assessing the environmental risk of soil contaminated with PFOA. This review analyzed recent studies about the uptake and effects of PFOA on terrestrial plants from the aspects of absorption, transport, distribution, phytotoxicity, and the underlying mechanism. Based on current research, PFOA was predominantly taken by plant roots and showed adverse effects on plants by affecting the antioxidant system and metabolic process. Research in field or higher terrestrial plants is still very scarce.

Most of these compounds have been detected in significant amounts in different water matrices (drinking, sewage, ground water). Several conventional and advanced oxidation processes have been used for the removal of ECs. However, these processes are limited by incomplete degradation and high energy input, and some technologies such as adsorption and membrane processes involve only phase transfer of pollutants. According to the USEPA, ECs in the range from ng L−1 to mg L−1 can impose adverse environmental and health effects. This review details the application of nonthermal plasma (NTP) produced by pulsed electrical discharge which has been widely investigated for the abatement of various emerging contaminants in water and wastewater. Since NTP may not be economically suitable as a stand-alone unit for wastewater because of energy costs and the formation of reaction byproducts this review will focus on the integration of NTP in water treatment schemes. In general, single unit water treatment techniques are inadequate for the removal of these recalcitrant compounds. Treatment technologies that combine various advanced oxidation/reduction processes such as NTP with other conventional methods such as biological treatment may have potential for the complete removal of such pollutants. Pre-treatment and post-treatment NTP units can be added based on economic viability and treatment effectiveness.

This review discusses the interspecies and intra-species communications between different microbial groups with their respective environments. Moreover, this review also envisages the efforts for designing the next level of microbiome-host engineering concept (MHEC). The focus of the review also extended toward using omics and metabolic network analysis-based tools for effective microbiome engineering.

Fluoropolymers possess a unique combination of properties and unmatched functional performance critical to the products and manufacturing processes they enable and are irreplaceable in many uses. Fluoropolymers have documented safety profiles; are thermally, biologically, and chemically stable, negligibly soluble in water, nonmobile, nonbioavailable, nonbioaccumulative, and nontoxic. Although fluoropolymers fit the PFAS structural definition, they have very different physical, chemical, environmental, and toxicological properties when compared with other PFAS. This study describes the composition, uses, performance properties, and functionalities of 14 fluoropolymers, including fluoroplastics and fluoroelastomers, and presents data to demonstrate that they satisfy the widely accepted polymer hazard assessment criteria to be considered polymers of low concern (PLC). The PLC criteria include physicochemical properties, such as molecular weight, which determine bioavailability and warn of potential hazard. Fluoropolymers are insoluble (e.g., water, octanol) solids too large to migrate into the cell membrane making them nonbioavailable, and therefore, of low concern from a human and environmental health standpoint. Further, the study results demonstrate that fluoropolymers are a distinct and different group of PFAS and should not be grouped with other PFAS for hazard assessment or regulatory purposes. When combined with an earlier publication by Henry et al., this study demonstrates that commercial fluoropolymers are available from the seven participating companies that meet the criteria to be considered PLC, which represent approximately 96% of the global commercial fluoropolymer market.

The RSC reflects the proportion of the total daily intake of a chemical that can be derived from water when all other sources of exposure (e.g., food, air) are considered. This term is applied by the USEPA and state regulatory agencies when deriving ambient water quality criteria, maximum contaminant level goals, and drinking water health advisories for noncarcinogenic and threshold carcinogenic compounds. The value assigned to the RSC term affects the calculated criteria directly, with the allowable concentration in water decreasing with a decreasing RSC. A default RSC value of 20%—applied by regulatory entities in the USA for more than 40 years—assumes that 80% of an individual's exposure to a chemical's reference dose is from nonwater sources. Although the RSC is a chemical-specific parameter, there are few instances where a value other than the default of 20% has been approved and used. In 2000, USEPA outlined the process for developing chemical-specific RSC values, yet primary use of the default RSC value has continued since then. This article reviews USEPA's methodology for deriving chemical-specific RSC values and provides a case example using perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) to explore how the USEPA and state regulatory agencies are applying USEPA's guidance. The case study highlights inconsistent derivation of the RSC term, rooted in limitations in the current methodology. We suggest additional clarification of and more thoughtful use of the available data that may not meet USEPA's current adequacy requirements. We also recommend that the USEPA discuss recommendations for using biomonitoring data to set RSCs. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2022;00:1–8. © 2022 SETAC. © 2022 SETAC.",

In the present contribution, the current knowledge of PFAS contamination was systematically reviewed in order to provide with the knowledge gaps and main sources of contamination, as well as critically evaluate estimated dietary intake and relative risk values of the consulted studies. Legacy PFASs remain the most abundant despite their production restrictions. Edible species from freshwater bodies exhibit higher PFAS concentrations than marine species, probably due to low hydrodynamics and dilution in lentic ecosystems. Studies in food products from multiple sources, including aquatic, livestock, and agricultural, agree that the proximity to factories and fluorochemical industries rendered significantly higher and potentially hazardous PFAS contamination.

Sampling methods have significant influences on the identification of chemical compositions and source contributions, with Quartz and Teflon filters being the most widely used. Receptor models are commonly adopted for identifying the sources of PM2.5, such as positive matrix factorization, chemical mass balance, principal component analysis, and UNMIX models, which have their respective advantages and limitations that determine their applications.

The flavoring value is related to the lactones’ ring size and chain length, which blend in varying concentrations to produce different stone-fruit flavors. The nature-identical and enantiomeric pure (+)-lactones are only produced through whole-cell biotransformation of yeast. The industrially important γ-decalactone and δ-decalactone are produced by a four-step aerobic-oxidation of ricinoleic acid (RA) following the lactonization mechanism. Recently, metabolic engineering strategies have opened up new possibilities for increasing productivity. Another strategy for increasing yield is to immobilize the RA and remove lactones from the broth regularly.

These synthetic chemicals are in widespread use for consumer products, firefighting foams, and industrial applications. They have been detected all over the globe, including at remote locations distant from any possible point sources. One mechanism for long-range transport of PFAS is through sorption to aerosol particles in the atmosphere. PFAS can be transferred from the sea surface to sea spray aerosol particles through wave breaking and bubble bursting, and PFAS emitted to the atmosphere in the gas phase can sorb to particulate matter through gas-particle partitioning. Here we present a comprehensive review of global measurements of PFAS on ambient particulate matter dating back to the first reports from the early 2000s. We summarize findings for the historically important C8 species, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), including detection of isomers and size-segregated measurements, as well as studies of newer and emerging PFAS. We conclude that long-term monitoring of PFAS on particulate matter should be expanded to include more measurement sites in under-sampled regions of the world and that further non-targeted work to identify novel PFAS structures is needed as PFAS manufacturing and regulations continue to evolve. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry","Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; Consumer products; Isomers; Organic pollutants; Surface waters; Aerosol particles; Atmospheric aerosol particles; Firefighting foams; Human health; Long range transport; Particulate Matter; Point-sources; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Remote location; Synthetic chemicals; Particles (particulate matter)"

This disease is classified broadly by tissue, organ, and system; different cancer types and subtypes require different treatments. Drug bioavailability, selectivity, and high dosage, as well as extended treatment, are significantly associated with the development of resistance – a complex problem in cancer therapy. It is expected that the combination of anticancer drugs and drug delivery systems, using polymers to increase the access of such agents to their site of action, will improve the efficacy of therapy. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) is a polymer used as a co-delivery system for anticancer drugs and gene therapy. PEI is also useful for other purposes, such as transfection and bio-adsorbent agents. In co-delivery, PEI can promote drug internalization. However, PEI with a high molecular weight is linked to higher cytotoxicity, thus requiring further evaluation of clinical safety. This review focuses on the utilization of PEI as a co-delivery system for anticancer therapy, as well as its potential to overcome resistance, particularly in the treatment of specific subtypes (eg, breast cancer).

Literature reports that they are persistent and may travel considerable distances in all environmental compartments, such as water, sediment, air, and soil owing to their chemical and thermal stability. However, their transport with co-existing contaminants and their potential as vectors for various chemical and biological contaminants has been overlooked. In this sense, the present note addresses the role of PFCs as vectors, making this review one of its kind. This graphical review discusses the ability of PFCs to interact with different matrices, such as heavy metals, organic matter, and bacterial cell membranes via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, and aggregation and micelle formation, allowing them to act as vectors for various chemical and biological contaminants. This PFC-mediated transport can alter the tendency of both -PFCs and the contaminant to persist, bioaccumulate, and co-transport between and within disparate environmental matrices, as well as their interfaces. Further, this joint toxicity could potentially have elevated eco-toxicological impacts, including altered cell membrane permeability and increased cell uptake, which still need to be explored, thereby demonstrating the need for future investigations in this regard. © 2022 The Authors",

Allergen molecular characterization, cross-reactivity/co-sensitization phenomena, the impact of food processing and digestibility, and the methods currently available for the Rosaceae detection/quantification in foods are also described. Rosaceae allergy has a major impact in context to pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS) and lipid transfer protein (LTP) allergies, being greatly influenced by geography, environment, and presence of cofactors. Peach, apple, and almond allergies are probably the ones most affecting the quality of life of the allergic-patients, although allergies to other Rosaceae fruits cannot be overlooked. From patients’ perspective, self-allergy management and an efficient avoidance of multiple fruits are often difficult to achieve, which might raise the risk for cross-reactivity and co-sensitization phenomena and increase the severity of the induced allergic responses with time.

Although partially or not yet regulated or monitored, there is growing research interest in these EPs among the scientific community because of their bioaccumulation, persistence, and adverse effects. Among these, endocrine disruptors, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals can have harmful impacts on human health and the ecosystem. Conventional wastewater treatment technologies are not effective in removing these contaminants, allowing them to be released into the receiving environment. In order to improve the understanding of emerging pollutants, this review discusses the source, occurrence, and impacts of bisphenol A, atrazine, amoxicillin, and paracetamol as model molecules of emerging environmental pollutants, an issue that remains underrepresented in Morocco. Then, treatment methods for EPs are reviewed, including adsorption, advanced oxidation processes, biodegradation, and hybrid treatment. It is proposed that adsorption and photocatalysis can be used as simple, effective, and environmentally friendly technologies for their removal. Thus, we summarize some of the adsorbent and photocatalyst materials applied in recent work to control these pollutants.

Although the TMF has been recognized as the most reliable tool for assessing the biomagnification of organic contaminants, peer-reviewed studies reporting TMFs for PFAS are few and with limited geographical distribution. We found 25 published studies of the biomagnification of 35 specific PFAS, for which the TMF was generated through linear regression of individual log-PFAS concentration and the δ15N-based trophic position of each organism in the food webs. Studies were concentrated mainly in China, North America, and Europe, and the most investigated compound was perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), which was frequently shown to be biomagnified in the food web (TMFs ranging from 0.8 to 20). Other long-chain carboxylates displayed substantial variation in trophic magnification. Observed differences in the TMF were associated with length of the food web, geographic location, sampling methodologies, tissue analyzed, and distance from known direct PFAS inputs. In addition to biomagnification of legacy PFAS, precursor substances were observed to bioaccumulate in the food web, which suggests they may biotransform to more persistent PFAS compounds in upper trophic levels. This review discusses the variability of environmental characteristics driving PFAS biomagnification in natural ecosystems and highlights the different approaches used by each study, which can make comparisons among studies challenging.

The available literature up to April 2021 was reviewed and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) of PFAS assessed. A total of 39 studies reporting data on 20 PFAS were included in the systematic review. Of these, 20 studies with data on 19 compounds were included in the meta-analysis. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA v3.0) was used for quantitative, statistical analyses with random effects models. A curvilinear relationship was found with short and long chains of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) exhibiting higher TTE than compounds with intermediate chain length. Among the less well studied PFAS, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), 6:2 fluorotelomersulfonic acid (6:2 FTS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) stood out the most with a high TEEs. The dependence of TTEs on chain length and functional group is clearly shown in this first meta-analysis on PFAS transfer across the human placenta.

Recently, emerging contamination of PFCs is increasing concerns among the environmental quality experts globally due to their toxicity, detrimental effect, persistent and hard to biodegrade in the environment. The mixture of the aqueous solution containing hazardous PFCs has led to serious water contamination into our main water sources and potentially brings tremendously adverse effects, risk of diseases and disorders towards an abiotic and biotic ecosystem that was specifically threatening the living organisms’ health such as plant, animal and human. The elimination of PFCs pollutants is essential and has been crucial to demand attention to conserve pure, clean, and safe water resources. Herein, the feasibility of remediating PFCs from polluted aqueous solution by using various types of functional hybrid adsorbents based on natural polymers through a superior adsorptive mechanism has been reported in detail in this review paper. Particularly, the use of natural and renewable polymeric material on the fabrication of natural polymer-based adsorbents has been owing to their peculiar characteristics such as biodegradability, economic viability, the potential to reuse, and comprised of abundantly functional groups that can encourage and empower the elimination process of PFCs. The adsorption behaviour on several classes of PFCs onto different types of hybrid adsorbents was summarized, and various possible interactions mechanism like electrostatic attraction, ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and hydrogen bonding were fully reviewed. Moreover, the adsorption performance removal on PFCs between single-based adsorbent and multiple-based adsorbents was systematically compared and described to determine the execution removal capabilities for each adsorbent.

Although effective water treatment technologies exist for physical removal of many PFAS from water (e.g., activated carbon and ion-exchange resin), a PFAS-concentrated waste stream is generated as an end product that can potentially reintroduce PFAS back into the environment. Thus, there is an increased interest in developing destructive technologies to decompose and mineralize PFAS directly in water or in these waste streams. High energy electron beam (e-beam) accelerators have been used for water treatment to degrade a wide range of recalcitrant contaminants, including PFAS, since the 1960s. However, large-scale applications of e-beam for water treatment are restricted due to its high energy consumption and inability to treat large flow rates. Considering there are very few available technologies for destructive removal of PFAS, this study provides a critical review on the treatment of PFAS by direct irradiation of contaminated water by e-beam from an energy consumption point of view. To date, very limited studies have been conducted to investigate the success of this technology to treat PFAS. Results from the limited studies were not directly comparable due to the variation in operating conditions and water quality parameters used in the studies. Here, for the first time, we develop and apply the concept of electrical energy per order (EE/O) to assess the performance of e-beam for PFAS treatment. Results show that EE/O is a better performance parameter than the G value of e-beam for interstudy comparisons and to evaluate the effects of water quality and operating parameters on e-beam performance. We additionally developed a kinetic scheme to predict the performance of e-beam to treat PFAS and revealed that the competition between species to react with aqueous electrons is the determinant factor influencing PFAS degradation efficiency. Comparison of EE/O values of e-beam (range: 31−176 kWh m−3 order −1) with other destructive technologies (range: 5−9595 kWh m−3 order −1) suggest that e-beam, for PFAS treatment, is a promising approach under favorable conditions. This review further elucidates the feasibility and limitations of e-beam technology that could be improved upon to potentially make e-beam viable for large-scale water treatment applications. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",

PFAS have numerous applications in the industrial and commercial fields. They have become abundant in the environment and have been detected in the blood of humans and animals. PFAS exposure likely increases the risk of certain diseases. In recent years, there has been a steep rise in related primary and secondary articles. Objectives: We aim to collate narrative and systematic reviews including both qualitative and quantitative synthesis on biological, environmental, or medical aspects of PFAS exposure and burdens, and to create an evidence review map to fulfil three main objectives. 1) Mappingto reveal what evidence on PFAS has been systematically reviewed and where synthesis may be needed. 2) Bibliometrics: to characterise the interdisciplinarity, independence and connectedness of the reviews. 3) Critical appraisal: to assess the included reviews for the reliability of conclusions and methodological transparency. This overview of reviews will inform future research and policy making. Search and study eligibility: We will perform a systematic search on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and the ‘grey literature’. To be included in the map, a study must be a review from the systematic review family and focus on at least one of predefined 31 PFAS. We will limit inclusions to peer-reviewed publications, pre-prints, and theses without any language restrictions. At least two authors will scan title, abstract and keywords, followed by full-text screening of included reviews. Critical appraisal of reviews and synthesis methods: We will assess each review of the systematic review family referencing the AMSTAR2 checklist. We will collect information on conflict-of-interest statements, funding sources and availability of raw data and analysis code. We will extract relevant data from full texts and bibliographic records, conduct bibliometric analyses, and display findings as tables, figures and a narrative synopsis. © 2021 The Authors","Abstracting; Diagnosis; Organic chemicals; Anthropogenic organic chemicals; Bibliometrics analysis; Eco-toxicology; Map analysis; PFOA; PFOS; Systematic Review; ‘overview of review’; ‘systematic review’; ‘umbrella review’; Animals"

Several studies on the occurrence of PFASs in various food types have been conducted, including the assessment of dietary exposure. The most important sources were fish, meat, eggs, fruits, and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables recently showed relatively high levels of PFASs, and have become a more significant source of PFASs than meat.

Here, we review the toxic effects of PFASs encountered by various plants from physiological, biochemical and molecular perspectives. The exposure routes and bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites are also summarized. The bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites varied between ng/g and μg/g levels. The 50% inhibition concentration of PFASs for plant growth is often several orders of magnitude higher than the environmentally relevant concentrations (ERCs). ERCs of PFASs rarely lead to obvious phenotypic/physiological damages in plants, but markedly perturb some biological activities at biochemical and molecular scales. PFAS exposure induces the over-generated reactive oxygen species and further damages plant cell structure and organelle functions. A number of biochemical activities in plant cells are perturbed, such as photosynthesis, gene expression, protein synthesis, carbon and nitrogen metabolisms. To restore the desire states of cells exposed to PFASs, plants initiate several detoxifying mechanisms, including enzymatic antioxidants, non-enzymatic antioxidants, metallothionein genes and metabolic reprogramming.

Hence, the efficacious removal of emerging pollutants, like pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, beta blockers and analgesics, from wastewater has recently been a major area of concern for the researchers, since these biorefractory compounds can bioaccumulate in living beings and can also transform into other toxic compounds in the natural environment. Since pharmaceuticals are not efficiently removed through conventional wastewater treatment technologies; hence, trace concentrations of these can be found in the treated effluent. Thus, the development of reliable and efficient treatment technologies for the removal of pharmaceuticals is imperative. Electrocoagulation (EC) can treat these compounds effectively. In this review, the application of EC for the removal of pharmaceuticals, critical parameters that influence the treatment efficiency, comparison of EC with chemical coagulation and the economics pertaining to EC have been discussed.

The potential roles of these microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs in oral cancer development, with their attendant involvement in various cellular processes including proliferation, invasion, migration, epithelial–mesenchymal transition and metastasis is gaining credence. An interaction network of HOX-embedded non-coding RNAs was constructed to identify the RNA interaction landscape using the arena-Idb platform and visualized using Cytoscape. The miR-10a was shown to interact with HOXA1, miR-10b with HOXD10, miR-196a1 with HOXA5, HOXA7, HOXB8, HOXC8, HOXD8, and miR-196a2 with HOXA5. The lncRNAs, HOTAIR interacted with HOXC11, HOTAIRM1 with HOXA1 and HOXA4, HOTTIP with HOXA13, HOXA-AS2 with HOXA3, HOXA11-AS with HOXA11 and HOXD-AS1 with HOXB8. Changes in the HOX cluster-embedded non-coding RNAs have implications for prognosis and overall disease survival. Our review aims to analyze the functional significance and clinical relevance of non-coding RNAs within the HOX cluster in the context of oral carcinogenesis. Elucidating these interactions between the non-coding RNAs and HOX genes in oral cancer development and progression could pave the way for the identification of reliable biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

While considering pollutant removal, both techniques have their own merits and demerits. Microalgal-based methods have been dominantly used as a biological method for pollutant removal. The main limitations of microalgal methods are capacity, scale, dependence on variables of environment and duration of the process. Biopolymers on the other hand are naturally produced, abundant in nature, environmentally safe and biocompatible with cells and many times biodegradable. Algal immobilization in biopolymers has promoted the reuse of cells for further treatment and protected cells from toxic environment monitoring and controlling the external factors like pH, temperature and salinity can promote the removal process while working with the mentioned technologies. In this review, a mechanistic view of both these techniques along with integrated approaches emphasizing on their loopholes and possibilities of improvement in these techniques is represented. In addition to these, the review also discusses the post-treatment effect on algal cells which are specifically dependent on pollutant type and their concentration. All these insights will aid in developing integrated solutions to improve removal efficiencies in an environmentally safe and cost-effective manner. Novelty statement The main objective of this review is to thoroughly understand the role of micro-algal cells and synthetic adsorbents individually as well as their integrative effect in the removal of pollutants from wastewater. Many reviews have been published containing information related to either removal mechanism by algae or synthetic adsorbents. While in this review we have discussed the agents, algae and synthetic adsorbents along with their limitations and explained how these limitations can be overcome with the integration of both the moieties together in process of immobilization. We have covered both the analytical and mechanistic parts of these technologies. Along with this, the post-treatment effects on algae have been discussed which can give us a critical understanding of algal response to pollutants and by-products obtained after treatment. This review contains three different sections, their importance and also explained how these technologies can be improved in the future aspects. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","bioremediation; microalga; physiology; procedures; wastewater; water management; water pollutant; Biodegradation, Environmental; Microalgae; Waste Water; Water Pollutants; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification"

It presents desirable characteristics for biomonitoring, including being sessile, widely distributed and abundant, and is a filter-feeder able to accumulate several classes of pollutants (e.g., metals, hydrocarbons, among others). Mussels’ biological responses to pollution exposure can be measured as biomarkers, which include alterations ranging from molecular to physiological levels, to estimate the degree of environmental contamination and its effects on biota. This full review compiles two decades (2000–2020) of literature concerning biological effects on P. perna mussel caused by environmental pollutants (i.e., metals, hydrocarbons, and emerging pollutants), considering environmental and farm-based biomonitoring. Biochemical markers related to mussels’ oxidative status were efficient for the biomonitoring of metals (i.e., antioxidant enzymes associated with oxidative damage in biomolecules). Genotoxicity and cytotoxicity indicators (i.e., comet, micronucleus, and neutral red assays) provided a depiction of hydrocarbon contamination. The neutral red assay gave a time-concentration cytotoxic response to a wide range of pollutants, including emerging pollutants (e.g., pharmaceuticals and biocides) and hydrocarbons. Perna perna hemocyte parameters provided a useful approach for biocide biomonitoring. This paper summarizes useful biomarkers from molecular to physiological levels in this mussel species used to identify and quantify the degree of coastal pollution. An integrated biomarker analysis may provide a way to overcome possible biomarker variations and assess multi-polluted sites. Nevertheless, it is necessary to investigate biomarker variations according to natural factors (e.g., season and gonad maturation stage) to standardize them for trustworthy biomonitoring. © 2021","Biocides; Hydrocarbons; Marine pollution; Molecular biology; Molluscs; Physiological models; Physiology; Tropics; Biochemical markers; Emerging pollutants; Environmental contamination; Environmental pollutants; Environmental pollutions; Hydrocarbon contamination; Physiological levels; Pollution biomarkers; Biomarkers; biomarker; biomonitoring; environmental conditions; heavy metal; hydrocarbon; mussel culture; oxidative stress; seasonal variation; species diversity; Perna perna; biological marker; analysis; animal; environmental monitoring; Perna; pollution; toxicity; water pollutant; Animals; Biomarkers; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Perna; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

This review summarizes the main physical-chemical, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacokinetic properties of ritonavir and lopinavir, along with the analytical methodologies applied for biological matrices, pharmaceutical formulations, and stability studies. The work also aimed to provide a comprehensive impurity profile for the combined formulation. Several analytical methods in four different pharmacopeias and 37 articles in literature were evaluated and summarized. Chromatographic methods for these drugs frequently use C8 or C18 stationary phases with acetonitrile and phosphate buffer (with ultraviolet detection) or acetate buffer (with tandem mass spectrometry detection) as the mobile phase. Official compendia methods show disadvantages as extended total run time and complex mobile phases. HPLC tandem-mass spectrometry provided high sensitivity in methodologies applied for human plasma and serum samples, supporting the therapeutic drug monitoring in HIV patients. Ritonavir and lopinavir major degradation products arise in alkaline and acidic environments, respectively. Other non-chromatographic methods were also summarized. Establishing the impurity profile for the combined formulation is challenging due to a large number of impurities reported.

It plays a crucial scaffolding role to support spermatogenesis. On the other hand, laminin-333 comprised of laminin-α3/ß3/γ3 at the apical ES (ectoplasmic specialization, a testis-specific cell-cell adherens junction at the Sertoli cell-step 8–19 spermatid interface) expressed by spermatids serves as a unique cell adhesion protein that forms an adhesion complex with α6ß1-integrin expressed by Sertoli cells to support spermiogenesis. Emerging evidence has shown that biologically active fragments are derived from basement membrane and apical ES laminin chains through proteolytic cleavage mediated by matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and MMP2, respectively. Two of these laminin bioactive fragments: one from the basement membrane laminin-α2 chain called LG3/4/5-peptide, and one from the apical ES laminin-γ3 chain known as F5-peptide, are potent regulators that modify cell adhesion function at the Sertoli-spermatid interface (i.e., apical ES) but also at the Sertoli cell-cell interface designated basal ES at the blood-testis barrier (BTB) with contrasting effects. These findings not only highlight the physiological significance of these bioactive peptides that create a local regulatory network to support spermatogenesis, they also open a unique area of research. For instance, it is likely that several other bioactive peptides remain to be identified. These bioactive peptides including their downstream signaling proteins and cascades should be studied collectively in future investigations to elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) by which they coordinate with each other to maintain spermatogenesis.

Despite having similar physicochemical properties, enantiomers may differ in their interactions with enzymes, receptors and other chiral molecules leading to different biological response. Their differences in bio-degradation, transformation or accumulation should be carefully considered when assessing health risks since they can affect living organisms in a different way. This work reviews the behavior of several groups of environmentally relevant chiral contaminants including pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, perfluoroalkyl substances, brominated flame retardants, pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls and their main metabolites. The enantioselectivity and fate of these compounds in: i) wastewater treatment plants, ii) aquatic and terrestrial environments; and iii) living organisms is discussed. It cannot be predicted whether each specific enantiomer of a chiral compound will be preferably enriched or degraded. The extent of stereoselectivity is associated to several factors, including the specific chiral pollutant, the environmental matrix, the treatment technology used, as well as the season and local environmental factors (pH, soil texture, porosity, organic amended), which are in turn influenced by the activity of the microbial communities. Therefore the environmental fate of enantiomers always needs to be investigated. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Aquatic organisms; Enantiomers; Enantioselectivity; Environmental technology; Flame retardants; Health risks; Metabolites; Organic pollutants; Physicochemical properties; Risk assessment; Sewage treatment plants; Textures; Wastewater treatment; Brominated flame retardants; Environmental contaminant; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Personal care products; Pharmaceutical compounds; Terrestrial environments; Treatment technologies; Wastewater treatment plants; Stereochemistry; bromine; flame retardant; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl; degradation; drug; environment; environmental fate; physicochemical property; pollutant; wastewater treatment plant; biodegradation; bioremediation; chirality; enantiomer; enantioselectivity; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental risk; health hazard; nonhuman; pH; pollutant; porosity; Review; soil texture; waste water treatment plant"

Among these challenges, it can be highlighted the physical and health damage to the population, interruption of water, energy and food supply services, damage to basic infrastructure, economic losses and contamination of urban rivers. To contribute to the increase of resilience in urban centers, LID practices have been used as a new approach of mitigation and adaptation within urban drainage systems, aiming at runoff retention, peak flow attenuation, pollutant removal and ecosystem services restoration (e.g., resources recycling, carbon sequestration, thermal comfort and landscape integration). These different mitigation purposes and complementary benefits provided by LID practices can be related to the different Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) presented by the United Nations (UN), to achieve countries’ systemic sustainability. The identification of local techniques that contribute to the different SDG helps to achieve their territorialization and application as public policy. Therefore, this paper presents a literature review, categorizing the studies into different generations based on their main application purpose and presents a linkage of the LID benefits to different SDG. Some challenges were identified requiring further investigation, such as the need to identify and quantify the energy demands for LID practices maintenance and their incorporation in the system final energy balance, identification of processes that contribute to carbon sequestration and emission, and risks of emerging pollutants for human health from water reuse and nutrient cycling for sustainable agriculture. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Carbon; Climate change; Ecosystems; Food supply; Health risks; Losses; Planning; Runoff; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Water pollution; Carbon sequestration; Emerging pollutants; Landscape integration; Literature reviews; Low impact development; Resources recycling; Sustainable agriculture; Urban drainage systems; Sustainable development; storm water; adaptive management; climate change; ecosystem service; food supply; mitigation; nutrient cycling; pollutant removal; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; urban drainage; urbanization; air pollution; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; catchment area (hydrology); catering service; climate change; climate resilience; drought; ecosystem service; evapotranspiration; human; hydraulic conductivity; hydropower; land use; natural resource; nutrient cycling; peak expiratory flow; public policy; recycling; Review; runoff; soil moisture; sustainable agriculture; sustainable development goal; United Nations; urbanization; waste water recycling; water quality; water treatment; watershed"

Based on more than 100 articles published from 2000 to date, this review summarizes current knowledge on prenatal and postnatal transfer of PFASs from mothers to fetuses/infants. Transplacental transfer efficiencies (RCM) differ among individual PFASs, depending on the alkyl chain length, the function groups, and the branching position in the molecule, and showing enantioselectivity for chiral 1 m-PFOS. Transfer efficiency from serum to breast milk (TEBS/MS) is lower than RCM, but PFAS exposure of infants through breastfeeding in the first month was assessed to be greater than that through transplacental transfer during the entire gestation period. Based on the latest promulgated reference doses, infants would face potential health risks.

In the present review, we have collected the available information on prefoldin family members of archaea and humans and attempted to analyze unexplored PFD subunits of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). Our review enhances the understanding of probable functions, structure and mechanism of substrate binding of Pf prefoldin by comparing with the available information of its homologs in archaea and H. sapiens. Three PfPFD out of six and a Pf prefoldin-like protein are reported to be essential for parasite survival that signifies their importance in malaria parasite biology. Transcriptome analyses suggest that PfPFD subunits are up-regulated at the mRNA level during asexual and sexual stages of parasite life cycle. Our in silico analysis suggested several pivotal proteins like myosin E, cytoskeletal protein (tubulin), merozoite surface protein and ring exported protein 3 as their interacting partners. Based on structural information of archaeal and H. sapiens PFDs, P. falciparum counterparts have been modelled and key interface residues were identified that are critical for oligomerization of PfPFD subunits. We collated information on PFD-substrate binding and PFD-chaperonin interaction in detail to understand the mechanism of substrate delivery in archaea and humans.

PFAS have drawn increasing attention due to their frequent occurrence in the aquatic environment and their toxicity to animals and humans. Developing effective and efficient detection and remediation methods for PFAS in aquatic systems is critical to mitigate ongoing exposure and promote water reuse. Adsorption-based removal is the most common method for PFAS remediation since it avoids hazardous byproducts; in situ sensing technology is a promising approach for PFAS monitoring due to its fast response, easy operation, and portability. This review summarizes current materials and devices that have been demonstrated for PFAS adsorption and sensing. Selectivity, the key factor underlying both sensor and sorbent performance, is discussed by exploring the interactions between PFAS and various probes. Examples of selective probes will be presented and classified by fluorinated groups, cationic groups, and cavitary groups, and their synergistic effects will also be analyzed. This review aims to provide guidance and implication for future material design toward more selective and effective PFAS sensors and sorbents. © 2021 The Authors.

Recent studies have shown that cadmium (e.g., cadmium chloride, CdCl2) and PFOS exert their disruptive effects through putative signaling proteins and signaling cascade similar to other pharmaceuticals, such as the non-hormonal male contraceptive drug adjudin. More important, these signaling proteins were also shown to be involved in modulating testis function based on studies in rodents. Collectively, these findings suggest that toxicants are using similar mechanisms that used to support spermatogenesis under physiological conditions to perturb Sertoli and testis function. These observations are physiologically significant, since a manipulation on the expression of these signaling proteins can possibly be used to manage the toxicant-induced male reproductive dysfunction. In this review, we highlight some of these findings and critically evaluate the possibility of using this approach to manage toxicant-induced defects in spermatrogenesis based on recent studies in animal models.

The TxSnFELS is very common and not diagnostic for any chemical or class of chemicals. This sublethal toxicity syndrome is mostly observed at high exposure concentrations and appears to be a baseline, non-specific toxicity response; however, it can also occur at low doses by specific action. Toxicity metrics for this syndrome generally occur at concentrations just below those causing mortality and have been reported for a large number of diverse chemicals. Predictions based on tissue concentrations or quantitative-structure activity relationship (QSAR) models support the designation of baseline toxicity for many of the tested chemicals, which is confirmed by observed values. Given the sheer number of disparate chemicals causing the TxSnFELS and correlation with QSAR derived partitioning; the only logical conclusion for these high-dose responses is baseline toxicity by nonspecific action and not a lock and key type receptor response. It is important to recognize that many chemicals can act both as baseline toxicants and specific acting toxicants likely via receptor interaction and it is not possible to predict those threshold doses from baseline toxicity. We should search out these specific low-dose responses for ecological risk assessment and not rely on high-concentration toxicity responses to guide environmental protection. The goal for toxicity assessment should not be to characterize toxic responses at baseline toxicity concentrations, but to evaluate chemicals for their most toxic potential. Additional aspects of this review evaluated the fish ELS teratogenic responses in relation to mammalian oral LD50s and explored potential key events responsible for baseline toxicity. © 2021","Computational chemistry; Fish; Indicators (chemical); Mammals; Molecular graphics; Risk assessment; Baseline toxicity; Earliest life; Fish early-life stage; High dose; Life stages; Low dose; Mechanism of action; Sublethal toxicity; Sublethal toxicity syndrome; Teratogen; Toxicity; 3,4 dichloroaniline; 4 nonylphenol; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; acetochlor; acrylamide; alcohol; atrazine; bisphenol F; bisphenol S; caffeine; carbamazepine; cetirizine; chlorpyrifos; cyanide; diclofenac; dimethyl sulfoxide; dimetindene; doxylamine; ethinylestradiol; ethosuximide; fenitrothion; genistein; isoniazid; ketotifen; parathion; pentachlorophenol; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; phenanthrene; phenol derivative; propranolol; pyriproxyfen; retinoic acid; tebuconazole; triadimefon; unclassified drug; valproic acid; concentration (composition); environmental protection; sublethal effect; toxicity; concentration (parameter); ecology; ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; environmental protection; fish; human; LD50; life cycle stage; mammal; mortality rate; nonhuman; prediction; Review; risk assessment; structure activity relation; animal; dangerous goods; quantitative structure activity relation; toxicity; water pollutant; Mammalia; Animals; Fishes; Hazardous Substances; Lethal Dose 50; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

They have been extensively produced since 1940s due to enormous applications as a surface-active agent, and water and oil repellent characteristics. PFASs are made to be non-biodegradable, therefore, many of them have been found in the environment albeit strict regulations have been in place since 2002. PFASs are extremely toxic compounds that can impart harm in both fauna and flora. Recent investigations have shown that wetlands might be useful for their removal from the environment as a passive and nature-based solution. To this end, understanding the role of plants, microbes, and their combined plant-microbe interplay is crucial because it could help design a sophisticated passive treatment wetland system. This review focuses on how these components (plants, microbe, substrate) can influence PFASs removal in wetlands under natural and controlled conditions. The information on underlying removal mechanisms is mostly retrieved from laboratory-based studies; however, pilot- and field-scale data are also presented to provide insights on their real-time performance. Briefly, a traditional wetland system works on the principles of phytouptake, bioaccumulation, and sorption, which are mainly due to the fact that PFASs are synthetic compounds that have very low reactivity in the environment. Nevertheless, recent investigations have also shown that Feammox process in wetlands can mineralize the PFASs; thus, opens new opportunities for PFASs degradation in terms of effective plant-microbe interplay in the wetlands. The choice of plants and bacterial species is however crucial, and the system efficiency relies on species-specific, sediment-specific and pollutant-specific principles. More research is encouraged to identify genetic elements and molecular mechanisms that can help us harness effective plant-microbe interplay in wetlands for the successful removal of PFASs from the environment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bacteria; Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Petroleum prospecting; Sorption; Surface active agents; Surface chemistry; Aliphatic compound; In planta bioaccumulation; Organofluorine; Phytouptake; Plant-microbe interplay; Poly-fluoroalkyl substance removal; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Surface active water; Surface-active agents; Wetland systems; Wetlands; chemical compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; water; bioaccumulation; chemical compound; fauna; flora; pollutant removal; real time; sorption; wetland; chemical analysis; environmental factor; genetic analysis; microorganism; physical chemistry; plant; Review; synthesis; wetland; plant; water pollutant; wetland; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fluorocarbons; Plants; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Wetlands"

Conventionally, the carboxylative cyclization comprises CO2 capture and subsequent nucleophilic attack of the resulting carboxylic anion to an unsaturated bond, by which the monofunctionalization of the unsaturated bond is realized and the heterocyclic compounds, such as 5-/6-membered cyclolactone, cyclocarbonate, and oxazolidinone, are accordingly generated. Nowadays, the CO2-participated multicomponent carboxylative cyclizations have evoked intense interest due to their ability to perform the bifunctionalization of the unsaturated bond in the ring-closing step, thus assembling complex molecules. Up to now, by activating the unsaturated bonds with functionalized reagents and designing cascade reactions of organometallic compounds, substituents including iodine, trifluoromethyl, perfluoroalkyl, alkyl, cyanoalkyl, allyl, aryl, phenoxy, allenyl, selenyl, amino, and phosphonyl groups have been incorporated into the cyclocarbonate or oxazolidinone compounds successfully through the multicomponent carboxylative cyclizations.

The carbon-fluorine bond of PFAS provides desirable hydrophobic and oleophobic properties and stability that has led to widespread usage in consumer products and industrial applications. The strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also prevents appreciable degradation once released into the environment. Consequently, various household products can release volatile and nonvolatile PFAS into the indoor environment that often concentrate in dust. We discuss the diversity of PFAS in settled dust, emission sources of these chemicals, changes in PFAS profiles in dust over the past century, and the implications for human health. Recent Findings: Sources of PFAS found in dust include building materials and furnishings and consumer products used in typical indoor spaces. Daycares and workplaces are emphasized as locations with widespread exposure due to the presence of treated carpeting and industrial-strength cleaners. Comparison and interpretation of findings across studies are complicated by the different ways in which PFAS are screened across studies. We further discuss recent developments in non-targeted software for the comprehensive annotation of PFAS in indoor dust and emphasize the need for comprehensive and harmonized analytical workflows. Summary: We highlight the detection and diversity of PFAS in settled dust collected from various indoor spaces, including locations with vulnerable subpopulations. There are opportunities for future research to leverage settled dust as a sentinel environmental matrix to evaluate the link between inhalation and ingestion routes of PFAS exposure to adverse health. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","fluorocarbon; dust; human; indoor air pollution; prevalence; Air Pollution, Indoor; Dust; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Prevalence"

The etiology of MRKH syndrome is complex and largely unexplained. Familial clustering suggests a genetic component and the spectrum of clinical presentations seems consistent with an inheritance pattern characterized by incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Mutations of several candidate genes have been proposed as possible causes based on genetic analyses of human patients and animal models. In addition, studies of monozygotic twins with discordant phenotypes suggest a role for epigenetic changes following potential exposure to environmental compounds. The spectrum of clinical presentations is consistent with intricate disruptions of shared developmental pathways or signals during early organogenesis. However, the lack of functional validation and translational studies have limited our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in this condition. The clinical management of affected women, including early diagnosis, genetic testing of MRKH syndrome, and the implementation of counseling strategies, is significantly impeded by these knowledge gaps. Here, we illustrate the embryonic development of tissues and organs affected by MRKH syndrome, highlighting key pathways that could be involved in its pathogenesis.

However, the microporous structure of conventional zeolite materials limits their applications to small-molecule reactions. To alleviate this problem, mesoporous zeolitic frameworks were developed. In the last few decades, several methods have been developed for the synthesis of mesoporous zeolites; these zeolites have demonstrated greater lifetime and better performance than their bulk microporous counterparts in many catalytic processes, which can be explained by the rapid diffusion of reactant species into the zeolite framework and facile accessibility to bulky molecules through the mesopores. Mesoporous zeolites provide versatile opportunities not only in conventional chemical industries but also in emerging catalysis fields. This review presents many state-of-the-art mesoporous zeolites, discusses various strategies for their synthesis, and details their contributions to catalytic reactions including catalytic cracking, isomerization, alkylation and acylation, alternative fuel synthesis via methanol-to-hydrocarbon (MTH) and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) routes, and different fine-chemical syntheses. © 2021 by the authors.

This is not fully explained by established risk factors. Concurrent, increasing exposure to antiandrogenic environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in fetal life may partially explain this trend. This systematic review assessed available evidence regarding the association between environmental EDC exposure and risk of testicular cancer (seminomas and nonseminomas). Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of English peer-reviewed literature published prior to December 14, 2020 in the databases PubMed and Embase® was performed. Among the 279 identified records, 19 were eligible for quality assessment and 10 for further meta-analysis. The completeness of reporting was high across papers, but over 50% were considered subject to potential risk of bias. Mean age at diagnosis was 31.9 years. None considered effects of EDC multipollutant mixtures. The meta-analyses showed that maternal exposure to combined EDCs was associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer in male offspring [summary risk ratios: 2.16, (95% CI:1.78-2.62), 1.93 (95% CI:1.49-2.48), and 2.78 (95% CI:2.27-3.41) for all, seminoma, and nonseminoma, respectively]. Similarly, high maternal exposures to grouped organochlorines and organohalogens were associated with higher risk of seminoma and nonseminoma in the offspring. Summary estimates related to postnatal adult male EDC exposures were inconsistent. Maternal, but not postnatal adult male, EDC exposures were consistently associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer, particularly risk of nonseminomas. However, the quality of studies was mixed, and considering the fields complexity, more prospective studies of prenatal EDC multipollutant mixture exposures and testicular cancer are needed. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

This poses significant regulatory questions and a pronounced need for chemical risk assessments, analytical methods, and technological solutions to reduce the risk to public and environmental health. The effects of PFAS on biological systems may be complex. Each may have several molecular targets initiating multiple biochemical events leading to a number of different adverse outcomes. An exposure to mixtures or coexposures of PFAS complicates the picture further. This review illustrates how PFAS target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Additionally, we describe how such activation leads to changes in cell differentiation and bone development that contributes to metabolic disorder and bone weakness. This discussion sheds light on the importance of seemingly modest outcomes observed in test animals and highlights why the most sensitive end points identified in some chemical risk assessments are significant from a public health perspective. © 2021 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Endocrine Society.","cell nucleus receptor; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; polyfluoroalkyl substance; thyroid hormone; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; protein binding; adipose tissue; adverse event; adverse outcome pathway; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; body mass; bone development; bone disease; cell differentiation; chemical interaction; controlled study; DNA binding; energy metabolism; environmental health; female; gene targeting; genetic transcription; in vitro study; insulin sensitivity; ligand binding; male; MC3T3-E1 cell line; metabolic disorder; nerve cell differentiation; nonhuman; prenatal exposure; proadipocyte; resting metabolic rate; Review; risk assessment; thyroid follicular cell; adipose tissue; adverse event; animal; bone; drug effect; human; metabolism; pharmacology; physiology; pollutant; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Bone and Bones; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; PPAR gamma; Protein Binding"

Conventional water purification systems are less efficient in removing these pollutants; therefore, innovative, and eco-friendly technologies are needed. Recently, semiconductor-supported photocatalysis has attracted attention in environmental remediation for removing EP's owing to their unique characteristics of low-cost, higher thermal and mechanical stability, and excellent pollutant removal efficiency. The charge separation and effective light absorption, particularly in the visible region, are two essential characteristics in photocatalyst which are hard to achieve. Several approaches have been adopted to enhance the charge separation and light-absorption ability in the visible range, including elemental-doping, morphology-engineering, and composite photocatalyst formation. This review concisely discusses the several recently discovered EP's, their fate and transport properties, as well as recent progress in the design and development of visible light-responsive photocatalysts for degradation of EP's. Furthermore, synthesis methods, key features such as optical properties, energy-bandgap structure, crystallinity, and surface features are emphasized in this review. The influencing process parameters, reusability, and stability of photocatalyst are also outlined.

Available data dealing with the sources, occurrence and removal of EPs within the MENA region in different categories of water is collected, presented and analyzed in this literature review. According to the collected database, the occurrence and removal efficiency of EPs in the water matrix in the MENA region is available, respectively, for 13 and six countries of the 18 in total; no available data is registered for the rest. Altogether, 290 EPs have been observed in different water matrices across the MENA countries, stemming mainly from industrial effluents, agricultural practices, and discharge or reuse of treated wastewater (TWW). Pharmaceutical compounds figure among the most frequently reported compounds in wastewater, TWW, surface water, and drinking water. Nevertheless, pesticides are the most frequently detected pollutants in groundwater. Worryingly, 57 cases of EPs have been reported in different fresh and drinking waters, exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) and European Commission (EC) thresholds. Overall, pharmaceuticals, organic compounds, and pesticides are the most concerning EP groups. The review revealed the ineffectiveness of treatment processes used in the region to remove EPs. Negative removals of some EPs such as carbamazepine, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole were recorded, suggesting their possible accumulation or release during treatment. This underlines the need to set in place and strengthen control measures, treatment procedures, standards, and policies for such pollutants in the region. © 2021, The Author(s).","European Commission; freshwater; literature review; pollutant removal; wastewater treatment; water pollution; water quality; Middle East; North Africa; drug; ground water; environmental monitoring; pollutant; wastewater; water pollutant; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Groundwater; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

After plenary presentations, breakout groups were established and tasked to identify and adjudicate via panel discussions overarching conclusions and relevant data gaps. The present review is one in a series and summarizes outcomes of presentations and breakout discussions related to (1) primary sources and pathways in the environment, (2) sorption and transport in porous media, (3) precursor transformation, (4) practical approaches to the assessment of source zones, (5) standard and novel analytical methods with implications for environmental forensics and site management, and (6) classification and grouping from multiple perspectives. Outcomes illustrate that PFAS classification will continue to be a challenge, and additional pressing needs include increased availability of analytical standards and methods for assessment of PFAS and fate and transport, including precursor transformation.

It examines the efficacy of a range of amendments, including those with binding agents, along with a discussion of immobilisation mechanisms and post-immobilisation assessment needs. Recent Findings: Researchers have recently applied a variety of soil amendments to soil for PFAS immobilisation. Efficacy of these has varied widely, both between amendment and soil types and for individual PFAS molecules present in contaminated soils. Activated carbon based amendments, including composite amendments exhibit the highest efficacies of the examined studies. Summary: Immobilisation of PFAS is complex, with efficacy of immobilisation varying with soil properties including pH, clay and organic matter content, amendment properties, and molecular properties of the individual PFAS. Optimal remediation strategies need to be adjusted accordingly to site specific soil properties and contamination profiles. Additionally, bioavailability testing needs to supplement standard leaching approaches to determine effectiveness of PFAS soil immobilisation strategies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

Holistic assessments of the adverse health effects and systematic elucidation of the mechanisms underlying environmental exposures are major scientific challenges with widespread societal implications. However, to date, few studies have comprehensively and simultaneously measured airborne pollutant exposures and explored the associated biomarkers in susceptible healthy elderly subjects, potentially resulting in the suboptimal assessment and management of health risks. To demonstrate the exposome paradigm, we describe the rationale and design of a comprehensive biomarker and biomonitoring panel study to systematically explore the association between individual airborne exposure and adverse health outcomes. We used a combination of personal monitoring for airborne pollutants, extensive human biomonitoring, advanced omics analysis, confounding information, and statistical methods. We established an exploratory panel study of Biomarkers of Air Pollutant Exposure in Chinese people aged 60–69 years (China BAPE), which included 76 healthy residents from a representative community in Jinan City, Shandong Province. During the period between September 2018 and January 2019, we conducted prospective longitudinal monitoring with a 3-day assessment every month. This project: (1) leveraged advanced tools for personal airborne exposure monitoring (external exposures); (2) comprehensively characterized biological samples for exogenous and endogenous compounds (e.g., targeted and untargeted monitoring) and multi-omics scale measurements to explore potential biomarkers and putative toxicity pathways; and (3) systematically evaluated the relationships between personal exposure to air pollutants, and novel biomarkers of exposures and effects using exposome-wide association study approaches. These findings will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the adverse health impacts of air pollution exposures and identify potential adverse clinical outcomes that can facilitate the development of effective prevention and targeted intervention techniques. © 2021","Air pollution; Health; Health risks; Risk assessment; Air pollutants; Airborne pollutants; Chinese people; Exposome-wide association study; Exposomic; Metabolomics; Panel studies; Personal exposure monitoring; PM 2.5; Pollutant exposures; Biomarkers; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; aromatic hydrocarbon; biological marker; interleukin 1; interleukin 3; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; mitochondrial DNA; monoaromatic hydrocarbon; organophosphate; perfluoro compound; phthalic acid ester; polybrominated biphenyl; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; biological marker; atmospheric pollution; biomarker; biomonitoring; health risk; metabolism; panel data; particulate matter; pollution exposure; adverse outcome; aging; air pollutant; airborne particle; biochemical analysis; biological monitoring; blood sampling; cardiovascular disease; Chinese; clinical outcome; cognitive defect; documentation; endocrine disease; environmental exposure; epigenetics; exposome wide association study; human; inflammation; lipid metabolism; lipidomics; lung function; metabolomics; microbiomics; multiomics; nonhuman; oxidative stress; personal monitoring; pictorial documentation; proteomics; questionnaire; Review; telomere length; toxicity; transcriptomics; types of study; urine sampling; aged; analysis; China; environmental exposure; prospective study; China; Jinan [Shandong]; Shandong; Aged; Air Pollutants; Biomarkers; China; Environmental Exposure; Exposome; Humans; Prospective Studies"

Nowadays, their potential non-bioaccumulable alternatives have been developed to meet the requirements of environmental sustainable development. In this paper, the recent advances of potential non-bioaccumulable fluorinated surfactants with different fluorocarbon chain structures, including the short perfluorocarbon chain, the branched fluorocarbon chain, and the fluorocarbon chain with weak points, are reviewed from the aspects of synthesis processes, properties, and structure-activity relationships. And their applications in emulsion polymerization of fluorinated olefins, handling membrane proteins, and leather manufacture also are summarized. Furthermore, the challenges embedded in the current non-bioaccumulable fluorinated surfactants are also highlighted and discussed with the hope to provide a valuable reference for the prosperous development of fluorinated surfactants.

Studies that report on this association are difficult to summarize due to weak associations and wide confidence intervals. One way to advance this field is to sharpen the biologic theory on a causal pathway behind this association, and to measure it directly by way of molecular biomarkers. The aim of this review is to summarize the literature that supports a novel pathway between PFAS exposure and GDM development. Epidemiological studies demonstrate a clear association of biomarkers of thyroid hormones and glucose metabolism with GDM development. We report biologic plausibility and epidemiologic evidence that PFAS dysregulation of maternal thyroid hormones and thyrotropin (TSH) may disrupt glucose homeostasis, increasing the risk of GDM. Overall, epidemiological studies demonstrate that PFAS were positively associated with TSH and negatively with triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4).

Aside from the treatment dose, other factors that can influence the ketogenic response, such as accompanying meals, fasting duration, and caffeine intake, were assessed. Based on the available literature, four practical recommendations are made to optimize the ketogenic effect of MCTs and reduce unwanted side effects (primarily gastrointestinal discomfort and diarrhea). First, the starting dose should be either 5 g of octanoic acid [caprylic acid (C8); a component of MCTs] or 5 g of a combination of C8 and decanoic or capric acid (C10; another component of MCTs), and the dose should be progressively increased to 15–20 g of C8. Second, MCTs should be consumed after an overnight fast, without an accompanying meal if tolerable, or with a low-carbohydrate meal. Third, the addition of caffeine may slightly increase the ketogenic response. Fourth, emulsifying the MCTs might increase their ketogenic effect and alleviate side effects.

They belong to the class of perfluoroalkyl substances, possessing properties such as high chemical stability, high mobility, high water solubility, extraordinary persistence in the environment, bioaccumulability in living tissues, and toxicity. Because of such properties, HFPO-DA and GenX are ubiquitously found in the environment, where they can remain almost unmutated for an extremely long time, so that such chemicals, together with the other perfluoroalkyl substances, are being named “forever chemicals”. Due to their adverse effects on human health and the environment, growing regulatory attention is paid to these pollutants. Parallelly, new technologies for their removal are highly necessary because conventional ones are almost ineffective. However, there is limited available information regarding the effectiveness of HFPO-DA and GenX treatment methods. The present article reviews the characteristics and occurrence of these emerging chemicals in the environment. Also, the removability of HFPO-DA and GenX by novel treatment approaches (membranes, adsorption, and degradation techniques) and conventional wastewater treatment are discussed. Studies reported in the literature indicate that these chemicals are not efficaciously eliminated by conventional technologies currently used in wastewater treatment plants. Early observations suggest that adsorption and high-pressure membranes could be considered the most promising removal technologies available on the market. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biochemistry; Chemical stability; Chemicals; Wastewater treatment; Ammonium salt; Anthropogenics; Dimer acids; Forever chemical; Genx; Hexafluoropropylene oxide; Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid; Perfluoroalkyl substances; PFAS; Property; Dimers"

While considerable progress has been made in this particular field of research, activating strong bonds, such as the C-F bond, continues to be a challenge. Because polyfluorinated compounds are commercially available, the functionalization of C-F bonds has been extensively studied for preparing partially fluorinated compounds, some of which are biologically active and are used as functionalized materials. However, chemo- and regioselective methods are still required to prepare useful partially fluorinated compounds. In addition, a new strategy for the activation of a C-F bond in less reactive monofluorinated compounds remains a need. Directed strategies have been extensively used in C-H bond activation chemistry to achieve high efficiency as well as a high regioselectivity. On the other hand, a directed strategy that is applicable to the activation of various unreactive bonds, such as C-O, C-N, C-F, and others is still needed, compared with directed C-H bond activation.

The most common method for PFAS removal from water is by sorption with activated carbons or ion exchange resins, but these adsorbents only exhibit limited removal efficiency against short-chain PFAS, and they require frequent replacement leading to high operational cost. Here we review and discuss the potential of using bio-adsorbents, which can be derived from common biomass feedstocks, as low-cost alternatives to traditional adsorbents, while these materials can also possess good removal efficiency against short-chain PFAS.

The results showed that the interaction between antibiotics and heavy metals was affected by the types of functional groups, the types of heavy metal ions and the pH of the solution.

These compounds are ubiquitously bioaccumulated in the environment and food chain for a long period due to their high chemical and biological stability. PFOS and PFOA are currently being transmitted via the aquatic medium, posing a concern not only to the aquatic ecosystem but also to human and animal health. Evidence of PFOS and PFOA-based toxicity has been associated with hepatoxicity, immunotoxicity, developmental toxicity, endocrine disruptor, and cancer. PFOS and PFOA are primarly absorbed into the animal and human body through ingestion and bioaccumulate in the plasma, liver, and kidney. PFOS and PFOA are difficult to degrade, and as a result, they are frequently excreted in urine in their unchanged form. Methods for detecting PFOS and PFOA at trace levels in environmental and food matrices have been improved over time, resulting in their detection in a variety of environmental and food matrices. Nowadays, PFOS and PFOS have been identified as potential hazards and are included as novel persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the Stockholm Convention, however their use in some countries such as Malaysia is unregulated. Although PFOS and PFOA have been widely explored in the environment and in food, and toxicological effects in some animals have been identified, human studies warrant further investigation. © 2021 UPM Press.

PFAS have been detected in the blood, liver, kidney, heart, muscle and brain of various species. Although brain is not a dominant tissue for PFAS accumulation compared to blood and liver, adverse effects of PFAS on brain functions have been identified. Here, we review studies related to the absorption, accumulation, distribution and toxicity of PFAS in the brain. We summarize evidence on two potential mechanisms of PFAS entering the brain: initiating blood-brain barrier (BBB) disassembly through disrupting tight junctions and relying on transporters located at the BBB. PFAS with diverse structures and properties enter and accumulate in the brain with varying efficiencies. Compared to long-chain PFAS, short-chain PFAS may not cross cerebral barriers effectively. According to biomonitoring studies and PFAS exposure experiments, PFAS can accumulate in the brain of humans and wildlife species. With respect to the distribution of PFAS in specific brain regions, the brain stem, hippocampus, hypothalamus, pons/medulla and thalamus are dominant for PFAS accumulation. The accumulation and distribution of PFAS in the brain may lead to toxic effects in the central nervous system (CNS), including PFAS-induced behavioral and cognitive disorders. The specific mechanisms underlying such PFAS-induced neurotoxicity remain to be explored, but two major potential mechanisms based on current understanding are PFAS effects on calcium homeostasis and neurotransmitter alterations in neurons. Based on the information available about PFAS uptake, accumulation, distribution and impacts on the brain, PFAS have the potential to enter and accumulate in the brain at varying levels. The balance of existing studies shows there is some indication of risk in animals, while the human evidence is mixed and warrants further scrutiny.

Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), antibiotics, and hormones that are used in great demand for health and cosmetic purposes have rapidly culminated in the emergence of environmental pollutants. EPs impact the environment in a variety of ways. EPs originate from animal or human sources, either directly discharged into waterbodies or slowly leached via soils. As a result, water quality will deteriorate, drinking water sources will be contaminated, and health issues will arise. Since drinking water treatment plants rely on water resources, the prevalence of this contamination in aquatic environments, particularly surface water, is a severe problem. The review looks into several related issues on EPs in water environment, including methods in removing EPs. Despite its benefits and downsides, the EPs treatment processes comprise several approaches such as physico-chemical, biological, and advanced oxidation processes. Nonetheless, one of the membrane-based filtration methods, ultrafiltration, is considered as one of the technologies that promises the best micropollutant removal in water. With interesting properties including a moderate operating manner and great selectivity, this treatment approach is more popular than conventional ones.

These processes are orchestrated by intracellular, endocrine, and paracrine signaling processes. Because of this complexity, testis development can be disrupted by a variety of environmental toxicants. The toxicity of phthalic acid esters (phthalates) on the fetal testis has been the subject of extensive research for two decades, and phthalates have become an archetypal fetal testis toxicant. Phthalates disrupt the seminiferous cord formation and maturation, Sertoli cell function, biosynthesis of testosterone in Leydig cells, and impair germ cell survival and development, producing characteristic multinucleated germ cells. However, the mechanisms responsible for these effects are not fully understood. This review describes current knowledge of the adverse effects of phthalates on the fetal testis and their associated windows of sensitivity, and compares and contrasts the mechanisms by which toxicants of current interest, bisphenol A and its replacements, analgesics, and perfluorinated alkyl substances, alter testicular developmental processes.

Treatment strategies using clay minerals and oxidic clays are inexpensive, eco-friendly, and efficient for bulk PFAS removal due to their high surface areas, porosity, and high loading capacity. A comparison of partition coefficient values calculated from extracted data in published literature indicate that organically-modified clay minerals are the best-performing adsorbent for PFAS removal. In this review, we scrutinize the corresponding plausible mechanisms, factors, and challenges affecting the PFAS removal processes, demonstrating that modified clay minerals (e.g., surfactant, amine), including some commercially available products (e.g., FLUORO-SORB®, RemBind®, matCARE™), show good efficacy in PFAS remediation in contaminated media under field conditions. Finally, we propose future research to focus on the challenges of using clay-based adsorbents for PFAS removal from contaminated water due to the regeneration and safe-disposal of spent clay adsorbents is still a major issue, whilst enhancing the PFAS removal efficiency should be an ongoing scientific effort. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption; Aluminum compounds; Graphene oxide; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Potable water; Remediation; Toxicity; Biochar; Clay and clay mineral; Clay-biochar composite; Clean water and sanitation; Clean waters; Green and sustainable remediation; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substance; State of the art; Water state; Clay minerals"

Most synthetic dyes have complex aromatic structures and are resistant to degrade by classical approaches, such as physical and chemical processes, including adsorption, chemical coagulation, flocculation, ion exchange, membrane separation, froth flotation, and reverse osmosis. Enzymes-assisted catalytic transformation of pollutants has become a potential alternative to classical methods because of their ability to react with complex compounds, a quick degradation rate, and producing less harmful by-products. Plant peroxidases, and microbial laccase and lignin-degrading peroxidases (manganese and lignin peroxidase) have gained significant attention for treating aromatic waste due to their capability of oxidizing and detoxifying a wide range of recalcitrant xenobiotics, including PAHs and synthetic dyes. Peroxidases being efficient biocatalysts detoxify an array of toxic compounds by simple free-radical mechanism resulting in the formation of oxidized and depolymerized products of significantly reduced toxicity. Moreover, it is an ecofriendly and economically favorable approach towards the biodegradation of recalcitrant and toxic industrial waste. Among microbial and plant peroxidases, bacterial enzymes have broad substrate specificity and can transform a wide range of recalcitrant substrates. Ligninolytic enzymes oxidize the aromatic ring into quinones and acids by producing free hydroxyl radicals instead of dihydrodiols and mineralize aromatic hydrocarbon in combination with cytochrome P450, monooxygenases, and epoxide hydrolases. In the review, an attempt has been made to provide detailed knowledge about the availability of inexpensive peroxidases sources, their mechanism of action, and degradation potential. The present review summarizes the exploitation of peroxidases from plants, bacteria, and fungus (manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase, and laccases) for detoxification and degradation of textile dyes as well as PAHs. Conclusively, peroxidases have great potential to react with almost all classes of synthetic dyes and most PAHs due to broad substrate specificity and transformed them into less harmful metabolites. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","bacterial protein; coloring agent; fungal protein; laccase; peroxidase; plant protein; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; bioremediation; catalysis; metabolism; waste disposal; Bacterial Proteins; Biodegradation, Environmental; Catalysis; Coloring Agents; Fungal Proteins; Laccase; Peroxidases; Plant Proteins; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Refuse Disposal"

They are the downstream target of various signaling pathways, and their up/down-regulation affects various physiological processes. PIM family comprises three isoforms, namely, PIM-1, PIM-2, and PIM-3, on alternative initiation of translation and they have different levels of expression in different types of cancers. Its structure shows a unique ATP-binding site in the hinge region which makes it unique among other kinases. Scope of review: PIM kinases are widely reported in hematological malignancies along with prostate and breast cancers. Currently, many drugs are used as inhibitors of PIM kinases. In this review, we highlighted the physiological significance of PIM kinases in the context of disease progression and therapeutic targeting. We comprehensively reviewed the PIM kinases in terms of their expression and regulation of different physiological roles. We further predicted functional partners of PIM kinases to elucidate their role in the cellular physiology of different cancer and mapped their interaction network. Major conclusions: A deeper mechanistic insight into the PIM signaling involved in regulating different cellular processes, including transcription, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, cell migration and senescence, is provided. Furthermore, structural features of PIM have been dissected to understand the mechanism of inhibition and subsequent implication of designed inhibitors towards therapeutic management of prostate, breast and other cancers.

Their widespread use makes them a potential route of exposure for certain contaminants to which human would not be normally exposed. One of these contaminants includes endocrine disrupting chemicals, molecules capable of mimicking the body's natural hormones and interfering with the endocrine system. Some of them are ingredients included in the product's formulation, such as UV-filters (sunscreens), phthalates (plasticizers and preservatives), synthetic musks (fragrances), parabens and other antimicrobial agents (antimicrobial preservatives). Others are non-intended added substances that may result from the manufacturing process or migration from the plastic packaging, as with bisphenols and perfluorinated compounds. Some of these endocrine disruptors have been restricted or even banned in cosmetics and PCPs given the high risk they pose to health. Thus, the development of fast, sensitive and precise methods for the identification and quantification of these compounds in cosmetics is a substantial need in order to ensure consumer safety and provide insight into the real risk of human exposure.

Since the soil environment has become a significant sink for PFCs, the toxicological assessment about their potential effects on terrestrial organisms is necessary. This review compiles the toxicity researches of regular and emerging PFCs on classical terrestrial biota i.e. microorganisms, earthworms, and plants. In the soil environment, the bioavailability of PFCs much depends on their adsorption in soil, which is affected by soil properties and PFCs structure. By the exploration of bacterial community richness and structure, the gene expression, the influences of PFCs on soil microorganisms were revealed; while the plants and earthworms manifested the PFCs disruption not only through macroscopic indicators, but also from molecular and metabolite responses. Basically, the addition of PFCs would accelerate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in terrestrial organisms, while the excessive ROS could not be eliminated by the defense system causing oxidative damage. Nowadays, the PFCs toxic mechanisms discussed are limited to a single strain, Escherichia coli; thus, the complexity of the soil environment demands further in-depth researches.

The soil–plant system plays an important role in the bioaccumulation of PFASs. Because most PFASs in the natural environment are anionic and amphiphilic (both lipophilic and hydrophilic), their sorption and accumulation behaviors differ from those of neutral organic and common ionic compounds. In this review, we discuss processes affecting the availability of PFASs in soil after analyzing the potential mechanisms underlying the sorption and uptake of PFASs in the soil–plant system. We also summarize the current knowledge on root uptake and translocation of PFASs in plants. We found that the root concentration factor of PFASs for plants grown in soil was not significantly correlated with hydrophobicity, whereas the translocation factor was significantly and negatively correlated with PFAS hydrophobicity regardless of whether plants were grown hydroponically or in soil. Further research on the cationic, neutral, and zwitterionic forms of diverse PFASs is urgently needed to comprehensively understand the environmental fates of PFASs in the soil–plant system. Additional research directions are suggested, including the development of more accurate models and techniques to evaluate the bioavailability of PFASs, the effects of root exudates and rhizosphere microbiota on the bioavailability and plant uptake of PFASs, and the roles of different plant organelles, lipids, and proteins in the accumulation of PFASs by plants. © 2021","Health risks; Hydrophobicity; Soils; Sorption; Amphiphilics; Ecosystem health; Human health; Natural environments; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Potential risks; Root uptake; Soil plant systems; Translocation; Uptake; Biochemistry; organic carbon; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; bioaccumulation; bioavailability; chemical pollutant; hydrophobicity; rhizosphere; root system; soil pollution; soil quality; sorption; translocation; abiotic stress; absorption; apoplast; bioavailability; concentration (parameter); correlational study; hydrophobicity; hydroponics; lipid metabolism; nonhuman; pH; plant growth; plant metabolism; priority journal; protein metabolism; Review; rhizosphere microbiome; root growth; root respiration; soil change; soil pollution; soil temperature; symplast; ecosystem; human; plant; soil; soil pollutant; Microbiota; Ecosystem; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Plants; Soil; Soil Pollutants"

PFASs, such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and related precursors, have elicited attention from both public and national regulatory agencies, which has resulted in worldwide restrictions on their production and use. Apex predators occupy the top trophic positions in ecosystems and are most affected by the biomagnification behavior of PFASs. Meanwhile, the long lifespans of apex predators also lead to the high body burden of PFASs. The high body burden of PFASs might be linked to adverse health effects and even pose a potential threat to their reproduction. As seen in previous reviews of PFASs, knowledge is lacking between the current stage of the PFAS body burden and related effects in apex predators. This review summarized PFAS occurrence in global apex predators, including information on the geographic distribution, levels, profiles, and tissue distribution, and discussed the trophic transfer and ecotoxicity of PFASs.

GenX and PFOA have been detected in various natural water sources, and adsorption is recognized as a typical treatment process for PFOA removal. In this paper, comparisons of GenX and PFOA adsorption are evaluated, including adsorption potential, adsorption mechanisms, and associated costs. A detailed literature review suggests that anion-exchange resins are more effective in removing GenX than activated carbon. GenX removal efficiency through activated carbon (30%) is lower than that of PFOA (80–95%), while GenX and PFOA removal efficiencies by anion exchange resins are similar (99%). Unconventional adsorbents, such as ionic fluorogels and covalent organic frameworks can effectively remove GenX from water. The review reveals that GenX adsorption is more challenging, requiring almost 4 times the treatment cost of its predecessor, PFOA. Annual operation and maintenance costs for GenX adsorption (initial concentration of GenX and PFOA = 0.2 µg.L−1) by GAC for treating 10,000 m3 per day is almost US$1,000,000 per year, but only around US$240,000 per year for PFOA.

Providing sustainable and affordable treatment solutions to these problems is a need of the hour. Electrocoagulation (EC) technology is a burgeoning alternative for effective water treatment, which offers the virtues such as compact equipment, easy operation, and low sludge production. Compared to other water purification technologies, EC shows excellent removal efficacy for a wide range of contaminants in water and has great potential for addressing limitations of conventional water purification technologies. This review summarizes the latest development of principle, characteristics, and reactor design of EC. The design of key parameters including reactor shape, power supply type, current density, as well as electrode configuration is further elaborated. In particular, typical water treatment systems powered by renewable energy (solar photovoltaic and wind turbine systems) are proposed. Further, this review provides an overview on expanded application of EC in the removal of some newly concerned pollutants in recent years, including arsenite, perfluorinated compounds, pharmaceuticals, oil, bacteria, and viruses. The removal efficiency and mechanisms of these pollutants are also discussed. Finally, future research trend and focus are further recommended. This review can bridge the large knowledge gap for the EC application that is beneficial for environmental researchers and engineers. © 2021","bioreactor; coagulation; design; electrochemistry; electrode; pollutant removal; purification; water stress; water treatment; electrocoagulation; electrode; human; pollutant; technology; water management; water pollutant; Electrocoagulation; Electrodes; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Technology; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification"

This review presents the current state of knowledge on the metabolic pathways of NSAIDs in organisms at various levels of biological organisation. More than 150 publications dealing with target or non-target analysis of selected NSAIDs (mainly diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen) were collected. The metabolites of phase I and phase II are presented. The similarity of NSAIDs metabolism to that in mammals was observed in bacteria, microalgae, fungi, higher plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. The differences, such as newly detected metabolites, the extracellular metabolism observed in bacteria and fungi, or phase III metabolism in plants, are highlighted. Metabolites detected in plants (conjugates with sugars and amino acids) but not found in any other organisms are described. Selected, in-depth studies with isolated bacterial strains showed the possibility of transforming NSAIDs into assimilable carbon sources. It has been found that some of the metabolites show higher toxicity than their parent forms. The presence of metabolites of NSAIDs in the environment is the cumulative effect of their introduction with wastewaters, their formation in wastewater treatment plants, and their transformation by non-target wild-living organisms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic organisms; Bacteria; Biomolecules; Fungi; Mammals; Metabolites; Physiology; Soils; Wastewater treatment; 'current; Biotransformation product; Emerging pollutants; Exposed to; Living organisms; Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; Pharmaceutical metabolite; Pharmaceutical removal; Soil organisms; Trace level; Metabolism; 1,2,4 benzenetriol; amino acid; amitriptyline; anthranilic acid; anthranilic acid derivative; biosurfactant; carbohydrate; carboxylic acid; carotenoid; catalase; catechol 1,2 dioxygenase; catechol derivative; cytochrome P450 1A; cytochrome P450 1A1; cytochrome P450 2C; diclofenac; diflunisal; flurbiprofen; gentisic acid; glucoside; glutathione; glutathione reductase; glutathione transferase; ibuprofen; imipramine; indometacin; ketoprofen; laccase; levofloxacin; lignin; lignin peroxidase; mefenamic acid; muconic acid; naproxen; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; phenylacetic acid; protocatechuic acid; quercetin; reactive oxygen metabolite; salicylate sodium; superoxide dismutase; testosterone; drug; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; bacterium; biotransformation; drug; fungus; metabolism; nontarget organism; toxicity; wild population; Actinomyces; acute toxicity; Acutodesmus obliquus; Aliivibrio fischeri; aquatic environment; Arabidopsis thaliana; Bacillus subtilis; Bacillus thuringiensis; bacterial genome; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bioaccumulation; biodegradability; biodegradation; biofilm; bioremediation; biotransformation; Brevibacillus; carbon source; carboxylation; chemical mutagenesis; chemical oxygen demand; Chlorella sorokiniana; Chlorella vulgaris; Comamonadaceae; cyanobacterium; Daphnia magna; dealkylation; dechlorination; deoxygenation; dihydroxylation; Dreissena polymorpha; drug metabolism; EC50; ecotoxicity; enzyme activity; enzyme specificity; enzyme synthesis; filamentous fungus; Gammaproteobacteria; Gammarus pulex; gene expression; Geobacter metallireducens; glycosylation; high performance liquid chromatography; LC50; limit of detection; lipid peroxidation; liver injury; marine environment; metabolomics; methanogenesis; microbial community; microbial degradation; minimum inhibitory concentration; Mytilus galloprovincialis; Nicotiana tabacum; nonhuman; Oreochromis niloticus; oxidative stress; oxygen consumption; photosynthesis; phytotoxicity; proteomics; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Review; Rhodococcus erythropolis; risk assessment; Salmo trutta; soil pollution; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; Streptomyces griseus; toxicity testing; Trametes versicolor; ultra performance liquid chromatography; upregulation; vascular plant; waste water treatment plant; wild species; zebra fish; animal; Bacteria (microorganisms); Embryophyta; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Vertebrata; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Diclofenac; Ibuprofen; Naproxen; Pharmaceutical Preparations"

Several advisory guidelines were proposed worldwide aimed at limiting their occurrences in the aquatic environments, especially for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). This review paper aims to provide a holistic review in the emerging area of PFAS research by summarizing the spatiotemporal variations in PFAS concentrations in surface water systems globally, highlighting the possible trends of occurrences of PFAS, and presenting potential human health impacts as a result of PFAS exposure through surface water matrices. From the data analysis in this study, occurrences of PFOA and PFOS in many surface water matrices were observed to be several folds higher than the US EPA health advisory level of 70 ng/L for lifetime exposure from drinking water. Direct discharge and atmospheric deposition were identified as primary sources of PFAS in surface water and cryosphere, respectively. While global efforts focused on limiting usages of long-chain PFAS such as PFOS and PFOA, the practices of using short-chain PFAS such as perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and PFAS alternatives increased substantially.

Experimental studies along with quantitative structure activity/property relationship (QSAR/QSPR) models are used to determine the physiochemical properties of these contaminants. The estimated properties have been extensively used to predict environmental fate and transportation of chemicals. However, application of these QSAR/QSPR models in remediation technology design is not widely explored. In this review paper, we have shown that remediation parameters (e.g., dehalogenation rate constant) estimated by QSAR/QSPR models can inform the remediation technology design. For this purpose, we examined the state of knowledge on the development of QSAR/QSPR models for physiochemical properties estimation of two selected model compounds including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Molecular descriptors such as energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO), energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO), chlorine and fluorine number, molar volume (VM) and total surface area (TSA) are inputs of the QSAR/QSPR models that can be used for estimation of the remediation parameters. This approach is suitable to be applied at the initial stage of remediation process development, to further inform bench-scale, pilot-scale, and full-scale stages. The suggested approach can expedite remediation technology design for emerging contaminants or newly developed chemicals for which the knowledge about their fate and behaviour in the environment is limited. © 2021 The Author(s)",

Animal models for liver cancer are powerful tools to reach this goal. Over the past decade, our laboratory has established multiple oncogene transgenic zebrafish lines that can be robustly induced to develop liver cancer. Histolog-ical, transcriptomic and molecular analyses validate the use of these transgenic zebrafish as experimental models for liver cancer. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of our findings with these inducible zebrafish liver cancer models in tumour initiation, oncogene addiction, tumour microenvironment, gender disparity, cancer cachexia, drug screening and others. Induced oncogene expression causes a rapid change of the tumour microenvironment such as inflammatory responses, increased vascularisation and rapid hepatic growth. In several models, histologically-proven carcinoma can be induced within one week of chemical inducer administration. Interest-ingly, the induced liver tumours show the ability to regress when the transgenic oncogene is sup-pressed by the withdrawal of the chemical inducer. Like human liver cancer, there is a strong bias of liver cancer severity in male zebrafish. After long-term tumour progression, liver cancer-bearing zebrafish also show symptoms of cancer cachexia such as muscle-wasting. In addition, the zebrafish models have been used to screen for anti-metastasis drugs as well as to evaluate environmental toxicants in carcinogenesis. These findings demonstrated that these inducible zebrafish liver cancer models provide rapid and convenient experimental tools for further investigation of fundamental cancer biology, with the potential for the discovery of new therapeutic approaches. © 2021 by the authors.

We identified 454 relevant documents, of which 61 discussed the non-U.S. PFAS policy, 214 discussed the U.S. national-level PFAS policy, and 181 discussed the U.S. state-level PFAS policy. The drivers of and challenges to PFAS regulation were identified through qualitative analysis. The drivers of PFAS policy identified were political support for regulation, social awareness of PFAS, economic resource availability, and compelling scientific evidence. The challenges to implementing PFAS regulations were political limitations, economic challenges, unclear scientific evidence, and practical challenges.

In these types of systems, the anodic oxidation reaction is catalyzed by anaerobic microorganisms, while the cathodic reduction reaction can be carried out biotically or abiotically. Membranes as separators in MFCs are the primary requirements for optimal electrochemical and microbiological performance. MFC configuration and operation are similar to those of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs)—both having at least one anode and one cathode split by a membrane or separator. The Nafion® 117 (NF-117) membrane, made from perfluorosulfonic acid, is a membrane used as a separator in PEMFCs. By analogy of the operation between electrochemical systems and MFCs, NF-117 membranes have been widely used as separators in MFCs. The main disadvantage of this type of membrane is its high cost; membranes in MFCs can represent up to 60% of the MFC’s total cost. This is one of the challenges in scaling up MFCs: finding alternative membranes or separators with low cost and good electrochemical characteristics. The aim of this work is to critically review state-of-the-art membranes and separators used in MFCs. The scope of this review includes: (i) membrane functions in MFCs, (ii) most-used membranes, (iii) membrane cost and efficiency, and (iv) membrane-less MFCs. Currently, there are at least 20 different membranes or separators proposed and evaluated for MFCs, from basic salt bridges to advanced synthetic polymer-based membranes, including ceramic and unconventional separator materials. Studies focusing on either low cost or the use of natural polymers for proton-exchange membranes (PEM) are still scarce. Alternatively, in some works, MFCs have been operated without membranes; however, significant decrements in Coulombic efficiency were found. As the type of membrane affects the performance and total cost of MFCs, it is recommended that research efforts are increased in order to develop new, more economic membranes that exhibit favorable properties and allow for satisfactory cell performance at the same time. The current state of the art of membranes for MFCs addressed in this review will undoubtedly serve as a key insight for future research related to this topic. © 2021 by the authors.

Although it has been known since 1975, the chemistry of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones has recently only received great attention from the scientific community. Generally, they are used as either safe and bench-stable diazo precursors in carbene transfer reactions or as 1,3-dipoles in cycloaddition and cyclization reactions. Notably, fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones to replace toxic fluoroalkyl diazo compounds in carbene transfer reactions reduce the risk of rapid accumulation of explosive diazo compounds and improve functional group compatibility and substrate scope. Given the growing importance of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones in chemical synthesis, a comprehensive review of this topic in the literature is essential to demonstrate their synthetic potential.

The prevalence of allergic diseases in childhood is gradually increasing all over the world in recent decades. Known causes of these diseases include anomalous immune responses and allergic inflammatory reactions, but the causes of allergic diseases in childhood are complex. Data sources: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Science were searched for articles focusing on environmental exposure during pregnancy and the risk of childhood allergic diseases, including asthma and atopic dermatitis, and the possible underlying mechanism. Results: In terms of environmental factors, allergic diseases in childhood are closely related to environmental chemical exposure during pregnancy, including bisphenols, phthalates acid esters, perfluorochemicals, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and polychlorinated biphenyls. However, allergic diseases in childhood are also closely associated with maternal dietary nutrition, maternal intake of drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), paracetamol and antibiotics, and maternal lifestyle. Conclusions: Several harmful environmental factors during pregnancy can result in the interruption of the function of helper T cells (Th1/Th2), cytokines and immunoglobulins and may activate allergic reactions, which can lead to allergic diseases during childhood. © 2021, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; acetylsalicylic acid; antibiotic agent; environmental chemical; ester; paracetamol; phthalic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; allergic disease; asthma; atopic dermatitis; blood placenta barrier; childhood disease; dietary exposure; environmental exposure; environmental factor; epigenetic modification; human; lifestyle; maternal exposure; maternal nutrition; persistent organic pollutant; pregnancy; prenatal drug exposure; Review; social aspect; adverse event; asthma; atopic dermatitis; diet; environmental exposure; female; hypersensitivity; pregnancy; Asthma; Dermatitis, Atopic; Diet; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Pregnancy"

GQDs exhibit the phenomena of quantum confinement and edge effects; this phenomenon bestows them with exceptional physico-chemical properties. These features have made GQDs suitable materials for application in the catalytic removal of organic pollutants and dyes, adsorption of heavy metals, filtration of organic pollutants and in the disinfection of microbes. However, challenges encountered when developing GQDs for environmental applications include generating high-quality QDs and devising large scale synthetic procedures that ensure reproducible size distribution. A need exists for theoretical and practical research on the development of novel methods that allows high yields and easy purification of GQDs to be achieved. In addition, despite possible mechanisms having been proposed, a lack of an understanding of the photoluminescence (PL) properties of GQDs remains. This review focuses on some of the research that was reported on GQDs during in the past 20 years. The significant findings are summarized with comparative and balanced views. The emphasis is placed on the different synthetic routes for accessing GQDs and as well as the unique properties, which make GQDs ideal candidates for the removal of emerging pollutants from wastewater. An evaluation of the most used approaches and promising technologies for the removal of emerging pollutants using GQDs is also presented.

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overview of these associations. Methods: The online databases PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched comprehensively for eligible studies from inception to February 2021. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random- or fixed-effects models, and dose-response meta-analyses were also conducted when possible. Findings: A total of 29 studies (32,905 participants) were included. The pooled results demonstrated that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure during pregnancy was linearly associated with increased preterm birth risk (pooled OR per 1-ng/ml increase: 1.01, 95% CIs: 1.00–1.02, P = 0.009) and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) exposure showed inverted U-shaped associations with preterm birth risk (P values for the nonlinear trend: 0.025 and 0.030). Positive associations were also observed for exposure to perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) and miscarriage (pooled OR per 1-ng/ml increase: 1.87, 95% CIs: 1.15–3.03) and PFOS and preeclampsia (pooled OR per 1-log increase: 1.27, 95% CIs: 1.06–1.51), whereas exposure to perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA) was inversely associated with preeclampsia risk (pooled OR per 1-log increase: 0.81, 95% CIs: 0.71–0.93). Based on individual evidence, detrimental effects were observed between PFDA exposure and small for gestational age and between PFOA and PFOS and intrauterine growth restriction. No significant associations were found between pregnancy PFAS exposure and other adverse pregnancy outcomes (i.e., gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced hypertension, low birth weight, and large and small for gestational age). Interpretation: Our findings indicated that PFOS, PFOA and PFNA exposure during pregnancy might be associated with increased preterm birth risk and that PFAS exposure might be associated with the risk of miscarriage and preeclampsia. Due to the limited evidence obtained for most associations, additional studies are required to confirm these findings. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","n methyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide acetate; organofluorine derivative; perfluoroalkanoic acid; perfluorobutane sulfonate; perfluorobutanoate; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctane sulfonamide; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoropentanoate; perfluorotetradecanoate; perfluorotridecanoate; perfluoroundecanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; sulfonamide; sulfonic acid derivative; toxic substance; unclassified drug; chemical substance; concentration (composition); diabetes; health risk; literature review; meta-analysis; pollution exposure; pregnancy; risk factor; adolescent; adult; adverse outcome; case control study; cohort analysis; disease association; Embase; environmental exposure; evidence based practice; female; fetus outcome; high risk pregnancy; human; intrauterine growth retardation; large for gestational age; low birth weight; maternal blood; maternal exposure; maternal hypertension; Medline; mother; newborn disease; nonlinear system; observational study; preeclampsia; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; prenatal exposure; progeny; Review; risk factor; small for date infant; spontaneous abortion; systematic review; trend study; Web of Science; meta analysis; newborn; pregnancy; prematurity; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Premature Birth"

The search for cost-effective and environmental-friendly bio-jet fuels derived from natural resources is gaining momentum. The microalgae cultivation conditions including temperature, pH, light intensity and nutrients have shown significant influence on the microalgae growth rate and chemical composition, which create the opportunities to enhance the yield and quality of microalgae bio-jet fuel. This review is focused on the hydroprocessing method for converting microalgae oil into bio-jet fuel, as well as the novel conceptual approaches for bio-jet fuel production such as gasification with Fischer-Tropsch and sugar-to-jet. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of biomass is one of the best alternative ways to replace natural aviation fuel due to the high maximum energy efficiency and low emission of greenhouse gas. In addition, hydroprocessing with the aid of Ni and zeolites catalysts has successfully converted the microalgae biodiesel to bio-jet fuel with high yield and alkane selectivity. Among these techniques, hydroprocessing used the lowest production cost with the longest duration, whereas the bio-jet fuel with high selectivity (C8–C16) could be produced by using gasification with the Fischer-Tropsch process. Consequently, gasification and Fischer-Tropsch and sugar-to-jet can become the future alternative process to convert microalgae to bio-jet fuel. The development of microalgae bio-jet fuel will increase the security of energy supply and reduce the fuel expenses in aviation industry. © 2021","Biofuels; Biomass; Catalyst selectivity; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Gasification; Greenhouse gases; Microalgae; Microorganisms; Productivity; Aviation energy; Aviation sector; Bio-jet fuel; Bio-mass energy; Energy; Fischer Tropsch; Fuel production; Gasification fischer-topsch; Hydroprocessing; Micro-algae; Jet fuel"

The primary function of a membrane in VRFBs is to control proton transport between the half-cells and to hinder admixing the anolyte and catholyte at the same time. However, to develop a low-cost and energy-efficient VRFB, other membrane roles are crucial. The combination of a highly stable backbone of polytetrafluoroethylene with hydrophilic perfluorinated-vinyl-polyether side chains equipped with sulfonic acid groups (Nafion membranes) has led to a breakthrough in the field. However, suffering from high cost and low selectivity, these perflurinated membranes are not properly qualified for VRFBs. Sulfonation of aromatic hydrocarbon polymers is suggested as cost-effective alternative chemistry for VRFBs’ membrane design. Further tunning the performance of the membrane and VRFB is obtained through designing their microstructure by different tools, especially adjusting the degree of sulfonation and degree of branching, utilizing additional membrane layers, and incorporation of particles in the polymer matrix. In this review, the studies performed to develop membranes for VRFBs are discussed as a road map for the development of advanced membranes qualified for VRFBs. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Aromatic hydrocarbons; Aromatic polymers; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Flow batteries; Sulfonation; Vanadium; Degree of branching; Degree of sulfonation; Energy efficient; Membrane designs; Primary functions; Proton transport; Sulfonic acid groups; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Ion selective membranes"

Hypogonadism can be caused by testicular disease (primary hypogonadism) or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (secondary hypogonadism). The present strategy for treating hypogonadism is the administration of exogenous testosterone. But exogenous testosterone is reported to have negative side effects including adverse cardiovascular events and disruption of physiological spermatogenesis probably due to its inability to mimic the physiological circadian rhythm of testosterone secretion in vivo. In recent years, a growing number of articles demonstrated that stem Leydig cells (SLCs) can not only differentiate into functional Leydig cells (LCs) in vivo to replace chemically disrupted LCs, but also secrete testosterone in a physiological pattern. The proliferation and differentiation of SLCs are regulated by various factors. However, the mechanisms involved in regulating the development of SLCs remain to be summarized. Factors involved in the regulation of SLCs can be divided into environmental pollutants, growth factors, cytokine and hormones. Environmental pollutants such as Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and Triphenyltin (TPT) could suppress SLCs proliferation or differentiation. Growth factors including FGF1, FGF16, NGF and activin A are essential for the maintenance of SLCs self-renewal and differentiation. Interleukin 6 family could inhibit differentiation of SLCs. Among hormones, dexamethasone suppresses SLCs differentiation, while aldosterone suppresses their proliferation. The present review focuses on new progress about factors regulating SLC’s proliferation and differentiation which will undoubtedly deepen our insights into SLCs and help make better clinical use of them.

That is, especially in countries where an abundance of chemicals called endocrine disruptors has repeatedly been reported, both in the environment and in human matrices. Human exposure to persistent and non-persistent chemicals is ubiquitous and associated with endocrine-disrupting effects. This group of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) can act as agonists or antagonists of hormone receptors and can thus significantly affect a number of physiological processes. It can even negatively affect human reproduction with an impact on the development of gonads and gametogenesis, fertilization, and the subsequent development of embryos. The negative effects of endocrine disruptors on sperm gametogenesis and male fertility in general have been investigated and repeatedly demonstrated in experimental and epidemiological studies. Male reproduction is affected by endocrine disruptors via their effect on testicular development, impact on estrogen and androgen receptors, potential epigenetic effect, production of reactive oxygen species or direct effect on spermatozoa and other cells of testicular tissue. Emerging scientific evidence suggests that the increasing incidence of male infertility is associated with the exposure to persistent and non-persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as bisphenols and perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFAS). These chemicals may impact men’s fertility through various mechanisms. This study provides an overview of the mechanisms of action common to persistent (PFAS) and nonpersistent (bisphenols) EDC on male fertility. © Copyright © 2021 Ješeta, Navrátilová, Franzová, Fialková, Kempisty, Ventruba, Žáková and Crha.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; androstanolone; endocrine disruptor; estrogen receptor; gonadotropin; luteinizing hormone; perfluoroalkyl substance; pregnenolone; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; acrosome; apoptosis; biosynthesis; biotransformation; blood testis barrier; cell membrane permeability; DNA damage; DNA fragmentation; DNA methylation; drug mechanism; epigenetics; exposure; gametogenesis; histone methylation; human; male; male fertility; nonhuman; oxidative stress; phosphorylation; reproduction; Review; spermatozoon; spermatozoon motility; steroidogenesis; testis development"

Besides conventional strategies, i.e., nucleophilic and electrophilic alkynylation, SOMOphilic alkynylation has become one of the most straightforward and powerful methods to construct C(sp)-C bonds. This review focuses on the recent developments in the transformations of acetylenic sulfones through a well-known radical addition ensuring C-SO2 bond cleavage relay (α-addition-β-elimination process), where acetylenic sulfones serve as either mono- or multi-functional reagents. In this regard, acetylenic sulfones can directly react with diverse alkyl radical species for the preparation of synthetically useful internal alkynes. On the other hand, acetylenic sulfones undergo a sequence of radical relays including hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), rearrangement, cyclization, SO2 capture, etc. for the simultaneous incorporation of alkynyl and other functionalities. Considering the different reaction modes, these contents employing acetylenic sulfones as functional reagents are divided into four sections: (1) direct alkynylation with various C-centered radicals; (2) alkynylation and fluoroalkylation; (3) alkynylation and sulfonylation; and (4) alkynylation and in situ SO2 capture.

We conclude the review by identifying challenges and opportunities with an emphasis on approaches for exceeding the product distribution limit, suppressing the catalyst deactivation, and improving the feasibility of low-pressure operation by continuous consumption of key intermediates. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",

Ubiquitous exposures to PFAS, in consideration of their persistence, bioaccumulation potential, and toxicities have led to concerns regarding possible harmful effects during critical periods of development in early-life and long-term consequences on health. The potential effects of PFAS depend on various factors including the type of PFAS and the timing and level of exposure. We performed a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature to assess the effects of early-life PFAS exposure on prenatal and postnatal growth, adiposity, and puberty in children and adolescents. For birth size, most studies indicated that prenatal PFAS exposure, in particular long-chain PFAS, may impair fetal growth, albeit some reports of null associations with maternal PFAS. For growth within 2 years of age, prenatal PFAS exposure showed no associations with height and either null or negative associations with weight. However, postnatal PFAS exposures were inversely related to height and weight at 2 years in a cross-sectional study. For postnatal adiposity, prenatal PFAS may mostly have negative associations with body mass index in the first 2 years of life, but positive relationships with adiposity in childhood and adolescence, although some studies showed null associations. For puberty, the evidence for associations between early-life PFAS exposure and pubertal development or sex hormone levels were limited and inconclusive. From experimental studies, plausible mechanisms through which PFAS may affect early-life growth and puberty include PFAS-induced activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, alterations of thyroid or steroid hormone synthesis and metabolism, and their weak estrogenic or anti-androgenic properties. Although the published literature suggests possible effects of PFAS exposures on early-life growth, adiposity, and puberty, current human evidence is limited in establishing PFAS-induced effects on early-life physical development. Further investigation is warranted to clarify PFAS-induced effects on growth and physical development in consideration of the critical time-window of exposure, concomitant exposure to chemical mixtures including various PFAS types, and possible non-monotonic dose-response relationship for growth and adiposity trajectories. © Copyright © 2021 Lee, Jung, Kim, Choi and Lee.","alkyl group; estradiol; follitropin; luteinizing hormone; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; polyfluoroalkyl substance; steroid hormone; testosterone; thyroid hormone; unclassified drug; bioaccumulation; birth length; birth weight; body fat; body height; body mass; body weight; childhood obesity; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; environmental exposure; fetus growth; fluorination; gestational age; hormone metabolism; hormone synthesis; human; long term exposure; menarche; meta analysis; physical parameters; ponderal index; postnatal growth; precocious puberty; prenatal exposure; Review; risk assessment; skinfold thickness; systematic review; waist circumference; waist to height ratio"

In this review, reactions of allenes with boron-based Lewis acids, especially such ones equipped with perfluorophenyl rings, are discussed. It is shown that depending on the substitution pattern of the allene and the borane, a surprisingly broad variety of chemical transformations can be observed. These transformations often include unexpected skeletal rearrangements of the former allene. Furthermore, some transformations require only catalytic amounts of the borane-based Lewis acid. Within this minireview, emphasis is given to the mechanistic aspects of these transformations, and similarities in the initial reaction steps are outlined. © 2021 The Authors.

Compounds such as perfluoroalkylated arenes and heteroarenes have found uses in surfactants, lubricants, and flame retardants as a result of their astonishing chemical stability. Consequently, the synthesis of such compounds encompasses a large body of scientific articles and patents developed in the previous century. Most recent reviews on this subject have thus focused on summarizing this traditional literature, and have thereby spurred the development of a new wave of reaction manifolds employing modern synthesis principles. This new generation of methodologies focuses on the greener synthesis of perfluoroalkylated aromatic scaffolds, through the use of more efficient organometallic reactions, as well as by photochemical and electrochemical strategies.

Yet, the contribution of suspended particles has not been systematically reviewed. Analyzing reported studies, we quantitatively demonstrate that suspended particles in surface water can contain significantly higher concentrations of PFAAs than the sediment below, indicating the source of suspended particles are not the sediment but particles eroded and carried from the source zone upstream. The affinity of PFAAs to particles depends on the particle composition, including organic carbon fraction and iron or aluminum oxide content. In soils, most PFAAs are retained within the top 5 m below the ground surface. The distribution of PFAAs in the subsurface varies based on site properties and local weather conditions. The depth corresponding to the maximum concentration of PFAA in soil decreases with an increase in soil organic carbon or rainfall amount received in the catchment areas. We attribute a greater accumulation of PFAAs near the upper layer of the subsurface to an increase in the accumulation of particles eroded from source zones upstream receiving heavy rainfall. Precursor transformation in the aerobic zone is significantly higher than in the anaerobic zone, thereby making the aerobic subsurface zone serve as a long-term source of groundwater pollution. Collectively, these results suggest that suspended particles, often an overlooked vector for PFAAs, can be a dominant pathway for the transport of PFAAs in environments. © 2021 The Authors","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Catchments; Colloids; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Iron oxides; Rain; River pollution; Soil pollution; Soils; Surface waters; Suspended sediments; Perfluoroalkyl acids; PFAS transport; Rainfall intensity; Soil organic carbon; Source zone; Subsurface leaching; Subsurface soil; Surface runoffs; Suspended particles; Transport pathways; Organic carbon; ground water; iron oxide; organic carbon; rain; surface water; carbon; fluorocarbon; ground water; aluminum oxide; chemical compound; concentration (composition); pollutant transport; runoff; soil pollution; surface water; suspended particulate matter; catchment area; colloid; controlled study; maximum concentration; mineralogy; particle resuspension; Review; runoff; soil; surface runoff; weathering; environmental monitoring; soil; water pollutant; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Groundwater; Soil; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Initial biological studies found that vinigrol possesses both antihypertensive and platelet aggregation-inhibitory properties. More recent studies have identified vinigrol as a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist. In addition, vinigrol has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and inflammation. Structurally, the 1,5-butanodecahydronaphthalene core with eight contiguous stereocenters located in vinigrol represents the unprecedented and unique motif found in natural product small molecules. This promising biological activities of vinigrol combined with its unique terpene framework have attracted significant attention from the synthetic community. However, the total synthesis of vinigrol has been regarded as one of the most challenging tasks in the synthesis community for more than two decades. Numerous research efforts have been oriented toward the total synthesis of vinigrol, including Paquette, Corey, Hanna and other groups before 2008. Until now, four elegant total syntheses have been reported. In 2009, Baran and co-workers completed the first total synthesis of (±)-vinigrol, and the challenging 1,5-butanodecahydronaphthalene core was constructed by a way of intermolecular Diels-Alder and intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions followed by Grob fragmentation. Key salient features including an unusual dipolar cycloaddition for establishing the cis-orientation of the C8-methyl and C8a-hydroxy groups, and a later stage of Shapiro reaction via the tri-anionic species to deliver the final target. The synthesis was completed in a 23-step route with 3% overall yield from commercially available materials. This work represented a landmark achievement in the vinigrol synthesis. In 2013, Njardarson and co-workers completed another remarkable total synthesis of (±)-vinigrol, and the challenging 1,5-butanodecahydronaphthalene core was established with an elegant oxidative dearomatization/intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction followed by a Wharton fragmentation. In 2019, Luo and co-workers reported the first asymmetric total synthesis of (-)-vinigrol, with an impressive transannular Diels-Alder reaction as the key step. This scalable synthesis of (-)-vinigrol was completed in a 20-step route with 1.4% overall yield from commercially available materials, and provided over 600 mg of natural product in one operation. It should be noted that the Diels-Alder reaction was a crucial element in the synthetic strategy toward vinigrol in all these noteworthy achievements. Later, our group reported another asymmetric total synthesis of (-)-vinigrol using a unique Type II [5+2] cycloaddition and a novel ring contraction cascade as the key reactions. This synthetic work represents the first example of an intramolecular [5+2] cycloaddition to construct eight-membered ring system in natural product synthesis. Furthermore, the linear sequence of our concise asymmetric total synthesis of (-)-vinigrol was only 14 steps from commercially available material and without the need for protecting groups during the whole synthesis. The goal of this review is to provide a survey of advances in the total synthesis of vinigrol and discuss the synthetic strategies and tactics in each synthesis. The authors also hope that this review will serve a useful guidance for organic chemists who involved in total synthesis of natural products and provide a stimulus for inventions and further advances in this exciting area. © 2021, Science Press.

However, no study has reviewed this topic. This study reviewed the effects of different frying processes on the nutritional and sensory characteristics of mackerel, with and without batter, marinade, and spice. MEDLINE, Web of Science, PubMed, and ScienceDirect were used as online databases to find relevant articles. We found that the nutritional, physicochemical, and sensory properties of fried mackerel without treatment were influenced by frying methods. Deep frying affected the oxidation of lipids and degradation of proteins, while air frying increased the overall acceptance score. Frying can reduce perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), eliminate some toxins, lower the trypsin inhibitor (TI), and increase the sensory parameters of mackerel with batter, marinade, and spice treatment. The different ingredients of minced mackerel products preserved their nutritional and sensory parameters after frying. Interestingly, vacuum frying resulted in lower oxidation and maintenance of nutritional and sensory parameters of fried mackerel (with or without treatment) and minced mackerel products. Further research is needed to reveal the effectiveness of vacuum frying in maintaining the nutritional and sensory properties of fried and minced mackerel products. © 2021 by the authors.

While UV radiation could be directly employed for decontamination, there are nevertheless considerable problems regarding its use, even from a large-scale perspective. In contrast, the use of cheap, robust, and green photocatalytic materials active under near UV-visible radiation shows interesting prospects.

After a systematic review, a total of 19 peer-reviewed papers published between 2000 and 2020 were retained to evaluate the antioxidant effects of PFA compared to synthetic antioxidant vitamins (mainly vitamin E; VitE) in livestock nutrition. These studies demonstrated that PFAs could be as efficient as VitE in counteracting oxidative stress in pigs, rabbits, and ruminants. However, PFAs only positively affected animals’ growth performance and feed efficiency in some monogastric studies. The PFA can affect antioxidant enzyme activity in a dose-and method of administration-dependent manner. The antioxidant capacity of both PFA and VitE were depressed in cows fed with diets rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Variability among studies could be related to species differences. Despite the interest of the feed industry sector in PFA, there are still very few studies evaluating their antioxidant effect in species other than poultry. © 2021 by the authors.

Lancet (2016); 388: 3027–35 and Callaghan et al. Pediatrics (2006);118: 1566–73. Despite advances in prenatal care, prematurity remains a persistent clinical problem, with 1 in 8 births occurring prematurely (prior to 37 weeks of gestation) in the USA as discussed by Frey and Klebanoff Semin Fetal Neonatal Med (2016);21: 68–73,. Advances in neonatology including gentle ventilation strategies, permissive hypercapnia, and the use of corticosteroids have led to substantial improvements in survival; however, long-term survivors of preterm birth face considerable morbidities affecting every major organ system. Chronic lung disease represents one of the most common and significant long-term complications of preterm birth and is attributable largely to iatrogenic injury due to the underdeveloped nature of the alveoli and lack of compliance of the immature lung as stated by Behrman and Butler (2007). Conventional gas-based ventilation of the premature lung leads to barotrauma, inflammation, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) as discussed by Sinha and Donn Semin Fetal Neonatal Med (2006);11: 166–73. Recent Findings: Since the discovery of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) over 70 years ago, liquid ventilation has been examined as a viable alternative to conventional gas-based mechanical ventilation in a variety of disease models, including that of extreme prematurity. PFCs are biologically inert organofluorine compounds with remarkably high gas dissolving properties due to weak intermolecular attractive forces, allowing dissolution of up to twenty times the amount of oxygen and three times the amount of carbon dioxide than water as discussed by Wesseler, Iltis, and Clark J Fluor Chem. Elsevier Sequoia S.A (1977);9: 137–46. These compounds have low surface tension, have low viscosity, are relatively dense, and have low vapor pressure (11–85 torr), permitting rapid evaporation from the lungs. One perfluorocarbon liquid of particular clinical interest is perflubron, a PFC with a bromine substituted for a primary fluorine. This compound has been used as a contrast medium and is radiographically opaque, allowing clinicians to examine lung filling in real time according to the study of Kazerooni et al. Radiology (1962);198: 137–42. Initial studies of liquid ventilation have shown increased gas exchange and alveoli recruitment, in addition to the return to fluid-filled physiology similar to that experienced during gestation, as discussed by Kylstram et al. Trans Am SOC Artif Intern Organs (1962;8: 378–83, Clark and Gollan (1966), and Schoenfisch Anid and Kylstra J Appl Physiol (1973);35: 117–21, leading to the identification of liquid ventilation as a promising intervention to support critically preterm infants.

Over recent years, the question of concrete mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory properties of bifidobacteria has been addressed in both animal and human studies. A possible candidate for this role has been discovered recently. The PFNA cluster, consisting of five core genes, pkb2, fn3, aaa-atp, duf58, tgm, has been found in all gut-dwelling autochthonous bifidobacterial species of humans. The sensory region of the species-specific serine-threonine protein kinase (PKB2), the transmembrane region of the microbial transglutaminase (TGM), and the type-III fibronectin domain-containing protein (FN3) encoded by the I gene imply that the PFNA cluster might be implicated in the interaction between bacteria and the host immune system. Moreover, the FN3 protein encoded by one of the genes making up the PFNA cluster, contains domains and motifs of cytokine receptors capable of selectively binding TNF-α. The PFNA cluster could play an important role for sensing signals of the immune system. Among the practical implications of this finding is the creation of anti-inflammatory drugs aimed at alleviating cytokine storms, one of the dire consequences resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2021 by the authors.

It has been used in a wide range of industrial and consumer products for decades. The unique properties of PFOS, including its stability and resistance to degradation, have made it highly persistent in the aquatic environment. Because of its persistence, potential toxicity, and occurrence in aquatic ecosystems, interest in PFOS has increased in recent decades. Despite this interest, current information on the environmental distribution of PFOS in ambient surface waters of the United States is fairly limited. This critical review summarizes the currently available literature on PFOS occurrence in surface waters across the United States and highlights existing data gaps. Available data are largely from a handful of study areas with known PFAS manufacturing or industrial uses, with much of the data collected from freshwater systems in eastern states and the upper Midwest. Measured PFOS concentrations in surface waters vary widely, over 8 orders of magnitude, with the highest concentrations occurring downstream from manufacturing and industrial use plants, areas near aqueous film-forming foam–use sites, and sites where PFOS precursors were used in textile treatment. Non–point source–related occurrences are highest near urbanized areas with high population densities. Current data illustrate the occurrence of PFOS in surface waters across multiple US states. Additional data are needed to better understand PFOS occurrence in US aquatic ecosystems, particularly in estuarine and marine systems and where monitoring data are not available (e.g., southwestern, central, and western United States). Additional PFOS occurrence data would provide valuable information on potential spatial and temporal variability in surface waters and possible risks posed to aquatic ecosystems.

Biomolecular emergence scenarios have proliferated in the literature but accounting for the ubiquity of oxidized (+ 5) phosphate (PO43−) in extant biochemistries has been challenging due to the dearth of phosphate and molecular oxygen on the primordial Earth. A compelling body of work suggests that exogenous schreibersite ((Fe,Ni)3P) was delivered to Earth via meteorite impacts during the Heavy Bombardment (ca. 4.1–3.8 Gya) and there converted to reduced P oxyanions (e.g., phosphite (HPO32−) and hypophosphite (H2PO2−)) and phosphonates. Inspired by this idea, we review the relevant literature to deduce a plausible reduced phospholipid analog of modern phosphatidylcholines that could have emerged in a primordial hydrothermal setting. A shallow alkaline lacustrine basin underlain by active hydrothermal fissures and meteoritic schreibersite-, clay-, and metal-enriched sediments is envisioned. The water column is laden with known and putative primordial hydrothermal reagents. Small system dimensions and thermal- and UV-driven evaporation further concentrate chemical precursors. We hypothesize that a reduced phospholipid arises from Fischer–Tropsch-type (FTT) production of a C8 alkanoic acid, which condenses with an organophosphinate (derived from schreibersite corrosion to hypophosphite with subsequent methylation/oxidation), to yield a reduced protophospholipid. This then condenses with an α-amino nitrile (derived from Strecker-type reactions) to form the polar head. Preliminary modeling results indicate that reduced phospholipids do not aggregate rapidly; however, single layer micelles are stable up to aggregates with approximately 100 molecules. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","evaporation; meteorite; modeling; phospholipid; phosphorite; phosphorus; phosphate; phospholipid; phosphorus; astronomy; Earth, Planet; Meteoroids; Phosphates; Phospholipids; Phosphorus"

With the emergence and development of miniaturized and portable devices in numerous scientific and technological fields, there has been an urgent need for on-chip FTSs due to their benefits of small size, portability, low energy consumption, and robustness. However, the small size of on-chip FTSs hinders the acquisition of a large optical path difference, resulting in a low resolution of the spectrometer. In addition, the sampler spacing is not sufficiently small to satisfy Nyquist's sampling theorem, directly influencing the bandwidth of the spectrometer. Therefore, studies have been performed to investigate the trade-off between the reduced size and performance of spectrometers. This paper aims to systematically review the progress in on-chip FTSs, especially in on-chip static FTSs, including spatially modulated, temporally modulated, and space-time comodulated FTSs, from the aspects of theories, implementations, and performance indicators. Finally, the paper ends with a discussion of the challenges and a view of the prospective development of this exciting field. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Bolometers; Chemical analysis; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Spectrometers; Analytical instrument; Constituent elements; Fourier transform spectrometers; Low energy consumption; Optical path difference; Performance indicators; Sampling theorems; Spatially modulated; Spacecraft instruments"

Among many technologies, adsorption has proven to be an effective and inexpensive technique for water and wastewater treatment. Biochar has been identified as a promising and low-cost material, which can be produced from various carbonaceous materials with different origins, compositions, and processing methods. Consequently, the interaction between biochars and adsorbate species is not simple and may involve different adsorption mechanisms, such as van der Waals forces, electrostatic interactions, surface complexation, ion-exchange, hydrophobic interactions, π-interactions, co-precipitation, partition, and pore-filling. In addition, many operating conditions can affect the performance of adsorption processes. However, the development of biochars as competitive adsorbent materials depends on standardization, continuous-supply, application, and regulation.

The technology as an alternative to existing energy and chemical intensive treatments has attained maturity for treating contaminants from range of waste streams, under wide range of climates and conditions. Recent trend shows additional research interventions for better expansion of the technology such as energy harvesting to make the system a net energy producer by coupling CW to microbial fuel cell (CW-MFC) and improved operation under climatically challenged condition. The assessment discusses treatment efficiency, bioelectricity production, improved electrode efficiency, performance variation w.r.t. Macrophyte, emerging pollutant removal and microbial community structure in CW-MFC, which reveal that carefully designed integrated CW-MFC with optimized system elements (electrode, spacing, separator, macrophyte, C source, rhizosphere microbes) are necessary for its more profitable futuristic application. Further, low temperature challenges of the technology and the strategies to achieve satisfactory low temperature performance were assessed. Successful implementation of the technology in cold climate calls for design of CW with incorporation of appropriate heat preservation method, active macrophyte or microbial consortia to work effectively under low temperature. Comparative evaluation of the technology with other treatment processes using Life cycle assessment (LCA) with cradle to grave approach (considering alternative substrates, energy harvesting, macrophyte use and disposal options) would further boost the technology penetration.

Lubricant not only minimizes the friction and wear but also dissipates the heat generated due to friction and removes debris from the area of contact. Environmental concerns, decreasing mineral oil reserves and difficult disposal of nonbiodegradable conventional lubricants have urged the researchers to shift towards environmental-friendly lubricants. Number of tribological studies carried out in the past have proved that ionic liquid-based bio-lubricants are sustainable and biodegradable alternative to mineral oils. This paper presents a brief review of properties of ionic liquids and their ability to reduce friction and wear between the interacting surfaces. Tribological performance and compatibility of ionic liquids with various base-oils have been compared under boundary lubrication. The results reveal that phosphonium-based ionic liquids namely tetra-decyl tri-hexyl phosphonium bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl) phosphinate (P66614)i(C8)2PO2 and tri-hexyl tetra-decyl phosphonium bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (P-DEHP) are more suitable for tribological applications.

Previous epidemiological studies suggest association of maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes, while evidences about the association are inconsistent. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the relationship of maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Twenty-one relevant studies were identified from three databases before 2020. The quality, heterogeneity and possibility of publication bias of included studies were evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, Q-statistic and Begg's test, respectively. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained by means of random-effects meta-analysis models. Meta-analysis results revealed that maternal exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) may have a positive association with preterm birth (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.38). The pooled estimates also showed limited evidence of association between maternal perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure and miscarriage (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 0.92, 2.38) with obvious heterogeneity (I2 = 93.9, p &lt; 0.01). However, no such significant associations were found between the other PFASs and miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth. In addition, the subgroup analyses showed that studies on the relationship of maternal PFASs exposure and miscarriage were mainly contributed by developed countries. The meta-analysis results indicated maternal exposure to PFOS can increase the risk of preterm birth. The results of the included studies are inconsistent and the effects of PFASs on human health are complex.

The immunotoxicity of these environmental toxicants are well acknowledged and a few studies have focused on the relationship between environmental toxicant exposure and vaccine antibody potency or immunoglobulin (Ig) levels in children. Altered antibody titers or Ig levels in post-vaccination children were correlated with these environmental exposures; however, the effects of environmental toxicants on post-vaccination antibody potency or Ig levels in children have not been summarized. The objectives of this systematic review are therefore 1) to summarize the current studies concerning the associations of early-life exposure to environmental toxicants with vaccine antibody potency or Ig levels in children; and 2) to analyze the possible mechanisms underlying exposure-related alterations of antibody titers or Ig levels against different vaccines. We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database for relevant literature with the key terms and included articles up to September 30, 2020. Based on the eligibility criteria, 28 articles were selected. These studies investigated the associations of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (5 studies), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) (6 studies), other OPs (4 studies), heavy metals (11 studies) and air pollutants, e.g. PM2.5, (3 studies) with the serum-specific antibody concentrations or Ig levels against different vaccines, such as anti-Hib, tetanus, diphtheria toxoid, IgA, IgE, etc. These studies suggest that exposure to these toxicants is generally associated with decreased potency of antibodies produced from childhood immunizations and overall deficiency in vaccines' provided protection. This systematic review provides evidence that exposure-induced changes to humoral immune-related tissue/cells/molecules response to vaccines may play predominant roles in the inverse associations between antibody responsiveness to vaccines and environmental toxicants. This review could thus also help us to conduct better immunization policies for children under environmental toxicant burdens. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Health risks; Heavy metals; Immunization; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Vaccines; Air pollutants; Antibody titers; Child; Children's health; Earliest life; Early-life exposure; Environmental toxicants; Immunoglobulin level; Organics; Systematic Review; Antibodies; diphtheria toxoid; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin E; perfluoro compound; polychlorinated biphenyl; antibody; child health; concentration (composition); immunization; pollution exposure; toxic material; vaccination; antibody titer; child; environmental exposure; exposure; health hazard; human; humoral immunity; immunoglobulin blood level; immunotoxicity; particulate matter 2.5; pollutant; priority journal; Review; vaccination"

Perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) ionomer materials remain the technological membrane of choice for PEMFCs because of their robustness, versatility of use, and widespread commercial availability. PFSAs, however, are far from ideal: they are prepared from fluorine-based chemicals that are under increasing environmental scrutiny, they are inherently expensive to prepare and dispose of, their ionic conductivity is limited, and they are highly permeable to gases. Numerous classes of ion-containing polymers have been investigated as potential replacements over the past decades, but PFSA remains the incumbent technology because hydrocarbon-based solid polymer electrolyte membranes are perceived to lack the oxidative stability of their fluorine-containing counterparts. A new era of hydrocarbon PEM research has recently emerged with an emphasis on the hydrocarbon membrane's inherent lower gas permeability and unanticipated stability in fuel cell applications. Of the various classes of polymer derivatives that hold promise, sulfonated polyphenylenes, devoid of heteroatom linkages in the main chain, are leading candidates. The absence of heteroatom linkages in the polymer backbone is not without penalty: their synthesis is challenging and processing restricted due to their rigid-rod character, coupled with the requirement to attach acid bearing groups in high concentration. This review focuses exclusively on the evolution of sulfonated polyphenylenes, from intractable rigid rods to architecturally-controlled, sterically-encumbered sulfo-phenylated polyphenylenes, with an emphasis on synthesis, precise molecular control, structure-property relationships, and ultimately, wide-scale adoption in fuel cells. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

My career began in internal medicine, shifted to pediatrics, and clinical practice changed to research. My research interest was initially in hematology: on plasma proteins, their metabolism, synthesis, and function. This narrowed to a focus on proteins of the human complement system, their role in immunity and their genetics, beginning with polymorphism and deficiency of C3. My group identified genetic polymorphisms and/or inherited deficiencies of C2, C4, C6, and C8. After defining glycine-rich beta glycoprotein as factor B (Bf) in the properdin system, we found that the genes for Bf (CFB), C2, C4A, and C4B were inherited as a single haplotypic unit which we named the “complotype.” Complotypes are located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) between HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 and are designated (in arbitrary order) by their CFB, C2, C4A, and C4B types. Pedigree analysis revealed long stretches (several megabases) of apparently fixed DNA within the MHC that we referred to as “extended haplotypes” (later as “CEHs”). About 10 to 12 common CEHs constitute at least 25 – 30% of MHC haplotypes among European Caucasian populations. These CEHs contain virtually all the most common markers of MHC-associated diseases. In the case of type 1 diabetes, we have proposed a purely genetic and epigenetic model (with a small number of Mendelian recessive disease genes) that explains all the puzzling features of the disease, including its rising incidence. © Copyright © 2021 Alper.","haptoglobin; HLA B antigen; HLA DQB1 antigen; HLA DRB1 antigen; allele; chromosomal mapping; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical practice; complement deficiency; complement system; DNA sequence; epigenetics; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic marker; genetic model; genetic polymorphism; genetic susceptibility; genotype; haplotype; HLA typing; human; incidence; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; major histocompatibility complex; pedigree analysis; Review; single nucleotide polymorphism"

Most often, laboratory trials are conducted to assess the removal efficiency of ARB and ARGs in individual treatment processes (e.g., disinfection). However, the random variations of microbial distribution and chemical compositions in real-world environments cannot be entirely simulated, presumably leading to false-positive results as a consequence. It is therefore useful to provide a summary of recent advancements regarding the antibiotic resistance attenuation during full-scale water/wastewater treatments, which has not been adequately evaluated so far. In this review, the prevalence, proliferation and transmission of ARB and ARGs in urban water cycle, coupled with corresponding detection methods are presented as a short overview.

This concept is a novel approach to chemicals management that determines whether using substances of concern, such as PFAS, is truly essential for a given functionality. To assess the essentiality of a particular use case, three considerations need to be addressed: (1) the function (chemical, end use and service) that the chemical provides in the use case, (2) whether the function is necessary for health and safety and critical for the functioning of society and (3) if the function is necessary, whether there are viable alternatives for the chemical for this particular use. A few illustrative examples of the three-step process are provided for use cases of PFAS. The essential-use concept takes chemicals management away from a substance-by-substance approach to a group approach. For PFAS and other substances of concern, it offers a more rapid pathway toward effective management or phase-out. Parts of the concept of essential use have already been widely applied in global treaties and international regulations and it has also been recently used by product manufacturers and retailers to phase out substances of concern from supply chains.

Our meta‐analysis indicated that PFCs exposure could be associated with CVDs (Test for overall effect: z= 2.2, p = 0.02; Test for heterogeneity: I2 = 91.6%, CI = 0.92–1.58, p &lt; 0.0001) and their risk factors (Test for overall effect: z= 4.03, p &lt; 0.0001; Test for heterogeneity: I2 = 85.8%, CI = 1.00– 1.14, p &lt; 0.0001). In serum lipids, total cholesterol levels are frequently reported associated with the exposure of PFCs. Among PFCs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) exposure increased the risk of CVDs than other types of PFCs. Although the risk of PFOA and PFOS were positively associated with CVDs and their risk factors, more observational studies shall be carried out to identify the long‐term effects of these contaminants in premature CVDs development in patients. © 2021 by the authors.

The geospatial distribution of DNA ad-ducts, some of which are believed to initiate mutation, may be a clue to understanding the landscape of the preferred occurrence of gastric cancer in the human stomach, such that the occurrence is much more frequent in the lesser curvature than in the greater curvature. Methods: Seven DNA adducts, C5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine, 2′-deoxyinosine, C5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxycytidine, N6-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine, 1,N6-etheno-2′-deoxyadenosine, N6-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyadenosine, and C8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine, from different points and zones of the human stomach were semi quanti-tatively measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The differences in the quantity of these DNA adducts from the lesser and greater curvature, the upper, middle and lower third zones, the anterior and posterior wall of the stomach, and the mucosae distant from and near the tumor were compared to determine whether the location preference of cancer in the stomach could be explained by the distribution of these DNA adducts. Comparisons were conducted con-sidering the tumor locations and operation methods. Conclusions: Regarding the DNA adducts in-vestigated, significant differences in quantities and locations in the whole stomach were not noted; thus, these DNA adducts do not explain the preferential occurrence of cancer in particular locations of the human stomach. © 2021 by the authors.

In addition, mutations of critical genes cause monogenic diabetes. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the primary site for proinsulin folding; therefore, ER proteostasis is crucial for both β-cell function and survival under physiological and pathophysiological challenges. Importantly, the ER is also the major intracellular Ca2+ storage organelle, generating Ca2+ signals that contribute to insulin secretion. ER stress is associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. In this Review, we summarize the mutations in monogenic diabetes that play causal roles in promoting ER stress in β-cells. Furthermore, we discuss the possible mechanisms responsible for ER proteostasis imbalance with a focus on T2DM, in which both genetics and environment are considered important in promoting ER stress in β-cells. We also suggest that controlled insulin secretion from β-cells might reduce the progression of a key aspect of the metabolic syndrome, namely nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Among them, hybrid adsorption/biological technology could offer different possibilities that are explored in this work (PAC-MBR, PACT/GAC-CAS, BAC configurations). In this way, different variations in the adsorption process have been considered: the form of the adsorbent, the feed to the system, and the type of biological process, either conventional activated sludge (CAS), membrane bioreactor (MBR) or biofilm systems. For each combination, the removal efficiency of micropollutants, classified according to their use into pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PCPs) and other micropollutants (mainly benzotriazoles) was analysed. From reported data, it was observed a beneficial synergistic effect of dipole moment and octanol–water partition coefficient on the removal efficiency of micropollutants by adsorption/biological hybrid technology. Finally, a preliminary economic evaluation of the powdered activated carbon in a conventional activated sludge reactor (PACT), powdered activated carbon-membrane bioreactor (PAC-MBR) and biological activated carbon (BAC) hybrid systems was carried out by analysing the capital expenditure (CAPEX) of plants for capacities up to 75,000 m3d−1. Likewise, estimations of adsorbent concentration for a hypothetical plant with a capacity of 10,000 m3d−1 is presented.

The active phase in cobalt-based FTS, including the reaction pathways it catalyzes, has been of industrial and academic interest for many years. It provides direct ways to control the output of the process. The delineation between an active and inactive phase is often unclear, as different phases (i.e., cobalt oxide, carbide, and metal) have different catalytic behavior.

In light of these concerns, it is very imperative to critically review the challenges and various approaches aimed at demystifying their roles and improving their performance in FTS for sustainable production of clean fuels. First, the structures and essential properties of iron carbides were evaluated and recent research advances in the synthesis of iron carbides were discussed and compared. Second, the structural elucidations of carbide phases using in situ studies, their performances and thermodynamic stability in FT reaction were discussed.

Due to their chemical stability, PFAS represent a major cause of environmental pollution. PFAS accumulate in animal and human blood and tissues exerting their toxicity. We performed a review of the epidemiological studies exploring the relationship between exposure to PFAS and thromboembolic cardiovascular disease. An increase in cardiovascular disease or death related to PFAS exposure has been reported from cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies with evidence concerning the relation with early vascular lesions and atherosclerosis. Several studies indicate an alteration in lipid and glucose metabolism disorders and increased blood pressure as a possible link with cardiovascular thromboembolic events. We also examined the recent evidence indicating that legacy and new PFAS can be incorporated in platelet cell membranes giving a solid rationale to the observed increase risk of cardiovascular events in the populations exposed to PFAS by directly promoting thrombus formation. Exposure to PFAS has been related to altered plasma membrane fluidity and associated with altered calcium signal and increased platelet response to agonists, both in vitro and ex vivo in subjects exposed to PFAS. All the functional responses are increased in platelets by incorporation of PFAS: adhesion, aggregation, microvesicles release and experimental thrombus formation. These findings offer mechanistic support the hypothesis that platelet-centred mechanisms may be implicated in the increase in cardiovascular events observed in populations chronically exposed to PFAS. © Copyright © 2021 Meneguzzi, Fava, Castelli and Minuz.",

This situation encouraged the poultry sector and industry to explore safe alternatives to AGPs and focus on developing more sustainable feed management strategies to improve the intestinal health and growth performance of poultry. Consequently, phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) have emerged as natural alternatives to AGPs and have great potential in the poultry industry. In recent years, cinnamon (one of the most widely used spices) has attracted attention from researchers as a natural product with numerous health benefits for poultry. The essential oils in cinnamon, in particular, are of interest because of their antioxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and hypocholesterolaemic effects, in addition to their ability to stimulate digestive enzymes in the gut. This review mainly emphasizes the potential impact of cinnamon as a natural feed additive on overall gut health, nutrient digestibility, blood biochemical profile, gene expression, gut microbiota and immune response. © 2021 by the authors.

However, their structural and chemical similarities have proven daunting challenges to incumbent separation technologies, which are energy- and capital-intensive. Approaches capable of discerning and exploiting minute differences in isomeric hydrocarbons, in particular, may provide solutions to this problem. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) integrating the merits of tunable pore size at sub-angstrom scale and pore chemistry in confined spaces have presented promising prospects in adsorptive separation to recognize the minor differences in gas molecules via the judicious design and functionalization. In this Review, we explore the usage of MOFs for the underexplored adsorptive separation of hydrocarbons in the liquid/vapor phase, especially for C6 and C8 isomers. The in-depth insights into the structure-property relationship and the dominant mechanisms, including host-guest interaction modes for the effective adsorption of C6 and C8 hydrocarbons, are systematically discussed.

Many studies show that the pathogenesis of heat stress is mainly related to oxidative stress, hormone secretion disorder, cytokine imbalance, cell apoptosis, cell autophagy, and abnormal cell function. Its mechanism refers to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway, the fluctuation of tight junction protein and heat shock protein expression, and protein epigenetic modification.

In this regard, the present review focuses on the development of electrochemical oxidation (EO) as a sustainable and efficacious technology for the treatment of wastewater containing xenobiotics. The technology of EO works on the process of in-situ generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (OḢ), commonly via metallic cathode catalysts due to the application of electric current, which further oxidizes and is thus effective in eliminating pollutants such as xenobiotics from wastewater. This mini-review will aid in understanding the application of EO for the removal of xenobiotics from wastewater and different metal catalysts employed in EO for the production of hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, the critical factors affecting the performance of EO for xenobiotics removal have also been elucidated for enhancing the understanding of the readers in terms of scaling-up of an EO reactor. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Biochemistry; Catalysts; Electrochemical oxidation; Endocrine disrupters; Hydrogen production; Wastewater treatment; Critical factors; Emerging contaminant; Hydroxyl radicals; Metallic cathodes; Potential threats; Production of hydrogen; Wastewater treatment technologies; Xenobiotic compounds; Chemicals removal (water treatment); catalyst; drug; electrochemical method; hydroxyl radical; oxidation; toxicity; wastewater treatment; xenobiotics"

Based on the updated safety limits, studies in Chinese population have gradually indicated the potential risk of PFAS. This review summarizes the updated international safety limits, and introduces the research progress in health risk assessment of PFAS exposure in Chinese population according to different sources of exposure (diet, milk, drinking water, dust, atmosphere, placental transfer and comprehensive sources). The existing studies mainly focus on the health risk of PFAS exposure in high PFAS-polluted areas and in sensitive infant population in China, while the health risk of PFAS exposure in general population still needs to be further evaluated. It is necessary to carry out relevant work, which can provide reference for relevant government departments to formulate PFAS control standards and safety limits in line with China's national conditions as soon as possible.

The properties that made PFAS into an industrial success also led to their persistence and bioaccumulation. As PFAS were widely used for many decades their presence is evident globally, and their persistence and potential for toxicity create concern for human, animal and environmental health. Following the precautionary principle, a reduction in human exposure is generally recommended. The most significant source of human exposure to PFAS is dietary intake (food and water) with additional exposure via dust. As PFAS concentrations have been more frequently studied in aquatic food sources, there is less understanding of exposure via terrestrial animals. To further define human exposure via animal products, it is necessary to determine PFAS concentrations and persistence in terrestrial livestock and game species. Studies assessing ambient concentrations of PFAS have noted that, aside from point sources of contamination, there is generally low input of PFAS into terrestrial agricultural food chains. However, livestock and game species may be exposed to PFAS via contaminated water, soil, substrate, air or food, and the contribution of these exposures to PFAS concentrations in food products is less well studied. This review focuses on perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAAs) and compiles information from terrestrial livestock and game species as a source of dietary exposure in humans, and discusses toxicokinetics and health effects in animals, while identifying future focus areas. Publications describing the transfer of PFAAs to farmed and hunted animals are scarce, and demonstrate large variability in distribution and elimination. We outline several relatively small, short-term studies in cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry.

To conduct a mass balance of PFAS through these engineered systems, environmental analytical chemistry must be leveraged to quantify PFAS in the various media that cycle through these facilities. Although mass balances have been attempted across various unit treatment processes for a small selection of PFAS in WTPs and WWTPs, system-wide mass balances are a daunting challenge that have not been achieved to date. The continued existence of legacy PFAS and the constantly moving target of newly emerging commercial PFAS and transformation products (TPs), in addition to complications resulting from bias-free collection of uncontaminated samples for PFAS in the parts-per-trillion (ppt) range, complicate a mass balance. Further compounding a mass balance is the diverse universe of PFAS which consists of polar/nonpolar, nonvolatile/semi-volatile/volatile, and neutral/anionic/cationic/zwitterionic chemicals. The physicochemical properties of these chemicals, and the media in which they exist, drive the selection of appropriate analytical procedures to provide accurate and precise quantification of these compounds. The current state of analytical science for PFAS is development of methods specific for subgroups of PFAS families in limited matrices. Here, approaches to integrate analytical workflows across types of PFAS and media are proposed. In this evaluation, multi-platform targeted, suspect/non-targeted, and surrogate screening methods combining promulgated standardized methods and emerging procedures are presented. Synthesis of a comprehensive analytical workflow that aspires to achieve a mass balance of PFAS across the gaseous, solid, and aqueous matrices encountered in WTPs and WWTPs is proposed.

This stage focuses on research on the distribution coefficient of PAHs between different environmental phases and laid the foundation for the adsorption-desorption of PAHs in subsequent studies of the bioac-bioav of PAHs. The research progress on PAH bioac-bioav from 2000 to the present was evaluated using the Citespace software based on country- and discipline-wise publication volumes and research hotspots. The development stages of PAH bioac-bioav after 2000 were divided into four time segments. The first three segments (2000–2005, 2006–2010, and 2011–2015) focused on the degradation of PAHs and their in vivo (bioavailability)-in vitro (bioaccessibility) evaluation method and risk assessment. Meanwhile, the current (2016–present) research focuses on the establishment of analytical methods for assessing PAH derivatives at environmental concentrations and the optimization of various in vitro digestion methods, including chemical optimization (sorptive sink) and biological optimization (Caco-2 cell). The contents are aimed at supplying researchers with a deeper understanding of the development of PAH bioac-bioav. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biochemistry; Chemical analysis; Economics; Mineral oils; Risk assessment; Statistics; Adsorption desorption; Bioavailability/bioaccessibility; Chemical optimizations; Distribution coefficient; Environmental concentration; In-vitro digestions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Risk assessment models; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; organic carbon; organochlorine pesticide; organophosphate pesticide; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; unclassified drug; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; adsorption; bioavailability; contaminated land; desorption; health risk; literature review; optimization; PAH; pollution monitoring; research work; risk assessment; adsorption; air pollution; bioaccumulation; bioavailability; biodegradation; bioremediation; concentration (parameter); desorption; dust; ecotoxicology; health hazard; hydrophobicity; molecular stability; persistent organic pollutant; process optimization; Review; risk assessment; sediment; soil pollution; solubilization; systematic review; water contamination; bioavailability; Caco-2 cell line; environmental exposure; human; soil pollutant; Biological Availability; Caco-2 Cells; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Soil Pollutants"

We critically reviewed current evidence from human epidemiological, in vitro, and animal studies, including mammalian and aquatic model organisms. Epidemiological studies identified the associations between perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure and epigenetic changes in both adult populations and birth cohorts. For in vitro studies, various cell types including neuroblasts, preadipocytes, and hepatocytes have been employed to understand epigenetic effects of PFAS. In studies with animal models, effects of early life exposure to PFAS have been examined using rodent models, and aquatic models (e.g., zebrafish) have been more frequently used in recent years. Several studies highlighted oxidative stress as a key mediator between epigenetic modification and health effects. Collectively, previous research clearly suggest involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in PFAS induced toxicity, though these efforts have primarily focused on specific PFASs (i.e. mainly PFOS and PFOA) or endpoints (i.e. cancer). Additional studies are necessary to define specific linkages among epigenetic mechanisms and related biomarkers or phenotypical changes. In addition, future research is also needed for understudied PFAS and complex mixtures.

The annual publication output has trended upwards since 2002. Authors based in China accounted for 29.4% of the total publications, followed by USA (17.4%); but overall publications from Switzerland and Spain were more influential. Major research themes identified included OUVF concentrations in aquatic environments, and hormonal effects. Emerging themes included improving the sensitivity of analytical detection methods for both OUVFs and their metabolites, consequences of OUVF transport to the marine environment, and concerns over prenatal exposure. Based on keyword analysis, benzophenone-3, 4-methylbenzylidene-camphor, 3-benzylidene camphor, and ethylhexyl-methoxycinnamate are the most studied OUVFs, and effects on estrogenic activity, gene expression, reproduction, and more recently, oxidative stress, have received most attention from a toxicological perspective.

Despite the successful applications of FTS as the core technology of coal-to-liquid and gas-to-liquid processes in industry, the product selectivity control of syngas conversion still remains a great challenge, particularly for value-added chemicals such as light olefins. Recent studies show that the catalyst design concept of OXZEO (oxide-zeolite-based composite) enables direct syngas conversion to mixed light olefins with a selectivity reaching 80% and to ethylene with a selectivity of 83% among hydrocarbons. They both well-surpass the limits predicated by the Anderson-Schultz-Flory model via the conventional FTS route (58% and 30%, respectively). Furthermore, this catalyst concept allows one-step synthesis of gasoline-range isoparaffins and aromatic compounds, which is otherwise not possible in conventional FTS. A rapidly growing number of studies demonstrate the versatility of this concept and may form a technology platform for utilization of carbon resources including coal, natural gas, and biomass via syngas to a variety of basic chemicals and fuels. However, the selectivity control mechanism is far from being understood. Therefore, we focus mainly on the catalytic roles of the bifunctionalities of OXZEO while reviewing the development of bifunctional catalysts for selective syngas conversion by taking syngas-to-light olefins as an example. With this, we intend to provide insights into the selectivity control mechanism of the OXZEO concept in order to understand the challenges and prospects for future development of much more active and more selective catalysts. ©","Coal deposits; Coal industry; Ethylene; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Natural gas deposits; Natural gasoline plants; Petroleum prospecting; Synthesis gas; Zeolites; Bi-functional catalysts; Composite catalysts; Gas-to-liquid process; Product selectivities; Selective catalysts; Selectivity control; Technology platforms; Value-added chemicals; Catalyst selectivity"

Aggregates of the involved proteins, independently from their primary sequence, induced neuron membrane permeabilization able to trigger an abnormal Ca2+ influx leading to synaptotoxicity, resulting in reduced expression of synaptic proteins and impaired synaptic transmission. Emerging evidence is now focusing on low‐molecular‐weight pre-fibrillar oligomers (PFOs), which mimic bacterial pore‐forming toxins that form well‐ordered oligo-meric membrane‐spanning pores. At the same time, the neuron membrane composition and its chemical microenvironment seem to play a pivotal role. In fact, the brain of AD patients contains increased fractions of anionic lipids able to favor cationic influx. However, up to now the existence of a specific “common structure” of the toxic aggregate, and a “common mechanism” by which it induces neuronal damage, synaptotoxicity and impaired synaptic transmission, is still an open hy-pothesis.

A CMR combines a chemical or biochemical reaction with a membrane separation process in a single unit by improving the performance of the process in terms of conversion and selectivity. The core of the CMR is the membrane which can be polymeric or inorganic depending on the operating conditions of the catalytic process. Besides, the membrane can be inert or catalytically active. The number of studies devoted to applying CMR with higher membrane area per unit volume in multi-phase reactions remains very limited for both catalytic polymeric and inorganic membranes. The various bio-based catalytic membrane system is also used in a different commercial application.

In 2015, ASTM International published ASTM D7979, for the analysis of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances in non-potable water samples. This method extracts the substances by co-solvation with methanol and measures targeted compounds using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. ASTM D7979 is a performance-based method that analyzes 31 compounds plus 14 isotopically labeled surrogates. The minimum reporting limit is approximately 10 ng/L with an analytical range of 10–200 ng/L for most compounds. Expected recovery of surrogates and spiked matrices is 70–130%. Samples containing high suspended solids can be analyzed with minimal interferences and potential loss of analyte. The method is consistent with ASTM and EPA's sustainable development goals by using reduced volumes of sample, solvent, and minimizing hazardous solvents and sample preparation materials while maintaining data quality and detection limits that are suitable for the intended use. This paper covers the rationale, outlines some of the challenges associated with analysis of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances, and describes the steps taken by the ASTM Committee D19 task group to develop, optimize, and validate this method. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Mass spectrometry; Methanol; Potable water; Solvation; ASTM international; Hazardous solvents; Isotopically labeled; Performance based method; Polyfluorinated alkyl substances; Sample preparation; Suspended solids; Tandem mass spectrometry; Liquid chromatography; 4:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid; 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid; 8:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid; chemical compound; ground water; methanol; n ethylperfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid; n methylperfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid; per and polyfluorinated alkyl substance; perfluorobutane sulfonic acid; perfluorobutanoic acid; perfluoroctane sulfonamide; perfluorodecane sulfonic acid; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorododecanoic acid; perfluoroheptane sulfonic acid; perfluoroheptanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorononane sulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluoropentane sulfonic acid; perfluoropentanoic acid; perfluorotetradecanoic acid; perfluorotridecanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; river water; unclassified drug; calibration; controlled study; filtration; intermethod comparison; landfill leachate; liquid chromatography; liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry; Review; solid phase extraction; solvation; triple quadrupole mass spectrometry; wastewater; water sampling"

Using these sensitive methods, some epidemiology studies report associations between biomarkers and health outcomes at biomarker levels much below those associated with effects in animal studies. While some of these low exposure associations may arise from increased sensitivity of humans compared with animals or from species-specific responses, toxicology studies with drugs, commodity chemicals and consumer products have not generally indicated significantly greater sensitivity of humans compared with test animals for most health outcomes. In some cases, these associations may be indicative of pharmacokinetic (PK) bias, i.e., a situation where a confounding factor or the health outcome itself alters pharmacokinetic processes affecting biomarker levels. Quantitative assessment of PK bias combines PK modeling and statistical methods describing outcomes across large numbers of individuals in simulated populations. Here, we first provide background on the types of PK models that can be used for assessing biomarker levels in human population and then outline a process for considering PK bias in studies intended to assess associations between biomarkers and health outcomes at low levels of exposure. After providing this background, we work through published examples where these PK methods have been applied with several chemicals/chemical classes - polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polybrominated biphenyl ethers (PBDE) and phthalates - to assess the possibility of PK bias. Studies of the health effects of low levels of exposure will be improved by developing some confidence that PK bias did not play significant roles in the observed associations. © 2021 The Author(s)","biological marker; phthalic acid; plasticizer; polybrominated biphenyl; polychlorinated biphenyl; biological marker; diphenyl ether derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; biomarker; drug; numerical model; PCB; phthalate; quantitative analysis; toxicology; biological monitoring; birth weight; controlled study; endometriosis; environmental exposure; human; menarche; menopause; newborn period; nonhuman; pharmacokinetic parameters; prenatal exposure; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Review; statistical analysis; toxicity; animal; epidemiology; pollutant; Animals; Biomarkers; Environmental Pollutants; Epidemiologic Studies; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Polychlorinated Biphenyls"

In Western countries, health advisories regarding PFAS exposure have been released to warn the public of its potential adverse effects. However, awareness regarding PFAS exposure in Asia is still at its infancy as reflected by the minimal safeguards imposed to protect the population from exposure. Here, we reviewed studies on PFAS contamination in Asia with a focus on freshwater resources to determine whether PFAS is also a concern in this part of the globe. Peer reviewed articles which included information on PFAS levels from 2000 to 2020 were compiled. The highest PFAS contamination was detected in surface water relative to ground, tap, and drinking water. PFAS levels in water resources in several countries in Asia, such as China, Japan, and South Korea, were above the recommended level, similar to that in the United States. PFAS in South and Southeast Asia were just below the recommended level, but the rise of PFAS in China in the recent decade, alongside its remarkable economic and industrial growth, suggests that increased PFAS contamination in South and Southeast Asia may soon follow, as these countries compete with the global economy. Hence, there is a need for these countries to also implement measures that will reduce the exposure of their population to PFAS. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","drinking water; fresh water; ground water; perfluoro compound; surface water; tap water; drinking water; fluorocarbon; fresh water; bioaccumulation; chemical pollutant; drinking water; economic growth; global economy; literature review; persistence; surface water; water resource; Asia; China; Japan; priority journal; Review; South Asia; South Korea; Southeast Asia; United States; water availability; water contamination; water supply; Asia; human; water pollutant; China; Japan; South Korea; United States; Asia; China; Drinking Water; Fluorocarbons; Fresh Water; Humans; Japan; Republic of Korea; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Environmental toxicants, especially those that disrupt normal placental and endothelial function, are emerging as potential risk factors for HDP. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large group of ubiquitous chemicals found in consumer products, the environment, and increasingly in drinking water. PFAS have been associated with a multitude of adverse health effects, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, and more recently, HDP. In this review, we present epidemiological and mechanistic evidence for the link between PFAS and HDP and recommend next steps for research and prevention efforts. To date, epidemiological studies have assessed associations between only ten of the thousands of PFAS and HDP. Positive associations between six PFAS (PFOA, perfluorooctanoic acid; PFOS, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid; PFHxS, perfluorohexane sulfonic acid; PFHpA, perfluoroheptanoic acid; PFBS, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid; and PFNA, perfluoronanoic acid) and risk for HDP have been reported in some, but not all, studies. PFAS disrupt placental and immune function, cause oxidative stress, and disrupt lipid metabolism. These physiological disruptions may be mechanisms through which PFAS can lead to HDP. Overall, limited epidemiological evidence and plausible mechanisms support PFAS as risk factors for HDP. More research is needed in diverse, well-powered cohorts that assess exposures to as many PFAS as possible. Such research should consider not only individual PFAS but also the totality of exposures to PFAS and other environmental chemicals. Pregnant women may be a group that is vulnerable to PFAS exposure, and as such HDP risk should be considered by policymakers setting PFAS exposure limits. In the interim, medical and public health professionals in regions with PFAS contamination could provide short-term solutions in the form of patient-level prevention, increased monitoring, and early intervention for HDP. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","endocrine disruptor; environmental chemical; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorobutanesulfonic acid; perfluoroheptanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluoronanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; drinking water; epidemiology; health risk; hypertension; metabolism; pollution exposure; pregnancy; risk factor; womens health; cardiovascular disease; contamination; ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; environmental policy; female; human; lipid metabolism; maternal hypertension; medical care; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; physiological stress; preeclampsia; prenatal exposure; priority journal; public health; Review; risk factor; environmental exposure; placenta; pollutant; pregnancy; toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Placenta; Pregnancy; Risk Factors"

PFAS have become a global concern due to their toxicity and bio-accumulative properties. PFAS species have been ubiquitously detected in natural waters, wastewaters, sludge, and aquatic and terrestrial species which are anionic, zwitterionic and neutral. The ion exchange (IX) process for PFAS removal is an efficient technology for the remediation of PFAS-laden surface, ground and effluent wastewaters. This approach is more effective towards eliminating emerging short-chain PFAS which are not removed by carbon-based adsorption processes. This article presents a state-of-the-art review of PFAS removal from water via IX process. The evaluation and comparison of various IX resins in terms of kinetics and isotherms is presented. Literature data indicates that IX isotherm uptake capacity for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) can range up to 5 mmol/g on commercially available IX resins such as IRA 958 and IRA 67. The mechanism involved in the PFAS uptake process, such as diffusion, electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic effects are discussed.

Owing to anthropogenic sources and booming industrial practices, the most challenging issue is increased water pollution and environmental insecurity. For instance, several types of synthetic dyes are toxic up to a certain extent, as emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) pose adverse environmental and potential health consequences. A gradual increase in the contamination sources and unpredictable environmental changes in terms of anthropogenic pollution severely affect both water availability and distribution. Therefore, the treatment of dyes containing wastewater matrices for water resource generation is one of the most important tasks, which must be addressed effectively. With structural tunability, MOFs have been appearing as a robust tool for remediating toxic pollutants from wastewater matrices. Moreover, the promising functionality, structural tunability, robust catalytic attributes, compatibility, large surface area, stability in water, and ease in surface functionalization make MOFs one of the considerable materials of interest. This review work spotlights the present-day progress related to MOFs and their catalytic and adsorptive chemistry for a sustainable environment. Following a brief introduction, the characteristic rendering MOFs, as adsorbents, are given with prominent examples. Next, several synthesis routes as a roadmap to engineer MOFs are discussed.

Little is known about the fate of PFAS through incineration, in particular, for the systems employed in water resource recovery facilities (WRRF). This review covers available research on the fate of PFAS through incineration systems with a focus on sewage sludge incinerators. This research indicates that at least some PFAS destruction will occur with incineration approaches used at WRRFs. Furthermore, PFAS in flue gas, ash, or water streams used for incinerator pollution control may be undetectable. Future research involving full-scale fate studies will provide insight on the efficacy of PFAS destruction through incineration and whether other compounds of concern are generated. Practitioner points: Thermal processing is the only commercial approach available to destroy PFAS. Thermal degradation conditions required for destruction of PFAS during incineration processes are discussed.

Concurrently, many regulatory agencies are publishing criteria used in practice to define the ""nature and extent""of PFAS-impacted environmental media. Specific to the soil-to-groundwater transport pathway protective of the groundwater ingestion end point, these soil criteria (or screening values) are to date exclusively based on the traditional approach used for hydrophobic organics with a number of simplifying assumptions. Research has clearly contradicted these assumptions, yet alternative methodologies have yet to emerge from the literature. This Perspective provides a rationale for why alternative approaches are critically necessary and proposes the application of lysimetry as a practical solution to accurately assess PFAS transport within unsaturated vadose zone soils. Ultimately, there is an urgent need to justify soil remediation on the basis of groundwater protection and to prioritize remedial efforts in order to optimize limited fiscal resources. © Not subject to U.S. Copyright.

Because of the associated practices, the flows of several environmental pollutants into the organic products threaten food safety and human health. The contaminants that occur at higher concentrations in organic produce include persistent organic pollutants (61.3–436.9 ng g−1 lamb meat, and 0.28 pg g−1-2.75 ng g−1 bovine meat), heavy metals (0.5–33.0 mg kg−1 lettuce), organochlorine pesticides (11–199 μg g−1 carrots), cyclodienes, hexachlorocyclohexanes, hexabromocyclododecane (2–3 times higher than in conventionally produced porcine meat), hexachlorobenzene (1.38–14.49 ng g−1 fat in milk), and non-brominated flame retardants (1.3–3.2 times higher than in conventional produce of greenhouse-grown tomato and cucumber). Moreover, some pollutants like per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances with a longer half-life (1.50–9.10 yrs) are reported to occur in several organic products. In fact, several legacy persistent organic pollutants are known for their significant trophic magnification in an urban terrestrial ecosystem. In addition, many plant functionalities are adversely affected in organic farming. Therefore, the long-term usage of organic products containing such pollutants poses a significant threat to human health. The major limitation in organic livestock production is the severe shortage of organic feed. Several variable standards and technical regulations set by the government and private agencies are the major obstacles in the global marketing of organic products. The present review critically addresses the impact of organic farming on hidden risks due to the use of composts as the amendment resources that enhance the phytoaccumulation and trophic transfer of pollutants, the functional diversity of the ecosystems, and poor harmonization among the policies and regulations in different countries for organic farming. The future directions of research have been suggested to mitigate unintended flows of pollutants into the organic products. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Composting; Developing countries; Ecosystems; Flame retardants; Food safety; Health; Health risks; Heavy metals; Mammals; Meats; Brominated flame retardants; Environmental pollutants; Hexabromocyclododecanes; Organochlorine pesticides; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Terrestrial ecosystems; Trophic magnifications; Organic pollutants; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; chlortetracycline; ciprofloxacin; flame retardant; heavy metal; hexabromocyclododecane; hexachlorobenzene; hexachlorocyclohexane; organochlorine pesticide; oxytetracycline; paracetamol; surface water; tap water; tetracycline; theophylline; flame retardant; agricultural policy; bioaccumulation; biodiversity; concentration (composition); flame retardant; food safety; future prospect; health risk; organic farming; persistent organic pollutant; pollutant transport; terrestrial ecosystem; trophic structure; urban area; cattle manure; environmental policy; environmental sustainability; food safety; food shortage; greenhouse; human; lamb meat; livestock; nonhuman; organic farming; persistent organic pollutant; plant growth; priority journal; Review; sewage; soil property; swine manure; animal; bovine; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; food safety; organic farming; pig; Bovinae; Cucumis sativus; Daucus carota; Lactuca; Lycopersicon esculentum; Animals; Cattle; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Flame Retardants; Food Safety; Humans; Organic Agriculture; Swine"

Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are emerging pollutants which possess adverse ecological risk. In this review, we have compiled the data on the levels of PFAAs in environmental samples, mainly in estuarine and coastal zones. A worldwide map was generated to show the distribution of PFAAs. The experimental results have also been considered, which, together with those of environmental samples, has allowed us to infer about the factors that intervene in the behavior of PFAAs. The presence of PFAAs is determined primarily by the source of pollution. Salinity is as well shown as a significant condition, dependent too on the sampling environment. The analysis of PFAAs from environmental samples constitutes a fundamental tool for the surveillance of these pollutants, but the lack of homogeneity of protocols for sampling, as well as for the results presentation, limits the comparative capacity. Laboratory studies are also an essential tool in the analysis of particular aspects related to PFAAs, but many times the conditions tested are not environmentally significant. In this way, it would not be prudent to establish “paradigms” about the behavior of the PFAAs in certain areas or organisms, instead to suggest the points that can be considered fundamental for each issue addressed. The main variables that appear to intervene in estuarine and coastal regions are mainly the proximity to the source of pollution, salinity, pH, precipitation (rain) as well as types of PFAAs. All these can synergistically lead to different impacts on the ecosystem. Therefore, the particular risks of PFAAs in estuarine and coastal regions is a set of multiple variables, dependent on each sampling condition and according to the previously named parameters. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Estuaries; Pollution; Rain; Ecological values; Emerging pollutants; Environmental factors; Environmental sample; Laboratory studies; Perfluoroalkyl acids; Results presentation; Sampling conditions; Coastal zones; aquatic organism; chemical pollutant; coastal zone; environmental factor; estuarine pollution; estuarine sediment; organohalogen; pollutant source; salinity; spatial distribution; toxicity; aquatic species; coastal waters; environmental factor; estuary; human; nonhuman; pollutant; precipitation; review; salinity; seashore; sediment"

Zinc porphyrin dye sensitizer YD2-o-C8 has become a research hotspot due to its high molar absorption coefficient and environmental friendliness. However, YD2-o-C8 and its derivatives still have some shortcomings in the application: (1) the carboxyl anchoring group is easy to desorb, which makes the dye unstable; (2) the low absorption intensity of dye sensitizer in the near-infrared region reduces the photoelectric conversion performance, which limits its large-scale production and application; (3) the easily self-polymerized dye sensitizer can shorten the service life and reduce the photoelectric conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells. In recent years, based on zinc porphyrin dye sensitizer YD2-o-C8, many derivative porphyrin dye sensitizers with D-π-A structure have been synthesized by changing the structure of electron donor, electron acceptor and conjugated π-bridge. Dye sensitizers such as WW-6 and NCH3-YD2 appeared by changing the electron donor group. Dye sensitizers such as YD2-II-CA and PorCND1A1 appeared by changing the conjugate π-bridge. Dye sensitizers such as YD2-o-C8T and MH1 are produced by changing the electron-acceptor and anchoring group. These dye sensitizers expand the absorption range of B band and Q band, improve the absorption intensity of near-infrared region, and then improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells. Even some dye sensitizers surpass YD2-o-C8 in stability and service life, which makes the development of dye sensitizer family take on a new look. In this paper, the experimental and theoretical progress of D-π-A zinc porphyrin dye sensitizer YD2-o-C8 and its derivatives are reviewed. The improvement of YD2-o-C8 in electron donor group, conjugated π-bridge and electron-acceptor and anchoring group and its influence on the photoelectric conversion performance are emphasized.

Adverse pregnancy outcomes are multifactorial in nature and increasing evidence suggests that the pathophysiology behind preterm birth and preeclampsia may be similar—specifically, both of these disorders may involve abnormalities in placental vasculature. A growing body of literature supports that exposure to environmental contaminants in the air, water, soil, and consumer and household products serves as a key factor influencing the development of adverse pregnancy outcomes. In pregnant women, toxic metals have been detected in urine, peripheral blood, nail clippings, and amniotic fluid. The placenta serves as a “gatekeeper” between maternal and fetal exposures, because it can reduce or enhance fetal exposure to various toxicants. Proposed mechanisms underlying toxicant-mediated damage include disrupted placental vasculogenesis, an up-regulated proinflammatory state, oxidative stressors contributing to prostaglandin production and consequent cervical ripening, uterine contractions, and ruptured membranes and epigenetic changes that contribute to disrupted regulation of endocrine and immune system signaling. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of studies examining the relationships between environmental contaminants in the US setting, specifically inorganic (eg, cadmium, arsenic, lead, and mercury) and organic (eg, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) toxicants, and the development of preeclampsia and preterm birth among women in the United States. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","arsenic; cadmium; fluorinated hydrocarbon; lead; mercury; metal; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; prostaglandin; unclassified drug; mercury; air pollutant; environmental exposure; heavy metal blood level; human; inflammation; nonhuman; organic pollution; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; preeclampsia; pregnancy outcome; premature fetus membrane rupture; premature labor; prostaglandin synthesis; Review; risk factor; soil pollutant; United States; uterine cervix ripening; uterus contraction; water pollutant; epidemiology; female; newborn; placenta; preeclampsia; pregnancy; prematurity; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Mercury; Placenta; Pre-Eclampsia; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Premature Birth; United States"

This class of compounds has found its way into diverse arrays of water bodies in the environment due to their incomplete decomposition, and also the indiscriminate disposal of pharmaceutical waste from industries, farms, and medical centers. This is often through soluble reactive effluent, water run-offs due to rainfall on agricultural facilities and untreated sewages. Their concentration in the environment usually exceeds the permitted levels, which in turn leads to the possibilities of bio-magnifications and bioaccumulation in the food chain. Consequently, they constitute safety hazards and it is important to remove this class of compounds. Another concern is the development of resistance by the micro-organisms, which could render these drugs ineffective and useless if serious control is not put in place to regulate their usage and presence in the environment. Although different conventional methods are currently used in water treatment plants, the presence of pharmaceuticals, such as antibiotics, has been confirmed in different recycled water meant for consumption. Recently, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have emerged as a useful technique for the mineralization of these antibiotics in water via the use of heterogeneous photocatalysis. In this review, a background study on the origin and fate of pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics, and the usefulness of photocatalysis (a prominent method of advanced oxidation process (AOPs)) in the mineralization of this class of pharmaceuticals into less harmful compounds is assessed. The degradation pathway of different classes of antibiotics is also discussed using specific examples of compounds in each of the classes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agricultural robots; Biochemistry; Effluents; Mineralogy; Photocatalysis; Sewage; Wastewater disposal; Water treatment; Advanced oxidation process; Conventional methods; Degradation pathways; Emerging pollutants; Harmful compounds; Heterogeneous photocatalysis; Pharmaceutical wastes; Untreated sewage; Antibiotics; antibiotic agent; anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; antihypertensive agent; antiinflammatory agent; antilipemic agent; anxiolytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; sex hormone; antibiotics; catalysis; drug; heterogeneity; mineralization; oxidation; photolysis; wastewater treatment; agricultural waste; aquatic environment; bioaccumulation; drug decomposition; drug resistance; effluent; food chain; hospital waste; industrial waste; mineralization; photocatalysis; pollutant; Review; runoff; waste disposal; waste water recycling; waste water treatment plant; wastewater"

Approximately 90% of the compiled published papers originated from Asia, Europe, and the North American regions. The incomplete removal of PPCPs in different water and wastewater treatment processes was widely reported, thus resulting in the occurrence of PPCP compounds in various environmental compartments. Caffeine, carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, triclosan, and triclocarban were among the most commonly reported compounds detected in water and solid matrices. Trace concentrations of PPCPs were also detected on plants and animal tissues, indicating the bioaccumulative properties of some PPCP compounds. A significant lack of studies regarding the presence of PPCPs in animal and plant samples was identified in the review.

Diatom teratological forms are one of the best individual-level biomarkers since they provide a rapid response to several environmental stressors, including new emerging pollutants. The mechanisms involved in teratological valve likely involve both cytoskeleton and silicon metabolic pathway impairments. However, teratologies do not seem to weaken the reproduction capacity and viability of the affected individuals. We recognized eight types of teratologies as involving different parts of the valve, depending on genus.

The use of sartans, introduced in the mid-90s of the last century, has quickly spread mainly due to the alleged reduction in the incidence of certain adverse effects of varying severity (cough, angioedema) associated with the intake of ACE inhibitors. Their very strong commercial success together with their low metabolic degradation and high environmental persistence has consecrated them as emerging pollutants in just 20 years. This review presents a complete picture of sartans in relation to their chemical structure, chemical-physical properties and by-products in aqueous solutions as well as under oxidative and photodegradative conditions, their environmental presence and knowledge known to date and their fate in wastewater treatment plants. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","abitesartan; azilsartan; candesartan; drinking water; elisartan; embusartan; fimasartan; forasartan; irbesartan; losartan; milfasartan; olmesartan; ripisartan; saprisartan; sartan derivative; tasosartan; telmisartan; zolasartan; aquatic environment; aqueous solution; chemical structure; chlorination; photodegradation; physical stress; pollutant; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; waste component removal; waste water treatment plant"

Fluorinated greenhouse gases, or F-gases, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) have been termed “super pollutants” and “super greenhouse gases” given their severe and powerful impact on the climate. They are the most potent greenhouse gases known to modern science, with global warming potentials far greater than carbon dioxide, some up to almost 24,000 times more so. Troublingly, they are also the fastest growing class of greenhouse gas emissions around the world, especially in developing countries. Research suggest that almost 40% of their emissions by 2050 will fall outside the scope of international agreements such as the Paris Accord, Montreal Protocol and Kigali Amendment. Without comprehensive and sustained interventions, uncontrolled growth in F-gas emissions could offset all of the gains made by the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, or the cornerstone of existing international climate governance, the Nationally Determined Contributions of the 2015 Paris Accord. This review asks: What options are available to mitigate the environmental impacts of F-gases and thus make their manufacturing or disposal far more sustainable? What technical solutions and innovations exist to make their industrial usage low to zero carbon? What benefits will accrue from F-gas mitigation, and what barriers will need addressed? It undertakes a comprehensive and critical review of more than 140,000 sources of evidence, and a short list of 855 studies on the topic. It utilizes a sociotechnical lens that examines the manufacturing and use of F-gases across multiple sectors (including refrigeration, electronics manufacturing, non-ferrous metals processing, and applications in consumer goods) and components of its lifecycle (including not only manufacturing, but also use, disposal and destruction). We find that there are several policies and regulations that can be employed to address this already serious and growing climate change challenge. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Fluorocarbons; Gas emissions; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Manufacture; Pollution; Sulfur hexafluoride; Anthropogenic emissions; Climate mitigations; Decarbonisation; Fluorinated greenhouse gas; Fugitive emissions; Global warming potential; Greenhouses gas; High-global warming potential emission; Hydrofluorocarbon-23; Hydrofluorocarbons; Industrial decarbonization; Perfluorocarbons; Short lived climate pollutant; Synthetic greenhouse gas; Trace emission; Greenhouse gases"

The past decades have witnessed a boom in organofluorine chemistry and heterocyclic chemistry mainly owing to the importance of fluorine-containing heterocycles. As a result, the exploitation of readily available fluorinated building blocks to attach Rf groups to various heterocycles has become an important topic in synthetic chemistry. On the other hand, perfluoroalkyl halide, as a low-toxic and environmentally friendly perfluoroalkyl building block, has been extensively utilized as a unique reagent in the heterocycle construction. Considering the great influence and synthetic potential of these novel avenues, we summarize the recent advances for the synthesis of fluoroalkylated heterocycles by using perfluoroalkyl halides as key fluorine-containing building blocks. One or three C-X bonds of perfluoroalkyl halides are cleaved/functiona- lized during the perfluoroalkylation and cyclization process, and a series of perfluoroalkylated heterocycles such as quinoxalines, phenanthridines, hydrazones, thiazoles, pyrimidines, aza-tricycles, isoxazoles,etc. were synthesized in moderate to good yields. With a specific emphasis on their proposed mechanism, we hope this review will be useful for medicinal and synthetic organic chemists who are interested in radical-mediated perfluoroalkylation. © 2021 Chinese Chemical Society & SIOC, CAS.",

We performed a systematic literature review of the relevant literature of PubMed, Cochrane Library databases, Web of Science and Embase from the establishment to April 2020. Studies included the effects of PFOA on the reproductive system of male rodents. The meta-analysis was performed on the basis of the following points: level of testosterone and estradiol in serum, development of reproductive organs, pathological changes of reproduction organs and parameters of semen. A series of 16 studies was enrolled in this study. The standard mean difference (SMD) for PFOA-related reproductive toxicity was summarised as −0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71, −0.07). The lower serum testosterone levels, decreased absolute testicular and epididymal weights, higher serum estradiol levels, elevated relative testicular and seminal vesicle weights and increased incidence of Leydig cell adenoma and percentage of abnormal sperm were observed in the exposed group compared with the control group. However, no statistical difference was found in the day of preputial separation of pups and percentage of motile sperm. In conclusion, PFOA exposure heightens the reproductive system damage in male rodents. However, many studies included in the review did not identify mechanisms by which PFOA induces changes to the male reproductive system, which is an area for additional study. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cell proliferation; Mammals; Confidence interval; Pathological changes; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Reproductive organs; Reproductive systems; Reproductive toxicities; Statistical differences; Systematic literature review; Toxicity; estradiol; perfluorooctanoic acid; testosterone; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; bioaccumulation; cell; ecophysiology; organic pollutant; pathology; pollution effect; pollution exposure; rodent; testosterone; drug exposure; estradiol blood level; incidence; male genital system; nonhuman; reproductive toxicity; seminal plasma; seminal vesicle; testosterone blood level; animal; male; meta analysis; reproduction; rodent; Rodentia; Animals; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Male; Reproduction; Rodentia"

Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) can be an important tool to derive recommendations for cultivation or handling of crops prior consumption. This review compiles >4500 soil-to-plant BAFs for 45 PFASs from 24 studies involving 27 genera of agricultural crops. Grasses (Poaceae) provided most BAFs with the highest number of values for perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid. Influencing factors on PFAS transfer like compound-specific properties (hydrophobicity, chain length, functional group, etc.), plant species, compartments, and other boundary conditions are critically discussed. Throughout the literature, BAFs were higher for vegetative plant compartments than for reproductive and storage organs. Decreasing BAFs per additional perfluorinated carbon were clearly apparent for aboveground parts (up to 1.16 in grains) but not always for roots (partly down to zero). Combining all BAFs per single perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid (C4-C14) and sulfonic acid (C4-C10), median log BAFs decreased by −0.25(±0.029) and −0.24(±0.013) per fluorinated carbon, respectively. For the first time, the plant uptake of ultra-short-chain (≤ C3) perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) was reviewed and showed a ubiquitous occurrence of trifluoroacetic acid in plants independent from the presence of other PFAAs. Based on identified knowledge gaps, it is suggested to focus on the uptake of precursors to PFAAs, PFAAs ≤C3, and additional emerging PFASs such as GenX or fluorinated ethers in future research. Studies regarding the uptake of PFASs by sugar cane, which accounts for about one fifth of the global crop production, are completely lacking and are also recommended. Furthermore, aqueous soil leachates should be tested as an alternative to the solvent extraction of soils as a base for BAF calculations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural robots; Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Carbon; Crops; Soil pollution; Soils; Solvent extraction; Sugar cane; Sugar industry; Agricultural plants; Bioaccumulation factor; Perfluoroalkyl acids; Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Specific properties; Cultivation; alkyl group; carboxylic acid; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoropropionic acid; trifluoroacetic acid; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; aqueous solution; bioaccumulation; concentration (composition); crop plant; soil pollution; source apportionment; surfactant; agricultural species; bioaccumulation; cell membrane; chemical analysis; concentration (parameter); hydrophobicity; leaching; limit of quantitation; nonhuman; plant; plant cell; plant root; pollution transport; Review; shoot; soil pollution; species identification; agriculture; bioaccumulation; crop; soil; water pollutant; Poaceae; Saccharum; Agriculture; Bioaccumulation; Crops, Agricultural; Fluorocarbons; Soil; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The role of the antibiotic properties and the process operating conditions were also analyzed. The pieces of evidence in the literature associate several molecular properties to the antibiotic removal pathway, like hydrophobicity, chemical structure, and electrostatic interactions. Nonetheless, the influence of operating conditions is still unclear, and solid retention time stands out as a key factor. Additionally, the efficiencies and pathways of antibiotic removals on conventional (activated sludge, membrane bioreactor, anaerobic digestion, and nitrogen removal) and emerging bioprocesses (bioelectrochemical systems, fungi, and enzymes) were assessed, and our concern about potential research gaps was raised. The combination of different bioprocess can efficiently mitigate the impacts generated by these pollutants.

Notwithstanding their wide range of applications in consumer products and industrial processes, PFASs have been detected in the environment as well as in human body. Due to their potential adverse human health effects, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set the combined concentration of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water at 70 ng/L or 70 ppt (parts per trillion) as a lifetime health advisory level. Current standard detection methods for PFASs heavily rely on chromatographic techniques coupled with mass spectrometry. Although these methods provide accurate, specific, and sensitive measurements, their applications are greatly limited in advanced analytical laboratories because it necessitates expensive instrumentations, professional operators, complicated sample pretreatment, and considerable analysis time. Therefore, other detection methods beyond chromatographic based techniques, such as optical and electrochemical techniques, have also been extensively explored for simple, accessible, inexpensive, rapid, and sensitive detection of PFASs, particularly PFOA and PFOS.

The most common approach for treating contaminated water currently relies on removal of PFAS by sorption. The spent sorbents loaded with PFAS can potentially be disposed of at landfills, provided the sorbed contaminants remain sequestered and certain risk criteria are met. Hence, it is essential that remediation sorbents (i) rapidly adsorb a large variety of PFAS under varying water chemistry conditions, and (ii) do not release the adsorbed PFAS in due course. This review aims at establishing the current state of knowledge about the potential release of PFAS that may occur during and after treatment. The scientific literature currently provides data for a very restricted range of long-chain PFAS. Our knowledge of the dynamics of PFAS adsorption processes on engineered sorbents is limited, and even less is known about their desorption processes. The sorption of PFAS can be strongly affected by changes in the solution pH, ionic strength and dissolved organic matter content, and the process is also subject to complex competition mechanisms in the presence of other PFAS as well as organic contaminants and inorganic salts. Several studies suggest that changes in one or several of these factors may trigger the release of PFAS from engineered sorbents. This phenomenon is more likely to occur for PFAS with shorter carbon chain lengths (<C8), at high pH and in the presence of other PFAS or other anionic sorbates. The release of PFAS from spent sorbent materials, stored or deposited under conditions that vary over time, is highly undesirable, as they can potentially become a secondary source of PFAS in the environment. Our analysis identifies a number of knowledge-gaps that should be urgently addressed in order to design sustainable remediation solutions, including an improved management of spent sorbent materials. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Contamination; Ionic strength; Remediation; Sorption; Water pollution; Water treatment; Carbon-chain length; Competition mechanism; Contaminated lands; Contaminated water; Desorption process; Dissolved organic matters; Organic contaminant; Scientific literature; Sorbents; activated carbon; benzoic acid derivative; covalent organic framework; dissolved organic matter; metal organic framework; pentafluorobenzoic acid; perfluorobutane sulfonic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; activated carbon; chemical compound; contaminated land; desorption; dissolved organic matter; ion exchange; landfill; remediation; resin; waste management; water treatment; aquifer; binding site; bioremediation; carbon sequestration; compression; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; ionic strength; kinetic parameters; landfill; leaching; peer review; pH; Review; static electricity"

It also analyzes the influence of fluorinated ligands on the catalytic activity of the complexes. The choice, structure and positions of fluorinated substituents in NHC ligands are generally dictated by the desire to increase the electrophilicity of the ruthenium atom due to the electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine atoms and fluoroalkyl groups, resulting, as a rule, in an increase in the activity of the ruthenium complex. In catalysts with unsymmetrical fluorine-containing NHC ligands, there is a possibility of additional Ru-F coordination, making the complexes much more stable and, consequently, more active. The presence of fluorine in chelating alkylidene ligands provides an increase in the catalyst initiation rate due to a weakening of the ruthenium-heteroatom bond. Besides, the introduction of polyfluoroalkyl groups into ligands solves the problem of catalyst recovery using fluorous biphasic systems for reuse.

Though they are currently being phased out, their persistence in the environment is widespread. There is increasing evidence linking PFAS exposure to health effects, an issue of concern since PFAS such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooc-tanoic acid (PFOA) bioaccumulate in humans, with a half-life of years. Many epidemiological studies suggest that, worldwide, semen quality has decreased over the past several decades. One of the most worrying effects of PFOS and PFOA is their associations with lower testosterone levels, similar to clinical observations in infertile men. This review thus focuses on PFOS/PFOA-associated effects on male reproductive health. The sources of PFAS in drinking water are listed. The current epide-miological studies linking increased exposure to PFAS with lowered testosterone and semen quality, and evidence from rodent studies supporting their function as endocrine disruptors on the reproductive system, exhibiting non-monotonic dose responses, are noted. Finally, their mechanisms of action and possible toxic effects on the Leydig, Sertoli, and germ cells are discussed. Future research efforts must consider utilizing better human model systems for exposure, using more accurate PFAS exposure susceptibility windows, and improvements in statistical modeling of data to account for the endocrine disruptor properties of PFAS. © 2021 by the authors.

A 46-year-old woman suffered orbital trauma after a motor vehicle accident as a teenager and the fracture was repaired with Teflon implant. Thirty-two years later, she presented with lower eyelid fistula, ectropion, and retraction. A 65-year-old woman also previously had Teflon implants for the repair of her left inferior and lateral orbital rim after a motor vehicle accident. Twenty-five years later, she presented with chronic infections involving the repaired areas, as well as left lower lid ectropion and fistula formation.

Emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment such as antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) possess inherent properties that enables them to evade water treatment processes. Meanwhile, the inability of low-budget communities to access clean water have been overemphasized. Therefore, developing new or improving existing tools for the management of ARB/ARGs contaminated water for low-income countries requires the collaboration of all stakeholders including business, government and the academia. This review highlights and evaluates the current technologies (adsorption, coagulation, and membrane filtration), and the prevailing mechanism, that can effectively serve this purpose in low-income communities. This report identified the knowledge gaps inherent in these water treatment technologies and provided plausible systematic approaches to overcome some of these challenges.

Most cases are sporadic (>95% of cases) after the age of 65 years, implicating an important role of environmental factors in disease pathogenesis. Environmental neurotoxicants have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's Disease and AD. Animal models of AD and in vitro studies have shed light on potential neuropathological mechanisms, yet the biochemical and molecular underpinnings of AD-relevant environmental neurotoxicity remain poorly understood. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a potentially critical pathogenic target of environmentally induced neurotoxicity. BACE1 clearly has a critical role in AD pathophysiology: It is required for amyloid beta production and expression and activity of BACE1 are increased in the AD brain. Though the literature on BACE1 in response to environmental insults is limited, current studies, along with extensive AD neurobiology literature suggest that BACE1 deserves attention as an important neurotoxic target. Here, we critically review research on environmental neurotoxicants such as metals, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, polyfluoroalkyl substances, heterocyclic aromatic amines, advanced glycation end products, and acrolein that modulate BACE1 and potential mechanisms of action. Though more research is needed to clearly understand whether BACE1 is a critical mediator of AD-relevant neurotoxicity, available reports provide convincing evidence that BACE1 is altered by environmental risk factors associated with AD pathology, implying that BACE1 inhibition and its use as a biomarker should be considered in AD management and research. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","acrolein; advanced glycation end product; alkyl group; amyloid beta protein; aromatic amine; beta secretase 1; fungicide; herbicide; metal derivative; pesticide; aspartic proteinase; BACE1 protein, human; neurotoxin; secretase; aging; Alzheimer disease; environmental exposure; enzyme activity; human; in vitro study; mild cognitive impairment; neurobiology; neuropathology; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; protein expression; protein function; protein protein interaction; Review; risk factor; upregulation; adverse event; aged; animal; biosynthesis; brain; disease model; environmental exposure; enzymology; female; gene expression regulation; male; pathology; toxicity and intoxication; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Animals; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Environmental Exposure; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Humans; Male; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Neurotoxins"

Electron beam (EB) is a common type of irradiation used in wastewater treatment, as it has the ability to create free radicals to break down chemical bonds, which is beneficial for treating modern wastewater complex matrix. As a result, many systems have been developed that make EB cheaper and easier to scale up. This paper reviews the application of EB in wastewater treatment along with many factors (especially scavengers) attributing to the effectiveness of this treatment. It has been proven that EB is used in a variety of ways and is ultimately effective in wastewater treatments. However, in order to achieve high efficiency, EB has been utilized in a relatively high dose, which results from the competition between scavengers and target compounds and the complex structure of many organic compounds. Also, the subordinate radical forming also plays an important role in the pollutants degradation by using EB when there is still a limitation in this field. It is important to perform more research on scavengers and secondary radicals in order to overcome the limitation of EB and make it become state-of-the-art technology. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Bond strength (chemical); Electron beams; Free radicals; Pollution; Reclamation; Chemical complexity; Complex matrices; Complex structure; Conventional methods; Emerging pollutants; High-efficiency; State-of-the-art technology; Wastewater treatment technologies; Wastewater treatment; concentration (composition); electron; irradiation; radical; wastewater treatment; Lethrinidae"

Previous studies mainly focused on the dose-response relationship and cytotoxic effects of pollutants to organisms，while little research focused on pollutant-protein interactions at molecular level. However, the binding of organic pollutants to biomolecules, especially proteins like transporters, membrane receptor and nuclear receptors, is often the first step of toxic effects. It can make a series of endocrine disrupting and genotoxic effects through cell signaling pathway by binding specific target proteins including serum albumin, thyroid transporter, estrogen receptor, androgen receptor, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Thus, the research of interactions between organic pollutants and proteins is helpful and necessary to understand the distribution, metabolism and toxicity mechanism of compounds in organisms at the molecular level. This paper reviewed the latest research progress of the interaction types of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), emerging pollutants and some other pollutants with targeted proteins.

Despite the complex nature of the diseases, there is long-standing, and growing, evidence linking microbial infection to the development of AD dementia, which we summarize in this article. Also, we highlight emerging research findings that support a role for parainfection in the pathophysiology of AMD, a disease of the neurosensory retina that has been shown to share risk factors and pathological features with AD. Acute neurological infections, such as Bacterial Meningitis (BM), trigger inflammatory events that permanently change how the brain functions, leading to lasting cognitive impairment. Neuroinflammation likewise is a known pathological event that occurs in the early stages of chronic age-related neurodegenerative diseases AD and AMD and might be triggered as a parainfectious event. To date, at least 16 microbial pathogens have been linked to the development of AD; on the other hand, investigation of a microbe-AMD relationship is in its infancy. This mini-review article provides a synthesis of existing evidence indicating a contribution of parainfection in the aetiology of AD and of emerging findings that support a similar process in AMD. Subsequently, it describes the major immunopathological mechanisms that are common to BM and AD/AMD. Together, this evidence leads to our proposal that both AD and AMD may have an infectious aetiology that operates through a dysregulated inflammatory response, leading to deleterious outcomes. Last, it draws fresh insights from the existing literature about potential therapeutic options for BM that might alleviate neurological disruption associated with infections, and which could, by extension, be explored in the context of AD and AMD. © Copyright © 2021 Too, Hunt and Simunovic.","alternative complement pathway C3 C5 convertase; amyloid beta protein; apolipoprotein E; C reactive protein; chemokine; complement; complement component C3; complement component C3b receptor; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement factor H; complement factor I; cytokine; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; membrane cofactor protein; nucleotide binding oligomerization domain like receptor; presenilin 1; presenilin 2; toll like receptor; toll like receptor 2; tumor necrosis factor; vasculotropin inhibitor; age related macular degeneration; Alzheimer disease; bacterial meningitis; Candida albicans; central nervous system infection; Chlamydia pneumoniae; cryptococcal meningitis; cytokine storm; Cytomegalovirus; dementia; Epstein Barr virus; genetic linkage; genetic polymorphism; Helicobacter pylori; Hepatitis C virus; heredity; homeostasis; human; Human alphaherpesvirus 1; Human herpesvirus 6; Human immunodeficiency virus; immune dysregulation; immune response; immunosenescence; infection; lead poisoning; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Neisseria meningitidis; nervous system inflammation; oxidative stress; parainfection; Review; risk factor; systematic review; Toxoplasma gondii; traumatic brain injury; Varicella zoster virus"

They occupy the highest trophic positions in their food chains and are documented to bioaccumulate high concentrations of persistent pollutants such as toxic metals and legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs).Whereas raptors played a critical role in developing awareness of and policy for chemical pollution, they have thus far played a much smaller role in current research on contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Given the critical knowledge obtained from monitoring ‘legacy contaminants’ in raptors, more information on the levels and effects of CECs on raptors is urgently needed. This study critically reviews studies on raptors from Europe reporting the occurrence of CECs with focus on the investigated species, the sampled matrices, and the bioanalytical methods applied. Based on this, we aimed to identify future needs for monitoring CECs in Europe. Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), novel flame retardants (NFRs), and to a lesser extent UV-filters, neonicotinoids, chlorinated paraffins, parabens and bisphenols have been reported in European raptors. White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), Peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) were the most frequently studied raptor species. Among matrices, eggs, feathers and plasma were the most widely employed, although the potential role of the preen gland as an excretory organ for CECs has recently been proposed. This review highlights the following research priorities for pollution research on raptors in Europe: 1) studies covering all the main classes of CECs; 2) research in other European regions (mainly East Europe); 3) identification of the most suitable matrices and species for the analysis of different CECs; and 4) the application of alternative sample treatment strategies (e.g. QuEChERS or pressurized liquid extraction) is still limited and conventional solvent-extraction is the preferred choice. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Birds; Flame retardants; Solvent extraction; Bioanalytical methods; Chlorinated paraffins; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Environmental pollutions; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Persistent organic pollutants; Pressurized liquid extraction; Research priorities; Organic pollutants; 1,2 bis(2,4,6 tribromophenoxy)ethane; 2 ethylhexyl 2,3,4,5 tetrabromobenzoic acid; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzoic acid; benzyl paraben; bis(2 ethylhexyl) 3,4,5,6 tetrabromo phthalic acid; bisphenol AF; bisphenol F; bisphenol S; bisphenol Z; butyl paraben; decabromodiphenyl ethane; dechlorane; dechlorane plus; flame retardant; long carbon chain paraffin; medium carbon chain paraffin; organofluorine derivative; paraffin; pentylparaben; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; phenol derivative; phenylparaben; phthalic acid; propyl paraben; short carbon chain paraffin; unclassified drug; flame retardant; chemical pollutant; concentration (composition); extraction method; flame retardant; persistent organic pollutant; plasma; raptor; solvent; Accipiter gentilis; Belgium; bioaccumulation; blood; body fat; concentration (parameter); egg; Falco peregrinus; falcon; feather; food availability; Haliaeetus albicilla; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liver; nonhuman; Norway; peer review; persistent organic pollutant; priority journal; pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry; raptor; Review; sediment; solvent extraction; Spain; Sweden; toxicity testing; trend study; trophic level; animal; environmental monitoring; Europe; pollutant; Europe; Accipiter gentilis; Falco peregrinus; Haliaeetus albicilla; Raptores; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Europe; Flame Retardants; Raptors"

These problems can both be potentially solvedviaa bifunctional catalytic system with integrated components that can directly convert CO2into hydrocarbons. There are two possible reaction pathways involved in this catalytic system, but compared to the reverse water gas shift-Fischer Tropsch synthesis (RWGS-FTS) route, the methanol route potentially has a higher selectivity of desired products due to its ability to overcome the restriction of the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) distribution. The methanol route requires bifunctional catalysts consisting of metal/metal oxide and zeolite components. The former is used to convert CO2into methanol, whereas the latter is used to convert methanol into hydrocarbons. This review first discusses the development of metal/metal oxide single component catalysts to enhance the hydrogenation of CO2, methanol selectivity, and methanol yield. Next, the development of zeolite single-component catalysts for the methanol to hydrocarbon (MTH) reaction by minimising coke formation and tuning the hydrocarbon selectivity is discussed, and finally the development of integrated bifunctional catalystsviathe methanol route is introduced. Overall, although bifunctional catalytic systems can successfully achieve the desired product selectivity for all hydrocarbons, they suffer from high CO selectivity at a high operating temperature, which needs to be addressed to enhance the yield and selectivity of a specific hydrocarbon. At this stage, it could not be confirmed if bifunctional catalytic systems can effectively decrease the CO2content globally, while acting as an effective alternative hydrocarbon source until a complete life cycle analysis is conducted. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that bifunctional catalytic systems demonstrate much better potential and benefits than separate multi-step catalysts in different reactors because under the same reaction conditions, bifunctional catalysts demonstrate higher CO2conversion and lower CO selectivity than single metal/metal oxide catalysts and longer catalyst lifetimes than single zeolite catalysts, while maintaining selectivity for desired hydrocarbon products. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.","Carbon dioxide; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogenation; Life cycle; Methanol; Water gas shift; Zeolites; Anderson-Schulz-Flory distributions; Bi-functional catalysts; Carbon dioxide hydrogenation; High operating temperature; Methanol-to-hydrocarbons; Product selectivities; Reverse water gas shift; Single-component catalysts; Catalyst selectivity"

These specifically in-clude polymers built with either substituted alicyclic structures or aromatic rings, or both. In this review article, we highlight two useful ring-forming polymer groups, perfluorocyclobutyl (PFCB) aryl ether polymers and ortho-diynylarene-(ODA) based thermosets, both demonstrating outstand-ing thermal stability, chemical resistance, mechanical integrity, and improved processability.

MBL (mannose-binding lectin) is part of the innate immune system (IIS), which is the host’s first line defense against pathogens. The IIS functions centrally by identifying pathogen-specific microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) with the help of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Studies have classified mannose-binding lectin (MBL) as one of the PRR molecules which belong to the C-type lectin family. The protective role of MBL lies in its ability to activate the complement system via the lectin pathway and there seems to be a direct link between the chicken’s health status and the MBL concentration in the serum. Several methods have been used to detect the presence, the level and the structure of MBL in chickens such as Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) among others. The concentration of MBL in the chicken ranges from 0.4 to 35 µg/mL and can be at peak levels at three to nine days at entry of pathogens. The variations observed are known to depend on the bacterial strains, breed and age of the chicken and possibly the feed manipulation strategies. However, when chicken MBL (cMBL) becomes deficient, it can result in malfunctioning of the innate immune system, which can predispose chickens to diseases. This article aimed to discuss the importance and components of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) in chickens, its mode of actions, and the different methods used to detect MBL. Therefore, more studies are recommended to explore the causes for low and high cMBL production in chicken breeds and the possible effect of feed manipulation strategies in enhancing cMBL production. © 2021 by the authors.

Effective design of the catalyst plays a significant role in enhancing syngas conversion, selectivity towards C5+ hydrocar-bons, and decreasing selectivity towards methane. This work presents a review on catalyst design and the most employed support materials in FTS to synthesize heavier hydrocarbons. Furthermore, in this report, the recent achievements on mechanisms of this reaction will be discussed. Catalyst deactivation is one of the most important challenges during FTS, which will be covered in this work. The selectivity of FTS can be tuned by operational conditions, nature of the catalyst, support, and reactor configuration. The effects of all these parameters will be analyzed within this report. More-over, zeolites can be employed as a support material of an FTS-based catalyst to direct synthesis of liquid fuels, and the specific character of zeolites will be elaborated further.

The market revenues also show an historic growth worldwide motivated by the increase on the drug demand. However, this positivism on the market is fogged because the discharge of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites into the environment, including water, also increases due to their inappropriate management, treatment and disposal; now, worldwide, this fact is recognized as an environmental concern and human health risk. Intriguingly, researchers have studied the most effective methods for pharmaceutical removal in wastewater; however, the types of pharmaceuticals investigated in most of these studies do not reflect the most produced and consumed pharmaceuticals on the market. Hence, an attempt was done to analyze the pharmaceutical market, drugs consumption trends and the pharmaceutical research interests worldwide. Notwithstanding, the intensive research work done in different pharmaceutical research fronts such as disposal and fate, environmental impacts and concerns, human health risks, removal, degradation and development of treatment technologies, found that such research is not totally aligned with the market trends and consumption patterns. There are other drivers and interests that promote the pharmaceutical research.

Many communities have had water contaminated by PFAS, and cancer is one of the important community concerns related to PFAS exposure. Objectives: We critically reviewed the evidence relating to PFAS and cancer from an epidemiologic standpoint to highlight directions for future research that would be the most likely to meaningfully increase knowledge. Methods: We conducted a search in PubMed for studies of cancer and PFAS (through 9/20/2020). We identified epidemiologic studies that provided a quantitative estimate for some measure of the association between PFAS and cancer. Here, we review that literature, including several aspects of epidemiologic study design that impact the usefulness of study results. Results: We identified 16 cohort (or case-cohort) studies, 10 case-control studies (4 nested within cohorts and 6 non-nested), 1 cross sectional study and 1 ecologic study. The cancer sites with the most evidence of an association with PFAS are testicular and kidney cancer. There are also some suggestions in a few studies of an association with prostate cancer, but the data are inconsistent. Discussion: Each study's design has strengths and limitations. Weaknesses in study design and methods can, in some cases, lead to questionable associations, but in other cases can make it more difficult to detect true associations, if they are present. Overall, the evidence for an association between cancer and PFAS remains sparse. A variety of studies with different strengths and weaknesses can be helpful to clarify associations between PFAS and cancer. Long term follow-up of large-sized cohorts with large exposure contrasts are most likely to be informative. © 2021","perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; water; adult; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer localization; case control study; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; human; kidney cancer; male; malignant neoplasm; Medline; priority journal; prostate cancer; quantitative analysis; Review; systematic review; testis cancer; kidney tumor; pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Water"

The uniqueness of these oxide materials is in their ability to harness energy in the UV/Vis range, their relative ease of synthesis, low cost, and their general high surface ratio to mass, etc. Thus, these materials have consequently drawn much profound interest in environment applications, particularly pharmaceutical drugs for photocatalytic degradation. Furthermore, the non-toxic nature of most metal oxide semiconductors means they are convenient for water treatment works, resulting in safe drinking water for humans and safe environments for aquatic mammals. Pharmaceuticals are emerging pollutants that are increasingly being found in water systems. They have been detrimental to the human and animal health. In this article, pharmaceutical drugs abatement from water via photocatalysis process using oxide-based advanced metals such as TiO2, ZnO, Fe2O3,WO3, and Bi2WO6 is discussed. Degradation of various drugs at laboratory scale have been assessed and examples cited.

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are isotactic polymers that play a critical role in the central metabolism of producer bacteria, as they act as dynamic reservoirs of carbon and reducing equivalents. PHAs continue to attract industrial attention as a starting point toward renewable, biodegradable, biocompatible, and versatile thermoplastic and elastomeric materials. Pseudomonas species have been known for long as efficient biopolymer producers, especially for medium-chain-length PHAs. The surge of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering approaches in recent years offers the possibility of exploiting the untapped potential of Pseudomonas cell factories for the production of tailored PHAs. In this article, an overview of the metabolic and regulatory circuits that rule PHA accumulation in Pseudomonas putida is provided, and approaches leading to the biosynthesis of novel polymers (e.g., PHAs including nonbiological chemical elements in their structures) are discussed. The potential of novel PHAs to disrupt existing and future market segments is closer to realization than ever before.

Based on information for a few relatively well-understood PFAS such as perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoate, there is ample basis to suspect that at least a subset can be considered persistent, bioaccumulative, and/or toxic. However, data suitable for determining risks in either prospective or retrospective assessments are lacking for the majority of PFAS. In August 2019, the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry sponsored a workshop that focused on the state-of-the-science supporting risk assessment of PFAS. The present review summarizes discussions concerning the ecotoxicology and ecological risks of PFAS. First, we summarize currently available information relevant to problem formulation/prioritization, exposure, and hazard/effects of PFAS in the context of regulatory and ecological risk assessment activities from around the world. We then describe critical gaps and uncertainties relative to ecological risk assessments for PFAS and propose approaches to address these needs. Recommendations include the development of more comprehensive monitoring programs to support exposure assessment, an emphasis on research to support the formulation of predictive models for bioaccumulation, and the development of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods to efficiently assess biological effects for potentially sensitive species/endpoints. Addressing needs associated with assessing the ecological risk of PFAS will require cross-disciplinary approaches that employ both conventional and new methods in an integrated, resource-effective manner.

Perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs) and perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) are the most studied PFAAs due to their global occurrence. PFAAs are environmentally persistent, toxic, and the long-chain homologs are also bioaccumulative. Exposure to PFAAs may arise directly from emission or indirectly via the environmental release and degradation of PFAA precursors. Precursors themselves or their conversion intermediates can present deleterious effects, including hepatotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, and genetic toxicity. Therefore, exposure to PFAA precursors constitutes a potential hazard for environmental contamination. In order to comprehensively evaluate the environmental fate and effects of PFAA precursors and their connection with PFSAs and PFCAs, we review environmental biodegradability studies carried out with microbial strains, activated sludge, plants, and earthworms over the past decade. In particular, we review perfluorooctyl-sulfonamide-based precursors, including perfluroooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and its N-ethyl derivative (EtFOSA), N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido ethanol (EtFOSE), and EtFOSE-based phosphate diester (DiSAmPAP). Fluorotelomerization-based precursors are also reviewed, including fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOH), fluorotelomer sulfonates (FTSA), and a suite of their transformation products. Though limited information is currently available on zwitterionic PFAS precursors, a preliminary review of data available for 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide betaine (FTAB) was also conducted. Furthermore, we update and refine the recent knowledge on biotransformation strategies with a focus on metabolic pathways and mechanisms involved in the biotransformation of PFAA precursors. The biotransformation of PFAA precursors mainly involves the cleavage of carbon-fluorine (C–F) bonds and the degradation of non-fluorinated functional groups via oxidation, dealkylation, and defluorination to form shorter-chained PFAAs. Based on the existing research, the current problems and future research directions on the biotransformation of PFAA precursors are proposed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biodegradability; Physicochemical properties; Sulfur compounds; Toxicity; Developmental toxicity; Environmental contamination; Fluorotelomer alcohols; Future research directions; Perfluorocarboxylic acid; Perfluorosulfonic acid; Reproductive toxicities; Transformation products; Bioconversion; alcohol derivative; ampholyte; fluorotelomer alcohol; fluorotelomer sulfonamide betaine; fluorotelomer sulfonate; industrial chemical; n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide; n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido ethanol; organophosphate; perfluoroalkyl acid; perfluorocarboxylic acid; perfluorooctyl sulfonamide; perfluorosulfonic acid; perfluroooctane sulfonamide; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; bioremediation; biotransformation; degradation; environmental fate; metabolism; organofluorine; toxicity; activated sludge; biodegradability; biotransformation; chemical bond; chemical reaction; dealkylation; defluorination; earthworm; ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; fluorotelomerization; human; nonhuman; oxidation; plant; pollution; bioaccumulation; biotransformation; environmental monitoring; sewage; Alkanesulfonates; Bioaccumulation; Biotransformation; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Sewage"

In 2016, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) established nonregulatory drinking water Health Advisories of 70 ng/L for individual and total concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), the 8-carbon perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) that are the most thoroughly studied PFAS. As of May 2020, 9 US states had concluded that the USEPA Health Advisories are insufficiently protective and developed more stringent PFOA and PFOS guidelines. In addition, 10 states had developed guidelines for other PFAS, primarily PFAAs. This Critical Review discusses the scientific basis for state and USEPA drinking water guidelines for PFOA and PFOS; the same principles apply to guidelines for other PFAS. Similarities and differences among guidelines arise from both toxicity and exposure considerations. The approximately 4-fold range among state guidelines (8–35 ng/L for PFOA, 10–40 ng/L for PFOS) is not large or unexpected for guidelines developed by different scientists at different time points, especially when compared with older USEPA and state guidelines that were generally several orders of magnitude higher. Additional state guidelines for PFOA, PFOS, and other PFAS are expected to become available.

The goals of the present review are to assess the state of the science regarding toxicological effects of PFAS and to develop strategies for advancing knowledge on the health effects of this large family of chemicals. Currently, much of the toxicity data available for PFAS are for a handful of chemicals, primarily legacy PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate. Epidemiological studies have revealed associations between exposure to specific PFAS and a variety of health effects, including altered immune and thyroid function, liver disease, lipid and insulin dysregulation, kidney disease, adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes, and cancer. Concordance with experimental animal data exists for many of these effects. However, information on modes of action and adverse outcome pathways must be expanded, and profound differences in PFAS toxicokinetic properties must be considered in understanding differences in responses between the sexes and among species and life stages. With many health effects noted for a relatively few example compounds and hundreds of other PFAS in commerce lacking toxicity data, more contemporary and high-throughput approaches such as read-across, molecular dynamics, and protein modeling are proposed to accelerate the development of toxicity information on emerging and legacy PFAS, individually and as mixtures. In addition, an appropriate degree of precaution, given what is already known from the PFAS examples noted, may be needed to protect human health.

The distribution of temperature affects the radiation flux of long-wave and short-wave, which in turn plays a significant role in the balance of global energy radiation budget. Therefore, understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of atmospheric temperature and its long-term variation comprehensively are essential for our research on weather forecast and climate change research. Presently, many ground-based and space borne sensors have been developed for temperature detection. Space borne sensors observe temperature by nadir viewing, occultation detection, or limb sounding. Space borne sensors have a high spatial and temporal resolution, which can provide sufficient data for scientific research. In this paper, seven foreign hyperspectral sensors (IMG, AIRS, IASI, HALOE, HALOE, TES, MIPAS, ACE-FTS) and domestic sensors (the series of FY and GF) are introduced in terms of parameters, performance, and application. These sensors acquire the information of atmospheric parameters through the radiation in infrared band. Occultation and limb observation are less affected by the underlying surface and have high vertical resolution and sensitivity, such as HALOE, MIPAS, ACE-FTS, TES, etc. So far, the accuracy of temperature products of nadir observation (AIRS and IASI) is less than 1K with a vertical direction of 1 km, and the accuracy of temperature products in the troposphere by TES limb observation can reach 0.5 K. All of them meet the requirement of Numerical Weather Prediction and can be used widely in weather forecasting and climate change research. The accuracy of temperature profiles of the Feng Yun series is comparable to that of IASI, but the spatial and temporal resolution are needed to be improved. The radiation transfer is the basis for trace gas inversion. Firstly, we introduced the radiation transfer equations of nadir viewing, occultation detection, or limb sounding. The radiation transfer process of limb observation is similar to that of occultation detection, in which line-of-sight reaching a down-looking sensor is entirely above the ground. Then, three retrieval methods (statistical regression, physical inversion, and artificial neural network inversion) of temperature profile are described in terms of principles, characteristics, and development history. The advantages and disadvantages of them are also compared. The statistical regression method is simple and efficient, but the accuracy is relatively lower, which is usually used as the a priori profiles for the physical algorithm. The accuracy of physical inversion is improved obviously, but the retrieval process of is complex and the a priori profiles are needed in physical inversion. The artificial neural network method can acquire the temperature profile accurately and efficiently, but a variety of samples are needed for training. Meanwhile, the key problems that the influence of the cloud, aerosol, and surface reflectivity on temperature retrieval are described, and the possible solutions are then given, respectively. The generation and propagation of error (smoothness, model parameter, and measurement error) in temperature retrieval are summarized. Finally, the problems existing in atmospheric temperature inversion are proposed. © 2021, Science Press.

However, very few studies have focused on modeling PFAS in the soil-water environment. In this review, we summarized the recent development in PFAS modeling for various chemical, physical, and biological processes, including sorption, volatilization, degradation, bioaccumulation, and transport. PFAS sorption is kinetic in nature with sorption equilibrium commonly quantified by either a linear, the Freundlich, or the Langmuir isotherms. Volatilization of PFAS depends on carbon chain length and ionization status and has been simulated by a two-layer diffusion process across the air water interface. First-order kinetics is commonly used for physical, chemical, and biological degradation processes. Uptake by plants and other biota can be passive and/or active. As surfactants, PFAS have a tendency to be sorbed or concentrated on air-water or non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL)-water interfaces, where the same three isotherms for soil sorption are adopted. PFAS transport in the soil-water environment is simulated by solving the convection-dispersion equation (CDE) that is coupled to PFAS sorption, phase transfer, as well as physical, chemical, and biological transformations. As the physicochemical properties and concentration vary greatly among the potentially thousands of PFAS species in the environment, systematic efforts are needed to identify models and model parameters to simulate their fate, transport, and response to remediation techniques. Since many process formulations are empirical in nature, mechanistic approaches are needed to further the understanding of PFAS-soil-water-plant interactions so that the model parameters are less site dependent and more predictive in simulating PFAS remediation efficiency. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air; Biochemistry; Degradation; Ionization of liquids; Isotherms; Physicochemical properties; Remediation; Soil moisture; Solute transport; Sorption; Air water interfaces; Biological degradation; Biological transformation; Convection-dispersion equations; First order kinetics; Nonaqueous phase liquids; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Remediation efficiency; Phase interfaces; carbon; organofluorine derivative; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; surfactant; unclassified drug; water; critical analysis; diffusion; hydrological modeling; reaction kinetics; soil remediation; soil water; soil-vegetation interaction; sorption; transport process; volatilization; air; bioaccumulation; bioremediation; biotransformation; concentration (parameter); degradation; desorption; diffusion; dispersion; ionization; isotherm; Michaelis Menten kinetics; physical chemistry; priority journal; Review; simulation; soil; thermodynamics; volatilization"

Considering the detrimental impact of pollutants on human health and ecosystem, their detection in different media including water is paramount. Notably, electrochemical techniques are more appealing owing to their recognized advantages. This research summarizes and evaluates the most recent advances in the electrochemical sensing of environmental pollutants such as heavy metal ions, pesticides, nitroaromatics, and other distinct emerging contaminants. Besides, the review focuses on the application of electrochemical detection of the selected pollutants through analysis of representative reports in the five years from 2016 to 2020. Therefore, the review is intended to contribute insights and guidelines to contemporary progress in specific electrochemical application practices based on graphene derivatives, toward the aforenamed pollutants. Thus, it focused on sensing methods such as cyclic voltammetry, anodic stripping voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy employing different sensing elements incorporating graphene. Moreover, the review also highlighted graphene synthesis pathways, sensor design strategies, and functionalization. Furthermore, the review showed that there is congruence in the literature that functionalized graphene and its derivatives remain as viable modifiers in electrochemical sensing of pollutants. Nonetheless, the study also appraised the absence of literature reports on electrochemical detection of natural organic matter substances like humic acid and fulvic acid using a graphene-based sensor. In reckoning, current challenges related to graphene synthesis and applicability, envisaged opportunities, and future perspectives are outlined. © Copyright © 2021 Kumunda, Adekunle, Mamba, Hlongwa and Nkambule.","Agricultural robots; Aromatic compounds; Chemical detection; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrochemical sensors; Graphene; Heavy metals; Metal ions; Organic acids; Pesticides; Water pollution; Water quality; Anodic stripping voltammetry; Electrochemical applications; ELectrochemical detection; Electrochemical techniques; Environmental challenges; Environmental pollutants; Functionalized graphene; Natural organic matters; Pollution detection"

Additionally, nine contemporary techniques such as field scale evaluation, watershed scale evaluation, strategies to identify critical source areas, optimization strategies for placement of best management practices (BMPs), social component in watershed modeling, machine learning algorithms to address water quality problems in complex natural systems concomitant with spatial heterogeneity, establishing a total maximum daily loads (TMDLs), remote sensing in monitoring water quality, and developing water quality index are discussed. Next, the existing barriers to improve water quality are classified into primary and secondary impediments. A detail discussion of three primary impediments (climate change, urbanization and industrial activities, and agriculture) and ten secondary impediments (availability of water quality data, complexity of system, lack of skilled person, environmental legislation, fragmented mandate, limitation in resources, environmental awareness, resistance to change, alteration of nutrient ratio by river damming, and emerging pollutants) are illustrated.

Originally found fascinating for its luminescent properties, it has emerged at the forefront for organic electronics due to its particularly high charge carrier mobility for an organic crystal. Despite great interest and its explosion in the literature over the past two decades, the commercial synthesis of rubrene has remained relatively unchanged since its initial discovery in 1926. Several recent studies have reported alternate routes to the rubrene structure with substitutions on the peripheral aromatic rings and tetracene core. Substituting in this manner has the potential to improve upon rubrene's electronic properties. We review the various routes to rubrene and its derivatives and provide a brief overview of the solid-state library available for study. The information gained by comparing the solid-state properties between derivatives offers insight into unpredictable crystallization and polymorphism - complicated issues - which have hindered research into materials applications of rubrene.

Many industry compounds, due to their important commercial value and numerous ap-plications, are produced on a global scale, while the mechanism of their endocrine action has not been fully understood. In recent years, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have gained the interest of major international health organizations, and thus more and more studies have been aimed to explain the toxicity of these compounds. PFASs were firstly synthesized in the 1950s and broadly used in the industry in the production of firefighting agents, cosmetics and herbicides. The numerous industrial applications of PFASs, combined with the exceptionally long half-life of these substances in the human body and extreme environmental persistence, result in a common and chronic exposure of the general population to their action. Available data have suggested that human exposure to PFASs can occur during different stages of development and may cause short-or/and long-term health effects. This paper synthetizes the current literature reports on the presence, bioaccumulation and, particularly, endocrine toxicity of selected long-and short-chain PFASs, with a special emphasis on the mechanisms underlying their endocrine actions. © 2021 by the author.

Organically complexed minerals have many advantages over inorganic sources. It has improved absorption and efficacy, which meets the bird's requirements comfortably with a low-dose level. Hence, inorganic forms can be replaced with lower-dose levels of organic minerals without any adverse effects on production performances in broilers and layers. PFAs possess medicinal properties, such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, adaptogenic, and immunomodulatory, therefore, could be recommended as supplements. They are also growth promoters that enhance the overall health status and augment poultry birds' production performance. Furthermore, the tremendous potential of PFAs could be extracted with the recent advances in science and technology. With the advantages of organically complexed minerals and multiple beneficial applications, there is a resurgence to develop PFAs as a cocktail of organic minerals to improve the overall health status of poultry birds and augment their productivity, which, in turn, helps the poultry industry to grow decisively and economically. © Bhagwat, et al.

The complement system, a crucial first response of the host immune system, is effective in targeting viruses and virus-infected cells, and boosting the antiviral innate and acquired immune responses. Thus, the system imposes a strong selection pressure on viruses. Consequently, viruses have evolved multiple countermeasures against host complement. A major mechanism employed by viruses to subvert the complement system is encoding proteins that target complement. Since viruses have limited genome size, most of these proteins are multifunctional in nature.

In addition to other factors such as smoking, air pollution and atopy, some environmental chemicals are shown or suspected to increase the risk of asthma, exacerbate asthma symptoms and cause other respiratory symptoms. In this scoping review, we report environmental chemicals, prioritized for investigation in the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU), which are associated or possibly associated with asthma. The substance groups con-sidered to cause asthma through specific sensitization include: diisocyanates, hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) and possibly p-phenylenediamine (p-PDA). In epidemiological studies, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organophosphate insecticides are associated with asthma, and phthalates, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), pyrethroid insecticides, mercury, cad-mium, arsenic and lead are only potentially associated with asthma. As a conclusion, exposure to PAHs and some pesticides are associated with increased risk of asthma. Diisocyanates and Cr(VI) cause asthma with specific sensitization. For many environmental chemicals, current studies have provided contradicting results in relation to increased risk of asthma.

The very large number of CECs reported in the literature makes it difficult to interpret potential risks as well as the removal efficiencies, especially for the more recalci-trant compounds. As such, there is a need for indicator compounds that are representative of CECs detected in systems worldwide. In an effort to develop such a list, five criteria were used to address the potential for applying indicator compounds; these criteria include usage, occurrence, resistance to treatment, persistence, and physicochemical properties that shed light on the potential degradability of a class of compounds. Additional constraints applied included the feasibility of procuring and analyzing compounds. In total, 22 CECs belonging to 13 groups were selected as indicator compounds. These compounds include acetaminophen and ibuprofen (analgesic); erythromycin, sulfamethox-azole, and trimethoprim (antibiotics); diazepam and fluoxetine (antidepressants); carbamazepine (antiepileptic); atenolol and propranolol (β-blockers); gemfibrozil (blood lipid regulator); tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP) (fire retardant); cotinine (nicotine metabolite); atrazine, metolachlor, and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) (pesticides); 17β-estradiol and cholesterol (steroids); caffeine (psychomotor stimulant); perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (surfactants); and iopromide (X-ray contrast agent). These thirteen groups of compounds represent CECs with the greatest resistance to treatment processes, most persistent in surface waters, and detected with significant frequency throughout the water cycle.

In some organisms, this region remains part of the dcw cluster, but in others, it appears as an independent operon. A well-studied protein coded from this region is the positive FtsZ regulator SepF (YlmF), which anchors FtsZ to the membrane. Recent developments have shed light on the importance of SepF in a range of species. Additionally, new studies are highlighting the importance of the other conserved genes in this neighborhood.

The present work reviews the latest findings on the formation of Medox from the reactions of synthetic (i.e., 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonate (ABTS) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT)) or natural mediators (i.e., syringaldehyde (SA), acetosyringone (AS), p-coumaric acid, and catechol) with mild oxidants such as laccase, manganese oxidants including permanganate (Mn(VII)) and MnO2, and ferrate (Fe(VI)), as well as the transformation of organic pollutants including phenols, amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organic dyes, pulp, and perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) by Medox. First, reaction kinetics and mechanisms of the oxidation of synthetic or natural mediators by these mild oxidants were summarized. Reactivity and pathways of synthetic Medox including ABTS·+, ABTS2+, HBT· or natural Medox including phenoxy radicals and quinone-type compounds reacting with different organic pollutants were then discussed.

The purpose of this study was to understand the levels and profiles of POPs in breast milk in China and assess their potential health risks among breastfed infants under six months of age. A literature review focused on China was performed for studies published from 2001 to 2020. The POP levels in breast milk along with other important variables were extracted, and then the average individual POP levels in breast milk were estimated. This review summarises the distribution of traditional and new POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), legacy brominated flame retardants (BFRs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and chlorinated paraffins (CPs) and reported notably high levels of short-chain chlorinated paraffins and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p’-DDE) in breast milk. Although the levels of traditional POPs generally declined over time, especially p,p’-DDE and beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH), women living in coastal areas, urban areas, and southern China still have a high body burden of certain POPs. In the present study, the estimated daily intake (EDI) of POPs through breastfeeding was used to evaluate the health risk for infants by comparing with acceptable levels. The findings suggested that infants born in coastal areas most likely suffered potential health risk from exposure to DDT, and the health risk of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in infants in most nationwide regions remains a concern. More importantly, the EDI of PCBs for infants exceeds the safe limit on a national scale.

Due to their persistence and potential danger to health, some old generation PFAS have been replaced by newly synthesized PFAS with the aim to use alternative compounds presumably safer for humans and the environment. Yet, the environmental pollution with PFAS remains a matter of concern worldwide and led to large-scale epidemiological studies both on plants’ workers and on exposed people in the general population. In this context, strong concern emerged concerning the potential adverse effects of PFAS on the thyroid gland. Thyroid hormones play a critical role in the regulation of metabolism, and thyroid function is related to cardiovascular disease, fertility, and fetal neurodevelopment. In vitro, ex vivo data, and epidemiological studies suggested that PFASs may disrupt the thyroid hormone system in humans, with possible negative repercussions on the outcome of pregnancy and fetal-child development. However, data on the thyroid disrupting effect of PFAS remain controversial, as well as their impact on human health in different ages of life. Aim of the present paper is to review recent data on the effects of old and new generation PFAS on thyroid homeostasis. To this purpose we collected information from in vitro studies, animal models, and in vivo data on exposed workers, general population, and pregnant women. © Copyright © 2021 Coperchini, Croce, Ricci, Magri, Rotondi, Imbriani and Chiovato.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; endocrine disruptor; iodine; leptin receptor; liothyronine; perflubutane; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; somatomedin C; surfactant; testosterone; thyroid antibody; thyroid hormone; thyroid hormone receptor; thyroid peroxidase antibody; thyrotropin; thyroxine; unclassified drug; water; alkylation; autoimmune thyroiditis; cardiovascular disease; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cytotoxicity; environmental exposure; ex vivo study; female; fertility; fetus; fluorination; food packaging; free thyroxine index; homeostasis; homeostasis model assessment; human; hyperthyroidism; hypothyroidism; in vivo study; industrial production; nerve cell differentiation; nervous system development; neural tube defect; nonhuman; pollutant; pollution; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prenatal exposure; protein synthesis; Review; signal transduction; spermatogenesis; subclinical hypothyroidism; thyroid disease; thyroid function; thyrotropin blood level; thyroxine blood level; upregulation; worker"

They can be found in drinking water, rivers, groundwater, wastewater, household dust, and soils. In this review, the current challenge and status of bioremediation of PFAs in soils was examined. While several technologies to remove PFAS from soil have been developed, including adsorption, filtration, thermal treatment, chemical oxidation/reduction and soil washing, these methods are expensive, impractical for in situ treatment, use high pressures and temperatures, with most resulting in toxic waste. Biodegradation has the potential to form the basis of a cost-effective, large scale in situ remediation strategy for PFAS removal from soils. Both fungal and bacterial strains have been isolated that are capable of degrading PFAS; however, to date, information regarding the mechanisms of degradation of PFAS is limited. Through the application of new technologies in microbial ecology, such as stable isotope probing, metagenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics there is the potential to examine and identify the biodegradation of PFAS, a process which will underpin the development of any robust PFAS bioremediation technology. © Copyright © 2021 Shahsavari, Rouch, Khudur, Thomas, Aburto-Medina and Ball.","Biodegradation; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Cost effectiveness; Groundwater; Mammals; Potable water; Soil pollution; Toxic materials; Waste treatment; Adverse health effects; Biological treatment; Bioremediation technologies; Contaminated soils; In-situ remediation; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Stable-isotope probing; Synthetic organic compounds; Soils"

Osteoporosis affects approximately 200 million people worldwide, and nearly 9 million fractures occur annually. Evidence exists that, in addition to traditional risk factors, certain environmental substances may increase the risk of osteoporosis. Methods: The European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU) is a joint program coordinating and advancing human biomonitoring in Europe. HBM4EU investigates citizens’ exposure to several environmental substances and their plausible health effects aiming to contribute to policymaking. In HBM4EU, 18 priority substances or substance groups were selected. For each, a scoping document was prepared summarizing existing knowledge and health effects. This scoping review is based on these chemical-specific scoping documents and complementary literature review. Results: A possible link between osteoporosis and the body burden of heavy metals, such as cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), and industrial chemicals such as phthalates and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) was identified. Conclusions: Evidence shows that environmental substances may be related to osteoporosis as an adverse health effect. Nevertheless, more epidemiological research on the relationship between health effects and exposure to these chemicals is needed. Study results are incoherent, and pervasive epidemiological studies regarding the chemical exposure are lacking. © 2021 by the authors.

A systematic review of the literature was conducted to clarify, starting from environmental exposure data, whether possible occupational risk factors may correlate with the onset of the disease. The guidelines for reporting systematic reviews of the “PRISMA” statement were followed and two databases, Scopus and PubMed, were used. Of the 422 studies selected with specific keywords, 32 publications were eligible, 28 of which referred to chemical agents and 4 related to night work. Conflicting data emerged among these studies. Although some compounds seemed to be more involved than others in the onset of endometriosis. Association with exposure to organochlorine compounds is the most supported by the epidemiological data, while other pesticide exposure did not show any clear correlation. Likewise, the hypothesis of a correlation with perfluoroalkyls exposure is not currently supported by data. The involvement of metals as risk factors has not been confirmed, while the role of night work, in the case of long service, seems to play an etiological role.

EC research in Southeast Asia is especially critical due to its high population density and poor sanitation infrastructure that introduce large amounts of ECs into the aquatic environment. This literature Review investigated the status of EC research in 11 Southeast Asian countries. Key pharmaceutical groups such as antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, sulfamethazine, ciprofloxacin, and lincomycin) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (diclofenac, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen) were among the most frequently studied group of ECs, while other significant groups of interests in this Review included per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and phthalate esters (PAEs). With most Southeast Asian countries having agrarian economies and the onset of climate change, the overutilization of antibiotics and pesticides to meet the commercial demand for agriculture and livestock products is a major threat to aquatic environments and even human health in this region. This Review identifies understudied emerging contaminant groups in Southeast Asia such as disinfectants and transformation byproducts and recommends future research directions for Southeast Asia, particularly focusing on seasonal trends of EC input into surface and groundwater environments. © 2022 American Chemical Society.",

Contaminant abatement in UV-ARP is most often accomplished through reaction with hydrated electrons (eaq-) produced from UV photolysis of chemical sensitizers (e.g., sulfite). In this Review, we evaluate the photochemical kinetics, substrate scope, and optimization of UV-ARP. We find that quantities typically reported in photochemical studies of natural and engineered systems are under-reported in the UV-ARP literature, especially the formation rates, scavenging capacities, and concentrations of key reactive species like eaq-. The absence of these quantities has made it difficult to fully evaluate the impact of operating conditions and the role of water matrix components on the efficiencies of UV-ARP. The UV-ARP substrate scope is weighted heavily toward contaminant classes that are resistant to degradation by advanced oxidation processes, like oxyanions and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Some studies have sought to optimize the UV-ARP treatment of these contaminants; however, a thorough evaluation of the impact of water matrix components like dissolved organic matter on these optimization strategies is needed. Overall, the data compilation, analysis, and research recommendations provided in this Review will assist the UV-ARP research community in future efforts toward optimizing UV-ARP systems, modeling the eaq-based chemical transformation kinetics, and developing new UV-ARP systems. ©",

Although such materials are widespread in water effluents, their toxicity and impacts on both human health and the ecosystems are poorly understood since there are no regulatory data for those contaminants. However, ever increasing of the socio-economic awareness and scientific information, scientists have become more concern for the Emerging Pollutants (EPs), widespread and their distribution in the environment. Their successful control represents the primary challenge to the industrial sector and academia. Therefore, developing technological advancement in eco-friendly environmental wastewater treatment strategies is a must. This drive the multi-disciplinary blend of chemical science, environmental engineering and industry to realise this concern from both an operational and public health standpoint.

They have a very wide range of applications, while they are persistent in the environment and exhibit bioaccumulative and toxic properties. Neither chemical nor biological mechanisms can decompose PFAS due to their strong C-F bonds. PFAS have shown adverse effects on various organisms, even at trace levels. Accordingly, highly sensitive and selective analytical methods are required for their tracing in biological and environmental matrices. The physicochemical properties of PFAS like surfactant characteristics and high-water solubility are unique and different from other known pollutants. Accordingly, the number of articles on the analysis of PFAS is less than the other well-known contaminants. The routine PFAS sample preparation methods (like solvent extraction) coupled with chromatographic systems, face challenges such as high limits of detection, need for laborious derivatization, limited selectivity, and expensive instrumentation. Recent efforts to address these limitations have aroused considerable attention to the development of microextraction techniques, which are consistent with the principles of green chemistry and can be made easily portable and automated. Moreover, these methods have shown enough sensitivity and selectivity for the analysis of different analytes (including PFAS) in a wide range of samples with different matrices.

Materials and Methods: This retrospective case series consisted of eight consecutive patients (four female, four male) who presented with retinal detachment (traumatic, secondary to inferior retinal tear, presence of proliferative vitreoretinopathy) at a tertiary university medical center in 2018-2019. All patients underwent pars plana vitrectomy with short-term PFD tamponade. Patients with a minimum follow-up of 3 months were included in the study. The medical charts were analyzed for patient demographics, retinal attachment rates, pre- and postoperative visual acuity, and postoperative complications. Results: The mean duration of PFD tamponade was 16.5 ± 6.3 (range, 7-27) days. The mean follow-up time for the patients was 8.63 ± 2.5 months. The retina was reattached intraoperatively in all patients. In seven patients (87.5%), the retina was still attached throughout follow-up without further vitrectomies. A statistically signifi cant increase was observed when preoperative mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was compared with mean BCVA in the last follow-up visit (2.9 ± 0.3, 1.3 ± 0.7 logMAR respectively, p=0.018). In seven (87.5%) patients, BCVA improved postoperatively compared with preoperatively. In the postoperative period, pupillary membrane formation was observed in two (25.0%) patients, retrolental membrane in one (12.5%) patient, and epiretinal membrane in one (12.5%) patient.

We aimed to examine the utility of flow cytometric platelet aggregation (FCA) assay in detecting platelet function defects (PFDs) in patients with a history of bleeding symptoms. Methods Sixty-four participants (24 patients and 40 healthy controls) were included in this study. LTA and FCA assay were performed simultaneously in patients and healthy controls. In the FCA assay, two portions of platelets from the same individual were labeled separately with CD31-FITC and CD31-PE. After mixing and stimulation with agonists, the double-colored platelet aggregates were visualized using a flow cytometer. The results generated using the two techniques were compared and correlated. Results The patients’ median age was 17 years (range, 3-72 yr) with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.7. There was substantial agreement between LTA and FCA assay in detecting a PFD (K=0.792). Four patients showing a Glanzmann thrombasthenia-like pattern on LTA exhibited an abnormal FCA. A functional defect in collagen binding was detected on the FCA assay conducted in two immune thrombocytopenic patients with severe bleeding.

Specifically, the binding affinities between PFASs and some transporters were determined, demonstrating that the TTE values of PFASs are highly dependent on their binding behaviors. To summarize primary findings of previous studies and propose potential guidance for future research, this article provides a systematic overview on levels and characteristics of prenatal exposure to PFASs worldwide, summarizes relationships between TTE values and structures of PFASs, and discusses possible transplacental transfer mechanisms, especially for the combination between PFASs and transporters. Given the critical roles of transporters in the transplacental transfer of PFASs, we conducted molecular docking to further clarify the binding behaviors between PFASs and the selected transporters. We proposed that the machine learning can be a superior method to predict and reveal behaviors and mechanisms of the transplacental transfer of PFASs.

In particular, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDC) are harmful to endocrine receptor actions and signaling in the breast tissue. Usually, there is a long interval of time between the exposure to EDC and BC incidence, and this often represents a serious obstacle for effective BC prophylaxis. Notably, during certain periods of a woman’s life cycle, the BC risk is particularly elevated due to increased susceptibility to some EDC. These windows of susceptibility (WOS) include prenatal, puberty, pregnancy, and menopausal transition stages of a female’s life course. Four WOS have been considered as the most vulnerable periods for BC since the mammary gland undergoes the main anatomical and physiological transformations at those intervals. This means that during specific WOS, the EDC from the environment can have the most dangerous impact on BC risk and possible BC development later in a woman’s life. However, most clinical BC studies related to toxic environmental exposures have not been connected to the specific WOS. Therefore, the goal of this article is to briefly describe some important research results, focused on the links between EDC and BC, within four critical WOS. In addition, this mini-review outlines some useful biomarkers for further research and prophylaxis of BC and also for both the research community and the medical professionals. Conclusion: To bridge the gap in BC prevention, it is essential to recognize the links between EDC and BC within the critical WOS. Moreover, an integrative model of BC research, applying intermediate biomarkers, is necessary to determine the mechanisms of action of various EDC during critical periods in a woman’s lifespan. Hopefully, this will lead to progress in BC prevention. © 2021 Katarzyna Rygiel.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; biological marker; cadmium; dimethylbenz[a]anthracene; endocrine disruptor; enterolactone; estradiol; low density lipoprotein; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; phytoestrogen; triclosan; adult; angiogenesis; bioaccumulation; body mass; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer prevention; cancer research; cancer risk; cell proliferation; climacterium; dietary intake; digital breast tomosynthesis; echography; endocrine system; energy expenditure; environmental exposure; environmental factor; ethnicity; female; food contamination; genetic resistance; hormone substitution; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; lactation; life cycle; lifespan; male; mammary gland; mammography; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; oocyte development; oocyte maturation; postnatal development; pregnancy; prenatal period; prevalence; prophylaxis; puberty; Review; risk factor; signal transduction; tumor invasion; tumor microenvironment"

By opposition to structural elucidations benefitting from full data aspects, pharmacological evaluations are concerned with partial investigations resulting in sparse information. METHODS: The limited data availability was overcome by extensive consideration of several small sets of pharmacologically evaluated flavonoids in several plant taxa, alternatively to the traditional intensive analysis of big dataset of a given metabolic family in a given plant taxon. Statistical analyses were carried out using correspondence analysis, cluster analysis, box plots and fisher exact test to highlight structure-structure, structure-plant and structure-activity trends. RESULTS: Different aglycone types showed opposite trends between hydroxylation (flavonols, anthocyanidins, flavanols), and methoxylation (isoflavones, isoflavanes, neoflavones). Moreover, different carbons showed differential substitution levels in different aglycones: C3 in flavonols, C6, C8 in flavones, flavonols, C2' in flavanones, C6' in isoflavanes. Plant families were well differentiated by different relative occurrences of aglycones: flavones in Lamiaceae, flavanones in Rutaceae, neoflavones in Rubiaceae, flavonols in Asteraceae, isoflavones in Fabaceae. Relatively more hydroxylated flavonoids occurred in Asteraceae, Lamiaceae and Fabaceae vs. more methoxylated ones in Rutaceae and Rubiaceae. Concerning structure-activity trends, flavanols and isoflavones were relatively more concerned with anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory activities, respectively, vs. balanced distribution of flavones. Anti-inflammatory activity showed significant association with substitution position of same chemical groups (OH, OCH3), whereas anti-diabetic activity was revealed to be mainly influenced by the type of chemical groups (positive effect of OH and glycosyls). CONCLUSION: These results call for regular updates and further investigations.

In addition, previous dose-response assessments have focused primarily on evidence from animal studies. This critical review summarizes peer reviewed epidemiological studies on PFOA and cancers of the kidneys and testes, using modified Hill’s criteria to assess the evidence for causation. We converted exposures to a common scale based on serum PFOA concentrations and applied meta-analysis to estimate the average increase in cancer risk reported by the studies with sufficient information to estimate serum PFOA. Using random effects meta-analysis, we found that the average relative increase in cancer risk per 10 ng/mL increase in serum PFOA for these studies is 16% (95% CI: 3%, 30%) for kidney cancer and 3% (95% CI: 2%, 4%) for testicular cancer. These associations are most likely causal, but results are limited by the small number of studies for testicular cancer, the overlapping study populations for several studies, and the lack of measured or modeled serum PFOA concentrations for several studies. Implications: Our review meta-analysis indicates an average increase in cancer risk per 10 ng/mL increase in serum PFOA for kidney and testicular cancers. These associations are most likely causal, but results are limited by the small number of studies for testicular cancer, the overlapping study populations for several studies, and the lack of measured or modeled serum PFOA concentrations for several studies. The weight of evidence could be even stronger with the addition of future studies conducted in large cohorts. © 2021 A&WMA.","Random processes; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Animal studies; Critical review; Dose-response assessments; Epidemiological studies; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Random effects; Regulatory agencies; Weight of evidences; Diseases; biological product; perfluorooctanoic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; biological monitoring; cancer risk; carcinogenicity; dose response; human; kidney cancer; male; meta analysis (topic); nonhuman; peer review; priority journal; Review; study design; testis cancer; animal; kidney tumor; meta analysis; testis tumor; Animals; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Testicular Neoplasms"

Rodent studies show reverse effects, i.e. decreased blood cholesterol and triglycerides, occurring however at PFAS serum levels at least 100-fold higher than those in humans. This paper aims to present the main issues regarding the modulation of lipid homeostasis by the two most common PFASs, PFOS and PFOA, with emphasis on the underlying mechanisms relevant for humans. Overall, the apparent contrast between human and animal data may be an artifact of dose, with different molecular pathways coming into play upon exposure to PFASs at very low versus high levels. Altogether, the interpretation of existing rodent data on PFOS/PFOA-induced lipid perturbations with respect to the human situation is complex. From a mechanistic perspective, research on human liver cells shows that PFOS/PFOA activate the PPARα pathway, whereas studies on the involvement of other nuclear receptors, like PXR, are less conclusive. Other data indicate that suppression of the nuclear receptor HNF4α signaling pathway, as well as perturbations of bile acid metabolism and transport might be important cellular events that require further investigation. Future studies with human-relevant test systems would help to obtain more insight into the mechanistic pathways pertinent for humans. These studies shall be designed with a careful consideration of appropriate dosing and toxicokinetics, so as to enable biologically plausible quantitative extrapolations. Such research will increase the understanding of possible perturbed lipid homeostasis related to PFOS/ PFOA exposure and the potential implications for human health. © 2021 The Author(s).

In the present study, the dithiothreitol-based analytical methods of measuring the oxidative potential of particulate matter were appraised for factors that affect the experimental results, such as the sampling substrate, extraction solution, and dithiothreitol reaction. This study reveals the limitations of each experimental approach, which stem from hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, according to simulated lung fluid reactions.

Many studies around the world have reported the presence about these compounds in different aquatic ecosystems, raising concerns about the potential negative effects that occur on water, human health, and wildlife. In this context, this article aims to present a review on a global level of the most relevant aspects for the presence of PPs in water, since 2010 to 2019. The increased number of studies report the presence at emerging contaminants including PPs of different types in surface water, groundwater, wastewater and drinking water. The main sources of PPs entry into aquatic systems are due to discharges of wastewater that collect domestic water, hospital effluents and effluents from untreated or inadequately treated factories before being released into rivers and seas. The presence of PPs in the aquatic environment concerns about their persistence, bioaccumulation, toxicity and the generation of antibiotic resistance from many microorganisms, among other consequences not yet studied in the environment. © the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.

Organ metabolism depends on oxygen to produce adenosine triphosphate and temperatures below 37◦C reduce the metabolic rate and oxygen requirements. The transport and delivery of oxygen in machine perfusion are key determinants in preserving organ viability and cellular function. Oxygen delivery is more challenging than carbon dioxide removal, and oxygenation of the perfusion fluid is temperature dependent. The maximal oxygen content of water-based solutions is inversely related to the temperature, while cellular oxygen demand correlates positively with temperature. Machine perfusion above 20◦C will therefore require an oxygen carrier to enable sufficient oxygen delivery to the liver. Human red blood cells are the most physiological oxygen carriers. Alternative artificial oxygen transporters are hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers, perfluorocarbons, and an extracellular oxygen carrier derived from a marine invertebrate. We describe the principles of oxygen transport, delivery, and consumption in machine perfusion for donor livers using different oxygen carrier-based perfusion solutions and we discuss the properties, advantages, and disadvantages of these carriers and their use. © 2020 by the authors.

We aim to provide an overview of available effect biomarkers for monitoring chemical exposures in the general and occupational populations, and highlight their potential in monitoring humans exposed to chemical mixtures. We also discuss the role of the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework and physiologically based kinetic and dynamic (PBK/D) modelling to strengthen the understanding of the biological mechanism of effect biomarkers, and in particular for use in regulatory risk assessments. An interdisciplinary network of experts from the European chapter of the International Society for Exposure Science (ISES Europe) and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Occupational Biomonitoring activity of Working Parties of Hazard and Exposure Assessment group worked together to map the conventional framework of biomarkers and provided recommendations for their systematic use. We summarized the key aspects of this work here, and discussed these in three parts. Part I, we inventory available effect biomarkers and promising new biomarkers for the general population based on the H2020 Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) initiative. Part II, we provide an overview AOP and PBK/D modelling use that improved the selection and interpretation of effect biomarkers. Part III, we describe the collected expertise from the OECD Occupational Biomonitoring subtask effect biomarkers in prioritizing relevant mode of actions (MoAs) and suitable effect biomarkers. Furthermore, we propose a tiered risk assessment approach for occupational biomonitoring. Several effect biomarkers, especially for use in occupational settings, are validated. They offer a direct assessment of the overall health risks associated with exposure to chemicals, chemical mixtures and their transformation products. Promising novel effect biomarkers are emerging for biomonitoring of the general population. Efforts are being dedicated to prioritizing molecular and biochemical effect biomarkers that can provide a causal link in exposure-health outcome associations. This mechanistic approach has great potential in improving human health risk assessment. New techniques such as in silico methods (e.g. QSAR, PBK/D modelling) as well as ‘omics data will aid this process. Our multidisciplinary review represents a starting point for enhancing the identification of effect biomarkers and their mechanistic pathways following the AOP framework. This may help in prioritizing the effect biomarker implementation as well as defining threshold limits for chemical mixtures in a more structured way. Several ex vivo biomarkers have been proposed to evaluate combined effects including genotoxicity and xeno-estrogenicity. There is a regulatory need to derive effect-based trigger values using the increasing mechanistic knowledge coming from the AOP framework to address adverse health effects due to exposure to chemical mixtures. Such a mechanistic strategy would reduce the fragmentation observed in different regulations. It could also stimulate a harmonized use of effect biomarkers in a more comparable way, in particular for risk assessments to chemical mixtures. © 2020 The Author(s)","Biohazards; Health; Health risks; Indicators (chemical); International cooperation; Mixtures; Risk assessment; Adverse health effects; Biological mechanisms; Environmental chemicals; Human health risk assessment; International society; Organization for economic co-operation and development; Tiered risk assessment; Transformation products; Biomarkers; acrylamide; arsenic; bisphenol; cadmium; chemical compound; chromium; flame retardant; lead; mercury; mycotoxin; organophosphate; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pesticide; phthalic acid; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; unclassified drug; biological marker; biomarker; biomonitoring; health risk; occupational exposure; OECD; physiological response; pollution exposure; public health; risk assessment; adverse outcome pathway; age; allergy; anxiety disorder; asthma; atherosclerosis; attention deficit disorder; autoimmune disease; biological monitoring; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; cerebrovascular accident; degenerative disease; depression; developmental toxicity; disease predisposition; fatty liver; fertility; genital system disease; glomerulonephritis; human; immunopathology; immunotoxicity; intelligence quotient; ischemic heart disease; kidney tubule disorder; liver injury; lung toxicity; male infertility; malignant neoplasm; metabolic disorder; metabolic syndrome X; model; mutagenicity; neurotoxicity; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; physiological stress; physiologically based kinetic and dynamic modelling; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; puberty; reproductive toxicity; Review; risk assessment; teratogenesis; working memory; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; Europe; Biological Monitoring; Biomarkers; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Humans; Risk Assessment"

Here, we review reported internal exposure levels of various HOPs (organochlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, short- and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) in placenta, and both maternal and umbilical cord sera. We also present analyses of the transplacental transfer and placental distribution characteristics of each class of compounds, and discuss effects of several factors on the transfer and accumulation efficiencies of HOPs, as well as the main mechanisms of HOPs’ transfer across the placental barrier. Reported compound-specific transplacental transfer efficiencies and distribution efficiencies, expressed as umbilical cord:maternal serum and placental:maternal serum concentration ratios (RCM and RPM, respectively), are summarized. Average published RCM values of the HOPs range from 0.24 to 3.08 (lipid-adjusted) and from 0.04 to 3.1 (based on wet weights), and are highest for perfluoroalkylcarboxylates (PFCAs) and tetrabromobisphenol A. Average published RPM values range from 0.14 to 1.02 (lipid-adjusted) and from 0.30 to 1.4 (based on wet weights). The broad RCM and RPM ranges may reflect effects of various factors, inter alia physicochemical properties of HOPs, metabolic capacities of mothers and fetuses, placental maturity, and differential expression of influx/efflux transporters in the placenta. Generally, HOPs’ RCM values decline linearly with molecular size, and are curvilinearly related to solubility. Plasma protein binding affinity and the difference between maternal and fetal metabolic capacities may also affect some HOPs’ transfer efficiencies. HOPs’ molecular size may be influential. Transplacental transport of HOPs likely occurs mostly through passive diffusion, although influx/efflux transporters expressed on maternal and/or fetal sides of the placenta may also facilitate or hinder their transport. Overall, the review highlights clear gaps in our understanding of mechanisms involved in HOPs’ transplacental transport. © 2020 The Author(s)","Binding energy; Biochemistry; Efficiency; Halogenation; Metabolism; Organic chemicals; Physicochemical properties; Distribution characteristics; Distribution efficiency; Medium-chain chlorinated paraffins; Organochlorinated pesticides; Plasma protein binding; Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Transfer characteristics; Transplacental transfers; Organic pollutants; organochlorine pesticide; paraffin; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkylcarboxylate; plasma protein; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; tetrabromobisphenol A; unclassified drug; diphenyl ether derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; halogen; health impact; metabolism; persistent organic pollutant; physicochemical property; plasma; pollution exposure; serum; solubility; active transport; anthropometric parameters; binding affinity; bioaccumulation; halogenated organic pollutant; human; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; isomer; maternal blood; metabolic capacity; molecular size; passive transport; persistent organic pollutant; physical chemistry; placenta; placental transfer; pollution transport; prenatal exposure; priority journal; protein expression; Review; risk factor; solubility; systematic review; transport kinetics; umbilical cord blood; chemistry; female; fetomaternal transfusion; pollutant; pregnancy; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Persistent Organic Pollutants; Placenta; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Pregnancy"

This review summarizes the available data regarding the toxic effects of OUVFs on marine and freshwater organisms and generates the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) values necessary for assessing ecological risk. Through a systematic search of the literature, 89 studies were identified and ecotoxicological data extracted. Collectively, these studies described toxicity testing with 39 OUVF from 10 structural classes, with derivatives of benzophenones (49%) and camphors (16%) most studied. There was a bias towards selecting freshwater species (61%), and evaluating single OUVF effects (87%) rather than OUVF mixtures. Short-term (acute) experimentation (58%) was marginally more common than long-term (chronic) testing (42%). Reproductive, developmental, genetic, and neurological toxicity were the most commonly identified effects in aquatic organism, and were associated with molecular interactions with steroid receptors, DNA, or the production of reactive oxygen species. Species sensitivity distribution and/or assessment factors were used to calculate PNECs for 22 OUVFs and the risk quotients for 12 OUVFs. When using maximum concentrations, high risk was observed for six OUVFs in marine environments (4-methylbenzylidene-camphor, octocrylene, padimate-O, benzophenone-1, and oxybenzone, ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate), and for four OUVFs in freshwater environments (ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, avobenzone and oxybenzone).

Since the discovery of the autoantigen phospholipase A2 receptor in primary membranous nephropathy 10 years ago, the serologic evaluation of glomerular diseases has become more detailed and nuanced for nephrologists. In addition to phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies, circulating autoantibodies now include thrombospondin type 1 domain–containing 7A and most recently, neural epidermal growth factor–like 1 protein for membranous nephropathy. Additionally, discoveries in C3 glomerulopathy and fibrillary glomerulonephritis are poised to improve the diagnostic approach to these disorders by using novel biomarkers to complement traditional histologic patterns on kidney biopsy. Although kidney biopsies are considered the gold standard in profiling glomerular diseases, validated novel glomerular biomarkers contribute substantially to the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches through their ability to improve sensitivity, permit dynamic longitudinal monitoring of disease activity, and capture genetic heterogeneity.

In recent years, our understanding of PFASs as contaminants in vegetation has increased considerably. PFASs are taken up, transformed and accumulated in various compartments of plants, and the rate of these processes depends on environmental conditions, compound-specific characteristics, plant species, and other competing factors. This review summarizes the recent findings on the uptake, accumulation, distribution and metabolism of PFASs in higher plants, with a specific focus on plant metabolism pathways of representative polyfluoroalkyl compounds. The potential risk of PFASs in plant-origin food for human exposure is also discussed. Further studies on plant metabolism of polyfluoroalkyl chemicals are in urgent need to fill the data gaps and allow a comprehensive understanding of plant metabolism pathways.

The challenges for each pathway to produce “drop-in” fuels are covered. Currently “drop-in” fuel production cost is approximately 2 times (~5–6$/gallon) higher than fossil fuels (3$/gallon), especially with the use of 2nd generation feedstocks. The primary sources of cost with “drop-in” fuel production are feedstock cost (40–60% of the total production cost), syngas cleaning and conditioning to meet Fischer-Tropsch synthesis requirement (12–15% of the total production cost) and bio oil upgrading (14–18% of the total production cost) in the case of pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The most influential factors on the life cycle analysis (LCA) were biomass cultivation, harvesting, biomass pre-treatment, and transportation. Therefore, robust processes that can use local waste biomass are far more environmental and economically viable, especially as biofuel from second generation have a greater potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (50–100%) than first generation biofuels (50–90%) when land use changes are omitted in the LCA. The sustainability of biofuels is pre-dominantly dependant on the sustainability of the initial biomass, with 2nd generation feedstocks being more sustainable than 1st generation. Gasification-FTS is considered as the most promising technique for “drop-in” fuel production over pyrolysis and HTL due to its flexibility towards feedstock acceptance and the ability to produced high yields of liquid fuel together with other economically viable biofuels such as electricity and heat. Biochemical routes (i.e.fermentation) to “drop-in” fuels are still in their early development stages, and therefore require more studies and pilot-scale experiments in order to discover an economic and sustainable means of using these methods. © 2020","Bioconversion; Biofuels; Biomass; Costs; Economic analysis; Feedstocks; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Life cycle; Pyrolysis; Sustainable development; Conversion technology; Critical review; Economically viable; Fuel production; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Life cycle analysis; Life cycle assessment; Techno-Economic analysis; Total production cost; “drop-in” fuel; Drops"

This study reviews the issues concerning PFASs exposure and potential risks generated with a focus on PFAS occurrence and transformation in various media, discusses their physicochemical characterization and treatment technologies, before discussing the potential human exposure routes. The various toxicological impacts to human health are also discussed. The article pays particular attention to the complexity and challenging issue of regulating PFAS compounds due to the arising uncertainty and lack of epidemiological evidence encountered. The variation in PFAS regulatory values across the globe can be easily addressed due to the influence of multiple scientific, technical, and social factors. The varied toxicology and the insufficient definition of PFAS exposure rate are among the main factors contributing to this discrepancy. The lack of proven standard approaches for examining PFAS in surface water, groundwater, wastewater, or solids adds more technical complexity. Although it is agreed that PFASs pose potential health risks in various media, the link between the extent of PFAS exposure and the significance of PFAS risk remain among the evolving research areas. There is a growing need to address the correlation between the frequency and the likelihood of human exposure to PFAS and the possible health risks encountered. Although USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) recommends the 70 ng/L lifetime health advisory in drinking water for both perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFO) perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which is similar to the Australian regulations, the German Ministry of Health proposed a health-based guidance of maximum of 300 ng/L for the combination of PFOA and PFOS. Moreover, there are significant discrepancies among the US states where the water guideline levels for the different states ranged from 13 to 1000 ng L−1 for PFOA and/or PFOS. The current review highlighted the significance of the future research required to fill in the knowledge gap in PFAS toxicology and to better understand this through real field data and long-term monitoring programs. © 2020 by the authors.

The largest flux of F at the Earth's surface derives from the mobilization of F during chemical (2.2 Tg F/yr (where 1 Tg = 1012 g) and mechanical (7 Tg F/yr) weathering of rocks. Humans supplement these fluxes by mining fluorospar and apatite ores to make a variety of industrial chemicals and fertilizers, mobilizing 2.9 and 7.6 Tg F/yr, respectively. Other large anthropogenic fluxes derive from the manufacture of bricks (1.8 Tg F/yr) and extraction of groundwater (0.9 to 1.7 Tg F/yr). Rivers deliver ~3.6 Tg/yr of dissolved fluoride to the oceans, where the mean residence time of dissolved F in seawater is ~500,000 yr. F is removed from the oceans by the deposition of terrigenous (4.3 Tg F/yr) and authigenic sediments (1.24 Tg F/yr), and approximately 10 Tg F/yr is removed from the surface of the Earth by subduction of the oceanic lithosphere. Humans have increased the flux of F to the atmosphere and in rivers by more than a factor of 2, with the largest impacts stemming from the use of phosphorus fertilizers, the production of brick, and extraction of groundwater. Despite their well-documented toxicity, perfluoroalkyl substances make only a small contribution to F emitted to the atmosphere and natural waters. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

Despite this high diversity, all PFAS are alike in that they contain perfluoroalkyl moieties that are extremely resistant to environmental and metabolic degradation. The vast majority of PFAS are therefore either non-degradable or transform ultimately into stable terminal transformation products (which are still PFAS). Under the European chemicals regulation this classifies PFAS as very persistent substances (vP). We argue that this high persistence is sufficient concern for their management as a chemical class, and for all ""non-essential""uses of PFAS to be phased out. The continual release of highly persistent PFAS will result in increasing concentrations and increasing probabilities of the occurrence of known and unknown effects. Once adverse effects are identified, the exposure and associated effects will not be easily reversible. Reversing PFAS contamination will be technically challenging, energy intensive, and costly for society, as is evident in the efforts to remove PFAS from contaminated land and drinking water sources.

Comprised mostly of methane and carbon dioxide, it can be used as fuel in cogeneration systems, automotive mobility and domestic heating, among other applications. The increasing interest in the use of biogas has raised some questions regarding its quality for energy valorization. To start, the carbon dioxide content must be adjusted to upgrade the calorific power and economic value and then common potentially hazardous and even toxic impurities such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfur, halogens, or ammonia should be removed to ensure a correct operation. Recently, a close attention was drawn to the presence of siloxanes.

However, AR ramifications in developing countries are worsened by limited molecular diagnostics, expensive therapeutics, inadequate numbers of skilled clinicians and scientists, and unsanitary environments. The epidemiology of Gram-negative bacteria, their AR genes, and geographical distribution in Africa are described here. Data were extracted and analyzed from English-language articles published between 2015 and December 2019. The genomes and AR genes of the various species, obtained from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) and NCBI were analyzed phylogenetically using Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood (RAxML) and annotated with Figtree. The geographic location of resistant clones/clades was mapped manually. Thirty species from 31 countries and 24 genera from 41 countries were analyzed from 146 articles and 3,028 genomes, respectively.

Clonal and multiclonal outbreaks and dissemination of resistance genes across species and countries and between humans, animals, plants, and the environment were observed; Escherichia coli ST103, K. pneumoniae ST101, S. enterica ST1/2, and Vibrio cholerae ST69/515 were common strains. Most pathogens were of human origin, and zoonotic transmissions were relatively limited. IMPORTANCE Antibiotic resistance (AR) is one of the major public health threats and challenges to effective containment and treatment of infectious bacterial diseases worldwide. Here, we used different methods to map out the geographical hot spots, sources, and evolutionary epidemiology of AR. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., Neisseria meningitis/gonorrhoeae, Vibrio cholerae, Campylobacter jejuni, etc., were common pathogens shuttling AR genes in Africa. Transmission of the same clones/strains across countries and between animals, humans, plants, and the environment was observed.

Despite their unprecedented combination of desirable attributes, PTFE and copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) with hexafluoropropylene and perfluoropropylvinylether are crystalline and exhibit poor solubility in solvents, which makes their processability very challenging.

Several treatment methods such as physical, biological and chemical processes have been explored to deal with these compounds. Current trends have shown that the destructive treatment processes, which offer degradation and mineralization of PFASs, are the most desirable process among researchers and policy makers. This article, therefore, reviews the degradation and defluorination processes, their efficiencies and the degradation mechanism of photon-based processes. It shows that high degradation and defluorination efficiency of PFASs could be achieved by photon driven processes such as photolysis, photochemical, photocatalysis and photoreduction. The efficiency of these processes is greatly influenced by the nature of light and the reactive radical generated in the system. The limitation of these processes, however, include the long reaction time required and the use of anoxic reaction conditions, which are not obtainable at ambient conditions. © 2020 The Author(s)",

In this context, the signalling hub protein RACK1 (Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1) could represent a nexus between cancer and the immune system due to its roles in cancer progression and innate immune activation. Since RACK1 is a relevant EDCs target that responds to steroid-active compounds, it could be considered a molecular bridge between the endocrine-regulated tumour microenvironment and the innate immune system. We provide an analysis of immunomodulatory and cancer-promoting effects of different EDCs in shaping tumour microenvironment, with a final focus on the scaffold protein RACK1 as a pivotal molecular player due to its dual role in immune and cancer contexts. © 2020 by the authors.

Numerous PFASs with varied applications and physicochemical properties are in use, which makes the integrated PFAS analysis challenging. Great advancements in sample pretreatment and instrumental analysis for PFASs have been made since the 2000s, allowing faster and broader PFAS determination.

RECENT FINDINGS: Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances appear to reduce breastfeeding duration through impaired mammary gland development, lactogenesis, and suppressed endocrine signaling. Halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons have differing associations with lactation duration, likely because of the variety of signaling pathways that they affect, pointing to the importance of complex mixtures in epidemiologic studies. Although epidemiologic literature suggests that pesticides and fungicides decrease or have no effect on lactation duration, toxicology literature suggests enhanced mammary gland development through estrogenic and/or antiandrogenic pathways. Toxicological studies suggest that phthalates may affect mammary gland development via estrogenic pathways but no association with lactation duration has been observed. Bisphenol A was associated with decreased duration of breastfeeding, likely through direct and indirect action on estrogenic pathways. SUMMARY: EDCs play a role in mammary gland development, function, and lactogenesis, which can affect breastfeeding duration. Further research should explore direct mechanisms of EDCs on lactation, the significance of toxicant mixtures, and transgenerational effects of EDCs on lactation.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzhydryl derivative; endocrine disruptor; pesticide; phenol derivative; phthalic acid; phthalic acid derivative; adverse event; animal; breast; breast feeding; drug effect; environmental exposure; female; growth, development and aging; human; lactation; physiology; time factor; udder; Animals; Benzhydryl Compounds; Breast; Breast Feeding; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Lactation; Mammary Glands, Animal; Pesticides; Phenols; Phthalic Acids; Time Factors"

The shortage of new antimicrobial agents has led to the re-evaluation of old antibiotics such as fosfomycin as a potential regimen for treating multidrug-resistant bacteria especially extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Fosfomycin is a broad-spectrum bactericidal antibiotic that inhibits the initial step of the cell wall biosynthesis. Fosfomycin resistance can occur due to mutation in the drug uptake system or by the acquisition of fosfomycin-modifying enzymes. In this review, we focus on mobile fosfomycin-resistant genes encoding glutathione-S-transferase which are mainly responsible for fosfomycin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, that is, fosA and its subtypes, fosC2, and the recently described fosL1-L2. We summarized the proposed origins of the different resistance determinants and highlighted the different plasmid types which are attributed to the dissemination of fosfomycin-modifying enzymes. Thereby, IncF and IncN plasmids play a predominant role. The detection of mobile fosfomycin-resistant genes in Enterobacteriaceae has increased in recent years. Similar to the situation in (East) Asia, the most frequently detected fosfomycin-resistant gene in Europe is fosA3. Mobile fosfomycin-resistant genes have been detected in isolates of human, animal, food, and environmental origin which leads to a growing concern regarding the risk of spread of such bacteria, especially Escherichia coli and Salmonella, at the human–animal–environment interface. © 2020 The Authors.

PFAAs are hormone-disrupting compounds that are strongly suspected to affect mother-child-health such as fetal growth. Thyroid disruption is a plausible mechanism of action. We aim to summarize the epidemiological evidence for the relation between prenatal and postnatal exposure to PFAAs and disruption of thyroid homeostasis in mothers and/or infants. Method: Fifteen original publications on PFAAs concentrations and thyroid hormones (TH) in pregnant women and/or infants were found upon a literature search in the PubMed database. Information on exposure to seven PFAAs congeners [Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), Perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), Perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA), and Perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA)] and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free and total thyroxine (FT4 and TT4), free and total triiodothyronine (FT3 and TT3), T3RU (Free triiodothyronine resin uptake) and FT4-index (FT4I) levels were recorded. We evaluated sampling of maternal TH by trimester, and infant TH by sex stratification. Reported associations between mother or infant PFAAs and TH were not uniformly assessed in the selected studies. Results: Ten out of the fifteen studies examined maternal PFAAs concentration and TSH level. Seven studies showed significant associations between TSH and exposure to six PFAAs congeners, most of them were positive. Maternal T4 and T3 were investigated in nine studies and five studies found inverse associations between exposure to six PFAAs congeners and TH (TT3, TT4, FT3, FT4 and FT4I) levels. Eight of the fifteen studies investigated PFAAs concentrations and infant TSH. Infant TSH level was significantly affected in four studies, positively in three studies. Nine studies investigated infant T4 and T3 and seven studies found significant associations with PFAAs exposure. However, both inverse and positive significant associations with infant TH were found eliciting no clear direction. Conclusion: Results indicate a mainly positive relationship between maternal PFAAs concentrations and TSH levels, and suggestion of an inverse association with T4 and/or T3 levels. Associations of infant TH with PFAAs concentration were less consistent. © 2020, The Author(s).","fluorine derivative; liothyronine; perflouroalkyl acid; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorododecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; thyroid hormone; thyrotropin; thyroxine; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; carboxylic acid; decanoic acid derivative; fluorocarbon; thyroid hormone; chemical compound; concentration (composition); detection method; epidemiology; homeostasis; hormone; literature review; resin; clinical outcome; concentration (parameter); controlled study; female; fetus; homeostasis; hormone determination; human; hypothyroidism; maternal exposure; pregnant woman; prenatal exposure; priority journal; Review; thyroid gland; blood; environmental exposure; fetomaternal transfusion; mother; pollutant; pregnancy; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Carboxylic Acids; Decanoic Acids; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fetus; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Mothers; Pregnancy; Thyroid Hormones"

The release of PFAS from e-waste processing sites and storage landfills into wastewaters was reviewed. It appears that e-waste materials in landfills serve as important nodes for PFAS diffusion to water, soil, hence exerting ecotoxicity on exposed human populations.

More recently, the direct-one-pot incorporation of these groups (i.e.: RFS- and RFSe-) has allowed for the late-stage functionalization of biological relevant substrates, which permits achieving synthetic protocols in the presence of other sensitive functional groups.

The Panel determined in 2012 there was a ‘probable link’ (i.e., more probable than not based on the weight of the available scientific evidence) between PFOA and high cholesterol, thyroid disease, kidney and testicular cancer, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. Objective: Here, former C8 Science Panel members and collaborators comment on the PFOA literature regarding thyroid disorders, cancer, immune and auto-immune disorders, liver disease, hypercholesterolemia, reproductive outcomes, neurotoxicity, and kidney disease. We also discuss developments regarding fate and transport, and pharmacokinetic models, and discuss causality assessment in cross-sectional associations among low-exposed populations. Discussion: For cancer, the epidemiologic evidence remains supportive but not definitive for kidney and testicular cancers. There is consistent evidence of a positive association between PFOA and cholesterol, but no evidence of an association with heart disease. There is evidence for an association with ulcerative colitis, but not for other auto-immune diseases. There is good evidence that PFOA is associated with immune response, but uneven evidence for an association with infectious disease. The evidence for an association between PFOA and thyroid and kidney disease is suggestive but uneven. There is evidence of an association with liver enzymes, but not with liver disease. There is little evidence of an association with neurotoxicity. Suggested reductions in birthweight may be due to reverse causality and/or confounding. Fate and transport models and pharmacokinetic models remain central to estimating past exposure for new cohorts, but are difficult to develop without good historical data on emissions of PFOA into the environment. Conclusion: Overall, the epidemiologic evidence remains limited. For a few outcomes there has been some replication of our earlier findings. More longitudinal research is needed in large populations with large exposure contrasts. Additional cross-sectional studies of low exposed populations may be less informative. © 2020","Cholesterol; Pharmacokinetics; Cross-sectional study; Fate and transport; Hypercholesterolemia; Longitudinal research; Pharmacokinetic model; Pregnancy-induced hypertensions; Scientific evidence; Ulcerative colitis; Diseases; cholesterol; liver enzyme; octanoic acid derivative; perfluoroctanoate; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; environmental fate; enzyme; health impact; immune response; infectious disease; pollutant transport; public health; autoimmune disease; birth weight; cancer risk; environmental exposure; environmental health; genital system disease; health hazard; human; hypercholesterolemia; immune response; immunotoxicity; kidney cancer; liver disease; maternal hypertension; neurotoxicity; Ohio; population research; population size; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; testis cancer; thyroid disease; toxicokinetics; ulcerative colitis; cross-sectional study; female; male; pregnancy; testis tumor; Caprylates; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Male; Ohio; Pregnancy; Testicular Neoplasms"

It has been manufactured from past 40 years but its presence in the environment was initially reported in 2006. Later, it has been found in various biotic and abiotic environmental matrices. However, little attention has been paid to monitor its presence in Asia. Many studies have reported the occurrence of DP in the environment of Asia, yet the data are scarce, and studies are limited to few regions. The objective of present review is to summarize the occurrence, distribution, and toxicity of this ubiquitous pollutant in various environmental matrices (biotic and abiotic). DP has also been reported in the areas with no emission sources, which proves its long-range transport. Moreover, urbanization and industrialization also affect the distribution of DP, i.e., high levels of DP have been found in urban areas relative to the rural. Tidal movement also incorporates in transport of DP across the aquatic system. Further, bioaccumulation trend of DP in various tissues is kidney > liver > muscle tissues, whereas, blood brain barrier resists its accumulation in brain tissues. Additionally, gender-based accumulation trends revealed high DP levels in females in comparison to males due to strong metabolism of males. Furthermore, methodological aspects and instrumental analysis used in previous studies have also been summarized here. However, data on biomagnification in aquatic ecosystem and bioaccumulation of DP in terrestrial food web are still scarce. Toxicity behavior of syn-DP and anti-DP is still unknown which might gain the interest for future studies. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","bioaccumulation; blood; brain; environmental quality; flame retardant; food web; industrialization; long range transport; metabolism; toxicity; Asia; chlorinated hydrocarbon; dechlorane plus; flame retardant; polycyclic hydrocarbon; Asia; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; female; pollutant; Asia; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Flame Retardants; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Polycyclic Compounds"

The first section of this overview examines in detail recent techno-economic analyses on the utilization of biomass as a source of syngas for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS). FTS is a highly localized industry, and depends on the sources of syngas available, the products desired, and the demand for co- production of electricity. Where coal or natural gas coexist in the region where biomass is available, economics may favor producing or blending syngas from multiple resources, making biomass-to-liquids a highly complex scenario. Land use management is essential for sustainable biomass production, if used as the carbon source for FTS. The second section discusses FTS mechanisms, reactions and catalysts. Supposing the catalyst surface energy favors CO hydrogenation to FTS products, the sweet spot of FTS, selectivity will depend on the degree of back- donation from the metal. The degree of electron back-donation from the catalyst surface to both adsorbed CO and vinylic intermediates in part controls the FT synthesis product distribution. When the back-donation is sufficient, chain growth favors longer chained linear hydrocarbons (paraffins, alpha olefins, linear alcohols) suitable for upgrading to diesel, jet fuels, lubricants, and waxes. When back-donation is less significant, monomethyl branched hydrocarbons, internal olefins, and oxygenates (esters, acids and ketones) are elevated. Lastly, active supports are discussed for increasing the termination rate to oxygenates and olefins, as are hybrid catalysts that simultaneously carry out FTS and upgrading, often through secondary reactions. The last section provides an overview of the commercial scale reactor designs including the fixed bed, fluidized bed, and slurry bubble column reactor currently used in the FTS process. Economically, FTS is favored at larger scales; however, new compact reactor designs are coming into play aimed at monetizing highly localized (e.g. biomass) and stranded resources (e.g. natural gas). These types of reactors, involving microchannel and heat exchanger designs, must be highly efficient at managing heat, cost-effective, and mobile in order to exploit non-traditional sources of syngas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; Blending; Bubble columns; Catalyst selectivity; Coal deposits; Cost effectiveness; Economic analysis; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Ketones; Land use; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Olefins; Synthesis gas; Synthesis gas manufacture; Biomass productions; Branched hydrocarbons; Heat exchanger design; Land-use management; Product distributions; Secondary reactions; Slurry bubble column reactors; Techno-Economic analysis; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis"

As a typical perfluorinated compound widely distributed, PFOS contaminates many daily foods in various ways, such as food contamination through fast food packaging/wrappers, beverage contamination through disposable cardboard cups, food contamination through nonstick frying pan coating, in particular, the contamination through food contact materials is the most neglected pathway. PFOS has a variety of toxic effects including acute toxicity, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cytotoxicity and reproductive toxicity. However, the content of PFOS in the contaminated food contact materials is often relatively low. Thus, rapid and accurate determination of PFOS is challenging. In this paper, the toxicity of PFOS, contamination levels of PFOS in various media, migration of PFOS to foods, and various methods for detecting PFOS in food contact materials were reviewed.

Environmental exposures can have lifelong consequences. In particular, exposures during the vulnerable fetal or early development period can affect structure, physiology and metabolism, causing potential adverse, often permanent, health effects at any point in life. External exposures, such as the “chemical exposome” (exposures to environmental chemicals), affect the host’s metabolism and immune system, which, in turn, mediate the risk of various diseases. Linking such exposures to adverse outcomes, via intermediate phenotypes such as the metabolome, is one of the central themes of exposome research. Much progress has been made in this line of research, including addressing some key challenges such as analytical coverage of the exposome and metabolome, as well as the integration of heterogeneous, multi-omics data. There is strong evidence that chemical exposures have a marked impact on the metabolome, associating with specific disease risks.

As the body of literature on their environmental effects has increased, so has regulatory and research scrutiny. The widespread usage of PFAS in industrial applications and consumer products, complicated by their environmental release, mobility, fate, and transport, have resulted in multiple exposure routes for humans. Furthermore, low screening levels and stringent regulatory standards that vary by state introduce considerable uncertainty and potential costs in the environmental management of PFAS. The recalcitrant nature of PFAS render their removal difficult, but existing and emerging technologies can be leveraged to destroy or sequester PFAS in a variety of environmental matrices. Additionally, new research on PFAS remediation technologies has emerged to address the efficiency, costs, and other shortcomings of existing remediation methods. Further research on the impact of field parameters such as secondary water quality effects, the presence of co-contaminants and emerging PFAS, reaction mechanisms, defluorination yields, and the decomposition products of treatment technologies is needed to fully evaluate these emerging technologies, and industry attention should focus on treatment train approaches to improve efficiency and reduce the cost of treatment. © 2020 by the authors.

The cellular antioxidant defense system is activated by PFAS, but it is only partially able to avoid the oxidative damage to biomolecules. © 2020 by the authors.

Elasmobranchs are particularly vulnerable to pollutant exposure which may pose a risk to the organism as well as humans that consume elasmobranch products. The highest concentrations of pollutants were found in sharks occupying top trophic levels (Carcharhiniformes and Lamniformes). A human health risk assessment identified that children and adults consuming shark once a week are exposed to over three times more mercury than is recommended by the US EPA. This poses a risk to local fishing communities and international consumers of shark-based products, as well as those subject to the widespread mislabelling of elasmobranch products.

Photocatalytic approaches have been widely studied for the effective removal of PFCs due to the mild operation conditions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date summary on the homogenous and heterogeneous photocatalytic processes for PFCs removal. Specifically, the homogenous photocatalytic methods for remediating PFCs are firstly discussed, including generation of hydrated electrons (eaq‒) and its performance and mechanisms for photo-reductive destruction of PFCs, the active species responsible for photo-oxidative degradation of PFCs and the corresponding mechanisms, and metal-ion-mediated (Fe(III) mainly used) processes for the remediation of PFCs. The influences of molecular structures of PFCs and water matrix, such as dissolved oxygen, humic acid, nitrate, chloride on the homogenous photocatalytic degradation of PFCs are also discussed. For heterogeneous photocatalytic processes, various semiconductor photocatalysts used for the decomposition of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are then discussed in terms of their specific properties benefiting photocatalytic performances. The preparation methods for optimizing the performance of photocatalysts are also overviewed. Moreover, the photo-oxidative and photo-reductive pathways are summarized for remediating PFOA in the presences of different semiconductor photocatalysts, including active species responsible for the degradation. We finally put forward several key perspectives for the photocatalytic removal of PFCs to promote its practical application in PFCs-containing wastewater treatment, including the treatment of PFCs degradation products such as fluoride ion, and the development of noble-metal free photocatalysts that could efficiently remove PFCs under solar light irradiation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biochemistry; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Chlorine compounds; Degradation; Dissolved oxygen; Fluorine compounds; Metal ions; Molecular oxygen; Photocatalytic activity; Precious metals; Remediation; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Mild operation conditions; Photo catalytic degradation; Photo-catalytic removal; Photo-oxidative degradation; Photocatalytic performance; Photochemical decompositions; Semiconductor photocatalyst; Toxicological properties; Iron compounds; chloride; dissolved oxygen; humic acid; nitrate; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanoic acid; water; ferric ion; bioaccumulation; chemical pollutant; decomposition analysis; photochemistry; photodegradation; water pollution; decomposition; defluorination; human; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; photocatalysis; photochemistry; photooxidation; priority journal; Review; waste component removal; water contamination; humic substance; waste water; water pollution; Ferric Compounds; Humic Substances; Waste Water; Water Pollution"

Furthermore, most endorectal coils create a susceptibility artifact detrimental to both anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) acquisitions. We aimed at assessing the safety and MRS performance of a susceptibility-matched endorectal coil for further rectal wall analysis. Experiments were performed on a General Electric MR750 3 T scanner. A variable number of miniaturized passive RF traps were incorporated in the reception cable. The assessment of RF heating and coil sensitivity was conducted on a 1.5% agar-agar phantom doped with NaCl. Several susceptibility-matched materials such as Ultem, perfluorocarbon and barium sulfate were then compared with an external coil. Finally, Ultem was used as a solid support for an endorectal coil and compared with a reference coil. Phantom experiments exhibited a complete suppression of both the RF heating phenomenon and the coil sensitivity artifact. Ultem was the material that produced the smallest image distortion. The full width at half maximum of MR spectra acquired using the susceptibility-matched endorectal coil showed at least 30% narrowing compared with a reference endorectal coil.

All relevant biological matrices used in the cited studies were included, such as maternal blood, umbilical cord blood, breast milk, placenta, amniotic fluid, fetal organs, newborns’ dried blood spots, and infant serum. We show that such exposures are geographically global with significant discrepancies among countries and continents, and that while the levels of major legacy PFASs (PFOS and PFOA) have declined since 2000, those of others may have not. We also show that levels of PFOS and PFOA exceed those of some major environmental toxins, such as p,p′-DDE, BDE-47, PCB-153, PBB-153, and OH-PBDEs in maternal blood. Given that the behavior and potential effects have an origin in molecular structure, biomonitoring and research at the levels of isomers and enantiomers are critically important.

Emerging pollutants typically occur in low concentrations and are not removed by conventional DWT processes. Emerging DBPs appear within the DWT or in the distribution system due to the combination of disinfection agents (especially chlorine) with precursors as: natural organic matter (NOM), algal organic matter (AOM), anthropogenic contaminants (pesticides, pharmaceuticals, detergents etc.), brominated and iodinated compounds. This study has as main goal a consistent analysis of the major problems caused by emerging DBPs to drinking water supplies. It presents a comprehensive review of the research efforts related to emerging DBPs considering three viewpoints: 1. an overview of their classification, legislative framework, methods of analysis, disinfection operational conditions and removal processes; 2. their occurrence, fate, health effects and impacts; 3. the analysis of the advanced DWT processes that might be used for the removal and control of precursors and DBPs, with a focus on pilot and full-scale installations. All presented case studies considered pollutants removed, process conditions and efficiencies, and a critical assessment of processes based on membranes, advanced oxidation and adsorption on activated carbon or other materials.

Hydrocarbon separations have traditionally relied predominantly on costly and energy-intensive heat-driven procedures such as low-temperature distillations. Adsorptive separation based on porous solids represents an alternative technology that is potentially more energy efficient for the separation of some hydrocarbons. Great efforts have been made recently not only in the development of adsorbents with optimal separation performance but also toward the subsequent implementation of adsorption-based separation technology. Emerging as a relatively new class of multifunctional porous materials, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) hold substantial promise as adsorbents for highly efficient separation of hydrocarbons. This is because of their exceptional and intrinsic porosity tunability, which enables size-exclusion-based separations that render the highest possible separation selectivity. In this review, recent advances in the development of MOFs for separation of selected groups of hydrocarbons are reviewed, including methane/C2 hydrocarbons, normal alkanes, alkane isomers, and alkane/alkene/alkyne and C8 alkylaromatics, with a particular focus on separations based on the size-exclusion mechanism.

However, little data exists on the effects of exposure to PFAS at environmentally relevant concentrations and this hampers the effective management of these compounds. This paper reviews current research on the occurrence and ecotoxicology of PFAS at environmentally relevant doses to assess their potential biological impacts. Hazard Quotient (HQ) analysis was undertaken as part of this assessment. Most PFAS detected in the environment were found to have a HQ risk value of <1 meaning their reported concentrations are below their predicted no effect concentration. This indicates many reported toxic effects of PFAS are, theoretically, unlikely to occur outside the laboratory. However, lack of information on new PFAS as well as their precursors and degradation products, coupled with lack of knowledge of their mixture toxicity means our understanding of the risks of PFAS is incomplete, especially in regard to sub-lethal and/or chronic effects. It is proposed that the development of molecular markers for PFAS exposure are needed to aid in the development of environmental PFAS regulations that are effective in fully protecting the environment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Degradation; Toxicity; Biological impacts; Degradation products; Effective management; Hazard quotients; Mixture toxicity; Molecular marker; Predicted no-effect concentrations; Synthetic chemicals; Environmental regulations; biomarker; concentration (composition); ecological impact; ecotoxicology; environmental monitoring; environmental response; environmental risk; molecular analysis; pollution exposure; regulatory approach; ecotoxicology; metabolomics; review; environmental exposure; human; procedures; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Ecotoxicology; Environmental Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Humans"

Because of the strong electrophilicity, high oxidizing properties, low toxicity, air and moisture stability, ready availability, ease of handling, and mild reaction conditions, the hypervalent iodine reagents have been widely utilized in modern organic chemistry. In particular, the use of hypervalent iodine reagents to initiate the C−F and C−Rfn (Rfn=CF2H, CF3, perfluoroalkyl, OCH2CF3, SCF3, SeCF3 and etc) bond formation has been increasingly developed. In these reactions, hypervalent iodine compounds behave as powerful oxidants or electrophiles and activate the fluorination/fluoroalkylation reagents, the transition-metal catalysts, or the substrates to in situ form electrophilic or radical intermediates, which subsequently participate in fluorination, difluoromethylation, trifluoromethylation, perfluoroalkylation, trifluoroethoxylation, fluoroalkylthiolation, trifluoromethylselenolation and others under mild conditions. Although great achievements have been made in this area, they are just the initial phase and still require a wide scope for improvement. It is anticipated that this review will draw much attention from the organic chemistry community and inspire more contributions in the development of new hypervalent-iodine-mediated fluorination and fluoroalkylation reactions.

This paper synthesises literature about the status of the pollutants and their precursors, identifies knowledge gaps and discusses future perspectives on the study of PFASs in Africa. Limited data on PFASs prevalence in Africa is available because there is limited capacity to monitor PFASs in African laboratories. The levels of PFASs in Africa are higher in samples from urban and industrialized areas compared to rural areas. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are the dominant PFASs in human samples from Africa. Levels of PFOS and PFOA in these samples are lower than or comparable to those from industrialized countries. PFOA and PFOS levels in drinking water in Africa are, in some cases, higher than the EPA drinking water guidelines suggesting potential risk to humans. The levels of PFASs in birds' eggs from South Africa are higher, while those in other environmental media from Africa are lower or comparable to those from industrialized countries. Diet influences the pollutant levels in fish, while size and sex affect their accumulation in crocodiles. No bioaccumulation of PFASs in aquatic systems in Africa could be confirmed due to small sample sizes.

However, with only six years follow-up on average, little is known about the long-term durability of transcatheter implanted biological tissue. Moreover, the high cost of biological tissue harvesting and chemical treatment procedures favor the development of alternative synthetic valve leaflet materials. In that context, thin, flexible and porous textile constructions could be considered as interesting candidates. However, these constructions must be strong enough to withstand the load applied on the leaflet especially in aortic position. Moreover, the interaction of textile material with living tissue should be comparable to biological valve tissue, and the foreign body reaction (FBR) as well as the calcification mechanisms should be controlled. In the frame of heart valve tissue engineering strategies, the use of bioresorbable polymer scaffolds is expected to limit that FBR. However, to precisely control the degradation of the polymer is not trivial. Conversely, when permanent textile polymers are considered, the porosity of the fibrous scaffold tends to induce exaggerated tissue ingrowth which may prevent the implants from remaining flexible. In that context, the ideal synthetic fibrous valve leaflet remains to be found. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible strategies which have been adopted over the last 50 years regarding the use of textile as heart valve leaflet material. Results showed that textile presented potential, despite remaining strong challenges. It came out that hybrid textiles combining bioresorbable and permanent polymer fibers arranged in both non-woven and woven or knitted way could probably help providing strength and generating appropriate tissue ingrowth. © 2020 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA","collagen; macrogol; polyethylene terephthalate; polymer; polypropylene; scaffold protein; polymer; biocompatibility; blood vessel wall; calcification; cancer research; cell proliferation; encapsulation; follow up; foreign body reaction; heart valve; hemodynamics; histology; human; Leydig cell; pulmonary valve replacement; Review; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue regeneration; transcatheter aortic valve implantation; adverse event; animal; aortic valve; biodegradable implant; chemistry; convalescence; devices; foreign body reaction; heart valve prosthesis; heart valve replacement; pathophysiology; prosthesis complication; prosthesis design; risk factor; time factor; tissue engineering; treatment outcome; valvular heart disease; Absorbable Implants; Animals; Aortic Valve; Foreign-Body Reaction; Heart Valve Diseases; Heart Valve Prosthesis; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Humans; Polymers; Prosthesis Design; Prosthesis Failure; Recovery of Function; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Tissue Engineering; Treatment Outcome"

Yet, many of these studies provided important mechanistic insights on the toxicant-induced testis injury and reproductive dysfunction, relevant to the biology of the testis and spermatogenesis. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that findings obtained from toxicant models are exceedingly helpful tools to unravel the biology of testis function in particular spermatogenesis, including specific cellular events associated with spermatid transport to support spermiogenesis and spermiation.

International environmental protection agencies are currently looking for ways to detect and safely remediate both solid and aqueous PFAS waste due to their harmful effects. Incineration is a technique that disposes of chemicals by breaking down the chemicals at high temperatures, upwards of 1400◦ C. Incineration has been used on other related compounds, but PFAS presents a challenge during thermal degradation due to the molecular stability and reactivity of fluorine. Research on the efficacy of this method is currently limited, as the degradation byproducts of PFAS are not fully characterized. Current research is mostly focused on the development of benchtop methods for the safe remediation of solid PFAS waste. Aqueous fire fighting foams (AFFFs) have garnered significant attention due to extensive use since development in the 1960s. Numerous communities that are closely located near airports have been shown to have higher than average PFAS contamination from the repeated use. Detection and remediation of surface, subsurface, and wastewater have become a primary concern for environmental agencies. Use of electrochemical techniques to remove the PFAS contaminants has shown recent promise to help address this issue. Critical to the remediation efforts is development of standardized detection techniques and the implementation of local and international regulations to control the production and use of fluorinated products. No single solution has yet been developed, but much progress has been made in recent years in governmental regulation, detection, and remediation techniques. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper reviews quantification of [NH3] through measurements, satellite-remote-sensing, and modeling reported in over 500 publications towards synthesizing the current knowledge of [NH3], focusing on spatiotemporal variations, controlling processes, and quantification issues. Most measurements are through regional passive sampler networks. [NH3] hotspots are typically over agricultural regions, such as the Midwest US and the North China Plain, with elevated concentrations reaching monthly averages of 20 and 74 ppbv, respectively. Topographical effects dramatically increase [NH3] over the Indo-Gangetic Plains, North India and San Joaquin Valley, US. Measurements are sparse over oceans, where [NH3] ≈ a few tens of pptv, variations of which can affect aerosol formation. Satellite remote-sensing (AIRS, CrIS, IASI, TANSO-FTS, TES) provides global [NH3] quantification in the column and at the surface since 2002. Modeling is crucial for improving understanding of NH3 chemistry and transport, its spatiotemporal variations, source apportionment, exploring physicochemical mechanisms, and predicting future scenarios. GEOS-Chem (global) and FRAME (UK) models are commonly applied for this.

The latest 520 papers published from 2010 to 2020, which represent 70 % of the whole literature selected since 1969, were carefully screened. Reviewed studies mainly investigated: 1) the role of FTs in shaping communities; 2) the responses of macrophytes to environmental gradients; 3) the application of FTs in monitoring anthropic pressures; and 4) the reasons for success of invasive species. Studied areas were concentrated in Europe (41 %) and Asia (32 %), overlooking other important biodiversity hotspots, and only 6.2 % of the world macrophytes species were investigated in dedicated single species studies. The FTs most commonly used include leaf economic and morphological traits, and we noticed a lack of attention on root traits and in general on spatial traits patterns, as well as a relatively poor understanding of how FTs mediate biotic interactions. High-throughput techniques, such as remote sensing, allow to map fine-scale variability of selected traits within and across systems, helping to clarify multiple links of FTs with ecological drivers and processes.

A significant effort has been made by researchers towards proton conductive materials and membranes, some of which have been successfully commercialized. However, commercial perfluorosulfonic acid membranes like Nafion suffer key issues which limit their large-scale applications in a wide temperature range, including high cost and low operation temperature. Therefore, it is highly desirable to prepare new-type PEMs possessing high proton conductivity, thermal and chemical stability, water uptake and excellent durability. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are attractive candidates for proton exchange membranes due to their high porosity, ordering pore structures and excellent designability. This review focuses on the recent progress on proton-conductive MOF structures and their proton exchange membranes. In the first section, the authors briefly introduce the proton conducting mechanism of MOFs and their testing methods. The Grotthuss mechanism refers to the proton transferring process in a continuous and long-range hydrogen network, whereas the Vehicular mechanism involves in the diffusion of proton carrier molecules. Then in the next section, the authors summarize the progress on bulk MOFs proton conductors. According to the work condition, proton-conducting MOFs can be divided into two types, namely working under humid and anhydrous environment. These works show the potential of proton-conductive MOFs to be applied in a wide temperature range, and some of them even have reached a relatively high conductivity larger than 10-2 S•cm-1, comparable with Nafion. In the third section, a review on the MOFs-based proton exchange membranes is shown. Researchers have proven that MOFs thin films have huge potential on proton conduction. Nevertheless, most of the MOFs-based PEMs are still mixed matrix membrane (MMM) structure. In order to boost the performance of MMMs-type MOFs-based PEMs, several strategies can be applied such as modifying MOF with functional groups, using 1D/2D MOFs structure and introducing the third phase into membranes. Last, the authors discuss the current issues and perspectives on MOFs proton conductors and their PEMs. © 2020 Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. It is widely recognized that a reduction of Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells is an immunological hallmark of MS, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In experimental autoimmune models, N-Ras and K-Ras inhibition triggers an anti-inflammatory effect up-regulating, via foxp3 elevation, the numbers and the functional suppressive properties of Tregs. Similarly, an increase in natural Tregs number during Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) in R-RAS -/- mice results in attenuated disease. In humans, only KRAS GTPase isoform is involved in mechanism causing tolerance defects in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). T cells from these patients have increased transcription of KRAS (but not NRAS). RAS genes are major drivers in human cancers. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in developing anti-RAS inhibitors for cancer treatment. Despite efforts, no anti-RAS therapy has succeeded in the clinic. The major strategy that has so far reached the clinic aimed to inhibit activated Ras indirectly through blocking its post-translational modification and inducing its mis-localization. The disappointing clinical outcome of Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitors (FTIs) in cancers has decreased interest in these drugs. However, FTIs suppress EAE by downregulation of myelin-reactive activated T-lymphocytes and statins are currently studied in clinical trials for MS. However, no pharmacologic approaches to targeting Ras proteins directly have yet succeeded. The therapeutic strategy to recover immune function through the restoration of impaired Tregs function with the mounting evidences regarding KRAS in autoimmune mediated disorder (MS, SLE, RA, T1D) suggest as working hypothesis the direct targeting KRAS activation using cancer-derived small molecules may be clinically relevant.

Among these, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), a group of organic chemicals, have received global attention due to their estrogen eff;ect, toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation. For the removal of EDCs, conventional wastewater treatment methods include flocculation, precipitation, adsorption, etc. However, there are some limitations on these common methods. Herein, in order to enhance the public's understanding of environmental EDCs, the definition of EDCs and the characteristics of several typical EDCs (physical and chemical properties, sources, usage, concentrations in the environment) are reviewed and summarized in this paper. In particular, the methods of EDC removal are reviewed, including the traditional methods of EDC removal, photocatalysis, biodegradation of EDCs and the latest research results of EDC removal. It is proposed that photocatalysis and biodegradation could be used as an environmentally friendly and effcient EDC removal technology. Photocatalytic technology could be one of the water treatment methods with the most potential, with great development prospects due to its high catalytic effciency and low energy consumption. Biodegradation is expected to replace traditional water treatment methods and is also considered to be a highly promising method for effcient removal of EDCs.

It highlights human population-based associations as well as in vitro-based experimental data to inform an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these health effects. Among the mechanisms by which PFAS may induce toxicity is via their interaction with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), nuclear receptors that regulate lipid metabolism and placental functions important to healthy pregnancies, as well as fetal and child development. Recent Findings: In utero exposure to prevalent environmental contaminants such as PFAS is associated with negative health outcomes during pregnancy, birth outcomes, and later in life. Specifically, PFAS have been associated with increased incidence of gestational diabetes, childhood obesity, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. In terms of placental molecular mechanisms underlying these associations, studies demonstrate that PFAS interfere with trophoblast lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and invasion. Moreover these effects could be mediated in part by the interaction between PFAS and PPARs, as well as other biological mechanisms.

Ozonation efficiency is limited by ozone-resistant pollutants, whereas photocatalysis is slow due to charge recombination, yet photocatalytic ozonation overcomes these limitations. Photocatalytic ozonation indeed shows synergy indices of up to 5.8 for treating wastewaters.

These treatments require detailed knowledge of the spatial location and distribution of cardiac autonomic nerves, however, there are controversies on this subject in humans. Objective: To provide a systematic overview of current knowledge on human anatomy of the cardiac autonomic nervous system. Results: In contrast to the often claimed assumption that human preganglionic sympathetic cardiac neurons originate mainly from thoracic spinal segments T1–T4 or T5, there is ample evidence indicating involvement of cervical spinal segment C8 and thoracic spinal segments below T5. Whether cervical ganglia besides the stellate ganglion play a role in transmission of cardiac sympathetic signals is unclear. Similarly, there is debate on the origin of cardiac nerves from different thoracic ganglia. Most human studies report thoracic cardiac nerves emerging from the first to fourth thoracic paravertebral ganglia; others report contributions from the fifth, sixth and even the seventh thoracic ganglia. There is no agreement on the precise composition of nerve plexuses at the cardiac level. After years of debate, it is generally accepted that the vagal nerve contributes to ventricular innervation. Vagal distribution appears higher in atria, whereas adrenergic fibers exceed the number of vagal fibers in the ventricles. Conclusion: Anatomy of the human cardiac autonomic nervous system is highly variable and likely extends beyond generally assumed boundaries. This information is relevant for thoracic epidural anesthesia and procedures targeting neuronal modulation of cardiac sympathetic innervation. © 2020 The Authors","adrenergic nerve; adult; cardiac ganglion; cervical ganglion; cervical spine; heart atrium; heart function; heart nerve; human; neuromodulation; review; stellate ganglion; sympathetic blocking; sympathetic innervation; thoracic ganglion; thorax epidural anesthesia; vagus nerve; anatomy and histology; animal; autonomic nervous system; heart; innervation; physiology; sympathetic ganglion; Adult; Animals; Autonomic Nervous System; Ganglia, Sympathetic; Heart; Humans"

This is largely to differences in production methods; a region that produced PFAS via ECF for many years would have a higher ratio of branched isomers than one that produces PFAS using telomerization. In addition, the different structures of branched PFAS isomers as compared to linear PFAS appear to affect transport in the environment. Research suggests that linear PFAS sorb preferentially to soil and sediments, whereas branched isomers are more likely to remain in water. The higher polarity of the branched structure explains this difference. Studies in humans and animals show that most animals preferentially accumulate the linear PFOS isomer, but humans appear to preferentially accumulate the branched isomers as they are often found in human serum at percentages higher than that of ECF product. In addition, some studies have indicated that linear and branched PFAS isomers have some unique negative health associations. Very few studies, however, account for linear and branched PFAS separately. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Animals; Groundwater; Plants (botany); Branched isomers; Branched structures; Different structure; Geographic location; Long term production; Perfluorinated alkyl substances; Production methods; Soil and sediment; Isomers; ground water; perfluoro compound; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; sea water; surface water; byproduct; health impact; organohalogen; spatial distribution; transport process; absorption; analytic method; bioaccumulation; biosolid; blood level; chemical analysis; chemical composition; chemical modification; chemical parameters; chemical procedures; chemical structure; ecosystem restoration; electrochemistry; environmental health; fluorination; geography; health hazard; human; isomer; nonhuman; pregnant woman; priority journal; Review; sediment; soil pollutant; synthesis; water pollutant; wildlife; Animalia"

Recent research has focused on developing vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) for large scale energy storage owing to their cost-effectiveness, flexible design, energy efficiency and long cycle life. Nafion the preferred membrane in VRFB systems has an overall cost of more than 11% in these systems. However, due to its drawbacks of high permeability and high cost limit its suitability for commercial use. Many researchers are therefore keen to develop new chemical designs for synthetic membranes, such as perfluorinated, partially fluorinated, hydrocarbon based and organic-inorganic composite membrane. The sol-gel process, which is mainly based on hydrolysis and condensation reaction offers the possibility of homogeneous preparation of membranes, leading to high proton conductivity and reduced vanadium ion permeability, thereby greatly increasing the cell efficiency. This review summarizes recent development in the synthesis and applications of sol-gel based proton exchange membranes for VRFB system, on which many researchers have been working in recent years. We also discuss critical research areas and the future development of cost-effective sol-gel based membranes for attractive energy storage systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Composite membranes; Condensation reactions; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Membranes; Polyelectrolytes; Sol-gel process; Vanadium; Energy storage systems; Hydrolysis and condensation; Organic-inorganic composite; Partially fluorinated; Polymer electrolyte membranes; Proton exchange membranes; Vanadium ion permeabilities; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Flow batteries"

A systematic search of literature published prior to March 9th, 2020, was performed in the databases PubMed and Embase®. Predefined criteria for eligibility were applied by two authors screening study records independently. Among the 242 study records retrieved in the literature search, 26 studies were eligible for qualitative assessment. While several investigations suggested weak associations for single compounds and specific outcomes, a lack of consistency across studies limited conclusions of overall evidence. The current gap in knowledge is particularly obvious regarding exposures prior to adulthood, exposure to combinations of both PFAS and other types of environmental chemicals, and outcomes such as cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and testicular cancer.

To prepare the present review, the relevant papers were identified by searching the Scopus database and extracting papers from 2007 to 2020. There is a wide variety of different membranes, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Perfluorinated and non-fluorinated membranes were evaluated based on different properties, including proton conductivity, power density (PD), water uptake, and ion exchange capacity. Results reveal that non-fluorinated membranes such as sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK), graphene oxide/SPEEK (GO/SPEEK), polyethersulfone (PES) and polysulfone (PS) and sulfonated polybenzimidazole (S-OPBI) are a good choice to replace the commonly used membrane Nafion™ because of their lower cost and higher energy recovery. Sulfonated membranes such as polyethersulfone/SPEEK (PES/SPEEK) and Sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES) show the highest normalized energy recovery. Although Nafion™ has the highest proton conductivity and is an excellent choice as proton exchange membrane (PEM) for MFCs, its energy recovery capacity is lower than that of porous and microfiltration membranes. It can also be very sensitive to biofouling. In the following, different parameters of membrane characterization and also wastewater treatment are discussed.

IPLNs are benign lesions and do not require follow-up after initial detection. There are indications that IPLNs represent a considerable portion of incidentally found pulmonary nodules seen at high-resolution CT. The reliable and accurate identification of IPLNs as benign nodules may substantially reduce the number of unnecessary follow-up CT examinations. Typical CT features of IPLNs are a noncalcified solid nodule with sharp margins; a round, oval, or polygonal shape; distanced 15 mm or less from the pleura; and most being located below the level of the carina. The term perifissural nodule (PFN) was coined based on some of these characteristics. Standardization of those CT criteria are a prerequisite for accurate nodule classification. However, four different definitions of PFNs can currently be found in the literature. Furthermore, there is considerable variation in the reported interobserver agreement, malignancy rate, and prevalence of PFNs.

The metabolism of compounds commonly found in living things is limited to several thousand metabolites whereas ∼100 million chemical substances have been devised by chemical synthesis, and ∼100 000 are used commercially. Since most of those compounds are not natively found in living things, and some are toxic or carcinogenic, the question arises as to whether there is some organism somewhere with the enzymes that can biodegrade them. Repeatedly, anthropogenic chemicals have been denoted 'non-biodegradable,' only to find they are reactive with one or more enzyme(s). Enzyme reactivity has been organized into categories of functional group transformations. The discovery of new functional group transformations has continually expanded our knowledge of enzymes and biodegradation. This expansion of new-chemical biodegradation is driven by the evolution and spread of newly evolved enzymes. This review describes the biodegradation of widespread commercial chemicals with a focus on four classes: polyaromatic, polychlorinated, polyfluorinated, and polymeric compounds. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons include some of the most carcinogenic compounds known. Polychlorinated compounds include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and many pesticides of the twentieth century. Polyfluorinated compounds are a major focus of bioremediation efforts today. Polymers are clogging landfills, killing aquatic species in the oceans and increasingly found in our bodies. All of these classes of compounds, each thought at one time to be non-biodegradable, have been shown to react with natural enzymes. The known limits of enzyme catalysis, and hence biodegradation, are continuing to expand. © 2020 The Author(s).

They are causing increasingly serious epidemiological problems in many communities globally due to consuming PFAS-contaminated water sources. Necessarily, the behavior of PFAS in water and wastewater needs to be understood better. This study attempts to comprehensively review, analyze and discuss PFAS based on the following key aspects: (i) sources, (ii) occurrence in water and wastewater, (iii) transformation, fate and migration, and (iv) remediation technologies. Studies indicated that modern water and wastewater treatment plants cannot deal completely with PFAS and in some cases, the removal efficiency is minus -3500-fold. The main reasons are the high hydrophobicity of PFAS and presence of PFAS precursors. Precursors can account for 33–63% of total PFAS concentration in water and wastewater. Detection and identification of precursors are challenging due to the requirement of advanced analytical instrument and standard chemicals. Several technologies have been developed for PFAS remediation involving two main mechanisms: separation-concentration and destruction. The most widespread in-use technology is adsorption because it is reasonably affordable. Anion exchange resin and synthesized materials are the most effective sorbents having a sorption capacity of 100–2000 mg PFAS/g sorbent, effective within a few hours. The destruction technology such as plasma can also be a promising one for degrading PFAS to below health-based standard in 1 min.

Another possibility may be that most BC studies are skewed towards individuals at average risk, which may limit the ability to detect signals from ECE. Objectives: We reviewed the literature on ECE and BC focusing on three types of studies or subgroup analyses based on higher absolute BC risk: BC family history (Type 1); early onset BC (Type 2); and/or genetic susceptibility (Type 3). Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed database to identify epidemiologic studies examining ECE and BC risk published through June 1, 2019. Results: We identified 100 publications in 56 unique epidemiologic studies. Of these 56 studies, only 2 (3.6%) were enriched with BC family history and only 11% of studies (6/56) were specifically enriched with early onset cases. 80% of the publications from these 8 enriched studies (Type 1: 8/10 publications; Type 2: 8/10 publications) supported a statistically significant association between ECE and BC risk including studies of PAH, indoor cooking, NO2, DDT; PCBs, PFOSA; metals; personal care products; and occupational exposure to industrial dyes. 74% of Type 3 publications (20/27) supported statistically significant associations for PAHs, traffic-related air pollution, PCBs, phthalates, and PFOSAs in subgroups of women with greater genetic susceptibility due to variants in carcinogen metabolism, DNA repair, oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis and tumor suppressor genes. Discussion: Studies enriched for women at higher BC risk through family history, younger age of onset and/or genetic susceptibility consistently support an association between an ECE and BC risk. In addition to measuring exposures during WOS, designing studies that are enriched with women at higher absolute risk are necessary to robustly measure the role of ECE on BC risk. © 2020 The Authors","cancer; carcinogen; epidemiology; gene expression; health risk; literature review; pollution exposure; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; breast tumor; cooking; environmental exposure; female; human; Breast Neoplasms; Cooking; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"

Although progress has been made in establishing monitoring in environmental matrices, health effects, legislation and control, there are still problems associated with regional bias and the types of EPs commonly assessed, which may underestimate the risk to health. In Latin America there are limited reports on environmental monitoring of EPs and it is generally focused on wastewater. This review identifies the current research deficiencies for emerging contaminants in the Latin American region, and we address the case of nonylphenol as an under-studied EP in the region. Nonylphenol is a degradation product of nonylphenol ethoxylate, which is a surfactant widely used in the manufacture of detergents in Latin America, environmental concentrations have been reported, predominantly in water, and the possible effects on species in this region have been also described. The importance of the review of this compound in the region lies in the fact that the Rotterdam Convention has catalogued nonylphenol as a severely restricted compound, so it is necessary to establish measures for its restriction and change to a sustainable technology. Finally, the example of NP presented in this review highlights the lack of regulation in Latin America regarding to EPs, resulting in the contamination of wastewater, effluents, rivers and drinking water.

The complete removal of Tl(I) from wastewater is of significant emergency due to its high toxicity and mobility, however, Tl(I) removal is always confronted with numerous technical difficulties because of the extremely low Tl(I) concentration in wastewater and the disturbances of many accompanying impurity ions. Adsorption is currently the most widely used method for Tl(I) removal on industrial scale and varied kinds of adsorbents such as Prussian blue analogues, biosorbents, and metal oxides have been developed. However, the adsorption process of Tl(I) is always affected by the co-existing cations, resulting in low Tl(I) removal efficiency. Recently, the development of a variety of novel adsorbents or ion sensors based on macrocyclic compounds for enrichment and accurate determination of trace Tl(I) in aqueous solutions exhibits great potential for application in Tl(I) removal from wastewater with high selectivity and process efficiency.

Current deterministic frame-works for risk assessment lack the ability to predict the likelihood of effects and to assess uncertainty. When exposure exceeds tolerable intake levels, these shortcomings hamper risk management and communication. OBJECTIVE: The integrated probabilistic risk assessment (IPRA) combines dose-response and exposure data to estimate the likelihood of adverse effects. We evaluated the usefulness of the IPRA for risk characterization related to decreased levels of total triiodothyronine (T3) in humans following a real case of high exposure to PFAS via drinking water. METHODS: PFAS exposure was defined as serum levels from residents of a contaminated area in Ronneby, Sweden. Median levels were 270 ng=mL [perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)] and 229 ng=mL [perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS)] for individuals who resided in Ronneby 1 y before the exposure termination. This data was integrated with data from a subchronic toxicity study in monkeys exposed daily to PFOS. Benchmark dose modeling was employed to describe separate dose–effect relationship for males and females, and extrapolation factor distributions were used to estimate the corresponding human benchmark dose. The critical effect level was defined as a 10% decrease in total T3. RESULTS: The median probability of critical exposure, following a combined exposure to PFOS and PFHxS, was estimated to be [2.1% (90% CI: 0:4%–13:1%)]. Gender-based analysis showed that this risk was almost entirely distributed among women, namely [3.9% (90% CI: 0:8%–21:6%)]. DISCUSSION: The IPRA was compared with the traditional deterministic Margin of Exposure (MoE) approach. We conclude that probabilistic risk characterization represents an important step forward in the ability to adequately analyze group-specific health risks. Moreover, quantifying the sour-ces of uncertainty is desirable, as it improves the awareness among stakeholders and will guide future efforts to improve accuracy. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6654. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

In this paper we review various grouping strategies that could be used to inform actions on these chemicals and outline the motivations, advantages and disadvantages for each. Grouping strategies are subdivided into (1) those based on the intrinsic properties of the PFAS (e.g. persistence, bioaccumulation potential, toxicity, mobility, molecular size) and (2) those that inform risk assessment through estimation of cumulative exposure and/or effects. The most precautionary grouping approach of those reviewed within this article suggests phasing out PFAS based on their high persistence alone (the so-called ""P-sufficient""approach). The least precautionary grouping approach reviewed advocates only grouping PFAS for risk assessment that have the same toxicological effects, modes and mechanisms of action, and elimination kinetics, which would need to be well documented across different PFAS. It is recognised that, given jurisdictional differences in chemical assessment philosophies and methodologies, no one strategy will be generally acceptable. The guiding question we apply to the reviewed grouping strategies is: grouping for what purpose? The motivation behind the grouping (e.g. determining use in products vs. setting guideline levels for contaminated environments) may lead to different grouping decisions. This assessment provides the necessary context for grouping strategies such that they can be adopted as they are, or built on further, to protect human and environmental health from potential PFAS-related effects. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Biochemistry; International trade; Motivation; Philosophical aspects; Risk perception; Bioaccumulation potential; Contaminated environment; Cumulative exposures; Elimination kinetics; Environmental health; Grouping strategies; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Toxicological effects; Risk assessment; bioaccumulation; environmental health; human; kinetics; molecular size; motivation; philosophy; practice guideline; review; risk assessment; toxicology; fluorocarbon; Bioaccumulation; Environmental Health; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Risk Assessment"

They are reported as ubiquitous pollutants in different spheres of the environment due to the presence of physical bonding with the polymeric matrix. In animals, including humans, they are known to cause various toxic effects. Nevertheless, less attention has been paid to phthalate induced stress in plants, since plants are equally vulnerable to their exposure as they are immobile and being an important component of the environment cannot be ignored. Moreover, due to their frequent detection in higher amounts in agricultural soils globally, significant concern has been raised about phthalate induced stress in plants over the past decade. The main sources of phthalate in agricultural soils are the use of plastic mulching, irrigation with wastewater, pesticide spraying, use of biosolids for improving soil properties, etc. From the soils, phthalates could enter into plants mainly via roots and undergo biomagnification at different trophic levels in an ecosystem. Phthalates were declared as endocrine disruptors thereby, their accumulation in edible plants raises food security concerns. Moreover, the accumulation of phthalates in plants is observed to affect germination, growth and development as well as reported to interfere with normal plant metabolism which led to modulations in the content of pigments, osmolytes, stress biomarkers and activities of antioxidative enzymes, thus reducing the yield and quality of edible plants. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",

Preliminary studies indicate that a few kinds of technical approaches could remove or transfer PFASs, but the effectiveness is not high as expected or limited while most of the techniques are only tested at laboratory scale. A review of existing treatment technologies was thus conducted for the purpose to outlook these technologies, and more importantly, to propose the foreseeable technique.

Data sources, design and eligibility criteria PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched from inception to 6 June 2018 for studies primarily addressing the association between exposure to EDCs after the age of 2 years and anthropometric measures of obesity or body fat. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias. Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers screened and conducted data extraction and synthesis. A third reviewer resolved disagreements. Results A total of 73 studies investigating bisphenol A (32 286 individuals), organochlorine compounds (34 567 individuals), phthalates (21 401 individuals), polybrominated biphenyls (2937 individuals), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (5174 individuals), parabens (4097 individuals), benzoic acid (3671 individuals) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (349 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Most had a cross-sectional design and low or medium risk of bias. In qualitative analysis, bisphenol A and phthalates were consistently associated with general and abdominal obesity, in children and adults, and some studies suggested this association was age-dependent and gender-dependent. Meta-analysis indicated a significant association between exposure to bisphenol A and overweight (OR 1.254, 95% CI 1.005 to 1.564), obesity (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.273 to 1.774) and increased waist circumference (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.267 to 1.783) in adults, and between exposure to 2,5-dichlorophenol and obesity in children (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1018 to 3.184). Conclusion Most observational studies supported a positive association between obesity and exposure to EDCs. Although causality cannot be determined from these data, they underscore the need to limit human exposure to EDCs in light of the evidence from animal and cell-based studies indicating the effects of these chemicals on adiposity.

Therefore, the chromatographic techniques hyphenated with high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) trend to become indispensable methods for suspect and non-target screening of emerging halogenated contaminants. HRMS is also an effective tool for tentatively identification of the micropollutants' transformation products existing in much lower concentrations. To assess the transformation pathway of halogenated contaminants in environment, the non-target screening methods must be combined with biodegradation lab experiments and also with advanced oxidation and reduction processes that can mimic the transformation on these contaminants in environment.

It is characterized by a number of symptoms induced by the exposure of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa to allergenic proteins belonging to class 1 or to class 2 food allergens. OAS occurring when patients sensitized to pollens are exposed to some fresh plant foods has been called pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS). In the wake of PFAS, several different associations of allergenic sources have been progressively proposed and called syndromes. Molecular allergology has shown that these associations are based on IgE co-recognition taking place between homologous allergens present in different allergenic sources. In addition, the molecular approach reveals that some allergens involved in OAS are also responsible for systemic reactions, as in the case of some food Bet v 1-related proteins, lipid transfer proteins and gibberellin regulated proteins. Therefore, in the presence of a convincing history of OAS, it becomes crucial to perform a patient's tailored molecule-based diagnosis in order to identify the individual IgE sensitization profile. This information allows the prediction of possible cross-reactions with homologous molecules contained in other sources. In addition, it allows the assessment of the risk of developing more severe symptoms on the basis of the features of the allergenic proteins to which the patient is sensitized. In this context, we aimed to provide an overview of the features of relevant plant allergenic molecules and their involvement in the clinical onset of OAS. The value of a personalized molecule-based approach to OAS diagnosis is also analyzed and discussed. © 2020 The Author(s).","allergen; Bet v 1 protein; cysteine proteinase; gibberellin regulated protein; immunoglobulin E; latex; lipid transfer protein; plant protein; profilin; seed storage protein; unclassified drug; allergy test; clinical feature; cross reaction; diagnostic value; disease association; disease risk assessment; disease severity; food allergy; human; immunology; medical history; molecular diagnosis; nonhuman; oral allergy syndrome; personalized medicine; plant; pollen food allergy syndrome; prick test; priority journal; protein structure; Review; sensitization"

This is an actin-binding molecular motor essential for development that participates in many crucial cellular processes such as adhesion, cell migration, cytokinesis and polarization, maintenance of cell shape and signal transduction. Several types of mutations in the MYH9 gene cause an array of autosomal dominant disorders, globally known as MYH9-related diseases (MYH9-RD). These include May-Hegglin anomaly (MHA), Epstein syndrome (EPS), Fechtner syndrome (FTS) and Sebastian platelet syndrome (SPS). Although caused by different MYH9 mutations, all patients present macrothrombocytopenia, but may later display other pathologies, including loss of hearing, renal failure and presenile cataracts. The correlation between the molecular and cellular effects of the different mutations and clinical presentation are beginning to be established. In this review, we correlate the defects that MYH9 mutations cause at a molecular and cellular level (for example, deficient filament formation, altered ATPase activity or actin-binding) with the clinical presentation of the syndromes in human patients. We address why these syndromes are tissue restricted, and the existence of possible compensatory mechanisms, including residual activity of mutant NMII-A and/ or the formation of heteropolymers or co-polymers with other NMII isoforms.","myosin heavy chain; myosin IIA; genetics; human; metabolism; mutation; perception deafness; phenotype; thrombocytopenia; Hearing Loss, Sensorineural; Humans; Mutation; Myosin Heavy Chains; Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIA; Phenotype; Thrombocytopenia"

One to 5% of people suffer from food allergies and clinicians report increasing numbers of pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS), such that the symptoms have broadened from respiratory to gastrointestinal, and even to anaphylactic shock in the presence of cofactors. Thirty to 60% of food allergies are associated with pollen allergy while the percentage of pollen allergies associated to food allergy varies according to local environment and dietary habits Areas covered: Articles published in peer-reviewed journals, covered by PubMed databank, clinical data are discussed including symptoms, diagnosis, and management. A chapter emphasizes the role of six well-known allergen families involved in PFAS: PR10 proteins, profilins, lipid transfer proteins, thaumatin-like proteins, isoflavone reductases, and β-1,3 glucanases. The relevance in PFAS of three supplementary allergen families is presented: oleosins, polygalacturonases, and gibberellin-regulated proteins. To support the discussion a few original relevant results were added. Expert opinion: Both allergenic sources, pollen and food, are submitted to the same stressful environmental changes resulting in an increase of pathogenesis-related proteins in which numerous allergens are found. This might be responsible for the potential increase of PFAS. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","1,3 beta glucanase; antihistaminic agent; bet v 1 like protein; glycosylated protein; isoflavone reductase; lipid transfer protein; oleosin; polygalacturonase; profilin; snakin gibberellin regulated protein; thaumatin; thaumatin like protein; unclassified drug; allergen; plant protein; clinical examination; cross reaction; desensitization; food allergy; human; pathogenesis; pollen allergy; prevalence; prick test; protein family; Review; systematic review; food allergy; immunology; pollen; pollen allergy; syndrome; Allergens; Cross Reactions; Food Hypersensitivity; Humans; Plant Proteins; Pollen; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal; Syndrome"

It is known that various PFAS are quantifiable in human in blood, but potential adverse health outcomes remain unclear. Sentinel and non-traditional model species are useful to study potential toxicity of PFAS in order to understand the relationship between environmental and human health. Here, we present a critical review of studies on the neurotoxicity of PFAS in sentinel and non-traditional laboratory model systems, including Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode), Dugesia japonica (planarian), Rana pipiens (frogs), Danio rerio and Oryzias melastigma (fish), and Ursus maritimus (polar bears). PFAS have been implicated in developmental neurotoxicity in non-traditional and traditional model systems as well as sentinel species, including effects on neurotransmitter levels, especially acetylcholine and its metabolism. However, further research on the mechanisms of toxicity needs to be conducted to determine if these chemicals are affecting organisms in a similar manner. Overall, findings tend to be similar among the various species, but bioaccumulation may vary, which needs to be taken into account in future studies by quantifying target organ concentrations of PFAS to better compare different species. Furthermore, data on the majority of PFAS is lacking in neurotoxicity testing, and additional studies are needed to corroborate findings thus far. © 2020 by the authors.","acetylcholine; perfluoroalkanoic acid; perfluorobutane sulfonate; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; adverse outcome; Anura; bioaccumulation; Caenorhabditis elegans; drinking; Dugesia japonica; human; motor performance; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; Oryzias melastigma; polar bear; prediction; Rana pipiens; Review; sentinel species; walking; zebra fish"

Therefore, there is growing concern about how to act to stop the increase in environmental pollution. Some of these compounds that began to accumulate in the environment since the last century are well known by the scientific community and are widely called persistent pollutants. This group includes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and heavy metals, among others. However, other compounds that have not been considered as contaminants have appeared recently. These are the so-called emerging pollutants, which involve a long list of compounds including drugs, hormones, antimicrobials, plasticizers, UV filters, etc. Through the study of different organisms, the presence of these pollutants in natural environments as well as the harmful effects they cause to the biota present in said media are being deeply investigated.

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) do not always mitigate the presence of these emerging contaminants in effluents discharged into the environment, although the removal efficiency of WWTP varies based on the techniques used. This main subject is framed within a broader environmental paradigm, such as the transition to a circular economy. The research and innovation within the WWTP will play a key role in improving the water resource management and its surrounding industrial and natural ecosystems. Even though bioremediation is a green technology, its integration into the bio-economy strategy, which improves the quality of the environment, is surprisingly rare if we compare to other corrective techniques (physical and chemical).

The data reveal that, despite the advantages that are associated with bioremediation, it is not the first option in the case of the recovery of systems contaminated with PPCPs. The results also show that fungi and bacteria are the most frequently studied microorganisms, with the latter being more easily implanted in complex biotechnological systems (78% of bacterial manuscripts vs. 40% fungi).

Catalyst supports discussed in this work are from the group of oxides, mesoporous silicas and zeolites, carbon-based materials, and carbides. Reaction conditions studied and discussed are reaction temperature, gas hourly space velocity of syngas and hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio in syngas and reaction pressure. For iron-based catalysts, reaction temperature is discussed in the range of 508–613 K, while for cobalt types in the range of 468–513 K. Reaction pressure is discussed for both catalyst types up to 3 MPa.

Although the pneumococcal capsule has been considered a sine qua non for virulence, the emergence of pathogenic nonencapsulated strains with newly recognized virulence determinants has also been described. Not unexpectedly, but of concern, nonencapsulated strains are unaffected by current pneumococcal vaccines. This, together with the finding of novel virulence factors, as well as new mechanisms of pathogenicity of established virulence determinants, underscores the resilience of the pneumococcus in confronting challenges in its environment, most importantly those posed by antibiotics and vaccines.SummaryRecent advances in the understanding of pneumococcal virulence factors provide potential opportunities for the development of novel putative therapeutic or preventive strategies.

Several federal departments are involved in different aspects of this work. Significant PFAS work is carried out under the Federal Contaminated Sites Action Plan (FCSAP), which provides a structure for the dozens of departments that are implicated in federal contaminated sites management in Canada. The work carried out under FCSAP is largely related to the PFAS resulting from aqueous film forming foams (AFFF) use. The Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) is another program with significant involvement in the assessment and management of certain PFAS. This work includes the publication of screening assessments on perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (LC-PFCAs) which led to their regulation. Risk assessments identify whether a chemical substance poses a risk, and if so, risk managers determine how best to minimise or eliminate the risk to protect the public and the environment. Highlights of work carried out under FCSAP, CMP, and existing regulations are discussed herein. Environmental quality guidelines and drinking water quality guidelines provide benchmarks for the quality of the ambient environment. Canadian federal guidelines or screening values to protect human health are now available for eleven (11) PFAS, while values to protect ecological receptors are available for PFOS. Development of our understanding, including the review of new information on PFAS (those for which guidelines exist and additional substances) is ongoing. Ongoing scientific research and risk management at contaminated sites in Canada have also been part of efforts by multiple federal departments in Canada. In this report, we will outline some of these projects and how they inform the development of additional environmental quality guidelines and advance contaminated sites risk management. © 2020",

The current review is focused on emerging pollutants occurring in food or air and include caffeine and nicotine, as well as on pharmaceuticals, in particular amoxicillin, and the concerns caused by its wide usage for medical purposes. This review, for the first time, analyzes and discusses the potential risks and implications of caffeine, nicotine and amoxicillin as emerging environmental pollutants, a field that remains underrepresented to date. Both caffeine and nicotine belong to life style compounds, while pharmaceutical amoxicillin is one of the very popular β-lactam antibiotics used to take care of human and animal infections. The review covers the toxic effect caused by caffeine, nicotine and amoxicillin on humans and animals and describes some of the main adsorbents utilized for their removal (e.g., grape stalk, tea waste, wheat grains, bentonite, activated carbon, acid and base modified grape slurry wastes, graphene oxides, modified graphene oxides, zeolites, etc.). The isotherm and kinetic models for the analysis of caffeine, nicotine and amoxicillin adsorption by different adsorbents are presented. The impact of pH, temperature, adsorbent dosage and thermodynamic studies were deeply analyzed. The review also discusses the mechanism of adsorption for the above-mentioned emerging pollutants, which includes π–π interaction, cation-π bonding, electron-donor and electron-acceptor forces, van der Waals forces, electrostatic interactions, etc. The present review has a potential value for chemists, ecologists, toxicologists, environmental engineers, and other professionals that are involved in environmental protection. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","acid; activated carbon; adsorbent; amoxicillin; base; bentonite; caffeine; cation; graphene oxide; nicotine; zeolite; amoxicillin; caffeine; nicotine; adsorption; antibiotics; environmental protection; human activity; isotherm; literature review; pollutant removal; reaction kinetics; slurry; thermodynamics; toxicity; wastewater treatment; agricultural slurry; air pollution; dangerous goods; ecologist; electron; environmental protection; food contamination; grape; kinetics; pH; Review; static electricity; tea; temperature; thermodynamics; waste water management; wheat; adsorption; ecosystem; waste water; water pollutant; Animalia; Triticum aestivum; Vitaceae; Adsorption; Amoxicillin; Caffeine; Ecosystem; Kinetics; Nicotine; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

This study provides a critical review on the mechanisms and performance of reductive destruction of PFAS with eaq -. Unique properties of eaq - and its generation in different ARP systems, particularly UV/sulfite and UV/iodide, are overviewed. Different degradation mechanisms of PFAS chemicals, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and others (e.g., short chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs), per- A nd polyfluoro dicarboxylic acids, and fluorotelomer carboxylic acids), are reviewed, discussed, and compared. The degradation pathways of these PFAS chemicals rely heavily upon their head groups. For specific PFAS types, fluoroalkyl chain lengths may also affect their reductive degradation patterns. Degradation and defluorination efficiencies of PFAS are considerably influenced by solution chemistry parameters and operating factors, such as pH, dose of chemical solute (i.e., sulfite or iodide) for eaq - photoproduction, dissolved oxygen, humic acid, nitrate, and temperature. Furthermore, implications of the state-of-the-art knowledge on practical PFAS control actions in water industries are discussed and the priority research needs are identified.

The etiology of T1D is not fully understood but it seems multifactorial. The genetic background determines the predisposition to develop T1D, while the autoimmune process against β-cells seems to be also determined by environmental triggers, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Environmental EDCs may act throughout different temporal windows as single chemical agent or as chemical mixtures. They could affect the development and the function of the immune system or of the β-cells function, promoting autoimmunity and increasing the susceptibility to autoimmune attack. Human studies evaluating the potential role of exposure to EDCs on the pathogenesis of T1D are few and demonstrated contradictory results. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize experimental and epidemiological studies on the potential role of exposure to EDCs in the development of T1D. We highlight what we know by animals about EDCs’ effects on mechanisms leading to T1D development and progression. Studies evaluating the EDC levels in patients with T1D were also reported. Moreover, we discussed why further studies are needed and how they should be designed to better understand the causal mechanisms and the next prevention interventions. © 2020 by the authors.

It can help provide insight into the ""black box"" and increase the understanding of the complex processes in CWs. In the last few decades, several process-based numerical models were developed to depict the pollutants removal processes in CWs, which include biochemical model, hydraulic model, reactive-transport model, plants model, clogging model, and coupling model combining two or more sub-models. However, there was a long way to go before fully understanding the decontamination mechanisms of CWs. On the one hand, single or a composite model coupling a small number of sub-models cannot fully reveal the decontamination processes. On the other hand, a comprehensive model including all sub-models of current cognition involves numerous parameters, most of which are interaction and cannot quantitatively determined, thus making the model complex and leading to diffuse interaction. Therefore, in order to describe the reaction processes in CWs more accurately, it is expected that all parameters should be quantified as far as possible in the future model. This study aims to provide a review of the numerical models of CWs and to reveal mechanism of decontamination. Based on the advantages and disadvantages of existing models, the study presented the improvement method and future research direction: (1) new detection/monitoring technique or computing method to quantitatively assess the parameters in CWs models, (2) correcting the simulation errors caused by the assumption of Activated Sludge Models (ASMs) and developing a complete biofilm reaction sub-model, (3) simplification of the comprehensive model, and (4) need of emerging pollutants modeling. © 2020 by the authors.","constructed wetland; degradation; future prospect; literature review; numerical model; parameter estimation; pollutant removal; subsurface flow"

In this review, biosorption capacity of fungal pellets towards heavy metals, dyes, phenolic compounds, humic substances, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals was reviewed. Available data about the adsorption capacity of pellets, their removal efficiency, and the operational conditions used were collected and synthesized. The studies relying on biodegradation were discarded to present only the possibilities of fungal pellets for removing these concern pollutants through biosorption. It was found that the biosorption of complex mixtures of pollutants on fungal pellets is scarcely studied, as well as the interfering effect of anions commonly found in water and wastewater.

This study reviewed existing data from open access reports and peer reviewed publications on the environmental presence of PFOA and GenX in environmental matrices such as surface water, groundwater, soil and vegetation. Published data on human exposure to PFOA and GenX (i.e. via drinking water and food as well as blood monitoring) were reviewed in order to assess the influence of the FPP on contamination of the local population. Concentrations in environmental and human exposure samples were compared to (inter)national quality standards or risk limits. The data showed higher PFOA and GenX concentrations in surface water, groundwater, soil and vegetation samples taken close to point sources, and the highest observed concentrations exceeded these standards and limits (except for PFOA in soil). Drinking water and food also contained higher PFOA and GenX concentrations in samples taken close to point sources compared to samples further away. Tolerable daily intake (TDIs) for both PFASs were exceeded, however, only in a maximum exposure scenario. Blood monitoring of the local population near the FPP, and FPP workers, confirmed high exposure can occur as blood concentrations of several individuals exceeded the safe level.

Temporal trend studies on water, sediments, bird, fish, marine mammal and the human show that the exposure of PFAS has significantly increased over the last 20–30 years. Different physical, biological and chemical treatment processes have been investigated for PFAS removal from water. However, there is a lack of detailed understating of the mechanism of removal by different methods, especially by different advanced chemical treatment processes. This article reviews PFASs removal efficacy and mechanism by the advanced chemical treatment methods from aqueous solution. Review shows that several advanced oxidation processes (e.g., electrochemical oxidation, activated persulfate oxidation, photocatalysis, UV-induced oxidation) are successful in degrading PFASs. Moreover, defluorination treatment, some thermal and non-thermal degradation processes are also found to be prominent for the degradation of PFASs with some limitations including process costs over physical treatment (e.g., sorption), production of toxic by-products and greenhouse gases. Finally, knowledge gaps concerning the advanced chemical treatment of PFASs are discussed. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Adsorption; Degradation; Electrochemical oxidation; Greenhouse gases; Health risks; Mammals; Photocatalysis; Reduction; Activated persulfate; Advanced oxidation; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Chemical treatment method; Chemical treatments; Degradation process; Natural environments; PFAS; Wastewater treatment"

India is the largest user of groundwater where the presence of micropollutants in the subsurface environment has been the focus of many researchers. The objective of this study was to provide a detailed review of studies on micropollutants in Indian groundwater and to provide strategies for further work. It is found that the presence of pharmaceuticals, endocrine disrupting compounds, surfactants, phthalates, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, personal care products, artificial sweeteners, and pesticides in groundwater from different parts of India is reported. Pesticides and phthalate concentrations reported exceed the standard guideline values. This review points out the regions where the groundwater is prone to contamination due to micropollutants. An assessment of temporal variation in the concentration of micropollutants in groundwater has been done only by a few researchers. This study highlighted the need for more research on the possible presence of micropollutants in groundwater, especially in the major polluted rivers in cities where more pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and plastic industries are located. Practitioner Points: Organic micropollutants were not new contaminants into the environment but the one entered even decades ago which has threatening effect. The number of studies on organic micropollutants in groundwater is lesser than surface water or wastewater. Scarcity on the studies of micropollutants was a result of definite technical lack in its analysis and complexity in sample preparation. Most of the studies done were related to contamination sites and point sources. © 2019 Water Environment Federation","Drug products; Endocrine disrupters; Esters; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Pesticides; River pollution; Sugar substitutes; Surface waters; Artificial sweeteners; Contamination sites; Endocrine disrupting compound; Micropollutants; Organic micro-pollutants; Personal care products; Standard guidelines; Subsurface environment; Groundwater pollution; alkyl group; endocrine disruptor; fluorine derivative; ground water; organic compound; pesticide; phthalic acid; river water; surface water; surfactant; sweetening agent; pesticide; chemical pollutant; groundwater; organic pollutant; pesticide; phthalate; point source pollution; PPCP; surface water; India; plastic industry; priority journal; Review; waste water; water pollutant; water supply; environmental monitoring; India; India; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; India; Pesticides; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Consequently, the sources of such pollution have been studied for the past 50 years, with the vehicular transportation sector and the atmospheric deposition identified early as the major pollution sources. In search for mitigation of this pollution, source controls, besides other measures, were recognised as effective pollution mitigation tools, whose successful implementation requires a good knowledge of pollution sources. Even though great research efforts have been exerted to document specific sources of urban runoff pollution, or specific groups of pollutants present in urban runoff, a comprehensive overview of all known contributing sources is still missing. This review contributes to closing this gap by compiling findings of previous research and critically synthesizing the current knowledge of various stormwater pollution sources. As the emphasis is placed on the sources, the related issues of implications for urban surface water quality and possible source controls for individual sources are touched upon just briefly, where required. The review showed that the atmospheric deposition, vehicular transportation-related activities and metallic building envelopes continue to be among the major pollution sources, which have been studied in a far greater detail than other sources. Furthermore, it was noted that because of the rapid advances in clean manufacturing and pollution control technologies, a large part of the body of data on stormwater quality available in the literature should be considered as historical data, which may no longer describe well the current conditions. Progressing historical data obsolescence, combined with continuing releases of new materials and chemicals, and, in some cases of new substances of potential concern, into the environment, suggests that the identification of important stormwater runoff/snowmelt pollution sources, and the associated pollutants, has been and will remain to be a work in progress. © 2019 The Authors","Atmospheric chemistry; Deposition; Deterioration; Meteorological problems; Obsolescence; Quality control; River pollution; Runoff; Sewage; Snow melting systems; Storm sewers; Storms; Water pollution control; Water quality; Diffuse pollution; Emerging pollutants; Snowmelt; Source control; Stormwater quality; Air pollution; storm water; surface water; chemical pollutant; pollutant source; pollution control; runoff; snowmelt; stormwater; urban pollution; water quality; atmospheric deposition; domestic waste; dumping; forest; gardening; human; industrialization; motor vehicle; nonhuman; pet animal; pollution monitoring; priority journal; recreational park; Review; runoff; snowmelt runoff; surface area; urban area; waste disposal; water pollution; water quality; wildlife"

They have been detected ubiquitously in ambient water along with other environmental matrices, and their adverse effects on aquatic organisms have been a subject of active investigation. Here, we intended to summarize and synthesize the existing body of knowledge on PFAA toxicity through an extensive literature review, and shed light on areas where further research is warranted. PFAA toxicity appears to be influenced by the sex and developmental stages of aquatic organisms, but not significantly by exposure route. PFAA-induced aquatic toxicity could be classified as metabolism disturbance, reproduction disruption, oxidative stress, developmental toxicity, thyroid disruption, etc. At the molecular level, these responses can be initiated by key events, such as nuclear receptor activation, reactive oxygen species induction, or interaction with a membrane, followed by a cascade of downstream responses. PFAA-induced toxicity involves diverse metabolic processes, and therefore elucidating crosstalk or interactions among diverse metabolic pathways is a challenging task. In the presence of other chemicals, PFAAs can function as agonists or antagonists, resulting in different directions of combined toxicity. Therefore, mixture toxicity with other groups of chemicals is another research opportunity. Experimental evidence supports the trans-generational toxicity of PFAAs, suggesting that their long-term consequences for aquatic ecosystems should become of concern. A recent global ban of several PFAAs resulted in an increasing dependence on PFAA alternatives. The lack of sufficient toxicological information on this emerging group of chemicals warrant caution and rigorous toxicological assessments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic ecosystems; Cell proliferation; Chemicals; Consumer products; Metabolism; Molecular oxygen; Oxidative stress; Toxicity; Aquatic toxicity; Lipid metabolisms; PFAA; Reproductive toxicities; Xenobiotic response; Aquatic organisms; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; aquatic organism; chemical pollutant; fish; lipid; metabolism; oxidative stress; pollution effect; reproductive behavior; toxicity; xenobiotics; aquatic environment; aquatic species; developmental stage; developmental toxicity; downstream processing; evidence based medicine; fish; metabolic disorder; molecular interaction; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; Review; sex; synthesis; toxicity; animal; aquatic species; ecosystem; sea food; water pollutant; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Ecosystem; Fishes; Fluorocarbons; Seafood; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

China is one of the countries with a high density of lakes in the world. Lakes play an important role in many aspects such as water supply, fisheries, and maintenance of ecosystem diversity. In addition, lakes are important sinks of POPs. The POPs in lake water can absorb and be utilized by aquatic organisms, which poses great risk to ecosystems and human health. Therefore, the distribution of POPs in lake water has an important impact on the surrounding ecosystem and human health. We collected 80 articles on the topic of POPs in Chinese lake water published from 2003 to February 2019. We collected and analyzed the published data of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDX), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated diphenyl ethers (PCDEs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and phthalate esters (PAEs). The POPs in Chinese lake water have been investigated in 49 lakes, involving 19 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China, mainly located in the eastern region (n=32), and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (n=14). There were fewer studies in the Qinghai-Xinjiang Lake District (n=3), and other areas. Among them, PAHs, HCHs and DDX were the most studied POPs. Their average concentrations of ΣPAHs, ΣHCHs, and ΣDDX in Chinese lake water were 360.0±433.8 ng/L (n=26), 12.8±23.5 ng/L (n=30), and 12.8±24.6 ng/L (n=24). The concentrations of POPs in water of eastern lakes were higher than those in lakes in other areas. Although the relative proportions of ΣPAHs, ΣHCHs and ΣDDX to the concentration of total pollutants did not change significantly before and after the year of 2010, their concentrations decreased, suggesting that the compliance with the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and the mitigation of PAHs were effective in China. The depth of water (overlying water and interstitial water), sampling location (the inlet and outlet of lakes and within the lakes) were important factors for concentrations of POPs in Chinese lake water. The concentrations of POPs in Chinese lake water were correlated with human activities such as agricultural farming, domestic sewage, industrial sewage, and docks, and the type of POPs and geographical location of the studied area. Based on the research data collected from a large number of published literatures, this review revealed the distribution characteristics of POPs in Chinese lake water, and provided a scientific basis for the control and mitigation of POPs in Chinese lakes. © 2020 by Journal of Lake Sciences.","Aquatic ecosystems; Aquatic organisms; Esters; Ethers; Health risks; Importance sampling; Lake pollution; Lakes; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Reservoirs (water); Sewage; Water supply; Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane; Distribution characteristics; Lake waters; Occurrence; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Organic pollutants"

These include a variety of subtypes including partial facet joint resection, complete facet joint resection, opening wedge osteotomy (OWO), and closing wedge osteotomy (CWO). The partial facet joint resection provides limited lordosis but can be applied across multiple levels and provides bony surface for fusion. Complete facet joint resection can also be performed across multiple segments for a cumulative effect and like the partial facet joint resection requires mobility of the anterior column. The OWO is traditionally performed at C7 and involves complete a complete laminectomy, facetectomy, and pediculectomy with special care to fully decompress the C8 nerve roots prior to osteotomy closure. The osteotomy utilizes a fulcrum of rotation in the middle column with shortening of the posterior column and lengthening of the anterior column with an osteoclastic fracture that must be performed with significant care. The CWO is similar to an OWO with the addition of an osteotomy into the vertebral body that is closed like a pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO).

Many transition metal-catalyzed reactions undergo net C−F bond functionalization reactions to deliver monofluorinated products. These reactions typically proceed through β-fluoroalkylmetal intermediates that readily eliminate a β-fluoride to deliver monofluoroalkene products. A second series of reactions exploit coinage metal fluorides to add F− to the gem-difluorinated alkene, and further functionalization delivers trifluoromethyl-containing products.

Human exposure to PFAS is extensive, and PFAS contamination has been reported in drinking water and food supplies as well as in the serum of nearly all people. The most well-studied member of the PFAS class, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), induces tumors in animal bioassays and has been associated with elevated risk of cancer in human populations. GenX, one of the PFOA replacement chemicals, induces tumors in animal bioassays as well. Using the Key Characteristics of Carcinogens framework for cancer hazard identification, we considered the existing epidemiological, toxicological and mechanistic data for 26 different PFAS. We found strong evidence that multiple PFAS induce oxidative stress, are immunosuppressive, and modulate receptor-mediated effects. We also found suggestive evidence indicating that some PFAS can induce epigenetic alterations and influence cell proliferation. Experimental data indicate that PFAS are not genotoxic and generally do not undergo metabolic activation. Data are currently insufficient to assess whether any PFAS promote chronic inflammation, cellular immortalization or alter DNA repair.

We describe recent developments in assessing pollutant exposures and health threats posed by industrial facilities using or releasing synthetic chemicals to nearby communities in the U.S. Recent Findings: More people are living near oil and gas development due to the expansion of unconventional extraction techniques as well as near industrial animal operations, both with suggestive evidence of increased exposure to hazardous pollutants and adverse health effects. Legacy contamination continues to adversely impact a new generation of residents in fenceline communities, with recent studies documenting exposures to toxic metals and poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Researchers are also giving consideration to acute exposures resulting from inadvertent industrial chemical releases, including those resulting from extreme weather events linked to climate change. Natural experiments of industrial closures or cleanups provide compelling evidence that exposures from industry harm the health of nearby residents.

Recent Findings: Of 37 eligible epidemiological studies among vulnerable populations published between January 2018 and April 2019 in which over half were prospective, the most investigated populations were pregnant women and children. Racial/ethnic minorities, individuals of low socioeconomic status (SES), and those occupationally exposed were studied the least. The most studied persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were per-/poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and the most studied non-POPs were phenols. Across chemical classes, studies found certain POPs (e.g., PFAS) and non-POPs (i.e., phenols, phthalates, and parabens) to be associated with gestational diabetes and dysregulated glucose metabolism. Results for other cardiometabolic health outcomes were inconsistent but suggested certain chemicals may negatively affect cardiometabolic health. Summary: Synthetic chemicals likely adversely affect cardiometabolic health, but current findings were inconclusive. Few recent studies focused on racial/ethnic minorities, low SES, and occupationally exposed populations.

Here, we review the published literature concerning PFAA impacts on neurobiological, neuroendocrine, and neurobehavioral outcomes. We find that there are many mechanisms through which PFAAs may enter the brain and interact with biochemical endpoints to impact neurological function. These results are supported by epidemiological evidence in humans and experimental evidence in animals that demonstrate numerous and varied PFAA impacts on the nervous system. However, the methods commonly used in animal models of PFAA exposure result in durations of exposure and serum PFAA concentrations in blood that may not appropriately mimic human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. If animal models lack validity, confidence in mechanistic inferences regarding PFAA exposure and brain function is reduced, limiting these studies’ utility. Finally, we end by suggesting some potential impacts of PFAA exposure in human neurological health and disease states whose associations may not readily present themselves in the epidemiological literature. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","chemical compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; absorption; blood level; body distribution; brain function; clinical outcome; environmental exposure; epidemiological data; excretion; health impact assessment; health status; human; nervous system; neuroendocrine system; neurologic disease; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; animal; animal model; brain; drug effect; nerve cell; pollutant; thyroid gland; toxicity; Animals; Brain; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Models, Animal; Neurons; Neurosecretory Systems; Thyroid Gland"

Emerging pollutants (EPs) are ubiquitous anthropogenic compounds of environmental concern that can be found at different concentration levels in matrices such as sediment, water and aquatic biota. In addition, EPs can be bioaccumulated and biomagnified, inducing adverse effects on biota, and posing a risk to humans when contaminated biota is consumed. Unlike abiotic matrices, the occurrence of EPs in aquatic biota has not been widely studied. This is probably because their complexity, due to the presence of lipids, proteins and other organic compounds, makes the extraction and analysis of EPs difficult. This review gathers the most relevant analytical methods published between 2014 and 2019, comparing them and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses. It is intended to provide a better understanding of the development of new and improved methods, and to be a reference for researchers who are looking for the best methodology for their studies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

The challenges in the analysis of these compounds in water include their poor extraction efficiencies from environmental matrices and weak retention in conventional chromatographic columns. As a result, the toxicity and environmental fate of PMOCs are largely unknown. This review will examine recent developments in sorbent and chromatographic column technologies, and other sample preparation strategies that will enable analysis of PMOCs and advance our knowledge on their fate and transport in the environment.

Research on prenatal exposures has focused on fetal outcomes and less on maternal outcomes. We reviewed epidemiologic literature on chemical exposures during pregnancy and three maternal outcomes: preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and breast cancer. We found that pregnancy can heighten susceptibility to environmental chemicals and women's health risks, although variations in study design and exposure assessment limited study comparability.

These new compounds, hereafter referred to as emerging PFASs, continue to be discovered and are now showing ubiquity in abiotic and biotic environments. Thus, there is an urgent need for robust, yet sensitive analytical methods to determine their occurrence and understand their behavior, fate, impact, and toxicity. Here, we review the up-to-date sample preparation and analytical methodologies for emerging PFASs based on peer-reviewed literature published in the past three years (2015–2018). The determination of emerging PFASs is similar to that of legacy PFASs, with satisfactory performances for most emerging PFASs achieved using conventional extraction and analytical approaches. However, the determination of certain specific analytes remains challenging due to the unavailability of standards and reference materials, low recoveries and matrix effects, background contamination, and poor sensitivities due to in-source fragmentation. Despite recent progress in identifying ionic semi-volatile PFASs with liquid chromatograph-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), our knowledge on new types of neutral volatile PFASs remains poor due to limited non-target analysis using gas chromatograph (GC)-HRMS. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Extraction; Mass spectrometry; Emerging contaminant; High resolution mass spectrometry; Non-target screenings; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Quantification; Triple quadrupole; Liquid chromatography; fluorine derivative; ground water; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; surface water; unclassified drug; airborne particle; analytic method; bioaccumulation; calibration; extraction; human; ion pair liquid extraction; limit of detection; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liquid liquid extraction; mass fragmentography; nonhuman; priority journal; quality control; quantitative analysis; Review; sediment; serum; sludge; soil; solid liquid extraction; solid phase extraction; standard; waste water"

Based on this target error of 25%, a statistical model using z-scores was applied to assess the performance of analytical laboratories for POPs and a number of matrices. Since the second round of these ‘Bi-ennial Global Interlaboratory Assessment on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)’, carried out in 2012/2013, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been included into the proficiency tests. The third round was carried out in 2016/2017. The test materials included test solutions of PFASs analytical standards, the abiotic matrices sediment, air (extract) and water and the biotic matrices fish, human milk and human plasma. The number of laboratories submitting results for PFASs remained quite stable (IL2 = 27 laboratories; IL3 = 29), but there was broader geographic distribution observed in IL3: in addition to the laboratories from Asia and the Western Europe/other groups, two laboratories from Africa participated, two from Central-Eastern Europe and one from the Latin American/Caribbean region. Considering that PFASs were introduced for the first time in round 2, the results were good to reasonable compared to those of a number of other POPs included in the same study. However, it shall also be mentioned that for some matrices and PFASs, the number of laboratories submitting results was too small and the results too scattered to derive a consensus value. This was especially true for the PFOS precursor compounds and the air matrix. Also, laboratories struggle with the analysis of the branched PFOS isomers. These interlaboratory assessments on PFASs gave promising results and demonstrated the importance of proficiency tests in an international environment to generate trust in laboratory results. The need to participate regularly in such intercomparison assessments is highlighted. The results show the current level of PFAS analysis, which varies by laboratory and by matrix rather than per geographic region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Geographical distribution; Isomers; Laboratories; Matrix algebra; Monitoring; Global monitoring; Interlaboratory assessment; LC/MS methods; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Stockholm; Organic pollutants; chemical compound; interleukin 2; interleukin 3; perfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; Africa; Asia; Caribbean; concentration (parameter); Eastern Europe; environmental aspects and related phenomena; geographic distribution; Global interlaboratory assessment; isomer; persistent organic pollutant; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Review; sediment; South and Central America; Western Europe"

Anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, and supercritical water oxidation are found to be the best-performing treatment methods. They are not only more effective in reducing sludge volume/weight and pollutants but also have lower global warming and toxicity potential compared to most of the other methods reviewed. The potential for adverse environmental effects remains owing to the release of pollutants when the products of sludge treatment are utilised, e.g. as soil amendments or fuel.

This important reagent was initially developed as an efficient trifluoromethylating agent by Professor Qing-Yun Chen and co-workers at Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1989. Since then, this reagent has been widely used in academia and industry for the copper-mediated trifluoromethylation of aryl, alkenyl, and even some alkyl halides, among others. During the last decade, this reagent was further developed as a difluorocarbene precursor as well as a radical difluoroalkylating agent under visible light promoted redox catalysis.

PFAS have strong chemical structures and their bonding with soil makes them challenging to eliminate from soil environments. Traditional methods of soil remediation have not been successful in their reduction or removal from the environment. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of existing and emerging technologies for remediating PFAS contaminated soils with guidance on which approach to use in different contexts. The functions of all remediation technologies, their suitability, limitations, and the scale applied from laboratory to the field are presented as a baseline for understanding the research need for treatment in soil environments. To date, the immobilization method has been a significant part of the remediation solution for PFAS contaminated soils, although its long-term efficiency still needs further investigation. Soil washing and thermal treatment techniques have been tested at the field scale, but they are expensive and energy-intensive due to the use of a large volume of washing solvent and the high melting point of PFAS, respectively; both methods need a large initial investment for their installation. Other remediation technologies, such as chemical oxidation, ball milling, and electron beams, have been progressed in the laboratory. However, additional research is needed to make them feasible, cost-effective and applicable in the field. © 2019","chemical compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorohexane 1 sulphonic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; soil organic matter; toxic substance; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; chemical substance; contaminated land; detection method; immobilization; separation; soil pollution; soil remediation; soil stabilization; adsorption; bioremediation; chemical binding; chemical structure; desorption; electron beam; oxidation; physical chemistry; Review; soil pollution; soil treatment; ecosystem restoration; soil; soil pollutant; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Fluorocarbons; Soil; Soil Pollutants"

Direct sample analysis of OF only applies to some techniques on consumer products, whereas others require sample pre-treatment or concentration before measurements.

Neither inter-laboratory comparison on OF analysis nor suitable certified reference materials have been used for method validation, which makes data comparability between studies challenging. A top down approach for the comprehensive assessment of OF is proposed, where OF/extractable OF is first measured, followed by target analysis to obtain unquantifiable OF concentrations using the mass balance approach.

However, data clearly characterizing the impact of environmental exposures and health endpoints in African populations is limited. To describe recent progress and identify important research gaps, we reviewed literature on environmental health research in African populations over the last decade, as well as research incorporating both genomic and environmental factors. We queried PubMed for peer-reviewed research articles, reviews, or books examining environmental exposures and health outcomes in human populations in Africa. Searches utilized medical subheading (MeSH) terms for environmental exposure categories listed in the March 2018 US National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals, which includes chemicals with worldwide distributions. Our search strategy retrieved 540 relevant publications, with studies evaluating health impacts of ambient air pollution (n=105), indoor air pollution (n = 166), heavy metals (n = 130), pesticides (n = 95), dietary mold (n = 61), indoor mold (n = 9), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs, n = 0), electronic waste (n = 9), environmental phenols (n = 4), flame retardants (n = 8), and phthalates (n = 3), where publications could belong to more than one exposure category. Only 23 publications characterized both environmental and genomic risk factors. Cardiovascular and respiratory health endpoints impacted by air pollution were comparable to observations in other countries. Air pollution exposures unique to Africa and some other resource limited settings were dust and specific occupational exposures. Literature describing harmful health effects of metals, pesticides, and dietary mold represented a context unique to Africa. Studies of exposures to phthalates, PFASs, phenols, and flame retardants were very limited. These results underscore the need for further focus on current and emerging environmental and chemical health risks as well as better integration of genomic and environmental factors in African research studies. Environmental exposures with distinct routes of exposure, unique co-exposures and co-morbidities, combined with the extensive genomic diversity in Africa may lead to the identification of novel mechanisms underlying complex disease and promising potential for translation to global public health. © Copyright © 2020 Joubert, Mantooth and McAllister.","alkyl group; heavy metal; perfluoroalkyl substance; pesticide; phenol; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; Africa; air pollution; ambient air pollution; cardiovascular disease; dust; e-waste; environmental exposure; environmental factor; environmental health; genetic risk; genome; health hazard; health impact assessment; health status; indoor air pollution; medical research; mold; occupational exposure; outcome assessment; peer review; population risk; publication; respiratory tract disease; Review"

As our knowledge on their environmental and health impacts grow, PFAS have drawn increasing regulatory attention and research interest in recent years. While long-chain PFAS have been the center of active research in the past decade or so, and while industrial production and applications of short-china PFAS continue to rise, very few studies have focused on the occurrence, fate, and transformation of short-chain PFAS in the environment. This review aimed to provide an updated overview of the state of the science about the fundamentals, occurrence, impacts and treatment of short-chain PFAS. The key findings from this review include: 1) Short-chain PFAS are more widely detected, more persistent and mobile in aquatic systems, and thus may pose more risks on the human and ecosystem health; 2) conventional adsorption, ion-exchange, and membrane filtration can remove short-chain PFAS, but are less effective than the long-chain homologues, and are challenged with poor material regeneration efficiency and disposal of process waste residual; 3) advanced oxidation such as thermolysis and sonolysis can achieve complete mineralization, but come with a high process cost; and 4) direct photolysis, oxidation/reduction, photocatalysis, and electrochemical reaction may degrade short-chain PFAS following similar degradation pathways as long-chain PFAS, but at a slower rate, and photocatalytic processes appear most promising. Overall, this review reveals an urgent need for developing more cost-effective treatment technologies for short-chain PFAS in drinking water, for advancing our knowledge on the environmental fate, transport and impacts of short-chain PFAS in the environment, and for developing science-based regulations for short-chain PFAS. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic ecosystems; Cost effectiveness; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Health risks; Industrial research; Ion exchange; Microfiltration; Organic pollutants; Photodegradation; Photolysis; Potable water; Waste disposal; Water pollution; Emerging contaminant; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); PFAS; PFOA; PFOS; Water treatment"

This review aims to (1) identify PFAS sources and fate processes relevant to agricultural systems and (2) expand on plant uptake mechanisms and plant responses to PFAS. Recent Findings: The number of PFAS being quantified in studies involving soil, water, and plants is increasing. Transformation of precursors that tend to stay in the rhizosphere can lead to long-term PFAS reservoir to plants. Some PFAS are readily taken up, particularly the shorter-chain PFAS, and can evoke metabolic responses and phytotoxic effects at high concentrations. PFAS translocation from roots to shoots occurs through both active and passive transport mechanisms. Both PFAS uptake and effects vary between and within species. Summary: As new PFAS emerge, it will be necessary to continue expanding the list of PFAS quantified in land-applied media and assessing their accumulation potential in plants. While controlled laboratory or greenhouse studies have merit, comprehensive field studies are needed to provide clarity on PFAS fate and their relative risk in agricultural systems. Field studies should include identifying site-specific PFAS sources, quantifying a broader suite of PFAS and identifying potential precursors, evaluating plant uptake of replacement PFAS, reporting of soil properties and climatic conditions, and assessing risk of impacts to source and irrigation waters. This information can be utilized to inform future studies towards evaluating and mitigating risks to our food chain associated with PFAS in agricultural systems. © 2020, The Author(s).",

Additionally, accuracy and tight sealing of stem seals are vital in fugitive emission applications where hazardous fluids such as gases or vapours may escape if a valve is not sealed properly. Soft thermoplastic and elastomer materials such as Teflon (PTFE), lip seal, V-pack, Viton as well as graphite or graphoil can be used for valve stem sealing. Appropriate stem sealing or packing depends on the process conditions where the valve will be used, including being able to withstand extreme temperatures, being resistant to aggressive fluid such as H 2S containing fluid, displaying a low friction factor to the stem, providing very good sealing capability to prevent leakage from the valve stem area, and being adequately strong and economical. The sealing capability of compression packing is defined as the ability to expand laterally against the stem and stuffing box wall when stressed by tightening the gland. The stem sealing arrangement depends on the type of valves being used and the applications. The sealing capability and performance of a valve can be validated by testing the valve stem sealing through mechanical and temperature cycles based on different American Petroleum Institute standards or by finite element analysis. The torque required to operate a valve depends on parameters such as the packing or stem sealing material, number of stem sealing rings, load of gland flange, stem surface finish, temperature, and cycling. Reducing the number of packing rings can reduce the valve torque and the actuator sizing but removing rings can also increase the risk of leakage from the valve and reduce the effectiveness of the valve seals. © 2020, ASM International.","Hydrogen sulfide; Petroleum analysis; Valves (mechanical); American Petroleum Institute standards; Elastomer materials; Extreme temperatures; Fugitive emissions; Packing rings; Process condition; Temperature cycles; Valve operation; Packing"

This study presents an institutional anesthesia protocol, defines reported anesthetic considerations, and provides a comprehensive update to inform future directions of the field. Methods: An institutional ""FT Anesthesia Protocol""was developed and applied to 2 face transplants. A systematic review of 3 databases captured FTs in the peer-reviewed literature up to February 2020. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts to include all clinical articles with FT recipient and/or donor-specific preoperative, intraoperative, and relevant postoperative anesthetic variables. Data charting guided a narrative synthesis, and quantitative synthesis reported variables as median (range). Results: Our institutional experience emphasizes the importance of on-site rehearsals, anticipation of patient-specific anesthetic and resuscitative requirements, and long-term pain management. Systematic search identified 1092 unique records, and 129 met inclusion criteria. Reports of 37 FTs in the literature informed the following anesthetic axes: donor pre- and intraoperative management during facial allograft procurement, recipient perioperative care, immunotherapy, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and pain management. Quantitative synthesis of 30 articles showed a median operative time of 18 hours (range, 9-28) and fluid replacement with 13 L (5-18) of crystalloids, 13 units (0-66) of packed red blood cells, 10 units (0-63) of fresh frozen plasma, and 1 unit (0-9) of platelets.

This paper reviews novel composite membranes that have been developed for PEM applications, including direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), hydrogen PEM fuel cells (PEMFCs), and water electrolysers (PEMWEs), aiming at overcoming the drawbacks of the commercial Nafion membranes. It provides a broad overview of the Nafion-based membranes, with organic and inorganic fillers, and non-fluorinated membranes available in the literature for which various main properties (proton conductivity, crossover, maximum power density, and thermal stability) are reported. The studies on composite membranes demonstrate that they are suitable for PEM applications and can potentially compete with Nafion membranes in terms of performance and lifetime. © 2020 by the authors.

The characteristics of OM affects the removal efficiency and influences its reactivity with disinfectants to form DBPs. Research on DBPs is interesting because of their potential carcinogenic health risks. Although the link between DBP precursors such as natural organic matter (NOM) and DBP formation is well established, knowledge on the individual NOM fractions and other DBP precursors responsible for various DBPs is poor. Moreover, data on other precursors of DBPs has not been synthesized. The aim of this paper is therefore to review literature on the quantity and quality of NOM and other DBP precursors, evaluate the formation and treatability of the individual NOM fractions, and establish their influence on the DBPs formation. Possible removal processes for DBPs and their precursors, along with their economic feasibility were discussed. The key findings were: (1) certain fractions of NOM play a pivotal role in the formation of DBPs, (2) commonly used DBP control approaches include post-formation treatment, while targeting the removal of specific DBP precursors is hard to achieve, and (3) membrane technologies, enhanced coagulation, and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are effective in removing NOM, although AOP technologies are generally not economically feasible and still need further development and up-scaling.

The cause of disease pathology is an expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats within the huntingtin gene (HTT) on chromosome 4 (4p16.3), which codes the huntingtin protein (mHTT). The common symptoms of HD include motor and cognitive impairment of psychiatric functions. Patients exhibit a representative phenotype of involuntary movement (chorea) of limbs, impaired cognition, and severe psychiatric disturbances (mood swings, depression, and personality changes). A variety of symptomatic treatments (which target glutamate and dopamine pathways, caspases, inhibition of aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, transcriptional dysregulation, and fetal neural transplants, etc.) are available and some are in the pipeline. Advancement in novel therapeutic approaches include targeting the mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein and the HTT gene. New gene editing techniques will reduce the CAG repeats. More appropriate and readily tractable treatment goals, coupled with advances in analytical tools will help to assess the clinical outcomes of HD treatments. This will not only improve the quality of life and life span of HD patients, but it will also provide a beneficial role in other inherited and neurological disorders. In this review, we aim to discuss current therapeutic research approaches and their possible uses for HD. © 2020 by the authors.

Long term consequences of the newborns' contamination by PFAS on thyroid function are of concern. The aim of this study is to assess the potential associations between PFAS contamination measured at birth and thyroid function assessed few months later. PFAS levels were previously determined in cord blood from a cohort of newborns recruited in Liege. METHOD: Parents of the children belonging to the first and the fifth quintiles of exposure to PFAS were contacted in order to measure the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in their child few months after birth. Twenty-eight children participated in the study. Moreover, we performed a literature review about associations between pre- or perinatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants and thyroid function during early childhood. RESULT: No significant difference was highlighted between both groups of contamination (Mann-Whitney, p-value = 0.91). Literature review highlighted the critical need of new longitudinal data about this problematic. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the PFAS levels at birth are not associated with TSH levels later in life. Large scale studies are required to confirm our results.Objectif : Notre but est d’étudier les associations potentielles entre contamination par les composés perfluorés (PFC) mesurée à la naissance et fonction thyroïdienne évaluée quelques mois plus tard.

Méthode : Les parents des enfants appartenant au premier et cinquième quintiles d’exposition aux PFC ont été contactés pour mesurer les niveaux de thyréostimuline (TSH) chez leurs enfants quelques mois après la naissance. Vingt-huit enfants ont été recrutés. De plus, nous avons réalisé une revue de littérature concernant les associations entre exposition pré- ou périnatale aux polluants organiques persistants (POP) et fonction thyroïdienne pendant la petite enfance. Résultat : Aucune différence significative n’a été mise en évidence entre les deux groupes de contamination (Mann-Whitney, p = 0,91). Selon, la revue de la littérature, il est indispensable de disposer de nouvelles données longitudinales relatives à la relation entre contamination par les POP et fonction thyroïdienne. Conclusion : Nos résultats suggèrent que les concentrations de PFC à la naissance ne sont pas associées aux niveaux de TSH au cours de la vie.

As an enzyme, CD13 regulates activities of numerous cytokines by cleaving their N-terminals and is involved in Ag processing by trimming the peptides bound to MHC class II. Independent of its enzymatic activity, cell membrane CD13 functions by cross-linking–induced signal transduction, regulation of receptor recycling, enhancement of FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, and acting as a receptor for cytokines. Moreover, soluble CD13 has multiple proinflammatory roles mediated by binding to G-protein–coupled receptors. CD13 not only modulates development and activities of immune-related cells, but also regulates functions of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, CD13 is important in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory disorders. Inhibitors of CD13 have shown impressive anti-inflammatory effects, but none of them has yet been used for clinical therapy of human inflammatory diseases. We reevaluate CD13’s regulatory role in inflammation and suggest that CD13 could be a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory disorders.

However, environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs), which are stable emerging pollutants, are generated as a characteristic feature during biomass pyrolysis. EPFRs can induce the formation of reactive oxygen species, which poses huge agro-environmental and human health risks. Their half-lives and persistence in both biochar residues and in the atmosphere may lead to potentially adverse risks in the environment. This review highlights the comprehensive research into these bioreactive radicals, as well as the bottlenecks of biochar production leading up to the formation and persistence of EPFRs. Additionally, a way forward has been proposed, based on two main recommendations. A global joint initiative to create an all-encompassing regulations policy document that will improve both the technological and the quality control aspects of biochars to reduce EPFR generation at the production level. Furthermore, environmental impact and risk assessment studies should be conducted in the extensive applications of biochars in order to protect the environmental and human health. The highlighted key research directions proposed herein will shape the production, research, and adoption aspects of biochars, which will mitigate the considerable concerns raised on EPFRs. © 2019 The Authors","Agricultural robots; Crops; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Free radicals; Health risks; Reactive oxygen species; Risk assessment; Risks; Agricultural crops; Bio chars; Comprehensive research; Emerging pollutants; Environmental fate; Environmental remediation; Human health risks; Quality control aspects; Environmental protection; biochar; charcoal; free radical; unclassified drug; biochar; charcoal; free radical; biochar; bioremediation; environmental fate; environmental risk; reactive oxygen species; risk assessment; carbonization; cation exchange; chemical analysis; chemical bond; decomposition; depolymerization; ecosystem restoration; electron spin resonance; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental monitoring; germination; priority journal; pyrolysis; Review; risk assessment; soil acidity; chemistry; ecosystem restoration; human; Charcoal; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Free Radicals; Humans; Pyrolysis"

The ecotoxicity and microbial resistance are considered to be major adverse environmental and health impact of pharmaceuticals even in trace amounts, which raise global concern. The recalcitrant nature of these pollutants restricts the application of the conventional treatment system for their remediation and triggers extensive research on the various advanced oxidation processes as a promising treatment system. Among them, visible-light-assisted semiconductor photocatalysis has significant potential as an efficient, low-cost, and green technology, which can use even solar energy as a clean and sustainable light source. A comprehensive review on the application of various visible light photocatalysts on the degradation of aqueous pharmaceutical pollutants was attempted to highlight their physiochemical properties, reaction mechanism, and catalytic activity in the laboratory- as well as field-scale operations. The challenges and gaps in the current literature have been identified, and recommendations for prospective research opportunities have been placed based on the findings.

This review paper aims to highlight the metabolism of diclofenac at different trophic levels, its occurrence, ecological risks, and interactive effects in the water cycle and biota over the past two decades. Increased exposure to diclofenac not only raises health concerns for vultures, aquatic organisms, and higher plants but also causes serious threats to mammals. The ubiquitous nature of diclofenac in surface water (river, lake canal, estuary, and sea) is compared with drinking water, groundwater, and wastewater effluent in the environment. This comprehensive survey from previous studies suggests the fate of diclofenac in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and may predict its persistence in the environment. This review offers evidence of fragmentary available data for the water environment, soil, sediment, and biota worldwide and supports the need for further data to address the risks associated with the presence of diclofenac in the environment.

In this review, we summarize the research progress on the spread and detection of ARB and ARG pollution related to animal husbandry. Molecular methods such as high-throughput sequencing have greatly enriched the information about ARB communities. However, it remains challenging to delineate mechanisms regarding ARG induction, transmission, and tempo-spatial changes in the whole process, from animal husbandry to multiple ecosystems. As a result, future research should be more focused on the mechanisms of ARG induction, transmission, and control.

Intensive usage of industrial compounds has led to the massive emission to the environment and therefore their potential adverse effects may endanger aquatic organisms and human health. Based on the available literatures, organotins and flame retardants are two main groups of EPs from industrial emission identified in Indonesian seafood, as well as in those worldwide. However, concentration of both EPs group detected in Indonesian seafood is relatively low than that in developed countries and the majority of South East Asian countries. Toxicological studies revealed that EPs emitted from industrial activities have to be concern, as most of the EPs attributed to endocrine disrupting chemicals. Nevertheless, study on the exposure assessment of EPs in Indonesia is very limited. Even though, the concentrations of EPs in Indonesian seafood produce exposure below tolerable daily intake (TDI) to the local consumer, the long term exposures have to be aware due to their possible continues emission and elevating concentration such as shown by flame retardants. Governmental regulation, monitoring programs, and laboratory approach are among issues to be concern in addressing EPs in Indonesia, especially from industrial emission. © 2019, Squalen BMFPB.",

Electrodiagnostic studies were in keeping with a restricted anterior horn cell disorder. Neuroimaging showed very focal spinal cord compression at the C6-7 level. Two patients underwent surgical decompression. All 3 patients were improved or stable at follow-up. Distal spondylotic amyotrophy is characterized by equal involvement of thenar and hypothenar muscles, in contrast to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Hirayama disease.

The covered papers were published in the last 5 years (2014–2019) thus providing the reader with information about the current state-of-the-art and the future potential directions of the research in pollutant monitoring using SPME. To this end, we revised the studies focused on the investigation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), pesticides, and emerging pollutants (EPs) including personal care products (PPCPs), in different environmental, food, and bio-clinical matrices. We especially emphasized the role that SPME is having in contaminant surveys following the path that goes from the environment to humans passing through the food web. Besides, this review covers the last technological developments encompassing the use of novel extraction coatings (e.g., metal-organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, PDMSovercoated fiber), geometries (e.g., Arrow-SPME, multiple monolithic fiber-SPME), approaches (e.g., vacuum and cold fiber SPME), and on-site devices.

Big efforts are continuously made to monitor their levels and identify safe thresholds. For this purpose, an essential step is to prioritize harmful substances and understand their effect on human body. Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) deserve particular attention because of their wide diffusion and potential correlation with different diseases including glucose intolerance, hyperlipidaemia, thyroid diseases, gestational diabetes mellitus and hypertension, testicular and genitourinary cancer as well as impaired kidney function. This review focuses on the renal effects of PFCs, with the attempt to clarify their occurrence and pathogenetic mechanisms.Recent findingsWe reviewed MEDLINE and EMBASE citations between 31 October 2017 and 31 May 2019 and selected human studies measuring PFCs exposure, kidney function markers and the ability of haemodialysis to remove PFCs from the circulating blood. It has been currently clarified that exposure to PFCs is linked with an impaired kidney function and that they can be removed by blood purification.SummaryFurther studies are required on the potential synergic negative effect of PFCs co-exposure with other pollutants as well as animal studies about the removal capacity of different haemodialysis membranes.

They often end up in the environment, not only being not easily decomposed but also being accumulated. Moreover, they may cause serious toxic problems such as reproductive and developmental defects, immunological toxicity, and carcinogenesis. Hence, they are called environmental pollutants. It is known that the environmental pollutants easily enter the body through various channels such as respiration, ingestion of food, and skin contact etc. in everyday life. If they enter the mother through the placenta, they can cause the disturbance in embryo development as well as malfunction of organs after birth because early prenatal developmental process is highly sensitive to toxic chemicals and stress. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that consist of inner cell mass of blastocyst differentiate into distinct cell lineages via three germ layers such as the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm due to their pluripotency. The differentiation process initiated from ESCs reflects dynamic nature of embryonic development. Therefore, ESCs have been used as a useful tool to investigate early developmental toxicities of a variety of stress. Based on relatively recent scientific results, this review would address toxicity of a few chemical substances that have been widely used as pesticide, antibiotics, and industrial excipient on ESCs based-prenatal developmental process.

The World Health Organization has listed estrogens as group 1 carcinogens. These contaminants are of substantial concern because of potential threats to human health, and aquatic organisms on long-term exposure. A range of methods, including oxidation, adsorption, electrochemical, and irradiation techniques have been employed for their remediation from aqueous systems. However, inadequate removal, toxic sludge generation, high operating costs, and the requisite for skilled operating and maintenance personnel commercially hampered the application of many methods. An interesting alternative treatment approach based on the use of oxidoreductases, particularly laccases, has recently gained amicability for the biotransformation of emerging pollutants. The use of immobilized enzymes is more cost-effective from an industrial perspective due to improved catalytic stability, reusability, reduction of product inhibition, and easier product separation. This review provides comprehensive knowledge on the use of laccases in the biodegradation of steroidal estrogens, including estrone, 17β-estradiol, and 17α-ethinylestradiol with endocrine-disrupting potency from the environment.

The periconceptional period and intrauterine life are crucial for determining long-term susceptibility to diseases. Treatments and procedures in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and adverse in-utero environments may modify the methylation levels of genomic imprinting regions, including insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)/H19, mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST), and paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10), affecting the development of the fetus. ART, maternal psychological stress, and gestational exposures to chemicals are common stressors suspected to alter global epigenetic patterns including imprinted genes. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Our objective is to highlight the effect of conception mode and maternal psychological stress on fetal development. Specifically, we monitor fetal programming, regulation of imprinted genes, fetal growth, and long-term disease risk, using the imprinted genes IGF2/H19, MEST, and PEG10 as examples. The possible role of environmental chemicals in genomic imprinting is also discussed. SEARCH METHODS: A PubMed search of articles published mostly from 2005 to 2019 was conducted using search terms IGF2/H19, MEST, PEG10, imprinted genes, DNA methylation, gene expression, and imprinting disorders (IDs). Studies focusing on maternal prenatal stress, psychological well-being, environmental chemicals, ART, and placental/fetal development were evaluated and included in this review. OUTCOMES: IGF2/H19, MEST, and PEG10 imprinted genes have a broad developmental effect on fetal growth and birth weight variation. Their disruption is linked to pregnancy complications, metabolic disorders, cognitive impairment, and cancer. Adverse early environment has a major impact on the developing fetus, affecting mostly growth, the structure, and subsequent function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and neurodevelopment. Extensive evidence suggests that the gestational environment has an impact on epigenetic patterns including imprinting, which can lead to adverse long-term outcomes in the offspring. Environmental stressors such as maternal prenatal psychological stress have been found to associate with altered DNA methylation patterns in placenta and to affect fetal development. Studies conducted during the past decades have suggested that ART pregnancies are at a higher risk for a number of complications such as birth defects and IDs. ART procedures involve multiple steps that are conducted during critical windows for imprinting establishment and maintenance, necessitating long-term evaluation of children conceived through ART. Exposure to environmental chemicals can affect placental imprinting and fetal growth both in humans and in experimental animals. Therefore, their role in imprinting should be better elucidated, considering the ubiquitous exposure to these chemicals. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Dysregulation of imprinted genes is a plausible mechanism linking stressors such as maternal psychological stress, conception using ART, and chemical exposures with fetal growth. It is expected that a greater understanding of the role of imprinted genes and their regulation in fetal development will provide insights for clinical prevention and management of growth and IDs. In a broader context, evidence connecting impaired imprinted gene function to common diseases such as cancer is increasing. This implies early regulation of imprinting may enable control of long-term human health, reducing the burden of disease in the population in years to come. © 2019 The Author(s)..

The low frequency of islet grafting is dependent on poor islet recovery from donors and early islet loss during the first hours following grafting. The reduction in islet mass during pancreas preservation, islet isolation, and islet transplantation leads to β-cell death by apoptosis and the prerecruitment of intracellular death signaling pathways, such as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), which is one of the stress groups of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).

PFAS are resistant to chemical and biological degradation and are ubiquitous in the environment, including in water, sediment, and biota in the Laurentian Great Lakes. This critical review evaluates the spatial and temporal variability of commonly studied perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) in the Great Lakes by synthesizing data collected in water, surface sediment, sediment cores, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and herring gull (Larus argentatus) eggs. The lowest PFAS concentrations in all matrices are detected in Lake Superior, which is located in the most pristine region of the Great Lakes Basin. In contrast, higher concentrations are observed in Lakes Erie and Ontario, which are more impacted by industrial activity and wastewater discharge. The distribution of individual PFAS compounds also varies across the lakes in response to changes in PFAS sources, with higher proportions of PFSAs in the eastern lakes. Sediment and biota are enriched in long chain PFSAs and PFCAs relative to concentrations in the water column, as expected based on predicted partitioning behavior. Sediment cores and bioarchives consistently demonstrate that PFAS concentrations increased in the Great Lakes from the initial time points until the early 2000s. The available data indicate that PFOS and PFOA concentrations decline after this period in the upper Great Lakes, but are stable in Lake Ontario. However, these trends depend on the lake, the individual compound, and the organism considered. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Carboxylation; Industrial chemicals; Organic chemicals; Sedimentation; Sediments; Chemical and biological degradation; Consumer applications; Industrial activities; Laurentian Great Lakes; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Spatial and temporal variability; Wastewater discharge; Lakes; alkyl group; carboxylic acid derivative; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl carboxylate; perfluoroalkyl sulfonate; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; water; carboxylic acid; fluorocarbon; biota; bird; concentration (parameter); fish; herring; lake; lake trout; Neovison vison; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; sediment; animal; Charadriiformes; chemistry; environmental monitoring; lake; metabolism; procedures; salmonine; spatiotemporal analysis; United States; water pollutant; Animals; Carboxylic Acids; Charadriiformes; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Geologic Sediments; Great Lakes Region; Lakes; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Trout; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Methods: (I) Systematic search for primary literature and systematic reviews in MEDLINE and four other databases.

To determine when uses of PFASs have an essential function in modern society, and when they do not, is not an easy task. Here, we: (1) develop the concept of ""essential use"" based on an existing approach described in the Montreal Protocol, (2) apply the concept to various uses of PFASs to determine the feasibility of elimination or substitution of PFASs in each use category, and (3) outline the challenges for phasing out uses of PFASs in society. In brief, we developed three distinct categories to describe the different levels of essentiality of individual uses. A phase-out of many uses of PFASs can be implemented because they are not necessary for the betterment of society in terms of health and safety, or because functional alternatives are currently available that can be substituted into these products or applications. Some specific uses of PFASs would be considered essential because they provide for vital functions and are currently without established alternatives. However, this essentiality should not be considered as permanent; rather, constant efforts are needed to search for alternatives. We provide a description of several ongoing uses of PFASs and discuss whether these uses are essential or non-essential according to the three essentiality categories. It is not possible to describe each use case of PFASs in detail in this single article. For follow-up work, we suggest further refining the assessment of the use cases of PFASs covered here, where necessary, and expanding the application of this concept to all other uses of PFASs.

The prevalence is increasing, especially in older cats, and hyperthyroidism is now reported worldwide as the most common feline endocrinopathy. Several studies have been performed trying to identify important etiological factors such as exposure to persistent organic pollutants, and especially brominated flame retardants, have been suggested to be of importance for the development of the disease. Recent studies have shown higher concentrations of these contaminants in serum of hyperthyroid cats in comparison to cats with normal thyroid status.

A key property in many of these applications is surface energy; specifically a low surface energy is often desired so as to impart low adhesive behavior to the materials. The fluorine–carbon bond displays low polarizability, and so fluorocarbons show high resistance to interactions with both polar and non-polar molecules. Thus the commodity fluoropolymers within the PFTE family have been used widely in applications where low adhesion and solvent resistance are important. For several decades scientists have included perfluorinated or partly-fluorinated segments into specialty polymers in attempts to achieve low fouling behavior, and modification of virtually every class of macromolecule has been explored. Notably, over the past several decades, advances in polymerization techniques, specifically controlled radical polymerization, have made possible the creation of polymers with highly-specific and unique structures, for example, block and well-defined network copolymers. Accordingly, this review discusses traditional partly-fluorinated materials but primarily focuses on recent progress in the design of partly-fluorinated polymeric materials with low surface energy. The objective of the review is to provide a concise summary of the approaches taken to date, and to demonstrate, though example, areas with high potential for innovation in the future. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adhesives; Biomaterials; Block copolymers; Interfacial energy; Polymerization; Surface segregation; Controlled radical polymerization; Fluorinated materials; Low surface energy; Modern technologies; Nonpolar molecules; Partly fluorinated polymers; Solvent resistance; Specialty polymers; Fluorine containing polymers"

In the early 1990s a PFC emulsion was approved for human use during coronary artery angioplasty and one is presently in use in Russia as well as other countries. The pharmaceutical class has had reported in the past associated with variable amounts of time-limited thrombocytopenia. Anxiety about cerebral embolism surfaced after a pivotal phase III trial leading to the cessation of all human research in the United States. At that time papers both published and submitted to the FDA opined (without proof) that the platelet count decrease might be caused by platelet white cell conjugates and/or platelet aggregates, thereby signaling a general inflammatory response to PFCs and a potential thrombosis risk. Although thrombocytopenia has been reported in response to PFC emulsion formulations, it is not ubiquitous and seems to be less associated with some formulations. As well, in some recent animal studies there is no evidence of platelet white cell adverse interactions.

Our objective was to summarize the available literature regarding its prevalence, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. Data Sources: A PubMed search was performed to include English language articles with the following search terms: pollen food syndrome, pollen food allergy syndrome, PFAS, oral allergy syndrome, OAS, food anaphylaxis, food components. Study Selections: Human articles discussing PFAS. Results: Varying reports have been made of the prevalence of PFAS, ranging from 4.7% to greater than 20% in children and 13% to 58% in adults. Prevalence varies widely by geographic region. PFAS is typically the results of class II food allergens (e.g. sensitized to anaeroallergen, but reaction occurs due to cross reactivity from a food allergen). Commonly these reactions are limited to the oropharynx due to the lability of the proteins causing the reaction. As multiple families of proteins with varying stability cause PFAS, severe systemic reactions are also possible, as anaphylactic shock has been documented in up to 1.7% of reactions. Conclusion: Pollen food allergy syndrome therefore cannot be dismissed as a benign food allergy, but it needs to be approached individually based on known risk factors. © 2019","epinephrine; immunoglobulin E; omalizumab; profilin; allergen; anaphylaxis; cross reaction; food allergy; geographic distribution; human; medical literature; nausea; pathogenesis; patient preference; physical examination; pollen allergy; pollen food allergy syndrome; prevalence; prick test; priority journal; protein degradation; quality of life; Review; subcutaneous immunotherapy; sublingual immunotherapy; symptomatology; adult; child; classification; food allergy; immunology; pathology; pollen; pollen allergy; Adult; Allergens; Child; Cross Reactions; Food Hypersensitivity; Humans; Pollen; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal"

Two of them, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are the most known and well investigated. As for many other organic substances that are of environmental concern, the diet is the main route of human exposure to PFAS. However, in certain cases drinking water may also mean a significant contribution to human exposure, and to a lesser extent, dust and air (indoor exposure). In recent years, the environmental persistence of PFAS, their biomagnification in food webs, as well as their potential accumulation and toxicity, have generated a notable interest, which has been evidenced by the considerable number of publications in this regard. Recently, we carried out a wide revision on the levels of PFAS in food and human dietary intake. In the current review, we have summarized the recent information (last 10 years) published in the scientific literature (Scopus and PubMed) on the concentrations of PFAS in drinking water and the human health risks derived from the regular water consumption, when available. A large amount of data belongs to PFOS and PFOA and corresponds to studies mainly conducted in countries of the European Union, USA and China, although no information is available for most countries over the world.

Assuring the relevance and quality of the research conducted in any research field is a crucially important task. The rapidly increasing publication rates imply that review papers will play a progressively more central role to that end. The aim of the present paper is to critically assess whether reviews dealing with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are effective vehicles for a healthy dialogue about methodological weaknesses, uncertainties, research gaps and the future direction of the field. We carried out a tiered content-analysis of CEC review papers. Relevant papers were identified through searches in Web of Science (Clarivate), leading to the identification of 6391 original research papers of which 193 are review papers. We find that the majority of CEC reviews are written as if they are comprehensive, even though this clearly is not the case. A minority (~20%) take a critical-analytical approach to the reviewing task and identify weaknesses and research gaps. The following widespread tendencies in CEC research papers are commonly noted as concerning: to equate removal of CECs to ‘decreased concentrations in the effluent’; to focus on parent substances and not concern oneself with degradation products; to focus on most commonly studied substances rather than those of most concern; to not deal with the corollary of our inability to detect or assess the risk for all substances, and to give insufficient attention to uncertainties and the unknown. Several critical-analytical reviews are among the highest cited, which suggests that they have the potential to function as effective vehicles for a healthy dialogue on these topics. On the other hand, it would appear that the concerns expressed in these reviews have a limited impact, as the same concerns are repeated over time. This might be due to a tendency among review authors to express their concerns implicitly, instead of clearly spelling them out. Our study suggests that CEC reviews presently fail to provide adequate and reliable guidance regarding the relevance and quality of research in the field. We argue that the overwhelming number of publications in combination with a lack of quality criteria for review papers are reasons to this failure: it is well documented that choices made during the reviewing process have a major impact on the outcome of a review. These choices include: search engine; the criteria used to include or exclude papers; the criteria used to assess the quality of the data generated in the research papers included; the criteria used for the choice of substances/ organisms/ technologies reported on. The lack of transparent procedures makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to assess the quality of the findings presented or to put those findings in context. In this light, it is noteworthy that criteria for a good review paper are rarely spelled out by peer-reviewed journals or included in instructions on scientific writing. The dramatic increase in publications is a challenge for the entire research community, particularly for research fields that are expected to provide policy-relevant data. We argue that only when peer-reviewed journals start specifying quality criteria for review papers, can such papers be relied upon to provide adequate and strategic guidance on the development of CEC research. We anticipate that our findings and conclusions are valid for many other research fields. © 2019 The Authors","Contamination; Degradation; Effluents; Paper; Quality control; Risk assessment; Search engines; Uncertainty analysis; CECs; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Critical analysis; Emerging contaminant; Emerging pollutants; Emerging substances; ESOCs; Quality assessment; Research quality; Review papers; Publishing; critical analysis; data quality; literature review; pollutant; research; attention; content analysis; effluent; human; human experiment; publication; quality control; review; risk assessment; search engine; spelling; systematic review; uncertainty; Web of Science; writing; literature; medical research; pollutant; publishing; Biomedical Research; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Publishing; Review Literature as Topic"

In this review, we focus on the factors determining chain lengths in fatty acid biosynthesis. In a nutshell, the process of chain-length regulation can be understood as the output of a chain-elongating C−C bond forming reaction competing with a terminating fatty acid release function. At the end of each cycle in the iterative process, the synthesizing enzymes need to “decide” whether the growing chain is to be elongated through another cycle or released as the “mature” fatty acid. Recent research has shed light on the factors determining fatty acid chain length and has also achieved control over chain length for the production of the technologically interesting short-chain (C4–C8) and medium-chain (C10–C14) fatty acids. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This trial randomized 811 individuals who were overweight or obese to one of four diets that contained either 15% or 25% protein and 20% or 40% fat in a 2 × 2 factorial design. A standard behavioral weight loss program was available for all participants who were followed for 2 years with an 80% completion rate. Recent Findings: Nineteen genes and five genetic risk scores were used along with demographic, behavioral, endocrine, and metabolic measurements. Genetic variations in most of the genes were associated with weight loss, but this association often varied with the dietary assignment. A number of demographic and behavioral factors, including attendance at behavioral sessions and food cravings were predictive of weight changes. A high baseline level of free triiodothyronine or free thyroxine predicted the magnitude of weight loss. Several perfluoroakyl compounds predicted more rapid weight regain. Summary: Genetic evidence from POUNDS Lost provides guidance toward selection of a personalized weight loss diet and improvement in metabolic profile.

Recent Findings: The evolving knowledge of mechanisms of hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis has recently been reviewed and characterized as ALD, NAFLD, and TAFLD. The most recent mechanistic studies on PFAS and PCBs have revealed a greater role for toxicants in the initiation of not only TAFLD but also NAFLD and the more progressive inflammatory stage of NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In addition to insecticides, recent studies support a significant contribution of fungicides and herbicides to NAFLD. Summary: The mechanisms of PFAS, PCBs, and fungicides in contributing to the increased prevalence of NAFLD remain unclear. Addressing whether chronic, low-dose exposures could result in liver pathology and whether real-world exposure to mixtures of environmental contaminants pose a significant risk factor for NAFLD is paramount to understand the impact of NAFLD on populations today. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","pesticide; disease exacerbation; drug effect; human; liver; nonalcoholic fatty liver; pollutant; prevalence; risk factor; toxicity; Disease Progression; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Liver; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Pesticides; Prevalence; Risk Factors"

Due to the inefficient treatment technologies, conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are unable to remove many antibiotics from wastewater. This review encapsulates the current status of antibiotics occurrence in influent and effluent of WWTPs globally. Specifically, β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, sulfonamides, tetracyclines classes of antibiotics are found to be high in wastewater. An overview of physicochemical properties, generation classifications of antibiotics, and different advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) available for the removal of emerging pollutants are presented. Besides, the removal efficiency of diverse antibiotics by various AOPs are discussed. The combination such as UV/H2O2, UV/H2O2/Fe2+ and ozonation are reported for maximum removal of antibiotics. However, when compared to simulated wastewater, limitations are persisted for the removal of antibiotics in real wastewater, owing to its difficulty in assessing and observing the compound under mixed nature.

Peroxydisulfate (PDS) is widely used as oxidant in soil remediation due to its low cost and long environmental retention time. Experimental parameters and some soil properties significantly impact the contaminant removal rate. Changes in soil geochemistry, biology, and contaminant dynamics occur after application of this technology. The degradation rate of contaminants in soil is generally characterized by a pseudo-first-order reaction kinetic model.

Growing evidence from animal and human studies indicates that distinct time periods of heightened susceptibility to endocrine disruptors exist throughout the life course. The influence of environmental chemicals on breast cancer risk may be greater during several windows of susceptibility (WOS) in a woman's life, including prenatal development, puberty, pregnancy, and the menopausal transition. These time windows are considered as specific periods of susceptibility for breast cancer because significant structural and functional changes occur in the mammary gland, as well as alterations in the mammary micro-environment and hormone signaling that may influence risk. Breast cancer research focused on these breast cancer WOS will accelerate understanding of disease etiology and prevention. Main text: Despite the plausible heightened mechanistic influences of environmental chemicals on breast cancer risk during time periods of change in the mammary gland's structure and function, most human studies of environmental chemicals are not focused on specific WOS. This article reviews studies conducted over the past few decades that have specifically addressed the effect of environmental chemicals and metals on breast cancer risk during at least one of these WOS. In addition to summarizing the broader evidence-base specific to WOS, we include discussion of the NIH-funded Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Program (BCERP) which included population-based and basic science research focused on specific WOS to evaluate associations between breast cancer risk and particular classes of endocrine-disrupting chemicals - including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, perfluorinated compounds, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and phenols - and metals. We outline ways in which ongoing transdisciplinary BCERP projects incorporate animal research and human epidemiologic studies in close partnership with community organizations and communication scientists to identify research priorities and effectively translate evidence-based findings to the public and policy makers. Conclusions: An integrative model of breast cancer research is needed to determine the impact and mechanisms of action of endocrine disruptors at different WOS. By focusing on environmental chemical exposure during specific WOS, scientists and their community partners may identify when prevention efforts are likely to be most effective. © 2019 The Author(s).","metal; perfluoro compound; phenol derivative; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; birth weight; breast cancer; cancer growth; cancer prevention; cancer risk; cancer susceptibility; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; environmental exposure; health care policy; human; mammography; medical research; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; optical spectroscopy; postmenopause; pregnancy; prenatal period; Review; self report; sex differentiation; adverse event; animal; breast tumor; disease predisposition; environmental exposure; female; maternal exposure; menopause; puberty; research; risk factor; time factor; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Disease Susceptibility; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Menopause; Pregnancy; Puberty; Research; Risk Factors; Time Factors"

Basic principles, general limitations and advantages, as well as main areas of application in drug discovery, are overviewed for some of the most popular ligand binding assays. The authors further provide a guide to affinity predictions, collectively covering several techniques that are used in the first stages of rational drug design. Expert opinion: All affinity estimation methods have limitations and advantages that partially overlap and complement one another.

Hence, textile treatments for water or oil repellency should be non-toxic, biocompatible, and comply with stringent health standards. Moreover, considering the volume of the worldwide textile industry, these treatments should be scalable, sustainable, and eco-friendly. Due to this awareness, more and more non-wettable textile treatments with eco-friendly processes and green or non-toxic chemicals are being adopted and reported. Although fluorinated alkylsilanes or fluorinated polymers with C8 chemistry (with ≥ 8 fluorinated carbon atoms) are the best performing materials to render textiles water or oil repellent, they pose substantial health and environmental problems and are being banned. For this reason, water/solvent-borne, C8-free vehicles for non-wettable treatment formulations are probably the only ones that can have commercialization prospects. Hence, researchers have come up with a variety of new, non-toxic, green formulations and materials to render fabrics liquid repellent that constitute the focus of this review paper. As such, this review article discusses and summarizes recent developments and techniques on various sustainable superhydrophobic treatments for textiles, with comparable performance and durability to formulations based on fluorinated C8 compounds. The current state-of-the-art technologies, potential commercialization prospects, and relevant limitations are discussed and summarized with examples. The review also attempts to indicate promising future strategies and new materials that can transform the process for non-wettable textiles into an all-sustainable technology. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biocompatibility; Contact angle; Environmental protection; Hydrophobicity; Petroleum prospecting; Silicones; Sustainable development; Textile industry; Textiles; Toxic materials; Environmentally benign; Fluorinated; Hydrophobic; Oleophobic; Sliding angle; State-of-the-art technology; Superhydrophobic materials; Sustainable technology; Fabrics"

Syngas-to-aromatics (STA) is a very promising approach for the synthesis of aromatic monomers, and is catalyzed via bifunctional catalysts in a single reactor, wherein methanol/dimethyl ether and/or olefins intermediates formed from syngas on metal components are converted into aromatic monomers exclusively on the HZSM-5 by cascade reactions. Since an optimal Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) temperature of Fe-based catalysts is very close to an aromatization temperature of HZSM-5, Fe-based catalysts have been frequently used/modified for the synthesis of aromatic monomers from hydrogenation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2). The nature of metal components and amounts of Brönsted acid sites on HZSM-5, and their mesoporosity and intimacy, significantly alter the selectivity for aromatics by tuning BTX distibution and catalyst stability. Although many developments have been achieved regarding the STA process in recent years, no reviews have been published in this flourishing research area over the last two decades.

This has led to the gradual phase-out from production and commerce of some legacy PFAS. Fluoroalkylether compounds (ether-PFAS) are among the fluorinated alternative chemicals that are beginning to be reported in impacted and background environments. Extensive monitoring activities were conducted since 2015–2019 to bridge knowledge gaps on the environmental fate and effects of ether-PFAS including F-53B (6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate [6:2 Cl-PFAES] and 8:2 Cl-PFAES), Gen-X (hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid [HFPO-DA]), and ADONA (dodecafluoro-3H-4,8-dioxanonanoate). In recent years, advances in nontarget screening using high-resolution mass spectrometry have revealed the identities of other infrequently monitored ether-PFAS. In this critical review, we provide an up-to-date inventory of the structures of ether-PFAS discovered in the recent literature. Their environmental occurrence, fate, and effects are discussed on a comparative perspective with some legacy PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). Information on the methods employed for the quantitative and semi-quantitative analysis of ether-PFAS is also provided, including sample preparation and mass spectrometry analysis, analytical performance, and limitations.

Furthermore, HTC offers several advantages over conventional dry-thermal pre-treatments, as no prior drying is requested, and the high quality of the char produced promotes applications as energy production and storage, wastewater remediation, and soil amendment. Relationships between char yields, physicochemical properties and process parameters are here analysed, with the aim to provide insight into the choice of the process severity required to fit the desired application. Moreover, presence and fate of heavy metals and organic contaminants are discussed. The highest reaction temperature is the main parameter affecting the physicochemical characteristics of the char produced, while the heating rate governs the heat mass transfer and the rate of intermediates formation. Depolymerization of the biomass results in a reduction of the oxygen to carbon ratio and, therefore, in augmented high heating values, further increased by deposition of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural. Recirculation of process water may enhance dehydration reactions and the deposition of degraded polymers, increasing dewaterability and yield, but field trials are recommended to assess the feasibility of this option. An overuse of chars for energy generation purposes would be deleterious for the environmental life cycle.

Cephalosporins are the broad-spectrum antibiotics of β-lactam family. Owing to its enormous production and consumption, it is reported as the second most prescribed antibiotic classes in Europe. The cephalosporin wastewater contains toxic organic compounds, inorganic salts, and active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) which pose a potential threat to the organisms in the environment. Therefore, removal of cephalosporin antibiotics from the environment has become mandatory as it contributes to increase in the level of chemical oxygen demand (COD), causing toxicity of the effluent and production of cephalosporin-resistant microbes. So far, several processes have been reported for degradation/removal of cephalosporins from the environment. A number of individual studies have been published within the last decade covering the various aspects of antibiotics. However, a detailed compilation on cephalosporin antibiotics as an emerging environmental contaminant is still lacking. Hence, the present review intends to highlight the current ecological scenario with respect to distribution, toxicity, degradation, various remediation technologies, and the regulatory aspects concerning cephalosporins. The latest successful technologies for cephalosporin degradation/removal discussed in this review will help researchers for a better understanding of the nature and persistence of cephalosporins in the environment along with the risks associated with their existence.

The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of current exposure, fate, and potential health effects of contaminants in polar bears from the circumpolar Arctic required by the Circumpolar Action Plan for polar bear conservation. Overall results suggest that legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) including polychlorinated biphenyls, chlordanes and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), followed by other perfluoroalkyl compounds (e.g. carboxylic acids, PFCAs) and brominated flame retardants, are still the main compounds in polar bears. Concentrations of several legacy POPs that have been banned for decades in most parts of the world have generally declined in polar bears. Current spatial trends of contaminants vary widely between compounds and recent studies suggest increased concentrations of both POPs and PFCAs in certain subpopulations.

In this paper, we argue that the higher the persistence of a chemical, the greater the emphasis that it should be given in chemicals assessment and decision making. We provide case studies for three classes of highly persistent chemicals (chlorofluorocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) to exemplify problems unique to highly persistent chemicals, despite their otherwise diverse properties. Many well-known historical chemical pollution problems were the result of the release of highly persistent chemicals. Using evaluative modeling calculations, we demonstrate that if a chemical is highly persistent, its continuous release will lead to continuously increasing contamination irrespective of the chemical's physical-chemical properties. We argue that these increasing concentrations will result in increasing probabilities of the occurrence of known and unknown effects and that, once adverse effects are identified, it will take decades, centuries or even longer to reverse contamination and therefore effects. Based on our findings we propose that high persistence alone should be established as a sufficient basis for regulation of a chemical, which we term the ""P-sufficient approach"". We argue that regulation on high persistence alone is not over-precautionary given the historical and ongoing problems that persistent chemicals have caused. Regulation of highly persistent chemicals, for example by restriction of emissions, would not only be precautionary, but would serve to prevent poorly reversible future impacts. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Decision making; Indicators (chemical); Chemical pollution; Chemical regulation; Diverse properties; Environmental science; Model calculations; Persistent chemicals; Physical chemical property; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Chemical hazards; environmental chemical; chlorofluorocarbon; polychlorinated biphenyl; calculation; contamination; decision making; mass; pollution; priority journal; probability; regulatory mechanism; Review; analysis; dangerous goods; ecosystem restoration; human; pollution; theoretical model; Chlorofluorocarbons; Environmental Pollution; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Hazardous Substances; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Polychlorinated Biphenyls"

Although overexploitation and habitat degradation are the two biggest threats to batoid populations, coastal and oceanic pollution is also a pervasive potential threat. In this systematic review, we compile published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea superorder and present contamination patterns, exposure effects, and potential human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found batoids to accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Accumulation of POPs is reported for chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Hg levels in muscle tissue were significantly different among oceanic basins and habitats, consistent with previous global assessments of Hg oceanic background levels. Some batoid species presented Hg levels higher than large pelagic teleost fishes and comparable to sharks. Ecological traits such as, bottom feeding, upper trophic position and elasmobranch-specific physiology and metabolism are discussed as potential factors associated with Hg uptake and accumulation in batoids. Some species exceeded USEPA's maximum contamination safety limits in edible tissues for Hg, As and ΣPCBs. For most trace metals and POPs, there is a lack of studies focusing on contamination levels in batoids. We recommend future research increasing reporting on POPs and trace metals besides Hg in batoids to further investigate the role of Elasmobranch as a bioindicator for marine pollution. © 2019 Elsevier LtdWe surveyed literature on 65 batoids species and found a large range of reported inorganic and organic contaminants at levels below food safety limits, except for Hg, As and PCB. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical contamination; Contamination; Ecosystems; Insecticides; Marine pollution; Mercury (metal); Metals; Pollution; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Tissue; Trace elements; Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane; Elasmobranch; Inorganic contaminants; Organochlorines; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Persistent organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB); Organic pollutants; alkyl group; arsenic acid; bismuth; cadmium; chlordane; chlorphenotane; chromium; cobalt; copper; dieldrin; heptachlor epoxide; hexachlorobenzene; iron; lead; manganese; mercury; nickel; palladium; perfluoro compound; platinum; polychlorinated biphenyl; rhodium; rubidium; selenium; strontium; tin; trace metal; unindexed drug; vanadium; zinc; chlorinated hydrocarbon; environmental marker; heavy metal; trace element; bioindicator; chemical pollutant; literature review; marine pollution; mercury (element); organochlorine; persistent organic pollutant; pollution exposure; shark; teleost; trace metal; bioaccumulation; cartilaginous fish; concentration (parameter); egg; egg yolk; environmental exposure; fin (organ); foraging; geographical variation (species); gill; health hazard; intestine tissue; kidney tissue; liver tissue; muscle; nonhuman; ovum; persistent organic pollutant; pollution transport; population exposure; Review; systematic review; tissue level; water contamination; analysis; animal; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; human; metabolism; procedures; skate (fish); water pollutant; Batoidea; Chondrichthyes; Dasyatidae; Rhinobatidae; Teleostei; Animals; Ecosystem; Environmental Biomarkers; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Metals, Heavy; Skates (Fish); Trace Elements; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

This paper gives a comprehensive review of available human PBTK models for compounds selected as a priority by the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU). We highlight their advantages and deficiencies and suggest steps for advanced internal dose modelling. The review of the available PBTK models highlighted the conceptual differences between older models compared to the ones developed recently, reflecting commensurate differences in research questions. Due to the lack of coordinated strategies for deriving useful biomonitoring data for toxicokinetic properties, significant problems in model parameterisation still remain; these are further increased by the lack of human toxicokinetic data due to ethics issues. Finally, questions arise as well as to the extent they are really representative of interindividual variability. QSARs for toxicokinetic properties is a complementary approach for PBTK model parameterisation, especially for data poor chemicals. This approach could be expanded to model chemico-biological interactions such as intestinal absorption and renal clearance; this could serve the development of more complex generic PBTK models that could be applied to newly derived chemicals. Another gap identified is the framework for mixture interaction terms among compounds that could eventually interact in metabolism. From the review it was concluded that efforts should be shifted toward the development of generic multi-compartmental and multi-route models, supported by targeted biomonitoring coupled with parameterisation by both QSAR approach and experimental (in-vivo and in-vitro) data for newly developed and data poor compounds. © 2019","aniline; bromine derivative; cadmium; chlorpyrifos; chromium derivative; flame retardant; perfluoro compound; phenol derivative; phthalic acid; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; absorption; biomonitoring; developmental biology; dose-response relationship; metabolism; modeling; physiology; toxicology; biological monitoring; experimental model; intestine absorption; metabolism; physiologically based pharmacokinetic model; priority journal; quantitative structure activity relation; renal clearance; Review; toxicokinetics; biological model; biological monitoring; human; Biological Monitoring; Humans; Models, Biological; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Toxicokinetics"

Early generations of biofuels, such as ethanol, butanol, and straight-chain fatty acid-derived esters or hydrocarbons suffer from various undesirable properties and can only be blended in limited amounts. Recent research has shifted to the production of branched-chain biofuels that, compared to straight-chain fuels, have higher octane values, better cold flow, and lower cloud points, making them more suitable for existing engines, particularly for diesel and jet engines.

It is suitable for various climate conditions due to its low boiling point (-64 °C). Therefore, it has been widely used in power grid equipment. However, its global warming potential (GWP) is 23,500 times higher than that of CO2. Thus, it is imperative to find an environmentally friendly insulating gas with excellent insulation performance, lower GWP, and which is harmless to equipment and workers to replace SF6. In this review, four possible alternatives, including perfluorocarbons, trifluoroiodomethane, perfluorinated ketones, and fluoronitrile are reviewed in terms of basic physicochemical properties, insulation properties, decomposition properties, and compatibility with metals. The influences of trace H2O or O2 on their insulation performances are also discussed. The insulation strengths of these insulating gases were comparable to or higher than that of SF6. The GWPs of these insulating gases were lower than that of SF6. Due to their relatively high boiling point, they should be used as a mixture with buffering gases with low boiling points.

While, PFCs are present in soil, water, and air, their pathway for entry into the human body is circumstantially via contaminated food. The demand for seafood has been increasing. In this study, we investigated via LC-MS/MS, the content of 19 different types of PFCs in 302 samples belonging to five different categories of the typical South Korean seafood. The highest levels of PFOA, PFTrDA, PFOS, and PFPeA were found in dried seafood, canned and salted seafood, processed fish food, and seasoned laver, respectively. The levels of PFOA and PFOS were compared on the basis of various criteria including the nomenclature, biological classification, and habitat of the source of seafood. High levels of PFOA and PFOS were detected in anchovy, sea squirt, and mackerel based on the nomenclature of raw seafood, in crustaceans based on the biological classification, and in demersal organisms based on the habitat. The human intake values of PFOA and PFOS from the processed marine products in South Korea were lower than the tolerable daily intake, indicating that the consumption of these processed seafood poses no immediate harm. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoropentanoic acid; perfluorotridecanoic acid; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; anchovy; Ascidiacea; canned food; concentration (parameter); controlled study; Crustacea; demersal fish; food analysis; food industry; food intake; food quality; habitat; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; nomenclature; nonhuman; raw food; Review; sea food; South Korean; analysis; animal; chemistry; food contamination; human; liquid chromatography; sea food; South Korea; tandem mass spectrometry; Animals; Chromatography, Liquid; Fluorocarbons; Food Contamination; Humans; Republic of Korea; Seafood; Tandem Mass Spectrometry"

Its long half-life in humans, indefinite persistence in the environment, and awareness of its widespread presence in drinking water make the human health assessment of PFOS a priority. While developmental, endocrine, and hepatic effects, and increased serum cholesterol are among the outcomes resulting from PFOS exposure, immunosuppression has also consistently emerged as an adverse effect. An in-depth review of the relevant scientific literature on the toxicology of PFOS has identified immunosuppression as a sensitive endpoint for PFOS toxicity. Here, we focus specifically on that endpoint and provide a detailed derivation of a Reference Dose (RfD) of 1.8 × 10−6 mg/kg/day for chronic human exposure to PFOS. This RfD is based on decreased plaque-forming cell (PFC) response in mice, an endpoint that reflects suppression of the immune response to a foreign antigen. We additionally identify two endpoints in the epidemiology literature, decreased vaccine response and increased incidence of childhood infections, that are associated with PFOS exposure and that are consistent with and support the decreased PFC response endpoint from animal studies. We provide a weight of evidence analysis integrating the evidence from animal and epidemiology endpoints. Finally, we compare this RfD to the PFOS RfD derived by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Office of Water based on a developmental endpoint. Based on this comparison, and given our assessment, the USEPA RfD does not provide sufficient protection against the adverse health effects of PFOS. The RfD derived herein is intended to be public health protective and appropriately minimizes PFOS exposure based on available evidence. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","drinking water; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; cell; chemical compound; developmental biology; dose-response relationship; ecotoxicology; epidemiology; health monitoring; immune response; pollution exposure; public health; risk assessment; analytical parameters; cholesterol blood level; dose; immune response; immunosuppressive treatment; immunotoxicity; infection; nonhuman; plaque forming cell; priority journal; reference dose; Review; animal; child; environmental exposure; human; mouse; United States; Animalia; Mus; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Child; Environmental Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Mice"

A variety of synthetic approaches has been employed in late-stage difluoroalkylation reactions. Visible light photoredox catalysis for the production of CF 2 FG and CF 2 H radicals has provided a more sustainable alternative to other conventional radical-triggered reactions from the viewpoint of safety, cost, availability, and “green” chemistry. A wide range of difluoroalkylating reagents has been successfully implemented in these organic transformations in the presence of transition metal complexes or organic photocatalysts. In most cases, upon excitation via visible light irradiation with fluorescent light bulbs or blue light-emitting diode (LED) lamps, these photocatalysts can act as both reductive and oxidative quenchers, thus enabling the application of electron-donor or electron-acceptor difluoroalkylating reagents for the generation of CF 2 FG and CF 2 H radicals. Subsequent radical addition to substrates and additional organic transformations afford the corresponding difluoroalkylated derivatives.

Despite that, there is a clear lack of assays to identify TH disruptors. Recently zebrafish embryos were suggested as screening tool to identify compounds which impact thyroid synthesis. Effects on hormone level, gene transcript expression, eye development and swim bladder inflation are suggested as potential biomarker for TH disruptors. In order to assess the applicability of these biomarkers we performed a literature review. The effects of 25 known TH disrupting compounds were compared between studies. The studies were limited to exposures with embryos prior 7 days of development. The different study designs and the lack of standardized methods complicated the comparison of the results. The most common responses were morphological alterations and gene transcript expression changes, but no specific biomarker for TH disruption could be identified. In studies addressing TH disruption behavioral effects were more commonly monitored than in studies not mentioning the TH pathway. TH disruption in developing zebrafish embryos might be caused by different modes of action e.g. disruption of follicle development, binding of TH, activation of TH receptors causing different effects. Timing of developmental processes in combination with exposure duration might also play a role. On the other side compound characteristics (uptake, stability, metabolization) could also cause differences between substances.

Prenylated flavonoids are one of the constituents of Sophora species that play important roles in their biological properties.

Prenylated flavonoids have a more lipophilic structure, which leads to its high affinity to the cell membranes and enhancement of the biological activity, which includes cytotoxicity, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and estrogenic activities. However, it is reported that prenylation decreases the plasma absorption but increases the tissue accumulation. The presence of the prenyl or lavandulyl groups on C8 position of flavonoids plays an important role in the biological activity.

More than 4000 PFASs have been manufactured by humans and hundreds have been detected in environmental samples. Direct exposures due to use in products can be quickly phased out by shifts in chemical production but exposures driven by PFAS accumulation in the ocean and marine food chains and contamination of groundwater persist over long timescales. Serum concentrations of legacy PFASs in humans are declining globally but total exposures to newer PFASs and precursor compounds have not been well characterized. Human exposures to legacy PFASs from seafood and drinking water are stable or increasing in many regions, suggesting observed declines reflect phase-outs in legacy PFAS use in consumer products. Many regions globally are continuing to discover PFAS contaminated sites from aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) use, particularly next to airports and military bases. Exposures from food packaging and indoor environments are uncertain due to a rapidly changing chemical landscape where legacy PFASs have been replaced by diverse precursors and custom molecules that are difficult to detect. Multiple studies find significant associations between PFAS exposure and adverse immune outcomes in children. Dyslipidemia is the strongest metabolic outcome associated with PFAS exposure. Evidence for cancer is limited to manufacturing locations with extremely high exposures and insufficient data are available to characterize impacts of PFAS exposures on neurodevelopment. Preliminary evidence suggests significant health effects associated with exposures to emerging PFASs.

Paired sampling refers to the simultaneous sampling of CSF and blood and by comparing metal concentrations between CSF and blood conclusions about exposure and barrier properties can be drawn. However previous reports on metal concentrations in body fluids in neurodegenerative disorders show a wide variation in results hampering firm conclusions on the role of metals in degeneration of nerve cells.

Progress in rice cultivars with improved tolerance has been hampered by a poor understanding of Fe availability in the soil, the transportation mechanism, and associated genetic factors for the tolerance of Fe toxicity soil (FTS) or Fe deficiency soil (FDS) conditions. In the past, through conventional breeding approaches, rice varieties were developed especially suitable for low- and high-pH soils, which indirectly helped the varieties to tolerate FTS and FDS conditions. Rice-Fe interactions in the external environment of soil, internal homeostasis, and transportation have been studied extensively in the past few decades. However, the molecular and physiological mechanisms of Fe uptake and transport need to be characterized in response to the tolerance of morpho-physiological traits under Fe-toxic and -deficient soil conditions, and these traits need to be well integrated into breeding programs. A deeper understanding of the several factors that influence Fe absorption, uptake, and transport from soil to root and above-ground organs under FDS and FTS is needed to develop tolerant rice cultivars with improved grain yield. Therefore, the objective of this review paper is to congregate the different phenotypic screening methodologies for prospecting tolerant rice varieties and their responsible genetic traits, and Fe homeostasis related to all the known quantitative trait loci (QTLs), genes, and transporters, which could offer enormous information to rice breeders and biotechnologists to develop rice cultivars tolerant of Fe toxicity or deficiency. The mechanism of Fe regulation and transport from soil to grain needs to be understood in a systematic manner along with the cascade of metabolomics steps that are involved in the development of rice varieties tolerant of FTS and FDS.

In this review, the compatibilization of ceramic molecular sieves with perfluorinated matrices is considered first, examining the effect of the surface treatment on the gas transport properties of the filler. Then the preparation of the defect-free hybrid membranes and their gas separation capabilities are described. Finally, recent modelling of the gas transport properties of the perfluoropolymer MMMs is reviewed. The systematic use of molecular sieves of different size and shape, either permeable or impermeable, and the calculation of the bulk transport properties of the molecular sieves-i.e., the unrestricted diffusion and permeability-allow to understand the nature of the physical phenomena at work in the MMMs, that is the larger the perfluoropolymer fractional free volume at the interface, and restricted diffusion at the molecular sieves. This knowledge led to the formulation of a new four-phase approach for the modelling of gas transport. The four-phase approach was implemented in the frame of the Maxwell model and also for the finite element simulation. The four-phase approach is a convenient representation of the transport in MMMs when more than one single interfacial effect is present. © 2019 by the authors.

The objective of our study was to estimate the relationship between dental caries prevalence and exposure to four PFAA: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) in a nationally representative sample of US adolescents. Setting/Design We analysed cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2012 for 12-19-year-old US adolescents. Participants Of 10 856 adolescents aged 12 to 19 years who had a dental examination, we included 2869 with laboratory measurements for serum PFAA concentrations and complete covariate data in our study. Primary and secondary outcome measures Dental caries prevalence was defined as the presence of decay or a restoration on any tooth surface, or the loss of a tooth due to tooth decay. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the covariate-Adjusted association between serum PFAA concentrations and dental caries prevalence, accounting for the complex National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey design. Results Of 2869 adolescents, 59% had one or more dental caries. We observed no associations between the prevalence of dental caries and serum concentrations of PFOA, PFOS or PFHxS. The adjusted odds of caries were 21% (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.01), 15% (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.08) and 30% (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.90) lower among adolescents in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th serum PFNA concentration quartiles compared to adolescents in the first quartile, respectively. The linear trend for this association was not statistically significant. Conclusion PFOA, PFOS and PFHxS were not associated with prevalence of dental caries. The prevalence of caries was reduced with increasing serum PFNA concentrations; however, these results should be interpreted cautiously given that we were unable to adjust for several factors related to oral health. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.","alkyl group; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; cotinine; fluorocarbon; lead; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; sulfonic acid derivative; adolescent; adult; biological activity; child; comparative study; cross-sectional study; dental caries; dental restoration; female; human; laboratory test; major clinical study; male; multivariate logistic regression analysis; prevalence; Review; school child; surface property; trend study; United States; young adult; African American; blood; Caucasian; dental caries; educational status; environmental exposure; Hispanic; income; Mexican American; nutrition; sex ratio; Adolescent; African Americans; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Child; Cotinine; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dental Caries; Educational Status; Environmental Exposure; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Fluorocarbons; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Income; Lead; Male; Mexican Americans; Nutrition Surveys; Prevalence; Sex Distribution; Sulfonic Acids; United States; Young Adult"

These include establishing the pathological nature of bleeding, and the uncertainties surrounding the clinical relevance of laboratory results. Furthermore, the high frequency of bleeding symptoms in the normal population and the subjective appraisal of symptoms by patients or parents makes elucidating the pathological nature of bleeding difficult. Standardized bleeding assessment tools and semiquantitative bleeding scores (BSs) help to discriminate normal from abnormal bleeding. However, as most MBDs have similar bleeding patterns, for example, bleeding sites, frequency, and severity, BSs are of little help for diagnosing specific diseases. Global tests of primary hemostasis (bleeding time; PFA-100/200) lack sensitivity and, like BSs, are not disease-specific. Problems with the diagnosis of type 1 VWD and PFD include assay standardization, uncertain definition of von Willebrand factor cut-off levels, and the lack of universal diagnostic criteria for PFD. Regarding clotting factor deficiencies, the bleeding thresholds of some coagulation factors, such as factor VII and FXI, are highly variable, and may lead to misinterpretation of the clinical relevance of mild to moderate deficiencies. Remarkably, a large proportion of MBDs remain undiagnosed even after comprehensive and repeated laboratory testing. These are tentatively considered to represent bleeding of undefined cause, with clinical features indistinguishable from those of classical MBD; the pathogenesis of this is probably multifactorial, and unveiling these mechanisms should constitute a fertile source of translational research. © 2018 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis","blood clotting factor; von Willebrand factor; bleeding disorder; bleeding time; blood clotting factor deficiency; hemostasis; human; laboratory diagnosis; laboratory test; mild bleeding disorder; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; sensitivity and specificity; thrombocyte dysfunction; von Willebrand disease; animal; blood; blood clotting; blood clotting disorder; blood clotting parameters; blood clotting test; differential diagnosis; genetic predisposition; genetics; phenotype; predictive value; reproducibility; thrombocyte disorder; von Willebrand disease; Animals; Blood Coagulation; Blood Coagulation Disorders, Inherited; Blood Coagulation Tests; Blood Platelet Disorders; Diagnosis, Differential; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Phenotype; Platelet Function Tests; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; von Willebrand Disease, Type 1"

Given this threat to living organisms, we carried out a broad review of possible sources of PFASs and their potential accumulation in agricultural plants, from where they can transfer to humans through the food chain. Analysis of the literature indicates a direct correlation between PFAS concentrations in soil and bioaccumulation in plants. Furthermore, plant uptake largely changes with chain length, functional group, plant species and organ. Low accumulations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) have been found in peeled potatoes and cereal seeds, while short-chain compounds can accumulate at high levels in leafy vegetables and fruits. Significant variations in PFAS buildup in plants according to soil amendment are also found, suggesting a particular interaction with soil organic matter.

Reclaiming and reusing the solvents may be the most economically and environmentally beneficial option for managing spent solvents. Purifying the solvents to meet reuse specifications can be challenging. For hydrophilic solvents, water must be removed prior to reuse, yet many hydrophilic solvents form hard-to-separate azeotropic mixtures with water. Such mixtures make separation processes energy-intensive and cause economic challenges. The membrane processes pervaporation (PV) and vapor permeation (VP) can be less energy-intensive than distillation-based processes and have proven to be very effective in removing water from azeotropic mixtures. In PV/VP, separation is based on the solution–diffusion interaction between the dense permselective layer of the membrane and the solvent/water mixture. This review provides a state-of-the-science analysis of materials used as the selective layer(s) of PV/VP membranes in removing water from organic solvents. A variety of membrane materials, such as polymeric, inorganic, mixed matrix, and hybrid, have been reported in the literature. A small subset of these is commercially available and highlighted here: poly (vinyl alcohol), polyimides, amorphous perfluoro polymers, NaA zeolites, chabazite zeolites, T-type zeolites, and hybrid silicas. The typical performance characteristics and operating limits of these membranes are discussed. Solvents targeted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for reclamation are emphasized and ten common solvents are chosen for analysis: acetonitrile, 1-butanol, N,N-dimethyl formamide, ethanol, methanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, and 2-propanol.

Not only is oxygen the driving force for many cellular functions and metabolism, but it is also involved in regulating stem cell fate, morphogenesis, and organogenesis. Low oxygen levels are the naturally preferred microenvironment for most processes during early development and mainly drive proliferation. Later on, more oxygen and also nutrients are needed for organogenesis and morphogenesis. Therefore, it is critical to maintain oxygen levels within a narrow range as required during development. Modulating oxygen tensions is performed via oxygen homeostasis mainly through the function of hypoxia-inducible factors. Through the function of these factors, oxygen levels are sensed and regulated in different tissues, starting from their embryonic state to adult development. To be able to mimic this process in a tissue engineering setting, it is important to understand the role and levels of oxygen in each developmental stage, from embryonic stem cell differentiation to organogenesis and morphogenesis. Taking lessons from native tissue microenvironments, researchers have explored approaches to control oxygen tensions such as hemoglobin-based, perfluorocarbon-based, and oxygen-generating biomaterials, within synthetic tissue engineering scaffolds and organoids, with the aim of overcoming insufficient or nonuniform oxygen levels and nutrient supply. © 2018 © 2018 S.

Inert fluorinated gases are nontoxic, abundant, relatively inexpensive, and the technique can be performed on any MRI scanner with broadband multinuclear imaging capabilities. Pulmonary 19F MRI has been performed in animals, healthy human volunteers, and in patients with lung disease. In this review, the technical requirements of 19F MRI are discussed, along with various imaging approaches used to optimize the image quality. Lung imaging is typically performed in humans using a gas mixture containing 79% perfluoropropane (PFP) or sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and 21% oxygen. In lung diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF), ventilation defects are apparent in regions that the inhaled gas cannot access. 19F lung images are typically acquired in a single breath-hold, or in a time-resolved, multiple breath fashion. The former provides measurements of the ventilation defect percent (VDP), while the latter provides measurements of gas replacement (ie, fractional ventilation). Finally, preliminary comparisons with other functional lung imaging techniques are discussed, such as Fourier decomposition MRI and hyperpolarized gas MRI. Overall, functional 19F lung MRI is expected to complement existing proton-based structural imaging techniques, and the combination of structural and functional lung MRI will provide useful outcome measures in the future management of pulmonary diseases in the clinic.

Fosfomycin is known for its robust bactericidal effect against ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and CRE. However, fosfomycin-modified genes have been reported in transposon elements and conjugative plasmids, resulting in fosfomycin resistance in parts of East Asia. Here we review reports of fosfomycin-modified (fos) genes in Enterobacteriaceae and assess the efficacy of fosfomycin against multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections. At least 10 kinds of fos genes have been identified in the past decade; of these, fosA (and fosA subtypes) and fosC2 are primarily found in Enterobacteriaceae. All fosA subtypes except fosA2 are found in plasmids and transposons, nearby insertion sequence elements, or integrons, indicating that mobilizing elements also play an important role in plasmid-mediated fos genes in Enterobacteriaceae. fosA3, which is prevalent in East Asia, has been transmitted (mostly by animals) within and across continents via IS26 mobile elements. The acquisition of multiple antibiotic resistance genes via plasmids and mobile elements has resulted in a need for combined treatments for Enterobacteriaceae cases.

Using an on-line questionnaire we asked the first authors of the most relevant publications to retrospectively assess 4) the use of their typologies in education, science and forest policy. Most of the 66 publications reviewed share the common objective of providing a better understanding of forest ownership. Typologies were also developed to address roundwood mobilization, delivery of public goods, forest management approaches, involvement in PFO associations and entrepreneurship. The most common methodological approach was quantitative where owners were grouped by k-means clustering into 2 to 6 types and labelled with various names. Most frequently used labels were Multiobjective owners, Recreationists, Investors, Farmers, Indifferent owners, Conservationists, Multifunctional owners and Self-employed owners. Policy implications remain vague. The typologies had mostly been used in teaching and occasionally by politicians, civil servants or stakeholders.

Utilizing photonic advantage for astronomical spectroscopy is a promising approach to miniaturizing the next generation of spectrometers for large telescopes. It can be primarily attained by leveraging the two-dimensional nature of photonic structures on a chip or a set of fibers, thus reducing the size of spectroscopic instrumentation to a few centimeters and the weight to a few hundred grams. A wide variety of astrophotonic spectrometers is currently being developed, including arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs), photonic echelle gratings (PEGs), and Fourier-transform spectrometer (FTS). These astrophotonic devices are flexible, cheaper to mass produce, easier to control, and much less susceptible to vibrations and flexure than conventional astronomical spectrographs.

EDs mimic naturally occurring hormones like estrogens and androgens which can in turn interfere with the endocrine system. As a consequence, EDs affect human reproduction as well as post and pre-natal development. In fact, infants can be affected already at prenatal level due to maternal exposure to EDs. In particular, great attention has been given to those chemicals, or their metabolites, that have estrogenic properties or antagonistic effects on the activity of androgen or even inhibiting their production. These compounds have therefore the potential of interfering with important physiological processes, such as masculinization, morphological development of the urogenital system and secondary sexual traits. Animal and in vitro studies have supported the conclusion that endocrine-disrupting chemicals affect the hormone-dependent pathways responsible for male gonadal development, either through direct interaction with hormone receptors or via epigenetic and cell-cycle regulatory modes of action. In human populations, epidemiological studies have reported an overall decline of male fertility and an increased incidence of diseases or congenital malformations of the male reproductive system. The majority of studies point towards an association between exposure to EDs and male and/or female reproductive system disorders, such as infertility, endometriosis, breast cancer, testicular cancer, poor sperm quality and/or function. Despite promising discoveries, a causal relationship between the reproductive disorders and exposure to specific toxicants has yet to be established, due to the complexity of the clinical protocols used, the degree of occupational or environmental exposure, the determination of the variables measured and the sample size of the subjects examined.

In the present review, the occurrence of PFAAs and their behavior in aquatic ecosystem were summarized, and the health and ecological risk assessment and the multimedia fate simulation were investigated. PFAAs are most likely to exist in the aqueous phase, and PFAAs in atmosphere are also able to enter water bodies through diffusion and wet and dry deposition and eventually become widely distributed in various environmental media. The air-solid partition is considered to be one of the major factors in the long-distance transportation of the pollutants. The pKa values and organic carbon fraction of the sediment could influence the partition of PFAAs between water and sediment. Otherwise, PFAAs have teratogenic, mutagenic and other toxic effects and they could be accumulated by biota, and magnified through trophic level. The ecological and health risks of PFOA and PFOS were assessment. In order to explore the partition mechanism and reduce the uncertainty of the simulation of the transport, transformation and fate, the experimental methods on physicochemical properties of PFAAs should be developed. Moreover, further studies on toxicities of PFAAs are necessary for health and ecological risk assessment. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Over 40,000 chemicals are approved for commercial use. The challenge is to prioritize chemicals for biomonitoring that may present health risk concerns. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to prioritize chemicals that may elicit child health effects of interest to ECHO but that have not been biomonitored nationwide and to identify gaps needing additional research. METHODS: We searched databases and the literature for chemicals in environmental media and in consumer products that were potentially toxic. We selected chemicals that were not measured in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. From over 700 chemicals, we chose 155 chemicals and created eight chemical panels. For each chemical, we compiled biomonitoring and toxicity data, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency exposure predictions, and annual production usage. We also applied predictive modeling to estimate toxicity. Using these data, we recommended chemicals either for biomonitoring, to be deferred pending additional data, or as low priority for biomonitoring. RESULTS: For the 155 chemicals, 97 were measured in food or water, 67 in air or house dust, and 52 in biospecimens. We found in vivo endocrine, developmental, reproductive, and neurotoxic effects for 61, 74, 47, and 32 chemicals, respectively. Eighty-six had data from high-throughput in vitro assays. Positive results for endocrine, developmental, neurotoxicity, and obesity were observed for 32, 11, 35, and 60 chemicals, respectively. Predictive modeling results suggested 90% are toxicants. Biomarkers were reported for 76 chemicals. Thirty-six were recommended for biomonitoring, 108 deferred pending additional research, and 11 as low priority for biomonitoring. DISCUSSION: The 108 deferred chemicals included those lacking biomonitoring methods or toxicity data, representing an opportunity for future research. Our evaluation was, in general, limited by the large number of unmeasured or untested chemicals. © 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Yet of those thousands of chemicals, only just over one thousand have been formally examined and graded for their carcinogenic potential. Of those, five hundred have been found worthy of being graded on a cautiously worded scale ranging from ""known""carcinogens to ""possibly""carcinogenic. In addition to carcinogenic substances, a new field has emerged researching how environmental toxins cause endocrine or hormonal disruption. A class of these compounds known as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can be found in our food, our environment, and in the products we put on our bodies. Rather than being directly linked to causing cancer, like substances such as asbestos, EDCs influence our health by mimicking or enhancing or changing metabolic regulation. These compounds interfere with hormone production and metabolism in ways that may-especially over the long term-create biological conditions that make us more susceptible to cancer and other diseases. Most of us are exposed to a cocktail of environmental toxins on an ongoing daily basis and at a relatively low level of exposure. Given the lax regulation of chemicals and the reactionary approach of government regulators, it is up to the consumer to be diligent about reading labels and making healthy choices to limit exposure to chemicals and toxins. It is ideal to adopt the Precautionary Principle: until a chemical is found to be harmless, try to not use it. The precautionary principle means that you are maintaining awareness of what you are putting on and in your body and taking steps to avoid exposing yourself unnecessarily to toxins in your household and environment. © 2019 the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; asbestos; carcinogen; endocrine disruptor; flame retardant; formaldehyde; perfluoro compound; phthalic acid; vinyl chloride; awareness; cancer susceptibility; carcinogenicity; consumer; environmental exposure; environmental protection; geography; government regulation; health hazard; hormone synthesis; household; human; long term exposure; malignant neoplasm; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; pollution; Review"

In this paper, we assess the potential risks related to the application of CCS technology and the acidification of aquatic ecosystems through CO2 enrichment. We use the multiple lines of evidence approach (LOEs) to characterize the effects of the acidification with contamination in aquatic sediments. We highlight and discuss the effects of acidification on the LOEs including contamination and mobility of contaminants in sediments, toxicity, macrobenthic community structure, in situ effects, and bioaccumulation-biomagnification processes. We further assess the results of acidification on the toxicity of organic contaminants such as antibiotics or illicit drugs like the freebase form of cocaine (crack). The main goal of using the LOE approach is to distinguish between adverse effects that are associated with contaminants and those related to acidification by enrichment of CO2 as a result of CCS technology. Previous assessments were not designed or conducted to incorporate an integrative point of view, nor did they employ a weight of evidence approach (WOE) in risk characterization and management of CCS operations and other situations related to acidification by enrichment of CO2 in the aquatic ecosystem. Based on the findings of this review, the WOE can identify the effects of the acidification on the different LOEs used for sediment quality: contaminant mobility, the adverse effects in organism under laboratory and field conditions, and the bioaccumulation-biomagnification of contaminants. The main strength in using the WOE is the ability of this method to discriminate between LOE responses associated with contamination by different organic and inorganic substances from those related to CO2 acidification itself. The WOE will significantly improve the risk assessment in areas affected by potential leakages of CO2 during CCS operations. © 2019 Published by NRC Research Press.","Acidification; Aquatic ecosystems; Atmospheric chemistry; Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Contamination; Greenhouse gases; Risk assessment; Risk management; Sedimentology; Sediments; Toxicity; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Bioavailability; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Emerging pollutants; Integrative assessment; Technological development; Weight of evidence approach; Weight of evidences; Carbon capture"

Hence, the development of highly efficient methods for introducing fluoroalkyl groups is of primary importance. In recent years, the reactions based on fluoroalkyl radicals have been developed into competent methods for introducing fluoroalkyl groups. On the other hand, the synthesis of the chiral molecules containing fluoroalkyl groups has attracted considerable attentions. However, attributed to the high reactivity of the fluoroalkyl radicals, the control of the reaction selectivity is difficult. Particularly, so far there have been only limited reports on the enantiocontrol of the reaction in this regard and the corresponding review of the field still lacks. This review summarizes the research on the asymmetric synthesis based on fluoroalkyl radical reactions developed over the past 20 years. The review introduces the selectivities, scope and mechanism of various reactions. It is divided into three different parts according to the type of the reaction: (1) asymmetric fluoroalkylation of enol/enamine intermediate through fluoroalkyl radical, (2) asymmetric difunctionalization of olefin through fluoroalkyl radical, (3) stereoselective 1,2-shift of vinylboronate complexes through fluoroalkyl radical. © 2019 Chinese Chemical Society & SIOC, CAS.",

The transition metals are introduced to allow new possibilities for activating carbon-fluorine bonds and are gradually becoming an alternative way to synthesize numerous complex organics containing fluorine. In this review, the recent works on the theoretical mechanistic study for transition metals mediated carbon-fluorine bonds activation and cleavage are summarized. Meanwhile, the general modes of carbon-fluorine bonds activation have been concluded systematically, including the oxidative addition of carbon-fluorine bonds to transition metals, transition-metal-activated nucleophilic substitution, S N 2 type activation of carbon(sp 3 )-fluorine bonds and β-fluorine elimination, etc. The theoretical calculation shows that the reaction could be proceed by an oxidation addition mode, when the zero-valent nickel catalyst with strong reducibility is employed. However, if a zero-valent platinum catalyst is used, oxidation addition only occurs at extra activated carbon-fluorine bonds. In the reduction of polyfluorinated aromatic hydrocarbons by hydrogenated metal species, aromatic nucleophilic substitution between hydride and polyfluorinated aromatic hydrocarbons could occur to realize the activation of carbon-fluoride bonds. For carbon(sp 3 )-fluorine bonds, if ""hard"" Lewis base such as lithium or magnesium salt is employed, the carbon(sp 3 )-fluorine bonds can be activated via bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S N 2). In addition, β-fluoride elimination is also frequently proposed in transition metal-catalyzed C-F functionalizations. © 2019 Chinese Chemical Society & SIOC, CAS.",

Increasing number of emerging pollutants resulting from industrial/human-made activities represents a serious menace to the ecological and environmental equilibrium. Industrial dyes, endocrine disrupters, pesticides, phenols and halogenated phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and other xenobiotics are among the top priority environmental pollutants. Some classical remediation approaches including physical, chemical and biological are being employed, but are ineffective in cleaning the environment. Enzyme-catalyzed transformation reactions are gearing accelerating attention in this context as potential alternatives to classical chemical methods. Peroxidases are catalysts able to decontaminate an array of toxic compounds by a free radical mechanism resulting in oxidized or depolymerized products along with a significant toxicity reduction. Admittedly, enzymatic catalysis offers the hallmark of high chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity and superior catalytic efficiency under given reaction environment. Moreover, enzymes are considered more benign, socially acceptable and greener production routes since derived from the renewable and sustainable feedstock. Regardless of their versatility and potential use in environmental processes, several limitations, such as heterologous production, catalytic stability, and redox potential should be overcome to implement peroxidases at large-scale transformation and bio-elimination of recalcitrant pollutants. In this article, a critical review of the transformation of different types of hazardous pollutants by peroxidases, with special reference to the proposed reaction mechanisms of several dyes is presented.

One quarter of all agrochemicals was chiral in 1996, and this proportion has increased remarkably with the introduction of new compounds over time. Despite scientists have made great efforts to probe the enantiomeric selectivity of chiral chemicals in the environment since early 1990s, the different behaviours of individual enantiomers in biologically mediated processes are still unclear. In the present review, we highlight state-of-the-knowledge on the stereoselective biotransformation and accumulation of chiral contaminants in organisms ranging from invertebrates to humans. Chiral insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pharmaceuticals, flame retardants hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are all included in the target compounds. Key findings included: a) Changes in the enantiomeric fractions in vitro and in vivo models revealed that enantioselectivity commonly occurs in biotransformation and bioaccumulation. b) Emerging contaminants have become more important in the field of enantioselectivity together with their metabolites in biological transformation process. c) Chiral signatures have also been regarded as powerful tools for tracking pollution sources when the contribution of precursor is unknown. Future studies are needed in order to understand not only preliminary enrichment results but also detailed molecular mechanisms in diverse models to comprehensively understand the behaviours of chiral compounds.

The main aim of the study was to review the current data on PFASs in human breast milk, including the challenges of analysis as well as the possible modes of transfer from maternal blood. In this paper, previously published data on the concentrations of PFASs in human breast milk from around the world were reviewed and summarised. Eligible studies with reference lists published before 1 June 2017 were included by searching several databases (including Scopus, ScienceOpen and SciFinder). From this search, studies with the number of participants in each study ranging from 2 to 1237 were identified. The review indicated that based on the structural profiles and concentration levels, there was variation in the geographical distribution of these compounds in breast milk. Although there are no recorded investigations on the modes of transfer from maternal blood to breast milk, literature suggests that the PFASs tend to be transferred through binding to various proteins. The review also examined the different sample preparation and analytical methods employed to measure the concentrations of PFASs in human breast milk. This showed that solid phase extraction was the most common extraction method. After extraction, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was the most common analysis method. Since several of these methods were initially dedicated to monitoring PFASs in food and water, they demonstrate some limitations with regard to specificity and sensitivity to human fluids. Additionally, there are currently no published records of certified reference materials and/or proficiency scheme devoted to standardising PFAS concentrations in breast milk. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","analytical method; biomonitoring; concentration (composition); database; fluorocarbon; geographical distribution; literature review; milk; organic acid; pollutant transport; sample preparation; Scopus; fluorocarbon; analysis; breast feeding; breast milk; chemistry; female; gas chromatography; human; liquid chromatography; pharmacokinetics; pollutant; procedures; solid phase extraction; specimen handling; tandem mass spectrometry; Breast Feeding; Chromatography, Gas; Chromatography, Liquid; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Milk, Human; Solid Phase Extraction; Specimen Handling; Tandem Mass Spectrometry"

However, due to limited organocopper(III) compounds with well-defined structures, this elementary reaction still remains an extremely challenging issue. In this review, structurally well-defined organocopper(III) compounds are mainly divided into three classes based on their ligands: perfluoromethyl Cu(III) compounds, macrocyclic ligand-based aryl-Cu(III) compounds, and spiro organocopper(III) compounds chelated by bidentate ligands. The majority of organocopper(III) compounds display the typical square planar geometry. There also exist a few penta-coordinated organocopper(III) complexes, which share a weak apical Cu-L bond. In order to form a cis Cu(III)–C and Cu(III)–Nu bonding geometry required for reductive elimination, the re-arrangement of coordination modes around tetra-coordinated Cu(III) atoms is necessary. For the aryl-Cu(III) cationic complexes with one Cu(III)–C bond, the re-arrangement is triggered by the coordination of the fifth ligand (solvent or nucleophiles), while for the tetra-carbon-coordinated organocuprate(III) compounds, the process might be realized via the cleavage of one Cu(III)–C bond by attack of electrophiles. Stoichiometric and catalytic reactions involving well-defined organocopper(III) compounds to form C—C or C–heteroatom bonds are discussed to support their intermediacy. © 2018 SIOC, CAS, Shanghai, & WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

One issue associated with WWTP operation is the potential for groundwater contamination via leaking or infiltration of wastewater, particularly with inorganic nutrients (ammonia and nitrate) as well as persistent organic compounds. Despite the potential for such contamination to create environmental and health risks, conventional methods, such as the assessment of major ions, nutrients, bacteriological indicators and conventional tracers (such as stable and radiogenic isotopes) are often unable to provide accurate delineation of multiple potential sources of contamination. This is particularly important for WWTPs which often occur in urban, peri-urban or intensively farmed agricultural areas where multiple potential sources (such as livestock, fertilisers, wastewater irrigation, and domestic septic systems) may contribute similar contaminants. This review explores the applicability of promising novel groundwater tracers, such as Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) and isotopic tracers, which can be used in conjunction with conventional tracers (i.e. ‘co-tracers’) to provide a more definitive assessment of contaminant sources, plume delineation and even (potentially) indicating the age of contamination (e.g., recent vs. legacy). The suitability of the novel groundwater tracers is evaluated according to four key criteria: (i). sufficient presence in raw wastewater and/or treated effluents; (ii) diagnostic of WWTP impacts as opposed to other potential off-site contamination sources; (iii) persistence in the subsurface environment; and (iv) amenable to rapid and sensitive analysis. Further analysis of various classes of CECs along with improved detection limits associated with improvements in analytical methodologies should allow for future application of promising groundwater tracers, providing WWTP operators and regulatory authorities a more definitive toolbox with which to assess groundwater contamination associated with site operations. These include: persistent pharmaceuticals and personal care products (carbamazepine, crotamiton, primidone, atenolol and sulfamethoxazole), artificial sweeteners (acesulfame, sucralose, saccharin and cyclamate) and potentially, certain pesticides (atrazine and simazine). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Amides; Ammonia; Contamination; Effluents; Groundwater; Health risks; Impurities; Isotopes; Nutrients; Risk assessment; Sewage pumping plants; Sugar substitutes; Sustainable development; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Analytical methodology; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Environmental and health risks; Groundwater contamination; Novel groundwater traces; Persistent organic compounds; Pharmaceuticals and personal care products; Wastewater treatment plants; Groundwater pollution; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; acesulfame; ammonia; atenolol; atrazine; bromodichloromethane; caffeine; carbamazepine; chloroform; crotamiton; cyanazine; cyclamate sodium; dibromochloromethane; dimethylnitrosamine; estrone; gemfibrozil; ground water; ion; nitrate; nonylphenol; organic compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pesticide; primidone; saccharin; simazine; sucralose; sulfamethoxazole; tracer; pesticide; bacterium; environmental impact; environmental indicator; environmental management; environmental risk; groundwater pollution; infiltration; leakage; persistent organic pollutant; sustainability; tracer; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; activated sludge; disinfection; domestic waste; environmental impact; environmental sustainability; health hazard; indicator organism; inorganic nutrient; limit of detection; livestock; persistent organic pollutant; plume; Review; rural area; urban area; waste water; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; water contamination; environmental monitoring; waste water; water pollutant; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Pesticides; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

However, currently we only have limited information about their eco-toxicological impacts on the ecosystem and human beings. For this reason, it is important to assess the contamination levels of common POPs (DDT, HCH, HCB, PCB, heptachlor, and ∑PFAAs, PFOA, PFOS) and their damaging impacts on the health of people and ecosystems in Bangladesh. Admittedly, POPs are extremely resistant to natural decomposition in the environment and remain in the aquatic environment, soil, food cycles, and finally in the human body for decades even after production has stopped. POPs are proven to adversely affect people's health. Indeed, they can disrupt endocrine, reproductive, immune and nervous systems as well as cause behavioral problems, diabetes, thyroid problems, and even cancer. As well, these contaminants interrupt the food chain and resist vital physiological functions in the long term. Therefore, investigations of environmental and ecological impacts of POPs on physiological functions of the human body are urgently required. This review paper aims to summarize the environmental toxicity levels of POPs in Bangladesh and their lethal concentrations which are creating diseases through the destruction of the human body's vital organs. The findings will underpin future policies and lead to good, practical decisions regarding how to properly manage of POPs contamination in the ecosystem of Bangladesh and on a global scale. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

DGVMs are designed to simulate the structural and functional responses of global vegetation to changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 concentration with the coexistence of plant functional types (PFTs). PFTs are groups of plant species with similar functions based on morphological, physiological, biochemical, reproductive, and demographic characteristics. DGVMs typically assign each PFT with fixed parameters representing the above characteristics, consequently ignoring their variations within PFT and their responses to environmental changes. This parameterization scheme can simplify plant species represented in DGVMs but inevitably result in large uncertainties in model predictions on ecosystem processes. Therefore, a new generation of DGVMs are urgently needed to overcome the limitations of PFTs by replacing the PFTs parameterization scheme with continuous variation in plant functional traits. Plant functional traits (FTs) are defined as morphological, physiological, and phenological characteristics that affect plants via their effects on the growth, reproduction, and survival. Plant FTs that mediate the structure and function of ecosystems can be implemented into DGVMs as variables rather than PFT-specific parameters with fixed values. The plant FT scheme not only provides a widely applicable approach for forecasting ecosystem shifts and changes in ecosystem structure, but can also be linked with ecosystem functions under a changing climate. This holds great potentials for predicting possible responses of terrestrial ecosystems to environmental changes. This review first introduces the state-of-the-art DGVMs based on PFTs. PFTs represent most of the world's vegetation types and characteristics through their functional behaviors and attributes. Although PFT-based DGVMs play a pivotal role in simulating atmosphere-land interactions by quantifying the processes of global carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles, uncertainties arise from inadequate PFT parameters and incomplete PFT classification. For example, many traits vary more within PFTs than between PFTs. Moreover, the values assigned to different PFTs often do not differ much-so little is gained (and much uncertainty is added) compared to a generic model where all plants behave identically. This paper also reviews the recent progress in plant FTs for developing new generations of DGVMs, which includes: (1) descripting adaption strategies of plants to the changing environment, (2) revealing the mechanisms of coexistence between plant species, (3) highlighting the close relationship with the structures and processes of ecosystems, and (4) summarizing their application in the parameterization of vegetation models. We also summarize the main approaches to improve current or build new DGVMs based on FTs, such as building a transitional framework for a PFT-FT hybrid DGVM and building a completely FT-based DGVM. Based on those discussions, several future research directions are recommended for developing a new-generation DGVMs, such as improving the prediction power of traits within the PFTs, building the mechanism expressions between plant adaptations and environments, and standardizing of the data sharing for FTs. We argue that constructing next generation of DGVMs is not simply a matter of incorporating trait-climate relationships, but more importantly to combine optimality concepts and classical vegetation dynamic theories making vegetation modelling more reliable and robust. Botanists, geographers, vegetation modelers, and other relevant scientists should cooperate and share the trait data to elucidate the huge potential of plant FTs in constructing the next generation of more reliable, robust and realistic DGVMs. We hope this review will promote the developments and applications of new generation DGVMs in China. © 2018, Science Press.

The discovery of the existence of a prokaryotic cytoskeleton has changed this picture significantly. As a result, the idea has taken shape that the appearance of actin occurred in the very first cell; therefore, the emergence of microfilaments precedes that of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. The discovery of nuclear actin opened new perspective on the field, suggesting that the nuclear activities of actin reflect the functions of primordial actin-like proteins. In this paper, we review the recent literature to explore the evolutionary origin of nuclear actin.

These direct transformations provide new approaches in synthesis with high atom- and step-economy compared to the traditional catalytic cross-coupling reactions. However, such methods still suffer from several limitations including functional group tolerance and the lack of regioselectivity. In addition, they often require harsh reaction conditions and some of them need the use of strong oxidant, in a stoichiometric amount, avoiding these processes to be truly eco-friendly. The use of photoredox catalysis has contributed to a significant expansion of the scope of C(sp2)-H bond functionalizations which include the direct arylations, (perfluoro)alkylations, acylations, and even cyanations. Most of these transformations involve the photochemical induced generation of a radical followed by its regioselective addition to arenes, heteroarenes, or alkenes, leading to the building of a new C(sp2)-C bond. The use of photoredox catalysis plays crucial roles in these reactions promoting electron transfer, enabling the generation of radical species and single electron either oxidation or reduction. Such reactions operating at room temperature allow the building of C-C bonds with high chemo-, regio-, or stereoselectivity. This review surveys the formation of C(sp2)-C bonds initiated by photoredox catalysis which involves a C(sp2)-H bond functionalization step, describes the advantages compared to traditional C(sp2)-H bond functionalizations, and presents mechanistic insights into the role played by the photoredox catalysts. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","Aromatic compounds; Covalent bonds; Free radical reactions; Hydrocarbons; Regioselectivity; Transition metals; Cross coupling reactions; Electron transfer; Functionalizations; Intensive research; Photoredox catalysis; Radical species; Reaction conditions; Regioselective addition; Catalysis"

Dairy products and specific oils such as coconut oil are natural sources of dietary caprylic acid. MCFAs display distinct chemico-physical and metabolic properties from those of long-chain saturated fatty acids (LCFAs ≥ 12 carbons) and potential beneficial physiological effects of dietary C8:0 have been studied for many years. More recently, caprylic acid was shown to octanoylate ghrelin, the only known peptide hormone with an orexigenic effect. Through its covalent binding to the ghrelin peptide, caprylic acid exhibits an emerging and specific role in modulating physiological functions themselves regulated by octanoylated ghrelin. Dietary caprylic acid is therefore now suspected to provide the ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) enzyme with octanoyl-CoA co-substrates necessary for the acyl modification of ghrelin. Recent studies suggest that decreasing the circulating octanoylated ghrelin level through the inhibition of GOAT activity, or simply by modulating the availability of its C8:0 substrate, might constitute a therapeutic strategy against obesity.

CPN is constitutively active, whereas CPB2 circulates as a precursor, procarboxypeptidase B2 (proCPB2), that needs to be activated by the thrombin–thrombomodulin complex or plasmin bound to glycosaminoglycans. The substrate specificities of CPB2 and CPN are similar; they both remove C-terminal basic amino acids from bioactive peptides and proteins, thereby inactivating them. The complement cascade is a cascade of proteases and cofactors activated by pathogens or dead cells, divided into two phases, with the second phase only being triggered if sufficient C3b is present. Complement activation generates anaphylatoxins: C3a, which stimulates macrophages; and C5a, which is an activator and attractant for neutrophils. Pharmacological intervention with inhibitors has shown that CPB2 delays fibrinolysis, whereas CPN is responsible for systemic inactivation of C3a and C5a. Among mice genetically deficient in either CPB2 or CPN, in a model of hemolytic–uremic syndrome, Cpb2−/− mice had the worst disease, followed by Cpn−/− mice, with wild-type (WT) mice being the most protected. This model is driven by C5a, and shows that CPB2 is important in inactivating C5a. In contrast, when mice were challenged acutely with cobra venom factor, the reverse phenotype was observed; Cpn−/− mice had markedly worse disease than Cpb2−/− mice, and WT mice were resistant. These observations need to be confirmed in humans. Therefore, CPB2 and CPN have different roles. CPN inactivates C3a and C5a generated spontaneously, whereas proCPB2 is activated at specific sites, where it inactivates bioactive peptides that would overwhelm CPN. © 2018 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis","arginine carboxypeptidase; complement component C3a; complement component C3b; complement component C4; complement component C4b; complement component C5; complement component C5b; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; ds 1040; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; peptide hydrolase inhibitor; plerixafor; protein C; proteinase activated receptor 1; stromal cell derived factor 1; thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor; uk 396082; unclassified drug; acute lung injury; blood clotting; complement activation; complement system; drug safety; human; inflammation; innate immunity; molecular interaction; nonhuman; priority journal; protein cleavage; protein localization; protein structure; pulmonary hypertension; Review; septicemia; single nucleotide polymorphism; thrombosis; wound healing"

This review assessed recent studies that examined the relationship of air pollution, metals, and other organic pollutants with children’s blood pressure outcomes. We restricted this review to peer-reviewed studies published in English between January 2007 and July 2017. We identified a total of 36 articles that estimated associations with childhood blood pressure, of which 14 studies examined the effects of air pollution, 10 examined metals, and 12 examined other organic pollutants including phthalates (n = 4), Bisphenol A (n = 3), polychlorinated biphenols (n = 2), organophosphate pesticides (n = 2), or perfluoroalkyl acids (n = 1). Similar to the established relationship between tobacco smoke exposure and childhood blood pressure, the majority of studies that examined air pollutants, particularly exposure to PM10 and PM2.5, reported associations with increased childhood blood pressure. The literature reported conflicting evidence for metals, and putative evidence of the effects of exposure to phthalates, Bisphenol A, polychlorinated biphenols, and pesticides. Overall, our review underscores the need for additional studies that assess the impact of nephrotoxicant exposure during early life, particularly the perinatal period, and blood pressure in childhood. © 2018, International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; environmental chemical; organic compound; organophosphate pesticide; phthalic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; tobacco smoke; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; acid; benzhydryl derivative; metal; organic compound; organophosphate; pesticide; phenol derivative; phthalic acid derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; air pollutant; air pollution; blood pressure; child; disease association; environmental exposure; human; particulate matter; perinatal period; priority journal; Review; adverse event; blood pressure; drug effect; female; hypertension; infant; male; maternal exposure; newborn; pregnancy; preschool child; Acids; Air Pollutants; Benzhydryl Compounds; Blood Pressure; Child, Preschool; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maternal Exposure; Metals; Organic Chemicals; Organophosphates; Pesticides; Phenols; Phthalic Acids; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Pregnancy"

The perfluorinated alkylate substances (PFASs) are persistent emerging pollutants that are now being recognized as important human health hazards. Although the PFASs have been produced for over 60 years, academic research on environmental health aspects has appeared only in the most recent 10 years or so. In the meantime, these persistent chemicals accumulated in the global environment. Some early studies e.g., on population exposures and toxicity, were not released to the public until after year 2000. Still, the first PFAS risk assessments ignored these reports and relied on scant journal publications. The first guidelines and legal limits for PFAS exposure, e.g., from drinking water, were proposed 10 years ago. They have decreased substantially since then, but remain higher than suggested by data on human adverse effects, especially on the immune system, that occur at background exposure levels. By now, the best-known PFASs are being phased out, and related PFASs are being introduced as substitutes. Given the substantial delays in discovery of PFAS toxicity, in dissemination of findings, and in regulatory decisions, PFAS substitutes and other persistent industrial chemicals should be subjected to prior scrutiny before widespread usage. © 2018 The Author(s).","drinking water; perfluorinated alkylate substance; perfluoro compound; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; academic research; chemical pollutant; chemical substance; ecosystem health; health risk; immune system; pollution exposure; public health; toxicity; antibody titer; case study; disease association; environmental exposure; environmental health; health hazard; human; immunotoxicity; mortality; nonhuman; population exposure; priority journal; public health; Review; risk assessment; therapy delay; analysis; environmental monitoring; pollutant; toxicity; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans"

It is essential for protection against infections and for orchestrating inflammatory responses. Recent studies have also demonstrated contribution of the complement system to several homeostatic processes that are traditionally not considered to be involved in immunity. Thus, complement regulates homeostasis and immunity. However, dysregulation of this system contributes to several pathologies including inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Unexpectedly, studies of the last decade have also revealed that complement promotes cancer progression. Since the initial discovery of tumor promoting role of complement, numerous preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated contribution of several complement components to regulation of tumor growth through their direct interactions with the corresponding receptors on tumor cells or through suppression of antitumor immunity. Most of this work, however, focused on a role of complement in regulating growth of primary tumors. Only recently, a few studies showed that complement promotes cancer metastasis through its contribution to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the premetastatic niche. This latter work has shown that complement activation and generation of complement effectors including C5a occur in organs that are target for metastasis prior to arrival of the very first tumor cells. C5a through its interactions with C5a receptor 1 inhibits antitumor immunity by activating and recruiting immunosuppressive cells from the bone marrow to the premetastatic niche and by regulating function and self-renewal of pulmonary tissue-resident alveolar macrophages. These new advancements provide additional evidence for multifaceted functions of complement in cancer. © 2018 Kochanek, Ghouse, Karbowniczek and Markiewski.","calgranulin A; calgranulin B; CD59 antigen; claudin 1; complement; complement component C3b; complement component C4b; complement component C5a; complement component C5a receptor; complement component C5b; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement membrane attack complex; complement receptor; complement receptor 2; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; interleukin 10; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; placental growth factor; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor; Twist related protein 1; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; uvomorulin; vasculotropin A; adaptive immunity; antitumor gene; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell motility; cytotoxicity; epithelial mesenchymal transition; exosome; extracellular matrix; homeostasis; human; immune deficiency; inflammation; innate immunity; lung alveolus macrophage; metastasis; nonhuman; Review; tissue regeneration; tumor growth; tumor immunity; tumor promotion; tumor suppressor gene; tumor vascularization; vascularization"

The affinity of TBA for soil organic matter suggests prolonged contamination; degradation leads to the release of the metabolite desethylterbuthylazine (DET), which has higher water solubility and binds more weakly to organic matter compared to the parent compound, resulting in higher associated risk for contamination of groundwater resources. Additionally, TBA and DET are chemicals of emerging concern because of their persistence and toxicity towards aquatic organisms; moreover, they are known to have significant endocrine disruption capacity to wildlife and humans. Conventional treatments applied during drinking water production do not lead to the complete removal of these chemicals; activated carbon provides the greatest efficiency, whereas ozonation can generate by-products with comparable oestrogenic activity to atrazine. Hydrogen peroxide alone is ineffective to degrade TBA, while UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation and photocatalysis are the most effective processes for oxidation of TBA. It has been determined that direct photolysis gives the highest degradation efficiency of all UV/H2O2 treatments, while most of the photocatalytic degradation is attributed to OH radicals, and TiO2 solar-photocatalytic ozonation can lead to almost complete TBA removal in ∼30 min. Constructed wetlands provide a valuable buffer capacity, protecting downstream surface waters from contaminated runoff.

Long retention times in lakes mean pollutants from discharges slowly circulate around the lakes and may lead to high ecological risk for ecosystem and human health. In recent decades, antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been regarded as emerging pollutants. The occurrence and distribution of antibiotics and ARGs in global freshwater lakes are summarized to show the pollution level of antibiotics and ARGs and to identify some of the potential risks to ecosystem and human health. Fifty-seven antibiotics were reported at least once in the studied lakes. Our meta-analysis shows that sulfamethoxazole, sulfamerazine, sulfameter, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, erythromycin, and roxithromycin were found at high concentrations in both lake water and lake sediment. There is no significant difference in the concentration of sulfonamides in lake water from China and that from other countries worldwide; however, there was a significant difference in quinolones. Erythromycin had the lowest predicted hazardous concentration for 5% of the species (HC5) and the highest ecological risk in lakes. There was no significant difference in the concentration of sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1 and sul2) in lake water and river water. There is surprisingly limited research on the role of aquatic biota in propagation of ARGs in freshwater lakes. As an environment that is susceptible to cumulative build-up of pollutants, lakes provide an important environment to study the fate of antibiotics and transport of ARGs with a broad range of niches including bacterial community, aquatic plants and animals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Amides; Antibiotics; Aquatic organisms; Ecosystems; Genes; Health risks; Lakes; River pollution; Sulfur compounds; Water; Antibiotic resistance genes; Aquatic biota; Meta analysis; Niche; Species sensitivity distributions; Lake pollution; antibiotic agent; erythromycin; lake water; lincosamide; macrolide; oxytetracycline; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; river water; roxithromycin; sulfamerazine; sulfamethoxazole; sulfametoxydiazine; sulfonamide; tetracycline; trimethoprim derivative; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; antibiotics; biota; lake pollution; meta-analysis; sensitivity analysis; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance gene; China; concentration (parameters); ecology; ecosystem; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; gene; geographic distribution; health hazard; lake; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; sediment; sul1 gene; sul2 gene; systematic review; water analysis; water pollution; analysis; antibiotic resistance; bacterial gene; bacterium; chemistry; drug effect; genetics; meta analysis; microbiology; China; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Genes, Bacterial; Geologic Sediments; Lakes"

The hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of PFASs affect the sorption behaviour and suggest organic carbon may not be the only factor affecting sorption. We reviewed the quality of all data published in peer-reviewed literature on sorption of PFASs to critically evaluate the role organic carbon (OC) and other properties have in sorption of PFASs in soils or sediments. The largest data sets available were for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, n = 147) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS, n = 178), and these analyses showed very weak correlations between sorption coefficient (Kd) and OC alone (R2 = 0.05–0.07). When only laboratory-derived Kd values of PFASs and OC were analysed, the R2 values increased for PFOA (R2 = 0.24, n = 42), PFOS (R2 = 0.38, n = 69), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA, R2 = 0.77 n = 12), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA, R2 = 0.78, n = 13). However, the relationships were heavily skewed by one or two high OC values. Similarly there was no significant relationship between Kd values and pH for PFOS (R2 = 0.06) and PFOA (R2 = 0.07), across a range of environmental pH values. Our analyses showed sorption behaviour of a range of PFASs could not be explained by a single soil or sediment property. Multiple regression models better explained the sorption behaviour of a number of PFASs. Regressions of OC and pH together explained a significant proportion of the variation in Kd values for 9 out of 14 PFASs and 8 of these regressions had ≥10 data points. This review highlighted that at least OC, pH and clay content are properties having significant effect on sorption. There is a clear need for more data and studies with thorough characterisation of soils or sediments to better understand their role in PFASs sorption. Current assessments based on OC alone are likely to be erroneous. © 2018","Organic carbon; pH; Quality control; Regression analysis; Sediments; Soils; Environmental contamination; Hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties; Multiple regression model; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; PFOA; PFOS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Sorption coefficients; Sorption; alkyl group; cation; fluorine derivative; organic carbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; polyfunctional group; unclassified drug; organic carbon; pH; regression analysis; sediment property; soil property; sorption; surfactant; anion exchange; biosorption; cation exchange; chemical analysis; chemical composition; correlational study; desorption; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; ionic strength; pH; priority journal; Review; sediment; soil acidity; soil chemistry; soil pollution; synthesis"

We conducted a rapid systematic review on breastfeeding practices and serum concentrations of PFASs—specifically PFOS and PFOA—among reproductive-aged women and young children using the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology. Recent findings: We included 14 studies examining associations between breastfeeding and PFASs in infants/toddlers or pregnant/postnatal women. Breastfeeding was significantly associated with lower PFASs exposure among women and higher PFASs exposure among children. Summary: We concluded there was “sufficient” evidence supporting an association between breastfeeding and serum PFASs concentrations among women, and “limited” evidence of an association among children due to issues with sample size, confounding, and exposure assessment. These findings reinforce that lactation is an important excretion route of PFASs for women, and that breast milk may be an important exposure pathway for young children. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; adult; analysis; blood; breast feeding; breast milk; environmental exposure; female; human; infant; metabolism; pregnancy; Adult; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Breast Feeding; Environmental Exposure; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Infant; Milk, Human; Pregnancy"

Appropriate animal model selection is required to effectively recapitulate the human experience, including relevant dosing and windows of exposure, and ensure translational utility and reproducibility. While classical toxicology heavily relies on inbred rats and mice, and focuses on apical endpoints such as tumor formation or birth defects, EDC researchers have used a greater diversity of species to effectively model more subtle but significant outcomes such as changes in pubertal timing, mammary gland development, and social behaviors. Advances in genomics, neuroimaging and other tools are making a wider range of animal models more widely available to EDC researchers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","diethylstilbestrol; endocrine disruptor; perfluoro compound; thalidomide; endocrine disruptor; animal model; chemical accident; genetic resource; human; monogamy; nonhuman; Review; toxicity; toxicology; transgenic animal; zebra fish; animal; chemically induced; disease model; drug effect; endocrine disease; endocrine system; environmental disease; environmental exposure; pathology; physiology; reproducibility; reproduction; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Endocrine Disruptors; Endocrine System; Endocrine System Diseases; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Illness; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Reproduction"

PFCs are non-biodegradable and bioaccumulate in the environment and for these reasons they have been a major subject of research regarding their toxicity, environmental fate, and sources of human exposure, since they have been shown to induce severe health consequences, such as neonatal mortality, neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity. The aim of this review is to explore the existing knowledge of the interplay between PFCs exposure and human health, with a focus on male reproductive health, given the emerging gender differences in PFCs clearance and their interaction with sex hormones receptors. A comprehensive PUBMED search was performed using relevant key terms for PFCs and male fertility. Different degrees of evidence suggest an impairment of semen parameters and sex hormones in relation to PFCs exposure. These preliminary results point towards a sex-dependent pharmacodynamics and clearance, with males having a much higher tendency to accumulation. Moreover, because of the widespread environmental occurrence of these chemicals, along with their ability to cross the placental barrier, exposure of the foetus to these compounds is inevitable. This is of concern because foetal development of the male reproductive organs may be disturbed by exposure to exogenous factors. These findings clearly suggest an antiandrogenic potential of PFCs and a link between endocrine disruptors and disorders of male health. © 2017, Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).","organic anion transporter; perfluoro compound; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorododecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; sex hormone; endocrine disruptor; fluorinated hydrocarbon; bioaccumulation; environmental exposure; half life time; health hazard; human; male fertility; nonhuman; prenatal exposure; protein function; renal clearance; Review; semen abnormality; sex difference; spermatogenesis; testis disease; tissue distribution; toxicokinetics; chemically induced; drug effect; environmental exposure; health status; male; male infertility; reproduction; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Health Status; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Infertility, Male; Male; Reproduction"

The monitoring of these compounds is difficult because the detection limits of the majority of the available analytical methods cannot achieve the very low target concentrations required to meet proposed environmental quality criteria. In 2014, a combined Science-Policy Interface/Chemical Monitoring of Emerging Pollutants project was launched to meet this monitoring challenge. The project involved 24 research organizations and environmental agencies from 12 different countries. Methods: Sixteen surface water (SW) and 17 wastewater (WW) samples were collected across Europe and analysed using five in vitro effect-based and three chemical analytical methods. A general description of the project and data evaluation is provided by Könemann and colleagues in the companion publication 2018. In our study, we compared bioanalytical and chemical analytical results with regard to their application for aquatic status assessment. Therefore we considered the potential to predict population-relevant risks for aquatic organisms and the specificity and sensitivity of the various methods used in both approaches. Finally, we tested and discussed the applicability and relevance of previously suggested effect-based trigger values (EBT). Results and discussion: Results of the risk assessment based on chemical analytical data correlated highly with estrogenic activities (expressed as 17β-estradiol equivalents (EEQ) determined using effect-based methods), demonstrating the ability of the bioassays to predict the mixture risk caused by steroidal estrogens. For about 15% of SW and 40% of WW samples detection limits of chemical-analytical methods were too high to allow a status assessment, while detection limits of all effect-based methods were below proposed EBT. This demonstrates that effect-based methods are suitable for status assessment of surface waters. The in vitro effect-based methods were quite specific for steroidal estrogens and highly sensitive, meaning they have a low probability to detect false positive or negative results. After testing of three alternative EBT proposals, we concluded to use preliminary 400 pg/L EEQ as screening EBT corresponding to the AA-EQS of E2. Further test specific refinements in the application of this value are not excluded. Conclusions: We conclude that water quality assessment can progress from a purely analytical approach to effect-based monitoring, from single substance to known and unknown mixture assessment and from in vitro screening to population-relevant risk assessment. Despite a few limitations, effect-based in vitro methods are recommendable for monitoring steroidal estrogens under the WFD because they, a) are able to sensitively quantify the activity of steroidal estrogens in all surface and wastewater samples, b) are able to detect the combined effect of estrogen mixtures including unknown chemicals with estrogen receptor activating properties, c) allow an ecotoxicological status assessment using EBT to calculate risk quotients. This approach is similar to the risk ratio used in regulatory environmental risk assessments, but allows for an integrated mixture assessment. Outlook: The results of this study support the introduction of a holistic approach for the regulation of chemicals in the aquatic environment under the EU WFD, as proposed recently by EU Water Directors. An ecotoxicological status assessment for one of the most relevant modes of action of endocrine disruption will allow authorities responsible for water quality assessment to focus available monitoring resources and to improve the ecological status of EU waterbodies. © 2018 Swiss Centre for Applied Ecotoxicology Eawag/EPFL","Aquatic organisms; Chemical detection; Endocrine disrupters; Environmental regulations; Mixtures; Monitoring; Pollution detection; Risk management; Surface waters; Watches; Water conservation; Water pollution; Water pollution control; Water quality; Effect-based methods; Emerging pollutants; Endocrine disruption; Oestrogens; Risk-based; Science - policy interfaces; Watch list; Water Framework Directives; Risk assessment; 17alpha ethinyl estradiol; estradiol; estrogen; estrone; surface water; unclassified drug; analytic method; aquatic environment; bioassay; controlled study; ecotoxicity; environmental monitoring; Europe; false negative result; false positive result; in vitro study; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; risk management; sensitivity and specificity; waste water; water quality"

Water and wastewater samples were collected across Europe and analysed using chemical analyses and EBMs. The results showed that 17β-estradiol equivalents were comparable among methods, while results can vary between methods based on the relative potencies for individual substances. Further, derived 17β-estradiol equivalents were highly correlated with LC-MS/MS analyses.

Fluoropolymers, high molecular weight polymers, have unique properties that constitute a distinct class within the PFAS group. Fluoropolymers have thermal, chemical, photochemical, hydrolytic, oxidative, and biological stability. They have negligible residual monomer and oligomer content and low to no leachables. Fluoropolymers are practically insoluble in water and not subject to long-range transport. With a molecular weight well over 100 000 Da, fluoropolymers cannot cross the cell membrane. Fluoropolymers are not bioavailable or bioaccumulative, as evidenced by toxicology studies on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE): acute and subchronic systemic toxicity, irritation, sensitization, local toxicity on implantation, cytotoxicity, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity, hemolysis, complement activation, and thrombogenicity. Clinical studies of patients receiving permanently implanted PTFE cardiovascular medical devices demonstrate no chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity and no reproductive, developmental, or endocrine toxicity. This paper brings together fluoropolymer toxicity data, human clinical data, and physical, chemical, thermal, and biological data for review and assessment to show that fluoropolymers satisfy widely accepted assessment criteria to be considered as “polymers of low concern” (PLC). This review concludes that fluoropolymers are distinctly different from other polymeric and nonpolymeric PFAS and should be separated from them for hazard assessment or regulatory purposes. Grouping fluoropolymers with all classes of PFAS for “read across” or structure–activity relationship assessment is not scientifically appropriate.

Each kind of Fe-based materials could be functionalized in the most suitable catalysis field, wherever Mössbauer technique may play a unique role. For instance, Fe-N-C based materials are extensively investigated as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction and Mössbauer spectroscopy application in this field has been utilized to identify the chemical nature of the active site on the Fe-N-C catalyst. Iron carbides are considered as the most active phase for FTS and Mössbauer technique is widely applied in determining the chemical phase of catalysts. Fe-based silicates, phosphates or polyanionic compounds are recognized as promising cathode materials for LIBs, for which Mössbauer technique has been mainly applied for tracking of the oxidation state and coordination environment change of Fe between charged and discharged states of the batteries. Similar phenomena can also be found in other catalysis fields. To give a clear understanding of which field is most suitable for a certain Fe-based catalyst and the best role of the Mössbauer technique in a certain catalysis field associated with the investigation of the mechanism, in this review, the recent advances of applying Mössbauer technique in catalysis are thoroughly summarized, including results from environmental catalysis and energy catalysis.

This shift in focus is a result of the rapidly increasing prevalence of ASD coupled with the incomplete penetrance of this disorder in monozygotic twins. One such area of environmentally focused research is the association of exposures to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) with elevated risk for ASD. EDCs are exogenous chemicals that can alter endogenous hormone activity and homeostasis, thus potentially disrupting the action of sex and other natural hormones at all stages of human development. Inasmuch as sex hormones play a fundamental role in brain development and sexual differentiation, exposure to EDCs in utero during critical stages of development can have lasting neurological and other physiological influences on the developing fetus and, ultimately, the child as well as adult. This review will focus on the possible contributions of EDCs to autism risk and pathogenesis by first discussing the influence of endogenous sex hormones on the autistic phenotype, followed by a review of documented human exposures to EDCs and associations with behaviors relevant to ASD. Mechanistic links between EDC exposures and aberrant neurodevelopment and behaviors are then considered, with emphasis on EDC-induced transcriptional profiles derived from animal and cellular studies. Finally, this review will discuss possible mechanisms through which EDC exposure can lead to persistent changes in gene expression and phenotype, which may in turn contribute to transgenerational inheritance of ASD. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; atrazine; chlorphenotane; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1; DNA methyltransferase 3A; estrogen receptor alpha; estrogen receptor beta; organochlorine derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; retinoid related orphan receptor alpha; endocrine disruptor; hormone; autism; brain development; DNA methylation; Dnmt1 gene; Dnmt3a gene; epigenetics; Esr1 gene; Esr2 gene; Esrrg gene; gene; gene expression; homeostasis; hormone action; human; nonhuman; pathogenesis; phenotype; priority journal; Review; risk factor; RORA gene; sex difference; sex differentiation; animal; autism; chemically induced; child; drug effect; environmental exposure; gene expression regulation; genetics; genotype environment interaction; inheritance; physiology; statistics and numerical data; Animals; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene-Environment Interaction; Hormones; Humans; Inheritance Patterns; Risk Factors"

This has resulted in the ‘re-discovery’ of some older antimicrobials and development of new agents, however resistance has also rapidly emerged to these agents. Areas covered: Here we describe recent developments in resistance to three of the most important last-line antimicrobials for treatment of MDR and XDR Gram negatives: fosfomycin, colistin and ceftazidime-avibactam. Expert commentary: A key challenge for microbiologists and clinicians using these agents for treating patients with MDR and XDR Gram negative infections is the need to ensure appropriate reference methods are being used to test susceptibility to these agents, especially colistin and fosfomycin.

We draw mostly on epidemiological and experimental data published in the last decade. For each chemical class considered, we deal with not only the thyroid hormone–disrupting effects but also briefly mention the main mechanisms by which the same chemicals could modify estrogen and/or androgen signalling, thereby exacerbating adverse effects on endocrine-dependent developmental programmes. Further, we emphasize recent data showing how maternal thyroid hormone signalling during early pregnancy affects not only offspring IQ, but also neurodevelopmental disease risk. These recent findings add to established knowledge on the crucial importance of iodine and thyroid hormone for optimal brain development. We propose that prenatal exposure to mixtures of thyroid hormone– disrupting chemicals provides a plausible biological mechanism contributing to current increases in the incidence of neurodevelopmental disease and IQ loss. © 2018 The authors.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; bisphenol F; bisphenol S; chlorphenotane; chlorpyrifos; cigarette smoke; endocrine disruptor; estrogen related receptor; flavonoid; hexachlorobenzene; mancozeb; maneb; messenger RNA; perchlorate; perfluorinated chemical; phthalic acid; polybrominated flame retardant; polychlorinated biphenyl; silicristin; silybilin; silymarin; thiocyanate; thyroid disrupting chemical; thyroid hormone receptor; thyromimetic agent; thyrotropin; triclosan; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; zineb; ziram; attention deficit disorder; brain development; concentration (parameters); human; innate immunity; intelligence quotient; metabolism; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prenatal exposure; priority journal; protein expression; Review; thyroid disease"

Its hexameric complex is built from two related classes of subunits and has the appearance of a jellyfish: its body consists of a double beta-barrel assembly with six long tentacle-like coiled coils protruding from it. Using the tentacles, prefoldin captures an unfolded protein substrate and transfers it to a group II chaperonin. The prefoldin-group II chaperonin system is thought to be important for the folding of newly synthesized proteins and for their maintenance, or proteostasis, in the cytosol. Based on structural information of archaeal prefoldins, the mechanisms of substrate recognition and prefoldin-chaperonin cooperation have been investigated. In contrast, the role and mechanism of eukaryotic PFDs remain unknown. Recent studies have shown that prefoldin plays an important role in proteostasis and is involved in various diseases.

The risk of such bias is greater when the exposure and health outcome are assessed closely in time, when physiological differences are large relative to variability in environmental levels, and when the physiological determinant has diverse functions and implications.

In the aerospace industry, ice accretion has led to a large number of casualties and costs the industry billions of dollars every year. To design effective anti-/de-icing systems, the adhesion of ice to surfaces must be understood. In this review paper, the authors surveyed for papers providing methods for the measurement of ice adhesion. 113 papers were identified for comparison, with data being extracted from 58 papers with common test surfaces (aluminum, steel, Teflon® (Chemours), and polyurethane). The methods used were categorized and data were compared based on their precision and the trends they demonstrated. Conceptual problems were identified with the tests used in the literature and discussed, and open questions relevant to testing the adhesion of ice were identified. Several key parameters affecting ice adhesion identified from the literature were temperature, surface roughness, strain rate, and impact velocity. Their effects on adhesion strength were discussed. While researching this topic, it was discovered that many papers did not report the strain rate in their tests, and the vast majority of papers did not correct their data for stress concentrations on the surface, either of which has been shown to cause variation in the data by one order of magnitude. Data compared from the literature typically spanned one to three orders of magnitude. The causes of these variations were discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adhesion; Aerospace industry; Ice problems; Paper; Strain rate; Surface roughness; Anti/de-icing; Conceptual problems; Critical review; Impact velocities; Review papers; Solid substrates; Technical fields; Three orders of magnitude; Ice"

Studies have shown that perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are routinely detected in landfill leachate, with short chain (C4-C7) PFAAs being most abundant, possibly indicating their greater mobility, and reflecting the industrial shift towards shorter-chain compounds. Despite its restricted use, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) remains one of the most abundant PFAAs in landfill leachates. Recent studies have also documented the presence of PFAA-precursors (e.g., saturated and unsaturated fluorotelomer carboxylic acids) in landfill leachates at concentrations comparable to, or higher than, the most frequently detected PFAAs. Landfill ambient air also contains elevated concentrations of PFASs, primarily semi-volatile precursors (e.g., fluorotelomer alcohols) compared to upwind control sites, suggesting that landfills are potential sources of atmospheric PFASs. The fate of PFASs inside landfills is controlled by a combination of biological and abiotic processes, with biodegradation releasing most of the PFASs from landfilled waste to leachate. Biodegradation in simulated anaerobic reactors has been found to be closely related to the methanogenic phase. The methane-yielding stage also results in higher pH (>7) of leachates, correlated with higher mobility of PFAAs. Little information exists regarding PFAA-precursors in landfills. To avoid significant underestimation of the total PFAS released from landfills, PFAA-precursors and their degradation products should be determined in future studies. Owing to the semi-volatile nature of some precursor compounds and their degradation products, future studies also need to include landfill gas to clarify degradation pathways and the overall fate of PFASs.

Their influence on every realm of biomedicine is established and progressively increasing. The impact of environment on human health is enormous. Among environmental risk factors impinging on quality of life are those of chemical nature (toxic chemicals, heavy metals, pollutants, and pesticides) as well as those related to everyday life such as exposure to noise or mental and psychosocial stress. Recent Advances: This review elaborates on the relationship between miRNAs and these environmental risk factors. Critical Issues: The most relevant facts underlying the role of miRNAs in the response to these environmental stressors, including redox regulatory changes and oxidative stress, are highlighted and discussed. In the cases wherein miRNA mutations are relevant for this response, the pertinent literature is also reviewed. Future Directions: We conclude that, even though in some cases important advances have been made regarding close correlations between specific miRNAs and biological responses to environmental risk factors, a need for prospective large-cohort studies is likely necessary to establish causative roles.

Recent decades brought in water management an intense progress in Advance Oxidation Processes, based on decomposition of pollutants by free radicals, which can be produced in different ways. This review presents the recent advances in those methods for decomposition of the most commonly occurring PFCs in the natural environment – perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS).

This review summarizes and discusses the patterns and trends of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and mercury in ringed seals (Pusa hispida) and polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in the Eastern Canadian Arctic relative to the rest of the Canadian Arctic. The review provides explanations for these trends and looks at the implications of climate-related changes on contaminants in these marine mammals in a region that has been reviewed little. Presently, the highest levels of total mercury (THg) and the legacy pesticide HCH in ringed seals and polar bears are found in the Western Canadian Arctic relative to other locations. Whereas, highest levels of some legacy contaminants, including ∑ PCBs, PCB 153, ∑ DDTs, p,p′-DDE, ∑ CHLs, ClBz are found in the east (i.e., Ungava Bay and Labrador) and in the Beaufort Sea relative to other locations. The highest levels of recent contaminants, including PBDEs and PFOS are found at lower latitudes. Feeding ecology (e.g., feeding at a higher trophic position) is shaping the elevated levels of THg and some legacy contaminants in the west compared to the east. Spatial and temporal trends for POPs and THg are underpinned by historical loadings of surface ocean reservoirs including the Western Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean. Trends set up by the distribution of water masses across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago are then acted upon locally by on-going atmospheric deposition, which is the dominant contributor for more recent contaminants. Warming and continued decline in sea ice are likely to result in further shifts in food web structure, which are likely to increase contaminant burdens in marine mammals. Monitoring of seawater and a range of trophic levels would provide a better basis to inform communities about contaminants in traditionally harvested foods, allow us to understand the causes of contaminant trends in marine ecosystems, and to track environmental response to source controls instituted under international conventions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Chlorine compounds; Contamination; Ecosystems; Impurities; Mammals; Marine pollution; Mercury (metal); Mercury compounds; Meteorological problems; Oceanography; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Reservoirs (water); Sea ice; Canadian Arctic; Canadian Arctic Archipelago; International conventions; Marine environment; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Persistent organic pollutants; Spatial and temporal trends; Spatial trends; Organic pollutants; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 2,2',4,4',5,5' hexachlorobiphenyl; campheclor; chlordane; chlorphenotane; dieldrin; hexachlorobenzene; lindane; mercury; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; chlorphenotane; diphenyl ether derivative; mercury; pentabromodiphenyl ether; pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl; bear; bioaccumulation; ecosystem response; food web; marine pollution; mercury (element); organohalogen; persistent organic pollutant; pinniped; sea ice; trend analysis; warming; Arctic; atmospheric deposition; Canada; climate; feeding ecology; fish; food web; invertebrate; latitude; nonhuman; persistent organic pollutant; Pinnipedia; polar bear; priority journal; Review; ringed seal; sea ice; trend study; trophic level; warming; analysis; animal; aquatic species; Atlantic Ocean; bear; environmental monitoring; food chain; Newfoundland and Labrador; Phocidae; pollutant; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Canada; Canadian Arctic; Mammalia; Phoca hispida; Ursus maritimus; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Arctic Regions; Atlantic Ocean; DDT; Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Food Chain; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Mercury; Newfoundland and Labrador; Pesticides; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Seals, Earless; Ursidae"

In many archaeal species, however, division is orchestrated differently. The Crenarchaeota phylum of archaea features the action of the three proteins, CdvABC. This Cdv system is a unique and less-well-studied division mechanism that merits closer inspection. In vivo, the three Cdv proteins form a composite band that contracts concomitantly with the septum formation. Of the three Cdv proteins, CdvA is the first to be recruited to the division site, while CdvB and CdvC are thought to participate in the active part of the Cdv division machinery. Interestingly, CdvB shares homology with a family of proteins from the eukaryotic ESCRT-III complex, and CdvC is a homolog of the eukaryotic Vps4 complex. These two eukaryotic complexes are key factors in the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway, which is responsible for various budding processes in eukaryotic cells and which participates in the final stages of division in Metazoa. There, ESCRT-III forms a contractile machinery that actively cuts the membrane, whereas Vps4, which is an ATPase, is necessary for the turnover of the ESCRT membrane-abscission polymers. In contrast to CdvB and CdvC, CdvA is unique to the archaeal Crenarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota phyla. The Crenarchaeota division mechanism has often been suggested to represent a simplified version of the ESCRT division machinery thus providing a model system to study the evolution and mechanism of cell division in higher organisms. However, there are still many open questions regarding this parallelism and the division mechanism of Crenarchaeota. Here, we review the existing data on the role of the Cdv proteins in the division process of Crenarchaeota as well as concisely review the ESCRT system in eukaryotes. We survey the similarities and differences between the division and abscission mechanisms in the two cases. We suggest that the Cdv system functions differently in archaea than ESCRT does in eukaryotes, and that, unlike the eukaryotic case, the Cdv system's main function may be related to surplus membrane invagination and cell-wall synthesis. © 2018 Caspi and Dekker.","adenosine triphosphatase; cdv protein; ESCRT protein; Gag protein; protein; unclassified drug; abscission; archaeon; bacterial cell wall; biogenesis; cell division; chromosome; Crenarchaeota; crystal structure; cytokinesis; Desulfurococcales; Euryarchaeota; immunofluorescence; metagenomics; Metallosphaera sedula; microbial community; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; protein interaction; protein localization; protein structure; Review; Sulfolobales; Sulfolobus acidocaldarius; Thaumarchaeota; ubiquitination"

Human exposures to PFASs are nearly ubiquitous globally, but studies that addressed potential health effects of PFASs have only begun to accumulate in recent years. Animal studies suggest adverse effects resulting from developmental encompasses prenatal exposures to PFASs. In humans, the developing fetus is exposed to PFASs via active or passive placenta transfer, while newborns might be exposed via breastfeeding or PFAS in the home environment. Summary: Overall, epidemiological findings are consistent and suggest possible associations with fetal and postnatal growth and immune function, while the findings on neurodevelopmental endpoints to date are rather inconclusive.

It is a complex multifaceted injury affecting initially the airway; however, in short time, it can become a complex life-threatening systemic disease affecting every organ in the body. In this review, we provide a summary of the underlying pathophysiology of organ dysfunction and provide an up-to-date survey of the various critical care modalities that have been found beneficial in caring for these patients. Major pathophysiological change is development of edema in the respiratory tract. The tracheobronchial tree is injured by steam and toxic chemicals, leading to bronchoconstriction. Lung parenchyma is damaged by the release of proteolytic elastases, leading to release of inflammatory mediators, increase in transvascular flux of fluids, and development of pulmonary edema and atelectasis. Decreased levels of surfactant and immunomodulators such as interleukins and tumor-necrosis-factor-α accentuate the injury. A primary survey is conducted at the site of fire, to ensure adequate airway, breathing, and circulation. A good intravenous access is obtained for the administration of resuscitation fluids. Early intubation, preferably with fiberoptic bronchoscope, is prudent before development of airway edema. Bronchial hygiene is maintained, which involves therapeutic coughing, chest physiotherapy, deep breathing exercises, and early ambulation.

Furthermore, despite the advances in treatment technologies, the design of existing treatment plants are not suited to remove these ECs, in addition to there being a lack of published health standards that provide guideline in treating these pollutants. Many new ECs are being introduced into the environment without detection. In these context, this paper reviews existing research that provide reliable and quantitative information on pharmaceuticals, PCPs and EDCs and their concentrations in surface water, ground water, drinking water and treated wastewater and the removal efficiency of different treatment processes for different emerging pollutants, with a focus on recent studies regarding the fate and behavior of the contaminants in wastewater treatment plants and in the environment as well.

Now widespread in human populations and in the environment, several PFASs are also present in remote regions of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of PFASs are not well understood. Phasing out the manufacture of some types of PFASs started in 2000 and further regulatory and voluntary actions have followed. The objective of this review is to understand the effects of these actions on global scale PFAS concentrations. Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations were performed in bibliographic databases, on the internet, through stakeholder contacts and in review bibliographies. No time, document type, language or geographical constraints were applied in the searches. Relevant subjects included human and environmental samples. Two authors screened all retrieved articles. Dual screening of 10% of the articles was performed at title/abstract and full-text levels by all authors. Kappa tests were used to test consistency. Relevant articles were critically appraised by four reviewers, with double checking of 20% of the articles by a second reviewer. Meta-analysis of included temporal trends was considered but judged to not be appropriate. The trends were therefore discussed in a narrative synthesis. Results: Available evidence suggests that human concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) generally are declining, while previously increasing concentrations of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) have begun to level off. Rapid declines for PFOS-precursors (e.g. perfluorooctane sulfonamide, FOSA) have also been consistently observed in human studies. In contrast, limited data indicate that human concentrations of PFOS and PFOA are increasing in China where the production of these substances has increased. Human concentrations of longer-chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) with 9-14 carbon atoms are generally increasing or show insignificant trends with too low power to detect a trend. For abiotic and biological environmental samples there are no clear patterns of declining trends. Most substances show mixed results, and a majority of the trends are insignificant with low power to detect a trend. Conclusions: For electrochemically derived PFASs, including PFOS and PFOA, most human studies in North America and Europe show consistent statistically significant declines. This contrasts with findings in wildlife and in abiotic environmental samples, suggesting that declining PFOS, PFOS-precursor and PFOA concentrations in humans likely resulted from removal of certain PFASs from commercial products including paper and board used in food packaging. Increasing concentrations of long-chain PFCAs in most matrices, and in most regions, is likely due to increased use of alternative PFASs. Continued temporal trend monitoring in the environment with well-designed studies with high statistical power are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of past and continuing regulatory mitigation measures. For humans, more temporal trend studies are needed in regions where manufacturing is most intense, as the one human study available in China is much different than in North America or Europe. © 2018 The Author(s).",

Many countries, especially in remote regional areas, use waste stabilisation ponds (WSPs) to treat domestic wastewater for a variety of end uses, including using the treated wastewater for irrigation of public spaces (e.g. parks and ovals) or for crop irrigation. Thus, it is vital that the resulting effluent meets the required quality for beneficial reuse. In this paper, both the performance of WSPs in the removal of organic micropollutants, and the mechanisms of removal, are reviewed. The performance of WSPs in the removal of organic micropollutants was found to be highly variable and influenced by many factors, such as the type and configuration of the ponds, the operational parameters of the treatment plant, the wastewater quality, environmental factors (e.g. sunlight, temperature, redox conditions and pH) and the characteristics of the pollutant. The removal of organic micropollutants from WSPs has been attributed to biodegradation, photodegradation and sorption processes, the majority of which occur in the initial treatment stages (e.g. in the anaerobic or facultative ponds). Out of the many hundreds of organic micropollutants identified in wastewater, only a limited number (40) have been studied in WSPs, with the majority of these pollutants being pharmaceuticals, personal care products and endocrine disrupting compounds. Thus, future research on the fate of organic micropollutants in WSPs should encompass a broader range of micropollutants and include emerging organic pollutants, such as illicit drugs and perfluorinated compounds. Further research is also needed on the formation and toxicity of transformation products from organic micropollutants in WSPs, since the transformation products of some organic micropollutants can be more toxic than the parent compound. Combining other wastewater treatment processes with WSPs for removal of recalcitrant organic micropollutants should also be considered. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","endocrine disruptor; organic compound; perfluoro compound; pesticide; biodegradation; developing world; domestic waste; effluent; endocrine disruptor; environmental factor; irrigation; organic pollutant; photodegradation; pollutant removal; pond; PPCP; recycling; sorption; waste treatment; wastewater treatment; adsorption; biodegradation; human; nonhuman; organic pollution; photodegradation; pond; Review; waste component removal; waste stabilization pond; waste water management; pond; sewage; waste water; water management; water pollutant; Ponds; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification"

Many studies so far described declining sperm counts, genital malformations, early puberty onset, highlighting the negative impact on reproduction caused by the exposure to many anthropogenic chemicals. In the last years, increasing evidence suggested that these compounds, other than altering reproduction, affect metabolism and induce the onset of obesity and metabolic disorders. According to the “environmental obesogens” hypothesis, evidence exists that exposure to potential EDCs during critical periods when adipocytes are differentiating, and organs are developing, can induce diseases that manifest later in the life. This review summarizes the effects occurring at the hepatic level in different animal models, describing morphological alterations and changes of molecular pathways elicited by the toxicant exposure. Results currently available demonstrated that these chemicals impair normal metabolic processes via interaction with members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, including steroid hormone receptors, thyroid hormone receptors, retinoid X receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, liver X receptors, and farnesoid X receptors. In addition, novel results revealed that EDC exposure can either affect circadian rhythms as well as up-regulate the expression of signals belonging to the endocannabinoid system, in both cases leading to a remarkable increase of lipid accumulation. These results warrant further research and increase the interest toward the identification of new mechanisms for EDC metabolic alterations. The last part of this review article condenses recent evidences on the ability of potential EDCs to cause “transgenerational effects” by a single prenatal or early life exposure. On this regard, there is compelling evidence that epigenetic modifications link developmental environmental insults to adult disease susceptibility. This review will contribute to summarize the mechanisms underlying the insurgence of EDC-induced metabolic alterations as well as to build integrated strategies for their better management. In fact, despite the large number of results obtained so far, there is still a great demand for the development of frameworks that can integrate mechanistic and toxicological/epidemiological observations. This would increase legal and governmental institution awareness on this critical environmental issue responsible for negative consequences in both wild species and human health.

Due to the increment in human consumption, the need for water resources is increasing, and it is estimated that more than 40% of the population worldwide will face water stress/scarcity within the next few decades. Water recycling and reuse may offer the opportunity to expand water resources. For that, the wastewater treatment paradigm should be changed and adequately treated wastewater should be seen as a valuable resource instead of a waste product. It is easily understandable that the exact composition and constituent concentration of wastewater vary according to its different sources (industrial, agricultural, urban usage of water). Consequently, a variety of known and emerging pollutants like heavy metals, antibiotics, pesticides, phthalates, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated compounds and endocrine disruptors have been found in natural water reservoirs, due to the limited effectiveness of conventional wastewater treatment. The conventional approach consists of a combination of physical, chemical and biological processes, aiming at the removal of large sediments such as heavier solids, scum and grease and of organic content in order to avoid the growth of microorganisms and eutrophication of the receiving water bodies. However, this approach is not sufficient to reduce the chemical pollutants and much less the emerging chemical pollutants. In this review, after some considerations concerning chemical pollutants and the problematic efficiency of their removal by conventional methods, an update is presented on the successes and challenges of novel approaches for wastewater remediation based on advanced oxidation processes.

This paper descibes an asymmetric synthesis of unnatural amino acid derivatives and their subsequent application to the preparation of unnatural amino acid-containing peptides. The α-imino carboxylic acid derivatives, which are common substrates for the synthesis of unnatural amino acids, could be readily prepared by MnO 2 -mediated oxidation of N-PMP-protected glycine derivatives. This reaction allowed us to synthesize novel derivatives such as α-imino perfluoroalkylesters, imides or thioesters. These compounds are useful for the synthesis of unnatural amino acid derivatives. MnO 2 -mediated oxidation was further applied to the synthesis of peptidyl imine. Moreover, a new methodology for the synthesis of unnatural amino acid-containing peptides was developed using the thus obtained imino peptides. This novel approach should be useful for the divergent synthesis of peptides possessing varieties of unnatural amino acid moieties. © 2018 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.","amino acid; amino acid derivative; carboxylic acid; ester; glycine derivative; imide; peptide; amino acid; glycine; imine; manganese derivative; manganese dioxide; oxide; peptide; asymmetric synthesis; biological activity; chemical reaction; oxidation; peptide synthesis; Review; analogs and derivatives; catalysis; chemistry; oxidation reduction reaction; protein motif; synthesis; Amino Acid Motifs; Amino Acids; Catalysis; Esters; Glycine; Imides; Imines; Manganese Compounds; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxides; Peptides"

However, few studies have evaluated the effect of this exposure on cardiometabolic risk factors in preschool-age children. The health and disease development paradigm (DOHaD) proposes that the physiological and metabolic adaptations triggered by the exposure to these compounds, coupled with postnatal conditions, can modify the risk of disease. In this context, cardiometabolic risk factors in children are not only an important outcome derived from prenatal exposure but a predictor/mediator of the children’s future health. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the evidence published in the last 10 years from cohort studies on the association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and cardiometabolic risk factors in preschoolers. Design: Studies published from January 1, 2007 to May 1, 2017 in PubMed were analyzed. The research strategy was based on specified keywords and following the application of strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, 16 studies were identified and reviewed. Data were extracted and aspects of quality were assessed using an adapted Newcastle–Ottawa scale for cohort studies. Results: Only 5 of the 16 studies reviewed analyzed cardiometabolic risk factors in addition to anthropometric measures in children. The cohort studies included in this review suggest that prenatal exposure to low concentrations of EDCs has an impact on anthropometric variables and biochemical parameters in preschool-age children. Positive associations between prenatal exposure to EDCs and percentage of fat mass, body mass index, waist circumference, skinfolds and risk of overweight persisted after adjustment for important confounding variables. No association was found with lipid profile and glucose levels. Conclusions: Evidence was found to suggest that prenatal exposure to EDCs is positively associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in preschool children. © 2018 The Author(s).","1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 2,5 dichlorophenol; adiponectin; arsenic; C reactive protein; cadmium; cholesterol; endocrine disruptor; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lead; leptin; mercury; oxybenzone; perfluorooctane; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; phthalic acid derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; triclosan; endocrine disruptor; abdominal circumference; anthropometric parameters; body height; body mass; body weight; cardiometabolic risk; child; childhood obesity; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; diastolic blood pressure; fat mass; female; glucose level; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; human; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; prenatal exposure; preschool child; Review; skinfold thickness; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; waist circumference; waist to height ratio; cardiovascular disease; child health; metabolic disorder; pregnancy; prevention and control; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child Health; Child, Preschool; Endocrine Disruptors; Female; Humans; Metabolic Diseases; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"

Methods: We searched several medical literature data bases with the following key words: ""oral allergy syndrome,"" ""OAS,"" ""pollen-food allergy syndrome,"" ""PFAS,"" ""allergy,"" ""diagnosis,"" ""treatment."" Results: Oral allergy syndrome (OAS), also called ""pollen-food allergy syndrome,"" is a type of food allergy brought about by flavors, nuts, raw fruit, and vegetables. The most well-known symptoms are mouth and throat itching, which starts rapidly after a food is placed in the mouth, and that, as a rule, continues for just a couple of minutes after the food has been swallowed. The frequency of OAS with pollen allergy has been reported as 5-8%; 1-2% of patients with OAS with pollen allergy show extreme responses, e.g., anaphylaxis. Birch tree pollen, ragweed pollen, and grass pollen hypersensitivity cause the symptoms. The diagnosis of OAS is confirmed by a positive history and positive skin-prick test result triggered by the food's fresh extract. Oral challenge result is normally positive with the raw food and negative with the similar cooked food. Conclusion: Patients with grass allergy may have a response to peaches, oranges, celery, tomatoes, and melons. Patients with ragweed allergy may show OAS symptoms with melon, cucumber, banana, and zucchini. Physicians should be aware of OAS and know the appropriate treatment. © Copyright 2018, OceanSide Publications, Inc., U.S.A.","antihistaminic agent; corticosteroid; epinephrine; allergen; breath analysis; cross reaction; food allergy; grass pollen; human; lactose intolerance; nose obstruction; nutritional intolerance; oral allergy syndrome; pollen allergy; prick test; pruritus; ragweed pollen; Review; sneezing; systematic review; voice change; anaphylaxis; animal; birch; eating; food; food allergy; immunology; Poaceae; pollen; pollen allergy; ragweed; skin test; Allergens; Ambrosia; Anaphylaxis; Animals; Betula; Eating; Food; Food Hypersensitivity; Humans; Poaceae; Pollen; Pruritus; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal; Skin Tests"

DU has been hypothesized to represent a hazardous element both for soldiers exposed as well as for the inhabitants of the polluted areas in the war zones. In this review, the possible consequences on human health of DU released in the environment are critically analyzed. In the first part, the chemical properties of DU and the principal civil and military uses are summarized. A concise analysis of the mechanisms underlying absorption, blood transport, tissue distribution and excretion of DU in the human body is the subject of the second part of this article. The following sections deal with pathological condition putatively associated with overexposure to DU. Developmental and birth defects, the Persian Gulf syndrome, and kidney diseases that have been associated to DU are the arguments treated in the third section. Finally, data regarding DU exposure and cancer insurgence will be critically analyzed, including leukemia/lymphoma, lung cancer, uterine cervix cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer and testicular cancer. The aim of the authors is to give a contribution to the debate on DU and its effects on human health and disease. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.","depleted uranium; unclassified drug; uranium; uranium; absorption; bladder cancer; breast cancer; chemical analysis; congenital malformation; disease association; excretion; human; kidney disease; leukemia; lung cancer; lymphoma; Persian Gulf syndrome; Review; testis cancer; tissue distribution; uterine cervix cancer; chemically induced; metabolism; neoplasm; Humans; Neoplasms; Uranium"

With increasing prevalence of NAFLD in both children and adults, an understanding of the factors that promote NAFLD development and progression is crucial. Environmental agents, including endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which have been linked to other diseases, may play a role in NAFLD development. Increasing evidence supports a developmental origin of liver disease, and early-life exposure to EDCs could represent one risk factor for the development of NAFLD later in life. Rodent studies provide the strongest evidence for this link, but further studies are needed to define whether there is a causal link between early-life EDC exposure and NAFLD development in humans. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying development of NAFLD in the context of developmental EDC exposures may identify biomarkers for people at risk, as well as potential intervention and/or therapeutic opportunities for the disease.

Obligate intracellular bacteria replicate exclusively within the interior of living cells, an osmotically protected niche. Under these conditions peptidoglycan is not necessarily needed to maintain the integrity of the bacterial cell. Moreover, the presence of peptidoglycan puts bacteria at risk of detection and destruction by host peptidoglycan recognition factors and downstream effectors. This has resulted in a selective pressure and opportunity to reduce the levels of peptidoglycan. In this review we have analysed the occurrence of genes involved in peptidoglycan metabolism across the major obligate intracellular bacterial species. From this comparative analysis, we have identified a group of predicted ‘peptidoglycan-intermediate’ organisms that includes the Chlamydiae, Orientia tsutsugamushi, Wolbachia and Anaplasma marginale. This grouping is likely to reflect biological differences in their infection cycle compared with peptidoglycan-negative obligate intracellular bacteria such as Ehrlichia and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, as well as obligate intracellular bacteria with classical peptidoglycan such as Coxiella, Buchnera and members of the Rickettsia genus.

The exchange of water between the surface-subsurface generates the hyporheic exchange flow: the engine that drives the ecological functioning of the HZ. The magnitude and direction of hydrological fluxes in the HZ follow complex spatial patterns, strongly influenced by the temporal dynamics of surface flow in rivers.2) The direction and magnitude of hydrological fluxes also shapes the structure of hyporheic communities (hyporheos). During surface disturbances such as flooding or drought, benthic organisms may also use the HZ as a refuge, although the importance of this role is debated.3) Streambed organisms differ in their ability to colonize the HZ depending on the biological traits they possess. The reduction in oxygen concentration and pore size with increasing sediment depth imposes a limit on the distribution of macroinvertebrates, which are replaced by a suite of smaller organisms (meiofauna and protists) at deeper sediment layers. Therefore, a concomitant reduction in net biomass and productivity might be expected through depth. However, only a few studies have assessed the contribution of the hyporheos to whole system production, and they have focused only on the fraction of relatively large organisms.4) The bioreactor ability of the HZ to transform nutrients and pollutants is an important ecosystem service sustained by the life activities of hyporheos. Biofilms have the key role in this process due to their capacity to metabolize a wide range of dissolved compounds, including emerging pollutants. However, the residence time of water in pore sediments (resulting from hyporheic exchange flow) and the rest of the community (constantly reworking the sediments and grazing biofilms) are indirectly involved. © 2017","Biofilms; Biological water treatment; Bioremediation; Ecosystems; Hydrology; Nutrients; Pore size; Residence time distribution; Sediments; Concomitant reduction; Ecological functioning; Ecosystem services; Hyporheic exchange flow; Macroinvertebrates; Meiofauna; Micropollutants; Oxygen concentrations; Stream flow; biofilm; biological production; bioremediation; community ecology; ecosystem service; hydrology; hyporheic zone; macroinvertebrate; meiofauna; nutrient cycling; attenuation; biofilm; biomass; community ecology; drought; flooding; hydrodynamics; hydrology; hyporheic zone; macroinvertebrate; meiofauna; nonhuman; pollutant; priority journal; protist; Review; river; seasonal variation; stream (river); water flow; Protista"

A time-constrained therapeutic window, with the drug to be given within 4.5 h after stroke onset, and lethal side effects associated with delayed treatment, most notably hemorrhagic transformation (HT), limit the clinical use of tPA. Co-administering tPA with other agents, including drug or non-drug interventions, has been proposed as a practical strategy to address the limitations of tPA. Here, we discuss the pharmacological and non-drug approaches that were examined to mitigate the complications—especially HT—associated with delayed tPA treatment. The pharmacological treatments include those that preserve the blood-brain barrier (e.g., atovarstatin, batimastat, candesartan, cilostazol, fasudil, minocycline, etc.), enhance vascularization and protect the cerebrovasculature (e.g., coumarin derivate IMM-H004 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)), and exert their effects through other modes of action (e.g., oxygen transporters, ascorbic acid, etc.). The non-drug approaches include stem cell treatments and gas therapy with multi-pronged biological effects. Co-administering tPA with the abovementioned therapies showed promise in attenuating delayed tPA-induced side effects and stroke-induced neurological and behavioral deficits. Thus, adjunctive treatment approach is an innovative therapeutic modality that can address the limitations of tPA treatment and potentially expand the time window for ischemic stroke therapy. © 2017 by the authors.

The thyroid is very sensitive to the action of disruptors, and considering the importance of a correct thyroid function for physical and cognitive functioning, addressing this topic should be considered a priority. In this review, we examined the most recent studies, many of them concentrating on maternal and child exposure, conducted to assess the impact of industrial chemicals which showed an influence on thyroid function. So far, the number of studies conducted on that topic is not sufficient to provide solid conclusions and lead to homogeneous guidelines. The lack of uniformity is certainly due to differences in areas and populations examined, the different conditions of exposures and the remarkable inter-subject variability.

The complement system has an established role in the pathogenesis of MS, and evidence suggests that its components can be used as biomarkers of disease-state activity and response to treatment in MS. Plasma C4a levels have been found to be significantly elevated in patients with active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), as compared to both controls and patients with stable RRMS. C3 levels are also significantly elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with RRMS, and C3 levels are correlated with clinical disability. Furthermore, increased levels of factor H can predict the transition from relapsing to progressive disease, since factor H levels have been found to increase progressively with disease progression over a 2-year period in patients transitioning from RRMS to secondary progressive (SP) MS. In addition, elevations in C3 are seen in primary progressive (PP) MS. Complement components can also differentiate RRMS from neuromyelitis optica. Response gene to complement (RGC)-32, a novel molecule induced by complement activation, is a possible biomarker of relapse and response to glatiramer acetate (GA) therapy, since RGC-32 mRNA expression is significantly decreased during relapse and increased in responders to GA treatment. The predictive accuracy of RGC-32 as a potential biomarker (by ROC analysis) is 90% for detecting relapses and 85% for detecting a response to GA treatment.

Those molecular alterations can be found in the bloodstream, which suggests that we could quantify specific biomarkers in plasma or serum by very sensitive methods before the onset diabetes mellitus is diagnosed. However, classical methods of protein analysis such as electrophoresis, Western blot, ELISA, and liquid chromatography are generally time-consuming, lab-intensive, and not sensitive enough to detect such alteration in a pre-symptomatic state of the disease. Method A very sensitive and novel analytical detection conjugate system by using the combination of polyfluorophor technology with protein microchip method was developed. Results This innovative system facilitates the use of a very sensitive microchip assays that measure selected biomarkers in a small sample volume (10 μL) with a much higher sensitivity (92%) compare to common immune assay systems. Further advances of the application of this technology combine the power of miniaturization and faster quantification (around 10 min). Conclusion The power of this technology offers great promise for point-of-care clinical testing and monitoring of specific biomarkers for diabetes in femtogram level in serum or plasma. In conclusion, the results indicate that the technical performance of this new technology is valid and that the assay is able to quantified PPY-specific antigens in plasma at femtogram levels which can be used for identification of beta cell dysfunction at the pre-symptomatic stage of diabetes mellitus. © European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA) 2017.","biopsy technique; biotechnology; cell damage; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic equipment; diagnostic error; diagnostic test; diagnostic value; disease course; disease marker; human; immunoassay; in vitro diagnostic assay; in vitro study; laboratory diagnosis; measurement; microchip analysis; miniaturization; molecular biology; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; point of care testing; private health insurance; protein determination; public health insurance; Review; sensitivity and specificity; symptom"

The possible health impacts of exposure to highly fluorinated chemicals are of great concern to communities whose water has been impacted. Community members want information, and are asking for biomonitoring, exposure pathway analysis, and health studies. Governmental agencies are striving to deal with these multiple concerns in the face of information and resource constraints. We propose the development of a high-level research strategy to maximize what can be learned about health effects of highly fluorinated chemicals and methods to reduce or eliminate exposure.

While there is considerable evidence of implementation initiatives in direct care context, there is limited investigation of implementation initiatives in decision-making context as it relates to program planning, service delivery and developing policies. Research has also shown a gap in consistent application of system-level strategies that can effectively translate organizational policies around patient and family engagement into practice. Methods: The broad objective of this initiative was to develop a system-level implementation strategy to include patient and family advisors (PFAs) at decision-making points in primary healthcare (PHC) based on well-established evidence and literature. In this opportunity sponsored by the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement (CFHI) a co-design methodology, also well-established was applied in identifying and developing a suitable implementation strategy to engage PFAs as members of quality teams in PHC. Diabetes management centres (DMCs) was selected as the pilot site to develop the strategy. Key steps in the process included review of evidence, review of the current state in PHC through engagement of key stakeholders and a co-design approach. Results: The project team included a diverse representation of members from the PHC system including patient advisors, DMC team members, system leads, providers, Public Engagement team members and CFHI improvement coaches. Key outcomes of this 18-month long initiative included development of a working definition of patient and family engagement, development of a Patient and Family Engagement Resource Guide and evaluation of the resource guide. Conclusion: This novel initiative provided us an opportunity to develop a supportive system-wide implementation plan and a strategy to include PFAs in decision-making processes in PHC. The well-established co-design methodology further allowed us to include value-based (customer driven quality and experience of care) perspectives of several important stakeholders including patient advisors. The next step will be to implement the strategy within DMCs, spread the strategy PHC, both locally and provincially with a focus on sustainability. © 2017 The Author(s); Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.","Canada; decision making; diabetes mellitus; family; human; information processing; organization and management; patient participation; patient satisfaction; primary health care; procedures; professional-patient relationship; Canada; Decision Making; Diabetes Mellitus; Family; Focus Groups; Humans; Patient Participation; Patient Satisfaction; Primary Health Care; Professional-Patient Relations"

This review shows that in the crystal structures of fluorinated derivatives of the Group 15 atoms, close contacts between Group 15 atoms and negative sites (e.g. lone pair possessing atoms and anions) are quite common. These close contacts are taken as indications of attractive interactions. The collection of single crystal X-ray structures analysed in this paper demonstrates that the ability of fluorinated atoms of Group 15 to work as electrophilic sites, namely to function as pnictogen bond donors, is fairly general. The directionalities and separations of these pninctogen bonds are convincing experimental evidences that linking a fluorine to a pnictogen atom increases its electrophilicity to the point that pnictogen bonding formation may become a determinant of the lattice structures in crystalline solids. Pnictogen bonding formation may become an heuristic principle for predicting some of the short contacts that are present in the crystal structures of compounds containing fluorinated atoms of Group 15, particularly when polyfluorinated. Pnictogen derivatives containing other moieties may also work as effective electrophilic sites and a convenient design of the used tectons may allow pnictogen bond to become a general and reliable tool in crystal engineering. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

Currently, data on the associations between exposure to POPs and the risk of mortality in the U.S. population is limited. Our objective was to determine if higher exposure to POPs is associated with greater risk of all-cause, cancer, heart/cerebrovascular disease, or other-cause mortality. Methods: Analyses included participants aged 60 years and older from the 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). We included 483 participants for analyses of PBDEs, 1043 for PFASs, and 461 for PCBs, and 1428 for OC pesticides. Exposures to POPs were estimated using biomarkers measured in serum. Mortality status through December 31, 2011 was obtained from public-use, linked mortality files. We used Cox proportional hazard models to quantify the associations of interest. Where we observed an association, we explored effect modification by sex, body mass index, smoking status, and albuminuria. We also explored the combined effect of PBDEs and OC pesticides in the subsample of participants with measures of both analytes. Results: Serum measurements of PBDEs, PFASs, and PCBs were not clearly associated with increased all-cause or cause-specific mortality in older Americans. Beta-hexachlorocyclohexane was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality [HR per 1 SD increase =1.18, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.38]. Oxychlordane [HR = 1.15 95% CI 1.06, 1.25], p,p'-DDE [HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.23], trans-nonachlor [HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.18], and beta-hexachlorocyclohexane [HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.52] were associated with increased risk of other-cause mortality. Exploratory analyses suggested associations between OC pesticides and other-cause mortality were modified by sex. Exploratory analyses also suggested that the combination of high PBDE and high OC pesticide exposure had a stronger than expected adverse effect on all-cause mortality. Conclusion: Higher exposure to beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, an OC pesticide, is associated with increased all-cause mortality and higher exposure to four OC pesticides is associated with increased non-cancer, non-heart/cerebrovascular disease mortality in U.S. adults 60 years or older.

Their triacylglycerols (MCT) can be absorbed intact into intestinal epithelial enterocytes and then hydrolysed by microsomal lipases. Thus they are a readily available source of energy, capable of improving the intestinal epithelial mucosal structure. They are also characterised by strong antibacterial activity due to their ability to penetrate the semi-permeable membranes of bacteria and damage their internal structures. Thanks to these properties, they could be a good supplement to weaned piglet feed.

In this article, we review recent advances in the use of hydrogenated-fluorinated surfactant mixtures to achieve interfacial patterning. For even relatively simple systems comprised of binary mixed monolayers of hydrogenated and perfluorinated fatty acids, a diverse range of film morphologies can be generated at the air-water interface and successfully transferred onto solid substrates. Systematic investigations reported over the past several years have allowed for correlation between the chemical structure of the film constituents with the gross film morphology and underlying crystalline structure of the films. Early thermodynamic models based on the interplay between dipole-dipole repulsion forces between charged headgroups balanced by line tension between phases that were formulated to describe phase-behavior in simple phospholipid monolayer systems have proven highly useful to describe morphologies for the immiscible surfactant blends. Beyond simple binary fatty acid mixtures, highly-structured films have also been reported in mixed phospholipid systems, which have found important application in controlling the physical, compositional and performance properties of lung surfactant mixtures, as well as in semifluorinated alkane monolayers which form unique, hemimicellar structures at both liquid and solid interfaces. We also describe advances in using these approaches to pattern photopolymerizable, luminescent surfactants, which have found extensive use in colorimetric and fluorometric sensing devices. The long-term outlook for this field, with an emphasis on potential applications and future research directions are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Air; Binary mixtures; Bins; Fatty acids; Fluorocarbons; Hydrogenation; Interfaces (materials); Mixtures; Monolayers; Morphology; Phase separation; Phospholipids; Separation; Surface active agents; Crystalline structure; Fluorinated surfactant; Future research directions; Patterning; Performance properties; Phospholipid monolayers; Semifluorinated alkanes; Surfactant monolayers; Phase interfaces"

The entry of those chemicals to water bodies occurs mainly through the sewage effluents from wastewater treatment plants due to their incomplete or inefficient removal. The purpose of this review was to collect and analyze data about the incidence and concentrations of PCPs reported as emerging pollutants in different water matrices, including wastewater influents and effluents. Our database is composed of 141 articles with information about 72 PCPs recorded as emerging pollutants in 30 countries, in concentrations ranging from 0.029 ng/L to 7.811 × 106 ng/L. Fragrances, antiseptics and sunscreens were the most reported groups. As expected, the largest number of PCPs documented as emerging pollutants were found in wastewater treatment plant effluents with a total of 64 compounds, compared to 43 in surface water and 23 in groundwater, which evidence the anthropological contribution of PCPs to water bodies. These molecules were found in all the continents, however, there is a lack of information regarding the presence of emerging pollutants from PCPs in developing countries.

Compared with transient free radicals, environmental persistent free radicals have received relatively less attention, and the generating mechanisms and environmental impacts remain unclear. Meanwhile, environmental persistent free radicals are widely distributed in the environment, which makes them more complex in their research. This review highlights EPFRs from the following aspects: detection methods, generating mechanisms, speciation types, environmental characteristics (persistence, stability, and reactivity), the harm to the environment and the elimination method. By studying the fate behaviors of environmental persistent free radicals, this article proposes a possible migration pathway in environment.

Its agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, exhibits multiple mechanisms to evade the host immune response and infect host cells. An important immune evasion strategy of T. cruzi infective stages is its capacity to inhibit the complement system activation on the parasite surface, avoiding opsonizing, immune stimulating and lytic effects. Epimastigotes, the non-infective form of the parasite, present in triatomine arthropod vectors, are highly susceptible to complement-mediated lysis while trypomastigotes, the infective form, present in host bloodstream, are resistant. Thus T. cruzi susceptibility to complement varies depending on the parasite stage (amastigote, trypomastigotes or epimastigote) and on the T. cruzi strain. To avoid complement-mediated lysis, T. cruzi trypomastigotes express on the parasite surface a variety of complement regulatory proteins, such as glycoprotein 58/68 (gp58/68), T. cruzi complement regulatory protein (TcCRP), trypomastigote decay-accelerating factor (T-DAF), C2 receptor inhibitor trispanning (CRIT) and T. cruzi calreticulin (TcCRT). Alternatively, or concomitantly, the parasite captures components with complement regulatory activity from the host bloodstream, such as factor H (FH) and plasma membrane-derived vesicles (PMVs). All these proteins inhibit different steps of the classical (CP), alternative (AP) or lectin pathways (LP). Thus, TcCRP inhibits the CP C3 convertase assembling, gp58/68 inhibits the AP C3 convertase, T-DAF interferes with the CP and AP convertases assembling, TcCRT inhibits the CP and LP, CRIT confers ability to resist the CP and LP, FH is used by trypomastigotes to inhibit the AP convertases and PMVs inhibit the CP and LP C3 convertases. Many of these proteins have similar molecular inhibitory mechanisms. Our laboratory has contributed to elucidate the role of TcCRT in the host-parasite interplay. Thus, we have proposed that TcCRT is a pleiotropic molecule, present not only in the parasite endoplasmic reticulum, but also on the trypomastigote surface, participating in key processes to establish T. cruzi infection, such as inhibition of the complement system and serving as an important virulence factor. Additionally, TcCRT interaction with key complement components, participates as an anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor molecule, inhibiting at least in important part, tumor growth in infected animals. © 2017 Ramírez-Toloza and Ferreira.","C2 receptor inhibitor trispanning protein; calreticulin; classical complement pathway C3 C5 convertase; complement component C1; complement component C1q; complement component C3; complement component C5; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement factor H; complement regulatory protein; decay accelerating factor; glycoprotein; glycoprotein 58/68; lectin; membrane protein; sialic acid; transforming growth factor beta; unclassified drug; amastigote; bloodstream infection; cancer inhibition; cell vacuole; complement system; enzyme activity; epimastigote; exosome; host parasite interaction; human; intracellular signaling; nonhuman; phagocytosis; plasma membrane derived vesicle; protein binding; protein expression; Review; Trypanosoma cruzi; trypomastigote"

This drives activation of caspase-1 or caspase-11/4/5, which cleave gasdermin D, separating its N-terminal pore-forming domain (PFD) from the C-terminal repressor domain (RD). The PFD oligomerizes to form large pores in the membrane that drive swelling and membrane rupture. Gasdermin D is one of six (in humans) gasdermin family members; several other gasdermins have also been shown to form pores that cause pyroptosis after cleavage to activate their PFDs. One of these, gasdermin E, is activated by caspase-3 cleavage. We review our current understanding of pyroptosis as well as current knowledge of the gasdermin family. Caspase-1-programmed cell death observed in 1992 was later termed pyroptosis to differentiate it from the morphologically distinct apoptosis. The pyroptosis effector remained unknown until 2015 when gasdermin D was discovered as a cleavage target for caspase-1 and -11. The N terminus of gasdermin D is a PFD that permeabilizes the plasma membrane, simultaneously releasing mature IL-1β and driving cell swelling until membrane rupture. Membrane rupture disperses soluble cytosolic contents. Organelles and intracellular bacteria remain trapped within the torn but largely intact plasma membrane.

Due to the persistent, bioaccumulative, long-range transport and potential toxic behaviors, production of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid was voluntarily phased out. Perfluorooctanoic acid, its salt and related compounds were also proposed to be included the Stockholm Convention. Restrictions on production and usage of PFAS chemicals have resulted in emergence of novel PFAS compounds through direct manufacturing emissions and indirect transformation pathways, and increasing attention has been focused on these alternatives. In this review, we summarized recent investigations on major groups of emerging PFASs with various molecular structures, and current analytical strategies on the identification of unknown organic fluoride components were overviewed. Four classes of emerging PFASs are covered, including short-chain perfluoroalkyl substances, cyclic perfluoroalkyl acids, perfluoropolyethers and chlorine or hydrogen-substituted polyfluoroalkyl substances. Current knowledge on molecular structures, production and application, environmental behaviors and potential biological effects are summarized, if available. Known PFASs were noticed as a small part of organic fluorinated compounds in the environment. Consequently, new analytical strategies, such as the mass balance analysis and the oxidative conversion methods, were developed for the analysis of unknown fluorinated components. Mass balance analysis of extractable organic fluorine were used to predict the content of unknown organic fluorine in various environmental matrices including sea water, soil, and human blood. Extractable organic fluorine could be exactly quantified after conversion into inorganic fluoride by high-temperature combustion, and known fluorinated components could also be measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The difference in contents between extractable organic fluorine and known fluorinated components was thus considered as components of unknown organic fluorine. The oxidative conversion method was especially superior for the analysis of fluorinated precursors such as fluorotelomer sulfonates, perfluoroalkane sulfonamides and fluorotelomer phosphate diesters, in which these poly-fluoroalkyl substances could be transformed into known perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) by reaction with hydroxyl radicals at basic conditions. The content of polyfluoroalkyl precursors could be determined by comparing the change of PFCAs contents before and after the oxidation assay. Compared with the mass balance analysis method, this oxidative conversion method require quantification of more PFAS terminal products, and it was not applicable for stable perfluorinated compounds. Meanwhile, occurrence of a variety of novel PFAS analogues have brought challenges on PFAS analysis. For instance, varied molecular structures of emerging PFASs result in distinct physical-chemical properties, which further complicate the analytical process including sample pretreatment and chromatographic isolation. Development of additional methods, such as hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) for the analysis of short chain PFASs and orthogonal liquid chromatography for the analysis of zwitterionic, cationic, and anionic fluorinated chemicals, are urgently needed. Statistical tools including mass spectrum deconvolution, peak picking, alignment and feature filtering would be promising for confirmation of novel PFAS molecular structures. Also, environmental transformation of PFAS precursors are still ambiguous. Application of strategies in metabolomics analysis might facilitate studies on degradation mechanism of PFAS chemicals. © 2017, Science Press.

The continuous use in the treatment against several bacterial infections paves a way to increased resistant strains. Environmental pollution created by antibiotics is considered as a serious problem though no toxic reports were known until now. The pharmaceutical compounds present in the environment are known as “Emerging Pollutants.” Among antibiotics, tetracycline (TET) class of drugs were known to exist for several years. Within 3–4 years of the discovery of the first class of TET, the resistant strains were also identified. TET usage is not only limited for human therapy but also greatly used in veterinary and agricultural purposes. These compounds have been detected in the environment, especially in aquatic farms, groundwater, surface water, etc., thus, it becomes vital to take some measures in removing these compounds from the ecosystem to some extent. Many degradation methodologies and mechanisms were applied to remove TET but were highly limited to synthetic effluents. Adsorption is a common practice at the industrial level, especially in effluent treatment processes. In this study, removal of TET through adsorption using various adsorbents was reviewed extensively. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adsorbents; Antibiotics; Aquatic ecosystems; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Groundwater; Pollution; River pollution; Water treatment; Adsorption studies; Agricultural purpose; Bacterial infections; Emerging pollutants; Environmental pollutions; Pharmaceutical compounds; Synthetic effluent; Tetracycline; Adsorption"

Such generation systems allow for significant reduction of CO2 emissions compared with a traditional fossil fuel plant. Furthermore, several improvements in power systems network configuration and operation combined with new technologies have enabled reduction of losses and energy demand, thus contributing to reduction of CO2 emissions. Another environmental threat identified in electrical networks is the leaking of insulating sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas used in electrical gas insulated substations (GIS) and equipment. Because of its Global Warming Potential (GWP) of nearly 24,000 and its long life in the atmosphere (over 3000 years), SF6 gas was recognized as a greenhouse gas at the 1997 COP3; since then its use and emissions in the atmosphere have been regulated by international treaties. It is expected that as soon as an alternative insulating gas is found, SF6 use in high-voltage (HV) equipment will be banned. This paper presents an overview of the key research advances made in recent years in the quest to find eco-friendly gases to replace SF6. The review reports the main properties of candidate gases that are being investigated; in particular, natural gases (dry air, N2 or CO2) and polyfluorinated gases especially Trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I), Perfluorinated Ketones, Octafluorotetra-hydrofuran, Hydrofluoroolefin (HFOs), and Fluoronitriles are presented and their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with an emphasis on their dielectric properties (especially their dielectric strength), GWP, and boiling point with respect to the minimum operating temperature for HV power network applications. © 2017 by the authors.","Carbon dioxide; Dielectric properties of gases; Electric network analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Environmental protection; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Gas mixtures; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Insulation; Ketones; Renewable energy resources; Sulfur hexafluoride; Dielectric strengths; Eco-friendly; Fluoronitriles; Global warming potential; Hydrofluoroolefin; Trifluoroiodomethane; SF6 insulation"

In particular, VRFBs offer a higher power and energy density than other RFBs and mitigate undesirable performance fading, such as inevitable ion crossover, because of the unique advantage that only the vanadium ion is employed as the active species in the two electrolytes. Description: The key constituent of VRFBs is a separator to conduct protons and prevent cross-mixing of the positive and negative electrolytes. For this purpose, ion exchange membranes like sulfonated polymer membranes can be used. Although this type of membrane does not have ion exchange groups, it can achieve an ion exchange capacity by the formation of pores.

The currently available colloids vary in their physicochemical, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties. In particular, they differ in molecular weight, which partly determines their duration of action, and in their ability to expand the plasma volume. Dextran, hydroxyethyl starch and hypertonic colloid solutions improve oxygen flux within the microcirculation. Despite their benefits, the use of dextran and high-molecular-weight starches is limited by their negative impact on coagulation.

The hypothesis most widely accepted is that exposure to insults inducing adverse conditions in-utero may have negative effects on the development of target organs, disrupting homeostasis and increasing the risk of diseases at adulthood. Several models have been proposed to investigate the fetal origins of adult diseases, but although these approaches hold true for almost all diseases, particular attention has been focused on disorders related to the central nervous system, since the brain is particularly sensitive to alterations of the microenvironment during early development. Neurobiological disorders can be broadly divided into developmental, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Even though most of these diseases share genetic risk factors, the onset of the disorders cannot be explained solely by inheritance. Therefore, current understanding presumes that the interactions of environmental input, may lead to different disorders. Among the insults that can play a direct or indirect role in the development of neurobiological disorders are stress, infections, drug abuse, and environmental contaminants.

In this review, we summarize the results of investigations of environmental exposures evaluated in 360 free-ranging dolphins between 2003 and 2015. Bottlenose dolphins inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon, Florida (IRL, n = 246), and coastal waters of Charleston, South Carolina (CHS, n = 114), were captured, given comprehensive health examinations, and released as part of a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional study of individual and population health. High concentrations of persistent organic pollutants including legacy contaminants (DDT and other pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl compounds) as well as 'emerging' contaminants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluorinated compounds) were detected in dolphins from CHS, with lower concentrations in the IRL. Conversely, the concentrations of mercury in the blood and skin of IRL dolphins were among the highest reported worldwide and approximately 5 times as high as those found in CHS dolphins. A high prevalence of resistance to antibiotics commonly used in humans and animals was detected in bacteria isolated from fecal, blowhole, and/or gastric samples at both sites, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at CHS.

An extensive search for toxicological information in rats and mice, and a systematic search for epidemiological evidence were conducted. The linear regression coefficient (LRC) of birth weight (BrthW) on PFOA/PFOS was considered, and separate random effects meta-analyses for untransformed (i.e. not mathematically transformed) and log-transformed values were performed. Toxicological evidence: PFOA: 12 studies (21 datasets) in mice showed statistically significant lower birth/fetal weights from 5 mg/kg body weight per day. PFOS: most of the 13 studies (19 datasets) showed lower birth/fetal weights following in utero exposure. Epidemiological evidence: Sixteen articles were considered. The pooled LRC for a 1 ng/mL increase in untransformed PFOA (12 studies) in maternal plasma/serum was −12.8 g (95% CI −23.2; 2.4), and −27.1 g (95% CI −50.6; −3.6) for an increase of 1 loge ng/mL PFOA (nine studies). The pooled LRC for untransformed PFOS (eight studies) was −0.92 g (95%CI −3.4; 1.6), and for an increase of 1 loge ng/mL was −46.1(95% CI −80.3; −11.9). No consistent pattern emerged for study location or timing of blood sampling. Conclusions: Epidemiological and toxicological evidence suggests that PFOA and PFOS elicit a decrease in BrthW both in humans and rodents. However, the effective animal extrapolated serum concentrations are 102–103 times higher than those in humans. Thus, there is no quantitative toxicological evidence to support the epidemiological association, thus reducing the biological plausibility of a causal relationship. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; birth weight; blood level; blood sampling; epidemiological data; fetus; fetus growth; fetus weight; human; linear regression analysis; maternal blood; maternal plasma; medical literature; nonhuman; prenatal exposure; Review; statistical significance; systematic review; animal; drug effects; environmental exposure; epidemiological monitoring; female; fetus development; maternal exposure; mouse; rat; toxicity testing; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Birth Weight; Caprylates; Environmental Exposure; Epidemiological Monitoring; Female; Fetal Development; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Mice; Rats; Toxicity Tests"

We determined that risk of bias across studies was low to moderate. Six categories of health outcomes emerged. These were: immunity/infection/asthma, cardio-metabolic, neurodevelopmental/attention, thyroid, renal, and puberty onset. While there are a limited number of studies for any one particular health outcome, there is evidence for positive associations between PFAS and dyslipidemia, immunity (including vaccine response and asthma), renal function, and age at menarche.

We searched the electronic database PubMed for preclinical as well as clinical controlled studies pertaining to metabolomics analyses of maternal parameters and their influence on fetal growth. It was observed clearly that metabolic profiling/metabolomics approaches in maternal urine samples provide information on early-life exposure and are potentially linked to child health outcomes, in addition to identifying new biomarkers of exposure.

In this review we critically evaluate the current state of the science regarding human early life exposure processes (until 18 years of age) to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Efficient placental transfer of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) results in relatively high prenatal exposure compared with many neutral organic contaminants. The few biomonitoring studies that specifically target infants, toddlers and other children suggest relatively high serum concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in early life with peak concentrations occurring sometime before the child reaches 20 months. This peak in serum concentrations is most likely explained by exposure via breastfeeding, ingestion of house dust and/or specific contact events with consumer products leading to high body weight normalized estimated daily intakes (EDIs). Although children have higher EDIs of PFASs than adults, these are not always reflected by higher serum levels of PFASs in children in cross-sectional biomonitoring studies due to the confounding effect of age and birth cohort, and different exposure histories due to production changes. Longitudinal exposure studies measuring internal and external exposure (for multiple pathways and PFASs) at several time points during early life are strongly encouraged to understand temporal changes in exposure of individual children. A better quantitative understanding of early life exposure processes would help to improve the validity of epidemiological studies and allow informed decisions regarding setting of regulatory thresholds and appropriate mitigation actions. © 2017 The Authors",

While cholesterol-sensing motifs in transmembrane proteins have been identified, little is known about cholesterol recognition by soluble proteins. We reviewed the structural characteristics of binding sites for cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate from crystallographic structures available in the Protein Data Bank. This analysis unveiled key features of cholesterol-binding sites that are present in either all or the majority of sites: i) the cholesterol molecule is generally positioned between protein domains that have an organized secondary structure; ii) the cholesterol hydroxyl/sulfo group is often partnered by Asn, Gln, and/or Tyr, while the hydrophobic part of cholesterol interacts with Leu, Ile, Val, and/or Phe; iii) cholesterol hydrogen-bonding partners are often found on -helices, while amino acids that interact with cholesterol’s hydrophobic core have a slight preference for -strands and secondary structure-lacking protein areas; iv) the steroid’s C21 and C26 constitute the “hot spots” most often seen for steroid-protein hydrophobic interactions; v) common “cold spots” are C8–C10, C13, and C17, at which contacts with the proteins were not detected. Several common features we identified for soluble protein-steroid interaction appear evolutionarily conserved.—Bukiya, A. N., and A. M. Dopico.

In particular, we focus on fluorine-free sulfonated aromatic polymers as alternatives to the benchmark perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer (e.g., Nafion) PEMs. Most fluorine-free sulfonated aromatic polymers require improved proton conductivity (at high temperatures and low humidity) and chemical and mechanical stability. To address these issues, a wide range of molecular structures and their sequences were investigated. First, the effect of molecular structure on the membrane properties of sulfonated multiblock copoly(arylene ether)s is discussed. We emphasize that phosphine oxide moieties might improve chemical stability; however, aromatic ether linkages in the hydrophilic block are not suitable because oxidative degradation and excess water swelling followed by mechanical failure is essentially inevitable. We then developed a novel polymer synthetic method, an intrapolymer Heck reaction, to ladderize aromatic ether linkages in the hydrophilic block. The ladderized rigid hydrophilic structure is an effective molecular design for balancing proton conductivity and mechanical stability. We then discuss two types of segmented copolymers based on the rigid hydrophilic structural design via a Ni-mediated coupling reaction; the hydrophilic structures are sulfonated phenylene and sulfonated benzophenone. We found that the traditional multiblock structure as well as any additional polar groups (e.g., ether, sulfone, ketone) in the hydrophilic sections are not necessary for improving the membrane properties that are important for fuel cell applications, such as proton conductivity and chemical and mechanical stability. The results indicate that fluorine-free aromatic PEMs are a potentially applicable class of ionomers for the next generation of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. © 2017 The Society of Polymer Science, Japan (SPSJ) All rights reserved.","Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Chemical bonds; Chemical reactions; Chemical stability; Degradation; Ethers; Failure (mechanical); Fluorine; Fuel cells; Hydrophilicity; Ionomers; Ketones; Mechanical stability; Membranes; Molecular structure; Phosphorus compounds; Proton conductivity; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Rigid structures; Stability; Structural design; Fuel cell application; Membrane properties; Multi-block structures; Oxidative degradation; Perfluorosulfonic acid ionomers; Proton exchange membranes; Segmented copolymer; Sulfonated aromatic polymers; Aromatic polymers"

However, few studies that assess the advances of diffuse pollution modeling and studies of trace diffuse pollutants have been conducted. The adaption and development of imported model systems based on local observations and climatic features have improved study skills and presented unique characteristics. In addition to traditional diffuse pollutants (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus), modeling trace heavy metals and pesticide also provides insights for watershed management. Materials and methods: We reviewed existing literature on diffuse pollution model applications and developments in China, attempting to provide a better understanding of the advances of diffuse pollution and new research directions for pollution modeling. Results and discussion: Diverse methods have been adopted to express diffuse pollution formation, transport and environmental impacts using modeling as an effective tool for developing management guidelines in China. Model applications at different temporal–spatial scales, development of diffuse pollution modeling for emerging pollutants, and impacts of diffuse pollution on water quality in China were analyzed. Pollution loading decreased from east to west, coinciding with farmland distributions, tillage intensity, and economic levels. The temporal patterns of pollution loading have increased in recent decades due to increased fertilizer additions and climate warming which has put more pressure on water quality. This analysis indicated that enhancing existing models, with more field observations, is key for future diffuse pollution studies of trace organic pollutants and heavy metals. Establishing national databases and validating standard model parameters are essential and currently weak points at the national scale with respect to diffuse pollution modeling. Conclusions: Diffuse pollution has become a challenging issue in watershed management, and agricultural diffuse pollution poses the greatest risk to watershed management in China. However, the mechanisms involved in trace pollutant transport and the environmental consequences of these pollutants are largely unknown in China, where complicated tillage methods are used and climatic conditions vary throughout the country. Accumulated field observations at diverse temporal–spatial scales are important to accurately model and perform water risk assessments. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","agricultural land; basin management; database; guideline; numerical model; pollutant transport; pollution monitoring; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; tillage; water quality; watershed; China"

Due to the rate of toxicant accumulation, unmanaged disposal, and unknown adverse effects to the environment and the human population, there is a crucial need to screen for environmental toxicants. Animal models and in vitro models are ineffective models in predicting in vivo responses due to inter-species difference and/or lack of physiologically-relevant 3D tissue environment. Such conventional screening assays possess limitations that prevent dynamic understanding of toxicants and their metabolites produced in the human body. Organ-on-a-chip systems can recapitulate in vivo like environment and subsequently in vivo like responses generating a realistic mock-up of human organs of interest, which can potentially provide human physiology-relevant models for studying environmental toxicology. Feasibility, tunability, and low-maintenance features of organ-on-chips can also make possible to construct an interconnected network of multiple-organs-on-chip toward a realistic human-on-a-chip system. Such interconnected organ-on-a-chip network can be efficiently utilized for toxicological studies by enabling the study of metabolism, collective response, and fate of toxicants through its journey in the human body.

However, the rate of association between STICs and HGSOCs and, therefore, the fraction of HGSOCs that are likely to have originated from the fallopian tube (FT), has remained unclear. Objective: To appraise the literature describing the association between STICs and established HGSOCs. Search strategy: Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Selection criteria: Studies were included if they evaluated the frequency of STICs in HGSOCs, and were published in an English peer-reviewed journal. Data collection and analysis: Appropriate studies were evaluated for their compliance with the ‘Strengthening and Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)’ criteria. Main results: Ten articles met the study selection criteria. The reported coexistence between STICs and HGSOCs ranged from 11% to 61% (mean: 31%, 95% CI: 17–46%). STICs were rarely found in other gynaecological cancers. Small sample size, lack of objective criteria to identify STICs and the retrospective nature of the studies contributed to the variability in reporting the rate of the association. Conclusions: STICs were identified commonly in the FTs of women with HGSOC. Finding the true rate of association between STICs and HGSOCs will require further investigations. While there is evidence that a fraction of HGSOCs arise from the FTs, an accurate estimate of that fraction remains to be determined. The lack of an accurate estimate of the association makes it difficult to evaluate the potential magnitude of reduction of HGSOCs following prophylactic salpingectomy.

Aspects of the bioaccumulation potential of IOCs in fish that can be characterized relatively well include the pH dependence of gill uptake and elimination, uptake in the gut, and sorption to phospholipids (membrane–water partitioning). Key challenges include the lack of empirical data for biotransformation and binding in plasma. Fish possess a diverse array of proteins that may transport IOCs across cell membranes. Except in a few cases, however, the significance of this transport for uptake and accumulation of environmental contaminants is unknown. Two case studies are presented. The first describes modeled effects of pH and biotransformation on the bioconcentration of organic acids and bases, while the second employs an updated model to investigate factors responsible for accumulation of perfluorinated alkyl acids. The perfluorinated alkyl acid case study is notable insofar as it illustrates the likely importance of membrane transporters in the kidney and highlights the potential value of read-across approaches. Recognizing the current need to perform bioaccumulation hazard assessments and ecological and exposure risk assessment for IOCs, the authors provide a tiered strategy that progresses (as needed) from conservative assumptions (models and associated data) to more sophisticated models requiring chemical-specific information.

This is compounded by variable regulatory oversight with respect to storage, use and waste management of these chemicals and their byproducts. This review synthesizes the data on the distribution of selected persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in waters in China. Surface water heavily polluted with POPs is distributed in the Yangtze River Estuary, Pearl River Delta, Minjiang River Estuary, Jiulongjiang Estuary, Daya Bay, Taihu Lake, and the waterways of Zhejiang Province, where concentrations of Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) frequently exceed both international and Chinese guideline values. These areas are mainly distributed along the southeast coast of China, within or downstream of major manufacturing districts, intensive agricultural basins, and other industrial centers. A comparison of the levels of OCPs in the aquatic environment of China with other indicative regions worldwide shows comparable levels of pollution (overall range from below detection limit (BDL) to 5104.8 ng/L and regional means from 2.9–929.6 ng/L). PAHs and PCBs pollution appear to be particularly serious in China (PAHs overall ranging from BDL to 474,000 ng/L with regional means from 15.1–72,400 ng/L; PCBs from BDL to 3161 ng/L with regional means ranging from 0.2–985.2 ng/L). There is as yet limited evidence of serious perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) pollution. We discuss major sources and processes responsible for high POP occurrence using a range of measures (including diagnostic ratios of different compounds), regulatory oversight and policy gaps in the control of POPs in China, and potential long-term health and ecological effects. We argue that water quality guidelines, pollution control measures and cleanup strategies for POPs in China should be urgently improved. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Aromatic compounds; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Byproducts; Compounding (chemical); Digital storage; Estuaries; Hydrocarbons; Lake pollution; Organic chemicals; Pesticides; Pollution; Pollution control; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Quality control; River pollution; Rivers; Surface waters; Waste management; Water analysis; Water pollution; Water pollution control; Water quality; Waterworks; China; Organochlorine pesticides; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Organic pollutants; organochlorine pesticide; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative; concentration (composition); organochlorine pesticide; PAH; PCB; persistent organic pollutant; surface water; water pollution; water quality; China; ecosystem monitoring; estuary; limit of detection; persistent organic pollutant; pollution control; Review; risk factor; river basin; sea pollution; sea surface waters; waste water management; water quality; China; Daya Bay; Fujian; Guangdong; Jiulong Estuary; Minjiang Estuary; Taihu Lake; Yangtze Estuary; Zhujiang Delta"

They were identified as endocrine disruptors due to their ability to interfere with thyroid function. The resistance of PFOA and PFOS to environmental degradation, their bio-accumulation in food chains, and their long half-life raised concern in the scientific community, and several studies were performed with the aim to establish the real dangerousness of these compounds for the human health. Purpose: The present review will focus on the effects of PFOA and PFOS on the thyroid gland taking into account in vitro experiments, animal studies, and human data. PFOS and PFOA reduce the circulating levels of thyroid hormones in diet-exposed animals, mainly by increasing their metabolic clearance rate. Conclusions: An accumulation of PFOS and PFOA was documented in thyroid cells, and a cytotoxic effect was observed after exposure to extremely high concentrations of these compounds. In environmentally exposed communities and in the general population, the most consistent effect of exposure to PFOA, and to a less extent to PFOS, is the occurrence of hypothyroidism. Women and children appear to be more at risk of developing mild thyroid failure. Pregnant women with circulating thyroid antibodies might be at risk of developing subclinical hypothyroidism, mainly when exposed at high doses of PFOS. The relative risks for thyroid cancer in people exposed to PFOA and PFOS were low and based on a few cases. Moreover, there was no consistent finding across all or even most studies. © 2016, Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).","endocrine disruptor; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; thyroid hormone; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; chemistry; environmental exposure; human; in vitro study; metabolic clearance rate; nonhuman; occupational exposure; pollution; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; Review; synthesis; thyroid cancer; thyroid function; thyroid gland; female; metabolism; Thyroid Diseases; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Pregnancy; Thyroid Diseases"

Although the majority of studies on C8-dG adducts have focused on lesions containing a C8-N-C tether between the bulky moiety and the nucleobase, the formation of O-linked lesions with a similar tether topology and C-linked adducts involving direct C8-C connectivity have also been uncovered. Several studies have been done to try to better understand the structural impact and mutagenicity of O-linked and C-linked aryl C8-dG adducts, including lesions arising from unsub-stituted and chloro-substituted phenols and the food mutagen ochratoxin A (OTA). Information about the structural preferences of the adducts in duplexes containing the NarI sequence has been gained from optical spectroscopy (UV-vis, CD, and fluorescence), 19F NMR spectroscopy, and computational chemistry (density functional theory calculations at the nucleobase, nucleoside, and nucleotide levels and molecular dynamics simulations of adducted duplexes). The replication of select adducts has also been investigated using primer-elongation assays, and model high-fidelity and Y-family polymerases. Although the (unsubstituted) O-linked phenoxy-dG adduct preferentially induces a single duplex conformation and is replicated as per natural dG, chloro substitution blocks DNA replication. In contrast, the unsubstituted C-linked phenyl-dG adduct induces mismatches, while the C-linked ortho- and para-phenoxy-dG lesions lead to conformational heterogeneity of adducted DNA indicative of strong mutagenic potential. Finally, the C-linked OTA-derived lesion exhibits the greatest conformational flexibility in duplexes, which provides structural explanations for observed outcomes in OTA-exposed cells. Overall, the variation in the conformational preferences of DNA containing O-linked and C-linked aryl-dG adducts highlights the fact that the type of C8 linkage, the presence and location of functional groups in the bulky moiety, the adduct ionization state, and the sequence context can have profound effects on the conformational outcomes of adducted DNA, which directly dictate the activity of the original toxin. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","2,4,6 trichlorophenol; chlorophenol; deoxyguanosine; DNA; double stranded DNA; guanine; nucleic acid base; nucleoside; nucleotide; ochratoxin; pentachlorophenol; phenol derivative; DNA adduct; guanine; mutagenic agent; carcinogenicity; conformational transition; density functional theory; DNA adduct; DNA conformation; DNA damage; DNA replication; DNA structure; DNA synthesis; human; hydrogen bond; ionization; molecular dynamics; mutagenicity; nucleotide sequence; Review; animal; chemistry; mutagenesis; Animals; Deoxyguanosine; DNA Adducts; Guanine; Humans; Mutagenesis; Mutagens; Ochratoxins"

In the last decades, structurally divergent organosilicon reagents are available and have become more employed for synthetic transformation with the aid of transition-metal complexes, because organosilicon compounds are in general superior to other organometallic compounds in view of stability, solubility, nontoxicity, and easy-handling. Particularly, cross-coupling of organosilicon reagents with organic halides or pseudohalides has been considered to be a useful tool for constructing the carbon frameworks of various target molecules such as pharmaceuticals and π-conjugated functional materials. Perfluoroalkylsilicon compounds such as CF3SiEt3 have found use as reagents for the metal-catalyzed introduction of perfluoroalkyl groups into many substrates. In addition, functionalized organosilicon reagents are readily accessible by catalytic approach starting with appropriate hydrocarbons such as alkenes, alkynes, alkanes, and arenes.

Identification of stressors and improved understanding of how scavenging reactions proceed are essential for accelerated development of new fuel cell membrane materials with antioxidant properties and enhanced durability. Fuel cells convert the chemical energy of a fuel such as hydrogen into electricity and heat and have the potential to deliver environmental and economic benefits across various sectors, including transportation, power generation, industrial equipment, military power, and consumer electronics. The development of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) membranes with increased durability is of crucial importance since it directly impacts fuel cell system lifetime and, therefore, large scale implementation of fuel cell technology. The PFSA proton conducting polymer (ionomer) at the heart of the membrane electrode assembly of a PEMFC is subject to chemical degradation as a result of the attack on the polymer chains by reactive oxygen species generated electrochemically in the fuel cell. For the first time, this article reviews the literature both on mechanisms by which this chemical degradation of the ionomer membrane occurs and the sites on the polymer susceptible to free radical attack, as well as how this learning and increased understanding have been used to build and develop successful mitigation strategies designed to annihilate the harmful effect of oxidative species on membrane integrity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Chemical attack; Chemical equipment; Conducting polymers; Degradation; Durability; Free radicals; Ionomers; Membranes; Antioxidant properties; Fuel cell technologies; Membrane electrode assemblies; Perfluorosulfonic acid; Perfluorosulfonic acid membranes; Proton-conducting polymers; Reactive oxygen species; Scavenging reactions; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); antioxidant; chemical method; degradation; fuel cell; identification method; literature review; longevity; membrane; polymer; reactive oxygen species"

As the number of diabetic patients increases, the demand for production of antidiabetic drugs also increases. This, in turn, raises environmental concerns since these drugs eventually reach water bodies through various means like, excretory wastes by the patients. It is urgent to make the appropriate legislation to control and regulate the flow of hypoglycemic pharmaceuticals such as metformin into natural lakes and drinking water reservoirs before undesirable and irreversible changes occur in these waterbodies. The use of metformin leads to the environmental release of this drug into the waterbodies. Mexico is one of the nations with the highest number of obese patients and the quantity of metformin administered per patient can be up 2500 mg/day. There are also other products such as alphaglucosidase inhibitors thiazolidinediones, and meglitinides that have the potential to reach aquatic ecosystems. Information related to their concentrations in natural waters, their metabolites or effects on nontarget organisms is scarce. Most studies on the effects of metformin on aquatic organisms have been on fish, algae, and bacteria while zooplankton have received much less attention. This is surprising since zooplankton species are the principal link between phytoplankton and fish larvae and are more sensitive to stress than algae. Flocculation, activated carbon filtration, ozonisation, and chlorination are ineffective in removing metformin and guanylurea. Therefore, other means of waste disposal of unused antidiabetic drugs must be pursued than treating wastewaters containing them. Metformin and guanylurea are highly water soluble and the available information on the adverse effects of antidiabetic drugs is scarce and restricted to a few groups of aquatic organisms. It is therefore urgently needed to generate appropriate legislation to control and regulate the flow of orally administered pharmaceuticals such as metformin into natural lakes and drinking water reservoirs before undesirable and rreversible changes occur in these waterbodies. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).","activated carbon; aquatic organism; chemical pollutant; chlorination; diabetes; drinking water; drug; freshwater ecosystem; hormone; lake water; phytoplankton; pollutant removal; reservoir; waste disposal; wastewater treatment; zooplankton; Mexico [North America]; algae"

By engineering the substrate specificity and activity of the pathway enzymes that generate the fatty acyl intermediates and chain-tailoring enzymes, researchers can boost the type and yield of medium-chain chemicals.

Furthermore, the reactivity of persulfates is extremely dependent on the related activation techniques and the composition of the treated water matrix. Direct reactions of peroxydisulfate (PDS) or peroxymonosulfate (PMS) are rather slow and mostly unsuitable for pollutant degradation. However, PDS or PMS decompose at elevated temperatures under UV radiation, and radiolysis treatment as well as in presence of reduced metal ions to form sulfate radicals (SO4[rad]−). (SO4[rad]−)-based oxidation can also form secondary oxidants for instance carbonate radicals, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals or singlet oxygen which can influence both transformation efficiency and product formation. The formation of such species is extremely subjected on the water matrix composition and can hardly be predicted. One important aspect in dealing with PDS or PMS is their analysis, which is often prone for interference by other matrix components and hampered by the low stability of PDS and PMS in aqueous systems. Numerous methods for analysis of PDS and PMS are available.

At present, most of the investigations have been conducted in ultrapure water and at concentrations much higher comparing to those detected in the real wastewaters. Furthermore, there are few studies about the toxicity of treated water. In this paper, the state of knowledge on the photocatalytic degradation of PFOX, including photo-oxidative and photo-reductive degradation, is reviewed comprehensively. Compared with photo-oxidation, photo-reduction appears to be more suitable for the PFOX removal since it is more favorable for the defluorination of PFOX and further complete mineralization. The effects of key parameters on the photocatalytic degradation and defluorination process of PFOX are commendably accessed, such as light wavelength, photocatalyst concentration, initial PFOX concentration, pH, reaction atmosphere, temperature, and coexisting organic or inorganic matters. The mechanisms of PFOX photodegradation process are also elucidated in detail. This paper will help to deeply understand PFOX decomposition process and put forward better perspectives in the future for researchers who work in this field. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Endocrine disrupters; Health risks; Mechanisms; Organic pollutants; Photodegradation; Water pollution; Defluorination; Endocrine disrupting properties; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Photo catalytic degradation; Photocatalyst concentration; Photochemical degradation; Water treatment"

Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and thyroid outcomes during the early stages of life. We aimed to review this evidence. Methods We conducted a systematic review in compliance with the PRISMA Statement (search conducted in PubMed and Embase, as well as in the citations of the selected articles). We chose studies if they dealt with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin (T4), or thyroid dysfunctions, and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measured in the blood of pregnant women and/or children up to 19 years old. Results We included in this review three cross-sectional, one case-control, and six cohort studies (publication: 2011–2015), focusing on prenatal life (n = 7), childhood (n = 2) or both periods (n = 1). We observed a high degree of heterogeneity across studies in terms of sampling time (different gestational weeks, at birth, or childhood), outcomes, adjustment for potential confounders, and statistical approach. We found some evidence of a positive association between PFHxS and PFOS exposure and TSH levels measured in maternal blood, and PFNA and TSH levels measured in the blood of boys aged ≥ 11 years. Conclusion Although there is a small number of studies with comparable data, we found some consistency of a positive association between maternal or teenage male exposure to some PFAS and TSH levels based on the current literature. However, further studies are required to confirm these possible relationships. © 2016 The Authors","Hormones; Sampling; Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS); Perfluorononanoic acids; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Prenatal and infant exposure; Thyroid; Blood; liothyronine; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; thyrotropin; thyroxine; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perflexane; blood; child health; cohort analysis; epidemiology; pollution exposure; pregnancy; sulfonate; womens health; birth; case control study; childhood; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; data base; epidemiological data; exposure; human; maternal blood; pregnant woman; prenatal period; Review; systematic review; thyroid disease; thyroid function; thyroid hormone blood level; adolescent; child; drug effects; environmental exposure; female; male; pollutant; pregnancy; thyroid gland; toxicity; Adolescent; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Child; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Male; Pregnancy; Thyroid Gland"

A few PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) are now known to be ubiquitously present in the aquatic environment. They have become a global concern because of the toxicity and bioaccumulative properties. With the increasing availability of high-resolution mass spectrometers, many novel PFASs have been identified. Studies published between 2009 and 2017 have discovered 455 new PFASs (including nine fully and 446 partially fluorinated compounds), 45%, 29%, 17%, and 8% of which are anions, zwitterions, cations, and neutrals, respectively. They have been identified in natural waters, fish, sediments, wastewater, activated sludge, soils, aqueous film-forming foams, and commercial fluoropolymer surfactants. This article integrates and critically evaluates what is known about these newly identified PFASs. It discusses the different aspects of detection methodologies. It also surveys the removal of these compounds during conventional and advanced drinking-water and wastewater treatment, predicts the relevant physicochemical properties by means of four software programs, and identifies major knowledge gaps. Notably, a number of these newly identified PFASs are potential precursor compounds of PFOS and PFOA. Studies are critically needed to understand the removal and transformation of these compounds in natural and engineered environmental systems and their contribution, if any, to the secondary formation of PFOS and PFOA in these systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Physicochemical properties; Potable water; Sediments; Surface active agents; Water treatment; Cationic PFASs; Emerging PFASs; Fluoroalkylether compounds; GenX; Zwitterionic PFASs; Wastewater treatment; ampholyte; anion; carboxylic acid; cation; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; surfactant; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; sewage; surfactant; waste water; water pollutant; aquatic environment; cation; drinking water; literature review; organic compound; physicochemical property; pollutant removal; polymer; software; toxicity; transformation; wastewater; wastewater treatment; activated sludge; aquatic environment; mass spectrometry; physical chemistry; priority journal; Review; sediment; animal; sewage; waste water; water pollutant; Animals; Fluorocarbons; Sewage; Surface-Active Agents; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Notably, human health risk assessment is required for risk mitigation. The lack of human health risk assessment and management may thus unreliably regulate the quality of water resources and efficiency of treatment processes. Therefore, drinking water supply systems (DWSSs) may be still unwarranted in assuring safe access to potable drinking water. Drinking water supply, such as tap water, is an additional and crucial route of human exposure to the health risks associated with EDCs. A holistic system, incorporating continuous research in DWSS monitoring and management using multi-barrier approach, is proposed as a preventive measure to reduce human exposure to the risks associated with EDCs through drinking water consumption. The occurrence of EDCs in DWSSs and corresponding human health risk implications are analyzed using the Needs, Approaches, Benefits, and Challenges (NABC) method. Therefore, this review may act as a supportive tool in protecting human health and environmental quality from EDCs, which is essential for decision-making regarding environmental monitoring and management purposes. Subsequently, the public could have sustainable access to safer and more reliable drinking water. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Decision making; Endocrine disrupters; Environmental management; Health; Health risks; Risk assessment; Water quality; Water resources; Water supply; Water supply systems; Endocrine disrupting compound; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental quality; Human exposures; Human health risk assessment; Monitoring and management; NABC analysis; Preventive measures; Potable water; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; atrazine; chlorphenotane; chlorpyrifos; dimpylate; diuron; drinking water; endocrine disruptor; endosulfan; estradiol; estriol; estrone; ethinylestradiol; lindane; nonylphenol; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; phthalic acid dibutyl ester; phthalic acid diethyl ester; phthalic acid dimethyl ester; polybrominated biphenyl; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; progesterone; quinalphos; simazine; testosterone; triclosan; drinking water; endocrine disruptor; anthropogenic effect; drinking water; endocrine disruptor; health risk; mitigation; public health; risk assessment; water quality; water supply; cell proliferation; central nervous system; environmental exposure; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental monitoring; fluid intake; genital system; growth, development and aging; health hazard; human; metabolic syndrome X; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; water contamination; water supply; environmental exposure; risk assessment; toxicity; water pollutant; Animalia; Drinking Water; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

One of the reasons probably is the assumption that the aerobic degradation is more energetically favorable than degradation under strictly anaerobic conditions. Certain aerobically recalcitrant contaminants, however, are biodegraded under strictly anaerobic conditions and little is known about the organisms and enzymatic processes involved in their degradation. This review provides a comprehensive survey of characteristic anaerobic biotransformation reactions for a variety of well-studied, structurally rather simple contaminants (SMOCs) bearing one or a few different functional groups/structural moieties. Furthermore it summarizes anaerobic degradation studies of more complex contaminants with several functional groups (CMCs), in soil, sediment and wastewater treatment. While strictly anaerobic conditions are able to promote the transformation of several aerobically persistent contaminants, the variety of observed reactions is limited, with reductive dehalogenations and the cleavage of ether bonds being the most prevalent. Thus, it becomes clear that the transferability of degradation mechanisms deduced from culture studies of SMOCs to predict the degradation of CMCs, such as EOCs, in environmental matrices is hampered due the more complex chemical structure bearing different functional groups, different environmental conditions (e.g. matrix, redox, pH), the microbial community (e.g. adaptation, competition) and the low concentrations typical for EOCs. © 2017 The Authors","Biocides; Biodegradation; Degradation; Dehalogenation; Drug products; Pesticides; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic biodegradation; Complex multifunctional contaminants (CMCs); Emerging organic contaminants; Simple mono- or oligofunctional contaminants (SMOCs); Transformation; Contamination; aldehyde; alkane; alkanol; amine; aromatic compound; azo compound; benzene; carbamazepine; carboxylic acid; diatrizoate; diclofenac; ester; ether; ether derivative; ethylbenzene; glyceryl trinitrate; hydrocarbon; imazosulfuron; metolachlor; o demethylase; perfluoro compound; phenol derivative; polycyclic aromatic compound; polyhalogenated hydrocarbon; sulfamethoxazole; sulfonic acid derivative; toluene; triclosan; trimethoprim; unclassified drug; venlafaxine; waste water; anoxic conditions; aquatic environment; biodegradation; biotransformation; concentration (composition); drug; environmental conditions; microbial community; organic pollutant; pesticide; pollutant removal; water treatment; adaptation; anaerobic metabolism; aquatic environment; biodegradation; biotransformation; chemical bond; dehalogenation; microbial community; organic pollution; oxidation reduction reaction; pH; priority journal; Review; sediment; soil; waste water management; water pollutant; bioremediation; waste water; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biotransformation; Waste Water"

This review summarized the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of PFOA-induced toxicity in animals and humans as well as their implications for health risks in humans. Traditional PFOA-induced signal pathways such as peroxisome proliferating receptor alpha (PPARα), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and pregnane-X receptor (PXR) may not be important for PFOA-induced health effects on humans. Instead, pathways including p53/mitochondrial pathway, nuclear lipid hyperaccumulation, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-serine/threonine protein kinase (PI3K-AKT), and tumor necrosis factor-α/nuclear factor κB (TNF-α/NF-κB) may play an important role for PFOA-induced health risks in humans. Both in vivo and in vitro studies are needed to better understand the PFOA-induced toxicity mechanisms as well as the associated health risk in humans. © 2016","Animals; Cell death; Glycoproteins; Health; Macrophages; Organic pollutants; Toxicity; Tumors; Constitutive androstane receptors; Hyperaccumulation; Mitochondrial pathways; Pregnane x receptors; Tumor necrosis factors; Health risks; constitutive androstane receptor; farnesoid X receptor; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; pregnane X receptor; protein kinase B; protein p53; tumor necrosis factor; cell receptor; constitutive androstane receptor; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; pregnane X receptor; steroid receptor; health risk; hyperaccumulation; lipid; mitochondrion; persistent organic pollutant; protein; toxicity; tumor; enzyme activation; genotoxicity; human; immunotoxicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid storage; liver toxicity; mitochondrion; nephrotoxicity; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; protein function; Review; risk assessment; signal transduction; toxicokinetics; animal; metabolism; Animalia; Animals; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; PPAR alpha; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Receptors, Steroid; Signal Transduction"

However, only small number of studies can be found in the literature due to the major drawbacks associated with the GC determination of PFCAs such as high detection limits, a small range of analytes, long analysis time, and laborious derivatization prior to chromatographic separation. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS2) can overcome these limitations of GC, and therefore has become the method of choice for the determination of PFCAs since 2001. Nevertheless, GC as a low-cost and commonly available analytical technique should not be ignored because of its inherent advantage over LC to identify PFCA isomers in environmental and biological matrices owing to its high-resolution power. In addition, GC provides an opportunity to crosscheck LC–MS2 results that are often suspicious due to background contamination. This tutorial provides an overview of GC methods that have been used for the determination of PFCAs after derivatization. Moreover, performance characteristics of GC–MS are compared with that of LC–MS2. PFCAs in aqueous samples were determined by both analytical techniques, and two sets of measurements were compared using the Bland-Altman plot. For both methods, reasons for false-positive and false-negative results (overestimation and underestimation of the PFCA concentration, respectively) are discussed, and accordingly some advice is offered on how to avoid erroneous results. Finally, major applications of GC and its future perspectives for the determination of PFCAs are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Effluents; Isomers; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Phase separation; Bland-altman plots; Chromatographic separations; False positive and false negatives; Gas-chromatographic determination; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Perfluorocarboxylic acid; PFOA; Solid-phase extraction; Gas chromatography; acetic acid ethyl ester; carboxylic acid derivative; dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; formic acid derivative; hydrofluoric acid; isobutylchloroformic acid; n,n bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide; perfluorocarboxylic acid derivative; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorophosphinic acid derivative; propyl chloroformic acid; trifluoroacetamide derivative; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; water; aqueous solution; concentration (parameters); derivatization; false negative result; false positive result; high performance liquid chromatography; human; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography; mass fragmentography; measurement repeatability; microwave emission detector; microwave radiation; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; solid phase extraction; solid phase microextraction; tandem mass spectrometry; analysis; gas chromatography; water pollutant; Chromatography, Gas; Chromatography, Liquid; Fluorocarbons; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"
