Two types of processes integrate these membrane types: separation processes, where electrospun polymers act as a support for thin film composites (TFC), and adsorption as single or coupled processes (photo-catalysis, advanced oxidation, electrochemical), where a functionalization step is essential for the electrospun polymer to improve its properties. Emerging pollutants (EPs) released in the environment can be efficiently removed from water systems using electrospun membranes. The relevant results regarding removal efficiency, adsorption capacity, and the size and porosity of the membranes and fibers used for different EPs are described in detail.",,10.3390/membranes12010067,,NA,

Most of these products contain traces of widespread chemicals, usually known as emerging pollutants (EPs) or pollutants of emerging concern (PEC). The Latin American (LA) region comprises 20 countries with different social and cultural aspects, with 81 % of the population living in urban areas. The LA region has some countries on the top list of users/consumers of EPs, from pesticides and fertilizers to personal care products. However, there is a gap in information related to the distribution of EPs in the environment of this region, with very few existing review texts exploring this issue. Therefore, this present paper advances this approach. An exhaustive literature review, with the selection of 176 documents, provided unique up-to-date information on the presence/distribution of 17 classes of legacy or emerging pollutants in different food and environmental matrices (soil, sediment, water, and air). The study shows that the wide distribution and recorded levels of these pollutants in the continental environment are potential risks to human health, mainly through food and drinking water ingestion. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are pollutants of deep public concern since they show carcinogenic properties. Several classes of pollutants, like endocrine disruptors, have caused harmful effects on humans and the environment. Besides that, pharmaceutical products and pesticides are compounds of high consumption worldwide, being environmental contamination a real and ongoing possibility. Finally, gaps and future research needs are deeply pointed out.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157774,Latin America;Food,NA,

In the future, tailored treatment methods are therefore of increasing significance for accurate removal of target pollutants in different water matrices. This critical review focuses on the overall strategies for accurately removing highly toxic emerging pollutants in the presence of typical interferents. The main difficulties hindering the improvement of selectivity in complex matrices are analyzed, implying that it is difficult to adopt a universal approach for multiple targets and water substrates. Selective methods based on assorted principles are proposed aiming to improve the anti-interference ability. Thus, typical approaches and fundamentals to achieve selectivity are subsequently summarized including their mechanism, superiority and inferior position, application scope, improvement method and the bottlenecks. The results show that different methods may be applicable to certain conditions and target pollutants. To better understand the mechanism of each selective method and further select the appropriate method, advanced methods for qualitative and quantitative characterization of selectivity are presented. The processes of adsorption, interaction, electron transfer, and bond breaking are discussed. Some comparable selective quantitative methods are helpful for promoting the development of related fields. The research framework of selectivity removal and its fundamentals are established. Presently, although continuous advances and remarkable achievements have been attained in the selective removal of characteristic organic pollutants, there are still various substantial challenges and opportunities. It is hopeful to inspire the researches on the new generation of water and wastewater treatment technology, which can selectively and preferentially treat characteristic pollutants, and establish a reliable research framework to lead the direction of environmental science.",,10.1021/acs.est.1c07824,,NA,

We examined individual and mixture associations of PFAS on liver function biomarkers in a representative sample of Canadian adults. We explored the potential for effect modification by sex and body mass index, as well as by physical activity level which may attenuate the deleterious effect of PFAS on metabolic disorders. Methods We analyzed data from participants aged 20-74 from the Canadian Health Measures Survey. We used linear regression to examine associations between plasma concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUDA on serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin. We used quantile g-computation to estimate associations with a PFAS mixture for each simultaneous, one-quartile change in PFAS concentrations. Results Each doubling of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, or PFNA concentrations was associated with higher AST, GGT, and ALP concentrations. Each doubling of PFOA concentrations was associated with 16.5% (95%CI: 10.4, 23.0) higher GGT concentrations among adults not meeting Canada's physical activity guidelines vs. 6.6% (95%CI: -1.6, 15.5) among those meeting these guidelines. Sex and BMI also modified some associations, though to a lesser extent. We did not observe associations between ALT and PFOA (1.2% change; 95%CI: -2.5, 4.9), PFOS (2.2% change; 95%CI: -0.8, 5.3), or PFHxS (1.5% change; 95%CI: -0.4, 3.4). We also did not observe consistent associations for PFDA and PFUDA or with total bilirubin. In quantile g-computation models, each simultaneous one-quartile increase in the PFAS mixture was positively associated with AST (7.5% higher; 95%CI: 4.0, 10.4), GGT (9.7% higher; 95%CI: 1.7, 17.0), and ALP (2.8% higher; 95%CI: 0.5, 5.4). Conclusion Higher plasma concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and PFNA - both individually and as a mixture - were associated with higher serum concentrations of liver function biomarkers. These results contribute to emerging evidence suggesting that higher levels of physical activity appear to be protective against the hepatotoxic effects of PFOA.

Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on PFAS exposure and birth outcomes. Methods: Three electronic databases were searched for epidemiological studies through February 13, 2021. We used random-effects meta-analysis for eight birth outcome indicators to calculate summtary effect estimates for various exposure types. The risk of bias and the overall quality and level of evidence for each exposure-outcome pair were assessed. Results: The initial search identified 58 potentially eligible studies, of which 46 were ultimately included. Many PFAS were found to have previously unrecognized statistically significant associations with birth outcomes. Specifically, birth weight (BW) was associated with PFAS, with effect sizes ranging from -181.209 g (95% confidence interval (CI) = -360.620 to -1.798) per 1 ng/ml increase in perfluoroheptanesulfonate (PFHpS) to -24.252 g (95% CI = -38.574 to -9.930) per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase in perfluorodecaoic acid (PFDA). Similar patterns were observed between other PFAS and birth outcomes: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) with birth length (BL) and ponderal index (PI), PFOS and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA) with head circumference (HC), PFHpS with gestational age (GA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and PFHpS with preterm birth (PTB). Additionally, PFDA showed a statistically significant association with small for gestational age (SGA). The level of the combined evidence for each exposure-outcome pair was considered to be ""moderate "". Conclusion: This study showed that PFAS exposure was significantly associated with increased risks of various adverse birth outcomes and that different birth outcome indicators had different degrees of sensitivity to PFAS. Further studies are needed to confirm our results by expanding the sample size, clarifying the effects of different types or doses of PFAS and the time of blood collection on birth outcomes, and fully considering the possible confounders.",,10.3389/fpubh.2022.855348,,NA,

A suitable model for aquatic toxicity assessment is Hydra, because of morphological, behavioral, reproductive (sexual and asexual), and biochemical changes. Many researchers have used Hydra for toxicity assessment of organic chemicals (BPA), heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, nanomaterials and microplastics. Various Hydra species were used for environmental toxicity studies; however H. magnipapillata was predominantly used due to the availability of its genome and proteome sequences. Teratogenic and reproductive changes in Hydra are species specific. Teratogenic effects were studied using sterozoom dissecting microscope, acridine orange (AO) and 4 ',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DPAI) staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by EPs had been understood by the Dichlorodihydrofluorescein Diacetate (DCFDA) staining and comet assay. Multiple advanced techniques would aid to understand the effects at molecular level, such as real-time PCR, rapid amplification of cDNA end- PCR. EPs modulated the major antioxidant enzyme levels, therefore, defense mechanism was affected by the higher generation of reactive oxygen species.

These pollutants are known for the potential risk that they pose in the environment, and have been consistently found in surface, waste, and potable waters. Moreover, some of them are persistent to conventional treatments and in the environment. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are widely used tech-nology for the removal of EPs The use of peracetic acid (PAA) as an oxidant AOP for the treatment of EPs has attracted increasing interest, owing to its ease of activation, and to the selectivity of the organic radicals that are generated in these processes towards electron rich sites, which makes them more robust against the effect of scavenging agents in real matrices. This work presents a critical analysis of the advantages, disadvantages, and opportunities of PAA-based processes. Several strategies for PAA activation were analyzed, including UV and transition metal activation, heterogeneous catalysis, thermal and microwave activation, and phosphate induced activation. It was found that PAA-based AOPs seem to have several advantages over other widely studied pro-cesses. Some key perspectives for research include testing of these processes with a variety of EPs, analysis of transformation products and their toxicity in the treated effluents, multivariate optimization of the process, direct comparison with widely studied oxidants, and experimentation for escalation and implementation.

The electro-generated hydrogen peroxide leads to the improvement in ozone transformation to hydroxyl radical; hence, the electro-peroxone can considerably improve the treatment performance, total organic carbon (TOC) mineralization, and reduction of ozone-resistant emerging pollutants compared with the traditional ozonation process. Moreover, the main disadvantage of the traditional ozonation process for water treatment is bromate generation during the treatment of bromide-containing water sources, which can be remarkably decreased by the application of this technology. Additionally, because of its enhanced kinetics of contaminant degradation, electro-peroxone offers a more secure, time-efficient, energy-saving, and effective alternative for the reduction of emerging pollutants, compared with different ozone-dependent AOPs including traditional UV/O-3 and peroxone (O-3/H2O2) methods. Hence, it can offer a suitable, eco-friendly, and cost-effective approach to markedly enhance the efficiency of the current ozonation process. This paper reviews the principles of the electro-peroxone process and compares its efficiency with other methods. The essential reaction mechanisms and experimental parameters that are crucial to the operation, realization, and design of the electro-peroxone, including ozone dosage, applied current, injected ozone flowrate, electrolyte type, electrode setup, solution pH, and type of cathode and anode on electro-peroxone efficiency, are investigated.

Here, we established a large dataset for the biomonitoring of seven representative congeners of PFAS by examining data from 2325 publications. Global exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) was the highest, followed by perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Spatiotemporal exposure to PFAS varied considerably, with daily intake estimated in the range of 0.01-1.7 ng/kg/day. Moreover, decreasing trends in PFOS, PFHxS, and PFOA exposure were noted in most regions of the world over the past two decades, but such trends were not observed for other PFAS with long carbon chains, especially in East Asia. Furthermore, we estimated that human exposure to PFOA contributed to approximately 461,635 (95% confidence interval: 57,418 to 854,645) cases per year of LBW during the past two decades, predominantly from Asian regions.

This systematic review aims to assess PFAS associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) concentrations in human populations.Method: We systematically searched four online databases, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library for rele-vant peer-reviewed English language articles published until July 2021. Additional relevant articles identified were also included in the search results. We categorised populations into adults (>= 18 years old) and children. Primary find-ings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and LDL, HDL, TC, and TG concentrations in the serum, plasma, or whole blood; secondary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and the odds of lipid-related health outcomes. Quantitative synthesis was done by vote counting of the effect directions between con-centrations of PFAS and lipids/health outcomes, repeated on articles with sample size >1000. Sign tests were per-formed to assess the statistical significance of the differences between positive and negative associations. Sensitivity analysis was performed by separating out articles with populations having high concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Quality was assessed with the STROBE checklist and NHBLI Study Quality Assessment Tool.Results: A total of 58 articles were included for review. There was evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with higher concentrations of LDL, HDL, and TC, particularly for PFOA-LDL, PFOA-TC, PFOS-TC, and PFNA-LDL. Associa-tions between PFAS and TG tended to be negative, especially for perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). Associations between PFAS concentration and the odds of secondary outcomes generally supported a positive association between PFAS and cholesterol concentrations.Conclusion: We found evidence of associations between the concentrations of some PFAS-lipid pairs in human popula-tions.

However, information regarding its toxicity remains limited. Here, we established a three-dimensional (3D) primary mouse liver spheroid model to compare the hepatotoxicity of HFPO-TA and PFOA. The 3D spheroids were repeatedly exposed to 25-, 50-, or 100-mu M HFPOTA and PFOA for 28 d. Compared with the PFOA groups, the HFPO-TA groups showed higher bioaccumulation potential, higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, and lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP), albumin, and urea secretion. Transcriptome analysis identified 1603 and 772 differentially expressed genes in the 100-mu M HFPO TA-and PFOA-treated groups, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that cholesterol metabolism, bile acid metabolism, and inflammatory response were significantly altered. Exposure to 100-mu M HFPO-TA increased triglyceride content but decreased total cholesterol content, while no changes were observed in the 100-mu M PFOA-treated group. Total bile acids in the re-polarized 3D spheroids increased significantly after 100-mu M HFPO-TA and PFOA treatment, which did not affect bile acid synthesis but inhibited the expression levels of Bsep and Mrp2 related to bile acid transport. Thus, HFPO-TA exhibited more serious hepatotoxicity than PFOA in 3D primary liver spheroids and may not be a safe alternative. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

There is information indicating other sources and pathways of exposure in residential environments, but few studies report relationships between these indoor media and human bio-monitoring measurements.        Methods: This study adapts existing systematic review tools and methodologies to synthesize evidence for PFAS exposure pathways from indoor environment media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust. Studies were identified using innovative machine learning approaches and pathway-specific search strings to reduce time needed for literature search and screening. The included studies and systematic review were evaluated using tools modified specifically for exposure studies. The systematic review was conducted following a previously published protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) that describes the systematic review methodology used in detail.        Results: Only 7 studies were identified that measured the targeted subset of 8 PFAS chemicals in concordant household media (primarily house dust) and participant serum. Data extracted from the included studies were used to calculate exposure intake rates and estimate a percentage of occupant serum concentrations that could be attributed to the indoor exposure pathways. These calculations showed that exposure to PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS from contaminated house dust could account for 13%, 3%, 7%, and 25% of serum concentrations, respectively. Inhalation of PFAS in indoor air could account for less than 4% of serum PFOA concentrations and less than 2% of serum PFOS and PFNA concentrations. A risk of bias was identified due to participant profiles in most of the studies being skewed towards white, female, and higher socioeconomic status.        Conclusions: Along with synthesizing evidence for estimated contributions to serum PFAS levels from indoor exposure media, this systematic review also identifies a consistent risk of bias across exposure study populations that should be considered in future studies.

Distinct characteristics of biochar can be appropriate, costeffective, and eco-friendly for removing a wide spectrum of inorganic and organic pollutants. This review aims to emphasize the crucial function of biochar-based materials in the abatement of toxic emerging pollutants. It covers the synthesis and applications of engineered biochars by discussing extensive research and knowledge in this area. The relationships of biochar properties with feedstock, synthesis conditions, technologies and modification methods have also been discussed. Biochars with different surface functionalities (e.g., COO-, Fe-O, etc.,) can be obtained by either varying the feedstock material (lignocellulosic or non-lignocellulosic) or by modifying it with different chemicals (e.g., metal ions, rare earth elements, surfactants) including the preparation of composites. The interaction mechanisms between biochar and various pollutants are reviewed and analyzed. The type of interactions (e.g., electrostatic, pi-pi stacking, hydrogen bonding) depends on the different surface functionalities of biochar. This review also illustrates that biochar and its related composites have shown remarkable properties and versatility for their effective application in adsorption, photocatalysis and oxidation processes in aqueous phase. Finally, prospective research directions and opportunity areas for biochar research are also discussed.

In the present study, PPs have been considered one of the emerging pollutants (EPs) and a cause of concern in river health assessment. Beyond the reported increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ABRB), PPs have been found adversely affecting the biotic diversity in such water environments. Considering Algae, Mac-roinvertebrates, and Fishes as three distinct trophic level indicators, the present study puts forward a framework for showing River Health Condition (RHC) based on the calculation of a River Health Index (RHI). The RHI is calculated using six Indicator Group Scores (IGS) which individually reflect river health in a defined category of water quality characteristics. While Dissolved Oxygen Related Parameters (DORP), Nutrients (NT), and PPs are taken as causative agents affecting RHCs, scores of Algal-Bacterial (AB) symbiosis, Macroinvertebrates (MI), and Fishes (F) are considered as an effect of such environmental conditions. Current wastewater treatment tech-nologies are also not very effective in the removal of PPs. The objective of the present study is to review the harmful effects of PPs on the aquatic environment, particularly on the chemical and biotic indicators of river health. Based on predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) for algae, macroinvertebrates, and fishes in the aquatic environment and measured environmental concentration (MEC) in the river, the estimated risk quotient (RQ) for norfloxacin in the Isakavagu-Nakkavagu stream of river Godavari, Hyderabad is found 293 for algae, 39 for MI, and 335 for fish. Among PPs, in Indian rivers, the presence of caffeine is the most frequent, with algae at the highest level of risk (RQmax= 24.5).Broadly six PPs, including azithromycin, caffeine, diclofenac, naproxen, norfloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole are found above PNEC values in Indian rivers. The application of IGS and RHI in understanding and presenting the river health condition (RHC) through colored hexagons has been demonstrated for the river Ganga near Varanasi (India) as an example. Identification of critical indicator groups, based on IGS provides a scientific basis for planned intervention for river health restoration to achieve an acceptable category.",,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.114220,,NA,

However, this process is time-consuming, and produces additional solid waste and air pollution. Treatment methods for PFOS and PFOA generally follow two routes: (1) removal from source and reduce the risk; (2) degradation. Emerging technologies focusing on degradation are critically reviewed in this contribution. Various processes such as bioremediation, electrocoagulation, foam fractionation, sonolysis, photocatalysis, mechanochemical, electrochemical degradation, beams of electron and plasma have been developed and studied in the past decade to address PFAS crisis. The underlying mechanisms of these PFAS degradation methods have been categorized.

The final data set comprises approximately 21,000 data points after removal of time-series and duplicate samples as well as non-detects. The reported concentrations range over many orders of magnitude, from ng/L to mg/L levels. Distinct differences in concentration ranges are observed between sites located within or near sources versus those that are not. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), ranging from <0.03 ng/L to-7 mg/L, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), ranging from 0.01 ng/L to-5 mg/L, were the two most reported PFAS. The highest PFAS concentration in groundwater is-15 mg/L reported for the replacement-PFAS 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS). Maximum reported groundwater concentrations for PFOA and PFOS were compared to concentrations reported for soils, surface waters, marine waters, and precipitation. Soil concentrations are generally significantly higher than those reported for the other media. This accrues to soil being the primary entry point for PFAS release into the environment for many sites, as well as the generally significantly greater retention capacity of soil compared to the other media. The presence of PFAS has been reported for all media in all regions tested, including areas that are far removed from specific PFAS sources. This gives rise to the existence of a ""background"" concentration of PFAS that must be accounted for in both regional and site-specific risk assessments. The presence of this background is a reflection of the large-scale use of PFAS, their general recalcitrance, and the action of long-range transport processes that distribute PFAS across regional and global scales.

Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent synthetic chemicals widely used in industry and consumer products and bioaccumulate in food webs and human tissues, such as the liver. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis evaluating PFAS exposure and evidence of liver injury from rodent and epidemiological studies. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched for all studies from earliest available indexing year through 1 December 2021 using keywords corresponding to PFAS exposure and liver injury. For data synthesis, results were limited to studies in humans and rodents assessing the following indicators of liver injury: serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or steatosis. For human studies, at least three observational studies per PFAS were used to conduct a weighted z-score meta-analysis to determine the direction and significance of associations. For rodent studies, data were synthesized to qualitatively summarize the direction and significance of effect. RESULTS: Our search yielded 85 rodent studies and 24 epidemiological studies, primarily of people from the United States. Studies focused primarily on legacy PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid. Meta-analyses of human studies revealed that higher ALT levels were associated with exposure to PFOA (z-score = 6.20, p < 0:001), PFOS (z-score = 3.55, p < 0:001), and PFNA (z-score = 2.27, p = 0:023). PFOA exposure was also associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in humans. In rodents, PFAS exposures consistently resulted in higher ALT levels and steatosis.

We therefore quantified disease burdens and related economic costs due to legacy PFAS exposures in the US in 2018. We leveraged systematic reviews and used meta-analytic inputs whenever possible, identified previously published exposure-response relationships, and calculated PFOA- and PFOS-attributable increases in 13 conditions. These increments were then applied to census data to determine total annual PFOA- and PFOS-attributable cases of disease, from which we calculated economic costs due to medical care and lost productivity using previously published cost-of-illness data. We identified PFAS-attributable disease costs in the US of $5.52 billion across five primary disease endpoints shown to be associated with PFAS exposure in meta-analyses. This estimate represented the lower bound, with sensitivity analyses revealing as much as $62.6 billion in overall costs. While further work is needed to assess probability of causation and establish with greater certainty effects of the broader category of PFAS, the results confirm further that public health and policy interventions are still necessary to reduce exposure to PFOA and PFOS and their endocrine-disrupting effects.

With over 9000 compounds belonging to this chemical class, there is increasing concern regarding human exposure to these compounds due to their persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic nature. Human exposure to PFAS may occur from a variety of exposure sources, including, air, food, indoor dust, soil, water, from the transfer of PFAS from non-stick wrappers to food, use of cosmetics, and other personal care products. This critical review presents recent research on the healthrelated impacts of PFAS exposure, highlighting compounds other than Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and Perfluoroctane sulfonate (PFOS) that cause adverse health effects, updates the current state of knowledge on PFAS toxicity, and, where possible, elucidates cause-and-effect relationships. Recent reviews identified that exposure to PFAS was associated with adverse health impacts on female and male fertility, metabolism in pregnancy, endocrine function including pancreatic dysfunction and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, lipid metabolism and risk of childhood adiposity, hepatic and renal function, immune function, cardiovascular health (atherosclerosis), bone health including risk for dental cavities, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deficiency, neurological function, and risk of developing breast cancer. However, while cause-and-effect relationships for many of these outcomes were not able to be clearly elucidated, it was identified that 1) the evidence derived from both animal models and humans suggested that PFAS may exert harmful impacts on both animals and humans, however extrapolating data from animal to human studies was complicated due to differences in exposure/elimination kinetics, 2) PFAS precursor kinetics and toxicity mechanism data are still limited despite ongoing exposures, and",,10.1016/j.envres.2022.113431,,NA,

These synthetic chemicals are in widespread use for consumer products, firefighting foams, and industrial applications. They have been detected all over the globe, including at remote locations distant from any possible point sources. One mechanism for long-range transport of PFAS is through sorption to aerosol particles in the atmosphere. PFAS can be transferred from the sea surface to sea spray aerosol particles through wave breaking and bubble bursting, and PFAS emitted to the atmosphere in the gas phase can sorb to particulate matter through gas-particle partitioning. Here we present a comprehensive review of global measurements of PFAS on ambient particulate matter dating back to the first reports from the early 2000s. We summarize findings for the historically important C8 species, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), including detection of isomers and size-segregated measurements, as well as studies of newer and emerging PFAS. We conclude that long-term monitoring of PFAS on particulate matter should be expanded to include more measurement sites in under-sampled regions of the world and that further non-targeted work to identify novel PFAS structures is needed as PFAS manufacturing and regulations continue to evolve.",,10.1039/d2em00002d,Aerosols,NA,

PFAS exposure in people can have detrimental health consequences. Therefore, reducing PFAS burdens in food items is of great importance to public health. Here, we investigated whether cooking reduces PFAS concentrations in animal-derived food products by synthesizing experimental studies. Further, we examined the moderating effects of the following five variables: cooking time, liquid/animal tissue ratio, cooking temperature, carbon chain length of PFAS and the cooking category (oil-based, water-based & no-liquid cooking). In our systematic review searches, we obtained 512 effect sizes (relative differences in PFAS concentration between raw and cooked samples) from 10 relevant studies. These studies exclusively explored changes in PFAS concentrations in cooked seafood and freshwater fish. Our multilevel-meta-analysis has revealed that, on average, cooking reduced PFAS concentrations by 29%, although heterogeneity among effect sizes was very high (I2 = 94.65%). Our five moderators cumulatively explained 49% of the observed heterogeneity. Specifically, an increase in cooking time and liquid/animal tissue ratio, as well as shorter carbon chain length of PFAS (when cooked with oil) were associated with significant reductions in PFAS concentrations. The effects of different ways of cooking depended on the other moderators, while the effect of cooking temperature itself was not significant. Overall, cooking can reduce PFAS concentrations in blue food (seafood and freshwater fish). However, it is important to note that complete PFAS elimination requires unrealistically long cooking times and large liquid/animal tissue ratios. Currently, literature on the impact of cooking of terrestrial animal produce on PFAS concentrations is lacking, which limits the inference and generalisation of our meta-analysis. However, our work represents the first step towards developing guidelines to reduce PFAS in food via cooking exclusively with common kitchen items and techniques.",,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119081,,NA,

Such nanocomposite materials benefit from the synergistic effect of adsorption and photocatalysis to attain improved removal of pollutants from water and wastewater. Under this review, three BC-based nanocomposite photocatalysts such as BC-TiO2, BC-ZnO, and BC-spinel ferrites were considered. These nanocomposites acquire intrinsic properties to improve the practical limitations of the pristine BC and photocatalysts. The BC-based nanocomposites attained high photocatalytic activity, mechanical hardness, thermal stability, chemically non-reactive, magnetically permeable, reduced energy band gaps, improved reusability, and simplified recovery. Moreover, BC-based photocatalytic nanocomposites showed reduced recombination rates of the electron-hole pairs which are desirable for photocatalytic applications. However, the surface areas of the composites are usually smaller than that of the BC but higher than those of the pristine photocatalysts. Practically, the performances of the nanocomposites are much superior to those of the corresponding pristine components. This hybrid treatment technology is an emerging field and its industrial application is still at an early stage of the investigation. Therefore, exploring the full potential and practical applications of this technology is highly encouraging.

This systematic review compiles and analyzes the mechanisms and degradation pathways of PFAS by persulfate activation, photocatalysis, UV/sulfite, electron beam, electrochemical oxidation, plasma, ozonation, and sonochemical oxidation. We found that the degradation pathways of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and Perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids (PFSAs) were investigated more than any other PFAS. This review implies that the defluorination and degradation pathways of PFAS are reliant on the type of dominant reactive oxidant or reductive species. For instance, holes usually oxidize PFAS to unstable perfluoroalkyl radicals accompanied by losing head groups, whereas hydroxyl and superoxide radicals cleave C-C and C-F bonds. On the other hand, hydrated electrons directly eliminate the head group followed by releasing CF2 units. Furthermore, the imposed crystal facets and functional groups of the introduced catalytic surfaces in the case of heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., photocatalysts) affected the degradation pathways and defluorination rates by anchoring PFAS molecules from the head groups (e.g., carboxylate and sulfonate group).

The complete mineralisation of aqueous PFAS by ultrasound (sonolysis) into harmless inorganics has been demonstrated in many studies. However, the range and interconnected nature of reaction parameters (frequency, power, temperature etc.), and variety of reaction metrics used, limits understanding of degradation mechanisms and parametric trends. This work summarises the state-of-the-art for PFAS sonolysis, considering reaction mechanisms, kinetics, intermediates, products, rate limiting steps, reactant and product measurement techniques, and effects of co-contaminants. The meta-analysis showed that mid-high frequency (100 - 1,000 kHz) sonolysis mechanisms are similar, regardless of reaction conditions, while the low frequency (20 - 100 kHz) mechanisms are specific to oxidative species added, less well understood, and generally slower than mid-high frequency mechanisms. Arguments suggest that PFAS degradation occurs via adsorption (not absorption) at the bubble interface, followed by headgroup cleavage. Further mechanistic steps toward mineralisation remain to be proven. For the first time, complete stoichiometric reaction equations are derived for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) sonolysis, which add H2 as a reaction product and consider CO an intermediate. Fluorinated intermediate products are derived for common, and more novel PFAS, and a naming system proposed for novel perfluoroether carboxylates. The meta-analysis also revealed the transition between pseudo first and zero order PFOA/S kinetics commonly occurs at 15 - 40 mu M. Optimum values of; ultrasonic frequency (300 - 500 kHz), concentration (> 15 - 40 mu M), temperature (asymptotic to 120 C), and pH range (3.2 - 4) for rapid PFOX degradation are derived by evaluation of prior works, while optimum values for the dilution factor applied to PFAS containing firefighting foams and applied power require further work. Rate limiting steps are debated and F- is shown to be rate enhancing, while SO(4)(2-)and CO2 by products are theorised to be rate limiting. Sonolysis was compared to other PFAS destructive technologies and shown to be the only treatment which fully mineralises PFAS, degrades different PFAS in order of decreasing hydrophobicity, is parametrically well studied, and has low-moderate energy requirements (several kWh g(-1) PFAS).

Animal studies suggest that PFAS may increase risk of fatty liver and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via impacts on hepatic lipid, amino acid, and glucose metabolism, but human data is lacking. We examined associations between PFAS exposure, altered metabolic pathways, and risk of non-viral HCC. Methods: In this nested case-control study, pre-diagnostic plasma PFAS and metabolomics were measured in 50 incident HCC cases and 50 individually matched controls from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study. Cases/controls were matched by age, sex, race, and study area. PFAS exposure and risk of HCC were examined using conditional logistic regression. A metabolome-wide association study and pathway enrichment analysis was performed for PFAS exposure and HCC risk, and key metabolites/metabolic pathways were identified using a meet in the middle approach. Results: High perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) levels (90th percentile from NHANES; > 55 lg/L) were associated with 4.5 -fold increased risk of HCC (odds ratio 4.5, 95% CI 1.2-16.0). Pathway enrichment analysis showed that PFOS exposure was associated with alterations in amino acid and glycan biosynthesis pathways, which were also associated with HCC risk. We identified 4 metabolites linking PFOS exposure with HCC, including glucose, butyric acid (a short-chain fatty acid), alpha-ketoisovaleric acid (a branched-chain a-keto acid), and 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoate (a bile acid), each of which was positively associated with PFOS exposure and risk of HCC. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept analysis shows that exposure to high PFOS levels was associated with increased risk of non-viral HCC, likely via alterations in glucose, amino acid, and bile acid metabolism. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. Lay summary: Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as ""forever chemicals "" because they are difficult to break down and stay in the human body for years, are extremely common and can cause liver damage. In a first of its kind study, we found that exposure to high levels of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, one of the most common PFAS chemicals, was linked to increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in humans. Hepatocellular carcinoma is difficult to treat and is one of the most common forms of liver cancer, and these findings may provide new avenues for helping to prevent this disease.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Moreover, a rough characterisation of hospital effluents is presented. The main detected PhCs are antibiotics and psychiatric drugs, with concentrations up to 1.1 mg/L. On the one hand, regarding the presented technologies, membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are a good alternative for treating HWW with PhCs removal values higher than 80% in removing analgesics, anti-inflammatories, cardiovascular drugs, and some antibiotics. Moreover, this system has been scaled up to the pilot plant scale. However, some target compounds are still present in the treated effluent, such as psychiatric and contrast media drugs and recalcitrant antibiotics (erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole). On the other hand, ozonation effectively removes antibiotics found in the HWW (>93%), and some studies are carried out at the pilot plant scale. Even though, some families, such as the X-ray contrast media, are recalcitrant to ozone. Other advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as Fenton-like or UV treatments, seem very effective for removing pharmaceuticals, Antibiotic Resistance Bacteria (ARBs) and Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs). However, they are not implanted at pilot plant or full scale as they usually consider extra reactants such as ozone, iron, or UV-light, making the scale-up of the processes a challenging task to treat high-loading wastewater. Thus, several examples of biological wastewater treatment methods combined with AOPs have been proposed as the better strategy to treat HWW with high removal of PhCs (generally over 98%) and ARGs/ARBs (below the detection limit) and lower spending on reactants. However, it still requires further development and optimisation of the integrated processes.",,10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115769,,NA,

Objectives This study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS with mortality and morbidity of diabetes and to quantitatively evaluate the summary effect estimates of the existing literature. Methods We searched three electronic databases for epidemiological studies concerning PFAS and diabetes published before April 1, 2022. Summary odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), or beta and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were respectively calculated to evaluate the association between PFAS and diabetes using random-effects model by the exposure type, and dose-response meta-analyses were also performed when possible. We also assessed the risk of bias of the studies included and the confidence in the body of evidence. Results An initial literature search identified 1969 studies, of which 22 studies were eventually included. The meta-analyses indicated that the observed statistically significant PFAS-T2DM associations were consistent in cohort studies, while the associations were almost non-significant in case-control and cross-sectional studies. Dose-response meta-analysis showed a ""parabolic-shaped"" association between perfluorooctanoate acid (PFOA) exposure and T2DM risk. Available evidence was rated with ""low"" risk of bias, and the level of evidence for PFAS and incident T2DM was considered ""moderate"". Conclusions Our findings suggest that PFAS exposure may increase the risk of incident T2DM, and that PFOA may exert non-monotonic dose-response effect on T2DM risk. Considering the widespread exposure, persistence, and potential for adverse health effects of PFAS, further cohort studies with improvements in expanding the sample size, adjusting the covariates, and considering different types of PFAS exposure at various doses, are needed to elucidate the putative causal associations and potential mode of action of different PFAS on diabetes. Impact Statement A growing body of evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are endocrine disruptors and may contribute to the development of diabetes. However, epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS and diabetes is inconsistent. We performed this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the evidence.

In the present contribution, the current knowledge of PFAS contamination was systematically reviewed in order to provide with the knowledge gaps and main sources of contamination, as well as critically evaluate estimated dietary intake and relative risk values of the consulted studies. Legacy PFASs remain the most abundant despite their production restrictions. Edible species from freshwater bodies exhibit higher PFAS concentrations than marine species, probably due to low hydrodynamics and dilution in lentic ecosystems. Studies in food products from multiple sources, including aquatic, livestock, and agricultural, agree that the proximity to factories and fluorochemical industries rendered significantly higher and potentially hazardous PFAS contamination.

Environmental contaminants - aromatic compounds, mycotoxins and phytotoxins like aristolochic acids (AAs) - polluting food and drinking water sources, were incriminated in BEN, due to their nephrotoxic and carcinogenic properties. The implication of AAs in BEN etiology is currently a highly debated topic due to the fact that they are found within the Aristolochiaceae plants family, used around the globe as traditional medicine and they were also incriminated in Aristolochic Acid Nephropathy (AAN). Exposure pathways have been investigated, but it is unclear to what extent AAs are acting alone or in synergy with other cofactors (environmental, genetics) in triggering kidney damage.

Based on an analysis of the available human epidemiology, the overall level of evidence regarding associations between PFAS serum levels and reduced antibody response remains weak. Absence of an association between an increase in clinical infections and PFAS serum levels and the limited understanding of the importance of antibody levels as an isolated data point further support this conclusion. Animal toxicity studies with PFAS focusing on immunomodulation also provide only limited support for immunomodulation as an important endpoint in PFAS toxicity. While immunomodulation is observed after PFAS administration, generally at blood concentrations several orders of magnitude above those seen in environmentally exposed humans, the relevance of these observation is hampered by the high doses required to influence immune endpoints, the limited number of endpoints assessed, and inconsistent results.

Occupational PFAS exposure is of particular concern as research on PFAS exposure in worker populations has historically been limited and generally restricted to fluorochemical plant workers involved in PFAS production. MethodsA comprehensive review of peer-reviewed scientific literature was conducted to investigate which worker populations may experience occupational exposure to PFAS. Serum PFAS levels reported in various occupations were analyzed and compared to serum PFAS levels published on the general public exposed to PFAS-contaminated drinking water and the study population of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). ResultsOur analysis indicates that professional ski waxers and firefighters may be exposed to several different PFAS at levels often similar to or higher than levels among fluorochemical plant workers and individuals in communities with PFAS-contaminated drinking water, and higher than levels in the general public. PFAS serum level data on other occupations were largely absent.

These emerging pollutants cause several hazardous health issues to humans, animals, and the ecosystem. Conventional treatment methodology faces different issues in the recognition and removal of toxins, such as expense, facile operation conditions, and the prerequisite of high maintenance. To overcome this issue, adsorption is viewed as one of the most encouraging innovations for the removal of pollutants. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered to be efficiently adsorbent, because of their porosity, high surface area, fine-tunable metal clusters, and easy functional surface engineering properties. This Review concerns the recent examinations on MOFs as proficient material in the removal of toxic contaminants from wastewater. The adsorption mechanism of toxic pollutants removal using MOFs-based materials was critically reviewed and discussed.

This review consolidates the most recent data on different aspects of PFAS, such as their occurrence, and prominent sources. The current literature analysis of PFAS occurrence suggests significant variation in their concentration ranging from 0.025 to 1.2 x 10(8) ng/L in wastewater, 0.01 to 8.9 x 10(5) ng/L in surface water, and < 0.01 to 1.3 x 10(4) ng/L in groundwater globally. Since conventional treatment techniques are inadequate in remediating PFAS, innovative treatment approaches based on their removal or mineralization mechanism have been comprehensively reviewed. Advanced treatment technologies have shown degradation or removal of PFAS to be around 6 and > 99.9% in different aqueous matrices. However, due to significant drawbacks in their applicability in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), a novel treatment train approach has emerged as an effective alternative. This approach synergistically integrates multiple remediation techniques while addressing the impediments of individual treatments. Furthermore, nanofiltration (NF270) combined with electrochemical degradation has been demonstrated to be the most efficient (> 98%) treatment train approach in PFAS remediation. If implemented in WWTPs, nanofiltration fol-lowed by adsorption using activated carbon is also a viable method for PFAS removal.",,10.1016/j.envres.2022.114004,,NA,

PFAS cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. Thus, PFAS are a likely risk for neurotoxicity. Studies that measured PFAS levels in the brains of humans, polar bears, and rats have demonstrated that some areas of the brain accumulate greater amounts of PFAS. Moreover, in humans, there is evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and an increased cause of death from Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease in elderly populations. Given possible links to neurological disease, critical analyses of possible mechanisms of neurotoxic action are necessary to advance the field. This paper critically reviews studies that investigated potential mechanistic causes for neurotoxicity including (1) a change in neurotransmitter levels, (2) dysfunction of synaptic calcium homeostasis, and (3) alteration of synaptic and neuronal protein expression and function. We found growing evidence that PFAS exposure causes neurotoxicity through the disruption of neurotransmission, particularly the dopamine and glutamate systems, which are implicated in age-related psychiatric illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases. Evaluated research has shown there are highly reproduced increased glutamate levels in the hippocampus and catecholamine levels in the hypothalamus and decreased dopamine in the whole brain after PFAS exposure. There are significant gaps in the literature relative to the assessment of the nigrostriatal system (striatum and ventral midbrain) among other regions associated with PFAS-associated neurologic dysfunction observed in humans. In conclusion, evidence suggests that PFAS may be neurotoxic and associated with chronic and age-related psychiatric illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, it is imperative that future mechanistic studies assess the impact of PFAS and PFAS mixtures on the mechanism of neurotransmission and the consequential functional effects.",,10.1021/acs.chemrestox.2c00072,Synaptic Transmission,NA,

Recent Findings: Eleven human studies published before April 1st, 2021 were identified through database searches (PubMed, Dimensions, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus), and citation chaining (Citationchaser). The sample sizes of these studies ranged from 40 to 965, involving children and adolescents (n = 3), nonpregnant adults (n = 5), or pregnant women (n = 3). High-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was the primary analytical platform to measure both PFAS and metabolome. PFAS were measured in either plasma (n = 6) or serum (n = 5), while metabolomic profiles were assessed using plasma (n = 6), serum (n = 4), or urine (n = 1). Four types of PFAS (perfluorooctane sulfonate (n = 11), perfluorooctanoic acid (n = 10), perfluorohexane sulfonate (n = 9), perfluorononanoic acid (n = 5)) and PFAS mixtures (n = 7) were the most studied. We found that alterations to tryptophan metabolism and the urea cycle were most reported PFAS-associated metabolomic signatures. Numerous lipid metabolites were also suggested to be associated with PFAS exposure, especially key metabolites in glycerophospholipid metabolism which is critical for biological membrane functions, and fatty acids and carnitines which are relevant to the energy supply pathway of fatty acid oxidation. Other important metabolome changes reported included the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle regarding energy generation, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism in cellular energy systems.        Conclusions: There is growing interest in using non-targeted metabolomics to study the human physiological changes associated with PFAS exposure. Multiple PFAS were reported to be associated with alterations in amino acid and lipid metabolism, but these results are driven by one predominant type of pathway analysis thus require further confirmation. Standardizing research methods and reporting are recommended to facilitate result comparison.

PFAS exposure can affect the function of the nervous, endocrine, and immune system of animals and humans.

A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases up to February 2022. We chose studies that measured serum vaccines antibodies and PFAS concentrations of the participants. Essential information, including mean difference of percentage change, regression coefficient, odds ratio, Spearman correlation coefficient, and 95% confidence intervals, were extracted from the selected studies to conduct descriptive analysis and meta-analysis where appropriate. The qualities of these studies were evaluated as well. Finally, nine epidemiological studies about children met our inclusion criteria. A high degree of heterogeneity is observed in terms of breastfeeding time, confounder control, and detection method. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level in children without heterogeneity by Cochran's Q test (p = 0.26; p = 0.55), and exposure to perfluorohexane sulfonate is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level but with heterogeneity (p = 0.04). This comprehensive review suggests that PFAS can have adverse health effects on children by hindering the production of vaccine antibodies. There are some consistent and negative associations between children exposure to certain PFAS and tetanus antibody level. The association of the other four vaccines (measles, rubella, mumps, and influenza) with PFAS remains uncertain, because very few studies are available.

Objective: To create a systematic evidence map of the available peer-reviewed health or toxicological research for 29 PFAS.        Methods: A protocol for conducting this systematic evidence map was initially published on Zenodo (Pelch et al. 2019c), then peer reviewed and published in Environment International (Pelch et al. 2019d) PubMed database was searched through January 25, 2021. Studies were screened for inclusion and exclusion according to the Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) statement. Inclusion criteria were intentionally broad and included any human, animal, and/or in vitro study that investigated exposure to one of the 29 PFAS of interest and a human health or toxicological effect. Selected study details were extracted from included studies as described in the protocol. Study appraisal was not conducted. The included studies and extracted meta-data are freely available in the online, interactive systematic evidence map at https://pfastoxdatabase.org.        Results: Over 15,000 studies were retrieved from the PubMed literature searches. After manual screening, 1,067 studies were identified and included as investigating the health or toxicological effect of one or more PFAS of interest.

Thousands of distinct PFAS exist in commerce. The 2019 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Action Plan outlines a multiprogram national research plan to address the challenge of PFAS. One component of this strategy involves the use of systematic evidence map (SEM) approaches to characterize the evidence base for hundreds of PFAS. OBJECTIVE: SEM methods were used to summarize available epidemiological and animal bioassay evidence for a set of ∼ 150 PFAS that were prioritized in 2019 by the U.S. EPA’s Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) for in vitro toxicity and toxicokinetic assay testing. METHODS: Systematic review methods were used to identify and screen literature using manual review and machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify mammalian animal bioassay and epidemiological studies that could inform human hazard identification. A variety of supplemental content was also tracked, including information on in vitro model systems; exposure measurement–only studies in humans; and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Animal bioassay and epidemiology studies meeting PECO criteria were summarized with respect to study design, and health system(s) were assessed. Because animal bioassay studies with ≥21-d exposure duration (or reproductive/developmental study design) were most useful to CCTE analyses, these studies underwent study evaluation and detailed data extraction. All data extraction is publicly available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata. RESULTS: More than 40,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes identified 44 animal and 148 epidemiology studies from the peer-reviewed literature and 95 animal and 50 epidemiology studies from gray literature that met PECO criteria. Epidemiological evidence (available for 15 PFAS) mostly assessed the reproductive, endocrine, developmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Animal evidence (available for 40 PFAS) commonly assessed effects in the reproductive, developmental, urinary, immunological, and hepatic systems. Overall, 45 PFAS had evidence across animal and epidemiology data streams. DISCUSSION: Many of the ∼ 150 PFAS were data poor. Epidemiological and animal evidence were lacking for most of the PFAS included in our search. By disseminating this information, we hope to facilitate additional assessment work by providing the initial scoping literature survey and identifying key research needs. Future research on data-poor PFAS will help support a more complete understanding of the potential health effects from PFAS exposures. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

In order to do so, we conducted a search for scientific articles in Web of Science, using different search strings and focusing exclusively in studies at pilot and industrial scale. A bibliometric analysis of the retrieved works was performed, followed by a critical review of their main findings regarding the removal efficiency of regulated and emerging pollutants, and their compliance with in-ternational reuse guidelines. The bibliometric analysis suggests that public policies promoting wastewater reuse is a relevant driver behind the research and development of water reclamation technologies, and shows that most of the published research has been oriented towards technical assessments, with less reports dealing with social issues. Many of the identified processes show significant removals of conventionally regulated pollutants, and allow to meet the quality standards of international guidelines.

Even at relatively low levels of exposure, PFAS have been linked to various health effects in humans such as lower birth weight, increased serum cholesterol levels, and reduced antibody response to vaccination. Human biomonitoring data demonstrates ubiquitous exposure to PFAS across all age groups. This has been attributed to PFAS-contaminated water and dietary intake, as well as inadvertent ingestion of indoor dust for adults and toddlers. In utero exposure and breast milk have been indicated as important exposure pathways for foetuses and nursing infants.

This systematic review study, using the Scopus database, provides an insightful understanding of the spatial distribution of scientific studies on MPs in freshwater conducted across the Asian region, utilized sampling methods, and a detailed assessment of the effects of MPs on different biotic components in freshwater ecosystems, with special focus on its potential risks on human health. The results of this review indicate that research on microplastics in Asia has gained attention since 2014, with a significant increase in the number of studies in 2018, and the number of scientific studies quadrupled in 2021 compared to 2018. Results indicated that despite a significant amount of research has been conducted in many Asian countries, they were not distributed evenly, as multiple studies selected specific rivers and lakes. Additionally, around two-thirds of all the papers focused their studies in China, followed by India and South Korea. It was also found that most of the studies focused primarily on reporting the occurrence levels of MPs in freshwater systems, such as water and sediments, and aquatic organisms, with a lack of studies investigating the human intake of MPs and their potential risks to human health. Notably, comparing the results is a challenge because diverse sampling, separation, and identification methods were applied to estimate MPs. This review study suggests that further research on the dynamics and transport of microplastics in biota and humans is needed, as Asia is a major consumer of seafood products and contributes significantly to the generation of plastic litter in the marine environment. Moreover, this review study revealed that only a few studies extended their discussions to policies and governance aspects of MPs. This implies the need for further research on policy and governance frameworks to address this emerging water pollutant more holistically.",,10.3390/w14111737,Asia,NA,

Therefore, it is urgent to apply methods for the detection and removal of these pollutants. Given that antibiotics cannot be completely removed by conventional methods, developing alternative methods to enhance their removal efficiency should be the focus of researchers. Over the past decades, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have gained considerable attention owing to their remarkable merits (high surface area, low density and high thermal conductivity). However, despite the numerous advantages of CNTs, they suffer from some limitations, which can be solved by surface modification. Hence, this comprehensive review aims to help readers to improve their fundamental knowledge regarding the main characteristics of common antibiotics and their environmental and health effects, their fate in the environment, common methods for their removal, physicochemical methods for the modification of CNTs, identifying the effects of various parameters (pH, dosage, initial concentration, and time) on the removal process, and the reusability and major mechanism for the adsorption of antibiotics by CNTs. Finally, we summarize the isotherm and kinetic models for the removal of antibiotics. Our results exhibit that all the data fitted the Langmuir isotherm model, which reveals that the adsorption process on modified-CNTs is homogenous and monolayer. Furthermore, herein, the adsorption kinetics is well described by the pseudo-second-order model. Overall, this review provides useful insight for young researchers to understand the adsorption of antibiotics and achieve the future goal of using CNTs as promising adsorbents.",,10.1039/d1ew00912e,Anti-Bacterial Agents,NA,

In this study, we dem-onstrated that oral PFOS exposure (1 mu g/g BW and 5 mu g/g BW) decreased the function of the Luteinizing hormone (LH)/Luteinizing hormone receptor (LHr) and decreased epididymal sperm motility. Consistently, testicular tran-scriptome analysis revealed that PFOS altered the expression of a cluster of genes associated with sperm motility and steroidogenesis. In mice exposed to PFOS, c-Fos immunostaining showed activation of the lateral septal nucleus (LS), paraventricular thalamus (PVT), locus coeruleus (LC), which are known to be related to anxiety-like behaviors. Metabolomic analyses of the hypothalamus revealed that exposure to PFOS perturbed the translation of proteins, as well as the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.

Recent Findings Eleven studies were identified, with study populations located in the U.S., Taiwan, Japan, and the Kingdom of Denmark. Many studies (n = 5) were cross-sectional, with PFAS exposure and epigenetic outcomes measured in the same tissue collected at delivery via cord blood or dried newborn blood spots. The other six studies were prospective, with prenatal PFAS measured on maternal blood during pregnancy and DNA methylation (DNAm) assessed in cord blood and childhood peripheral leukocytes (n = 1 study). Epigenetic marks of interest included global DNAm measures (LINE-1, Alu, and an ELISA-based method), candidate genes (IFG2, H19, and MEST), and epigenome-wide DNA methylation via array-based methods (Infinium 450 K and EPIC). Two studies using array-based methods employed discovery and validation paradigms, in which a small subset of loci (n = 6 and n = 4) were replicated in the discovery population. One site (TNXB) was a hit in two independent studies. Collectively, loci associated with PFAS were in regions involved in growth and development, lipid metabolism, and nutrient metabolism. There is moderate human evidence supporting associations of prenatal PFAS exposure on DNAm at birth, with one study suggesting sustained effects into childhood. Future studies are warranted to link PFAS-associated DNAm to health outcomes, as well as to investigate the role of other epigenetic marks such as hydroxymethylation, miRNA expression, and histone modifications.",,10.1007/s40572-022-00387-z,Only Child;Child;Infant;Adolescent,NA,

In African countries like Nigeria, the evidence to inform plastic pollution management is scanty. This rapid review aimed to systematically evaluate evidence on the distribution, sources, biological effects, research gaps and policy needs of plastic pollution in various environmental matrices in Nigeria. Peer-reviewed journal articles on nano-, micro-, mesoand macroplastics contamination of water, sediment, air, soil and biota were accessed from PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct. They were screened, comprehensively revised and critically appraised for inclusion, data extraction and evidence synthesis. A total of 358,974 articles were accessed from any publication date up till May 30, 2021. Only 34 articles met the inclusion criteria and critical appraisal. Only 26 of the included studies reported the distribution, levels and/or effects of microplastics (MPs) ( n = 12), macroplastics ( n = 12) or both ( n = 2) in water, sediment, biota, food and/or land. Only 15 of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory had any data on micro- and/or macroplastics. Macroplastics from land-based sources were mainly reported from educational institutions, residential areas and markets. Plastic sources reported were tire wear, cigarette butts, fishing ropes and gears, plastic bags, water sachets and e-wastes. Biological effects (oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, reduced plant root biomass) of virgin MPs were reported in crab, African catfish and lime tree only in laboratory experiments. Microplastic data in biota were limited to selected fish species, aquatic insects and gastropods. Only one (1) study on plastics in waterbodies in Northern Nigeria (Kogi State) was found. Research gaps on plastic distribution in terrestrial biota, other aquatic biota, soil, air, ground and potable water sources as well as biological effects were identified. Policy needs for plastic pollution management identified include stakeholder education, polymer replacement, recycling, tax and incentives to support the sustainability of life below water and on land (UN SDGs 14 and 15).

Fluoropolymers possess a unique combination of properties and unmatched functional performance critical to the products and manufacturing processes they enable and are irreplaceable in many uses. Fluoropolymers have documented safety profiles; are thermally, biologically, and chemically stable, negligibly soluble in water, nonmobile, nonbioavailable, nonbioaccumulative, and nontoxic. Although fluoropolymers fit the PFAS structural definition, they have very different physical, chemical, environmental, and toxicological properties when compared with other PFAS. This study describes the composition, uses, performance properties, and functionalities of 14 fluoropolymers, including fluoroplastics and fluoroelastomers, and presents data to demonstrate that they satisfy the widely accepted polymer hazard assessment criteria to be considered polymers of low concern (PLC). The PLC criteria include physicochemical properties, such as molecular weight, which determine bioavailability and warn of potential hazard. Fluoropolymers are insoluble (e.g., water, octanol) solids too large to migrate into the cell membrane making them nonbioavailable, and therefore, of low concern from a human and environmental health standpoint. Further, the study results demonstrate that fluoropolymers are a distinct and different group of PFAS and should not be grouped with other PFAS for hazard assessment or regulatory purposes. When combined with an earlier publication by Henry et al., this study demonstrates that commercial fluoropolymers are available from the seven participating companies that meet the criteria to be considered PLC, which represent approximately 96% of the global commercial fluoropolymer market.

Many women endure PFD symptoms without seeking care. The Andersen's health behavior model explains health service utilization (HSU) using 4 domains: (1) individual needs for care, (2) resources or enabling factors, (3) predisposing factors, and (4) macrostructural/contextual factors. This study aims to apply this model to PFDs to determine the rate of HSUs in American women experiencing PFDs. The secondary objective was to examine HSU behavior using a variation of Andersen's model: the authors limited outcome variables to that of accessing PFD health services by any health care provider. As the normal Andersen's health behavior model covers broad personal health practices and general health behavior, this modification allowed for increased precision of individual predictors and relevance to urogynecology.        Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, the authors conducted a systematic review of literature on PubMed, using search terms relevant to PFDs (in addition to disparities in care access). Included were studies of community-dwelling PFD symptomatic women living in the United States and quantitative and qualitative studies with primary and/or secondary aims addressing care-seeking or HSU behavior. For this study, PFDs were defined as AI, LUTSs, and POP. Extracted data were as follows: first author's last name, study aim, year of publication, study population geographic location, study participant demographics, PFD types, insurance, number of care-seekers and/or non-care-seekers, participant age, race/ethnicity, education, income, employment, body mass index, general health status, language used in study, symptoms, and other barriers and/or promotors identified.        Overall, 44 publications were found that met the criteria of the study. Of these, 36 were quantitative, 5 were qualitative, and 3 were mixed-methods studies. The predominant focus of these studies was LUTSs (33/44 studies), whereas only 2 were on POP, 5 onmultiple PFDs, and 4 onAI. More than half were publishedmore than a decade ago (25/44), and themajority were based on self-reporting to national surveys. Women with symptomatic PFDs exhibited a 37% pooled prevalence of HSU, with determinants identified across the first 3 domains in the model only (macrostructural domains associated with HSU were not identified).        For the first domain, quantitative studies demonstrated that PFD symptom severity and duration and preexisting depression were individual care needs associated with greater HSU behavior. Consistent with the quantitative data available in this study, qualitative data also demonstrated that facilitators of HSU were (1) longer symptom duration and (2) negative impact of PFD on quality of life.        For the resources domain, established primary or secondary care and social support/networks increased HSU behaviors, but (oddly) higher income and employment were barriers to care. Of note, home remedy utilization was identified as a barrier to HSU in this category (taking of herbal supplements, use of diapers, and other self-management strategies).        Predisposing factors noted to increase HSU in this study were age older than 50 years. Minority women were not well represented in this analysis, but notably, Asian women were significantly less likely to demonstrate HSU related to PFD. Qualitatively, there were no differences in socioeconomic status of women who did or did not show HSU, but the most common facilitator was awareness of PFD treatments, and common barriers included misinformation and normalization of pelvic floor symptoms.        Limitations of this study include the possibility of missed publications with relevance (such as articles involving interstitial cystitis, sexual dysfunction, birth trauma, and others, as they are important aspects of PFDs). However, the team focused on studies related to common PFDs and their HSU, as opposed to peripheral analyses or pelvic floor conditions. Second, the study may be limited by using counts of themes and numbers of reporting studies in the overall qualitative analysis. Finally, significant heterogeneity in the studies indicates caution should be used in interpreting the operating room and pooled HSU rate for each identified determinant.        The study indicates that designing inclusive interventions, building upon previous research frameworks, and addressing multilayered factors are all required for improving care-seeking rates of women with PFDs. To mitigate the glaring inequity in the United States of access to pelvic floor care, the authors recommend research focused on HSU for patients with POP or AI, implementation of multifaceted interventions, and investigations into macrostructural factors affecting HSU.",,10.1097/OGX.0000000000001115,United States;Pelvic Floor;Health Services,NA,

To address this need, 113 participants among households served by a range of water providers across the Guatemala City metropolitan area were recruited as participatory scientists to collect first-draw and flushed tap water samples at their residence. Samples were transported to the U.S. and analyzed for 20 metals and 25 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). At least one metal exceeded the Guatemalan Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) for drinking water in 63% of households (n = 71). Arsenic and lead exceeded the MPL in 33.6% (n = 38) and 8.9% (n = 10) of samples, respectively. Arsenic was strongly associated with groundwater while lead occurrence was not associated with location, water source, or provider. One or more PFAS were detected in 19% of samples (n = 21, range 2.1-64.2 ppt). PFAS were significantly associated with the use of plastic water storage tanks but not with location, water source, or provider. Overall, the high prevalence of arsenic above the MPL in Guatemala City tap water represents a potential health risk that current water treatment processes are not optimized to remove.

However, the clinical profile of C8 radiculopathy is not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the rate of C8 radiculopathy after cervicothoracic osteotomies and to form a clinical profile describing the characteristics through a systematic review of the literature.        METHODS: An electronic database search for full-text English articles was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. The search yielded results on indications for cervicothoracic osteotomies, surgical approaches, mean follow-up time, and significant complications, including C8 radiculopathy.        RESULTS: Our literature search yielded 2135 articles, of which 12 qualified to be included in the analysis. The 12 articles comprised 451 patients undergoing various osteotomy approaches. The mean age of subjects was 51.0 years (range, 11.4-63.2 years), and the majority of patients were male (66%, n = 298). Ankylosing spondylitis was the most frequent indication for surgery (44.8%, n = 202).

Xenobiotic metabolism, transformation, excretion, and coexistence with other endogenous molecules, however, greatly complicate the interpretation of features detected in nontargeted studies. While mass spectrometry (MS)-based platforms are commonly used in metabolomic measurements, deconvoluting endogenous metabolites from xenobiotics is also often challenged by the lack of xenobiotic parent and metabolite standards as well as the numerous isomers possible for each small molecule m/z feature. Here, we evaluate a xenobiotic structural annotation workflow using ion mobility spectrometry coupled with MS (IMS-MS), mass defect filtering, and machine learning to uncover potential xenobiotic classes and species in large metabolomic feature lists. Xenobiotic classes examined included those of known high toxicities, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and pesticides. Specifically, when the workflow was applied to identify PFAS in the NIST SRM 1957 and 909c human serum samples, it greatly reduced the hundreds of detected liquid chromatography (LC)-IMS-MS features by utilizing both mass defect filtering and m/z versus IMS collision cross sections relationships. These potential PFAS features were then compared to the EPA CompTox entries, and while some matched within specific m/z tolerances, there were still many unknowns illustrating the importance of nontargeted studies for detecting new molecules with known chemical characteristics. Additionally, this workflow can also be utilized to evaluate other xenobiotics and enable more confident annotations from nontargeted studies.",,10.1021/acs.est.2c00201,Xenobiotics,NA,

This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of educational interventions and verbal instructions on how to contract and exercise the PFMs to improve the proprioception of the PFMs in women. A systematic search of studies published in the last 20 years until March 2022 was conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, PEDro, Lilacs, and Dialnet databases. A meta-analysis could not be performed due to the heterogeneity in the types of studies and included populations. This review followed the PRISMA guidelines for the design, search, and reporting of studies. The methodological quality was analysed via the PEDro and the Newcastle-Ottawa scales in the case of randomised clinical trials and non-randomised studies, respectively, while the quality of evidence was determined using the SIGN grading system for evidence-based guidelines. Descriptive and experimental studies published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese that evaluated the contractile capability of the PFMs in healthy women or women without a previous diagnosis of PFD were included. Seven articles that included a total of 2507 women were found, three of which were clinical trials with PEDro scores between 5 and 9 points out of 10 and four of which were non-randomised studies with NOS scores between 6 and 8 points out of 10. The outcomes were measured through vaginal palpation, visual observation, questionnaires for PFD symptoms, and self-perception reports. This review discriminated between two types of intervention, educational programmes and verbal instructions, and evaluated the changes observed in PFM strength and knowledgeability and the symptoms of PFDs. The findings showed that educational interventions and verbal instructions improve the proprioception of PFMs in women of all ages that are healthy or without a previous diagnosis of PFDs as well as their knowledge about the pelvic floor, healthy lifestyle habits, and symptoms that are potentially indicative of PFDs. Further high-quality randomised clinical trials are warranted to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of educational interventions to improve the proprioception of the PFMs in women considered healthy or with mild symptoms that may be indicative of PFDs.",,10.3390/ijerph19159308,Pelvic Floor,NA,

Remediation of environmental PFAS contamination and their presence in consumer products have led to the production of solid and liquid waste streams containing high concentrations of PFASs, which require efficient and cost-effective treatment solutions. PFASs are challenging to defluorinate by conventional and advanced destructive treatment processes, and physical separation processes produce waste streams (e.g., membrane concentrate, spent activated carbon) requiring further post-treatment. Incineration and other thermal treatment processes are widely available, but their use in managing PFAS-containing wastes remains poorly understood. Under specific operating conditions, thermal treatment is expected to mineralize PFASs, but the degradation mechanisms and pathways are unknown. In this review, we critically evaluate the thermal decomposition mechanisms, pathways, and byproducts of PFASs that are crucial to the design and operation of thermal treatment processes. We highlight the analytical capabilities and challenges and identify research gaps which limit the current understanding of safely applying thermal treatment to destroy PFASs as a viable end-of-life treatment process. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

However, they also pose an environmental and health concern given their ability to undergo hydrolysis and oxidation to several bioactive and persistent products, including the perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). The metabolism of PAPs has been shown to occur in mammalian liver and intestine, however metabolism by the gut microbiome has not yet been investigated. In this study, human fecal samples were used to model the microbial population of the colon, to test whether these anaerobic microbes could facilitate 8:2 monosubstituted PAP (monoPAP) transformation. In vitro testing was completed by incubating the fecal samples with 8:2 monoPAP (400-10,000 nM) up to 120 minutes in an anaerobic chamber. Reactions were then terminated and the samples prepared for GC- and LC-MS/MS analysis. Metabolites of interest were the immediate hydrolysis product, the 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH), and 11 additional metabolites previously shown to form from 8:2 FTOH in both oxic and anoxic environments. The kinetics of 8:2 monoPAP transformation by gut microbiota were compared to those in human S9 liver and intestine fractions, both of which have active levels of hydrolyzing and oxidative enzymes that transform 8:2 monoPAP. Transformation rates from 8:2 monoPAP to 8:2 FTOH were highest in liver S9 > intestine S9 > fecal suspensions. The gut microbiome also produced a unique composition of oxidative metabolites, where the following intermediate metabolites were more abundant than terminal PFCAs: 8:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid (FTUCA) > 8:2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (FTCA) > 7:2 Ketone approximate to perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). Hydrolytic and oxidative metabolites contributed up to 30% of the molar balance after microbial 8:2 monoPAP transformation. Together, the results suggest that the gut microbiome can play a notable role in PAP biotransformation.",,10.1039/d2em00225f,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Biotransformation;Surface-Active Agents,NA,

Drug-induced platelet function bleeding disorders are the most frequent PFDs and can easily be identified on the basis of recent administration of platelet-inhibiting drugs. Apart from these, the most challenging acquired PFDs are those caused by autoimmune mechanisms. In fact, demonstration of autoantibodies inhibiting platelet function may be difficult in most non-specialised centres. Among autoimmune PFDs (aPFDs), acquired Glanzmann thrornbasthenia (aGT), which is caused by autoantibodies that bind to platelet alpha llb beta 3 integrin, inhibiting its function, is the most frequent. aGT can be associated with underlying haematological malignancies or autoimmune diseases but can also be idiopathic. More rarely, other immune-mediated PFDs can occur, such as acquired delta storage pool disease (a delta SPD).

Elucidation of the role of environmental factors in metabolic and immune dysfunction leading to autoimmune disease is not yet well characterized. Objectives Here we investigated the impact of exposure to a mixture of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on the metabolome in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, an experimental model of T1D. The mixture contained organochlorides, organobromides, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Methods Analysis of molecular lipids (lipidomics) and bile acids in serum samples was performed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, while polar metabolites were analyzed by GC-Q-TOF/MS. Results Experimental exposure to the POP mixture in these mice led to several metabolic changes, which were similar to those previously reported as associated with PFAS exposure, as well as risk of T1D in human studies. This included an increase in the levels of sugar derivatives, triacylglycerols and lithocholic acid, and a decrease in long chain fatty acids and several lipid classes, including phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins.

Methods: Relevant studies from their inception to November 2021 were identified by searching EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. The cohort and case-control studies that reported effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of EDC exposure and GDM were selected. The heterogeneity among the included studies was quantified by I-2 statistic. Publication bias was evaluated through the Begg and Egger tests.        Results: Twenty-five articles with a total of 23,796 participants were found. Results indicated that exposure to PCBs has a significant influence on the incidence of GDM (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.00--1.31; n = 8). The risk of GDM was found to be associated with PBDE exposure (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.15-1.53; n = 4). PAEs and PFASs exposure were also positively associated with the risk of GDM, with summary ORs of 1.10 (95% CI = 1.03-1.16; n = 7 for PAEs) and 1.09 (95% CI = 1.02-1.16; n = 11 for PFASs), respectively. When only cohort studies were considered, the summary OR between PCBs exposure and the risk of GDM was 0.99 (95% CI = 0.91-1.09; n = 5). Meanwhile, the summary ORs from cohort studies for PBDEs, PAEs, and PFASs exposure were 1.12 (95% CI = 1.00-1.26; n = 2), 1.08 (95% CI = 1.02-1.15; n = 5), and 1.06 (95% CI = 1.00-1.12; n = 8), respectively. The Beggs and Egger tests did not show publication bias, and the sensitivity analyses did not change the results in this meta-analysis.        Conclusion: These results support that exposure to certain EDCs, including PCBs, PBDEs, PAEs, and PFAS, increase the risk of GDM. Further large-sample epidemiologic researches and mechanistic studies are needed to verify the potential relationship and biological mechanisms. These results are of public health significance because the daily EDC exposure is expected to increase the risk of GDM development.",,10.1186/s12940-022-00858-8,"Pregnancy;Diabetes, Gestational",NA,

Many studies have considered microbiota as critical regulators of the gut-brain axis. The crosstalk between microbiota and the central nervous system is mainly explained through three different pathways: the neural, endocrine, and immune pathways, intricately interconnected with each other. In day-to-day life, human beings are exposed to a wide variety of contaminants that affect our intestinal microbiota and alter the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, causing neuronal disorders. The interplay between xenobiotics, microbiota and neurotoxicity is still not fully explored, especially for susceptible populations such as pregnant women, neonates, and developing children.

The research on atmospheric microplastics (AMPs) started later than that on the MPs in soil and water, but AMPs' potential environmental impacts are explored in an even wider range. Based on the literatures on AMPs since 2015 as well as those about MPs in water and soil, this paper systematically reviews the distribution, source, transport of AMPS and the environmental and ecological impacts of AMPs. The results show that AMPs are distributed in global atmosphere, and have been detected in the atmosphere of urban, suburban, remote areas and indoor air. The concentrations of AMPs were detected in a range 2 to 77000 n m(-2) d(-1) or 0 to 1583 n m(-3). The distribution characteristics of MPs in atmosphere are affected by environmental factors such as indoor and outdoor environment, underlying surface type and airflow, etc. In general, the concentration and the diversity of AMPs' shape and composition are higher in the places near to MPs the source, but the wind, precipitation and even local animals could reshape the characters of AMPs. The sources of AMPs are mainly the production, use and recycling processes of plastic products, as well as land and sea where MPs accumulated. Studies also showed that abrasion of vehicle tires and the use of synthetic textile are major sources. What's noteworthy is that the COVID-19 pandemic has made masks as necessities of life, which indirectly exacerbated the pollution of AMPs. The transport of MPs can occur in atmospheric environment, such as suspension, deposition and diffusion, and is affected by the morphology of MPs, wind direction, precipitation and other atmospheric factors. The diffusion of MPs in atmosphere, also known as atmospheric transport, is an important part of the global plastic cycle. AMPs' transport path is mostly studied of Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) by conducting backward trajectory simulation, and their transport volume is estimated mainly through deposition and aerodynamic model. In addition, AMPs have unique physical and chemical properties, which can affect regional atmospheric environmental quality, change regional and global climate. It could also adsorb heavy metals, organic pollutants and harmful microorganisms during transport, resulting in greater health risks to human. Also, AMPs could affect atmospheric ecosystems through food chains and providing microbial niches, and alter structure and functions of terrestrial forest and water ecosystems through deposition. There are still some unsolved scientific and technical questions. Due to the lack of standardized sampling and identification means, the past research methods on AMPs are different on sampling and physical analysis, which make information comparison difficult. The observations of AMPs' environmental behaviors, the atmospheric transport, source attribution and trans-regional effects of AMPs are still limited. Therefore, some conclusions from laboratory researches cannot fully explain the uncertainty of in natural environment. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that future scientific research on AMPs should focus on standardization of research methods, the establishment of source list, transport mechanism and environmental and ecological impacts.        It is necessary for the study of AMPs to establish a set of scientifically credible and technically feasible monitoring techniques as well. Because AMPs could be transported to different ecosystems and could enter the human body through a variety of ways, it is urgent to study the physiological and ecological status of human body and ecosystems which are continuously exposed to AMPs pollution.",,10.1360/TB-2021-1236,,NA,

Surgical treatment is the optimal strategy for managing intertrochanteric fractures as it allows early rehabilitation and functional recovery. The relative effects of internal fixation strategies for intertrochanteric fracture after operation remain limited to relatively small studies which create uncertainty in attempts to establish evidence-based best practice.        Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies to assess the clinical effectiveness of two commonly used intramedullary devices: a twin-screw integrated cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) versus a single-screw cephalomedullary nail (proximal femoral nail antirotation) in patients with intertrochanteric fractures. The following outcomes were considered: revisions, implant-related failures, non-unions, pain, Harris hip score and intra-operative outcomes. Odds ratios or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals in brackets are reported.        Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria: two randomised controlled trials and four observational studies enrolling 970 patients with a mean age of 77 years and 64% of patients being female. There was a statistically significant difference (p value < 0.05) for revisions OR 0.27 (0.13-0.56), implant-related failures OR 0.16 (0.09-0.27) and proportion of patients complaining of pain OR 0.50 (0.34-0.74).

In this work, we summarized the factors influencing the catalytic activity and stability of various catalysts, the strategies for optimizing catalytic performance and product distribution, the effects of reaction conditions on catalytic performance, and possible reaction mechanisms for CO2 hydrogenation via the FTS route. Furthermore, we also provided an overview of the challenges and opportunities for future research associated with hydrogenation of CO2 to liquid fuels and aromatics.",,10.3390/atmos13081238,Hydrogen;Carbon Dioxide;Bicarbonates;Hydrogenation,NA,

Compared with biological, physical, and chemical methods, electrocatalytic oxidation technology has the advantages of a strong oxidation ability, high efficiency, mild reaction conditions, and high automation. The direct and indirect electrochemical oxidation mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxidation processes are discussed. The generation processes and properties of oxidative species in indirect electrochemical oxidation processes, including hydroxyl radicals, active chlorine, sulfate radicals, O-3, H2O2, carbonate radicals, and O-1(2), are summarized. The cell designs involved in the flow-by, flow-through, and three-dimensional configurations are outlined. The removal ratios, intermediate products, and electrocatalytic oxidation mechanisms of halogenated pollutants, including perfluorinated, polyfluorinated, chlorinated, brominated, and iodinated organic compounds, are reviewed. The oxidative and mineralization ability, detoxification ability, and energy consumptions of electrocatalytic oxidation compared with other technologies are comprehensively evaluated. This Review are intended to introduce some effective strategies for lowering energy consumption in electrocatalytic oxidation processes.

In this context, the article reviews the occurrence, transport, fate, and electrochemical removal of some selected NSAIDs (diclofenac (DIC), ketoprofen (KTP), ibuprofen (IBU), and naproxen (NPX)) using carbon-based anodes in the aquatic environment. However, no specific protocol has been developed to date, and various approaches have been adopted for the sampling and elimination processes of NSAIDs from wastewater samples. The mean concentration of selected NSAIDs from different countries varies considerably, ranging between 3992-27,061 mu g/L (influent wastewater) and 1208-7943 mu g/L (effluent wastewater). An assessment of NSAIDs removal efficiency across different treatment stages in various wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been performed. Overall, NSAIDs removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants has been reported to be around 4-89%, 8-100%, 16-100%, and 17-98% for DIC, KTP, NPX, and IBU, respectively. A microbiological reactor (MBR) has been proclaimed to be the most reliable treatment technique for NSAIDs removal (complete removal). Chlorination (81-95%) followed by conventional mechanical biological treatment (CMBT) (94-98%) treatment has been demonstrated to be the most efficient in removing NSAIDs. Further, the present review explains that the electrochemical oxidation process is an alternative process for the treatment of NSAIDs using a carbon-based anode. Different carbon-based carbon anodes have been searched for electrochemical removal of selected NSAIDs. However, boron-doped diamond and graphite have presented reliable applications for the complete removal of NSAIDs from wastewater samples or their aqueous solution.",,10.3390/toxics10100598,,NA,

Humans are continuously exposed to POPs through diet, air particles, and household and commercial products; POPs are consistently detected in human tissues, including the pancreas. Epidemiological studies show a modest but consistent correlation between exposure to POPs and increased diabetes risk. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of epidemiological evidence and an in-depth evaluation of the in vivo and in vitro evidence that POPs cause β-cell toxicity. We review evidence for six classes of POPs: dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), organophosphate pesticides (OPPs), flame retardants, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The available data provide convincing evidence implicating POPs as a contributing factor driving impaired glucose homeostasis, β-cell dysfunction, and altered metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in islets. These findings support epidemiological data showing that POPs increase diabetes risk and emphasize the need to consider the endocrine pancreas in toxicity assessments. Our review also highlights significant gaps in the literature assessing islet-specific endpoints after both in vivo and in vitro POP exposure. In addition, most rodent studies do not consider the impact of biological sex or secondary metabolic stressors in mediating the effects of POPs on glucose homeostasis and β-cell function. We discuss key gaps and limitations that should be assessed in future studies. Copyright © 2022 the American Physiological Society.",,10.1152/ajpendo.00358.2021,,NA,

We examined the potential causal role of acylcarnitine metabolism in depression by leveraging genomics and Mendelian randomization. Methods: Summary statistics were obtained from large GWAS: the Fenland Study (N = 9363), and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (246,363 depression cases and 561,190 controls). Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses tested the potential causal link of 15 endogenous acylcarnitines with depression. Results: In univariable analyses, genetically-predicted lower levels of short-chain acylcarnitines C2 (odds ratio [OR] 0.97, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 0.95-1.00) and C3 (OR 0.97, 95%CIs 0.96-0.99) and higher levels of medium-chain acylcarnitines C8 (OR 1.04, 95%CIs 1.01-1.06) and C10 (OR 1.04, 95%CIs 1.02-1.06) were associated with increased depression risk. No reverse potential causal role of depression genetic liability on acylcarnitines levels was found. Multivariable analyses showed that the association with depression was driven by the medium-chain acylcarnitines C8 (OR 1.04, 95%CIs 1.02-1.06) and C10 (OR 1.04, 95%CIs 1.02-1.06), suggesting a potential causal role in the risk of depression. Causal estimates for C8 (OR = 1.05, 95%CIs = 1.02-1.07) and C10 (OR = 1.05, 95%CIs = 1.02-1.08) were confirmed in follow-up analyses using genetic instruments derived from a GWAS meta-analysis including up to 16,841 samples. Discussion: Accumulation of medium-chain acylcarnitines is a signature of inborn errors of fatty acid metabolism and age-related metabolic conditions. Our findings point to a link between altered mitochondrial energy production and depression pathogenesis.

Immunomodulation and epigenetic regulation have been hypothesized as mediators of this relationship, but the precise underlying molecular mechanisms are not well-characterized. This review examines the evidence for epigenetic modification at the intersection of COVID-19 and environmental chemical exposures. Recent Findings Numerous environmental contaminants including air pollutants, toxic metal(loid)s, per- and polyfluorinated substances, and endocrine disrupting chemicals are hypothesized to increase susceptibility to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the risk of severe COVID-19, but few studies currently exist. Drawing on evidence that many environmental chemicals alter the epigenetic regulation of key immunity genes and pathways, we discuss how exposures likely perturb host antiviral responses. Specific mechanisms vary by contaminant but include general immunomodulation as well as regulation of viral entry and recognition, inflammation, and immunologic memory pathways, among others. Associations between environmental contaminants and COVID-19 are likely mediated, in part, by epigenetic regulation of key immune pathways involved in the host response to SARS-CoV-2.",,10.1007/s40572-022-00353-9,Epigenomics,NA,

Microbial communities from anaerobic wastewater sludge, an anaerobic digester, and anaerobic dechlorinating cultures enriched from aquifer materials reductively dechlorinated 6:2 ClPFESA to 6:2 hydrogen-substituted polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (6:2 H-PFESA), which was identified as the sole metabolite by non-target analysis. Rapid and complete reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was achieved by the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures. The microbial community of the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures was impacted by 6:2 Cl-PFESA exposure. Organohalide-respiring bacteria originally present in the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures, including Geobacter, Dehalobacter, and Dehalococcoides, decreased in relative abundance over time. As the relative abundance of organohalide-respiring bacteria decreased, the rates of 6:2 Cl-PFESA dechlorination decreased, suggesting that the most likely mechanism for reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was co-metabolism rather than organohalide respiration. Reductive defluorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was not observed. Furthermore, 6:2 H-PFESA exhibited 5.5 times lower sorption affinity to the suspended biosolids than 6:2 Cl-PFESA, with the prospect of increased mobility in the environment. These results show the susceptibility of 6:2 Cl-PFESA to microbially mediated reductive dechlorination and the likely persistence of the product, 6:2 H-PFESA, in anaerobic environments.",,10.1021/acs.est.1c05475,Sulfones;Ethers;Ether,NA,

The most currently used dynamic hip screw (DHS) and the proximal femoral nail (PFN) are both with pros and cons. We aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of these interventions for trochanteric fractures by evaluating the surgical performance and postoperative outcomes. Methods PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register were searched for RCTs comparing DHS and PFN for trochanteric fractures. All selected studies and the risk of bias were assessed. Clinical data including operative time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative fluoroscopy time, successful closed reduction and complications like nonunion, implant failure and reoperation were recorded. Random-effects models were used in Review Manager software, and GRADE was applied for the interpretation of the evidence. Results From 286 identified trials, twelve RCTs including 1889 patients were eligible for inclusion; six RCTs directly comparing DHS with PFN, while other six compared DHS with proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA). Compared to DHS, PFN had shorter operative time and led to less intraoperative blood loss. However, DHS need less intraoperative fluoroscopy time than PFN. No difference was seen for the achievement of closed reduction. For risk of postoperative complications, no difference was seen between PFN and DHS for non-union, risk of implant failure and revision surgery. Conclusions PFN(A) resulted in a shorter operative time and less intraoperative blood loss compared to DHS. However, no difference was seen for postoperative complications.

The Workshop arose from a previous workshop organized by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in 2008 and which also drew on case studies from the EEA reports on 'Late Lessons from Early Warnings' (2001, 2013). These reports documented dozens of hazardous agents including many chemicals, for which risk reduction measures were delayed for decades after scientists and others had issued early and later warnings about the harm likely to be caused by those agents. Results: Workshop participants used recent case studies including Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), Extremely Low Frequency - Electrical Magnetic Fields (ELF-EMF fields), glyphosate, and Bisphenol A (BPA) to explore myriad reasons for divergent outcomes of evaluations, which has led to delayed and inadequate protection of the public's health. Strategies to overcome these barriers must, therefore, at a minimum include approaches that 1) Make better use of existing data and information, 2) Ensure timeliness, 3) Increase transparency, consistency and minimize bias in evidence evaluations, and 4) Minimize the influence of financial conflicts of interest.

This review aims to systematically review the existing literature and identify instruments that measure pain in women with POP and SUI for inclusion within the APFPR, which reports on complications from these conditions.        Methods We conducted a literature search on OVID MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EMCARE databases in addition to Google Scholar and grey literature to identify studies from inception to April 2021. Full-text studies were included if they used PROMs to measure pain in women with POP and SUI. Two authors independently screened articles, extracted data and assessed methodological quality.        Results From 2001 studies, 23 publications describing 19 different PROMs were included for analysis. Eight of these instruments were specific to the pelvic floor; four were only specific to pain and used across multiple disorders; three were generic quality of life instruments and four were other non-validated instruments such as focus group interviews. These instruments were not specific to pain in women with POP or SUI, as they did not identify all relevant domains such as the sensation, region and duration of pain, or incidents where onset of pain occurs.

The diverse profile of compounds includes mainly B-type procyanidins (especially C4 -> C8 linked molecules) and the key monomers, catechin, and epicatechin that are positively implicated in the 'French Paradox'. Today grape seed nutraceuticals have become a multi-million-dollar industry. This has created incentives to elucidate the variations in chemistry across cultivars, to identify signs of adulteration, and to understand the intrinsic and extrinsic factors controlling the expression of metabolites in the seeds' metabolome. This review provides a critical overview of the existing literature on grape seed chemistry. Although the biosynthetic pathways for polymeric procyanidins in seeds have not yet been explained, abiotic factors have been shown to modulate associated genes. Research of extrinsic factors has demonstrated that the control of procyanidin expression is strongly influenced, in order of importance, by genotype (species first, then variety) and environment, as claimed anecdotally. Unfortunately, research outcomes on the effects of abiotic factors have low certainty, because effects can be specific to genotype or variety, and there is limited control over physical metrics in the field. Thus, to gain a fuller understanding of the effects of abiotic factors and biosynthetic pathways, and realise potential for optimisation, a more fundamental research approach is needed.

Sarcopenia overlaps with the physical domain of frailty, and most existing studies have analyzed the associated factors of frailty and sarcopenia as an isolated state. Perturbations in metabolism may play an important role in the presence of frailty or sarcopenia; however, the metabolites associated with frailty, especially overlapping with sarcopenia remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore whether amino acids, carnitines, acylcarnitines and lysophosphatidylcholines, as specific panels, are significantly correlated with frailty, especially overlapping with sarcopenia, to gain insight into potential biomarkers and possible biological mechanisms and to facilitate their management. MethodsWe applied a targeted high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach in serum samples from 246 Chinese older men (age 79.2 +/- 7.8 years) with frailty (n = 150), non-frailty (n = 96), frailty and sarcopenia (n = 52), non-frail and non-sarcopenic control (n = 85). Frailty was evaluated using Freid phenotype criteria, sarcopenia was defined by diagnostic algorithm of Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia, and the participants were diagnosed as frailty and sarcopenia when they met the evaluation criteria of both frailty and sarcopenia. A panel of 29 metabolomic profiles was assayed and included different classes of amino acids, carnitines, acylcarnitines, and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). Multivariate logistic regression was used to screen the metabolic factors contributing to frailty status, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis was used to explore important factors and distinguish different groups. ResultsIn older men demonstrating the frail phenotype, amino acid perturbations included lower tryptophan and higher glycine levels. With regard to lipid metabolism, the frailty phenotype was characterized by lower concentrations of isovalerylcarnitine (C5), LPC16:0 and LPC18:2, while higher levels of octanoyl-L-carnitine (C8), decanoyl-L-carnitine (C10), dodecanoyl-L-carnitine (C12) and tetradecanoyl-L-carnitine (C14). After adjusting for several clinical confounders, tryptophan, LPC18:2, LPC 16:0 and C5 were negatively correlated with frailty, and C8 and C12 were positively related to frailty. We preliminarily identified metabolic profiles (LPC16:0, LPC18:2, glycine and tryptophan) that may distinguish older men with frailty from those without frailty. Importantly, a set of serum amino acids and LPCs (LPC16:0, LPC18:2, and tryptophan) was characterized in the metabotype of older adults with an overlap of frailty and sarcopenia. The metabolites that were most discriminating of frailty status implied that the underlying mechanism might be involved in antioxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction. ConclusionsThese present metabolic analyses may provide valuable information on the potential biomarkers and possible biological mechanisms of frailty, and overlapping sarcopenia. The findings obtained may offer insight into their management in older adults.",,10.3389/fmed.2022.816045,Antioxidants,NA,

There is still little evidence on which is the best FT option in kidney graft neoplasms and on its therapeutic indications. We performed a systematic review to assess the role of FT such as thermal ablation, interventional radiotherapy, electrochemotherapy, and stereotactic body radiotherapy, as alternative to NSS in the treatment of Stage I kidney cancer.

The unique ultrastructures that support cell-cell interactions in the testis are the basal ES (ectoplas-mic specialization) and the apical ES. The basal ES is found between adjacent Sertoli cells near the basement membrane that also constitute the blood-testis barrier (BTB). The apical ES is restrictively expressed at the Sertoli-spermatid contact site in the apical (adluminal) compartment of the sem-iniferous epithelium. These ultrastructures are present in both rodent and human testes, but the majority of studies found in the literature were done in rodent testes. As such, our discussion herein, unless otherwise specified, is focused on studies in testes of adult rats. Studies have shown that the testicular cell-cell interactions crucial to support spermatogenesis are mediated through distinctive signaling proteins and pathways, most notably involving FAK, Akt1/2 and Cdc42 GTPase. Thus, manipulation of some of these signaling proteins, such as FAK, through the use of phosphomimetic mutants for overexpression in Sertoli cell epithelium in vitro or in the testis in vivo, making FAK either constitutively active or inactive, we can modify the outcome of spermatogenesis. For instance, using the toxicant-induced Sertoli cell or testis injury in rats as study models, we can either block or rescue toxicant-induced infertility through overexpression of p-FAK-Y397 or p-FAK-Y407 (and their mutants), including the use of specific activator(s) of the involved signaling proteins against pAkt1/2. These findings thus illustrate that a potential therapeutic approach can be developed to manage toxicant-induced male reproductive dysfunction. In this review, we critically evaluate these recent findings, highlighting the direction for future investigations by bringing the laboratory-based research through a translation path to clinical investigations. © 2022 by the authors.

This highlights the need for understanding the impact of such application on the reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes in poultry gut and devising means to circumvent the potential resistome expansion. Phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) are potential natural alternative to antibiotic to improve animal health and performance, supposedly via positively affecting the gut microbial ecosystem, but there is little systematic information available. In this time-course study, we applied a shotgun meta-transcriptomics approach to investigate the impact of a PFA product as well as the commonly used antibiotic, zinc bacitracin either at AGP concentration or therapeutic concentration on the gut microbiome and resistome of broiler chickens raised for 35 days. Over the course of the trial, PFA treatments increased the abundance of Firmicutes such as Lactobacillus and resulted in a lower abundance of Escherichia, while the latter group increased significantly in the feces of chickens that received either AGP or AB doses of bacitracin. Tetracycline resistance and aminoglycoside resistance were the predominant antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) classes found, regardless of the treatment. PFA application resulted in a decrease in abundance of ARGs compared to those in the control group and other antibiotic treatment groups. In summary, the findings from this study demonstrate the potential of phytogenic feed additives could be an alternative to antibiotics in poultry farming, with the added benefit of counteracting antimicrobial resistance development.",,10.3389/fmicb.2022.833790,Anti-Bacterial Agents;Chickens,NA,

The primary sources of CECs in farmlands are agricultural inputs, such as wastewater, biosolids, sewage sludge, and agricultural mulching films. The percent increase in cropland area during 1950-2016 was 30 and the rise in land use for food crops during 1960-2018 was 100-500%, implying that there could be a significant CEC burden in farmlands in the future. In fact, the alarming concentrations (mu g kg(-1)) of certain CECs such as PBDEs, PAEs, and PFOS that occur in farmlands are 383, 35 400 and 483, respectively. Also, metal nanoparticles are reported even at the mg kg(-1) level. Chronic root accumulation followed by translocation of CECs into plants results in their detectable concentrations in the final plant produce. Thus, there is a continuous flow of CECs from farmlands to agricultural produce, causing a serious threat to the terrestrial food chain. Consequently, CECs find their way to the human body directly through CEC-laden plant produce or indirectly via the meat of grazing animals. Thus, human health could be at the most critical risk since several CECs have been shown to cause cancers, disruption of endocrine and cognitive systems, maternal-foetal transfer, neurotoxicity, and genotoxicity.

Characterizing its chemical compositions and source contributions is a critical prerequisite for effective control of PM2.5 pollution. This paper systematically reviews the sampling methods, chemical compositions, and source apportionments of PM2.5. Sampling methods have significant influences on the identification of chemical compositions and source contributions, with Quartz and Teflon filters being the most widely used. Receptor models are commonly adopted for identifying the sources of PM2.5, such as positive matrix factorization, chemical mass balance, principal component analysis, and UNMIX models, which have their respective advantages and limitations that determine their applications. The variations of PM2.5 compositions and sources in the past two decades in Beijing are also reviewed, which is the political, economic, and cultural center of China and is experiencing severe haze pollution events frequently. It was found that organic matters were the largest component (28.2%) in PM2.5, followed by sulfate (15.1%) during 2004-2013, which was overtaken by nitrate (14.9%) after 2013. Each PM2.5 source demonstrated significant seasonal and annual variations due to changes in climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities.

ECs have been classified into various categories; however, this article focuses on the fate of major categories, namely pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), flame retardants, surfactants, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), and micro -plastics (MPs). These ECs when discharged to sewer and downstream wastewater treatment plants can undergo further transformations and either degrade, persist or convert into by-products which have the potential in some cases to be more hazardous. Because of potential dangerous impacts of the availability of these contaminants in the environment, information on the fate and behavior of these pollutants is highly important to develop new strategies, such as the regulation of chemicals imported into Australia and Australian consumer goods and environmental policies to mitigate them in a sustainable way. Moreover, advanced technologies are required for the detection and identification of novel contaminants emerging in the environment at ultra low levels. The application of chromatographic techniques coupled with mass spectroscopy has provided attractive breakthroughs to detect new emerging contaminants. However, it is crucially important to understand the sensitivity and robustness of these analytical techniques when dealing with complex matrices such as biosolids. In addition, most of the literature was focused on selected compounds or a family of compounds and the existing reviews have paid less attention to examine the formation of metabolites during the wastewater treatment process and their impacts on the ecosystem. This review presents an overview of the presence of different classes of ECs around the world, their quantification from different sources like wastewater (influents or effluents), sludge and biosolids. In addition, the transformation of ECs during the treatment process, the formation of intermediate products and their impacts on the environment are also critically discussed. Three major steps of ECs analysis include sample preparation, extraction and clean-up, and analysis; hence, different methods employed for extraction and clean-up, and analytical techniques for identification are thor-oughly discussed, their advantages and limitations are also highlighted. This comprehensive review article is believed to enhance the understanding of ECs in sewage sludge and would be useful to the readers of the relevant communities and various stakeholders to investigate potential technologies to maximize destruction of ECs.

Pleurotus ostreatus is a widely cultivated edible fungus that is prone to attack from fungivorous insects and mites. Yet P. ostreatus has evolved an elegant defense system against fun-givore attacks. In this study, we investigated how the oyster mushroom responds to the fungivory and me-chanical wounding by conducting transcriptome, proteome, and secondary metabolic analyses. The profiling analysis revealed a total of 11,495 transcripts and 866 proteins, 4416 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and 62 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in response to the mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae feeding and mechanical wounding. In comparing the responses induced by mechanical wounding, some genes, proteins, and metabolites were uniquely induced or repressed by the mite. At the transcript level, nine pathways were activated by the mite feeding, including those of ""MAPK signaling pathway-yeast"", ""Phenylalanine metabolism"", and ""Biotin metabolism"", among others, while both enrichment of ""Ribosome"", ""Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes"", and ""Regulation of Mitophagy in Yeast"" demonstrated the common effects upon fungal secretory protein synthesis and processing induced by fungivory and mechanical wounding. Fungivory also stimulated the synthesis of C8-aryl compounds and sesquiterpenes (especially1-octen-3-ol and alpha-/beta-bisabolene), and these compounds repellent to T. putrescentiae. Both jasmonic acid (JA) and jasmonic acid methyl ester (MeJA) were specifically regulated by mite feeding and mechanical wounding. The terpene synthase gene transcription was significantly increased induced by the exogenous addition of MeJA, resulting in defensive sesquiterpene production against the mite. These findings are the first to demonstrate that the reactive oxygen species (ROS)/MAPK signaling pathway, JA regulation, specific gene expression, and protein synthesis, and anti -mite substance metabolism are all involved in coordinated inducible chemical-based defense responses in P. ostreatus, which could be especially effective the mite T. putrescentiae.",,10.1016/j.foodres.2022.111708,Defense Mechanisms,NA,

In metabolome analysis, 9512 low-mass ions (LMIs) were identified-7 LMIs were abundant in all lumbar versus paired ventricular CSF samples, and 3 LMIs were significantly abundant in all ventricular CSF. In comparisons between spinal LM (+) CSF and LM (-) CSF, 105 LMIs were discriminative for spinal LM (+) CSF. In proteome analysis, a total of 1536 proteins were measured. A total of 18 proteins, including complement C3, were more highly expressed in all lumbar CSF, compared with paired ventricular CSF, while 82 proteins, including coagulation factor V, were higher in the ventricular CSF. Of 37 discriminative proteins, including uteroglobin and complement component C8 gamma chain, 4 were higher in all spinal LM (+) CSF versus spinal LM (-) CSF. We further evaluated metabolic pathways associated with these discriminative proteins using the Gene Ontology database. We found that 16/17 spinal LM (+) pathways, including complement activation, were associated with lumbar discriminative proteins, whereas only 2 pathways were associated with ventricular-discriminative proteins. In conclusion, we determined that metabolite and protein profiles differed between paired lumbar and ventricular CSF samples. The protein profiles of spinal LM (+) CSF showed more similarity with the lumbar CSF than the ventricular CSF. Thus, we suggest that CSF LMIs and proteins could reflect LM disease activity and that LM-associated differences in CSF are more likely to be present in the lumbar compartment.",,10.3390/metabo12010080,Proteomics;Proteome;Neoplasm Metastasis;Cerebrospinal Fluid,NA,

As a transformation pathway, the catalytic pyrolysis of lipids can remove oxygen atoms and modify molecular structures via carbon chain cracking and aromatisation. However, this pathway has not yet been certified for the production of alternative aviation fuels. Therefore, a detailed review of various heterogeneous catalysts for the conversion of lipids into hydrocarbon fuels with molecular weights and structures suitable for use in aviation is presented herein, with a focus on aspects such as their physical and chemical properties, pore distributions and structures, active sites, key functions, catalytic performance, and pyrolysis mechanisms. Metal oxides can effectively remove oxygen atoms, whereas zeolites can achieve long-carbon-chain cracking to yield desirable gasoline-, kerosene-, or diesel-range fuels. Moreover, zeolites typically permit aromatisation, which yields the aromatic hydrocarbons required for liquid fuels. Modification of the pore structures of zeolites to yield hierarchical pores can improve the production of C8-C16-range liquid fuels to maximise the bio-kerosene yield. Therefore, composite catalysts (metal oxides supported on zeolites with hierarchical pores) can be effective for molecular-level structural modification in the pyrolytic production of alternative aviation fuels using lipids. However, rapid deactivation due to coking, poisoning, and sintering hinder the operation of these catalysts. Coking, which is predominantly responsible for pyrolysis catalyst deactivation, should be targeted in future research on novel catalysts. The synthetic strategy of catalysts and the mitigation of their issues are critical to the design of novel catalytic pyrolysis systems for the efficient cracking of triglyceride-rich feedstock to yield alternative aviation fuels.",,10.1016/j.apcata.2022.118769,Aviation,NA,

Methods The present study identified among the 1400 papers 24 original and one review paper, which were suited to re-evaluate the efficacy of > 750,000 published NIPT-results. Special attention was given to false-positive and false-negative result-rates. Those were discussed under different aspects-mainly from a patient-perspective. Results A 27: 1 rate of false-positive compared to false-negative NIPT results was found. Besides, according to all reported, real-positive, chromosomally aberrant NIPT cases, 90% of those would have been aborted spontaneously before birth. These findings are here discussed under aspects like (i) How efficient is NIPT compared to first trimester screening? (ii) What are the differences in expectations towards NIPT from specialists and the public? and (iii) There should also be children born suffering from not by NIPT tested chromosomal aberrations; why are those never reported in all available NIPT studies? Conclusions Even though much research has been published on NIPT, unbiased figures concerning NIPT and first trimester screening efficacy are yet not available. While false positive rates of different NIPT tests maybe halfway accurate, reported false-negative rates are most likely too low. The latter is as NIPT-cases with negative results for tested conditions are yet not in detail followed up for cases with other genetic or teratogenic caused disorders. This promotes an image in public, that NIPT is suited to replace all invasive tests, and also to solve the problem of inborn errors in humans, if not now then in near future. Overall, it is worth discussing the usefulness of NIPT in practical clinical application. Particularly, asking for unbiased figures concerning the efficacy of first trimester-screening compared to NIPT, and for really comprehensive data on false-positive and false-negative NIPT results.",,10.1186/s13039-022-00612-2,Learning,NA,

The present systematic review study aimed to investigate the impact of environmental and occupational factors on reproductive parameters and increased risk of couple infertility. Main body: Scopus, PubMed, SID, and Web of Science databases were searched for the available observational (i.e., cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional) systematic review, meta-analysis, and clinical trial studies between 2007 and 2019. To this end, keywords such as 'Environmental exposure', 'Occupational exposure', 'Environmental pollutants', 'Environmental pollution', 'Couple infertility', 'Sterility', and 'Sub-fertility' were used. The retrieved investigations examined the impact of environmental and occupational risk factors on reproductive indices and increased infertility risk. Totally, 66 out of 9519 papers were evaluated after considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The reported risk factors in the reviewed studies were heavy metals, cigarette smoking, and exposure to chemicals through consumer goods, urban life, and proximity to main roads. In addition, occupational factors included heavy physical activity, prolonged sitting, exposure to a hot environment, contact with formaldehyde, pesticides, insecticides, mechanical vibration, and contact with ionizing radiation, all of which affected the reproductive parameters. However, some researchers found no significant associations in this regard. Short conclusion: In general, individuals with known impairments in reproductive parameters were more exposed to risk factors. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to determine the risk of infertility in the population.",,10.1186/s43043-022-00124-4,,NA,

These exposures often represent a complex mixture of different stressors, challenging the ability to delineate the mechanisms and risk factors underlying exposure-disease relationships. The use of omics measurement approaches that enable characterization of biological marker patterns provide internal indicators of molecular alterations, which could be used to identify bioeffects following exposure to a toxicant. Metabolomics is the comprehensive analysis of small molecule present in biological samples, and allows identification of potential modes of action and altered pathways by systematic measurement of metabolites. Objectives The aim of this study is to review the application of metabolomics studies for use in occupational health, with a focus on applying metabolomics for exposure monitoring and its relationship to occupational diseases. Methods PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus electronic databases were systematically searched for relevant studies published up to 2021. Results Most of reviewed studies included worker populations exposed to heavy metals such as As, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Mn and organic compounds such as tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, trichloroethylene, polyfluoroalkyl, acrylamide, polyvinyl chloride. Occupational exposures were associated with changes in metabolites and pathways, and provided novel insight into the relationship between exposure and disease outcomes. The reviewed studies demonstrate that metabolomics provides a powerful ability to identify metabolic phenotypes and bioeffect of occupational exposures. Conclusion Continued application to worker populations has the potential to enable characterization of thousands of chemical signals in biological samples, which could lead to discovery of new biomarkers of exposure for chemicals, identify possible toxicological mechanisms, and improved understanding of biological effects increasing disease risk associated with occupational exposure.",,10.1007/s11306-022-01930-7,,NA,

These agents include air, gas (sulfur hexafluoride [SF6], hexafluoroethane [C2F6], and perfluoropropane [C3F8]), and silicone oil. The optimal tamponade agent is uncertain, and we aimed to review the effect of tamponade choice on hole closure and visual outcomes. Clinical relevance: Although most surgeons initially chose to use long-acting gas (C3F8), there has been a gradual change in practice to the increasing use of the medium- (C2F6) and short-acting gases (SF6) or even air. However, there is no consensus regarding their relative efficacies. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective and retrospective comparative cohort studies comparing different tamponade agents in patients undergoing vitrectomy and ILM peeling for primary idiopathic macular holes. For RCTs, the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs, whereas for nonrandomized studies, the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool was used. Results: Thirteen publications, including 2 RCTs, were identified. Overall, there was no significant difference in the anatomic closure rates between studies using SF6 compared with either C3F8 or C2F6 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51-1.08). A subgroup analysis showed a significantly higher closure rate using SF6 (OR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.30-0.79) in patients without postoperative posturing but not in those who were advised to posture facedown. The visual outcomes and adverse events were not significantly different. The comparisons of anatomic closure rates of patients treated with gas tamponade vs. silicone oil and with air vs. SF6 showed no significant differences. The included studies had a number of methodological limitations and heterogeneities, making conclusions imprecise, with low or very low certainty by the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Conclusion: The current evidence base for tamponade selection with vitrectomy and ILM peeling for full-thickness macular hole has several major limitations. Further appropriately designed studies are needed to guide tamponade selection. (C) 2022 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.",,10.1016/j.oret.2022.01.023,Vitrectomy,NA,

The immunotoxicity of EDCs involves many mechanisms altering gene expression that depend on the activation of nuclear receptors such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the estrogen receptor (ER), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which also results in skin and intestinal disorders, microbiota alterations and inflammatory diseases. This systematic review aims to review different mechanisms of immunotoxicity and immunomodulation of T cells, focusing on T regulatory (Treg) and Th17 subsets, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) caused by specific EDCs such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), bisphenols (BPs) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). To achieve this objective, a systematic study was conducted searching various databases including PubMed and Scopus to find in-vitro, in-vivo, and biomonitoring studies that examine EDC-dependent mechanisms of immunotoxicity. While doing the systematic review, we found species- and cell-specific outcomes and a translational gap between in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. Finally, an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework is proposed, which explains mechanistically toxicity endpoints emerging from different EDCs having similar key events and can help to improve our understanding of EDCs mechanisms of immunotoxicity.

Fishes are the main group of organisms studied in aquatic toxicology, and their behaviours, including feeding, courtship, parental care, and territoriality, are essential to their health. Cichlids are one of the most abundant fish families and are both economically and ecologically relevant. In this review, we found that metals, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and endocrine disruptor chemicals are the main groups of pollutants that have been studied in the context of cichlid behaviour. African tilapias are the most evaluated cichlids on this topic, and Nile tilapia was the most frequently studied species. Exposure to these pollutants has been shown to affect cichlid fish behaviours in aspects including erratic swimming, activity versus inactivity, preference for the bottom and/or the surface of the tank, aggressiveness, feeding, predation, and reproduction. Oxidative stress, failures in neurotransmission, energetic imbalances, and histopathological damage are among the most common mechanisms underlying the behavioural changes. It is necessary to establish a set of integrative criteria for evaluating the ecotoxicological behaviour of cichlid fish, given the current lack of standardised methods.

The project aims to provide urban planners with information on the remediation of vacant lands using urban runoff pollutant removal techniques. To find the most effective removal method, relevant scholarly papers and case studies are reviewed to see what types of vacant land have many urban runoff pollutants and how to effectively remove contaminants from stormwater runoff in the city by SCMs. The results show that previously developed/used land (but now vacant) has been identified as contaminated sites, including prior residential, commercial, industrial, and parking lot land use from urban areas. SCMs are effective management approaches to reduce nonpoint source pollution problems runoff. It is an umbrella concept that can be used to capture nature-based, cost-effective, and eco-friendly treatment technologies and redevelopment strategies that are socially inclusive, economically viable, and with good public acceptance. Among these removal techniques, a bioretention system tends to be effective for removing dissolved and particulate components of heavy metals and phosphorus. Using different plant species and increasing filter media depth has identified the effectiveness of eliminating nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N). A medium with a high hydraulic conductivity covers an existing medium with low hydraulic conductivity, and the result will be a higher and more effective decrease for phosphorus (P) pollutants. In addition, wet ponds were found to be highly effective at removing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, with removal rates as high as 99%. For the removal of perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) pollutants, despite the implementation of SCMs in urban areas to remove PFAAs and particulate-related contaminants in stormwater runoff, the current literature has little information on SCMs' removal of PFAAs. Studies have also found that VUL's size, shape, and connectivity are significantly inversely correlated with the reduction in stormwater runoff.

A comprehensive review about ECs including the occurrence and ecotoxicity, as well as the controlling strategies was made. Firstly, the idea of ECs ''block'' was introduced to connect different ECs during the supply of feed and food chain. The existence of ECs in different contaminant blocks would eventually affect human health.

Sulfide, serves as both reductant and nucleophile, can form intermediates with the catalyst surface functional group through chemical interaction, efficiently promoting the catalytic reduction process to remove contaminants. Sulfite assisted catalytic process could be classified to the advanced reduction processes (ARPs) and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), mainly depending on the presence of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the solution. During ARPs, sulfite could generate reductive active species including hydrated electron (e(aq)(-)), hydrogen radical (Hmiddot), and sulfite radical (SO3 center dot-) under the irradiation of UV light, leading to the efficient reduction removal of a variety of contaminants. During AOPs, sulfite could first produce SO3 center dot- under the action of the catalyst or energy, initiating a series of reactions to produce oxysulfur radicals.

In VRFB, polymer membranes play a significant role in transporting protons for current transmission and act as barriers between positive and negative electrodes/electrolytes. Commercial polymer membranes (such as Nafion) are the widely used IEM in VRFBs due to their outstanding chemical stability and proton conductivity. However, the membrane cost and increased vanadium ions permeability limit its commercial application. Therefore, various modified perfluorinated and non-perfluorinated membranes have been developed. This comprehensive review primarily focuses on recent developments of hybrid polymer composite membranes with inorganic TiO2 nanofillers for VRFB applications. Hence, various fabrications are performed in the membrane with TiO2 to alter their physicochemical properties for attaining perfect IEM. Additionally, embedding the -SO3H groups by sulfonation on the nanofiller surface enhances membrane proton conductivity and mechanical strength. Incorporating TiO2 and modified TiO2 (sTiO(2), and organic silica modified TiO2) into Nafion and other non-perfluorinated membranes (sPEEK and sPI) has effectively influenced the polymer membrane properties for better VRFB performances. This review provides an overall spotlight on the impact of TiO2-based nanofillers in polymer matrix for VRFB applications.",,10.3390/polym14081617,Oxidation-Reduction;Polymerization;Polymers;Vanadium,NA,

Increasing temperatures, sea ice retreat, slumping permafrost, changing sea ice regimes, glacial loss and changes in precipitation patterns can all affect how contaminants distribute within the Arctic environment and subsequently impact the Arctic ecosystems.

We have also drawn on parallel examples observed in Antarctica and the Tibetan Plateau, to broaden the discussion on how climate change may influence contaminant fate in similar cold-climate ecosystems. Significant knowledge gaps on indirect effects of climate change on contaminants in the Arctic environment, including those of extreme weather events, increase in forests fires, and enhanced human activities leading to new local contaminant emissions, have been identified. Enhanced mobilization of contaminants to marine and freshwater ecosystems has been observed as a result of climate change, but better linkages need to be made between these observed effects with subsequent exposure and accumulation of contaminants in biota.

Faced with the potentially harmful effects of ECs on humans, regulatory agencies around the world require the integration of epidemiological, in vivo toxicological, and in vitro mechanistic data to provide the necessary information for hazard classification, labeling, and risk management of chemicals. However, animal studies have time-consuming and high-cost defects and ethical problems. High-throughput in vitro assays are also unable to provide systematic toxicological information for chemical hazard classification for over 100000 chemicals in commerce.        Recently, computing resources and artificial intelligence have innovatively improved the accuracy and speed of machine learning (ML) algorithms, and the structural biology and deep learning (DL) algorithms (e.g., AlphaFold2 and AF2Complex) have incrementally resolved a large number of biomolecular crystal structures. Thus, the use of computational toxicology techniques in environmental toxicology has increased significantly. It is estimated that computational toxicology techniques can perform virtual screening of millions of compounds in a limited amount of time for the contaminant-biomolecule interaction process. Thus, computational toxicology techniques can reduce the initial experimental cost of identifying environmental emerging contaminants, increase information on the toxicity mechanisms of ECs, and improve the efficiency of hazard identification of ECs by regulatory authorities.        This study systematically reviews computational toxicology techniques commonly used to analyze ECs-biomolecule interactions, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and machine learning-based modelling. Molecular docking is a well-established molecular simulation method that explores the interactions between biomolecules and small molecules to predict their binding modes and binding affinities. MD can simulate the flexible binding process of contaminant-biomolecule and the dynamic conformational shift process of contaminant-biomolecule complexes, providing more comprehensive information on the interaction mechanism. Machine learning-based modelling is a novel computational toxicology technique that is completely different from molecular simulation. It mainly uses publicly available structural information and in chemico, in vitro, and in vivo bioactivity data to construct (quantitative) structure-activity relationships (Q)SARs based on ML algorithms, and uses (Q)SAR models to rapidly improve the efficiency of virtual screening of ECs targeted at biomolecules, and further deepen the analysis of contaminant-biomolecule interaction mechanisms in complex biological contexts. In this paper, the main applications of these techniques in the field of environmental toxicology in recent years are systematically reviewed, including the mechanistic studies of contaminant-biomolecule interactions and high-throughput virtual screening. The advantages and limitations of these techniques in terms of ligand-receptor interaction, explainability, training efficiency, computational depth, and biological processes are discussed. Results showed that MD simulations, which can deeply explore contaminant-biomolecule interactions, are unable to achieve the high-throughput virtual screening of ECs. Machine learning-based modelling, which can reflect the complex biological processes and achieve high accuracy prediction, unable to effectively interpret the prediction results due to the 'black box' defects. Molecular docking, which has the potential to be a high throughput virtual screening method, is limited by local sampling and approximate scoring function deficiencies. These problems limit the ability of molecular docking to analyze more comprehensive mechanisms of ECs-biomolecule interactions. Therefore, only the combination of multiple computational toxicology techniques to develop an integrated workflow for mechanistic analysis and virtual screening can compensate for their respective shortcomings and obtain optimal results. However, how to increase the computational throughput screening while maintaining the mechanism analysis remains a key issue to be addressed in the future.",,10.1360/TB-2022-0613,,NA,

Many causes of AMI exist, which usually begin with mucosal injury. Onset is insiduous and there is frequent diagnostic delay. Current treatments can only control established injury and prevent propagation, hence new interventions are needed. The prevention and treatment of AMI by intraluminal delivery of oxygen has yet to be investigated in the clinical setting. This article aims to systemically review experimental studies investigating this novel therapy. MethodsFollowing the PRISMA guidelines, searches of PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases were performed up to June 2022. Two independent investigators extracted the data. ResultsThere were 20 experimental studies, 16 of which used an occlusive ischaemia reperfusion model. Six different formulations were used to deliver intraluminal oxygen, with perflurocarbon being the most common. Studies consistently showed local and systemic benefits. Intraluminal oxygen therapy improved histological severity of mucosal injury in all studies when oxygen was delivered during the ischaemia phase, but could cause harm if given during the reperfusion phase. Improvement was also demonstrated in endpoints assessing intestinal function, biomarkers of intestinal damage, measures of systemic physiological derangement and mortality.

Moreover, it is difficult to assess the full impact of human exposure to EDCs because adverse effects develop latently and manifest at different ages, even if preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that developing fetus and neonates are most vulnerable to endocrine disruption.Conclusion EDCs represent a major environmental and health issue that has a role in cancer development. There are currently some EDCs that can be considered as carcinogenic, like dioxin and cadmium for breast and thyroid cancer; arsenic, asbestos, and dioxin for prostate cancer; and organochlorines/organohalogens for testicular cancer.

As an emerging oxidant in the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), periodate (PI) has received worldwide attention owing to the advantages of superior stability, susceptible acti-vation capability, and high efficiency for decontamination. This is the first review that conducts a comprehensive analysis of the mechanism, pollutant transformation pathway, toxicity evolution, barriers, and future directions of PI-based AOPs based on the scientific information and experimental data reported in recent years. The pollutant elimination in PI-based AOPs was mainly attributed to the in situ generate reactive oxygen species (e.g., & BULL;OH, O(3P), 1O2, and O2 & BULL;-), reactive iodine species (e.g., IO3 & BULL; and IO4 & BULL;), and high-valent metal-oxo species with exceptionally high reactivity. These reactive species were derived from the PI activated by the external energy, metal activators, alkaline, freezing, hydroxylamine, H2O2, etc. It is noteworthy that direct electron transport could also dominate the decontamination in carbon-based catalyst/PI systems. Furthermore, PI was transformed to iodate (IO3?) stoichiometrically via an oxygen-atom transfer process in most PI-based AOPs systems. However, the production of I2, I-, and HOI was sometimes inevitable. Furthermore, the transformation pathway of typical micropollutants was clarified, and the in silico QSAR-based prediction results indicated that most transformation products retained biodegradation recalcitrance and multi-endpoint toxicity. The barriers faced by the PI-based AOPs were also clarified with potential solutions. Finally, future perspectives and research directions are highlighted based on the current state of PI-based AOPs.

The resultant GAP-FP copolymers represent a unique hybrid binder system with tunable energy releasing and oxidizing potentials intended for metallized formulations. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the carbonaceous residue usually formed from the decomposition of GAP could be reduced significantly by the copolymerization with FP. Isoconversional method of kinetic analysis of the GAP-FP co-polymers revealed an increasing dependence of the effective activation energy on the extent of conversion.

Environmental pollutants classified as EDCs and affecting the central nervous system include perfluoroalcanes, parabens, phthalates, organotins, bisphenols, benzophenones, polychlorinated biphenyls, and dioxins. In this review we provide a brief description of these families of EDCs. We report and compare the EDC concentrations measured in the brain of humans and wild animals naturally exposed to these molecules, as well as in the brain of laboratory animals experimentally exposed to EDCs. The importance of using sophisticated analytical tools to detect EDCs in the brain is pointed out. The ability of blood-brain interfaces to reduce the brain exposition to EDCs in adult and during development is discussed in relation with the specific morphological, transport and metabolic properties of these cellular layers. Finally, we review the evidence that the neuroprotective functions of blood-brain interfaces can be altered by EDCs, a process that may participate to the central toxic action of these molecules. Overall this analysis points to the implication of blood-brain interfaces in setting the extent of central EDCs toxicity, although most evidence is indirect.

Recently, the vital role of PFSA ionomer in the local transfer of proton, oxygen, and water in fuel cell catalyst layer has been recognized, thus its properties have attracted more attention. In this review, a comprehensive comparison between PFSA bulk membrane and ultrathin PFSA ionomer film is summarized as morphology, physical properties (e.g., water uptake, surface wettability, diffusivity), and mechanical properties (e.g., crystallization, antiplasticization, glass transition point).

Specifically, research on the measurement of the thermodynamic parameters, toxicity, corrosion, environmental compatibility and dispersion characteristics are summarized, revealing that the poor dispersibility, corrosion of the hydrolysates (perfluoropropionic acid), corrosion and toxicity of thermal breakdown products such as HF and COF2 and environmentally unfriendly products such as perfluorocarbons should be paid more attention. Three main synthesis routes of C6F12O are also introduced in view of its promising prospects for application. Furthermore, the fire extinguishing efficiency of C6F12O has been fully investigated in both a laboratory burner scale and full-scale fire extinguishing experiment, the results of which show that the minimum extinguishing volume concentration of C6F12O is lower than HFCs, but the mass concentration is much higher. Although C6F12O has shown satisfactory fire extinguishing performance in various fire protection scenarios, fire enhancement phenomenon and the large production of HF have been observed during fire extinguishment.

For applications on foldable smartphones these coatings should have simultaneously wear resistance and flexibility. These properties are normally mutually exclusive. These properties were achieved recently via the photoinduced cationic ring-opening polymerization of 3-glycidyloxypropyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (GPOSS) grafted with the anti-smudge agent poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS). While this was the first example of a hard and flexible anti-smudge coating, improvements to hardness/wear resistance, flexibility and surface energy were desirable. Herein, efforts to improve POSS-based omniphobic coatings are described. The first study involves the use of perfluoroalkyl groups in GPOSS to lower the coating’s surface energy. A systematic study is conducted by comparing the hardness, flexibility, and de-wetting properties of GPOSS coatings containing either -CF2CF3 or -CF2(CF2)4CF3 at various concentrations as the anti-smudge agent. Coatings containing the -CF2(CF2)4CF3 moiety are more effective at reducing the surface energy without significantly reducing the hardness. This coating can also withstand tens of bending cycles while maintaining its anti-smudge properties. In search of POSS coatings with a higher hardness and wear resistance, POSS consisting of two different polymerizable groups, specifically methacrylate (M) and glycidyl (G) groups, are prepared to give various GmMnPOSS compounds.

This perfluoro effect was identified as the driving force in modulating the dynamics of the S1 (ππ*) state of pentafluorobenzene in the past. Vibronic coupling between the excited ππ* and higher-lying πσ* states, mediated by out-ofplane vibrational modes, yields oscillations of the time-resolved response signals. In this Thesis, the influence of the effects of number, position, and nature of substituent as well as the influence of a heteroatom in the aromatic system on the dynamics of the S1 state were systematically investigated by means of femtosecond time-resolved time-of-flight mass spectrometry and corresponding photoelectron imaging spectroscopy, supported by ab initio calculations. The set of molecules included 1,2,3-TriFB, all three TFB isomers, PFT, PFPh as well as ClPFB and BrPFB, and PFPy. Nearly all time-resolved parent ion yields showed intense oscillations. The photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed vibronic coupling to be the origin of the oscillations. The oscillations became more pronounced the more fluorine atoms were attached to the aromatic rings and the closer they were to each other. In contrast, different substituents damped the oscillations. A complex multi-mode oscillation was observed for 1,2,3,5-TFB, exhibiting two oscillational frequencies. Thus, the dynamics of 1,2,4,5-TFB (no oscillation), 1,2,3,5-TFB (multi-frequency oscillation), and 1,2,3,4-TFB (single-frequency oscillation) are strikingly different, despite nearly identical electronic structures. PFPy showed an even more intricate signal pattern. At least three oscillational frequencies could be attributed to genuine vibrational modes. Hence, the dynamics of PFPy demonstrates that one can map the motion of multiple vibrational modes of the coupled wavepacket at once in real time.",,,Abschlussarbeit;PhD thesis;doctoral thesis;ddc:500;femtosecond spectroscopy;mass spectrometry;photoelectron imaging spectroscopy;excited electronic states;vibronic coupling;pentafluorobenzene;tetrafluorobenzene;pentafluoropyridine;pentafluorotoluene;pentafluorophenol;Femtosekunden-Spektroskopie;Massenspektrometrie;Photoelektronen-Imaging Spektroskopie;elektronisch angeregte Zustände;vibronische Kopplung;Pentafluorbenzol;Tetrafluorbenzol;Pentafluorpyridin;Pentafluorphenol;Ultrafast,NA,

However, these roles have not been well quantified, and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We combine experiments with theory to study systematically the curvature-dependence of cell migration inside PDMS microcylinders. We find that persistence is positively correlated with speed, following the universal speed-persistence coupling relation, i.e., faster cells turn less. Cell migration inside microcylinders is anisotropic and depends on curvature in a biphasic manner. At small curvatures, as curvature increases, the average speed and anisotropy both increase, but surprisingly, the average persistence decreases. Whereas as the curvature increases over some threshold, cells detach from the surface, the average speed and anisotropy both decrease sharply but the average persistence increases. Moreover, interestingly, cells are found to leave paxillins along their trajectories (on curved but not planar surfaces), facilitating the assembly of focal adhesions of following cells. We propose a minimal model for the biphasic curvotaxis based on three mechanisms: the persistent random “noise”, the bending penalty of stress fibers, and the cell-surface adhesion.

Due to their sub-micron size, high particle density, and highly deformable shell, NBs exhibit unique properties. In pathological states of heightened vascular permeability, such as in tumours, NBs can extravasate, enabling extravascular applications not currently possible with clinically available microbubbles (∼1000-10,000 nm diameter). This ability can be explored to develop imaging biomarkers to improve tumour detection. There is a need for an imaging method that can rapidly and effectively separate intravascular versus extravascular NB signal when imaged using nonlinear dynamic contrast enhanced US. Herein, we demonstrated the use of decorrelation time (DT) mapping to achieve this goal. Two in vitro models were used to explore the roles of NB velocity and diffusion on DTs. Mice bearing prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expressing flank tumours (n = 7) were injected with bubble agents to evaluate the in vivo potential of this technique. The DT was calculated at each pixel of nonlinear contrast videos to produce DT maps. Across all models, long DT correlated with slowly moving or entrapped NBs while short DT correlated with flowing NBs. DT maps were sensitive to NBs in tumour tissue with high average DT in tumour regions (∼10 s) compared to surrounding normal tissue (∼1 s). Molecular NB targeting to PSMA extended DT (17 s) compared to non-targeted NBs (12 s), demonstrating sensitivity to NB adherence dynamics. Overall, DT mapping of in vivo NB dynamics produced detailed information of tumour tissue and showed potential for quantifying extravascular NB kinetics. This new NB-contrast enhanced US-based biomarker can be useful in molecular ultrasound imaging, with improved sensitivity and specificity of target tissue detection and potential for use as a predictor of vascular permeability and the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in tumours.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.12.21.521428,,NA,

The heme synthesis pathway converts 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), a fluorogenic substrate used for FGS, to fluorescent protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). The resulting fluorescence is thought to be specific to transformed glioma cells, but this specificity has not been examined at single-cell level. We performed paired single-cell imaging and RNA sequencing of individual cells (SCOPE-seq2) on human GBM surgical specimens with visible PpIX fluorescence from patients who received 5-ALA prior to surgery. SCOPE-seq2 allows us to simultaneously image PpIX fluorescence and unambiguously identify transformed glioma cells from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). We observed that 5-ALA treatment results in labeling that is not specific to transformed tumor cells. In cell culture, we further demonstrated that untransformed cells can be labeled by 5-ALA directly or by PpIX secreted from surrounding transformed cells. In acute slice cultures from mouse glioma models, we showed that 5-ALA preferentially labels GBM tumor tissue over non-neoplastic brain tissue, and that this contrast is not due to blood-brain-barrier disruption. Taken together, our findings support the use of 5-ALA as an indicator of GBM tissue, but not as a specific marker of transformed glioma cells.Competing Interest StatementColumbia University has filed patent applications on the SCOPE-seq technology used in these studies.

Biomaterial scaffolds with macroscale porosity have demonstrated tremendous promise in regenerative medicine where they have been shown to allow immune cell infiltration and subsequent activation, but whether these types of materials can serve as an immunization platform is unknown. We developed an injectable immunization platform that uses a slurry of antigen-loaded hydrogel microparticles that anneal to form a porous scaffold with high surface area for antigen uptake by infiltrating immune cells as the biomaterial degrades to maximize humoral immunity. Antigen-loaded-microgels elicited a robust cellular humoral immune response, with increased CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and prolonged germinal center (GC) B cells comparable to the commonly used adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide (Alum). By simply increasing the weight fraction of polymer material, we enhanced material stiffness and further increased antigen-specific antibody titers superior to Alum. Vaccinating mice with inactivated influenza virus loaded into this more highly crosslinked formulation elicited a strong antibody response and provided better protection against a high dose viral challenge than Alum. Thus, we demonstrate that by tuning physical and chemical properties alone, we can enhance adjuvanticity and promote humoral immunity and protection against a pathogen, leveraging two different types of antigenic material: individual protein antigen and inactivated virus.

We identify bacterial taxa present in the gut spanning multiple phyla, including Bacillota (Firmicutes), Fusobacteriota and Pseudomonadota (Proteobacteria), that use uric acid and adenine– a key precursor of nucleic acids in intestinal cells, as carbon and energy sources anaerobically, and uncover a gene cluster encoding key steps of purine degradation that is widely distributed among gut dwelling bacteria. Furthermore, we demonstrate that colonization of germ-free mice with purine-degrading bacteria modulates levels of uric acid and other purines in the gut and systemically. Altogether this work demonstrates that gut microbes are important drivers of host global purine homeostasis and uric acid levels, and suggests that gut bacterial catabolism of purines may represent a novel mechanism by which the gut microbiome influences host health.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.12.12.520169,Bacteria;Uric Acid,NA,

To address this unmet need we aimed to generate inducible NHP models of photoreceptor degeneration. We generated three cynomolgus macaque models using distinct strategies. We used two genetically targeted strategies using optogenetics and Crispr-Cas9 to ablate specifically rods to mimic rod-cone dystrophy. Additionally, we created an acute model by physical separation of the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium using a polymer patch. Retinal degeneration was evaluated in all three models by in-life exams such as fundus imaging, optical coherence tomography, adaptive optics and electroretinography. In the genetic models we observed punctuate areas of degeneration in the injected area marked by disorganization of outer segments, loss of rod photoreceptors and thinning of the outer nuclear layer. In the acute model, the degeneration was faster and involved both rods and cones. Among the three distinct NHP models, the Crispr-Cas9 based approach was the most advantageous model in view of recapitulating disease specific features and its ease of implementation.

The underlying pathomechanisms are complex and involve immune cell infiltration and degradation of the vascular extracellular matrix (ECM). Hyaluronan (HA), synthesized at the plasma membrane by three HA synthase isoenzymes (HAS1-3), is not only a major constituent of the ECM but also known to directly affect the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells as well as immunological responses. Specifically, the HAS3 isoenzyme has been reported to play a major role in various inflammatory conditions. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of HAS3-derived HA in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm. To this end, we used a murine model of Angiotensin II (AngII)-induced abdominal aortic aneurysms and dissections (AAAs/AADs) and could demonstrate that genetic depletion of Has3 improves survival in Apoe/Has3 double deficient (Apoe/Has3-DKO) mice via the reduced occurrence of aortic ruptures. Mechanistically, fewer elastica breaks were observed in Apoe/Has3-DKO mice compared to Apoe-KO littermates. This was associated with a decreased infiltration of myeloid immune cells into the vessel wall of Has3-deficient mice while in parallel elevated numbers of circulating leukocytes were detected. RNA seq analysis from aortic tissue pointed towards a disturbed endothelial-myeloid cell communication as a cause for the diminished recruitment of immune cells to the aortic wall. While endothelial cells were unaffected, upregulation of adhesion receptors as well as the HA receptor CD44, known to mediate leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium, was blunted in monocytes from Apoe/Has3-DKO mice in response to AngII treatment. These findings underline the pivotal detrimental role of monocyte’s HAS3-dependent pericellular HA matrix for an exaggerated immune cell recruitment to inflammatory foci giving here rise for an increased incidence of ruptured aortic aneurysms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.12.01.518480,"Monocytes;Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal;Aortic Aneurysm",NA,

Antibodies are widely used to specifically bind cells and molecules to a solid support such as a column or suspended bead to separate, wash, and concentrate them.

Herein we describe a buoyant-antigen-magnetic (BAM) separation approach to increase specificity using two distinct separation processes with “AND” logic. Buoyant silica microbubbles and magnetic microbeads, each with their own antibody, bind to the target cell forming a BAM sandwich complex which can be separated from non-targeted cells (which are neither magnetic nor buoyant), as well as from cells bound to only single buoyant or magnetic microparticles but not both. Escherichia coli O157:H7, a pathogenic bacteria that can contaminate food products, was used as a model organism to establish a nearly 100-fold reduction in the non-specific carryover of non-target Escherichia coli bacteria in comparison to simple magnetic separation. Beads with no attached analyte were also removed. Furthermore, the BAM complexes could be visualized by eye (or camera) providing a rapid and sensitive method for pathogenic bacterial detection. Bacterial concentrations as low as 5 × 104 CFU/ml were evident by eye and could easily be distinguished from non-target S. aureus bacteria even at much higher concentrations (5x107 cfu/mL).

Here, we investigated the effects of ELS across three generations, by analyzing the responses of adult animals exposed to ELS in two different anxiety-related tasks, as well as in social behavior, memory, and cognition. Animals exposed to ELS (at 7 days-post-fertilization) showed a marked attenuation of specific anxiety-related behaviors (F0) when adults, and these alterations were maintained across two subsequent generations (F1 and F2). These findings suggest that zebrafish may be a useful model organism to study the transgenerational effects of ELS, and how this pertains to (for example) neuropsychiatric disorders.

Liver transplant rejection is among the most lethal complications of transplantation, and therapeutic development is limited by our lack of a comprehensive understanding of the cellular landscape of the liver. The laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus), ideal in size as a model for surgical procedures, is a strong platform to study liver biology in the context of liver transplantation. Liver allograft rejection is known to be strain-specific in the rat model, although the transplantation is accepted without rejection in some strains, it leads to acute rejection in others. To shed light on the cellular landscape of the rat liver and build a foundation for strain comparison, we present a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomics map of the healthy rat liver of Lewis and Dark Agouti strains. Using a novel computational pipeline we developed to guide the detailed annotation of our rat liver atlas, we discovered that hepatic myeloid cells have strong Lewis and Dark Agouti strain-specific differences focused on inflammatory signaling pathways. We experimentally validated these strain-specific differences in myeloid inflammatory potential in vitro using intracellular cytokine staining. Our work provides the first examination of the multi-strain healthy rat liver by single cell transcriptomics and uncovers key insights into strain-specific differences in this valuable model animal.Summary The laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) is a standard model animal for orthotopic liver transplantation. Transplanting a liver from a Dark agouti (DA) to a Lewis (LEW) strain rat leads to transplant rejection and the reverse procedure leads to tolerance. Understanding this strain difference may help explain the cellular drivers of liver allograft rejection post-transplant. This study uses single-cell transcriptomics to better understand the complex cellular composition of the rat liver and unravels cellular and molecular sources of inter-strain hepatic variation. We generated single-cell transcriptomic maps of the livers of healthy DA and LEW rat strains and developed a novel, factor analysis-based bioinformatics pipeline to study data covariates, such as strain and batch. Using this approach, we discovered variations within hepatocyte and myeloid populations that explain how the states of these cells differ between strains in the healthy rat, which may explain why these strains respond differently to liver transplants.Competing Interest StatementGDB is an advisor for Deep Genomics and is on the Scientific Advisory Board of Adela Bio.

Therapeutic hypothermia could be adjuvant therapy that optimizes the beneficial effect of reperfusion. While conventional whole-body cooling has severe adverse effects, selective brain cooling has emerged as an attractive alternative. However, clinical application is limited by the lack of optimal delivery methods and unknown treatment parameters. Optimal parameters may depend on injury levels and monitoring cerebral perfusion may provide valuable information. Here, we show that selective brain cooling via our in-house developed Vortex tube IntraNasal Cooling Instrument (VINCI), even with a clinically relevant delay in treatment, can attenuate subacute injuries in animals with severe ischemic stroke. The treatment responses of selective brain cooling were characterized by CT Perfusion (CTP). The predicted lesion volume by CTP matched the true infarct volume by histology when the brain temperature was decreased by 5°C from normothermia. More importantly, we found that global hyperemia (high cerebral blood flow) before rewarming could be an early manifestation of poor treatment outcomes. Altogether, our study shows that VINCI-enabled brain cooling could be guided by CTP imaging as adjuvant therapy for severe ischemic stroke. This work lays the groundwork toward individualized selective brain cooling.Significance Statement Not all patients suffering from ischemic stroke are eligible or fully recovered after recanalization therapies.

There is mounting evidence linking exposure to MDCs to increased susceptibility to diabetes. Despite the important role of glucagon in glucose homeostasis, there is little information on the effects of MDCs on α-cells. Furthermore, there are no methods to identify and test MDCs with the potential to alter α-cell viability and function. Here we used the mouse α-cell line αTC1-9 to evaluate the effects of MDCs on cell viability and glucagon secretion. We tested six chemicals at concentrations within human exposure (from 0.1 pM to 1 μM): bisphenol-A (BPA), tributyltin (TBT), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), triphenylphosphate (TPP), triclosan (TCS), and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE). Using two different approaches, MTT assay and DNA-binding dyes, we observed that BPA and TBT decreased α-cell viability via a mechanism that depends on the activation of estrogen receptors and PPARγ, respectively. These two chemicals induced ROS production, but barely altered the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers. Although PFOA, TPP, TCS, and DDE did not alter cell viability nor induced ROS generation or ER stress, all four compounds negatively affected glucagon secretion. Our findings suggest that αTC1-9 cells seem an appropriate model to test chemicals with metabolism-disrupting activity and that the improvement of the test methods proposed herein could be incorporated into protocols for the screening of diabetogenic MDCs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.11.07.515443,Mass Screening,NA,

This mutualist is cultivated by these ants in structures called fungus gardens. Ants exhibit weeding behaviors that keep their garden healthy by physically removing compromised pieces. However, how ants detect diseases of their fungus gardens is unknown. Here, we applied the logic of Koch’s postulates using environmental fungal community genomic sequencing, fungal isolation, and in vitro infection experiments to establish Trichoderma spp. as pathogens of Trachymyrmex septentrionalis fungus gardens. Our environmental data showed that Trichoderma are the most abundant non-cultivar fungi in wild T. septentrionalis fungus gardens. We further determined that metabolites produced by Trichoderma induce an ant weeding response that mirrors their response to live Trichoderma. Combining ant behavioral experiments with bioactivity-guided fractionation and statistical prioritization of metabolites in Trichoderma extracts demonstrated that T. septentrionalis ants weed in response to peptaibols, a specific class of secondary metabolites known to be produced by Trichoderma fungi. Similar assays conducted using purified peptaibols, including the two new peptaibols trichokindins VIII and IX, suggested that weeding is likely induced by peptaibols as a class rather than by a single peptaibol metabolite. In addition to their presence in laboratory experiments, we detected peptaibols in wild fungus gardens. Our combination of environmental data and in vitro experiments strongly support that peptaibols act as chemical cues of Trichoderma pathogenesis in T. septentrionalis fungus gardens.Significance Statement An extended defense response may exist in any relationship where one partner benefits from defending a mutualistic partner. Such a response is observed in the fungus-growing ant symbiosis, where ants must identify and remove pathogens of their symbiotic fungus gardens. Here we describe the fungal pathogen Trichoderma and its associated metabolites, which induce Trachymyrmex septentrionalis ant weeding behavior. Ants removed fungus garden pieces inoculated with Trichoderma spores or peptaibol-rich Trichoderma extracts, and peptaibols as a class cued ant defensive behavior, allowing T. septentrionalis to differentiate healthy from diseased fungus gardens. Extended defense responses mediated by chemical cues may be underappreciated mechanisms that structure symbiotic interactions.Competing Interest StatementK.E.K., S.P.P., A.M.C.R., J.R.-C., R.M.S., C.E.E., M.E., M.E.A., J.L.K, and M.J.B declare no competing interest.

MDCs are present in many consumer products, including food packaging, personal care products, plastic bottles and containers, and detergents. The scientific literature has ever-increasingly focused on insulin-releasing pancreatic β-cells as one of the main targets for MDCs. Evidence highlights that these substances may disrupt glucose homeostasis, altering pancreatic β-cell physiology. However, their potential impact on glucagon-secreting pancreatic α-cells remains poorly known despite the essential role that this cellular type plays in controlling glucose metabolism. In the present study, we have selected seven paradigmatic EDCs representing major toxic classes, including bisphenols, phthalates, perfluorinated compounds, metals, and pesticides.

Herein, we describe the development of PCM in a murine model of inducible bcr/abl oncogene-driven chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in which metaplasia is causally and temporally linked to the development of leukemia. Mechanistically, CML induced a proinflammatory state within the GI tract that resulted in the production of epithelial-derived IL-33. Binding of IL-33 to ST2 led to the production of IL-9 by type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) which was directly responsible for the induction of PCM in the colon and Paneth cell hyperplasia in the ileum. In addition, IL-9 directed remodeling of the small intestines characterized by goblet and tuft cell hyperplasia along with the expansion of mucosal mast cells. Thus, we identify that an extra intestinal disease can trigger an ILC2/IL-9 immune circuit which induces PCM and regulates epithelial cell fate decisions in the GI tract.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.11.02.514603,,NA,

Simultaneously, metals and metal isotopes have become promising tools for the geolocation of migratory insects. Furthering our understanding of metal cycling in insect tissues is essential, both for the development of metals and metal isotopes as geolocation tools, and for assessing the toxicity risks of metals to insects. We conducted a diet-switching experiment on monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) with controlled larval and adult diets to evaluate the dietary and environmental sources of 23 metals and metalloids, strontium isotopes, and lead isotopes to insect wing tissues over a period of 8 weeks. Concentrations of Ca, Co, and Sb differed between the sexes. Ni and Zn bioaccumulated in the insect wing tissues over time, likely from the adult diet, while increases in Al, Cr, Cd, Cu, Fe, and Pb were likely from external sources (i.e., dust aerosols). Bioaccumulation of Pb in the monarch wings was confirmed by Pb isotopes to be from external anthropogenic sources, revealing the potential of Pb isotopes to become an indicator and tracer of metal pollution exposure along migratory paths. Concentrations of Ba, Cs, Mg, Na, Rb, Sr, Ti, Tl, and U appeared to be unaffected by dietary or environmental contamination and should be further developed for geolocation purposes. Strontium isotope ratios remained indicative of the larval diet, at least in males, supporting its potential as a geolocation tool. However, the difference in strontium isotope ratios between sexes, as well as the possibility of external contamination by wetting, requires further investigation. Our results demonstrate the complexity of metal cycling in insects and the need for further investigations, as well as the value of studying metals to develop new tools to quantify pollution exposure, metal toxicity and insect mobility.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.11.02.514901,,NA,

Given these constraints, models predict that long range regulatory systems must exist to maintain flat forms. Juxtaposed microRNA (miR-NA) networks could serve as one of these regulatory systems. One of these miRNAs, miR319 is thought to be expressed from the base of leaves and to promote growth by degrading class II TCP transcription factor mRNAs. A miR319 overexpression mutant, jagged and wavy (jaw-D) exhibits rippling and undulating leaves, consistent with biomechanical predictions that without genetic spatial coordination, tissues will deform. It has been theorized that jaw-D rippling results from overgrowth at the margins, however this does not fully address how miR319 expression from the base of wild-type (WT) leaves allows them to flatten. Here, we track the growth, cell division and cell maturation in live WT and jaw-D leaves to ask how miR319 expression in WT promotes flattening. This data revealed the importance of spatially distinct growth, division and differentiation patterns in WT leaves, which are missing in jaw-D.

In these systems, cell adhesion is enabled by the assembly of protein nanosheets that display high interfacial shear moduli and elasticity. However, to date, most successful systems reported to support cell adhesion to liquid substrates have been based on co-assemblies of protein and reactive co-surfactants, which limit the translation of bioemulsions. In this report, we describe the design of protein nanosheets based on two globular proteins, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and β-lactoglobulin (BLG), biofunctionalised with RGDSP peptides to enable cell adhesion. The interfacial mechanics of BSA and BLG assemblies at fluorinated liquid-water interfaces is studied by interfacial shear rheology, with and without co-surfactant acyl chloride. Conformational changes associated with globular protein assembly are studied by circular dichroism and protein densities at fluorinated interfaces are evaluated via surface plasmon resonance. Biofunctionalisation mediated by sulfo-succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC) is studied by fluorescence microscopy. On the basis of the relatively high elasticities observed in the case of BLG nanosheets, even in the absence of co-surfactant, the adhesion and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells on bioemulsions stabilized by RGD-functionalized protein nanosheets is studied. To account for the high cell spreading and proliferation observed at these interfaces, despite initial moderate interfacial elasticities, the deposition of fibronectin fibers at the surface of corresponding microdroplets is characterized by immunostaining and confocal microscopy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of achieving high cell proliferation on bioemulsions with protein nanosheets assembled without co-surfactants and establish strategies for rational design of scaffolding proteins enabling the stabilization of interfaces with strong shear mechanics and elasticity, as well as bioactive and cell adhesive properties.

This information is routinely obtained by high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) techniques. In applications to fixed tissue, however, diffusion-weighted imaging suffers from an inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and limited spatial resolution, leading to high demands on the performance of the gradient system in order to mitigate these limitations. In the current work, high angular resolution susceptibility imaging (HARSI) is proposed as a novel, phase-based methodology to estimate ODFs. A multiple gradient-echo dataset was acquired in an entire fixed chimpanzee brain at 61 orientations by reorienting the specimen in the magnetic field. The constant solid angle method was adapted for estimating phase-based ODFs. HARDI data were also acquired for comparison. HARSI yielded information on whole-brain fiber architecture, including identification of peaks of multiple bundles that resembled features of the HARDI results. Distinct differences between both methods suggest that susceptibility properties may offer complementary microstructural information.

Microbial enrichments to obtain novel isolates with slower growth rates or physiologies adapted to low nutrient environments are plagued by intrinsic biases for fastest-growing species when using standard laboratory isolation protocols. New cultivation tools to minimize these biases and enrich for less well-studied taxa are needed. In this study, we developed a high-throughput bacterial enrichment platform based on single cell encapsulation and growth within double emulsions (GrowMiDE). We showed that GrowMiDE can cultivate many different microorganisms and enrich for novel taxa that are never observed in traditional batch enrichments. For example, preventing dominance of the enrichment by fast-growing microbes due to nutrient privatization within the double emulsion droplets allowed cultivation of novel Negativicutes and Methanobacteria from stool samples in rich media enrichment cultures. In competition experiments between growth rate and growth yield specialist strains, GrowMiDE enrichments prevented competition for shared nutrient pools and enriched for slower-growing but more efficient strains.

Despite the increasing interest in trEM among the cryo-EM community, making trEM samples with a time resolution below 100 ms remains challenging. Here we report the design and the realization of a time-resolved cryo-plunger that combines a droplet-based microfluidic mixer with a laser-induced generator of microjets that allows rapid initiation of reaction and rapid plunge-freezing of cryo-EM grids. Using this approach, a time resolution of 5 ms was achieved and the protein density map was reconstructed to a spatial resolution of 2.1 Å.

However, this plasticity may be limited by physiological or energetic constraints, which are potentially exacerbated by other environmental stressors. For instance, chemical contamination may elevate energetic costs and have endocrine disrupting effects that undermine thermoregulation. We leveraged advanced biologging techniques to elucidate how Tb varies with different behavioral states and environmental conditions in a keystone Arctic seabird, the little auk (Alle alle). We additionally evaluated whether mercury (Hg) contamination independently affected Tb, or limited or increased state-dependent changes in Tb. Tb was highest and relatively invariable when birds were at the colony, and rebounded when birds were resting on sea ice, following declines while foraging (diving) in polar waters. These results suggest that the colony and sea ice function as thermal refuges for little auks. In addition, Tb increased with ambient temperature and relative humidity across behavioral states, and increased with wind speed when birds were flying. Little auks with higher Hg levels had higher, less variable, Tb across behaviors and environmental contexts, perhaps reflecting increased metabolic rates linked to detoxification costs. Results provide evidence for environment- and contaminant-related effects on Tb, but not interactive effects between the two, and suggest that loss of sea ice and increased environmental contamination under global change may have serious implications for Tb regulation and energy balance.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.10.18.512690,Body Temperature;Prednisolone,NA,

We found that the protein content of the ECM generated from vEDS donor fibroblasts differed significantly from ECM from healthy donors, including upregulation of collagen subtypes and other proteins related to ECM structural integrity. We further found that ECM generated from a donor with a glycine substitution mutation was characterized by increased glycosaminoglycan content and unique viscoelastic mechanical properties, including increased time constant for stress relaxation, resulting in a decrease in migratory speed of human aortic endothelial cells when seeded on the ECM. Collectively, these results demonstrate that causal COL3A1 mutations lead to the synthesis of ECM that differs in composition, structure, and mechanical properties from healthy donors.

Anisotropic substrate topography is a ubiquitous cue that leads to cellular elongation and alignment, a process termed contact guidance, whose underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Additionally, whether contact guidance responses are similar in single cells and in cellular monolayers is unknown. Here, we address these questions in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) that in vivo form a monolayer that lines blood vessels. Culturing single ECs on microgrooved substrates that constitute an idealized mimic of anisotropic basement membrane topography elicits a strong, groove depth-dependent contact guidance response. Interestingly, this response is greatly attenuated in confluent monolayers. While contact guidance in single cells is principally driven by persistence bias of cell protrusions in the direction of the grooves and is surprisingly insensitive to actin stress fiber disruption, cell shape and alignment in dense EC monolayers are driven by the organization of the basement membrane secreted by the cells, which leads to a loss of interaction with the microgrooves. The findings of distinct contact guidance mechanisms in single ECs and in EC monolayers promise to inform strategies aimed at designing topographically patterned endovascular devices.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.10.18.512697,,NA,

This transition involved three processes: cells remained attached to one another to form groups, cells within these groups differentiated to perform different tasks, and the groups evolved new reproductive strategies1–5. Recent experiments identified selective pressures and mutations that can drive the emergence of simple multicellularity and cell differentiation6–11 but the evolution of life cycles, in particular, how simple multicellular forms reproduce has been understudied. The selective pressure and mechanisms that produced a regular alternation between single cells and multicellular collectives are still unclear12. To probe the factors regulating simple multicellular life cycles, we examined a collection of wild isolates of the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae12. We found that all these strains can exist as multicellular clusters, a phenotype that is controlled by the mating type locus and strongly influenced by the nutritional environment. Inspired by this variation, we engineered inducible dispersal in a multicellular laboratory strain and demonstrated that a regulated life cycle has an advantage over constitutively single-celled or constitutively multicellular life cycles when the environment alternates between favoring intercellular cooperation (a low sucrose concentration) and dispersal (a patchy environment generated by emulsion). Our results suggest that simple multicellularity in wild isolates could be under selection and is regulated by their genetic composition and the environments they encounter and that alternating patterns of resource availability may have played a role in the evolution of life cycles.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.10.14.512267,"Social Control, Informal;Social Control, Formal",NA,

Here we report amino acids essential for the activity of AtNAS1 based on structural modeling and site-directed mutagenesis. An enzyme-coupled continuous activity assay allowed us to compare differing NAS proteins identified through multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses. In most class Ia and b NAS proteins of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous angiosperm plants, respectively, the core-NAS domain is fused to a variable C-terminal domain. Compared to fungal and moss NAS (class III) that consist merely of the core-NAS domain, NA biosynthetic activities of the four paralogous Arabidopsis NAS proteins were far lower. Yet their C-terminally trimmed core-NAS variants exhibited strongly elevated activities. Out of 320 amino acids of AtNAS1, twelve, 287-TRGCMFMPCNCS-298, accounted for the auto-inhibitory effect of the C-terminus, with approximately one third contributed by N296 within a CNCS motif that is conserved in Arabidopsis. No detectable NA biosynthesis was mediated by two representatives of groups of plant NAS proteins that naturally lack the C-terminal domain, class Ia Arabidopsis halleri NAS5, and Medicago truncatula NAS2 of class II which is found in dicots and diverged early during the evolution of flowering plants.

The ability of glioblastoma cells to diffusely spread into neighboring healthy brain makes complete surgical resection nearly impossible and contributes to the recurrent disease faced by most patients. Although research into the impact of iron on glioblastoma has addressed proliferation, there has been little investigation into how cellular iron impacts the ability of glioblastoma cells to migrate - a key question especially in the context of the diffuse spread observed in these tumors. Herein, we show that increasing cellular iron content results in decreased migratory capacity of human glioblastoma cells. The decrease in migratory capacity was accompanied by a decrease in cellular polarization in the direction of movement. Expression of CDC42, a Rho GTPase that is essential for both cellular migration and establishment of polarity in the direction of cell movement, was reduced upon iron treatment. Bioinformatic analysis of CDC42 mRNA revealed a potential iron-responsive element that may contribute to the regulation of CDC42 by iron. We then analyzed a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of human glioblastoma samples and found that cells at the tumor periphery had a gene signature that is consistent with having lower levels of cellular iron. Altogether, our results suggest that cellular iron content is impacting glioblastoma cell migratory capacity and that cells with higher iron levels exhibit reduced motility.Competing Interest StatementJ.R.C is a founder and chairman of the board of Siderobioscience LLC, a company founded on patented technology for management of iron deficiency.

However, there is scant information regarding its toxicological effects. Here we asked whether 2,4-DTBP is a potential obesogen. Using a human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) adipogenesis assay, we found that exposure to 2,4-DTBP led to increased lipid accumulation and expression of adipogenic marker genes. Antagonist assays revealed that 2,4-DTBP increased lipid accumulation by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)-retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer. 2,4-DTBP likely activated the PPARγ/RXRα heterodimer by activating RXRα but not directly binding to PPARγ. We confirmed that 2,4-DTBP directly bound to RXRα by solving the crystal structure of this complex, then predicted and demonstrated that related compounds could also activate RXRα. Our study demonstrated that 2,4-DTBP and related chemicals could act as obesogens and endocrine disruptors via RXR. These data showed that 2,4-DTBP belongs to a family of compounds whose endocrine-disrupting and obesogenic effects can be strongly modulated by their chemical composition and that structure-activity studies such as the present one could help guide the rational development of safer antioxidants.SYNOPSIS Little research exists on the effects of commercially valuable antioxidants on biological systems.

Cellular actin networks consume matter and energy to sustain their dynamics, while maintaining their appearance. This behavior, called ‘dynamic steady state’, enables cells to sense and adapt to their environment. However, how structural stability can be maintained during the constant turnover of a limited actin monomer pool is poorly understood. To answer this question, we developed an experimental system using actin bead motility in a compartment with a limited amount of monomer. We used the speed and the size of the actin comet tails to evaluate the system’s monomer consumption and its lifetime. We established the relative contribution of actin assembly, disassembly and recycling for a bead movement over tens of hours. Recycling mediated by cyclase-associated proteins is the key step in allowing the reuse of monomers for multiple assembly cycles. Energy supply and protein aging are also factors that limit the lifetime of actin turnover.

By simultaneously integrating multiple profiling methods, multi-omic analysis can define generalizable microbial pro-cesses, and is especially useful in understanding complex conditions such as Autism. Challenges with integrating heterogeneous data produced by multiple profiling methods can be overcome using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a promising natural language processing technique that identifies topics in heterogeneous documents.In this study, we apply LDA to multi-omic microbial data (16S rRNA amplicon, shotgun metagenomic, shotgun metatranscriptomic, and untargeted metabolomic profiling) from the stool of 81 children with and without Autism. We identify topics, or microbial processes, that summarize complex phenomena occurring within gut microbial communities. We then subset stool samples by topic distribution, and identify metabolites, specifically neurotransmitter precursors and fatty acid derivatives, that differ significantly between children with and without Autism. We identify clusters of topics, deemed “cross-omic topics”, which we hypothesize are representative of generalizable microbial processes observable regardless of profiling method. Interpreting topics, we find each represents a particular diet, and we heuristically label each cross-omic topic as: healthy/general function, age-associated function, transcriptional regulation, and opportunistic pathogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors declare a conflict of interest.

However, absorbance activated droplet sorting (AADS) is currently ∼10-fold slower than typical fluorescence activated droplet sorting (FADS), meaning that, in comparison, a larger portion of sequence space is inaccessible due to throughput constraints. Here we improve AADS to reach kHz sorting speeds in an order of magnitude increase over previous designs, with close-to-ideal sorting accuracy. This is achieved by a combination of (i) the use of refractive index matching oil that improves signal quality by removal of side scattering (increasing the sensitivity of absorbance measurements); (ii) a sorting algorithm capable of reaching 4 kHz with an Arduino Due; and (iii) a chip design that transmits product detection better into sorting decisions without false positives, namely a single-layered inlet to space droplets further apart and injections of ‘bias oil’ providing a fluidic barrier preventing droplets from entering the incorrect sorting channel.

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) droplets allows sorting on commercially available FACS machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream sequencing and PCR analyses. However, DE droplets must be within the range of large cells (&amp;lt;20 pl) for sorting on standard cytometers, posing challenges for molecular biology as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, but that this cleavage can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis that simultaneously inactivates inhibitory lysate components. We further show that the magnitude of RT-PCR inhibition depends strongly on cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL double emulsion droplets with fluorescence detectable via FACS.

Their known toxicity on aquatic biota and their longevity in the environment has encouraged research on biodegradable alternatives such as rhamnolipids. While previous research has investigated the effects of biological surfactants on single species biofilms, there remains a lack of information regarding the effects of synthetic and biological surfactants in freshwater ecosystems. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to test how the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and the biological surfactant rhamnolipid altered community composition and metabolic activity of freshwater biofilms. Biofilms were cultured in the flumes using lake water from Lake Lunz in Austria, under high (300 ppm) and low (150 ppm) concentrations of either surfactant over a four-week period. Our results show that both surfactants significantly affected microbial diversity. Up to 36% of microbial operational taxonomic units were lost after surfactant exposure. Rhamnolipid exposure also increased the production of the extracellular enzymes, leucine aminopeptidase and glucosidase, while SDS exposure reduced leucine aminopeptidase and glucosidase. This study demonstrates that exposure of freshwater biofilms to chemical and biological surfactants caused a reduction of microbial diversity and changes in biofilm metabolism, exemplified by shifts in extracellular enzyme activities.Key PointsMicrobial biofilm diversity decreased significantly after surfactant exposure.Exposure to either surfactant altered extracellular enzyme activity.Overall metabolic activity was not altered, suggesting functional redundancy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2021.07.30.454494,Biotransformation;Surface-Active Agents,NA,

Existing registration methods often rely on serial histological sampling or significant manual input, providing limited scope to work with a large number of stand-alone histology sections. Here we present a customisable pipeline to automate the registration of stand-alone histology sections to whole-brain MRI data.Methods Our pipeline registers stained histology sections to whole-brain post-mortem MRI in 4 stages, with the help of two photographic intermediaries: a block face image (to undistort histology sections) and coronal brain slice photographs (to insert them into MRI space). Each registration stage is implemented as a configurable stand-alone Python script using our novel platform, Tensor Image Registration Library (TIRL), which provides flexibility for wider adaptation. We report our experience of registering 87 PLP-stained histology sections from 14 subjects and perform various experiments to assess the accuracy and robustness of each stage of the pipeline.Results All 87 histology sections were successfully registered to MRI. Histology-to-block registration (Stage 1) achieved 0.2-0.4 mm accuracy, better than commonly used existing methods. Block-to-slice matching (Stage 2) showed great robustness in automatically identifying and inserting small tissue blocks into whole brain slices with 0.2 mm accuracy. Simulations demonstrated sub-voxel level accuracy (0.13 mm) of the slice-to-volume registration (Stage 3) algorithm, which was observed in over 200 actual brain slice registrations, compensating 3D slice deformations up to 6.5 mm. Stage 4 combined the previous stages and generated refined pixelwise aligned multi-modal histology-MRI stacks.Conclusions Our open-source pipeline provides robust automation tools for registering stand-alone histology sections to MRI data with sub-voxel level precision, and the underlying framework makes it readily adaptable to a diverse range of microscopy-MRI studies.HighlightsNew software framework for prototyping bespoke image registration pipelinesAutomated pipeline to register stand-alone histology sections to whole-brain MRINovel deformable slice-to-volume registration algorithmNo strict necessity for serial histological sectioning for MRI-histology registrationCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.08.11.503605,Brain;Congenital Abnormalities,NA,

As revascularization is a slow process relative to the proliferation of bacteria and the onset and spread of tissue necrosis, extensive tissue damage and loss can occur. Necrosis can spread rapidly, and treatment options are limited such that loss of tissue in ischemic tissue following necrosis onset is considered unavoidable and irreversible.Oxygen delivery from biomaterials exploiting aqueous decomposition of peroxy-compounds has shown some potential in overcoming the supply limitations caused by quite short oxygen diffusion distances in tissues by creating higher concentration gradients than can be attained by air saturated solutions or by distributing oxygen supply throughout a scaffold or construct by using particulate formulations. These have found application in tissue preservation, bioinks, creation of 3D tissue analogues etc. In preclinical models among the more exciting reports was a single study demonstrating reduction of ischemic skin necrosis albeit only short term using short term sub dermal delivery of oxygen below ischemic skin flaps. To explore this effect further, we developed an implantable solid peroxide-biomaterial based system with reduced hydrogen peroxide release by virtue of incorporation of minerals to catalytically decompose it in a much longer flap than examined previously. Blood flow in this flap reduced from essentially normal to essentially zero, along its 9cm length. Without treatment ∼50% of the total flap was necrotic in 2-4 days. In both groups, complete necrosis in the distal third of the flap with no observable flood flow was observed. But in the middle low blood flow region of the flap, treatment did prevent necrosis. This study indicated that subdermal oxygen delivery alone cannot completely mitigate dermal necrosis if no blood flow is present, but it could improve the survival of partially tissue at least in the short term which could find application to augment conventional treatments or to gain time until surgical intervention.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.07.31.502155,Biocompatible Materials;Oxygenators;Skin,NA,

In accordance with the simulations, stabilization of insulin is demonstrated by single halogen atoms at the ortho position of an invariant phenylalanine (2-F-PheB24, 2-Cl-PheB24 and 2-Br-PheB24; ΔΔGu = -0.5 to -1.0 kcal/mol) located at the edge of a protein crevice.

Physical deformation of cells passing through a constriction in a microfluidic channel has been shown to create transient membrane perturbations that allow passive diffusion of materials from the outside to the interior of the cell. This mechanical approach to intracellular delivery is simple to implement and fits the criteria outlined above. However, available microfluidic platforms that operate through this mechanism are traditionally constructed from rigid channels with fixed dimensions that suffer from irreversible clogging and incompatibility with larger size distributions of cells. Here we report a flexible and elastically deformable microfluidic channel, and we leverage this elasticity to dynamically generate temporary constrictions with any given size within the channel width parameters.

By tuning the size of the constriction appropriately, we show the successful delivery of GFP-coding plasmids to the interior of three mammalian cell lines and fluorescent gold nanoparticles to HEK293 FT cells all while maintaining a high cell viability rate.

Traditionally, researchers employ expertise and literature review to identify confounders. Uncontrolled confounding from unidentified confounders threatens validity while conditioning on intermediate variables (mediators) weakens estimates, and conditioning on common effects (colliders) induces bias. Additionally, erroneously conditioning on variables playing multiple roles introduces bias. In a use case studying depression as a potential independent risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we introduce a novel knowledge graph application enabling causal feature selection from computable literature-derived knowledge and biomedical ontologies to address these challenges.Methods Using the output from three machine reading systems, we harmonized the computable knowledge extracted from a scoped literature corpus. Next, we applied logical closure operations to infer missing knowledge and mapped the outputs to target terminologies. We then combined the outputs with ontology-grounded resources using a robust KG framework developed by computational biologists. Next, we translated epidemiological definitions of confounder, collider, and mediator into queries for searching the KG and summarized the roles played by the variables identified. Finally, we analyzed a selection of variables and reasoning paths in the search results.Results Confounder search yielded 128 confounders, including 58 phenotypes, 47 drugs, and 35 genes. Search also identified 23 collider and 16 mediator phenotypes. Only 31 of the 58 confounder phenotypes were found to behave exclusively as confounders. The remaining 27 phenotypes also play other roles, and 7 of the 21 confounders identified by both the KG and the literature were identified as being exclusively confounders. Stroke was an example of a variable playing all three roles.Discussion Our findings suggest that our KG application could augment human expertise while confirming the complexity of selecting potential confounders for depression with AD. Imperfect concept mapping introduced errors, and the small literature corpus limited the scope of search results.Conclusion Our results suggest that our method may widely apply to causal feature selection. However, the search results need to be reviewed by human experts and tested empirically, and further work is required to optimize KG output for human consumption.• Knowledge of causal variables and their roles is essential for causal inference.• We show how to search a knowledge graph (KG) for causal variables and their roles.• The KG combines literature-derived knowledge with ontology-grounded knowledge.• We design queries to search the KG for confounder, collider, and mediator roles.• KG search reveals variables in these roles for depression and Alzheimer’s disease.Graphical abstract Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.07.18.500549,Causality;Risk Factors,NA,

Mammals have two canonical Pumilio proteins, PUM1 and PUM2, which are known to act in many biological processes, including embryonic development, neurogenesis, cell cycle regulation and genomic stability. Here, we characterized a new role of both PUM1 and PUM2 in regulating cell morphology, migration, and adhesion in T-REx-293 cells, in addition to previously known defects in growth rate. Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes in PDKO cells for both cellular component and biological process showed enrichment in categories related to adhesion and migration. PDKO cells had a collective cell migration rate significantly lower than that of WT cells and displayed changes in actin morphology. In addition, during growth, PDKO cells aggregated into clusters (clumps) due to an inability to escape cell-cell contacts. Addition of extracellular matrix (Matrigel) alleviated the clumping phenotype. Collagen IV (ColIV), a major component of Matrigel, was shown to be the driving force in allowing PDKO cells to monolayer appropriately, however, ColIV protein levels remained unperturbed in PDKO cells. This study characterizes a novel cellular phenotype associated with cellular morphology, migration, and adhesion which can aid in developing better models for PUM function in both developmental processes and disease.",,10.1101/2022.07.19.500580,,NA,

By combining bacterial genetics and diet manipulation, we demonstrate that diet-derived L-arabinose provides S. Tm a competitive advantage in the gut. We show that expansion of S.

If the impact of lamin A/C alterations is well described at the molecular and nuclear scales, notably on nuclear mechanics, their effects on cells and tissues need to be clarified. Here, we used a microfluidic device to force cells into constrictions and infer their mechanical properties. We benchmarked the mechanical response of whole cells and isolated nuclei from a healthy individual to that of prematurely senescent cells (i) affected by the lamin A/C R482W mutation associated to type-2 familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD2), or treated by a protease inhibitor which alters lamin A/C production. We further challenged the cells with cytoskeletal drugs to destabilize the actin and microtubule networks. We found that senescent cells are more viscous than non-senescent ones, and that this change is not explained solely by mechanical changes in nuclei. Rather, we showed a major contribution from the cytoskeleton and uncovered an unexpected role of microtubules in prematurely senescent cells. These results suggest that lamin A/C not only impacts the nucleus but also its interplay with the cytoskeleton.

While acute cholinergic toxicity has been extensively studied, chronic effects on other neurons are less understood. Here, we demonstrated that the OP pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and its oxon metabolite are dopaminergic neurotoxicants in Caenorhabditis elegans. CPF treatment led to inhibition of mitochondrial complex II, II + III, and V in rat liver mitochondria, while CPF oxon did not (complex II + III, and IV inhibition observed only at high doses). While the effect on C. elegans cholinergic behavior was mostly reversible with toxicant washout, dopamine-associated deficits persisted, suggesting dopaminergic neurotoxicity was irreversible. CPF reduced the mitochondrial content in a dose-dependent manner and the fat modulatory genes cyp-35A2 and cyp-35A3 were found to have a key role in CPF neurotoxicity. These findings were consistent with in vitro effects of CPF and CPF oxon on nuclear receptor signaling and fatty acid/steroid metabolism observed in ToxCast assays. Two-way hierarchical analysis revealed in vitro effects on estrogen receptor (ER,) pregnane X receptor (PXR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) pathways as well as neurotoxicity of chlorpyrifos, malathion, and diazinon, while these effects were not detected in malaoxon and diazoxon. Taken together, our study suggests that mitochondrial toxicity and metabolic effects of CPF, but not CPF-oxon, have a key role of CPF neurotoxicity in the low-dose, chronic exposure.

Furthermore, we have used confocal fluorescence microscopy and automated quantitative image analysis to assess whether host cells respond to hyphae through spatial redistribution of organelles.We find that subsidiary cells construct papillae that are accurately aligned with hyphal position even when hyphae are occluded by guard cells.

Peroxisome populations in subsidiary cells show distributions with modes weakly correlated with hyphal position but do not differ significantly between compatible and incompatible interactions.Our data suggest local changes to cell wall architecture and focal accumulation of organelles in subsidiary cells could play roles in crop defence during host leaf penetration by Z. tritici.

These molecules are frequently metabolized to increase polarity and subsequent excretion. During sample preparation, deconjugation of phase II metabolites is a critical step to capture the total exposure to chemicals in liquid chromatography mass spectrometry assays (LC-MS). Knowledge on deconjugation efficiencies of different enzymes and the extend of conjugation in human biofluids has primarily been investigated for single compounds or individual chemical classes. In this study, the performance of three β-glucuronidase and arylsulfatase mixtures from H. pomatia, from recombinant sources (BGS™), and from Escherichia coli combined with recombinant arylsulfatase (ASPC™) was compared and the efficiency of phase II deconjugation was monitored in breast milk, urine and plasma. An innovative LC-MS/MS biomonitoring method encompassing more than 80 highly diverse xenobiotics (e.g., plasticizers, industrial chemicals, mycotoxins, phytoestrogens, pesticides) was utilized for the comprehensive investigation of phase II conjugation in experiments investigating levels in breast milk and urine obtained from breastfeeding women. Overall, it was confirmed that H. pomatia is the most efficient enzyme in hydrolyzing different classes of xenobiotics for future exposome-scale biomonitoring studies. The recombinant BGS™ formulation, however, provided better results for breast milk samples, primarily due to lower background contamination, a major issue when employing the typically applied crude H. pomatia extracts.

The increased -inhomogeneity at ≥ 7T and significantly larger saturation pulse flip angles which are often used for postmortem studies exceed the limits where previous MTsat correction methods are applicable. Here, we develop a calibration-based correction model and procedure, and validate and evaluate it in postmortem 7T data of whole chimpanzee brains.Theory The dependence of MTsat was investigated by varying the off-resonance saturation pulse flip angle. For the range of saturation pulse flip angles applied in typical experiments on postmortem tissue, the dependence was close to linear. A linear model with a single calibration constant C is proposed to correct bias in MTsat by mapping it to the reference value of the saturation pulse flip angle.Methods C was estimated voxel-wise in five postmortem chimpanzee brains. “Individual-based global parameters” were obtained by calculating the mean C within individual specimen brains and “group-based global parameters” by calculating the means of the individual-based global parameters across the five brains.Results The linear calibration model described the data well, though C was not entirely independent of the underlying tissue and . Individual-based and group-based global correction parameters (C = 1.2) led to visible, quantifiable reductions of -biases in high resolution MTsat maps.Conclusion The presented model and calibration approach effectively corrects for in-homogeneities in postmortem 7T data.Competing Interest StatementWe would like to note as a potential conflict of interest that the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences has an institutional research agreement with Siemens Healthcare.

Humans are chronically exposed to complex chemical mixtures and, correspondingly, researchers are disentangling the contribution of different contaminants to human neuropathologies. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are biopersistent pollutants and, due to their diverse applications, have become global contaminants. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a prevalent PFAS congener, impairs humoral immunity; however, its impact on innate immunity is unclear. Given the critical roles of innate immune cells, namely microglia, in brain development and homeostasis, we asked whether exposure adversely affects microglial function. Herein, we demonstrate developmental PFOS exposure produces microglial activation and upregulation of the microglia activation gene p2ry12. PFOS-induced microglial activation heightened microglial responses to brain injury, in the absence of increased cell death or inflammation. Use of the photoconvertible calcium indicator CaMPARI revealed PFOS exposure heightened neural activity, while optogenetic silencing of neurons was sufficient to normalize microglial responses to injury. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid, an immunotoxic PFAS, did not alter neuronal activity or microglial behavior, further supporting a role for neural activity as a critical modifier of microglial function.

Microscopic image analysis showed that LAP1-depleted hepatocytes contain frequent nuclear LDs, which differ from cytoplasmic LDs in their associated proteins. We found type 1 nucleoplasmic reticula, which are invaginations of the inner nuclear membrane, are often associated with nuclear LDs in these hepatocytes. Furthermore, in vivo depletion of the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A and C from mouse hepatocytes led to severely abnormal nuclear morphology, but significantly fewer nuclear LDs than were observed upon depletion of LAP1.

Finally, depletion of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein did not change the frequency of nuclear LDs in LAP1-depleted hepatocytes, suggesting that it is not necessary for the biogenesis of nuclear LDs in these cells.

We further demonstrate that the bacteria-generated corner flow only occurs when the corner angle is less than a critical value, which can be predicted from the contact angle of the bacterial solution. Furthermore, we show that the corner flow has a maximum height due to the roundness or cutoff of corners. The mechanistic understanding and mathematical theories of bacterial spreading presented in this study will help improve predictions of bacterial spreading in soil, where corners are ubiquitous, and facilitate future designs of soil contamination mitigation and other bioremediation projects.Importance The spread of bacterial cells in soil regulates soil biogeochemical cycles, increases the possibility of soil and groundwater contamination, and controls the efficiency of many bacteria-based bioremediation projects. However, mechanistic understanding of bacterial spreading in soil remains incomplete due to a lack of direct or in-situ observations. Here, we simulate confined spaces of soil using a transparent material with similar hydrophobicity as hydrocarbon-covered soil and directly visualize the spread of two common soil bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens. We show that both bacteria can generate vertical flows along sharp corners of the transparent chamber. The velocity of the bacterial corner flow is several millimeters per hour. We further demonstrate that the corner flow was generated by bacteria-produced bio-surfactants, which are soap-like chemicals and turn nonwetting solid surfaces into wetting surfaces. Our results will help improve predictions of bacterial spreading in soil and facilitate designs of soil-related bioremediation projects.",,10.1101/2022.06.20.496927,Surface-Active Agents;Bacteria,NA,

This leaves neurons susceptible to loss-of-function of maternal UBE3A. Indeed, Angelman syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, is caused by maternal UBE3A deficiency. A promising therapeutic approach to treating Angelman syndrome is to reactivate the intact paternal UBE3A by suppressing UBE3A-ATS. Prior studies show that many neurological phenotypes of maternal Ube3a knockout mice can only be rescued by reinstating Ube3a expression in early development, indicating a restricted therapeutic window for Angelman syndrome. Here we report that reducing Ube3a-ATS by antisense oligonucleotides in juvenile or adult maternal Ube3a knockout mice rescues the abnormal electroencephalogram rhythms and sleep disturbance, two prominent clinical features of Angelman syndrome. Importantly, the degree of phenotypic improvement correlates with the increase of Ube3a protein levels. These results indicate that the therapeutic window of genetic therapies for Angelman syndrome is broader than previously thought, and electroencephalogram power spectrum and sleep architecture should be used to evaluate the clinical efficacy of therapies.Competing Interest StatementAS, FR, and PJ are paid employees of Ionis Pharmaceuticals.

Light-sheet microscopy shows that trophoblast cells undergo Rac1-dependent collective migration upon implantation, displacing Reichert’s membrane and generating space for egg cylinder growth. The key role of coordination between trophoblast migration and embryo growth is verified by experimentally manipulating the migration velocity and geometry of the engineered uterus. Modeling the implanting embryo as a wetting droplet links the tissue shape dynamics to underlying changes in trophoblast adhesion and suggests that the corresponding tension release facilitates egg cylinder formation.

PFAS are characterized by their fluorinated carbon chains that make them hard to degrade and bioaccumulate in human and animals. Toxicological studies have shown PFAS toxic effects: cytotoxicity, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity. Two major categories of PFAS are perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid (PFCA) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid (PFSA). In this study, we used a mouse-oocyte-in-vitro-maturation (IVM) system to study how the structures of PFAS, such as carbon-chain length and functional groups, determine their reproductive toxicity. We found the toxicity of PFAS is elevated with increasing carbon-chain length and the inclusion of the sulfonate group. Specifically, at 600 µM, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) reduced the rates of both germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and polar body extrusion (PBE) as well as induced the formation of relatively large polar bodies. However, the shorter PFSA, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), and all PFCA did not show similar adverse cytotoxicity. We further examined mitochondria and cytoskeleton, two essential factors for cell division, in PFOS- and PFHxS-treated oocytes. We found that 600 µM PFHxS and PFOS exposure induced excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Cytoskeleton analysis revealed that PFHxS and PFOS exposure induced chromosome misalignment, abnormal F-actin organization, elongated the spindle formation, and symmetric division in the treated oocytes.

In bacteria, the oxidative stress response limits the formation of mutagenic reactive oxygen species (ROS) under diverse stress conditions. This suggests that the dynamics of the oxidative stress response are closely tied to the timing of the mutation supply that fuels genetic adaptation to stress. Here, we explored how mutation rates change in real-time in Escherichia coli cells during continuous hydrogen peroxide treatment in microfluidic channels. By visualising nascent DNA replication errors, we uncovered that sudden oxidative stress causes a burst of mutations. We developed a range of single-molecule and single-cell microscopy assays to determine how these mutation dynamics arise from phenotypic adaptation mechanisms. Signalling of peroxide stress by the transcription factor OxyR rapidly induces ROS scavenging enzymes. However, an adaptation delay leaves cells vulnerable to the mutagenic and toxic effects of hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction. Resulting DNA damage is counteracted by a spike in DNA repair activities during the adaptation delay. Prior stress exposure or constitutive OxyR induction allowed cells to avoid the burst of mutations. Similar observations for alkylation stress show that mutation bursts are a general phenomenon associated with adaptation delays.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.05.25.493234,Oxidative Stress;Mutation;Bacteria,NA,

Traditionally, simultaneous multiplexing of liquid handling and cell loading poses a challenge in the design of high-throughput MPS.

Here, we solve the 3.2 Å cryo-EM structure of the B.megaterium gas vesicle shell made from the structural protein GvpA that self-assembles into hollow helical cylinders closed off by cone-shaped tips. Remarkably, the unique fold adopted by GvpA generates a corrugated cylinder surface typically found in force-bearing thin-walled structures. We identified pores in the vesicle wall that enable gas molecules to freely diffuse in and out of the GV shell, while the exceptionally hydrophobic interior surface effectively repels water. Our results show that gas vesicles consist of two helical half-shells connected through a unique arrangement of GvpA monomers, suggesting a mechanism of gas vesicle biogenesis. Comparative structural analysis confirms the evolutionary conservation of gas vesicle assemblies and reveals molecular details of how the secondary structural protein GvpC reinforces the GvpA shell.

To do so at large-scale, we profiled transcriptomes across 12 cellular environments using 544 immortalized B cell lines from the 1000 Genomes Project. We mapped the genetic basis of gene expression across environments and revealed a context-dependent genetic architecture: the average heritability of gene expression levels increased in treatment relative to control conditions and, on average, each treatment revealed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) at 11% of genes. In total, 22% of all eQTL were context-dependent, and this group was enriched for trait- and disease-associated loci. Further, evolutionary analyses revealed that positive selection has shaped GxE loci involved in responding to immune challenges and hormones, but not man-made chemicals, suggesting there is reduced opportunity for selection to act on responses to molecules recently introduced into human environments.

Critical concentrations of α-Syn LLPS are relatively high under physiological solution conditions. Moreover, α-Syn exhibits delayed LLPS kinetics under certain conditions which deviates from the behaviour predicted by classical homogeneous nucleation theory. In the current body of work, using interferometric light scattering (iSCAT), also known as mass photometry, we experimentally probe that α-Syn can form nanoscale phase separated assemblies/clusters, containing tens to hundreds of molecules— both above and below the critical LLPS concentration down to physiologically relevant scales. The formation of these clusters is instantaneous, even under conditions where the formation of microscopically visible droplets takes several days. However, they account for a very small volume fraction below saturation concentration. The slow growth of the nanoclusters can be attributed to a kinetic barrier which can be overcome by increasing the solution temperature to just below the droplet melting point. We provide reasons for caution in quantifying dilute phase concentrations for α-Syn LLPS samples containing nanoscale droplets—which can only be separated using ultracentrifugation. In addition, we also delineate that the presence of certain surfaces facilitates α-Syn droplet nucleation under conditions of delayed kinetics but is not a mandatory prerequisite for nanocluster formation. Taken together, our findings reveal that phase separation of α-Syn occurs at a wider range of solution conditions than predicted so far and provides an important step towards understanding α-Syn LLPS within physiological scales.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.05.03.490467,,NA,

A 3D-printed module for laser assembly was developed to simplify the optical set up for holographic imaging of cells flowing through a sheath-based microfluidic device. Computational reconstruction of the holograms was performed to localize the cells in 3D and obtain the plane of best focus images to train deep learning models.

A particularly crucial concern is to fully take advantage of scientifically valid Physiologically-Based Kinetic (PBK) models. Nevertheless, risk assessors remain still unwilling in employing PBK models within their daily work. Indeed, PBK models are not often included in current official guidance documents. In addition, most users have limited experience in using modelling in general. So, the complexity of PBK models, together with a lack to evaluation methods of their performances, certainly contributes to their under-use in practical risk assessment.This paper proposes an innovative and unified modelling framework, in both the writing of PBK equations as matrix ordinary differential equations (ODE), and in its exact solving simply expressed with matrix products. This generic PBK solution allows to consider as many as state-variables as needed to quantify chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion processes within living organisms when exposed to chemical substances. This generic PBK model makes possible any compartmentalisation to be considered, as well as all appropriate inter-connections between compartments and with the external medium.We first introduce our PBK modelling framework, with all intermediate steps from the matrix ODE to the exact solution. Then we apply this framework to bioaccumulation testing, before illustrating its concrete use through complementary case studies in terms of species, compounds and model complexity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.04.29.490045,Risk Assessment;Kinetics,NA,

Significant progress has been made towards reliable compartment division, yet mechanisms to segregate the DNA-encoded informational content are still in their infancy. Herein, droplets of DNA Y-motifs are formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Entropy-driven DNA droplet segregation is obtained by cleaving the linking component between two populations of DNA Y-motifs. In addition to enzymatic cleavage, photolabile sites are introduced for spatio-temporally controlled DNA segregation in bulk as well as in cell-sized water-in-oil droplets and giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). Notably, the segregation process is slower in confinement than in bulk. The ionic strength of the solution and the nucleobase sequences are employed to regulate the segregation dynamics. The experimental results are corroborated in a lattice-based theoretical model which mimics the interactions between the DNA Y-motif populations. Altogether, engineered DNA droplets, reconstituted in GUVs, could represent a strategy towards an entropy-driven DNA segregation module within bottom-up assembled synthetic cells.An entropy-driven DNA segregation module for bottom-up assembled synthetic cells is realized. It is based on DNA droplets that are engineered to segregate upon enzymatic or photocleavage inside giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). The segregation kinetics is altered by the confinement, as confirmed by lattice-based numerical simulations. DNA segregation is further controlled by temperature, ionic strengths and nucleobase sequence.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.04.30.489979,DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase,NA,

The changes of biochemical indexes indicated that DCZ exposure inhibited lipid synthesis, lipolysis and lipid transport of F0 males and females. In addition, the composition of gut microbes in males and females was significantly changed, which corresponds to changes in biochemical parameters in liver, intestine and serum. Metabolome analysis showed that pathways related to amino acid metabolism, ATP-binding cassette transporters, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy metabolism were downregulated in the gut of males and females. At 120 days post-fertilization, lipid synthesis, lipolysis and lipid transport of F1 males was upregulated; the composition of microbiota and metabolome of the F1males gut was significantly altered. Overall, we found that long-term exposure to low doses of DCZ inhibited the liver-gut axis in males and females, and the liver-gut axis in F1 males were disturbed even in F1 generation without DCZ exposure.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.04.29.490113,Liver,NA,

Pathological changes in cell-level genetic and physical properties cause jamming, unjamming, and scattering in epithelial migration. Separately, changes in microenvironment stiffness and confinement can produce varying modes of cell migration. However, it remains unclear whether and how mesoscale disruptions in matrix topology alter collective cell migration. To address this question, we microfabricated matrices with stumps of defined geometry, density, and orientation, which serve as obstructions in the path of collectively migrating healthy mammary epithelial cells. Here, we show that cells lose their speed and directionality when moving through dense obstructions, compared to those sparsely spaced. On flat surfaces, leader cells are significantly stiffer than follower cells, while dense obstructions lead to the overall softening of cells. In moving through dense obstructions, epithelial cells lose the sense of leaders and followers in their physical properties, migration phenotypes, and fluidity. Although Rac inhibition reduces obstruction sensitivity, loss of cell-cell cooperation and induction of leader-like phenotype via α-catenin depletion eliminates the effect of matrix obstructions on epithelial migration. Through a lattice-based model, we identify cellular protrusions, polarity, and leader-follower communication as key mechanisms for obstruction-sensitive collective cell migration. Together, microscale cytoskeletal response, mesoscale softening and disorder, and macroscale multicellular communication enable epithelial cell populations to sense topological obstructions encountered in challenging environments. These results reveal that cohesive, healthy populations are more obstruction sensitive than the dysfunctional, aggressive ones. The ‘obstruction-sensitivity’ could add to the emerging disease ‘mechanotypes’ such as cell stiffness and traction forces.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.04.28.489943,,NA,

Unfortunately, the fact that these filters are made of petrochemical-derived, non-biodegradable polymers means that the surge in production has also led to a surge in plastic waste. In this work, we present novel, sustainable filters based on bacterial cellulose (BC) functionalized with low-pressure argon plasma (LPP-Ar). The “green” production process involved BC biosynthesis by Komagataeibacter xylinus, followed by simple purification, homogenization, lyophilization, and finally LPP-Ar treatment. The obtained LPP-Ar-functionalized BC-based material (LPP-Ar-BC-bM) showed excellent antimicrobial and antiviral properties, with no cytotoxicity versus murine fibroblasts in vitro. Further, filters consisting of three layers of LPP-Ar-BC-bM had &amp;gt;99% bacterial and viral filtration efficiency, while maintaining sufficiently low airflow resistance (6 mbar at an airflow of 95 L/min). Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we were able to prepare 80 masks with LPP-Ar-BC-bM filter and ~85% of volunteer medical staff assessed them as good or very good in terms of comfort.

Two unrelated microtubule-binding proteins, TANGLED1 (TAN1) and AUXIN-INDUCED-IN-ROOT-CULTURES9 (AIR9), are together required for normal growth and division-plane orientation in Arabidopsis. tan1 air9 double mutants have synthetic growth and division-plane orientation defects while single mutants lack obvious defects. Here we show that the division-site localized protein, PHRAGMOPLAST-ORIENTING-KINESIN1 (POK1), was aberrantly lost from the division site during metaphase and telophase in tan1 air9 mutants. Since TAN1 and POK1 interact via the first 132 amino acids of TAN1 (TAN11-132), we assessed its localization and function in the tan1 air9 double mutant. TAN11-132 rescued tan1 air9 mutant phenotypes and localized to the division site in telophase. However, replacing six amino-acid residues within TAN11-132 that disrupts POK1-TAN1 interaction in the yeast-two-hybrid system caused loss of both rescue and division-site localization of TAN11-132 in tan1 air9 mutants. Full-length TAN1 with the same alanine substitutions had defects in phragmoplast guidance and reduced TAN1 and POK1 localization at the division site but rescued most tan1 air9 mutant phenotypes. Together, these data suggest that TAN1 and AIR9 are required for POK1 localization, and yet unknown proteins may stabilize TAN1-POK1 interactions.One sentence summary Specific amino acids within TAN1 are required for its correct localization and function partially through interaction with POK1; both TAN1 and AIR9 mediate POK1 division site localization.",,10.1101/2022.04.27.489732,Carrier Proteins;Indoleacetic Acids;Microtubules,NA,

We employ this to externally trigger the reconfiguration of DNA cytoskeletons within GUVs using strand displacement reactions.

The mechanisms of neutrophil trafficking in the lung are distinct from those in the periphery, in part because the pulmonary capillaries are the primary site of neutrophil emigration rather than postcapillary venules. Since the diameter of a neutrophil is greater than the width of most pulmonary capillary segments, they must deform to transit through this capillary network, even at homeostasis. Resistance to deformation is primarily due to cortical actin that is rapidly assembled when a neutrophil is exposed to a priming or activation stimulus, resulting in neutrophil stiffening and subsequent sequestration within the pulmonary capillary network. In the current study, we use a microfluidic assay to characterize neutrophil transit through model capillary-like channels. Using techniques from single-particle tracking, we analyzed the cumulative distribution of neutrophil transit times and resolve population-based effects. We found that vinculin, an actin-binding adaptor protein, plays an essential role in neutrophil stiffening in response to formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP). Vinculin-deficient neutrophils lack the development of a population with slow transit through narrow channels that was observed in both wild-type murine bone marrow neutrophils and HoxB8-conditional progenitor-derived neutrophils. Atomic force microscopy studies provide further evidence that vinculin is required for neutrophil stiffening. Consistent with these findings, we observed that neutrophil sequestration in the lungs of mice is attenuated in the absence of vinculin. Together, our studies indicate that vinculin mediates actin-dependent neutrophil stiffening that leads to their sequestration in capillaries.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.04.24.489286,,NA,

Despite this fundamental role, little is known about how SPACA6 specifically functions. We elucidated the crystal structure of SPACA6 at 2.2-Å resolution, revealing a two-domain protein containing a four-helix bundle and Ig-like β-sandwich connected via a quasi-flexible linker. Based on the structural analysis, we propose SPACA6 is a founding member of a superfamily of gamete fusion-associated proteins, herein dubbed the IST superfamily. The IST superfamily is defined structurally by its distorted four-helix bundle and a pair of disulfide-bonded CXXC motifs. A structure-based search of the AlphaFold human proteome identified more protein members to this superfamily; remarkably, many of these proteins are linked to gamete fusion. The SPACA6 structure and its connection to other IST-superfamily members provide a missing link in our knowledge of mammalian gamete fusion.Significance Statement SPACA6 is a human sperm protein vital for the fusion of gametes, though its exact function remains a mystery. We present the first solved structure of SPACA6: a two-domain fold comprised of an Ig-like domain and a distorted four-helix bundle. Dali searches of the PDB and AlphaFold reveal a family of structurally related proteins, several of which are also known to play a role in gamete fusion; as such, SPACA6 is a founding member of a conserved protein superfamily, dubbed the IST superfamily. Evolutionary analysis to ascertain functionally relevant structural elements in SPACA6 show a conservation of flexibility between the two domains and several conserved surfaces that could function as protein-protein interfaces.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.03.23.484325,,NA,

EDCs are ubiquitous and can be found in a variety of consumer products such as food packaging materials, personal care and household products, plastic additives, and flame retardants. Over the last decade, the impact of EDCs on human health has been widely acknowledged as they have been associated with different endocrine diseases. Among them, a subset called metabolism-disrupting chemicals (MDCs) are able to promote metabolic changes that can lead to the development of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, obesity, hepatic steatosis, and metabolic syndrome, among others. Despite this, today, there are still no definitive and standardized in vitro tools to support the metabolic risk assessment of existing and emerging MDCs for regulatory purposes. Here, we evaluated two different pancreatic cell-based in vitro systems, the murine pancreatic β-cell line MIN6 as well as the human pancreatic β-cell line EndoC- βH1. Both were challenged with a range of relevant concentrations of seven well-known EDCs (bisphenol-A (BPA), bisphenol-S (BPS), bisphenol-F (BPF), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), cadmium chloride (CdCl2) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE)). The screening revealed that most of the tested chemicals have detectable deleterious effects on glucose-stimulated insulin release, insulin content, electrical activity, gene expression, and/or viability. Our data provide new molecular information on the direct effects of the selected chemicals on key aspects of pancreatic β-cell function such as the stimulus-secretion coupling and ion channel activity. In addition, we found that, in general, the sensitivity and responses were comparable to those from other in vivo studies reported in the literature. Overall, our results suggest that both systems can serve as effective tools for rapid screening of potential MDC effects on pancreatic β-cell physiology as well for deciphering and better understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie their action.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.03.22.485270,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Mass Screening,NA,

Here we used the human EndoC-βH1 β-cell line, the rat β-cell line INS-1E and dispersed mouse islet cells to assess the effects of endocrine disruptors on cell viability and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). We tested six chemicals at concentrations within human exposure (from 0.1 pM to 1 μM). Bisphenol-A (BPA) and tributyltin (TBT) were used as controls while four other chemicals, namely perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), triphenylphosphate (TPP), triclosan (TCS) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), were used as “unknowns”. Regarding cell viability, BPA and TBT increased cell death as previously observed. Their mode of action involved the activation of estrogen receptors and PPARγ, respectively. ROS production was a consistent key event in BPA- and TBT-treated cells. None of the other MDCs tested modified viability or ROS production. Concerning GSIS, TBT increased insulin secretion while BPA produced no effects. PFOA decreased GSIS, suggesting that this chemical could be a “new” diabetogenic agent.

While it is well established that single-cell migration is often guided by gradients of chemokines and other chemoattractants, it remains poorly understood how such gradients are generated, maintained and modulated. Combining experiment and theory on leukocyte chemotaxis guided by the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) CCR7, we demonstrate that in addition to its role as the sensory receptor that steers migration, CCR7 also acts as a generator and modulator of chemotactic gradients. Upon exposure to the CCR7 ligand CCL19, dendritic cells (DCs) effectively internalize the receptor and ligand as part of the canonical GPCR-desensitization response. We show that CCR7 internalization also acts as an effective sink for the chemoattractant, thereby dynamically shaping the spatio-temporal distribution of the chemokine. This mechanism drives complex collective migration patterns, enabling DCs to create or sharpen chemotactic gradients. We further show that these self-generated gradients can sustain the long-range guidance of DCs, adapt collective migration patterns to the size and geometry of the environment, as well as provide a guidance cue for other co-migrating cells. Such dual role of CCR7 as a GPCR that both senses and consumes its ligand can thus provide a novel mode of cellular self-organization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.02.22.481445,Leukocytes,NA,

While the public and environmental health impacts of long-term PFAS exposures are poorly understood, elevated blood concentrations of some PFAS are linked with immunotoxicity and increased incidence of some chronic autoimmune diseases in human populations. The goal of this study was to evaluate PFAS exposure and biomarkers related to immune health in populations of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), a protected and predictive sentinel species of adverse effects caused by persistent toxic pollutants. We found that serum PFAS concentrations in a representative population of alligators from the Cape Fear River were increased compared to a reference population of alligators from the adjoining Lumber River basin. The elevated serum PFAS concentrations in the Cape Fear River alligators were associated with increased innate immune activities, and autoimmune-like phenotypes were observed in this population. In addition to evidence of significantly higher double stranded-DNA binding autoantibodies in adult Cape Fear River alligators, our qRT-PCR analysis found remarkably high induction of Interferon-α αsignature genes implicated in the pathology of human autoimmune disease.

When environments have not encountered the potentially hazardous materials in their evolutionary history, existing enzymes have to be repurposed. The recruitment of accidental, typically low-level promiscuous activities provides a head start that, after gene duplication, can adapt and provide a selectable advantage. This evolutionary scenario raises the question whether it is possible to adaptively improve the low-level activity of enzymes recruited from non- (or only recently) contaminated environments quickly to the level of evolved bioremediators.Here we address the evolution of phosphotriesterases (enzymes for hydrolysis of organophosphate pesticides or chemical warfare agents) in such a scenario: In a previous functional metagenomics screening we had identified a promiscuous phosphotriesterase activity of the α/β-hydrolase P91, with an unexpected Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad as the active site motif. We now probe evolvability of P91 using ultrahigh-throughput screening in microfluidic droplets, and test for the first time whether the unique catalytic motif of a cysteine-containing triad can adapt to achieve rates that rival existing phosphotriesterases. These mechanistically distinct enzymes achieve their high rates based on catalysis involving a metal-ion cofactor. A focussed, combinatorial library of P91 (&amp;gt; 105 members) was screened on-chip in microfluidic droplets by quantification of the reaction product, fluorescein. Within only two rounds of evolution P91’s phosphotriesterase activity was increased ≈ 400-fold to a kcat/KM of ≈ 106 M−1s−1, matching the catalytic efficiencies of naturally evolved metal-dependent phosphotriesterases. In contrast to its homologue acetylcholinesterase that suffers suicide inhibition, P91 shows fast de-phosphorylation rates and is rate-limited by the formation of the covalent adduct rather than by its hydrolysis. Our analysis highlights how the combination of focussed, combinatorial libraries with the ultrahigh throughput of droplet microfluidics can be leveraged to identify and enhance mechanistic strategies that have not reached high efficiency in Nature, resulting in alternative reagents with a novel catalytic machinery.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.02.14.480337,Carboxylesterase,NA,

This allows them to effectively traverse compromised physiological barriers and circulate for extended periods of time. While various aspects of nanobubble behavior have been previously examined, their behavior in human whole blood has not yet been explored. Accordingly, herein we examined, for the first time, the short and long-term effects of blood components on nanobubble acoustic response. We observed differences in the kinetics of backscatter from nanobubble suspensions in whole blood compared to bubbles in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), plasma, or red blood cell solutions (RBCs). Specifically, after introducing nanobubbles to fresh human whole blood, signal enhancement gradually increased by 22.8 ± 13.1% throughout our experiment, with peak intensity reached within 145 seconds. In contrast, nanobubbles in PBS had a stable signal with negligible change in intensity (−1.7 ± 3.2%) over 8 minutes. Under the same conditions, microbubbles made with the same lipid formulation showed a −56.8 ± 6.1% decrease in enhancement. Subsequent confocal, fluorescent, and scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed attachment of the nanobubbles to the surface of RBCs, suggesting that direct interactions, or hitchhiking, of nanobubbles on RBCs in the presence of plasma may be a possible mechanism for the observed effects. This phenomenon could be key to extending nanobubble circulation time and has broad implications in drug delivery, where RBC interaction with nanoparticles could be exploited to improve delivery efficiency.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.02.11.480110,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Contrast Media,NA,

ADT causes prostate cancers to shrink in volume, or regress, by inducing epithelial tumor cell apoptosis. In normal, non-neoplastic murine prostate, androgen deprivation via castration induces prostate gland regression that is dependent on TNF signaling. Besides this direct mechanism of action, castration has also been implicated in an indirect mechanism of prostate epithelial cell death which has been described as vascular regression. The initiating event is endothelial cell apoptosis and/or increased vascular permeability. This subsequently leads to reduced blood flow and perfusion, and then hypoxia, which may enhance epithelial cell apoptosis. Castration-induced vascular regression has been observed in both normal and neoplastic prostate. We used photoacoustic, power Doppler, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging, and CD31 immunohistochemical staining of the microvasculature to assess vascular integrity in the period immediately following castration, enabling us to test the role of TNF signaling in vascular regression. In two mouse models of androgen-responsive prostate cancer, TNF signaling blockade using a soluble TNFR2 ligand trap reversed the functional aspects of vascular regression as well as structural changes in the microvasculature, including reduced vessel wall thickness, cross-sectional area and vessel perimeter length. These results demonstrate that TNF signaling is required for vascular regression, most likely inducing endothelial cell apoptosis and increasing vessel permeability. Since TNF is also the critical death receptor ligand for prostate epithelial cells, we propose that TNF is a multi-purpose, comprehensive signal within the prostate cancer micro-environment mediating prostate cancer regression following androgen deprivation.SIGNIFICANCE These studies define TNF as the mediator of androgen deprivation therapy-induced functional and structural vascular damage in prostate tumors.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.02.05.479251,Prostatic Neoplasms;Prostate,NA,

To gain maximum biological insights from these datasets, LC/HRMS peaks should be annotated with chemical and functional information including molecular formula, structure, chemical class and metabolic pathways. Among these, molecular formulas may be assigned to LC/HRMS peaks through matching theoretical and observed isotopic profiles (MS1) of the underlying ionized compound. For this, we have developed the Integrated Data Science Laboratory for Metabolomics and Exposomics – United Formula Annotation (IDSL.UFA) R package. In the untargeted metabolomics validation tests, IDSL.UFA assigned 54.31%-85.51% molecular formula for true positive annotations as the top hit, and 90.58%-100% within the top five hits. Molecular formula annotations were also supported by MS/MS data. We have implemented new strategies to 1) generate formula sources and their theoretical isotopic profiles 2) optimize the formula hits ranking for the individual and the aligned peak lists and 3) scale IDSL.UFA-based workflows for studies with larger sample sizes. Annotating the raw data for a publicly available pregnancy metabolome study using IDSL.UFA highlighted hundreds of new pregnancy related compounds, and also suggested presence of chlorinated perfluorotriether alcohols (Cl-PFTrEAs) in human specimens. IDSL.UFA is useful for human metabolomics and exposomics studies where we need to minimize the loss of biological insights in untargeted LC/HRMS datasets.

Statistical deconvolution of allele frequencies from shotgun metagenomic data into strain genotypes and relative abundances is a promising approach, but existing methods are limited by computational scalability. Here we introduce StrainFacts, a method for strain deconvolution that enables inference across tens of thousands of metagenomes. We harness a “fuzzy” genotype approximation that makes the underlying graphical model fully differentiable, unlike existing methods. This allows parameter estimates to be optimized with gradient-based methods, speeding up model fitting by two orders of magnitude. A GPU implementation provides additional scalability. Extensive simulations show that StrainFacts can perform strain inference on thousands of metagenomes and has comparable accuracy to more computationally intensive tools. We further validate our strain inferences using single-cell genomic sequencing from a human stool sample. Applying StrainFacts to a collection of more than 10,000 publicly available human stool metagenomes, we quantify patterns of strain diversity, biogeography, and linkage-disequilibrium that agree with and expand on what is known based on existing reference genomes.

The fish skin mucus serves as the first barrier against environmental pathogens. The mucus harbors commensal microbes that form the microbiota, impacting the host physiological and immunological regulation. However, how the skin mucosal microbiota responds to the presence of pathogens remains largely unexplored. Thus, little is known about the status of skin mucus prior to the infection with noticeable symptoms. In this study, we aim to investigate the interaction between pathogen and skin mucosal microbiota, as well as the fish skin immune responses in the presence of pathogens. By challenging striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) with different concentrations of bacterial pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila (AH), the skin immune response and the mucosal microbiota were examined by qPCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. We found a pathogen concentration able to stimulate the skin immune response associated with the significant mucosal microbiota change and re-confirmed with the ex vivo fish skin model. Further analysis indicated that the change was attributed to the significant increase in opportunistic pathogens over AH. We concluded that the presence and increase of AH results in dysbiosis of mucosal microbiota that can stimulate skin immune response. We believe our work can shed some light on host-pathogen-commensal microbiota interaction and therefore contribute to aquaculture infection prevention.IMPORTANCE The fish skin mucosal microbiota is essentially the first barrier in response to the presence of pathogens. This study is the first study to elucidate the interaction between the AH, the skin mucosal microbiota, and the striped catfish skin at the initiation stage of infection.

At lab scale, petroleum-based hydrophobic bio-compatible solvents like dodecane can be used as a second phase on top of microbial cultures to act as a physical sink for heterologous hydrocarbon products like isoprenoids. However, this approach has significant drawbacks at scale due to the difficulty of handling solvents and their potential contamination with unwanted byproducts of their manufacture. We discovered that synthetic perfluorocarbon liquids (FCs), commonly used for heat transfer, can also act as physical sinks for microbially produced isoprenoid compounds. FCs are stable, inert, and are amenable to direct liquid-liquid extraction with alcohols for rapid product isolation. These liquids are more dense than water and form a lower phase to microbial cultures rather than an upper phase as with other solvents. Their ability to form an under-layer or ‘underlay’ also enables the cultivation of microbes directly at the FC-culture medium interface via gravity settling, which could open their application for filamentous or mat-forming organisms. We present comparisons of the isoprenoid extraction potential of three commercial FCs: FC-3283, FC-40, and FC-770 with engineered green microalga cultures producing patchoulol, taxadiene, casbene, or 13R(+) manoyl oxide.

For this, we analysed the metabolome of serum from mice with tissue-specific expression of the clock gene Bmal1. Notably, having functional hepatic and muscle clocks can only drive a minority (13%) of the oscillating metabolites in circulation. Conversely, limiting Bmal1 expression to Syt10- expressing neurons (which are enriched in the suprachiasmatic nucleus [SCN], the master pacemaker that regulates circadian rhythms) restores rhythms to 57% of circulatory metabolites and 28% of liver transcripts, and rescues glucose intolerance. Importantly, these parameters were also restored in clock-less mice upon rhythmic feeding, indicating that the central clock mainly regulates metabolic rhythms via behavior. These findings explicate the circadian communication between tissues and highlight the importance of the central clock in governing those signals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.01.24.477514,,NA,

This multi-functional role displayed by NK cells have made them an attractive choice for anti-cancer immunotherapy. A functional NK cell repertoire is generated through cellular education, resulting in heterogeneous NK cell population with distinct capabilities to respond to different stimuli. The application of a high-throughput droplet-based microfluidic platform allows monitoring of NK cell-target cell interactions at single-cell level and in real-time. Through fluorescence-based screening of around 80,000 droplets, with different Effector:Target ratios, a fully automated image analysis allows for the assessment of individual killing events in each droplet over time. We observed a variable response of single NK cells towards different target cells and identified a distinct population of NK cells capable of inducing multiple target lysis, coined as serial killers. To meet the increasing clinical demand for NK cells several sources, such as umbilical cord blood (UCB), have successfully been explored. By assessing the cytotoxic dynamics, we showed that single UCB-derived CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor (HPC)-NK cells display superior anti-tumor cytotoxicity.

It is defined by the balance of tension and pressure forces in the network of microtubules (MTs). As MTs polymerize against the cell periphery, pressure increases and produces pushing forces on the MTOC. How the mechanical interplay between MTs and the actin network is involved in the regulation of these forces remains poorly understood, in particular because its investigation is technically limited by the structural and biochemical complexity of the cell cytoplasm. Here, in a cell-free assay, we used purified proteins to reconstitute the interaction of an aster of dynamic MTs with actin networks of various compositions and architectures in cell-sized microwells. In the absence of actin filaments, the positioning of the MTOC was highly sensitive to variations in MT length. The presence of a bulk actin filament network limited MTs deformation and displacement, and MTOCs were hold in place. In contrast, the assembly of a dense and branched actin network along the edges of the wells centered the MTOCs by preventing MT slippage and thus maintaining an isotropic balance of pushing forces. In agreement with this, an asymmetric peripheral actin network caused the MTOC to decenter by creating an asymmetry in the pushing forces. Numerical simulations demonstrated that steric hindrance by actin networks, at the tip or along the entire length of MTs, can modulate MTOC positioning, as observed in the experiments. Overall, our results show that actin networks can limit the sensitivity of MTOC positioning to MT length and enforce robust MTOC centering or decentering depending on its architecture.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,10.1101/2022.01.21.476947,Microtubules,NA,

Most trials had potential for selection, performance, detection, and selective reporting bias. No trial blinded participants. We present the results separately for asymptomatic (healthy children) and symptomatic (children with JIA) flat feet. The certainty of evidence was very low to low, downgraded for bias, imprecision, and indirectness. Three comparisons were evaluated across trials: CFO versus shoes; PFO versus shoes; CFO versus PFO. Asymptomatic flat feet 1.  CFOs versus shoes  (1 trial, 106 participants): low‐quality evidence showed that CFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10‐point visual analogue scale (VAS)) at one year (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.07); absolute decrease (11.8%, 95% CI 4.7% fewer to 15.8% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19); absolute effect (3.4% more, 95% CI 4.1% fewer to 13.1% more). 2.  PFOs versus shoes  (1 trial, 106 participants): low to very‐low quality evidence showed that PFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10‐point VAS) at one year (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.16); absolute effect (4.7% fewer, 95% CI 18.9% fewer to 12.6% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23). 3.  CFOs versus PFOs  (1 trial, 108 participants): low‐quality evidence found no difference in the proportion without pain at one year (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18); absolute effect (7.4% fewer, 95% CI 22.2% fewer to 11.1% more); or on withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.12). Function and quality of life (QoL) were not assessed. Symptomatic (JIA) flat feet 1.  CFOs versus shoes  (1 trial, 28 participants, 3‐month follow‐up): very low‐quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain (0 to 10 scale, 0 no pain) between groups (MD ‐1.5, 95% CI ‐2.78 to ‐0.22). Low‐quality evidence showed improvements in function with CFOs (Foot Function Index ‐ FFI disability, 0 to 100, 0 best function; MD ‐18.55, 95% CI ‐34.42 to ‐2.68), child‐rated QoL (PedsQL, 0 to 100, 100 best quality; MD 12.1, 95% CI ‐1.6 to 25.8) and parent‐rated QoL (PedsQL MD 9, 95% CI ‐4.1 to 22.1) and little or no difference between groups in treatment success (timed walking; MD ‐1.33 seconds, 95% CI ‐2.77 to 0.11), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.94); absolute difference (9.7% fewer, 20.5 % fewer to 44.8% more). 2.  PFOs versus shoes  (1 trial, 25 participants, 3‐month follow‐up): very low‐quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain between groups (MD 0.02, 95% CI ‐1.94 to 1.98). Low‐quality evidence showed no difference between groups in function (FFI‐disability MD ‐4.17, 95% CI ‐24.4 to 16.06), child‐rated QoL (PedsQL MD ‐3.84, 95% CI ‐19 to 11.33), or parent‐rated QoL (PedsQL MD ‐0.64, 95% CI ‐13.22 to 11.94). 3.  CFOs versus PFOs  (2 trials, 87 participants): low‐quality evidence showed little or no difference between groups in pain (0 to 10 scale, 0 no pain) at 3 months (MD ‐1.48, 95% CI ‐3.23 to 0.26), function (FFI‐disability MD ‐7.28, 95% CI ‐15.47 to 0.92), child‐rated QoL (PedsQL MD 8.6, 95% CI ‐3.9 to 21.2), or parent‐rated QoL (PedsQL MD 2.9, 95% CI ‐11 to 16.8). Authors' conclusions Low to very low‐certainty evidence shows that the effect of CFOs (high cost) or PFOs (low cost) versus shoes, and CFOs versus PFOs on pain, function and HRQoL is uncertain. This is pertinent for clinical practice, given the economic disparity between CFOs and PFOs. FOs may improve pain and function, versus shoes in children with JIA, with minimal delineation between costly CFOs and generic PFOs. This review updates that from 2010, confirming that in the absence of pain, the use of high‐cost CFOs for healthy children with flexible flat feet has no supporting evidence, and draws very limited conclusions about FOs for treating paediatric flat feet. The availability of normative and prospective foot development data, dismisses most flat foot concerns, and negates continued attention to this topic. Attention should be re‐directed to relevant paediatric foot conditions, which cause pain, limit function, or reduce quality of life. The agenda for researching asymptomatic flat feet in healthy children must be relegated to history, and replaced by a targeted research rationale, addressing children with indisputable foot pathology from discrete diagnoses, namely JIA, cerebral palsy, congenital talipes equino varus, trisomy 21 and Charcot Marie Tooth. Whether research resources should continue to be wasted on studying flat feet in healthy children that do not hurt, is questionable. Future updates of this review will address only relevant paediatric foot conditions. Plain language summary Foot orthoses for treating flat feet in children Review question What are the benefits and harms of using foot orthoses (shoe inserts) to treat flat feet in children? Background Children with flat feet have a lower foot arch. When the child is standing, the foot arch looks flat against the floor, and may roll inwards, and even touch the floor. Sometimes, flat feet can cause pain, or change the way a child walks. There are many types of non‐surgical treatments for flat feet, but unless painful, most children do not need any treatment. Foot orthoses (FOs) or shoe inserts, muscle stretching, footwear selection, physical activity modification, and reducing body weight, may be part of an overall foot and activity management. The short‐term use of medication for pain and inflammation may be prescribed. Study characteristics This Cochrane Review is current to September 2021. There are 16 studies (1058 children, aged 11 months to 19 years) including three groups ‐ healthy children with painless flat feet; children with arthritis and painful flat feet; others (developmental coordination disorder; painful flat feet). The studies were conducted across the USA, Australia, India, Iran, Turkey, UK, and Republic of Korea. We found information about footwear, exercises, and different types of foot orthoses. Results: Comparing custom foot orthoses  ( CFOs) to shoes in painless flat feet: Proportion without pain (1 trial, 106 children) at 12 months: 12% fewer children with CFOs were without pain (ranging from 26% fewer to 5.5% more) 67 out of 100 children were without pain with CFOs compared to 79 children out of 100 with shoes. Withdrawal due to side effects (3 trials, 211 children): 3% more children with CFOs withdrew from treatment due to side effects (ranging from 4% fewer to 13% more) . 72 out of 100 children withdrew from treatment with CFOs compared with 69 children out of 100 with shoes. Comparing prefabricated foot orthoses (PFOs) to shoes in painless flat feet Proportion without pain (1 trial, 106 children) at 12 months: 5% fewer children with PFOs were without pain (ranging from 18.9% fewer to 12.6% more) 74 out of 100 children were without pain with PFOs compared to 79 out of 100 children with shoes. Withdrawal due to side effects (4 trials, 338 children): 0.7% fewer children with PFOs withdrew from treatment due to side effects (ranging from 15.2% fewer to 16.6% more). 71 out of 100 children withdrew from treatment with PFOs compared with 72 out of 100 children with shoes. Comparing CFOs to PFOs in painless flat feet Proportion without pain (1 trial, 106 children) at 12 months: 7% fewer children with CFOs were without pain (ranging from 22.2% fewer to 11.1% more) 68 out of 100 children were without pain with CFOs compared to 74 out of 100 children with PFOs. Withdrawal due to side effects (1 trial, 118 children): 0% fewer children withdrew from treatment with CFOs due to side effects (ranging from 9.2% fewer to 11% more). 91 out of 100 children withdrew from treatment with CFOs compared with 91 out of 100 children with PFOs. Function, quality of life, treatment success and side effects were not reported in these trials Quality of the evidence In healthy children with painless flat feet, low to very low‐quality evidence shows that compared to shoes, CFOs and PFOs result in no difference in the proportion without pain or withdrawal due to side effects from treatment. The quality of the evidence is very low to low, weakening conclusions. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because the trials were poorly conducted and there were not enough data.",[Musculoskeletal],10.1002/14651858.CD006311.pub4,*Flatfoot [therapy];*Foot Orthoses;Child;Humans;Pain;Pain Measurement;Quality of Life;Orthotic Devices;Foot Orthoses;Foot,NA,

Abdominal pain is the most prevalent clinical manifestation. Other people may have no symptoms or experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or blood in their stools. For people with SIDSMA who are not suspected of intestinal necrosis or intra‐abdominal bleeding, medical treatment and endovascular therapy are the main treatment options. There is no consensus on the optimum first‐line management strategy. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of endovascular therapy versus medical treatment for spontaneous isolated dissection of the superior mesenteric artery (SIDSMA). Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 3 August 2021. Selection criteria We planned to include all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared endovascular therapy and medical treatments for SIDSMA. We planned to exclude studies where participants were treated with open surgery. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were endovascular intervention rate and recurrent abdominal pain. Our secondary outcomes were open surgery rate, remodeling rate of SMA, new aneurysm formation of SMA, SMA occlusion, new dissection of SMA, death, symptom relief rate and complications of endovascular therapy. We planned to use GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. Main results We did not identify any RCTs to include in any analysis. Authors' conclusions We were not able to include any RCTs that compared endovascular therapy versus medical treatment in people with SIDSMA. High‐quality RCTs that evaluate the benefits and harms of these interventions are needed to help determine the optimal strategy for managing SIDSMA. Plain language summary Endovascular therapy versus medical treatment for spontaneous isolated dissection of the superior mesenteric artery Key message There is not enough evidence to compare the benefits and harms of the two main options for treating people with spontaneous dissection of the mesenteric artery (SIDSMA). Why is this question important? Blood vessels are made up of different layers. If one of these layers rips or ruptures, blood can flow between the layers, pushing the layers apart and creating two channels for the blood to flow through, which stops the blood from delivering oxygen and nutrients. A spontaneous isolated dissection of the superior mesenteric artery (SIDSMA) occurs after a rupture in one of the main blood vessels in the abdomen (stomach area), called the superior mesenteric artery, happens for no clear reason and not in any other main vessels. People may not show any symptoms, or they may have abdominal pain, feel sick, vomit, have diarrhea or blood in their stools. There are two main treatment options for people with SIDSMA. The first is medical treatment, where people are given nutrients through a line straight into the blood. This means the stomach and intestines (where food is digested) do not need as much blood. This gives the ruptured vessels time to recover. The second option is endovascular therapy, where a small incision is made in the groin area or in the elbow pit and a small tube (stent) is placed into the blood vessel to seal the rupture and restore normal blood flow. Medical treatment is not always successful and the stent may not continue to maintain normal blood flow for a long time after endovascular therapy. It is important to know about the benefits and harms of both of these options so that doctors and people with SIDSMA can make the best decision about treatment. What did we do? We searched the literature for randomized controlled trials which compared endovascular therapy with medical treatment for managing SIDSMA. In randomized controlled trials the treatments people receive are decided at random, and these give the most reliable evidence about treatment effects. What did we find? We did not find any studies comparing endovascular therapy with medical treatment. How certain are we with the evidence? There is a lack of evidence to help answer this question. High‐quality studies are needed to help inform the best treatment options. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is current to 3 August 2021.",[Vascular],10.1002/14651858.CD014703.pub2,"*Endovascular Procedures [methods];Abdominal Pain [etiology, therapy];Humans;Mesenteric Artery, Superior [surgery];Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Treatment Outcome;Mesenteric Arteries;Mesenteric Artery, Superior",NA,

This review aimed to investigate PFA training's efficacy in the existing studies and evaluate these programs' impact on trainees.     METHODS: MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD), EMBASE (Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands), PsycInfo (American Psychological Association, Washington, DC), and Cochrane Library (John Wiley & Sons, Hobken, NJ, USA) were searched on August 1, 2020 without language and date limitation. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) (Cochrane, London, UK) were used to assess the quality of the studies included. SPSS (IBM Corp., Endicott, NY, USA) was used for descriptive, comparative, and correlational summaries.     RESULTS: From 376 articles, only 9 studies met the criteria and were included after screening. The most common outcome was knowledge improvement, followed by increased confidence, and competence. Other outcomes encompassed Attitude, preparedness, and therapeutic engagement.     CONCLUSION: PFA is the most suggested early intervention aftermath and could be acquired by professionals and non-professionals in the mental health area. Nonetheless, to obtain the desired outcome, PFA training programs' quality is vital. This review revealed that most training programs' duration was short, without scenario-based interactions and post-training supervisions. More controlled trials are required to measure the effectiveness of PFA training on the providers.",,10.1017/dmp.2022.27,Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome,NA,

Therefore, in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the effects of PFAS on female fertility based on population evidence.     METHODS: Electronic searches of the Web of Science, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were conducted (from inception to March 2022) to collect observational studies related to PFAS and female fertility. Two evaluators independently screened the literature, extracted information and evaluated the risk of bias for the included studies, meta-analysis was performed using R software.     RESULTS: A total of 5468 records were searched and 13 articles fully met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was negatively associated with the female fecundability odds ratio (FOR = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (Cl) [0.78; 0.98]) and positively associated with the odds ratio for infertility (OR = 1.33, 95%Cl [1.03; 1.73]). Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure was negatively associated with the fecundability odds ratio (FOR = 0.94, 95% CI [0.90; 0.98]). Pooled effect values for perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) exposure did not find sufficient evidence for an association with female fertility.     CONCLUSION: Based on the evidence provided by the current study, increased levels of PFAS exposure are associated with reduced fertility in women, this was characterized by a reduction in fecundability odds ratio and an increase in odds ratio for infertility. This finding could partially explain the decline in female fertility and provide insight into risk assessment when manufacturing products containing PFAS.",,10.1016/j.envres.2022.114718,Fertilizers;Fertility;Self-Fertilization,NA,

Individuals with lower extremity amputations or congenital lower limb deficiency are encouraged to participate in para-sports. However, to compete in Paralympic sports, the candidate must have an impairment that results in lower extremity loss of function and meets or exceeds the sport's minimum impairment criteria (MIC). This review will focus on the MIC for competitive wheelchair tennis. Limb deficiency is known as one of the MIC used to regulate participation in competitive para-sports since it impacts gait, kinematics, and biomechanics of both the upper and lower body. Notwithstanding, it is questionable whether the MIC concerning limb deficiency is set at the correct level for determining eligibility for participating in Paralympic sports. This study aims to provide an overview of the evidence examining the impact of different partial foot amputation (PFA) levels on gait as a proxy for sporting performance. This scoping review will be based on a 6-step methodological framework and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis, extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Studies will be selected from PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus. Two authors will screen the titles/abstracts independently. Selected studies will be scrutinised, and the same authors will extract data. Findings will be relevant to informing the evidence-based development of MIC for lower limb impairment after PFA and may be extrapolated to specific Paralympic sports, including wheelchair tennis.

Nurses and healthcare workers in care homes have been particularly impacted due to rapid and dramatic changes to their job roles, workloads, and working environments, and residents' multimorbidity. Developed by the World Health Organisation, Psychological First Aid (PFA) is a brief training course delivering social, emotional, supportive, and pragmatic support that can reduce the initial distress after disaster and foster future adaptive functioning.     OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to synthesise findings from studies exploring the usefulness of PFA for the well-being of nursing and residential care home staff.     METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across 15 databases (Social Care Online, Kings Fund Library, Prospero, Dynamed, BMJ Best Practice, SIGN, NICE, Ovid, Proquest, Campbell Library, Clinical Trials, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Ebsco CINAHL, and Cochrane Library), identifying peer-reviewed articles published in English language from database inception to 20th June 2021.     RESULTS: Of the 1,159 articles screened, 1,146 were excluded at title and abstract; the remaining 13 articles were screened at full text, all of which were then excluded.     CONCLUSION: This review highlights that empirical evidence of the impact of PFA on the well-being of nursing and residential care home staff is absent. PFA has likely been recommended to healthcare staff during the Covid-19 pandemic. The lack of evidence found here reinforces the urgent need to conduct studies which evaluates the outcomes of PFA particularly in the care home staff population.",,10.1186/s12912-022-00866-6,"Nursing Homes;Nurses, Community Health",NA,

Regarding the complications of PFAs, few studies have investigated periprosthetic fractures. The purpose of this literature review was to highlight a previously overlooked complication of primary prosthetic surgery of the patellofemoral joint.     METHODS: Three literature databases were searched for studies published between 2000 to 2020 using relevant keywords. A total of 4,942 articles were originally identified. After excluding duplicates and analysing the titles and abstracts, 20 studies were considered. From these, data regarding the number of cases, clinical outcomes and complications were extracted.     RESULTS: Among the 20 selected articles, only one described periprosthetic fractures as a complication of PFAs. Herein, we also report an illustrative case of an unknown fracture complication. No cases in the literature were found that described the type of complications experienced by our patient during the postoperative period.     CONCLUSIONS: This review confirms the lack of data about clinical outcomes and fracture complications of PFAs. In primary prosthetic surgery of the patellofemoral joint, patient selection and close consideration of demographic factors (such as BMI and age) and intraoperative factors (such as patellar thickness and size of the trochlear component) play a key role in optimising pre-operative planning to avoid intraoperative periprosthetic fractures.",,10.1177/21514593221138662,Arthroplasty,NA,

METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the authors searched the PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Ovid databases for studies on recurrent infratentorial ependymomas in patients younger than 25 years of age. Exclusion criteria included case series of fewer than 5 patients and studies that did not provide time-dependent survival data.     RESULTS: The authors' database search yielded 482 unique articles, of which 18 were included in the final analysis. There were 479 recurrent infratentorial pediatric ependymomas reported; 53.4% were WHO grade II and 46.6% were WHO grade III tumors. The overall mortality for recurrent infratentorial pediatric ependymomas was 49.1% (226/460). The pooled mean survival was 30.2 months after recurrence (95% CI 22.4-38.0 months).

The reported concentrations ranged over many orders of magnitude, from ng/L to mg/L levels. Distinct differences in concentration ranges were observed between sites located within or near sources versus those that are not. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), ranging from <0.03 ng/L to ~7 mg/L, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), ranging from 0.01 ng/L to ~5 mg/L, were the two most reported PFAS. The highest PFAS concentration in groundwater was ~15 mg/L reported for the replacement-PFAS 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS). Maximum reported groundwater concentrations for PFOA and PFOS were compared to concentrations reported for soils, surface waters, marine waters, and precipitation. Soil concentrations are generally significantly higher than those reported for the other media. This accrues to soil being the primary entry point for PFAS release into the environment for many sites, as well as the generally significantly greater retention capacity of soil compared to the other media. The presence of PFAS has been reported for all media in all regions tested including areas that are far removed from specific PFAS sources. This gives rise to the existence of a ""background"" concentration of PFAS that must be accounted for in both regional and site-specific risk assessments. The presence of this background is a reflection of the large-scale use of PFAS, their general recalcitrance, and the action of long-range transport processes that distribute PFAS across regional and global scales. This ubiquitous distribution has the potential to significantly impact the quality and availability of water resources in many regions. In addition, the pervasive presence of PFAS in the environment engenders concerns for impacts to ecosystem and human health.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156602,,NA,

This systematic review assessed PFA efficacy in improving the mental health and psychosocial well-being of individuals exposed to potentially traumatic events. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, PTSDpubs, and EMBASE for peer reviewed studies evaluating programmatic outcomes of PFA, or an adapted intervention, published in English before March 9, 2021. Studies evaluating training outcomes or program feasibility were excluded. The primary outcomes were reported measures of participant mental health and psychosocial well-being, with narrative results presented for each. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was applied. Of 9,048 potentially eligible citations, 12 studies with a total of 1,437 participants met the inclusion criteria. Only one study was a randomized controlled trial. The findings from all studies suggest a positive impact of PFA, with most reporting reduced symptoms of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, and distress, as well as improved ratings of mood, the experience of safety, connectedness, and a sense of control, among youth and adults. Risk of bias was generally high. Inconsistent intervention components, insufficient evaluation methodologies, and a high risk of bias within the reviewed studies present challenges in assessing PFA efficacy, and an imbalance between popular support for PFA and scant evidence of outcome data exists. Further research is needed to justify the proliferation of PFA.",,10.1002/jts.22888,Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome,NA,

We investigated cross-sectional associations between PFAS and body mass index (BMI) in teenagers/adolescents across nine European countries within the Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) initiative. We used data from 1957 teenagers (12-18 yrs) that were part of the HBM4EU aligned studies, consisting of nine HBM studies (NEBII, Norway; Riksmaten Adolescents 2016-17, Sweden; PCB cohort (follow-up), Slovakia; SLO CRP, Slovenia; CROME, Greece; BEA, Spain; ESTEBAN, France; FLEHS IV, Belgium; GerES V-sub, Germany). Twelve PFAS were measured in blood, whilst weight and height were measured by field nurse/physician or self-reported in questionnaires. We assessed associations between PFAS and age- and sex-adjusted BMI z-scores using linear and logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders. Random-effects meta-analysis and mixed effects models were used to pool studies. We assessed mixture effects using molar sums of exposure biomarkers with toxicological/structural similarities and quantile g-computation. In all studies, the highest concentrations of PFAS were PFOS (medians ranging from 1.34 to 2.79 μg/L). There was a tendency for negative associations with BMI z-scores for all PFAS (except for PFHxS and PFHpS), which was borderline significant for the molar sum of [PFOA and PFNA] and significant for single PFOA [β-coefficient (95% CI) per interquartile range fold change = -0.06 (-0.17, 0.00) and -0.08 (-0.15, -0.01), respectively]. Mixture assessment indicated similar negative associations of the total mixture of [PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOS] with BMI z-score, but not all compounds showed associations in the same direction: whilst [PFOA, PFNA and PFOS] were negatively associated, [PFHxS] associated positively with BMI z-score. Our results indicated a tendency for associations of relatively low PFAS concentrations with lower BMI in European teenagers.

However, in carefully selected cohorts, PFA continues to be an appropriate treatment option for end-stage isolated patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis. In the later situation whereby a PFA is considered for conversion to a TKA - often due to disease progression - uncertainty remains regarding optimal management of the in situ patellar button. This review of the contemporary literature aimed to provide a summary of the current evidence to support surgeon decision-making, by evaluating the compatibility, efficacy, and survivorship of retained versus revised patellar buttons in PFA-to-TKA conversion. Specific focus was paid to implant design and technical considerations during revision, plus post-operative patient-reported outcomes and modes of secondary patellar component failure.     METHODS: A review of the Embase, Cochrane and PubMed databases was performed following PRISMA search principles.     RESULTS: This investigation highlights that the fate of patellar buttons in PFA-to-TKA conversion has previously been poorly studied, with scant publication data available. Most reports have been of singular cases or small cohort series. Larger formal RCTs and level 1 evidence are lacking.     CONCLUSION: The findings herein suggest that surgeons can confidently retain well-fixed, undamaged, dome-shaped all-polyethylene patellar buttons in the conversion of a PFA to TKA with the expectation of acceptable mid-term performance and survivorship, as long as congruent tracking with the new tibiofemoral components is achieved. This result is likely translatable to the majority of contemporary, all-polyethylene, dome-shaped patellar buttons, even with manufacturer mismatch.",,10.1177/10225536221084147,Knee,NA,

The issues of species differences between humans and rodents, the animal ethical concerns and the time and cost required for neurotoxicity studies on in vivo animal models, do limit the use of animal-based models in neurotoxicology. In this context, human cell models appear relevant in elucidating cellular and molecular impacts of neurotoxicants and facilitating prioritization of in vivo testing. The SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line (ATCC® CRL-2266™) is one of the most used cell lines in neurosciences, either undifferentiated or differentiated into neuron-like cells. This review presents the characteristics of the SH-SY5Y cell line and proposes the results of a systematic review of literature on the use of this in vitro cell model for neurotoxicity research by focusing on organic environmental pollutants including pesticides, 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), flame retardants, PFASs, parabens, bisphenols, phthalates, and PAHs. Organic environmental pollutants are widely present in the environment and increasingly known to cause clinical neurotoxic effects during fetal & child development and adulthood. Their effects on cultured SH-SY5Y cells include autophagy, cell death (apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis, or necrosis), increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of neurotransmitter homeostasis, and alteration of neuritic length.

METHODS: We conducted a pooled analysis of two large studies of PFOA and renal cell carcinoma (RCC, the most common type of kidney cancer); one from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (324 cases and controls), and a second from the C8 Science Panel (103 cases and 511 controls). Serum PFOA levels were estimated a median of 8 years before diagnosis. Analyses were conducted via conditional logistic regression. Lifetime risk of kidney cancer per unit serum PFOA concentration and per unit dose were calculated. RESULTS: The 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of serum PFOA levels were 4.8, 7.3, and 23.9 ng/ml for the pooled analysis. The preferred model for the pooled datawas a two-piece linear spline model (knot at 12.5 ng/ml serum PFOA); the log odds of RCC increased 0.1349 per 1 ng/ml increase in serum PFOA up to the knot (eg, an OR of 2.02 (1.45-2.80) from the median to the knot), and was flat thereafter. The estimated lifetime excess risk (cancer slope factor) with an exposure of 1 ng/ml was 0.0018, similar to the excess risk of 0.0026 recently reported by CalEPA based on different methods. Assuming a serum half-life of 2.3 years and a distribution volume of 170 ml/kg for PFOA, our results are equivalent to 0.0128 per ng/kg/d of PFOA intake. To limit excess lifetime kidney cancer risk to 1/1,000,000, our data suggest a limit of 0.0015 ng/L (0.0015 ppt) for PFOA in drinking water, similar to CalEPA's proposed Public Health Goal and the new US EPA Drinking Water Health Advisory.

Although attention to effects of exposure to mixtures of PFAS has grown in recent years, there is no consensus on the appropriate statistical methods that can be used to assess their combined effect on human health. OBJECTIVES: We aim to perform a comprehensive review of the statistical methods used in the existing studies which evaluate the association between exposure to mixtures of PFAS and any adverse human health effect. METHODS: The online databases PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched for eligible studies, published during the last ten years (last search performed on April 08, 2021). Covidence software was used by two different reviewers to perform a title/abstract screening, followed by a full text revision of the selected papers. RESULTS: A total of 3640 papers were identified, and after the screening process, 53 papers were included in the current review. Most of the studies were published between 2019 and 2021 and were conducted mainly in North America and Europe; more than half of the studies (28 out of 53) were conducted on mother and child pairs. WQS (Weighted Quantile Sum) Regression and BKMR (Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression) were used in 36 out of 53 papers to model mixtures' effects.

CONCLUSION: Studies on human exposure to PFAS as complex mixtures and health consequences have substantially increased in the last few years.

Here we performed transcriptomic analyses in the mouse to investigate the molecular mechanisms of hepatic toxicity in the dam and its fetus after exposure to two different PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and its replacement, hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO-DA, known as GenX). Pregnant CD-1 mice were exposed via oral gavage from embryonic day (E) 1.5–17.5 to PFOA (0, 1, or 5 mg/kg-d) or GenX (0, 2, or 10 mg/kg-d). Maternal and fetal liver RNA was isolated (N = 5 per dose/group) and the transcriptome analyzed by Affymetrix Array. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) and differentially enriched pathways (DEP) were obtained. DEG patterns were similar in maternal liver for 5 mg/kg PFOA, 2 mg/kg GenX, and 10 mg/kg GenX (R2: 0.46–0.66). DEG patterns were similar across all 4 dose groups in fetal liver (R2: 0.59–0.81). There were more DEGs in fetal liver compared to maternal liver at the low doses for both PFOA (fetal = 69, maternal = 8) and GenX (fetal = 154, maternal = 93). Upregulated DEPs identified across all groups included Fatty Acid Metabolism, Peroxisome, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Adipogenesis, and Bile Acid Metabolism. Transcriptome-phenotype correlation analyses demonstrated &gt; 1000 maternal liver DEGs were significantly correlated with maternal relative liver weight (R2 &gt;0.92). These findings show shared biological pathways of liver toxicity for PFOA and GenX in maternal and fetal livers in CD-1 mice. The limited overlap in specific DEGs between the dam and fetus suggests the developing liver responds differently than the adult liver to these chemical stressors. This work helps define mechanisms of hepatic toxicity of two structurally unique PFAS and may help predict latent consequences of developmental exposure. © 2022",,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.114314,Mice;Pregnancy,NA,

Immobilised microorganisms were introduced to further advance microbial technology. In immobilisation technology, carrier materials distribute a large number of microorganisms evenly on their surface or inside and protect them from external interference to better treat the targets, thus effectively improving their bioavailability. Although many carrier materials have been developed, there have been relatively few comprehensive reviews. Therefore, this paper summarises the types of carrier materials explored in the last ten years from the perspective of structure, microbial activity, and cost. Among these, carbon materials and biofilms, as environmentally friendly functional materials, have been widely applied for immobilisation because of their abundant sources and favorable growth conditions for microorganisms. The novel covalent organic framework (COF) could also be a new immobilisation material, due to its easy preparation and high performance. Different immobilisation methods were used to determine the relationship between carriers and microorganisms. Co-immobilisation is particularly important because it can compensate for the deficiencies of a single immobilisation method. This paper emphasises that impact conditions also affect the immobilisation effect and function. In addition to temperature and pH, the media conditions during the preparation and reaction of materials also play a role. Additionally, this study mainly reviews the applications and mechanisms of immobilised microorganisms in environmental remediation. Future development of immobilisation technology should focus on the discovery of novel and environmentally friendly carrier materials, as well as the establishment of optimal immobilisation conditions for microorganisms. This review intends to provide references for the development of immobilisation technology in environmental applications and to further the improve understanding of immobilisation technology. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120232,,NA,

CO2, being a major component of greenhouse gases, draws more attention towards carbon capture and utilization (CCU) into energy rich products. Among all the CCU products, higher hydrocarbons, alcohols, and ethers are more desirable than low carbon-based products due to their featuring high energy density and minimal emissions. In this context, major advancements are being achieved in the production of fuels and fuel additives like ethanol, ethylene, ethane, dimethyl ether, light olefins (C2–C4 olefins), jet fuels (C8–C16 alkanes and cycloalkanes), aromatic products, etc. from CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Hence, it is imperative to compile and analyze its important features regarding catalyst environment, mechanistic insights, conversion efficiency, product selectivity and so on from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. In our review, we comprehensively evaluate the developments towards promoting CO2 hydrogenation to high carbon-based products. We intend to present the possible schemes, current challenges, and the expected future research pathways towards designing efficient catalytic systems for CO2 reduction reaction.

Exposure to PFOS may alter gut microbiota and liver metabolic homeostasis in mammals, thereby increasing the risk of cardiometabolic diseases. Diets high in soluble fibers can ameliorate metabolic disease risks. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test the hypothesis that soluble fibers (inulin or pectin) could modulate the adverse metabolic effects of PFOS by affecting microbe-liver metabolism and interactions. METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed an isocaloric diet containing different fibers: a) inulin (soluble), b) pectin (soluble), or c) cellulose (control, insoluble). The mice were exposed to PFOS in drinking water (3 lg=g per day) for 7 wk. Multi-omics was used to analyze mouse liver and cecum contents. RESULTS: In PFOS-exposed mice, the number of differentially expressed genes associated with atherogenesis and hepatic hyperlipidemia were lower in those that were fed soluble fiber than those fed insoluble fiber. Shotgun metagenomics showed that inulin and pectin protected against differences in microbiome community in PFOS-exposed vs. control mice. It was found that the plasma PFOS levels were lower in inulin-fed mice, and there was a trend of lower liver accumulation of PFOS in soluble fiber-fed mice compared with the control group. Soluble fiber intake ameliorated the effects of PFOS on host hepatic metabolism gene expression and cecal content microbiome structure. DISCUSSIONS: Results from metabolomic, lipidomic, and transcriptomic studies suggest that inulin-and pectin-fed mice were less susceptible to PFOS-induced liver metabolic disturbance, hepatic lipid accumulation, and transcriptional changes compared with control diet-fed mice. Our study advances the understanding of interaction between microbes and host under the influences of environmental pollutants and nutrients. The results provide new insights into the microbe-liver metabolic network and the protection against environmental pollutant-induced metabolic diseases by high-fiber diets. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11360. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The study of fetal signals poses specific challenges. Metabolomic analysis of maternal blood, the cord artery (CA), and cord vein (CV), allows simultaneous interrogation of multiple metabolic pathways associated with different modes of labour onset and birth. Methods: Global mass spectrometry metabolomics analysis was performed on serial samples collected from participants during pregnancy, in latent phase of labour, and following birth (CA, CV, and intervillous (IV) blood), from those who spontaneously laboured and birthed vaginally (SL group), had IOL and birthed vaginally (IOL group), or birthed via elective caesarean section (no labour; ECS group). Results: There were clear differences in fetal and maternal steroid, arachidonate and sphingosine pathways between the SL and IOL groups, despite similar uterine contractions and vaginal birth. The CA/CV ratio for key steroids of the IOL group were more alike the ECS group than the SL group, including progesterone (CA/CV ratio for: SL group=3.5; IOL group=0.5; and ECS group=0.5), and oestriol (CA/CV ratio for: SL group=4.3; IOL group=0.4; and for ECS group=0.2). There were no such changes in the maternal samples. Discussion: These findings indicate that IOL does not reproduce the pathways activated in spontaneous labour. The decreased placental progesterone production observed with spontaneous labour may represent a local intrauterine progesterone withdrawal, which, together with other signals, would activate parturition pathways involving arachidonate and sphingosine metabolism. © 2022 The Authors",,10.1016/j.placenta.2022.10.005,,NA,

Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature review was performed using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from date of inception to June 2022. Studies were selected based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Simultaneously, a retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent neurosurgical evaluation of suspected PEPA at our institution. Results: Of the 321 articles in the original literature search, 62 were selected. A total of 143 patients (93 men, 27 women; mean age, 70.7 years) diagnosed with PEPA were included. Mean time from carotid endarterectomy to PA diagnosis was 41.8 months. Primary repair data were available for 135 patients, including 19 with primary closures, 112 with patch or graft repairs, and 4 with eversion procedures. Fifty-five patients with PA (39%) presented with infection. Staphylococcal species were the most common causative organism. Of infected PAs, 89.1% were treated with open procedures. Overall complication rates of PAs treated via open, endovascular, and hybrid methods were 31%, 15.4%, and 0%, respectively. Open ligation (42.9%) and aneurysmectomy with grafting (36.4%) resulted in the highest rates of complications. Conclusions: Despite higher complication rates after open repair strategies, use of these techniques remains a viable option in situations requiring removal of infected patches or evacuation of large extravascular collections. Endovascular treatment options are associated with low numbers of complications and can be considered for primary PEPA treatment when infection is not present. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.wneu.2022.08.124,"Endarterectomy, Carotid;Carotid Artery Injuries;Endarterectomy",NA,

However, undesired side effects, unsatisfactory response rates, tumor metastasis, and drug resistance still hinder the further application of ICB therapy against CRC. Advancing ICB with nanotechnology can be game-changing. With the development of immuno-oncology and nanomaterials, various nanoplatforms have been fabricated to enhance the efficacy of ICB in CRC treatment. Herein, this review systematically summarizes these recent nano-strategies according to their mechanisms. Despite their diverse and complex designs, these nanoplatforms have four main mechanisms in enhancing ICB: 1) targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to tumor foci, 2) increasing tumor immunogenicity, 3) remodeling tumor microenvironment, and 4) pre-sensitizing immune systems. Importantly, advantages of nanotechnology in CRC, such as innovating the mode-of-actions of ICB, modulating intestinal microbiome, and integrating the whole process of antigen presentation, are highlighted in this review. In general, this review describes the latest applications of nanotechnology for CRC immunotherapy, and may shed light on the future design of ICB platforms.

The synthetic dyes cause a number of environmental health hazards and promote toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity in humans. Despite these serious health glitches, synthetic dyes are widely used due to their much lower cost.

Short chain alkanes (C2-C8) have been well-known as inhibitors for nitrification through interaction with the ammonia monooxygenase, while whether these alkanes affect anammox is an open question. Here, this work demonstrated significant inhibition of ethane on anammox and revealed the inhibitory mechanism. The acute inhibition of ethane on anammox was concentration-dependent and reversible; 0.86 mM dissolved ethane caused 50% inhibition (IC50), and 1.72 mM ethane almost completely inhibited anammox. After long-term exposure to 0.09 mM ethane for 30 days, the ammonium (nitrite) removal rate dropped from 202 (267) mg N L-1 d-1 to 1 (1) mg N L-1 d-1, and the abundance of anammox bacteria decreased from 61.9% to 9.5%. The intercellular ammonium concentration of anammox bacteria decreased after ethane exposure, while metatranscriptome analysis showed significant upregulation of genes for ammonium transport of anammox bacteria. Thus, ethane could suppress ammonium uptake resulting in the inhibition of anammox activities. As ethane is the second most prevalent alkane after methane in various anoxic environments, ethane may have an important effect on the nitrogen cycle driven by anammox that should be investigated in future research. © 2022 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acs.est.2c01527,Acetaldehyde,NA,

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic evidence map (SEM) is to summarize the epidemiology evidence on approximately 150 lesser studied PFAS prioritized by the EPA for tiered toxicity testing, facilitating interpretation of those results as well as identification of priorities for risk assessment and data gaps for future research. METHODS: The Populations, Exposure, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were intentionally broad to identify studies of any health effects in humans with information on associations with exposure to the identified PFAS. Systematic review methods were used to search for literature that was screened using machine-learning software and manual review. Studies meeting the PECO criteria underwent quantitative data extraction and evaluation for risk of bias and sensitivity using the Integrated Risk Information System approach. RESULTS: 193 epidemiology studies were identified, which included information on 15 of the PFAS of interest. The most commonly studied health effect categories were metabolic (n = 37), endocrine (n = 30), cardiovascular (30), female reproductive (n = 27), developmental (n = 26), immune (n = 22), nervous (n = 21), male reproductive (n = 14), cancer (n = 12), and urinary (n = 11) effects. In study evaluation, 120 (62%) studies were con-sidered High/Medium confidence for at least one outcome. DISCUSSION: Most of the PFAS in this SEM have little to no epidemiology data available to inform evaluation of potential health effects. Although exposure to the 15 PFAS that had data was fairly low in most studies, these less-studied PFAS may be used as replacements for “legacy” PFAS, leading to potentially greater exposure. It is impractical to generate epidemiology evidence to fill the existing gaps for all potentially relevant PFAS. This SEM highlights some of the important research gaps that currently exist. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services. All rights reserved.",,10.1289/EHP11185,,NA,

Regulation of PFASs remains a big concern for society. Based on the knowledge that C-F is the strongest single bond in organic chemistry, PFASs are considered as high persistent substances by some scientists. Therefore, it is recommended that PFASs be managed as a highly persistent category and that all ‘nonessential’ uses of these chemicals should be phased out. In view of their wide application in various fields, involving huge socioeconomic impacts, accelerating the phase-out of PFASs is bound to have a huge impact on society and economy. It is therefore a long way to go in reaching consensus on PFASs management. As a result, phasing out PFASs requires a lengthy transition period. Currently, meaningful actions are needed to minimize the potential exposure risk of PFASs while meeting their social needs. In fact, there are approximately 5000 PFASs available on the global market. Studies indicate that the transformation behaviors of PFASs happen under different conditions, which result in various kinds of new emerging PFASs in natural environment and biota. There are limited data on the PBT properties of these new PFASs. Actually, some new PFASs are environmentally friendly themselves, but they can degrade to highly toxic and persistent PFASs such as PFOS, PFOA and PFHxS. These transformation products thereby become indirect sources of traditional PFASs in the environment, which would eventually lead to constant human exposure to these chemicals. Thus, it is very important to study the transformation of PFASs. Transformational studies can help identify transformational products with lower persistence and toxicity, which will provide valuable insights into the design of safer fluorinated alternatives. Here, for the first time, we propose that strengthening the study on the transformation of PFASs is an important strategy for classifying and managing fluorinated alternatives, and this will provide technical framework and support for the regulation of fluorinated alternatives. Furthermore, we make these proposals on the way forward for investigating transformational process of PFASs. Firstly, nontargeted and high-resolution mass spectrometry technologies must be continually developed, as these investigation methods are able to implement high throughput analysis of transformation products by assembling formulas and possible structures from molecular precursor and fragment data of existing PFASs. Secondly, the transmission, accumulation, metabolism, and elimination behaviors of PFASs in different matrices should be of high concern. In this regard, a combination of multi-omics, high-throughput toxicity testing, theory calculation, and machine learning is recommended to explor the potential mechanisms, and the essential factors affecting the process. Through this, the transformation products with PBT properties can be ascertained, prioritized, and managed. Lastly, biological networks elaborating the relationship between PFASs transformation products and adverse health effects should be established. The transformation products of PFASs may eventually pose adverse public health risks, which suggests that mapping a systematic transformation network would be beneficial to the classified management of fluorinated alternatives.

Without this knowledge, health-based consumption advisories can not be determined for consumers that include Tribes and First Nations, Asian and Pacific Islander community members, and recreational harvesters. We measured contaminant concentrations in edible seaweeds (Fucus distichus, F. spiralis, and Nereocystis luetkeana) from 43 locations in the Salish Sea. Metals were analyzed in all samples, and 94 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) (i.e. 40 PCBs, 15 PBDEs, 17 PCDD/Fs, and 22 organochlorine pesticides) and 51 PAHs were analyzed in Fucus spp. We compared concentrations of contaminants to human health-based screening levels calculated from the USEPA and to international limits. We then worked with six focal contaminants that either exceeded screening levels or international limits (Cd, total Hg, Pb, benzo[a]pyrene [BaP], and PCBs) or are of regional interest (total As). USEPA cancer-based screening levels were exceeded in 30 samples for the PCBs and two samples for BaP. Cadmium concentrations did not exceed the USEPA noncancer-based screening level but did exceed international limits at all sites. Lead exceeded international limits at three sites. Because there are no screening levels for total Hg and total As, and to be conservative, we made comparisons to methyl Hg and inorganic As screening levels. All samples were below the methyl Hg and above the inorganic As screening levels. Without knowledge of the As speciation, we cannot assess the health risk associated with the As. While seaweed was the focus, we did not consider contaminant exposure from consuming other foods. Other chemicals, such as contaminants of emerging concern (e.g., PFAS, pharmaceuticals and personal care products), should also be considered. Additionally, although we focused on toxicological aspects, there are cultural and health benefits of seaweed use that may affect consumer choice. © 2022 Hahn et al.

PFAS are stable and extremely resistant to degradation, resulting in high persistence throughout the environment as well as in human blood. PFAS consist of a large family of synthetic chemicals, with over 4000 distinct varieties having been identified and around 250 currently being manufactured at globally relevant levels. Numerous epidemiological studies have linked exposure to PFAS with adverse health effects ranging from immunotoxicity, cardiometabolic disease, developmental and reproductive effects, cancer, and recently type 2 diabetes. Several studies have demonstrated associations between serum PFAS concentrations and glycemic indicators of type 2 diabetes including glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR in adolescent and adult cohorts. In addition, some studies have shown positive associations with incident type 2 diabetes and multiple PFAS. However, the link between PFAS exposure and the development of diabetes continues to be a disputed area of study, with conflicting data having been reported from various epidemiological studies. In this mini review we will summarize the current state of the literature linking PFAS to type 2 diabetes and discuss important future directions including the use of more complex mixtures-based statistical analyses.

In stress periods, however, proteostasis and survival depend on the strongly conserved Clp/Hsp100 family. Currently, the targets of ATP-powered unfoldases/disaggregases ClpB and ClpX and of peptidase ClpP heptameric rings are still unclear. Trapping experiments and proteome profiling in multiple organisms triggered confusion, so we analyzed the consistency of ClpP-trap targets in bacteria. We also provide meta-analyses of protein interactions in humans, to elucidate where Clp family members are enriched. Furthermore, meta-analyses of mouse complexomics are provided. Genotype–phenotype correlations confirmed our concept. Trapping, proteome, and complexome data retrieved consistent coaccumulation of CLPXP with GFM1 and TUFM orthologs. CLPX shows broad interaction selectivity encompassing mitochondrial translation elongation, RNA granules, and nucleoids. CLPB preferentially attaches to mitochondrial RNA granules and translation initiation components; CLPP is enriched with them all and associates with release/recycling factors. Mutations in CLPP cause Perrault syndrome, with phenotypes similar to defects in mtDNA/mtRNA. Thus, we propose that CLPB and CLPXP are crucial to counteract misfolded insoluble protein assemblies that contain nucleotides. This insight is relevant to improve ClpP-modulating drugs that block bacterial growth and for the treatment of human infertility, deafness, and neurodegeneration. © 2022 by the authors.",,10.3390/cells11152370,Carrier Proteins,NA,

To compare the hepatotoxicity of H-PFMO2OSA with legacy perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), male adult mice were exposed to 0.2, 1, or 5 mg/kg/d of each chemical for 28 days. Results showed that, although H-PFMO2OSA liver and serum concentrations were lower than those of PFOS, the relative liver weight in the H-PFMO2OSA groups was significantly higher than that in the corresponding PFOS groups. In addition, the increase in alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase activity was greater in the H-PFMO2OSA groups than in the PFOS groups. Reduced glutathione (GSH) content and glutathione reductase activity in the liver increased in the 1 and 5 mg/kg/d H-PFMO2OSA groups and in the 5 mg/kg/d PFOS group. Liver quantitative proteome analysis demonstrated that, similar to PFOS, H-PFMO2OSA caused lipid metabolism disorder, and most lipid metabolism-related differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Additionally, KEGG enrichment analysis highlighted changes in the GSH metabolism pathway after PFOS and H-PFMO2OSA exposure. Then, there were eight DEPs involved in the GSH metabolism pathway that mostly were upregulated after exposure to H-PFMO2OSA but not after exposure to PFOS. In conclusion, H-PFMO2OSA induced higher levels of liver damage and more serious GSH metabolism dysregulation compared to PFOS. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Emerging findings suggest that non-communicable diseases are linked to early and chronic environmental exposures. However, the rapid globalisation in developing countries, environmental change and the emergence, spread, persistence and severity of infectious diseases are not yet well understood. The aim of this study is to understand which environmental toxicants are commonly associated with infectious diseases in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods and analysis A total of four electronic databases, MEDLINE through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) be searched to identify relevant studies and will be screened by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool for randomised control trials (RCTs) and ROB assessment tool for non-randomised studies for non-RCTs will be used to assess the ROB. A meta-analysis will be used to determine the pooled effect if we find out the included articles have similar environmental exposure, participant groups, study design and outcome measures. A narrative synthesis of the findings will be provided, along with summaries of the intervention effect. Heterogeneity between the studies will be assessed, and sensitivity analysis will be conducted based on study quality. Ethics and dissemination Findings will be summarised in a single manuscript. This review attempts to explore the pivotal role of environmental toxicants in predisposing, developing, persistent and severity of infectious diseases in LMICs. Findings from this study will highlight the effects of individual environmental toxicants' role on infectious disease outcomes for the early prevention and limit toxic exposure to guide individual, community, and occupational health policy for future strategies.

Methods: The Smith & Nephew InterTan IDL was compared with SL CMN group consisting of the Stryker Gamma-3 (G3) and Synthes Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA) CMN. A multi-database search was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Data from studies assessing the clinical and radiological outcomes, complications and perioperative parameters of InterTan versus G3 or PFNA CMN in patients with intertrochanteric femoral fractures were extracted and analysed. Results: 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis, consisting of 2643 patients. InterTan was associated with lower complication rates in terms of all-cause revisions (OR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22–0.51; p < 0.001), cut-outs (OR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.17–0.51; p < 0.001), medial or lateral screw migration (OR 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06–0.65; p = 0.008) as well as persistent hip and thigh pain (OR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47–0.90; p = 0.008). In terms of perioperative parameters, InterTan is associated with longer operative times (MD 5.57 minutes; 95% CI, 0.37–10.78 minutes, p = 0.04) and fluoroscopy times (MD 38.89 seconds, 95% CI, 15.88–61.91 seconds; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of clinical Harris Hip Score and radiological outcomes, non-union, haematoma, femoral fractures, varus collapse, length of stay and mean intraoperative blood loss between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Integrated dual lag screw cephalomedullary nails are associated with fewer revisions and complications.

Despite their abundance in AFFF, information is lacking on the potential transformation of these polyfluoroalkyl substances. Due to the biological and chemical stability of the repeating perfluoroalkyl -(CF2)n- moiety common to all known AFFF-derived PFASs, it is not immediately evident whether the microbial biotransformation mechanisms observed for other organic contaminants also govern the microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances. Herein, we aim to: 1) review the literature on the aerobic or anaerobic microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances in environmental media; 2) compile and summarize proposed microbial biotransformation pathways for major classes of polyfluoroalkyl substances; 3) identify the dominant biotransformation intermediates and terminal biotransformation products; and 4) discuss these findings in the context of environmental monitoring and source allocation. This analysis revealed that much more is currently known about aerobic microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances, as compared to anaerobic biotransformation. Further, there are some similarities in microbial biotransformations of fluorotelomer and electrochemical fluorination-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, but differences may be largely due to head group composition. Dealkylation, oxidation, and hydrolytic reactions appear to be particularly important for microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, and these biotransformations may lead to formation of some semi-stable intermediates. Finally, this review discusses key knowledge gaps and opportunities for further research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153711,Biotransformation,NA,

Little is known, however, about the prevalence of bacterial dechlorination in deep terrestrial environments with a limited carbon supply. In this study we analyzed published genomes from three deep terrestrial subsurface sites: a deep aquifer in Western Siberia, the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota, USA, and the Soudan Underground Iron Mine (SUIM) in Minnesota, USA to determine if there was evidence to suggest that microbial dehalogenation was possible in these environments. Diverse dehalogenase genes were present in all analyzed metagenomes, with reductive dehalogenase and haloalkane dehalogenase genes the most common. Taxonomic analysis of both hydrolytic and reductive dehalogenase genes was performed to explore their affiliation; this analysis indicated that at the SUIM site, hydrolytic dehalogenase genes were taxonomically affiliated with Marinobacter species. Because of this affiliation, experiments were also performed with Marinobacter subterrani strain JG233 ('JG233'), an organism containing three predicted hydrolytic dehalogenase genes and isolated from the SUIM site, to determine whether hydrolytic dehalogenation was an active process and involved in growth on a chlorocarboxylic acid. Presence of these genes in genome appears to be functional, as JG233 was capable of chloroacetate dechlorination with simultaneous chloride release. Stable isotope experiments combined with confocal Raman microspectroscopy demonstrated that JG233 incorporated carbon from 13C-chloroacetate into its biomass. These experiments suggest that organisms present in these extreme and often low-carbon environments are capable of reductive and hydrolytic dechlorination and, based on laboratory experiments, may use this capability as a competitive advantage by utilizing chlorinated organic compounds for growth, either directly or after dechlorination. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Methods: A recall-by-genotype study was implemented in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Samples from 756 participants were selected for untargeted metabolomics analysis based on low versus high genetic liability for higher BMI defined by a genetic risk score (GRS). Regression analyses were performed to investigate associations between BMI GRS group and relative abundance of 973 metabolites. Results: After correction for multiple testing, 29 metabolites were associated with BMI GRS group. Bilirubin was among the most strongly associated metabolites, with reduced levels measured in individuals in the high-BMI GRS group (β = −0.32, 95% CI: −0.46 to −0.18, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p = 0.005). This study observed associations between BMI GRS group and the levels of several potentially diet-related metabolites, including hippurate, which had lower mean abundance in individuals in the high-BMI GRS group (β = −0.29, 95% CI: −0.44 to −0.15, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p = 0.008). Conclusions: Together with existing literature, these results suggest that a genetic predisposition to higher BMI captures differences in metabolism leading to adiposity gain. In the absence of prospective data, separating these effects from the downstream consequences of weight gain is challenging. © 2022 The Authors.

Post-surgical imaging of mesh is useful when complications including mesh erosion, bleeding, and chronic pain arise. Different types of mesh coated with various materials have been developed to improve visibility on imaging studies. However, localization of surgical mesh after implantation remains challenging as visualization with standard imaging is difficult. The purpose of this study was to review the various radiologic approaches to characterizing synthetic surgical meshes. Recent Findings: A systematic and comprehensive literature search was performed by two independent reviewers using the PubMed database of the National Library of Medicine to identify all potentially relevant publications published before April 2020. Studies assessing the use of imaging for surgical mesh in both urogynecologic and non-urogyneocologic procedures were included. Iron impregnated mesh was most visible on imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Impregnated mesh was also shown to be more readily visible on ultrasound when compared to its non-iron containing counterpart. Non-impregnated expanded polytetrafluorethylene mesh (EPTF Mesh) was visible on CT and MRI. The more commonly used polypropylene and polyvinylidene mesh were more readily visualized on ultrasound although localization of surrounding structures remains difficult. Summary: Imaging surgical mesh poses an ongoing problem when complications arise. Although particle impregnated mesh is visible on CT and MRI, the adoption of this practice is still in its infancy. The ability to visualize EPTF mesh on CT and MRI is a promising advancement, but proper visualization of the more common synthetic meshes remains a limitation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s11884-022-00652-9,,NA,

These maps can provide an overview of available studies and relevant study information to be used for various research objectives and applications. Environmental epidemiological studies that examine the impact of chemical exposures on various ‘omic profiles in human populations provide relevant mechanistic information and can be used for benchmark dose modeling to derive potential human health reference values. Objectives: To create a systematic evidence map of environmental epidemiological studies examining environmental contaminant exposures with ‘omics in order to characterize the extent of available studies for future research needs. Methods: Systematic review methods were used to search and screen the literature and included the use of machine learning methods to facilitate screening studies. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were developed to identify and screen relevant studies. Studies that met the PECO criteria after full-text review were summarized with information such as study population, study design, sample size, exposure measurement, and ‘omics analysis. Results: Over 10,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes were used to identify 84 studies considered PECO-relevant after full-text review. Various contaminants (e.g. phthalate, benzene, arsenic, etc.) were investigated in epidemiological studies that used one or more of the four ‘omics of interest: epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The epidemiological study designs that were used to explore single or integrated ‘omic research questions with contaminant exposures were cohort studies, controlled trials, cross-sectional, and case-control studies. An interactive web-based systematic evidence map was created to display more study-related information. Conclusions: This systematic evidence map is a novel tool to visually characterize the available environmental epidemiological studies investigating contaminants and biological effects using ‘omics technology and serves as a resource for investigators and allows for a range of applications in chemical research and risk assessment needs. © 2022",,10.1016/j.envint.2022.107243,,NA,

Diseases like cancer, cardiovascular risk, behavioral disorders, autoimmune defects, and reproductive diseases are related to these endocrine disruptors. Because these chemicals exist in known sources such as pharmaceuticals and plasticizers, as well as non-point sources such as agricultural runoff and storm water infiltration, the interactive effects of EDCs are gaining attention. However, the efficiency of conventional treatment methods is not sufficient to fully remediate EDCs from aqueous environments as the occurrence of EDC bioremediation and biodegradation is detected in remediated drinking water. Incorporating modification into current remediation techniques has to overcome challenges such as high energy consumption and health risks resulting from conventional treatment. Hence, the use of advanced psychochemical and biological treatments such as carbon-based adsorption, membrane technology, nanostructured photocatalysts, microbial and enzyme technologies is crucial. Intensifying environmental and health concerns about these mixed contaminants are primarily due to the lack of laws about acute concentration limits of these EDCs in municipal wastewater, groundwater, surface water, and drinking water. This review article offers evidence of fragmentary available data for the source, fate, toxicity, ecological and human health impact, remediation techniques, and mechanisms during EDC removal, and supports the need for further data to address the risks associated with the presence of EDCs in the environment. The reviews also provide comprehensive data for biodegradation of EDCs by using microbes such as fungi, bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, and their extracellular enzymes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119061,,NA,

Studies were included when the patients were affected by any PFDs and cells were isolated, cultured, and characterized as SC. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020216551). A total of 11 prospective clinical studies were included in the final assessment, specifically 7 single-arm studies dealing with SC therapy for stress urinary incontinence and 4 with anal incontinence. Among the latter, there were two prospective, single-arm studies and two randomized controlled trials. No papers concerning the use of SC for prolapse repair were retrieved.

Objective: We conducted a literature review on the bulking agents used in the treatment of SUI, their indications and the different techniques of injection. Material and methods: The literature review followed PRISMA guidelines. We used the Mesh terms: urinary, incontinence, and bulking to search the PubMed database, from the date of conception until June 2020. All studies modalities were included and references lists were also reviewed for relevant articles. Our search identified 60 articles published between 2001 and 2020. References lists review allowed the addition of 40 more articles. In total, 54 articles were included in the descriptive analysis. Results: Bulking agents that are used nowadays are the glutaraldehyde cross-linked bovine collagen, polydimethylsiloxane, calcium hydroxyapatite, porcine dermal implants, carbon coated zirconium beads, and the polyacrylamide hydrogel. Cure rates of bulking agents are lower compared to surgical management. Periurethral injection was found to be beneficial in patients who refuse or who are inadequate for surgical management, or after the failure of the latter. It can be performed via paraurethral or transurethral routes, with comparable efficacy. Ultrasonic, radiographic or endoscopic assistance allow better precision and control of the procedure. Paraurethral route is associated with bigger injected volumes, higher costs, and more complications. Studies showed superiority of the injections in the mid-urethra, in horseshoe or circumferential template. Conclusion: The identification of optimal bulking agent is difficult.

La voie para-urétrale nécessite un volume injectable plus important, avec un coût et un risque de complications supérieurs. L'efficacité des injections paraît supérieure lorsqu'elle est pratiquée en mi-urétral, en forme circonférentielle ou en fer à cheval. Conclusion: L'identification d'un agent optimale est difficile.

The prevailing view is that obesity results from an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure caused by overeating and insufficient exercise. We describe another environmental element that can alter the balance between energy intake and energy expenditure: obesogens. Obesogens are a subset of environmental chemicals that act as endocrine disruptors affecting metabolic endpoints. The obesogen hypothesis posits that exposure to endocrine disruptors and other chemicals can alter the development and function of the adipose tissue, liver, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and brain, thus changing the set point for control of metabolism. Obesogens can determine how much food is needed to maintain homeostasis and thereby increase the susceptibility to obesity. The most sensitive time for obesogen action is in utero and early childhood, in part via epigenetic programming that can be transmitted to future generations. This review explores the evidence supporting the obesogen hypothesis and highlights knowledge gaps that have prevented widespread acceptance as a contributor to the obesity pandemic. Critically, the obesogen hypothesis changes the narrative from curing obesity to preventing obesity. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.bcp.2022.115015,Obesity;Causality,NA,

Here, we assess publication trends, sampling focus, and concentrations observed for a range of emerging contaminants (pharmaceutical and personal care products, pesticides, other endocrine disrupting chemicals, platinum group elements, and microplastics) in the GBA, via a systematic review of papers (n = 407) indexed in Science Direct, SpringerLink and Wiley Online databases. While emerging contaminants form the focus of increasing numbers of publications since 2006, they are understudied compared to more traditionally-measured contaminants (here, DDT and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs). BisphenolA was the most widely studied of the emerging contaminants (n = 41 studies) in the GBA, followed by macrolides (n = 32 studies). While multiple point measurements with high precision and low detection limits have been reported for various emerging contaminants, these have not been integrated for management purposes. A relatively high percentage of studies present data from single deployments (48% of studies, despite strong seasonality in the PRD system), data coverage is variable spatially, and reported contaminant concentrations vary significantly (over one to four orders of magnitude). We assess the currently published knowledge under the Source-Pathway-Receptor contaminant linkage model and use this to identify (a) current research emphasis in relation to assessment of contaminant risk, and (b) key knowledge gaps around sources, pathways and receptors in the GBA system. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.envsci.2022.02.002,China,NA,

We not only summarized the removal of target major pollutants (e.g., hardness, pathogen, and natural organic matter), but also paid attention to the removal of micropollutants of major concern (e.g., disinfection byproducts, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and arsenic). We highlighted that, for different applications, fit-for-purpose design is needed to improve the separation capability for target compounds of NF membranes in addition to their removal of salts. Outlook and perspectives on membrane fouling control, chlorine resistance, integrity, and selectivity are also discussed to provide potential insights for future development of high-efficiency NF membranes for stable and reliable drinking water treatment.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare outcomes of PFA and TKA by evaluation of the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Methods: We systematically identified publications reporting on patients that underwent either TKA or modern PFA for isolated PFOA. Meta-analysis software was used to screen for potential articles with at least two years’ follow-up. Data were extracted and analysed for all PROMs operating time, postoperative inpatient time, complications and cost. We included five studies in our cumulative meta-analysis and reviewed them using Review Manager V.5.0. We computed the risk ratio as a measure of the treatment effect, taking into account heterogeneity. We used random-effect models. Results: No significant difference was found between both TKA and PFA in the context of operating time. No significant difference after five years’ follow-up was found between the two treatment options in terms of UCLA score and patient satisfaction. PFA showed significant improvement in WOMAC score at five-year follow-up, less postoperative inpatient time, better cost-effectiveness and significantly less blood loss. Conclusion: PFA seems to be a viable alternative to TKA for treatment of isolated PFOA in appropriately selected patients. PFA showed less postoperative inpatient time and blood loss with similar PROMs to the TKA. Moreover, it is an economically beneficial joint-preserving procedure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,10.1007/s00402-021-03882-4,Arthroplasty,NA,

The largest surface area (571 m2/g) and pore volume (0.65 cm3/g) were obtained from the N2 physisorption analysis of 1 wt.% Sn-promoted catalyst (E). Cu2O and CuO were identified in the X-ray diffractograms (XRD) of all the catalysts except for catalyst E, which revealed only the peaks of Cu2O owing to the small particle size of CuO below the threshold of detection of XRD. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed the presence of both oxidized and reduced phases of Cu, Fe, Ti, Zr and Sn in their respective catalysts, with the highest and lowest atomic compositions of reduced Fe and CuO, respectively, detected in catalyst E; corroborating findings from XRD analyses. The relatively homogeneous dispersion of phases present in catalyst E (revealed by its smallest crystallite size of 5.1 nm) was also evidenced by the weakest metal-support interaction from the H2-TPR analysis of the same catalyst. Hydroprocessing of oleic acid using catalyst E at 320 °C under H2 pressure of 2.1 MPa and reaction time of 8 h resulted in the highest aviation turbine fuel range hydrocarbons selectivity of 76.8 % and yield of 71.7 %. This was due to its high metal dispersion, desirable textural properties and high oxophilic reduced iron content. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.mcat.2020.111358,Aviation;Hydrocarbons,NA,

Given their unique hydrophobicity, oil-repellence, and chemical stability, PFASs are widely used in various industrial and commercial products. PFASs can accumulate and be biomagnified through the food chain, and its toxic effects have posed a certain threat to human health. The response of the immune system to PFASs exposure is one of the most sensitive human health effects, and has attracted remarkable attention from related scientists and organizations. We summarized international and domestic epidemiological studies on the associations between exposure to PFASs and immune system, including immunosuppression and immunoenhancement. We also reviewed experimental evidence of PFASs on immune system from perspectives of immune organs, immune cells, and cytokines. Furthermore, the possible mechanisms of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α)-dependent, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-activated, and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways were summarized. While the relationships between PFASs and immune-related diseases in human are not yet conclusive, accumulative epidemiological studies provide evidence for associations between PFASs and reduced immune response to vaccination in children. In addition, previous studies mainly focus on the immunotoxicity of traditional PFASs, and our understanding of the molecular mechanism of the effects of PFASs on immune system is still in its infancy. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the immunotoxicity of new PFASs and associated mechanism. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,10.11836/JEOM21237,,NA,

The dependence of the parasite on the host hemoglobin could lead to increased disease severity in the host. In this study, molecular docking analyses were used to evaluate the binding interactions of dipicolinic acid, phenanthroline, and N-ethylmaleimide analogues to P. falciparum falcilysin. The protein databank and the CheBI database were used to find P. falciparum falcilysin and the compounds, respectively. The protein and the collected compounds were imported into PyRx virtual screening software and the docking was initiated. Following that, Discovery Studio was utilized to virtualize the 2D and 3D interactions. The binding energies of 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline 4',4""-disulfonate and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline 4',4""-disulfonic acid were both more than-10.0 kcal/mol among the phenanthroline analogues while only oleanolic acid and N-ethylsuccinimide-mycothiol conjugate from the dipicolinic acid and N-ethylmaleimide analogues had binding energies of-9.7 and-9.4 kcal/mol respectively. The higher binding energies were attributable to hydrogen bond interactions as well as other interactions between the chemicals and the amino acid residues of the falcilysin. The analogues were shown to be moderately safe in pharmacokinetic investigations and scaled Lipinski's rule of five (RO5). The findings of the study revealed that analogues of dipicolinic acid, phenanthroline, and N-ethylmaleimide could serve as potential inhibitors of P. falciparum falcilysin.

Reperfusion may be a necessary condition for positive effects of neuroprotective treatments. This systematic review provides an overview of efficacy of neuroprotective agents in combination with reperfusion therapy in AIS. Methods: A literature search was performed on the following databases, namely PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Emcare. All databases were searched up to September 23rd 2021. All randomized controlled trials in which patients were treated with neuroprotective strategies within 12 h of stroke onset in combination with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), endovascular therapy (EVT), or both were included. Results: We screened 1,764 titles/abstracts and included 30 full reports of unique studies with a total of 16,160 patients. In 15 studies neuroprotectants were tested for clinical efficacy, where all patients had to receive reperfusion therapies, either IVT and/or EVT. Heterogeneity in reported outcome measures was observed. Treatment was associated with improved clinical outcome for: 1) uric acid in patients treated with EVT and IVT, 2) nerinetide in patients who underwent EVT without IVT, 3) imatinib in stroke patients treated with IVT with or without EVT, 4) remote ischemic perconditioning and IVT, and 5) high-flow normobaric oxygen treatment after EVT, with or without IVT. Conclusion: Studies specifically testing effects of neuroprotective agents in addition to IVT and/or EVT are scarce. Future neuroprotection studies should report standardized functional outcome measures and combine neuroprotective agents with reperfusion therapies in AIS or aim to include prespecified subgroup analyses for treatment with IVT and/or EVT.

Owing to their adverse effects on human health and environment, efficient methods of their removal from various complex matrices need to be developed. This review focuses on recent results addressing the adsorption of PFAS on activated carbons (AC) and metal-organic frameworks (MOF). While the former are well-established adsorbents used in water treatment, the latter are relatively new and still not applied at a large scale. Nevertheless, they attract research interests owing to their developed porosity and versatile surface chemistry. While AC provide high volumes of pores and hydrophobic surfaces to strongly attract fluorinated chains, MOF supply sites for acid-base complexation and a variety of specific interactions. The modifications of AC are focused on the introduction of basicity to attract PFAS anions via electrostatic/chemical interactions, and those of MOF - on structural defects to increase the pore sizes. Based on the comparison of the performance and specifically adsorption forces provided by these two groups of materials, activated carbons were pointed out as worthy of further research efforts. This is because their surface, especially that in large pores, where dispersive forces are week and where extensive pore space might be utilized to adsorb more PFAS, can be further chemically modified and these modifications might be informed by the mechanisms of PFAS adsorption, which are specific for MOF. This review emphasizes the effects of these modifications on the adsorption mechanism and brings the critical assessment of the advantages/disadvantages of both groups as PFAS adsorbents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127810,Adsorption,NA,

The research efforts attempt to develop synthetic (chemicals) and natural (biological) adsorbents for remediation of hazardous heavy metals, pesticides, mycotoxins, antibiotics, and other emerging pollutants. However, application of potential adsorbents in remediation lack selectivity and sustainability prospects. Present review aims to provide a critical discussion on adsorption potential of synthetic and natural adsorbents in sustainability framework. The synthetic adsorbents are discussed in terms of recipes and underlying sorption mechanisms. Herein, pragmatic analysis on novel synthetic adsorbents like ferrate, following green chemistry principles and engineered nanoparticles (NPs) is elucidated. In natural biosorbents (both live and dead biomass), the phyto-technologies, biosorption, natural/engineered biochar, clay, and chitosan are comprehensively reviewed. This panoramic review revealed that phytoremediation and biosorption can be preferred as ‘sustainable bioresource eco-technologies’ for remediation of chemical pollution. The interrelationship between adsorbents and United Nations- Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) is established. Eco-friendly and cost-effective biosorbents tend to follow the sustainability paradigm unlike traditional chemical adsorbents.

Modification of maternal metabolism by environmental exposure may be an important pathway for these impacts. However, there is limited evidence regarding exposure to a wide array of chemicals and the metabolome during pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationship between the urinary exposome and metabolome during pregnancy. METHODS: Urine samples were collected in the first and third trimesters from 1,024 pregnant women recruited in prenatal clinics in Jiangsu Province, China. The exposome was analyzed using the first trimester sample with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The metabolome was analyzed using the third trimester sample with UHPLC-HRMS. We evaluated associations between each of 106 exposures in the first trimester with 139 metabolites in the third trimester. RESULTS: We identified 1,245 significant associations (p &lt; 3:39 × 10−6, Bonferroni correction) between chemical exposures and maternal metabolism during pregnancy. Among elements, the largest number of the significant metabolic associations were observed for magnesium, and among organic compounds, for 4-tert-octylphenol. We used exposome–metabolome associations to explore mechanisms underlying published associations between prenatal chemical exposures and offspring health outcomes. This integration of the literature with our results suggests that reported associations between 10 analytes and birth weight, gestational age, fat deposition, neurobehavioral development, immunological disorders, and hypertension may be partially mediated by metabolites associated with these exposures. DISCUSSION: This high-dimensional analysis of the urinary exposome and metabolome identified many associations between chemical exposures and maternal metabolism during pregnancy. Integration of these associations with the literature on health outcomes of exposure suggests that environmental modulation of the maternal metabolome may play a role in the association between prenatal exposure on pregnancy and child health outcomes. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Valproic acid (VPA) is a well-known histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), which due to its epigenetic focus needs to be studied in depth to understand the effects it might elicit in BC cells. The aim of this work is to contribute to exploring the complete pharmacological mechanism of VPA in killing cancer cells using MCF-7. LC-MS/MS metabolomics studies were applied to MCF-7 treated with VPA. The results show that VPA promote cell death by altering metabolic pathways principally pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and 2′ deoxy-α-D-ribose-1-phosphate degradation related with metabolites that decrease cell proliferation and cell growth, interfere with energy sources and enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. We even suggest that mechanisms such as ferropoptosis could be involved due to deregulation of L-cysteine. These results suggest that VPA has different pharmacological mechanisms in killing cancer cells including apoptotic and nonapoptotic mechanisms, and due to the broad impact that HDACis have in cells, metabolomic approaches are a great source of information to generate new insights for this type of molecule. © 2022 by the authors.

It also elaborates the properties of different media, characteristics of attached biomass, and their contributions to AGMBR performance. Conventional media, such as biological activated carbon and polymeric carriers, induce formation of aerobic, anoxic and/or anaerobic microenvironment, increase specific surface area or porous space for biomass retention, improve microbial activities, and enrich diverse microorganisms, thereby enhancing pollutants removal. Meanwhile, new media (i.e. biochar, bioaugmented carriers with selected strain/mixed cultures) do not only eliminate conventional pollutants (i.e. high concentration of nitrogen, etc.), but also effectively remove emerging pollutants (i.e. micropollutants, nonylphenol, adsorbable organic halogens, etc.) by forming thick and dense biofilm, creating anoxic/anaerobic microenvironments inside the media, enriching special functional microorganisms and increasing activity of microorganisms. Additionally, media can improve sludge characteristics (i.e. less extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products, larger floc size, better sludge settleability, etc.), alleviating membrane fouling. Future studies need to focus on the development and applications of more new functional media in removing wider spectrum of emerging pollutants and enhancing biogas generation, as well as scale-up of lab-scale AGMBRs to pilot or full-scale AGMBRs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152123,,NA,

However, investigations into the contamination of ARGs in mining areas have been scarce. Here, the types, abundances, and influencing factors of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were investigated in soil/sediment of the Dexing copper mine area in June 2019 by using high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (HT-qPCR). Furthermore, the influence of heavy metals and MGEs factors on ARGs was studied using the multivariate statistical analysis method. The results showed that there were a variety of ARGs in the Dexing copper mining area, and the maximum detected number of ARGs was 70. At the relative abundance level, the relative abundance of individual sites reached 0.085. In the Dexing copper mine, multidrug, MLSB, β-lactamases, tetracycline, and aminoglycoside resistance genes were the dominant ARG classes based on their numbers. The efflux pump was the most dominant resistance mechanism, followed by antibiotic deactivation and cellular protection. There was a significant positive correlation between the abundance of ARGs and MGEs (P<0.05), and TnpA04 and Inti1 were the most important MEGs in Dexing copper mine samples, indicating that horizontal gene transfer might be an important mechanism for the spread of environmental ARGs. The results of Pearson correlation analysis and RDA analysis showed that the content of Cu was significantly positively correlated with the detected numbers and abundance of ARGs (P<0.05), suggesting that the high content of Cu in the Dexing copper mining area might be an important driving factor for the formation of ARGs. © 2022, Science Press.

However, the molecular mechanism involved in low-level PFOA-induced male endocrine disruption remains to be elucidated. In this study, we performed a combined proteomics and metabolomics analysis to investigate the proteomic and metabolic alterations in MLTC-1 Leydig cells responsive to low levels of PFOA exposure. The results showed that PFOA significantly regulated the expressions of 67 proteins and 17 metabolites, among which 18 proteins and 7 metabolites were specifically tied to lipid and fatty acid metabolism as well as testicular steroidogenesis. It is further suggested that low-dose PFOA stimulates steroid hormone synthesis by accelerating fatty acid metabolism and steroidogenic process, which is involved in the repression of p38 and cAMP-dependent ERK signaling pathway. The animal studies also revealed that environmentally relevant levels of PFOA increased serum steroid hormone levels accompanied by the activated cAMP and inhibited p38/ERK pathway in testis, which confirmed our in vitro findings. Overall, the present study will provide novel insights into the toxicological mechanisms of low-level PFOA-mediated steroidogenic disturbance, and may implicate the reproductive health risk of humans with environmental PFOA exposure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127656,Proteomics,NA,

However, using conventional biological matrices such as urine, blood, or dissected skin to detect BPS/BPA in the human body system requires longer exposure time to them, hardly defines the pollutant source of the accumulated BPS/BPA, and is often invasive. Herein, our new approach i.e. fingerprint analysis quantitatively confirms the transfer of BPS/BPA from receipts (specific pollution source) to human skin only within receipt-handling of “20 s”. When receipts (fingertip region size; ~1 cm2) containing 100–300 μg of BPS or BPA are handled, 20–40 μg fingerprint-1 of BPS or BPA is transferred to human skin (fingertip). This transferred amount of BPS/BPA can still be toxic according to the toxicity test using water fleas. As a visual evidence, a fingerprint map that matches the distribution of the absorbed BPS/BPA is developed using a mass spectrometry imaging tool. This is the first study to analyze fingerprints to determine the incorporation mechanism of emerging pollutants. This study provides an efficient and non-invasive environmental forensic tool to analyze amounts and sources of hazardous substances. © 2021 The Authors",,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127410,,NA,

Postoperative anemia after fracture tends to cause ischemia, hypoxia in cells, tissues and organs, increasing the rate of blood transfusion, risk of infection, disability and mortality. Meanwhile, traditional Chinese medicine is widely used in the treatment of anemia for activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis.Methods:This study is a prospective, outcome assessor-, and data analyst-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial. The objective of this proposed study was to investigate whether Shengyu Decoction could improve the symptoms of anemia after proximal femoral nail antirotation in elderly ITF patients. After qualifying for screening, patients will be randomized into 2 groups with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Hemoglobin concentration, HBL, and HHS score are outcome measurements. The other outcomes also included time to get out of bed, discharge to home, 30-day readmission rates, and mortality.Discussion:ITF is commonly occurring in senior citizens, and those who are senior in age generally suffer 1 or more basic diseases, whose nutritional status is already poor. Trauma and surgical stimulation not only aggravate the existing disease or induce corresponding cardiovascular complications, but also worsen the nutritional status, which can easily cause postoperative anemia in patients. Because of the limited clinical modalities available for the treatment of postoperative anemia after fracture surgery, and most of them have various side effects that are not easily tolerated by the elderly. Therefore, from a traditional Chinese medicine perspective, we proposed a protocol using mild Chinese herbal decoction to treat postoperative anemia in ITF.Registration number: OSF Registration number: DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/JQ6ZF. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

PFOs are present in approximately 25% of the healthy population and are not associated with any pathology in the vast majority of cases. However, comparisons between patients with stroke and healthy controls suggest that PFOs may be causative of stroke in certain patients whose stroke is otherwise cryptogenic. Options for the diagnosis of PFO include transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. PFOs associated with an interatrial septal aneurysm seem to be more strongly linked to risk of recurrent stroke. Therapeutic options for secondary stroke prevention in the setting of a PFO include antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and percutaneous device closure. Recent randomized clinical trials suggest that percutaneous closure reduces the subsequent risk of stroke in appropriately selected patients, with a large relative benefit but small absolute benefit. Referral for percutaneous PFO closure should therefore be considered in certain patients after a multidisciplinary, patient centered discussion. Areas for future study include structural biomarkers to aid in determining the role of PFO closure in older people with possible PFO associated stroke, the role of direct oral anticoagulants, and very long term outcomes after device closure. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Thermal treatment is the most common remediation approach for PFAS-contaminated solid wastes. Although various thermal treatment techniques have demonstrated the potential to destruct PFAS, the fate of PFAS, removal efficacy, potential emissions, and the formation of incomplete combustion products during thermal treatment are little known. This study provides a critical review on the behavior of PFAS based on different types of thermal treatment technologies with various PFAS-impacted environmental medias that include water, soil, sewage sludge, pure PFAS materials, and other PFAS-containing wastes. Different extents of PFAS thermal destruction are observed across various thermal treatment techniques and operating conditions. PFAS removal and destruction efficiencies rely heavily on PFAS structures, the complex combustion chemistry, the presence or absence of oxygen, temperature, and other operational conditions. This review also covers proposed PFAS thermal destruction mechanisms. Different thermal destruction mechanisms for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and other PFAS are reviewed and compared. The majority of studies about PFAS thermal destruction mechanisms were focused on a specific list of PFAS and based mostly on the pyrolysis treatment. The basic pathway for PFAS destruction during pyrolysis is hydrodefluorination, which could be largely influenced by the alkaline condition. Future field-scale research that involves the characterization of PFAS destruction products and incomplete combustion products is needed to address public concerns and better emission control.

Our chemical footprint is often detected using targeted approaches, whereas xenobiotics are embedded within the large pool of dissolved metabolites, altered by biotic and abiotic mechanisms. Thus, it is necessary to simultaneously study anthropogenic signals entwined with the variety of organic signatures that exist in aquatic environments. However, methods for non-targeted analysis of natural metabolites are not always well suited for the analysis of pollutants. Here, we report the reassessment of styrene-divinylbenzene polymer-based Priority PolLutant (PPL) solid-phase extraction (PPL-SPE), which is typically used to extract marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) for biogeochemical studies, to analyze a set of xenobiotics commonly observed in coastal North Pacific seawater. After PPL extraction and analysis by nontargeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), we successfully detected 23 out of 25 selected pharmaceuticals, personal care products, biocides, perfluorocarbons, and polymer additives in a complex marine DOM sample using positive and negative electrospray ionization. We tested two pH conditions to mimic typical marine DOM extraction studies and found mean recovery rates of xenobiotics were approximately 10% higher in seawater pH (pH ~ 8) than in acidified samples (pH ~ 2) for both negative and positive modes, although overall, mean recovery rates were 10% lower in negative mode. Our results indicate that PPL-SPE in combination with non-targeted LC–MS/MS is capable of capturing the tested set of xenobiotics, thus allowing the repurposing of biogeochemical sampling strategies as well as existing DOM samples and MS data for the subsequent assessment of anthropogenic impacts in marine environments. © 2021 The Authors.

Microvascular decompression (MVD) with internal neurolysis (IN) is an alternative treatment that might benefit patients but has limited understanding. We performed a systematic review of IN for the treatment of TN. Methods: Studies from 2000 to 2021 that had assessed IN for TN were aggregated and independently reviewed. Results: A total of 520 patients in 12 studies were identified, with 384 who had undergone IN (mean age, 53.8 years; range, 46–61.4 years; mean follow-up, 36.5 months). Preoperative symptoms had been present for ∼55.0 months before treatment, and pain was predominantly in V2 and V3 (26.8%), followed by other distributions. Of the patients, 83.7% (range, 72%–93.8%) had had an excellent to good outcome (Barrow Neurological Institute pain scale score [BNI-PS], I–II). The pain outcomes at 1 year were excellent for 58%–78.4%, good or better for 77%–93.75%, and fair or better for 80%–93.75% of the patients. On average, facial numbness after IN was experienced by 96% of the patients. However, at follow-up, facial numbness remained in only 1.75%–10%. Most of the remaining numbness was not significantly distressing to the patients. Subgroup comparisons of IN versus recurrent MVD, IN versus radiofrequency ablation, the effects of IN in the absence of vascular compression, and IN with and without MVD were also evaluated. Conclusions: IN represents a promising surgical intervention for TN in the absence of vascular compression and for potential cases of recurrence.

The intensification of shellfish aquaculture to maximize production rate has led to increased generation of aquaculture waste streams, particularly the effluents and shellfish wastes. If not effectively managed, these wastes could pose serious threats to human health and the ecosystem while compromising the overall sustainability of the industry. The present work comprehensively reviews the source, composition, and environmental implications of shellfish wastes and aquaculture wastewater. Moreover, recent advancements in the valorization of shellfish wastes into value-added biochar via emerging thermochemical and modification techniques are scrutinized. The utilization of the produced biochar in removing emerging pollutants from aquaculture wastewater is also discussed. It was revealed that shellfish waste-derived biochar exhibits relatively higher adsorption capacities (300–1500 mg/g) compared to lignocellulose biochar (<200 mg/g). The shellfish waste-derived biochar can be effectively employed for the removal of various contaminants such as antibiotics, heavy metals, and excessive nutrients from aquaculture wastewater. Finally, future research priorities and challenges faced to improve the sustainability of the shellfish aquaculture industry to effectively support global food security are elaborated. This review envisages that future studies should focus on the biorefinery concept to extract more useful compounds (e.g., carotenoid, chitin) from shellfish wastes for promoting environmental-friendly aquaculture. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132559,Review Literature as Topic,NA,

In this study, the comparative profiles of metabolites in three-dimensional (3D) human normal liver (L-02) cell spheroids with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) treatment were analyzed using a metabolomic approach. The uniform 3D cell spheroids were well formed in 3 days (e.g., sphericity index >0.9) and stably maintained over the subsequent 11 days. The cytotoxicity of PFOA to the 3D L-02 cell spheroids was highly dependent on both exposure concentration and duration. Comparative analysis of metabolomes showed that the number of differential metabolites in the 3D cell spheroids treated with 300 μM PFOA for 10 days (n = 59) was greater than those with a 4-day exposure to 300 μM PFOA (n = 17). Six metabolic pathways related to amino acids metabolism were only found in the 3D cell spheroids with a 10-day treatment of 300 μM PFOA, which could not be found in the 2D monolayer cells and those 3D cell spheroids with a 4-day exposure. The suppression of PFOA on glutamine metabolism substantially decreased glutathione (GSH) production and accordingly increased the level of reactive oxygen species in the 3D cell spheroids. On the contrary, the supplementation of glutamine increased GSH production and the viability of cell spheroids, indicating that glutamine metabolism played a critical role in the chronic toxic effects of PFOA. Our study strongly suggested that comprehensive toxicological methodologies based on the 3D cell models could currently be robust and suitable for addressing the chronic adverse effects of toxic contaminants. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150438,"Cells, Cultured",NA,

This review critically examines the strategies to generate highly reactive high-valent iron intermediates, FeVO43– (FeV) and FeIVO44– or FeIVO32– (FeIV) species, from FeVIO42–, for the treatment of polluted water with greater efficiency. Approaches to produce FeV and FeIV species from FeVIO42– include additions of acid (e.g., HCl), metal ions (e.g., Fe(III)), and reductants (R). Details on applying various inorganic reductants (R) to generate FeV and FeIV from FeVIO42– via initial single electron-transfer (SET) and oxygen-atom transfer (OAT) to oxidize recalcitrant pollutants are presented. The common constituents of urine (e.g., carbonate, ammonia, and creatinine) and different solids (e.g., silica and hydrochar) were found to accelerate the oxidation of pharmaceuticals by FeVIO42–, with potential mechanisms provided. The challenges of providing direct evidence of the formation of FeV/FeIV species are discussed. Kinetic modeling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide opportunities to distinguish between the two intermediates (i.e., FeIV and FeV) in order to enhance oxidation reactions utilizing FeVIO42–.

A large number of organic chemicals are termed as “micropollutants” due to their low concentrations, and long-term exposure to micropollutants may pose considerable risks to aquatic organisms and human health. In recent decades, numerous treatment methods and technologies have been proposed to remove micropollutants in water, and typically several micropollutants were chosen as target pollutants to evaluate removal efficiencies. However, it is often unclear whether their toxicity and occurrence levels and frequencies enable them to contribute significantly to the overall chemical pollution in global aquatic environments. This review intends to answer an important lingering question: Which micropollutants or class of micropollutants deserve more attention globally and should be removed with higher priority? Different risk-based prioritization approaches were used to address this question. The risk quotient (RQ) method was found to be a feasible approach to prioritize micropollutants in a large scale due to its relatively simple assessment procedure and extensive use. A total of 83 prioritization case studies using the RQ method in the past decade were compiled, and 473 compounds that were selected by screening 3466 compounds of three broad classes (pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, and industrial chemicals) were found to have risks (RQ > 0.01). To determine the micropollutants of global importance, we propose an overall risk surrogate, that is, the weighted average risk quotient (WARQ). The WARQ integrates the risk intensity and frequency of micropollutants in global aquatic environments to achieve a more comprehensive priority determination. Through metadata analysis, we recommend a ranked list of 53 micropollutants, including 36 PPCPs (e.g., sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen), seven pesticides (e.g., heptachlor and diazinon), and 10 industrial chemicals (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid and 4-nonylphenol) for risk management and remediation efforts. One caveat is that the ranked list of global importance does not consider transformation products of micropollutants (including disinfection byproducts) and new forms of pollutants (including antibiotic resistance genes and microplastics), and this list of global importance may not be directly applicable to a specific region or country. Also, it needs mentioning that there might be no best answer toward this question, and hopefully this review can act as a small step toward a better answer. © 2021 American Chemical Society",,10.1021/acs.est.1c04250,,NA,

The presence of PFAS in ground and surface water can create a route for PFAS to enter the soil, exposing ecosystems (including agroecosystems), where they will move through the food web via biomagnification. The toxicity of PFAS to plants, particularly in agricultural ecosystems, is of emerging concern due to the application of biosolids that are often contaminated with PFAS. Nevertheless, due to the low concentrations of PFAS in most agricultural soils, the direct impact of PFAS on plant health is not well understood. We used 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics to explore the effects of exposure of two key PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, on Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism. We found that Arabidopsis exhibited an accumulation of multiple metabolites, including soluble sugars (glucose and sucrose), multiple amino acids, and tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, suggesting that PFAS exposure impacts the metabolism of plants by causing an accumulation of stress-related amino acids and soluble sugars that drives increased activity of the TCA cycle. The present study shows that 1H-NMR metabolomics is a viable tool for investigating changes in the metabolic profile of plants exposed to PFAS and can be used to illuminate the stress response of plants in a high-throughput, nonbiased manner.

However, the effect of garlic (Allium sativum L), one of such PFAs on the internal egg quality indices of laying hens is less clear. As a result, this meta-analysis investigated the impact of garlic supplementation on egg yolk weight (EYW) and egg yolk cholesterol (EYC) content in laying hens. A search carried out in three online databases yielded five hundred and ten studies of which fifteen passed the predefined selection conditions for the meta-analysis. Inclusion criteria were information on moderator variables (hen’s age, layer strains, presentation form, treatment duration, inclusion level, and the number of hens used for the study), and outcome measures (EYW and EYC) with their corresponding measures of variance. All analyses were performed in OpenMEE software. Results indicate that addition of garlic to layer diets increased EYW by 0.063 g [95% confidence interval (CI) = 95% CI: -0.051, 0.176] compared to zero, though the difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, garlic supplementation reduced EYC concentrations by 0.641 mg/g yolk (95% CI: -0.059, -0.424) in comparison with controls, taking publication bias and heterogeneity into consideration.

The research on atmospheric microplastics (AMPs) started later than that on the MPs in soil and water, but AMPs’ potential environmental impacts are explored in an even wider range. Based on the literatures on AMPs since 2015 as well as those about MPs in water and soil, this paper systematically reviews the distribution, source, transport of AMPS and the environmental and ecological impacts of AMPs. The results show that AMPs are distributed in global atmosphere, and have been detected in the atmosphere of urban, suburban, remote areas and indoor air. The concentrations of AMPs were detected in a range 2 to 77000 n m–2 d–1 or 0 to 1583 n m–3. The distribution characteristics of MPs in atmosphere are affected by environmental factors such as indoor and outdoor environment, underlying surface type and airflow, etc. In general, the concentration and the diversity of AMPs’ shape and composition are higher in the places near to MPs the source, but the wind, precipitation and even local animals could reshape the characters of AMPs. The sources of AMPs are mainly the production, use and recycling processes of plastic products, as well as land and sea where MPs accumulated. Studies also showed that abrasion of vehicle tires and the use of synthetic textile are major sources. What’s noteworthy is that the COVID-19 pandemic has made masks as necessities of life, which indirectly exacerbated the pollution of AMPs. The transport of MPs can occur in atmospheric environment, such as suspension, deposition and diffusion, and is affected by the morphology of MPs, wind direction, precipitation and other atmospheric factors. The diffusion of MPs in atmosphere, also known as atmospheric transport, is an important part of the global plastic cycle. AMPs’ transport path is mostly studied of Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) by conducting backward trajectory simulation, and their transport volume is estimated mainly through deposition and aerodynamic model. In addition, AMPs have unique physical and chemical properties, which can affect regional atmospheric environmental quality, change regional and global climate. It could also adsorb heavy metals, organic pollutants and harmful microorganisms during transport, resulting in greater health risks to human. Also, AMPs could affect atmospheric ecosystems through food chains and providing microbial niches, and alter structure and functions of terrestrial forest and water ecosystems through deposition. There are still some unsolved scientific and technical questions. Due to the lack of standardized sampling and identification means, the past research methods on AMPs are different on sampling and physical analysis, which make information comparison difficult. The observations of AMPs’ environmental behaviors, the atmospheric transport, source attribution and trans-regional effects of AMPs are still limited. Therefore, some conclusions from laboratory researches cannot fully explain the uncertainty of in natural environment. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that future scientific research on AMPs should focus on standardization of research methods, the establishment of source list, transport mechanism and environmental and ecological impacts. It is necessary for the study of AMPs to establish a set of scientifically credible and technically feasible monitoring techniques as well. Because AMPs could be transported to different ecosystems and could enter the human body through a variety of ways, it is urgent to study the physiological and ecological status of human body and ecosystems which are continuously exposed to AMPs pollution. © 2022 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The country is very vulnerable to NTDs due to its favourable tropical climate and multiple risk factors. However, the distribution of the diseases and the populations at risk for the various NTDs is unknown. This paper describes the distribution of lymphatic filariasis (LF) in 58 counties of South Sudan. Methods: a descriptive quantitative cross-sectional study of LF in 58 counties in 8 states of South Sudan recruited adult volunteers aged ≥ 15 years tested for circulating filarial antigens (CFA). A quantitative descriptive statistical was performed to determine the prevalence rates and the endemicity (CFA positivity rate ≥1%) of lymphatic filariasis in 9213 adult individuals from 101 villages. Results: the overall prevalence of positive CFA was 1.6%, and the highest state prevalence was reported in the Upper Nile state at 3.4%. Based on the prevalence of positive CFA 64% of the surveyed counties are endemic to lymphatic filariasis. The endemicity ranged from 1-11.1% positive CFA. The highest prevalence of positive CAF was observed in the >50 years old age group (2.7%), followed by the 46-50 age group (2.3%). Males tested more positive than females (52.4% Vs 47.6%). Participants were three times more likely to test positive for CFA on filarial test strips (FTS) compared to immunochromatographic test (ICT). There was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of positive CFA among the two tests (P=.002). Conclusion: the distribution of LF is widespread, with varying transmission risks. The produced prevalence maps of infection provided evidence on the areas for targeted interventions in the national NTD program in South Sudan. An increased number of positive CFA were identified using FTS than ICT; hence, it is advisable to use FTS in the future transmission survey. © Mutale Nsakashalo Senkwe et al.",,10.11604/pamj.supp.2022.42.1.33895,Prevalence;Cesarean Section;Sudan,NA,

Most of these compounds have been detected in significant amounts in different water matrices (drinking, sewage, ground water). Several conventional and advanced oxidation processes have been used for the removal of ECs. However, these processes are limited by incomplete degradation and high energy input, and some technologies such as adsorption and membrane processes involve only phase transfer of pollutants. According to the USEPA, ECs in the range from ng L−1 to mg L−1 can impose adverse environmental and health effects. This review details the application of nonthermal plasma (NTP) produced by pulsed electrical discharge which has been widely investigated for the abatement of various emerging contaminants in water and wastewater. Since NTP may not be economically suitable as a stand-alone unit for wastewater because of energy costs and the formation of reaction byproducts this review will focus on the integration of NTP in water treatment schemes. In general, single unit water treatment techniques are inadequate for the removal of these recalcitrant compounds. Treatment technologies that combine various advanced oxidation/reduction processes such as NTP with other conventional methods such as biological treatment may have potential for the complete removal of such pollutants. Pre-treatment and post-treatment NTP units can be added based on economic viability and treatment effectiveness. Integrated technologies for removal of ECs from water are critically examined in this review. © 2022, Institute of Electrostatics. All rights reserved.",,10.34343/ijpest.2022.16.e02006,,NA,

Food allergies have a prevalence of 6-8% in children and 2-3% in adults, which is increasing in the last 10 years due to industrialization. The wide variety of ingredients containing food allergens, in combination with the high number of product formulations and processing methods to produce food makes allergen detection a challenge. It is important to highlight that even trace amounts of allergens are able to elicit allergic reactions and the commercialization of food products with a potential health risk is forbidden (European Union Regulation (EU) 178/2002). Hence, precautionary allergen labeling must be provided in the different food products. In addition, this creates a real need for the development of highly sensitive and reliable techniques that allow the detection and quantification of multiple allergens present in trace amounts. This, together with the possibility to perform new allergen discovery studies (shotgun proteomics), makes Proteomic approaches a widely used methodology in this field. In this chapter we summarize the current knowledge regarding food allergies and the proteomic studies performed for the analysis of the different allergens. We briefly describe immunological processes underlying the different types of food allergies, the causative allergens involved in these processes, as well as the different proteomic approaches developed to identify (e.g., LC-MS/MS) and quantify (e.g., targeted proteomics such as selected/multiple reaction monitoring, SRM/MSM) these allergens in different conditions (e.g., complex mixtures, ultra-processed food, etc). Moreover, we have performed a comprehensive review of the different allergens and proteomic studies carried out in the field of plant food allergies, including gluten related disorders (GRDs), pollen-fruit allergy syndrome (PFAS), legumes allergy, and tree-nuts allergy, as well as animal food allergies, including cow´s milk, red meat, egg, fish, and shellfish allergies. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The ambiguity and insufficiency of data when diagnosing adolescent women have been put under special focus. We look at some of the most recent research done to establish relationships between different gene polymorphisms with polycystic ovary syndrome in various populations along with the underestimated impact of environmental factors like endocrine-disrupting chemicals on the reproductive health of these women. Furthermore, the article concludes with existing treatments options and the scopes for advancement in the near future. Various therapies have been considered as potential treatment through multiple randomized controlled studies, and clinical trials conducted over the years are described in this article.

rayyan-934861681,Lubrication Performance and Mechanism of Perfluoropolyether Carboxylate Ammonium Ionic Liquids [全氟聚醚羧酸铵离子液体的润滑性能及润滑机理研究],2022,1,1,,,NA,NA,,"Han Y., Qiao D., Li J., Fan M., Feng D.",,,,,"Perfluoropolyethers (PFPE) is a kind of high performance synthetic lubricant with low volatility, high thermal and oxidation stability, good chemical inertia and insulation performance, as well as a wide range of liquid temperature and excellent viscosity-temperature characteristics. PFPE has been widely used in aerospace, military, nuclear industry, computer disk and other fields. With the rapid development of industrial technology, new requirements have been proposed for the performance of the lubricants. As a result, the common perfluoropolyethers as lubricants gradually cannot work well under the present working conditions. Moreover, it is difficult to improve the lubrication performance of perfluoropolyethers by conventional additives technology due to their poor compatibility with conventional additives. Hence, in order to improve the antifriction and antiwear properties of perfluoropolyethers, researchers focused on modifying their structures. Great efforts have been paid to improve the performance of perfluoropolyethers as lubrication film in the field of computer disk, but as a kind of important aviation lubricating oils, their lubrication performances are also in urgent need of improvement. In this context, in this study three kinds of perfluoropolyether carboxylate ammonium ionic liquids (PF-BA, PF-DBA and PF-TBA) were designed and synthesized by modifying the structure of perfluoropolyether carboxylic acid (PFPEC) with different amines. The structures of synthesized ionic liquids were confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. Their shear stress and viscosity at different shear rates were evaluated by a Rheometer, and the wetting ability on metal surfaces were analyzed by the contact angle. Their lubrication performance for steel/steel and steel/tin bronze friction pairs at 25 ℃ and 100 ℃ were evaluated and compared by Optimal SRV-V oscillating friction and wear tester, where PFPE and PFPEC were used as reference samples. And the variation of the tribofilm during the friction process were revealed by the change of contact resistance. The surface morphologies and element state were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. Tribochemical reactions were investigated by comparing the change in surface morphologies and element state of wear spot. By combining the above results, the lubrication mechanism was explored. Results showed that all the synthesized ionic liquids exhibited higher shear stress and viscosity than PFPEC. Specifically, the ionic liquids with more N-H bonds in the cation exhibited higher viscosity and shear stress, possibly due to the formation of hydrogen bond that can increase the intermolecular interactions. The viscosity and shear stress gradually decreased with the increase of shear rate, while the viscosity of the ionic liquids with more N-H bond in the cation decreased more rapidly. On the surface of tin bronze, the three ionic liquids exhibited better wetting performance than PFPEC, but poorer than PFPE. While on the steel surface, the three ionic liquids exhibited better wetting abilities than PFPEC and PFPE. As lubricants for steel/tin bronze friction pairs, the friction coefficients and wear volumes of the three ionic liquids were close to those of PFPE and PFPEC at room temperature, and their lubrication performance was improved insignificantly. The synthesized ionic liquids exhibited much better anti-friction and anti-wear performance at high temperature (100 ℃) than PFPE and PFPEC. As lubricants for steel/steel friction pairs at room temperature, the friction coefficients of the three ionic liquids were similar to that of PFPEC, and even a little higher than PFPE; while the wear volumes decreased about 60%-70% in comparison with PFPE and PFPEC. At 100 ℃, compared with PFPE and PFPEC, the friction coefficients of the three ionic liquids were much more stable and lower, and the wear volumes were reduced by 70% ~ 80%. Summarily, three synthesized ionic liquids had better friction-reduction and anti-wear properties than that of PFPE and PFPEC both at room temperature and at high temperature as lubricants for steel/steel friction pair. The contact resistances reflected the variation of the tribofilm, i.e. the higher contact resistance, the thicker tribofilm and better lubricating properties. The results of tested contact resistances were consistent with the friction tests results. According to the SEM morphologies of the worn surface lubricated by different lubricants, both the tin bronze and steel worn surfaces exhibited abrasive wear. Among them, the worn surfaces lubricated by ionic liquids PF-TBA were the smoother, and the parallel grooves were the shallower both at room temperature and high temperature. The steel worn surfaces lubricated by the three ionic liquids were much smoother than that of PEPE and PEPEC. From the XPS results, it can be seen that the composition and content of the friction films on the worn surface lubricated by the three synthesized ionic liquids were different from that of PEPEC. The tribofilm formed on the steel surfaces lubricated by the ionic liquids was consisted of Fe3O4, Fe2O3 and FeF3, the nitrogen-containing compounds and adsorbed ionic liquids. The adsorption film of the ionic liquids on the metal surface was strong and the tribofilm was thick. The combined results of multiple physical and chemical analysis showed that the excellent friction-reduction and anti-wear properties of synthesized ionic liquids can be attributed to their excellent adsorption properties on the metal surface and the formation of stable tribofilm.

Hence, there are major incentives for developing minimally invasive methods for lead isotope analysis that are accurate and precise enough to reveal historical information about artefacts and their origin. Portable laser ablation (pLA), collecting microscopic samples on Teflon filters, has four key benefits. It produces no visual impact to the artefacts, does not require transport of artefacts to laboratory facilities, there are no artefact size restrictions, and samples are processed under clean laboratory conditions allowing Pb purification prior to measurement by solution MC-ICPMS. To validate the efficacy of the pLA technique on silver, nine matrixed-matched commercial, in-house and archaeological reference materials were sampled and analysed multiple times (9-10). The pLA mean analyses (±2SD) were all consistent with inter-laboratory bulk analyses. The digestion of sample filters produces precisions that are consistently more than five-times better than in situ nsLA-MC-ICPMS and are the same order of magnitude expected for bulk samples processed in different laboratories.

Although effective water treatment technologies exist for physical removal of many PFAS from water (e.g., activated carbon and ion-exchange resin), a PFAS-concentrated waste stream is generated as an end product that can potentially reintroduce PFAS back into the environment. Thus, there is an increased interest in developing destructive technologies to decompose and mineralize PFAS directly in water or in these waste streams. High energy electron beam (e-beam) accelerators have been used for water treatment to degrade a wide range of recalcitrant contaminants, including PFAS, since the 1960s. However, large-scale applications of e-beam for water treatment are restricted due to its high energy consumption and inability to treat large flow rates. Considering there are very few available technologies for destructive removal of PFAS, this study provides a critical review on the treatment of PFAS by direct irradiation of contaminated water by e-beam from an energy consumption point of view. To date, very limited studies have been conducted to investigate the success of this technology to treat PFAS. Results from the limited studies were not directly comparable due to the variation in operating conditions and water quality parameters used in the studies. Here, for the first time, we develop and apply the concept of electrical energy per order (EE/O) to assess the performance of e-beam for PFAS treatment. Results show that EE/O is a better performance parameter than the G value of e-beam for interstudy comparisons and to evaluate the effects of water quality and operating parameters on e-beam performance. We additionally developed a kinetic scheme to predict the performance of e-beam to treat PFAS and revealed that the competition between species to react with aqueous electrons is the determinant factor influencing PFAS degradation efficiency. Comparison of EE/O values of e-beam (range: 31−176 kWh m−3 order −1) with other destructive technologies (range: 5−9595 kWh m−3 order −1) suggest that e-beam, for PFAS treatment, is a promising approach under favorable conditions. This review further elucidates the feasibility and limitations of e-beam technology that could be improved upon to potentially make e-beam viable for large-scale water treatment applications. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,10.1021/acsestengg.0c00222,,NA,

However, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study aims to investigate biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers underlying the association between serum PFAS and fetal growth using high-resolution metabolomics in a cohort of pregnant African American women in the Atlanta area, Georgia. Methods: Serum perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measurements and untargeted serum metabolomics profiling were conducted in 313 pregnant African American women at 8–14 weeks gestation. Multiple linear regression models were applied to assess the associations of PFAS with birth weight and small-for-gestational age (SGA) birth. A high-resolution metabolomics workflow including metabolome-wide association study, pathway enrichment analysis, and chemical annotation and confirmation with a meet-in-the-middle approach was performed to characterize the biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers of the PFAS-fetal growth relationship. Results: Each log2-unit increase in serum PFNA concentration was significantly associated with higher odds of SGA birth (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.07, 1.63); similar but borderline significant associations were found in PFOA (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.94, 1.49) with SGA. Among 25,516 metabolic features extracted from the serum samples, we successfully annotated and confirmed 10 overlapping metabolites associated with both PFAS and fetal growth endpoints, including glycine, taurine, uric acid, ferulic acid, 2-hexyl-3-phenyl-2-propenal, unsaturated fatty acid C18:1, androgenic hormone conjugate, parent bile acid, and bile acid-glycine conjugate. Also, we identified 21 overlapping metabolic pathways from pathway enrichment analyses. These overlapping metabolites and pathways were closely related to amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism perturbations. Conclusion: In this cohort of pregnant African American women, higher serum concentrations of PFOA and PFNA were associated with reduced fetal growth. Perturbations of biological pathways involved in amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism were associated with PFAS exposures and reduced fetal growth, and uric acid was shown to be a potential intermediate biomarker. Our results provide opportunities for future studies to develop early detection and intervention for PFAS-induced fetal growth restriction. © 2021",,10.1016/j.envint.2021.106964,African Americans,NA,

To investigate whether these alterations reflect inadequate cell energy output, we assessed mitochondrial morphology and central metabolic pathways with emphasis on the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in peripheral leukocytes from patients with acutely decompensated (AD) cirrhosis, with and without ACLF. Methods: The study included samples from patients with AD cirrhosis (108 without and 128 with ACLF) and 41 healthy individuals. Leukocyte mitochondrial ultrastructure was visualized by transmission electron microscopy and cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolic fluxes were determined by assessing NADH/FADH2 production from various substrates. Plasma GDF15 and FGF21 were determined by Luminex and acylcarnitines by LC-MS/MS. Gene expression was analyzed by RNA-sequencing and PCR-based glucose metabolism profiler array. Results: Mitochondrial ultrastructure in patients with advanced cirrhosis was distinguished by cristae rarefication and swelling. The number of mitochondria per leukocyte was higher in patients, accompanied by a reduction in their size. Increased FGF21 and C6:0- and C8:0-carnitine predicted mortality whereas GDF15 strongly correlated with a gene set signature related to leukocyte activation. Metabolic flux analyses revealed increased energy production in mononuclear leukocytes from patients with preferential involvement of extra-mitochondrial pathways, supported by upregulated expression of genes encoding enzymes of the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways. In patients with ACLF, mitochondrial function analysis uncovered break-points in the TCA cycle at the isocitrate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase level, which were bridged by anaplerotic reactions involving glutaminolysis and nucleoside metabolism. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence at the cellular, organelle and biochemical levels that severe mitochondrial dysfunction governs immunometabolism in leukocytes from patients with AD cirrhosis and ACLF. Lay summary: Patients at advanced stages of liver disease have dismal prognosis due to vital organ failures and the lack of treatment options. In this study, we report that the functioning of mitochondria, which are known as the cell powerhouse, is severely impaired in leukocytes of these patients, probably as a consequence of intense inflammation. Mitochondrial dysfunction is therefore a hallmark of advanced liver disease. © 2021 The Authors",,10.1016/j.jhep.2021.08.009,Liver;Leukocytes;Liver Failure,NA,

These metabolism-sensitive diseases typically occur when key metabolic and signaling pathways were disrupted, which can be influenced by the exposure to contaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), along with genetic and lifestyle factors. This promotes the concept and research on environmental metabolism disrupting chemicals (MDCs). In addition, identifying endogenous biochemical markers of effect linked to disease states is becoming an important tool to screen the biological targets following environmental contaminant exposure, as well as to provide an overview of toxicity risk assessment. As such, the current review aims to contribute to the further understanding of exposome and human health and disease by characterizing environmental exposure and effect metabolic biomarkers. We summarized MDC-associated metabolic biomarkers in laboratory animal and human cohort studies using high throughput targeted and nontargeted metabolomics techniques. Contaminants including heavy metals and organohalogen compounds, especially EDCs, have been repetitively associated with metabolic disorders, whereas emerging contaminants such as perfluoroalkyl substances and microplastics have also been found to disrupt metabolism. In addition, we found major limitations in the effective identification of metabolic biomarkers especially in human studies, toxicological research on the mixed effect of environmental exposure has also been insufficient compared to the research on single chemicals. Thus, it is timely to call for research efforts dedicated to the study of combined effect and metabolic alterations for the better assessment of exposomic toxicology and health risks. Moreover, advanced computational and prediction tools, further validation of metabolic biomarkers, as well as systematic and integrative investigations are also needed in order to reliably identify novel biomarkers and elucidate toxicity mechanisms, and to further utilize exposome and metabolome profiling in public health and safety management. © 2021",,10.1016/j.envint.2021.106941,Biological Markers,NA,

The major sources of PFAS to the environment are categorized under direct and indirect sources. The characteristic compounds and concentrations are summarized as found from direct sources such as manufacturing facilities, aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) applications, metal coating operations, and textile and paper coating operations; and from indirect sources such as landfills and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The major findings are: 1) among the aqueous matrices for which data were reviewed, groundwater impacted by AFFF contamination showed the highest median concentrations for both perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), while the second-highest median concentrations were associated with landfill leachates for PFOA and metal-plating sources for PFOS; 2) many of the unknown polyfluorinated precursors present in AFFF-impacted sites could potentially convert to persistent PFAS by abiotic or biotic transformation, and therefore could act as the long-term source of contamination to the environment; 3) part per billion (ppb) concentrations of PFAS were detected in water bodies surrounding fluorochemical manufacturing plants; 4) in consumer products such as textile, paper, and personal care products, PFOA concentrations were an order of magnitude higher compared to other PFAS; 5) biotransformation products such as fluorotelomer carboxylic acids (FTCAs) and perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are detected in landfill leachates and WWTP effluents; and 6) many studies have shown increased PFAA concentrations in WWTP effluents compared to influents. This work provides a comprehensive review of the literature on the PFAS concentration and composition trends of select non-polymeric PFAS in different sources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113879,,NA,

Here, we review the toxic effects of PFASs encountered by various plants from physiological, biochemical and molecular perspectives. The exposure routes and bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites are also summarized. The bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites varied between ng/g and μg/g levels. The 50% inhibition concentration of PFASs for plant growth is often several orders of magnitude higher than the environmentally relevant concentrations (ERCs). ERCs of PFASs rarely lead to obvious phenotypic/physiological damages in plants, but markedly perturb some biological activities at biochemical and molecular scales. PFAS exposure induces the over-generated reactive oxygen species and further damages plant cell structure and organelle functions. A number of biochemical activities in plant cells are perturbed, such as photosynthesis, gene expression, protein synthesis, carbon and nitrogen metabolisms. To restore the desire states of cells exposed to PFASs, plants initiate several detoxifying mechanisms, including enzymatic antioxidants, non-enzymatic antioxidants, metallothionein genes and metabolic reprogramming. Future challenges and opportunities in PFAS phytotoxicity studies are also proposed in the review. © 2021 The Author(s)",,10.1016/j.envint.2021.106891,,NA,

In this comprehensive worldwide review, we collected ecotoxicology and concentration data observed in surface water for 53 high-potency EDs and performed a risk assessment. The compounds were selected from the EU watchlist of priority substances, expanded with new compounds of emerging concern (total 41), where quantifiable data were available for the past three years (2018–2020). The risk quotients ranged from <0.01 for 22 substances to 1974 for tamoxifen. The frequency of samples in which the predicted no-effect concentrations were exceeded also varied, from 1.8% to 92.7%. By using the comprehensive multi-parameter risk assessment in our study, the most current to date, we determined that tamoxifen, imidacloprid, clothianidin, four bisphenols (BPA, BPF, BPS, and BPAF), PFOA, amoxicillin, and three steroid hormones (estriol, estrone, and cyproterone) pose significant risks in the environment. Comparing two structurally very similar bisphenols, BPA and BPB, suggested that the risk from BPB is currently underestimated by at least four orders of magnitude due to the lack of ecotoxicological data availability. The methodological limitations encountered suggest that a standardized methodology for data selection and assessment is necessary, highlighting the fact that some substances are currently under-represented in the field of ecotoxicological research. A new prioritization system is therefore presented, which provides a potential basis for new substances to be included in environmental monitoring lists. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132195,Risk Assessment;Surface Properties,NA,

However, the inherent cause of aggregation capacity related to the ratio of COD to nitrogen (COD/N) is still unclear. In this study, metabolomics analysis was combined with microbiological analyses, granular performance and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) structure to explore the granulation mechanism at different influent COD/N ratios. The results showed that the higher COD/N ratio selectively enhanced the gluconeogenesis pathway, purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathway, resulting in more extracellular polysaccharide (PS) excretion and floc sludge. The absence of carbon source weakened tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) reaction, resulting in NAD+ and ADP decrease, nitrite accumulation and change of microbial community structure. The amino acids biosynthesis pathway was enhanced under low COD/N ratio, which promoted the hydrophobicity of EPS. PDGS had stronger Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs)-based quorum sensing (QS) than DGS during the operational period. CO8-HSL, C8-HSL and C6-HSL, as the main form of AHLs, played a dominating role in DGS and PDGS. Batch tests illustrated that adding AHLs obviously improved the synthesis of the amino acids, threonine (Thr), tryptophan (Trp), methionine (Met) and glycine (Gly). Dosing AHLs regulated PS synthesis only at a high COD/N ratio. The glucose-6P, glycerate-3p and UDP-Glc were up-regulated only in DSG, which increased the hydrophilic groups in EPS. The results not only provided the new insights into the metabolism of denitrifying granular sludge, but also indicated the application potential of the technologies regarding start-up and operation of granule sludge. © 2021",,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131895,,NA,

However, there is a lack of data regarding EDC exposures in humans living in Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines. Hence, this study measured levels of 41 EDCs in women residing in the Greater Manila Area, home to the second largest city in Southeast Asia. Urine samples from women with versus without breast cancer were analyzed for 11 phthalate metabolites, 8 environmental phenols, and 10 bisphenols, while serum samples were analyzed for 12 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Out of the four groups of EDCs analyzed, PFAS were significantly associated with breast cancer (adjusted OR = 13.63, 95% CI: 3.24–94.88 p-trend = 0.001 for PFDoA; adjusted OR = 9.26, 95% CI 2.54–45.10, p-trend = 0.002 for PFDA; and adjusted OR = 2.66, 95% CI: 0.95–7.66, p-trend = 0.004 for PFHxA). Long-chain PFAS levels were positively correlated with age and were significantly higher in women from Region IV-A, a heavily industrialized region, than from the National Capital Region. Overall, this study showed baseline information regarding the level of EDCs in Filipinas, providing a glimpse of EDC exposure in women living in a megalopolis city in Southeast Asia. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131545,Breast Neoplasms,NA,

Population and cross-sectional studies have demonstrated positive correlations between PFOA levels and human health problems. Objectives: Many studies have focused on the hepatotoxicity and liver problems caused by PFOA, with little attention to remediation of these problems. As an antioxidant, vitamin C is frequently utilized as a supplement for hepatic detoxification. Methods: In this study, we use a mouse model to study the possible role of vitamin C in reducing PFOA-induced liver damage. Based on comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of vitamin C. Results: Our results show that vitamin C supplementation reduces signs of PFOA-induced liver damage including total cholesterol and triglyceride levels increase, liver damage markers aspartate, transaminase, and alanine aminotransferase elevation, and liver enlargement. Further, we show that the protective role of vitamin C is associated with signaling networks control, suppressing linoleic acid metabolism, reducing thiodiglycolic acid, and elevating glutathione in the liver. Conclusion: The findings in this study demonstrate, for the first time, the utility of vitamin C for preventing PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity. © 2021",,10.1016/j.jare.2021.04.003,Vitamin E;Vitamin B Complex;Tocopherols;Ascorbic Acid;Vitamins;Vitamin D;Vitamin U;Riboflavin;Vitamin A;Folic Acid;Biotin,NA,

Increasing epidemiological evidence suggest that EDCs may affect the development or progression of breast cancer and consequently lead to lifelong harmful health consequences, especially when exposure occurs during early life in humans. Yet so far no appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic. Objective: To systematically review all the available epidemiological studies about the association of the levels of environmental exposures of EDCs with breast cancer risk. Methods: The search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved articles from PubMed (MEDLINE) until 10 March 2021. The key words used in this research were: “Endocrine disruptor(s)” OR “Endocrine disrupting chemical(s)” OR any of the EDCs mentioned below AND “Breast cancer” to locate all relevant articles published. We included only cohort studies and case-control studies. All relevant articles were accessed in full text and were evaluated and summarized in tables. Results: We identified 131 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. EDCs reviewed herein included pesticides (e.g. p,p’-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), atrazine, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin)), synthetic chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), parabens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contraceptive pills), phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein, resveratrol), and certain mycotoxins (e.g. zearalenone). Most studies assessed environmental EDCs exposure via biomarker measurements. Conclusion: We identified certain EDC exposures could potentially elevate the risk of breast cancer. As majority of EDCs are highly persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative, it is essential to assess the long-term impacts of EDC exposures, especially multi-generational and transgenerational. Also, since food is often a major route of exposure to EDCs, well-designed exposure assessments of potential EDCs in food and food packing are necessary and their potential link to breast cancer development need to be carefully evaluated for subsequent EDC policy making and regulations. © 2021 The Author(s).

Despite having similar physicochemical properties, enantiomers may differ in their interactions with enzymes, receptors and other chiral molecules leading to different biological response. Their differences in bio-degradation, transformation or accumulation should be carefully considered when assessing health risks since they can affect living organisms in a different way. This work reviews the behavior of several groups of environmentally relevant chiral contaminants including pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, perfluoroalkyl substances, brominated flame retardants, pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls and their main metabolites. The enantioselectivity and fate of these compounds in: i) wastewater treatment plants, ii) aquatic and terrestrial environments; and iii) living organisms is discussed. It cannot be predicted whether each specific enantiomer of a chiral compound will be preferably enriched or degraded. The extent of stereoselectivity is associated to several factors, including the specific chiral pollutant, the environmental matrix, the treatment technology used, as well as the season and local environmental factors (pH, soil texture, porosity, organic amended), which are in turn influenced by the activity of the microbial communities. Therefore the environmental fate of enantiomers always needs to be investigated. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,10.1080/10643389.2021.1900764,,NA,

However, as a result of modernization, water consumption is dramatically in increase although the water supply remains constant. Unfortunately every sector consumes water resulting in massive amounts of wastewater that requires treatment prior to their final disposal that still a challenge to the modern societies. Among the various technologies investigated, adsorption considered the most widely applied technology for safe environmental remediation. In this regard, the term of green adsorbents is introduced that is meant the low-cost materials originated from waste, i.e., agriculture waste to be valuable adsorbents. Thus, extensive list of different adsorbents from natural, industrial waste, agriculture bio-products or modified materials have been applied for the elimination of various contaminants from aqueous matrix are compiled here as a demanding area since it has double benefits as an industrial ecology approach. Also, this article discusses the basic principles of adsorption process including the adsorption isotherm and kinetic models. Although numerous review articles are dealing with low-cost adsorption performances, there is insufficient information on the emerging pollutants elimination. The major focus of this work is highlighting the research on the application of the low-cost adsorbents on the emerging pollutants, namely, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, personal care products and perfluorinated compounds. Scattered information on using various adsorbents are provided information in adsorbing emerging pollutants uptake reached to 920 mg/g. The main parameters that affect the adsorption process and the economic prospective is also discussed. Desorption and recycling scenario is concluded and desorption efficiency could reach to 99%.
