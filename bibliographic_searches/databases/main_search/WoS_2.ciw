TI Distribution of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in breast milk, cord
   blood and placentas: a systematic review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been extensively used as flame retardants in consumer products. PBDEs rapidly bioaccumulate in the environment, food, wild animals and humans. In this review, we investigated the harmful effects of PBDEs on humans, especially in early life, and summarised the levels of PBDEs in human biological samples (breast milk, cord blood and placentas). In addition, we described the spatiotemporal distribution of PBDEs in this review. PBDE levels in breast milk, cord blood and placentas were generally higher in North America than in other regions, such as Asia, Europe, Oceania and Africa. However, high levels of PBDEs in human biological samples were detected at e-waste recycling sites in South China, East China and South Korea. This finding suggests that newborns living in e-waste regions are exposed to high levels of PBDEs during prenatal and postnatal periods. The time trends of PBDE concentration differed according to the region. Few studies have investigated PBDE levels in humans from 1967 to 2000, but they increased rapidly after 2000. PBDE concentration peaked at approximately 2006 globally. Compared with other PBDE congeners, BDE-47, BDE-153 and BDE-209 were the major components, but the detection rate of BDE-209 was lower than those of others. Future studies should focus on determining the BDE-209 concentration, which requires the implementation of different analytical approaches. Additionally, the levels of PBDEs in human samples and the environment should be monitored, especially in e-waste recycling regions.

TI Endocrine-disrupting chemicals and the regulation of energy balance
SO NATURE REVIEWS ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Energy balance involves the adjustment of food intake, energy expenditure and body fat reserves through homeostatic pathways. These pathways include a multitude of biochemical reactions, as well as hormonal cues. Dysfunction of this homeostatic control system results in common metabolism-related pathologies, which include obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metabolism-disrupting chemicals (MDCs) are a particular class of endocrine-disrupting chemicals that affect energy homeostasis. MDCs affect multiple endocrine mechanisms and thus different cell types that are implicated in metabolic control. MDCs affect gene expression and the biosynthesis of key enzymes, hormones and adipokines that are essential for controlling energy homeostasis. This multifaceted spectrum of actions precludes compensatory responses and favours metabolic disorders. Herein, we review the main mechanisms used by MDCs to alter energy balance. This work should help to identify new MDCs, as well as novel targets of their action.

TI Reducing chemical exposures at home: opportunities for action
SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
AB Indoor environments can influence human environmental chemical exposures and, ultimately, public health. Furniture, electronics, personal care and cleaning products, floor coverings and other consumer products contain chemicals that can end up in the indoor air and settled dust. Consumer product chemicals such as phthalates, phenols, flame retardants and per-and polyfluorinated alkyl substances are widely detected in the US general population, including vulnerable populations, and are associated with adverse health effects such as reproductive and endocrine toxicity. We discuss the implications of our recent meta-analysis describing the patterns of chemical exposures and the ubiquity of multiple chemicals in indoor environments. To reduce the likelihood of exposures to these toxic chemicals, we then discuss approaches for exposure mitigation: targeting individual behaviour change, household maintenance and purchasing decisions, consumer advocacy and corporate responsibility in consumer markets, and regulatory action via state/federal policies. There is a need to further develop evidence-based strategies for chemical exposure reduction in each of these areas, given the multi-factorial nature of the problem. Further identifying those at greatest risk; understanding the individual, household and community factors that influence indoor chemical exposures; and developing options for mitigation may substantially improve individuals' exposures and health.

TI Manipulating tumor hypoxia toward enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT)
SO BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered a promising approach for the treatment of cancer and is achieved via the photosensitizer (PS)- mediated incomplete reduction of oxygen upon light irradiation, which generates high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce potent vascular damage and to directly kill tumor cells. However, there is an undesirable impediment with this approach in that tumor tissues generally suffer from serious hypoxia, which significantly affects the efficiency of PDT. Additionally, PDT that consumes oxygen will further aggravate tumor hypoxia, thus potentially leading to multiple undesirable consequences, such as angiogenesis, tumor invasiveness, and tumor metastasis. This mini-review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent research progress on overcoming or utilizing tumor hypoxia to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of PDT.

TI Autologous Fat Injection for Treatment of Velopharyngeal Insufficiency
SO JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY
AB Background:Management of velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) has traditionally involved surgical repair to improve speech. Posterior pharyngeal augmentation using injectable synthetic materials has been advocated. However, outcomes have been equivocal. More recently, autologous fat injection (AFI) has been advocated for correction of mild to moderate VPI. However, long-term efficacy and safety of this procedure remain unsettled.Methods:A systematic review of the literature was performed. Available studies that reported outcomes of autologous fat velopharyngeal injection for treatment of documented VPI were included. Preclinical animal studies were excluded. Study characteristics, patient demographics, treatment details including fat harvest site, volume injected, and outcome measures were evaluated.Results:Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria, yielding 251 patients who underwent AFI. There was high variability in terms of indications for procedure and reporting of outcomes. Majority of studies required velopharyngeal gap closure of at least 50% in order to undergo AFI. Most common etiology of VPI was secondary to cleft palate. Some studies included patients with velocardiofacial syndromes. Improvements in speech and nasalance were reported in a majority of patients. Major complications were rare. Only 1 patient with graft hypertrophy resulting in obstructive sleep apnea was reported.Conclusion:Autologous fat injection offers a minimally invasive approach to the treatment of VPI. Current literature is limited to small noncomparative studies. These appear to suggest efficacy and safety in mild to moderate patients with VPI. Future prospective studies with standardized technique and objective outcomes are required to definitively establish its safety and efficacy, as well as define patient selection criteria.

TI Survivorship and functional outcomes of patellofemoral arthroplasty: a
   systematic review
SO KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY
AB Historically poor results of survivorship and functional outcomes of patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) have been reported in the setting of isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis. More recently, however, fairly good results of PFA were reported, but the current status of PFA outcomes is unknown. Therefore, a systematic review was performed to assess overall PFA survivorship and functional outcomes.
   A search was performed using PubMed, Embase and Cochrane systems, and the registries were searched. Twenty-three cohort studies and one registry reported survivorship using Kaplan-Meier curve, while 51 cohort studies reported functional outcomes of PFA.
   Twelve studies were level II studies, while 45 studies were level III or IV studies. Heterogeneity was mainly seen in type of prosthesis and year the cohort started. Nine hundred revisions in 9619 PFAs were reported yielding 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-year PFA survivorships of 91.7, 83.3, 74.9 and 66.6 %, respectively, and an annual revision rate of 2.18. Functional outcomes were reported in 2587 PFAs with an overall score of 82.2 % of the maximum score. KSS and Knee Function Score were 87.5 and 81.6 %, respectively.
   This systematic review showed that fairly good results of PFA survivorship and functional outcomes were reported at short- and midterm follow-up in the setting of isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis. Heterogeneity existed mainly in prosthesis design and year the cohort started.
   These results provide a clear overview of the current status of PFA in the setting of isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis.

TI [F-18]Fluoroalkyl azides for rapid radiolabeling and (Re)investigation
   of their potential towards in vivo click chemistry
SO ORGANIC & BIOMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY
AB In recent years, radiofluorinated alkyl azides have been reported for click radiolabeling and pretargeted PET imaging, but only little is known about the biodistribution and metabolism of these compounds. In this work, we present a significantly improved procedure for the synthesis of [F-18] fluoroethyl azide and reinvestigated this radiolabeled probe in detail showing poor stability and very restricted suitability for in vivo application. Therefore, modified low-molecular-weight [F-18] fluoroalkyl azides were developed. Propargyl-tagged endomorphin-1 (as model compound) was successfully radiolabeled in high yield and short reaction time making these probes useful and efficient bioorthogonal tools for rapid radiolabeling. Biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and in vivo stability were studied by preclinical PET/MR scanning and metabolite analysis. The results of this study revealed only limited applicability of [F-18] fluoroalkyl azides for in vivo application.

TI Cumulative effects of prenatal- exposure to exogenous chemicals and
   psychosocial stress on fetal growth: Systematic-review of the human and
   animal evidence
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background Adverse effects of prenatal stress or environmental chemical exposures on fetal growth are well described, yet their combined effect remains unclear.
   Objectives To conduct a systematic review on the combined impact and interaction of prenatal exposure to stress and chemicals on developmental outcomes.
   Methods We used the first three steps of the Navigation Guide systematic review. We wrote a protocol, performed a robust literature search to identify relevant animal and human studies and extracted data on developmental outcomes. For the most common outcome (fetal growth), we evaluated risk of bias, calculated effect sizes for main effects of individual and combined exposures, and performed a random effects meta-analysis of those studies reporting on odds of low birthweight (LBW) by smoking and socioeconomic status (SES).
   Results We identified 17 human-and 22 animal-studies of combined chemical and stress exposures and fetal growth. Human studies tended to have a lower risk of bias across nine domains. Generally, we found stronger effects for chemicals than stress, and these exposures were associated with reduced fetal growth in the low-stress group and the association was often greater in high stress groups, with limited evidence of effect modification. We found smoking associated with significantly increased odds of LBW, with a greater effect for high stress (low SES; OR 4.75 (2.46 -9.16)) compared to low stress (high SES; OR 1.95 (95% CI 1.53 -2.48)). Animal studies generally had a high risk of bias with no significant combined effect or effect modification.
   Conclusions We found that despite concern for the combined effects of environmental chemicals and stress, this is still an under-studied topic, though limited available human studies indicate chemical exposures exert stronger effects than stress, and this effect is generally larger in the presence of stress.

TI Exposure to Perfluorinated Alkyl Substances and Health Outcomes in
   Children: A Systematic Review of the Epidemiologic Literature
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals used to make products stain and stick resistant, have been linked to health effects in adults and adverse birth outcomes. A growing body of literature also addresses health effects in children exposed to PFAS. This review summarizes the epidemiologic evidence for relationships between prenatal and/or childhood exposure to PFAS and health outcomes in children as well as to provide a risk of bias analysis of the literature. A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed for studies on PFAS and child health outcomes. We identified 64 studies for inclusion and performed risk of bias analysis on those studies. We determined that risk of bias across studies was low to moderate. Six categories of health outcomes emerged. These were: immunity/infection/asthma, cardio-metabolic, neurodevelopmental/attention, thyroid, renal, and puberty onset. While there are a limited number of studies for any one particular health outcome, there is evidence for positive associations between PFAS and dyslipidemia, immunity (including vaccine response and asthma), renal function, and age at menarche. One finding of note is that while PFASs are mixtures of multiple compounds few studies examine them as such, therefore the role of these compounds as complex mixtures remains largely unknown.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED OXIDATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been recently listed as emerging contaminants (ECs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) due to their human and environmental health concerns. In the last 10 years, their detection and remediation have progressed significantly. Herein, we critically review recent developments in electrochemical advanced oxidation process (EAOP) towards their remediation. Particular attentions are paid to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which present the main concerns of PFASs at this time. Due to the persistence of those PFASs, other remediation approaches may experience difficulty in degrading them, whilst EAOP has demonstrated success. The fundamentals of EAOP are highlighted and the scale-up application is discussed regarding the future research directions.

TI Systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence of, and risk factors
   for, pelvic floor disorders in community-dwelling women in low and
   middle-income countries: a protocol study
SO BMJ OPEN
AB Introduction Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) including urinary incontinence, faecal incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse are common debilitating conditions among women in high-income countries. However, PFDs in women in low/middle-income countries (LMICs) have not been studied extensively. We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to determine the prevalence of, and/or risk factors for, PFDs in women in LMIC.
   Methods and analysis We will search electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Maternity & Infant Care and Google Scholar for eligible studies. Inclusion criteria will be observational studies of healthy women, which have collected data using validated or non-validated tools, are published in English and were conducted in community women in LMICs, defined by the World Bank. A standardised data extraction form will be developed and piloted, based on the template of the Cochrane good practice data extraction form. All included studies will be assessed based on a risk-of-bias tool specifically developed for prevalence studies. Pooled prevalence estimates of PFDs will be generated using RevMan V.5.2.1 software. Forest plots will be generated to display the overall random-effects pooled estimates with CIs. A metaregression will be conducted to identify sources of between-study heterogeneity in the pooled prevalence estimates. We will quantify heterogeneity using the I-2 measure and its CI. We will use funnel plots to detect potential reporting biases and small-study effects. We will also conduct a sensitivity analysis to verify the robustness of the study conclusions, assessing the impact of methodological quality, study design, sample size and the effect of missing data.
   Ethics and dissemination Our review is entirely based on published data. Thus, an ethics committee approval or written informed consent will not be required for this study as primary data will not be collected. The results will be disseminated by publication of the manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal and/or will be presented at relevant conferences.

TI Endocrine disruptors: Evidence from epidemiological studies necessitates
   a critical review of model systems
SO BUNDESGESUNDHEITSBLATT-GESUNDHEITSFORSCHUNG-GESUNDHEITSSCHUTZ
AB Endocrine disruptive chemicals (EDCs) cause adverse health effects through interaction with endocrine systems. They are classified by chemical structure, effects on specific endocrine systems, bioaccumulation, persistence in the environment, or clinically observable effects. For research of the complex mechanisms of action in the human body, only in vitro model systems have so far been available, that have insufficient high-throughput capacity, which makes risk evaluation more difficult. In addition, in industrial nations, living people are often exposed to mixtures of substances, with various effects. The clinical importance of epigenetic changes caused by the action of EDCs during vulnerable phases of development is currently unclear. Epidemiological studies are criticized because reproducibility is not always guaranteed. Nevertheless, they remain the method of choice for the development and analysis of suitable model systems. Positive associations, in spite of sometimes conflicting results, are key in the selection of factors that can then be analysed in model systems in an unbiased way. This article depicts the mainly positive epidemiological findings for EDC-caused effects in the fields of growth and metabolism, neurocognitive development and sexual development and reproduction. As a result, there is a need for closer linkage between epidemiological studies and mechanistic research into model systems, especially focusing on the interaction of different EDCs and the consequences of prenatal and early life exposure.

TI Quantitation of levodopa and carbidopa in rat plasma by LC-MS/MS: The
   key role of ion-pairing reversed-phase chromatography
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL
   AND LIFE SCIENCES
AB A simple and selective bioanalytical method was developed for simultaneous determination of levodopa and carbidopa in rat plasma by LC-MS/MS. Levodopa and carbidopa are small polar molecules, posing challenges in the development of selective and efficient chromatography conditions. Perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPA), a volatile ion-pairing agent, was utilized to enhance chromatographic characteristics of both compounds in the reversed-phase mechanism. The ion-pairing chromatography played an essential role in mitigating matrix effects and achieving adequate separation between interfering background peaks and those of the analytes of interest, especially for levodopa. A 96-well based, automated liquid-liquid extraction, via the use Hamilton NIMBUS liquid handlers, was developed. Butyl alcohol, when mixed with ethyl acetate, greatly increased the recovery of both levodopa and carbidopa. The addition of PFPA further enhanced recovery for both analytes. Sodium metabisulfite, an antioxidant, was used to stabilize levodopa and carbidopa in rat plasma. The method was validated in the ranges of 50-10,000 ng/mL and 25-5000 ng/mL for levodopa and carbidopa, respectively, using levodopa-d3 and carbidopa-d3 as internal standards. The validated method was successfully applied to analyze rat plasma samples from in-life studies.

TI HPLC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantification of
   desmethylmebeverine acid, mebeverine acid and mebeverine alcohol in
   human plasma along with its application to a pharmacokinetics study
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS
AB A new simple, rapid and sensitive high pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for simultaneous analysis of mebeverine metabolites as: mebeverine alcohol (MAL), mebeverine acid (MAC) and desmethylmebeverine acid (DMAC) in human plasma. Sample preparation was performed by protein precipitation following the separation of analytes using an Acquity UPLC BEN C8 column 1.7 mm 2.1 x 50 mm (Waters, USA). H-2(5)-desmethylmebeverine acid (H-2(5)-DMAC) was used as the internal standard (IS). The proposed method was validated with linear ranges of 0.1-10 ng/mL; 1-100 ng/mL and 5-1000 ng/mL for MAL, MAC and DMAC, respectively. Accuracy for all analytes (%RE), given as deviation between nominal and measured concentration and assay variability (CV) ranged from -4.04% to 4.60% and from 0.31% to 6.43% respectively both for within- and between-run. The overall recoveries for all metabolites were above 85%. The proposed method was used successfully for analysis of real samples from a pharmacokinetics study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI In-stream detection of waterborne priority pollutants, and applications
   in drinking water contaminant warning systems
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY
AB Advancements in real-time water monitoring technologies permit rapid detection of in-stream, inpipe water quality, and alert of threats from waste loads. Legislation mandating the establishment of water resources monitoring, presence of hazardous contaminants in effluents, and perception of the vulnerability of the water distribution system to attacks, have spurred technical and economic interest. Alternatively to traditional analyzers, chemosensors operate according to physical principles, without sample collection (online), and are capable of supplying parameter values continuously and in real-time. This review paper contains a comprehensive survey of existing and expected online monitoring technologies for measurement/detection of pollutants in water. The state-of-the-art in online water monitoring and contaminant warning systems is presented. Application examples are reported. Monitoring costs will become a lesser part of a water utility budget due to the fact that automation and technological simplification will abate human cost factors, and reduce the complexity of laboratory procedures.

TI Review of the molluscicide metaldehyde in the environment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
AB Metaldehyde is the active ingredient in most slug pellets used to protect crops. This molluscicide is considered an emerging pollutant and is frequently detected in surface water bodies above the EU statutory drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g L-1 for a pesticide. This presents a challenge for providers of drinking water. Understanding the sources, transport and environmental fate of this compound is therefore important. This critical review discusses these aspects including monitoring and analytical techniques used for the detection of metaldehyde in environmental matrices. Novel techniques used for the removal of metaldehyde from drinking water are presented together with potential catchment management strategies and initiatives useful for the mitigation of this molluscicide in the environment.

TI Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas associated with high-grade
   serous ovarian carcinomas: a systematic review
SO BJOG-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY
AB BackgroundSerous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) have been documented in high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs). However, the rate of association between STICs and HGSOCs and, therefore, the fraction of HGSOCs that are likely to have originated from the fallopian tube (FT), has remained unclear.
   ObjectiveTo appraise the literature describing the association between STICs and established HGSOCs.
   Search strategyOvid MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched.
   Selection criteriaStudies were included if they evaluated the frequency of STICs in HGSOCs, and were published in an English peer-reviewed journal.
   Data collection and analysisAppropriate studies were evaluated for their compliance with the Strengthening and Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)' criteria.
   Main resultsTen articles met the study selection criteria. The reported coexistence between STICs and HGSOCs ranged from 11% to 61% (mean: 31%, 95% CI: 17-46%). STICs were rarely found in other gynaecological cancers. Small sample size, lack of objective criteria to identify STICs and the retrospective nature of the studies contributed to the variability in reporting the rate of the association.
   ConclusionsSTICs were identified commonly in the FTs of women with HGSOC. Finding the true rate of association between STICs and HGSOCs will require further investigations. While there is evidence that a fraction of HGSOCs arise from the FTs, an accurate estimate of that fraction remains to be determined. The lack of an accurate estimate of the association makes it difficult to evaluate the potential magnitude of reduction of HGSOCs following prophylactic salpingectomy.
   Tweetable abstractA systematic review of the incidence of STICs in HGSOCs identifies significant methodological inconsistencies.

TI Is body mass index associated with patellofemoral pain and
   patellofemoral osteoarthritis? A systematic review and meta-regression
   and analysis
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
AB Background Patellofemoral pain (PFP) occurs frequently, and may be related to patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). Obesity is associated with increased risk of knee OA. This systematic review involves a meta-regression and analysis to determine the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and PFP and PFOA, and to determine the link between BMI and interventional outcomes.
   Methods We searched seven electronic databases and reference lists of relevant papers and systematic reviews, for cross-sectional, prospective, human-based observational and interventional studies reporting BMI in individuals with PFP or PFOA compared to healthy controls. Two independent reviewers appraised methodological quality (epidemiological appraisal instrument). Where possible, data from prospective studies were pooled to conduct meta-regression and case-control, and intervention studies to conduct meta-analysis using the following categories: adolescents with PFP, adults with PFP and PFOA.
   Results 52 studies were included. We found greater BMI in adults with PFP (standardised mean difference: 0.24, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.36) and PFOA (0.73, 0.46 to 0.99) compared to healthy controls, but not in adolescents with PFP (-0.19, -0.56 to 0.18). We also observed statistical trends (p<0.10) towards higher BMI being a predictor for development of PFP in adults (0.34, -0.04 to 0.71). No significant link between BMI and intervention outcomes in adults with PFP was identified.
   Conclusions Higher BMI is present in PFP and PFOA, but not in adolescents with PFP.

TI Rapid Differentiating Colorectal Cancer and Colorectal Polyp Using Dried
   Blood Spot Mass Spectrometry Metabolomic Approach
SO IUBMB LIFE
AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading causes of cancermortality, and the early-stage detection could significantly enhance survival rates. Cancer influences the important metabolic pathways and the changes in metabolite levels had been used in many studies as the potential biomarkers. This study is aimed at screening metabolite biomarkers with CRC diagnosis potentials. The direct infusion mass spectrometry (MS) metabolomic analysis based on dried blood spot was used to distinguish CRC from polyp. The target metabolites were composed of 23 amino acids and 26 acylcarnitines. The 21 metabolites in blood were selected via multivariate analysis. A regression model was established based on parameters C16, Arg, C4/C8, C5/C3, Val, Phe/Tyr, Ala, C4/C3. Tenfold cross validation (CV) method was used to test this model and showed sensitivity of 81.18% and specificity of 83.95%. The metabolomic analysis is a practicable method for CRC detection. The use of direct MS analysis in metabolite screening could be finished in several minutes and served as a higher-throughput method to distinguish CRC and polyps. (C) 2017

TI Recent advancements in the sonophotocatalysis (SPC) and
   doped-sonophotocatalysis (DSPC) for the treatment of recalcitrant
   hazardous organic water pollutants
SO ULTRASONICS SONOCHEMISTRY
AB Sonophotocatalysis (SPC) is considered to be one of the important wastewater treatment techniques and hence attracted the attention of researchers to eliminate recalcitrant hazardous organic pollutants from aqueous phase. In general, SPC refers to the integrated use of ultrasonic sound waves, ultraviolet radiation and the addition of a semiconductor material which functions as a photocatalyst. Current research has brought numerous improvements in the SPC based treatment by opting visible light irradiation, nanocomposite catalysts and numerous catalyst supports for better stability and performance. This review accomplishes a critical analysis with respect to the recent advancements. The efficiency of SPC based treatments has been analyzed by considering the individual methods i.e. sonolysis, photocatalysis, sonophotolysis, sono-ozone, photo-Fenton and sono-Fenton. Besides, the essential parameters such as solution temperature, concentrations of initial pollutant and catalyst, initial pH, dosages of Fenton's reagent and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ultrasonic power density, gas sparging, addition of radical scavenger, addition of carbon tetrachloride and methanol have been discussed with suggestions for the selection of optimum parameters. A higher synergistic pollutant removal rate has been reported during SPC treatment as compared to individual methods and the implementation of numerous doping materials and supports for the photocatalyst enhances the degradation rate of pollutants using DSPC under both visible and UV irradiation. Overall, SPC and DSPC based wastewater treatments are emerging as potential techniques as they provide effective solution in removing the recalcitrant organic pollutants and progressive research is expected to bring out superior treatment efficiency using these advanced technologies. Importance of this review: The review has accomplished a thorough and a critical analysis of sonophotocatalysis (SPC) based on the recently published journals. Recent advancements in the doped sonophotocatalysis (DSPC) and the mechanisms behind synergistic enhancement in the pollutant degradation rate have been discussed with justifications. Besides, the possible future works are suggested for the advancements in sonophotocatalysis based treatment. This review will be beneficial for electing a SPC based method because of the accomplished sharp comparisons among the published results. The review includes current advancements of SPC based methods which aid for a low-cost and a large-scale wastewater treatment application. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Enzymatic Halogenation and Dehalogenation Reactions: Pervasive and
   Mechanistically Diverse
SO CHEMICAL REVIEWS
AB Naturally produced halogenated compounds are ubiquitous across all domains of life where they perform a multitude of biological functions and adopt a diversity of chemical structures. Accordingly, a diverse collection of enzyme catalysts to install and remove halogens from organic scaffolds has evolved in nature. Accounting for the different chemical properties of the four halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) and the diversity and chemical reactivity of their organic substrates, enzymes performing biosynthetic and degradative halogenation chemistry utilize numerous mechanistic strategies involving oxidation, reduction, and substitution. Biosynthetic halogenation reactions range from simple aromatic substitutions to stereoselective C-H functionalizations on remote carbon centers and can initiate the formation of simple to complex ring structures. Dehalogenating enzymes, on the other hand, are best known for removing halogen atoms from man-made organohalogens, yet also function naturally, albeit rarely, in metabolic pathways. This review details the scope and mechanism of nature's halogenation and dehalogenation enzymatic strategies, highlights gaps in our understanding, and posits where new advances in the field might arise in the near future.

TI Health risks associated with the pharmaceuticals in wastewater
SO DARU-JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
AB The overwhelming population growth in recent decades and water crisis along with limited and uneven geographical distribution of fresh water resources is a growing challenge for the economic and human development. Wastewater reclamation and use could be an alternative for intact water sources and a promising solution to water scarcity and unequal distribution. However, wastewater is a double-edged resource both as an accessible water source for food production and human usage and concurrently may carry uncharacterized content with unknown toxicological profile causing acute or long-term health risks. Pharmaceuticals, cosmeceuticals, nanomaterials and their chemical decomposition derivatives found in wastewater are not well known in many cases. Their unknown toxicity, teratogenicity and carcinogenicity profile associated with lack of monitoring and control measures impose a significant hazard risk on the public health. This paper reviews the evidence on the health risks associated with the wastewater use for irrigated food production and the imposed risk on the end consumers mainly from pharmaceutical industry and related research facilities. Then, we suggest an applied framework for planning and policy-making to mitigate the health risks and optimally employ reclaimed wastewater for human purposes.

TI Research Progresses of Determination of Perfluorinated Compounds in
   Environmental Water and Solid Samples
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), a group of persistent organic pollutants, have been widely detected in environmental media and posed great threats to human health. The researches on environmental pollution and health risk of PFCs have become the hot subject in recent years. The advanced and reliable analytical methods for determination of PFCs are urgently needed since various homologs and isomers of PFCs are detected at trace levels (ng g(-1) or mu g L-1) in environment. At present, studies on analytical methods of trace PFCs in environmental samples have been extensively carried out in China and abroad. However, reviews which systematically discuss the sample pretreatment, analytical method, and matrix effect of determination of PFCs in complex environmental matrixes are hardly available. Therefore, the present review highlights the pretreatment methods, matrix effects, and detection techniques (especially isomers) of PFCs in environmental samples (water, sediment, sludge, soil and plant). It hopes that this review will provide valuable references for the environmental researches on PFCs.

TI Univariate predictors of maternal concentrations of environmental
   chemicals: The MIREC study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB Background: The developing fetus and pregnant woman can be exposed to a variety of environmental chemicals that may adversely affect their health. Moreover, environmental exposure and risk disparities are associated with different social determinants, including socioeconomic status (SES) and demographic indicators. Our aim was to investigate whether and how maternal concentrations of a large panel of persistent and non-persistent environmental chemicals vary according to sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics in a large pregnancy and birth cohort.
   Methods: Data were analyzed from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, a cohort of pregnant women (N = 2001) recruited over four years (2008-2011) in 10 cities across Canada. In all, 1890 urine and 1938 blood samples from the first trimester (1st and 3rd trimester for metals) were analysed and six sociodemographic and lifestyle indicators were assessed: maternal age, household income, parity, smoking status, country of birth and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI).
   Results: We found these indicators to be significantly associated with many of the chemicals measured in maternal blood and urine. Women born outside Canada had significantly higher concentrations of di-2-ethylhexyl and diethyl phthalate metabolites, higher levels of all metals except cadmium (Cd), as well as higher levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and legacy organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Nulliparity was associated with higher concentrations of dialkyl phosphates (DAPS), arsenic, dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and many of the persistent organic pollutants. Smokers had higher levels of bisphenol A, Cd and perfluorohexane sulfonate, while those women who had never smoked had higher levels of triclosan, DMAA, manganese and some OCPs.
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that inequitable distribution of exposure to chemicals among populations within a country can occur. Sociodemographic and lifestyle factors are an important component of a thorough risk assessment as they can impact the degree of exposure and may modify the individual's susceptibility to potential health effects due to differences in lifestyle, cultural diets, and aging.

TI Perfluorinated alkylated substances and brominated flame retardants in
   serum of the Czech adult population
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB Persistent organic pollutants, such as perfluorinated alkylated substances (PFASs) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are widespread in the environment and most of them are bioaccumulated in wildlife and humans. The present study is the first investigation to reveal the PFAS and BFR levels of serum samples in the adult population of the Czech Republic. Altogether, 300 serum samples from blood donors in four cities were examined. In all samples 19 PFASs and 33 BFRs, including some of their metabolites, were targeted. The analyses were performed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry or gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (according to the type of analyte). PFASs, with the carbon chain length C6 and higher, dominated in all samples. Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS; median: 2.43 ng/mL), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; median: 0.756 ng/mL), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA; median: 0.145 ng/mL) and perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS; median: 0.184 ng/mL) were detected in 100% of samples. Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA; median: 0.325 ng/mL) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA; median: 0.058 ng/mL) in 99.7% and 96.0% of samples, respectively.
   We observed statistically significant associations (p <0.05) between selected PFAS concentrations and the locality, gender, age of donors and education level. None of the BFRs was detected above the LOQ in more than 9% of the samples. The most frequently detected representatives of this group were congeners of polybrominated diphenyl ethers, namely BDE-47 (in 8.7%; range: 0.496-5.44 ng/g lipid weight (l.w.)), BDE-99 (in 6.0%; range: 0.706-9.46 ng/g l.w.), BDE-153 (in 7.3%; range: 0.736-6.44 ng/g l.w.) and BDE-209 (in 7.0%; range: 13.7-2693 ng/g l.w.).

   Results: Two patients with large skull base TGs mimicking CPA tumors clinically and radiographically were managed at the authors' institution. The first presented 4 years after MVD with asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss, multiple progressive cranial neuropathies, and brainstem edema due to a growing TG. Reoperation with resection of the granuloma confirmed a foreign-body reaction consisting of multinucleated giant cells containing intracytoplasmic Teflon particles. The second patient presented 11 years after MVD with asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss and recurrent hemifacial spasm. No growth was noted over 2 years, and the patient has been managed expectantly. Only one prior case of TG after MVD for hemifacial spasm has been reported in the English literature.
   Conclusions: TG is a rare complication of MVD for hemifacial spasm. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients presenting with a new-onset enhancing mass of the CPA after MVD, even when performed decades earlier. A thorough clinical and surgical history is critical toward establishing an accurate diagnosis to guide management and prevent unnecessary morbidity. Surgical intervention is not required unless progressive neurologic complications ensue.

   (CNTs)-Based Composite Membranes: A Review
SO MEMBRANES
AB Membrane separation technology is widely explored for various applications, such as water desalination and wastewater treatment, which can alleviate the global issue of fresh water scarcity. Specifically, carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-based composite membranes are increasingly of interest due to the combined merits of CNTs and membrane separation, offering enhanced membrane properties. This article first briefly discusses fabrication and growth mechanisms, characterization and functionalization techniques of CNTs, and then reviews the fabrication methods for CNTs-based composite membranes in detail. The applications of CNTs-based composite membranes in water treatment are comprehensively reviewed, including seawater or brine desalination, oil-water separation, removal of heavy metal ions and emerging pollutants as well as membrane separation coupled with assistant techniques. Furthermore, the future direction and perspective for CNTs-based composite membranes are also briefly outlined.

TI Fabrication of Micro/Nano Patterns on Polymeric Substrates Using Laser
   Ablation Methods to Control Wettability Behaviour: A Critical Review
SO REVIEWS OF ADHESION AND ADHESIVES
AB The fabrication of micro/nano patterned surfaces using femtosecond laser micromachining technique has emerged in recent years as a new method. This is due to its applicability to virtually all kinds of materials in an easy one-step process, which is scalable. Here we present a review of the effects of femtosecond laser ablation process parameters such as laser fluence, scan speed, and beam overlap on the fabricated patterns on various polymeric materials: PTFE, PLA, PMMA, PDMS, and medical grade-PVC. In addition, it presents the physical and chemical properties of fabricated microchannels. SEM, XPS, profilometry, and water contact angle measurments are used to characterize the surface chemical, morphological, and wetting properties. The surface morphology and thus the wetting properties can be altered by tuning the laser parameters. By introducing micro/nano roughness to the surface of hydrophobic polymers, extreme water repellency and superhydrophobicity is developed. Various applications of these fabricated superhydrophobic substrates in biomedical, packaging, fuel cells, low friction, self-cleaning are also discussed to a certain extent. Surfaces with superhydrophobic properties are mainly obtained by a combination of appropriate morphology at micro- and/or nanoscale and low surface energy material.

TI New Insights into Perfluorinated Sulfonic-Acid lonomers
SO CHEMICAL REVIEWS
AB In this comprehensive review, recent progress and developments on perfluorinated sulfonic-acid (PFSA) membranes have been summarized on many key topics. Although quite well investigated for decades, PFSA ionomers' complex behavior, along with their key role in many emerging technologies, have presented significant scientific challenges but also helped create a unique cross-disciplinary research field to overcome such challenges. Research and progress on PFSAs, especially when considered with their applications, are at the forefront of bridging electrochemistry and polymer (physics), which have also opened up development of state-of-the-art in situ characterization techniques as well as multiphysics computation models. Topics reviewed stem from correlating the various physical (e.g., mechanical) and transport properties with morphology and structure across time and length scales. In addition, topics of recent interest such as structure/transport correlations and modeling, composite PFSA membranes, degradation phenomena, and PFSA thin films are presented. Throughout, the impact of PFSA chemistry and side-chain is also discussed to present a broader perspective.

TI Exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances and thyroid function in pregnant
   women and children: A systematic review of epidemiologic studies
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Introduction: Thyroid hormones (THs) are especially important for brain maturation and development during the fetal period and childhood. Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and thyroid outcomes during the early stages of life. We aimed to review this evidence.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review in compliance with the PRISMA Statement (search conducted in PubMed and Embase, as well as in the citations of the selected articles). We chose studies if they dealt with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin (T4), or thyroid dysfunctions, and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measured in the blood of pregnant women and/or children up to 19 years old.
   Results: We included in this review three cross-sectional, one case-control, and six cohort studies (publication: 2011-2015), focusing on prenatal life (n = 7), childhood (n = 2) or both periods (n = 1). We observed a high degree of heterogeneity across studies in terms of sampling time (different gestational weeks, at birth, or childhood), outcomes, adjustment for potential confounders, and statistical approach. We found some evidence of a positive association between PFHxS and PFOS exposure and TSH levels measured in maternal blood, and PFNA and TSH levels measured in the blood of boys aged >= 11 years.
   Conclusion: Although there is a small number of studies with comparable data, we found some consistency of a positive association between maternal or teenage male exposure to some PFAS and TSH levels based on the current literature. However, further studies are required to confirm these possible relationships. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Impact of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery and Fast Track Surgery
   Pathways on Healthcare-associated Infections: Results From a Systematic
   Review and Meta-analysis
SO ANNALS OF SURGERY
AB Objective: The aim of this study was to establish if enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) and fast track surgery (FTS) protocols are associated with reduction in healthcare-associated infection (HAIs).
   Background: Evidence suggests that prevention strategies for HAIs should be multifaceted and transdisciplinary. ERAS and FTS protocols are collaborative approaches to perioperative care which reduce length of stay but may also be an effective strategy for reducing HAIs.
   Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials involving either ERAS or FTS for abdominal or pelvic surgery. Primary outcome included postoperative incidence of 3 major HAIs: lung infection (LI), urinary tract infection (UTI), and surgical site infection (SSI).
   Results: Among all included trials, ERAS/FTS was associated with a significant reduction in postoperative LI [risk ratio (RR) = 0.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-0.61; P < 0.0001; I-2 = 0%], UTI (RR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.23-0.76; P = 0.004; I-2 = 0%), and SSI (RR = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.58-0.98; P = 0.04; I-2 = 0%) compared with conventional controls. Sensitivity analysis performed following the exclusion of high risk of bias publications did not appreciably affect these results. ERAS/FTS was also associated with a significant decrease in hospital length of stay (standard mean difference = -0.83; 95% CI = -0.92 to -0.75; P < 0.0001; P for heterogeneity < 0.0001, I-2 = 93%). Subgroup analysis of trials involving colorectal surgery and open incision also resulted in significant reduction in all 3 HAIs among ERAS/FTS compared with conventional counterparts.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest ERAS/FTS protocols are powerful tools to prevent HAIs. Further study is needed to establish the mechanism. Providers should consider adoption of similar transdisciplinary programs to reduce perioperative HAIs and at the same time improve the value of surgical care.

TI Exposure to PFOA and PFOS and fetal growth: a critical merging of
   toxicological and epidemiological data
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY
AB Toxicological and epidemiological evidence on the association between perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and birth/fetal weight was assessed. An extensive search for toxicological information in rats and mice, and a systematic search for epidemiological evidence were conducted. The linear regression coefficient (LRC) of birth weight (BrthW) on PFOA/PFOS was considered, and separate random effects meta-analyses for untransformed (i.e. not mathematically transformed) and log-transformed values were performed.
   Toxicological evidence: PFOA: 12 studies (21 datasets) in mice showed statistically significant lower birth/fetal weights from 5mg/kg body weight per day. PFOS: most of the 13 studies (19 datasets) showed lower birth/fetal weights following in utero exposure.
   Epidemiological evidence: Sixteen articles were considered. The pooled LRC for a 1 ng/mL increase in untransformed PFOA (12 studies) in maternal plasma/serum was -12.8 g (95% CI -23.2; 2.4), and -27.1 g (95% CI - 50.6; -3.6) for an increase of 1 log(e) ng/mL PFOA (nine studies). The pooled LRC for untransformed PFOS (eight studies) was -0.92 g (95% CI - 3.4; 1.6), and for an increase of 1 log(e) ng/mL was -46.1(95% CI - 80.3; -11.9). No consistent pattern emerged for study location or timing of blood sampling.
   Conclusions: Epidemiological and toxicological evidence suggests that PFOA and PFOS elicit a decrease in BrthW both in humans and rodents. However, the effective animal extrapolated serum concentrations are 10(2)-10(3) times higher than those in humans. Thus, there is no quantitative toxicological evidence to support the epidemiological association, thus reducing the biological plausibility of a causal relationship.

TI Review-Identifying Critical Gaps for Polymer Electrolyte Water
   Electrolysis Development
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Although polymer electrolyte water electrolyzers (PEWEs) have been used in small-scale (kW to tens of kW range) applications for several decades, PEWE technology for hydrogen production in energy applications (power-to-gas,power-to-fuel, etc.) requires significant improvements in the technology to address the challenges associated with cost, performance and durability. Systems with power of hundreds of kW or even MWs, corresponding to hydrogen production rates of around 10 to 20 kg/h, have started to appear in the past 5 years. The thin (similar to 0.2 mm) polymer electrolyte in the PEWE with low ohmic resistance, compared to the alkaline cell with liquid electrolyte, allows operation at high current densities of 1-3 A/cm(2) and high differential pressure. This article, after an introductory overview of the operating principles of PEWE and state-of-the-art, discusses the state of understanding of key phenomena determining and limiting performance, durability, and commercial readiness, identifies important 'gaps' in understanding and essential development needs to bring PEWE science & engineering forward to prosper in the energy market as one of its future backbone technologies. For this to be successful, science, engineering, and process development as well as business and market development need to go hand in hand. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS.

TI The occurrence, exposure and risk assessment of perfluoroalkyl acids in
   food from mainland, China
SO FOOD ADDITIVES AND CONTAMINANTS PART A-CHEMISTRY ANALYSIS CONTROL
   EXPOSURE & RISK ASSESSMENT
AB To study the contamination of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in Chinese food and the risk of dietary exposure for the Chinese population, the data of 17 PFAAs covering 38 cities throughout China in 15 groups of foods were collected for meta-analysis from published and available research literature. Using food consumption and body weight parameters, estimated dietary intakes (EDIs) were calculated for evaluation using the Scenario-Based Risk Assessment (SceBRA) modelling. Among food groups, the highest sigma PFAAs concentrations and EDI contributions were both found in poultry (363ng/g), fish and shrimp (313ng/g), dark vegetables (309ng/g), fruits (116ng/g) and pork (25ng/g). The EDI of adults in the high-exposure scenario was about twice that of the intermediate-exposure scenario, while the EDI of children was about twice that of adults' EDI in the intermediate-exposure scenario. In addition, the PFOS EDI for children under high exposure approached its tolerable daily intake (TDI). Therefore high dietary exposure to PFAAs is giving rise to an increased health risk, especially for children.

TI Uptake and translocation of organic pollutants in plants: A review
SO JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB Organic pollutants, such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), antibiotics, herbicides, and bisphenol A (BPA), are commonly found in agricultural environments. They are released into the environment as a result of their use for human health purposes and farm management activities, and are often discharged as waste-water effluents. Most of these organic pollutants are taken up by plants through roots and leaves, and when they enter the tissue, they cause serious damage to the plants. Although the toxicity of organic pollutants to plants, especially to plant cells, has been intensively studied, a systematic review of these studies is lacking. Here we review researches on the toxicity of organic pollutants, their uptake, and translocation in plants. Our objective is to assemble existing knowledge concerning the interaction of organic pollutants with plants, which should be useful for the development of plant-based systems for removing pollutants from aquatic and agricultural environments.

TI Persistent organic pollutants in Pakistan: Potential threat to
   ecological integrities in terms of genotoxicity and oxidative stress
SO HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT
AB As a consequence of both increasing population and industrialization in agro-economic sector, Pakistan has inevitably been confronted by multicomplex environmental challenges. Owing in part to poor regulatory framework, pollution due to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has caused serious problems throughout the country. Resultantly, extensive use of POPs is causing vigorous deterioration of environment and human health. The current study addresses: (1) the general information on associated ecological effects and toxicity assessment by meta-analysis for local fauna and flora (2) their respective occurrence in living organisms; and (3) sources and distribution patterns of various POPs classes in environmental compartments of Pakistan. Based on the study, it can be concluded that the environment of Pakistan is highly contaminated with organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), dechlorane plus (DP), and polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), which is further supported with the meta-analysis. Nevertheless, unavailability of environmental quality standards and food safety for POPs render it a forthcoming challenge of multicompartment toxicity exposure. Therefore, strategies must be planned for risk assessment of biologically active POPs, while the POP waste inventory should be elevated, along with the necessary measures to promote appropriate handling and treatment of POP as a matter of prime importance.

AB User-authored annotations of data can support analysts in the activity of hypothesis generation and sensemaking, where it is not only critical to document key observations, but also to communicate insights between analysts. We present annotation graphs, a dynamic graph visualization that enables meta-analysis of data based on user-authored annotations. The annotation graph topology encodes annotation semantics, which describe the content of and relations between data selections, comments, and tags. We present a mixed-initiative approach to graph layout that integrates an analyst's manual manipulations with an automatic method based on similarity inferred from the annotation semantics. Various visual graph layout styles reveal different perspectives on the annotation semantics. Annotation graphs are implemented within C8, a system that supports authoring annotations during exploratory analysis of a dataset. We apply principles of Exploratory Sequential Data Analysis (ESDA) in designing C8, and further link these to an existing task typology in the visualization literature. We develop and evaluate the system through an iterative user-centered design process with three experts, situated in the domain of analyzing HCI experiment data. The results suggest that annotation graphs are effective as a method of visually extending user-authored annotations to data meta-analysis for discovery and organization of ideas.

TI Which Molecular Features Affect the Intrinsic Hepatic Clearance Rate of
   Ionizable Organic Chemicals in Fish?
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Greater knowledge of biotransformation rates for ionizable organic compounds (IOCs) in fish is required to properly assess the bioaccumulation potential of many environmentally relevant contaminants. In this study, we measured in vitro hepatic clearance rates for SO IOCs using a pooled batch of liver S9 fractions isolated from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The IOCs included four types of strongly ionized acids (carboxylates, phenolates, sulfonates, and sulfates), three types of strongly ionized bases (primary, secondary, tertiary amines), and a pair of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). Included in this test set were several surfactants and a series of beta-blockers. For linear alkyl chain IOC analogues, biotransformation enzymes appeared to act directly on the charged terminal group, with the highest clearance rates for tertiary amines and sulfates and no clearance of QACs. Clearance rates for C-12-IOCs were higher than those for C-8-IOC analogues. Several analogue series with multiple alkyl chains, branched alkyl chains, aromatic rings, and nonaromatic rings were evaluated. The likelihood of multiple reaction pathways made it difficult to relate all differences in clearance to specific molecular features the tested IOCs. Future analysis of primary metabolites in the S9 assay is recommended to further elucidate biotransformation pathways for IOCs in fish.

TI STING versus HIT technique of endoscopic treatment for vesicoureteral
   reflux: A systematic review and meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
CT 49th Annual Meeting of the Pacific-Association-of-Pediatric-Surgeons
CY APR 24-28, 2016
CL HI
SP Pacif Assoc Pediat Surg
AB Aim: Our study aimed to compare the efficacy of two endoscopic techniques used for the correction of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR): subureteral transurethral injection (STING) and hydrodistension implantation technique (HIT).
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, Google scholar, and Cochrane databases from 1984 to 2015. Meta-analysis of the selected studies was performed to compare the extent of reflux resolution following both techniques.
   Results: Six observational studies met the inclusion criteria for content. These comprised 632 ureters treated by STING and 895 ureters treated by HIT procedure. All included studies utilized dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (Deflux) as the bulking agent. The overall resolution of VUR was significantly higher in HIT (82.5%) compared to STING (71.4%) [ pooled odds ratio (OR) = 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.69; P < 0.0001; I-2= 8%]. A subgroup analysis showed that HIT had better outcomes than STING for both lower grade (I-III) [ OR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.23-0.82; P = 0.01; I-2= 0%] and high-grade VUR (IV-V) [OR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.20-0.91; P = 0.03; I-2= 0%]. However, there was no statistical difference in the requirement of additional injections between STING and HIT groups.
   Conclusion: HIT is superior to STING technique for resolution of VUR after Deflux injection. However, more randomized trials with longer follow-up are necessary to demonstrate the benefit of HIT compared to STING procedure. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Prevention of pelvic floor disorders: international urogynecological
   association research and development committee opinion
SO INTERNATIONAL UROGYNECOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Pelvic floor disorders (PFD), including urinary incontinence, anal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse, are common and have a negative effect on the quality of life of women. Treatment is associated with morbidity and may not be totally satisfactory. Prevention of PFDs, when possible, should be a primary goal. The purpose of this paper is to summarise the current literature and give an evidence-based review of the prevention of PFDs
   A working subcommittee from the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) Research and Development (R&D) Committee was formed. An initial document addressing the prevention of PFDs was drafted, based on a review of the English-language literature. After evaluation by the entire IUGA R&D Committee, revisions were made. The final document represents the IUGA R&D Committee Opinion on the prevention of PFDs.
   This R&D Committee Opinion reviews the literature on the prevention of PFDs and summarises the findings with evidence-based recommendations.
   Pelvic floor disorders have a long latency, and may go through periods of remission, thus making causality difficult to confirm. Nevertheless, prevention strategies targeting modifiable risk factors should be incorporated into clinical practice before the absence of symptomatology.

TI Altered organic matter dynamics in rivers and streams: ecological
   consequences and management implications
SO LIMNETICA
AB Scientists have spent decades measuring inputs, storage and breakdown of organic matter in freshwaters and have documented the effects of soil uses, pollution, climate warming or flow regulation on these pivotal ecosystem functions. Large-scale collaborative experiments and meta-analyses have revealed some clear patterns as well as substantial variability in detritus dynamics, and a number of standardized methods have been designed for routine monitoring of organic matter inputs, retention and breakdown in different conditions. Despite the knowledge gathered, scientists have been relatively ineffective at convincing managers of the importance of organic matter dynamics in freshwaters. Here we review the existing information of the role of organic matter as a) an element structuring freshwater habitats, b) a source or sink of nutrients, c) a food resource for heterotrophs, d) a source of pollution, e) a modulator of the fate of pollutants, f) a source of greenhouse gases, g) a potential source of environmental problems, and h) a diagnostic tool for ecosystem functioning. Current knowledge in some of these points is enough to be transferred to management actions, although has seldom been so. Some other points, such as the interactions between organic matter and emerging pollutants, offer interesting research questions.

TI Disruption of TCA Cycle and Glutamate Metabolism Identified by
   Metabolomics in an In Vitro Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
SO MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY
AB This study aims to develop a cellular metabolomics model that reproduces the pathophysiological conditions found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in order to improve knowledge of disease physiology. We used a co-culture model combining the motor neuron-like cell line NSC-34 and the astrocyte clone C8-D1A, with each over-expressing wild-type or G93C mutant human SOD1, to examine amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) physiology. We focused on the effects of mutant human SOD1 as well as oxidative stress induced by menadione on intracellular metabolism using a metabolomics approach through gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Preliminary non-supervised analysis by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that cell type, genetic environment, and time of culture influenced the metabolomics profiles. Supervised analysis using orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) on data from intracellular metabolomics profiles of SOD1(G93C) co-cultures produced metabolites involved in glutamate metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle. This study revealed the feasibility of using a metabolomics approach in a cellular model of ALS. We identified potential disruption of the TCA cycle and glutamate metabolism under oxidative stress, which is consistent with prior research in the disease. Analysis of metabolic alterations in an in vitro model is a novel approach to investigation of disease physiology.

TI Oxygen-Generating Biomaterials: A New, Viable Paradigm for Tissue
   Engineering?
SO TRENDS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB There have been many attempts to provide sufficient nutrients, especially oxygen, to engineered large tissues to overcome the effects of hypoxia or poor vascularization. Delivering sufficient oxygen to the transplanted cells is one of the most critical issues that affects cell survival and correct maturation of engineered tissues. An emerging approach is using 3D scaffolds made from oxygen-generating biomaterials to tackle transport limitations deep within the engineered tissues. This class of biomaterials has opened a new window for overcoming the challenges associated with ischemia occurring within large tissue constructs. This review critically assesses oxygen-generating reagents, the main approaches for developing oxygen-generating biomaterials, and their potential as 3D scaffolds for regenerative medicine in a clinical setting.

TI Environmental Chemicals in an Urban Population of Pregnant Women and
   Their Newborns from San Francisco
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Exposures to environmental pollutants in utero may increase the risk of adverse health effects. We measured the concentrations of 59 potentially harmful chemicals in 77 maternal and 65 paired umbilical cord blood samples collected in San Francisco during 2010-2011, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs), and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in serum and metals in whole blood. Consistent with previous studies, we found evidence that concentrations of mercury (Hg) and lower-brominated PBDEs were often higher in umbilical cord blood or serum than in maternal samples (median cord:maternal ratio > 1), while for most PFCs and lead (Pb), concentrations in cord blood or serum were generally equal to or lower than their maternal pair (median cord:maternal ratio <= 1). In contrast to the conclusions of a recent review, we found evidence that several PCBs and OCPs were also often higher in cord than maternal serum (median cord:maternal ratio > 1) when concentrations are assessed on a lipid-adjusted basis. Our findings suggest that for many chemicals, fetuses may experience higher exposures than their mothers and highlight the need to characterize potential health risks and inform policies aimed at reducing sources of exposure.

TI Is toxicant-induced Sertoli cell injury in vitro a useful model to study
   molecular mechanisms in spermatogenesis?
SO SEMINARS IN CELL & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Sertoli cells isolated from rodents or humans and cultured in vitro are known to establish a functional tight junction (TJ)-permeability barrier that mimics the blood-testis barrier (BTB) in vivo. This model has been widely used by investigators to study the biology of the TJ and the BTB. Studies have shown that environmental toxicants (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), bisphenol A (BPA) and cadmium) that exert their disruptive effects to induce Sertoli cell injury using this in vitro model are reproducible in studies in vivo. Thus, this in vitro system provides a convenient approach to probe the molecular mechanism(s) underlying toxicant-induced testis injury but also to provide new insights in understanding spermatogenesis, such as the biology of cell adhesion, BTB restructuring that supports preleptotene spermatocyte transport, and others. Herein, we provide a brief and critical review based on studies using this in vitro model of Sertoli cell cultures using primary cells isolated from rodent testes vs. humans to monitor environmental toxicant-mediated Sertoli cell injury. In short, recent findings have shown that environmental toxicants exert their effects on Sertoli cells to induce testis injury through their action on Sertoli cell actin-and/or microtubule-based cytoskeleton. These effects are mediated via their disruptive effects on actin-and/or microtubule-binding proteins. Sertoli cells also utilize differential spatiotemporal expression of these actin binding proteins to confer plasticity to the BTB to regulate germ cell transport across the BTB.

TI Breast cancer and persistent organic pollutants (excluding DDT): a
   systematic literature review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a group of heterogeneous compounds of both natural and anthropogenic origin with highly persistent and bioaccumulative properties. They cause a range of adverse effects to human health and the environment around the world. There is growing concern that POPs may increase breast cancer risk due to their xenoestrogenic properties. The aim of this systematic literature review is to summarize and integrate the risks of breast cancer following environmental exposure to POPs (other than DDT) from primary epidemiological studies published between 2006 and 2015. After searching various databases, 14 case-control studies and one cohort study were included. Evidence of an association between increased breast cancer risk and environmental exposure to these chemicals is inconsistent and inadequate to conclude with certainty. However, most of the studies have examined exposure to the pollutants after diagnosis of breast cancer, overlooking exposure during critical windows of vulnerability. They have also largely focused on individual chemicals but ignored the combined effects of different chemicals. Therefore, major data gaps remain in examining exposure during critical windows of vulnerability and assessing combined effects of multiple chemicals. Development of better exposure assessment methods addressing these gaps is required for future research.

TI Analytical strategies to the determination of metal-containing
   nanoparticles in environmental waters
SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Metal-containing nanoparticles (MNPs) represent emerging pollutants that still pose analytical challenges for their determination in environmentally relevant samples, including extremely low MNPs' concentrations, high colloidal background and the need to perform speciation analysis. Complementary to traditional state-of-the-art techniques evaluated elsewhere, this review additionally evaluates less conventional approaches for sample pretreatment, preconcentration, on- and offline detection, size characterisation and quantification of MNPs in environmental samples.
   Preconcentration techniques, like cloud point extraction and solid phase extraction, provide high preconcentration factors and recoveries. Electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry opens interesting perspectives in the still unresolved distinction between dissolved ions and nanoparticles. Combination of single particle ICP-MS with size fractionation techniques, like hydrodynamic chromatography or electrospray-differential mobility analysis, is highly promising for assessment of shape and structure related information of MNPs and their aggregates. Although highly relevant, the validation and production of reference materials and quantitative criteria on measurement certainty still require further development. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Consumer Product Chemicals in Indoor Dust: A Quantitative Meta-analysis
   of US Studies
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Indoor dust is a reservoir for commercial consumer product chemicals, including many compounds with known or suspected health effects. However, most dust exposure studies measure few chemicals in small samples. We systematically searched the U.S. indoor dust literature on phthalates, replacement flame retardants (RFRs), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), synthetic fragrances, and environmental phenols and estimated pooled geometric means (GMs), and 95% confidence intervals for 45 chemicals measured in >= 3 data sets. In order to rank and contextualize these results, we used the pooled GMs to calculate residential intake from dust ingestion, inhalation, and dermal uptake from air, and then identified hazard traits from the Safer Consumer Products Candidate Chemical List. Our results indicate that U.S. indoor dust consistently contains chemicals from multiple classes. Phthalates occurred in the highest concentrations, followed by phenols, RFRs, fragrance, and PFASs. Several phthalates and RFRs had the highest residential intakes. We also found that many chemicals, in dust share hazard traits such as reproductive and endocrine toxicity. We offer recommendations to maximize comparability of studies and advance indoor exposure science. This information is critical in shaping future exposure and health studies, especially related to cumulative exposures, and in providing evidence for intervention development and public policy.

TI Is Tibiofemoral or Patellofemoral Alignment or Trochlear Morphology
   Associated With Patellofemoral Osteoarthritis? A Systematic Review
SO ARTHRITIS CARE & RESEARCH
AB Objective. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the associations of knee alignment or trochlear morphology (measured on imaging) with presence, severity, onset, and/or progression of patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA).
   Methods. We prospectively registered our protocol with PROSPERO (International prospective register of systematic reviews) and followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to report this review. We searched 10 electronic databases, screened citing articles, and reviewed reference lists. We extracted data and evaluated methodologic quality. Due to study design heterogeneity, we used a best-evidence synthesis to summarize the evidence.
   Results. We included 16 publications (2,892 participants, 66% women) after removing 4 papers that did not meet our threshold for methodologic quality. There were 11 cross-sectional and 5 longitudinal papers. The target population was knee OA in 11 studies, PFOA in 2 studies, and other knee conditions in 3 studies. Alignment or morphology was measured using radiographs in 8 studies, magnetic resonance imaging in 7 studies, and computed tomography in 2 papers. Limitations include substantial heterogeneity in samples and methods, short followup times in longitudinal studies, and a small number of studies that specifically recruited participants with PFOA.
   Conclusion. There is strong evidence that PFOA is associated with both trochlear morphology and frontal plane knee alignment, while evidence is limited but consistent in the sagittal and axial planes. These findings suggest that alignment should be evaluated clinically in individuals with PFOA. Clinical interventions targeting knee alignment warrant further investigation.

TI Identification of Biomarkers of Exposure to FTOHs and PAPs in Humans
   Using a Targeted and Nontargeted Analysis Approach
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Although historic perfluorinated compounds are currently under scrutiny and growing regulatory control in the world, little is known about human exposure to other polyfluorinated compounds presently in use. Fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (PAPs) are known to degrade to terminal perfluorinated acids and toxic reactive intermediates through metabolic pathways. Therefore, it is important to characterize their human exposure by the identification of unique biomarkers. With the use of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-time-of-flight analysis (LC-MS-TOF), we developed a workflow for the identification of metabolites for the 8:2 FTOH and 8:2 diPAP. Analysis of serum and urine of dosed rats indicated the 8:2 FTOH sulfate and the 8:2 diPAP as potential biomarkers. These compounds, as well as 25 other fluorinated compounds and metabolites, were analyzed in human serum and urine samples from the general population (n = 100) and office workers (n = 30). The 8:2 FTOH sulfate was measured for the first time in human samples in 5 to 10% of the serum samples, ranging from 50 to 80 pg/mL. The 8:2 diPAP was measured in 58% of the samples, ranging from 100 to 800 pg/mL. This study indicates the FTOH sulfate conjugate as a biomarker of exposure to FTOHs and PAPs in humans.

TI Screening halogenated environmental contaminants in biota based on
   isotopic pattern and mass defect provided by high resolution mass
   spectrometry profiling
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB In the present work, we addressed the question of global seeking/screening organohalogenated compounds in a large panel of complex biological matrices, with a particular focus on unknown chemicals that may be considered as potential emerging hazards. A fishing strategy was developed based on untargeted profiling among full scan acquisition datasets provided by high resolution mass spectrometry. Since large datasets arise from such profiling, filtering useful information stands as a central question. In this way, we took advantage of the exact mass differences between Cl and Br isotopes. Indeed, our workflow involved an innovative Visual Basic for Applications script aiming at pairing features according to this mass difference, in order to point out potential organohalogenated clusters, preceded by an automated peak picking step based on the centWave function (xcms package of open access R programming environment). Then, H/Cl-scale mass defect plots were used to visualize the datasets before and after filtering. The filtering script was successfully applied to a dataset generated upon liquid chromatography coupled to ESI(-)-HRMS measurement from one eel muscle extract, allowing for realistic manual investigations of filtered clusters. Starting from 9789 initial obtained features, 1994 features were paired in 589 clusters. Hexabromocyclododecane, chlorinated paraffin series and various other compounds have been identified or tentatively identified, allowing thus broad screening of organohalogenated compounds in this extract. Although realistic, manual review of paired clusters remains time consuming and much effort should be devoted to automation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI QTL meta-analysis of root traits in Brassica napus under contrasting
   phosphorus supply in two growth systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A high-density SNP-based genetic linkage map was constructed and integrated with a previous map in the Tapidor x Ningyou7 (TNDH) Brassica napus population, giving a new map with a total of 2041 molecular markers and an average marker density which increased from 0.39 to 0.97 (0.82 SNP bin) per cM. Root and shoot traits were screened under low and 'normal' phosphate (Pi) supply using a 'pouch and wick' system, and had been screened previously in an agar based system. The P-efficient parent Ningyou7 had a shorter primary root length (PRL), greater lateral root density (LRD) and a greater shoot biomass than the P-inefficient parent Tapidor under both treatments and growth systems. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis identified a total of 131 QTL, and QTL meta-analysis found four integrated QTL across the growth systems. Integration reduced the confidence interval by similar to 41%. QTL for root and shoot biomass were co-located on chromosome A3 and for lateral root emergence were co-located on chromosomes A4/C4 and C8/C9. There was a major QTL for LRD on chromosome C9 explaining similar to 18% of the phenotypic variation. QTL underlying an increased LRD may be a useful breeding target for P uptake efficiency in Brassica.

TI Analysis of pulse propagation through multilayer plasmonic waveguides in
   the quasi-bound mode region
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a numerical analysis of surface plasmon dispersion and the nonlinear nature of wave propagation on different smooth waveguides with lossy noble metal films. We also analyze the effective parameters that can affect the dispersion behavior of a thin dielectric slab waveguide embedded in a symmetric metal film. Three kinds of metal (silver, gold, and copper) with Johnson-Christy constants have been utilized in waveguides. Four kinds of dielectric material (air, Teflon, FR-4, and silicon) have been employed in the insulator layer of the metal-insulatormetal waveguide. The dispersion curve of the metal-insulator-metal waveguide with different metal and dielectric arrangements has been studied numerically. By multi-nominal fitting of dispersion curves, we have derived the nonlinear properties of Gaussian (chirped) wave propagation, dispersion length, and pulse broadening through a three-layer plasmonic waveguide. A comparison of three-layered plasmonic waveguides with different guiding layers has been accomplished. Simulation results have shown that dispersion curves with a larger peak and a quasi-bound mode cause the Gaussian waves to be dispersed and broadened during longer traveling distances. The achieved results serve an impressive function in the design of optical switches and delay lines. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

TI Advanced nanocomposite membranes for fuel cell applications: a
   comprehensive review
SO BIOFUEL RESEARCH JOURNAL-BRJ
AB Combination of inorganic fillers into organic polymer membranes (organic-inorganic hybrid membranes) has drawn a significant deal of attention over the last few decades. This is because of the incorporated influence of the organic and inorganic phases towards proton conductivity and membrane stability, in addition to cost decline, improved water retention property, and also suppressing fuel crossover by increasing the transport pathway tortuousness. The preparation methods of the composite membranes and the intrinsic characteristics of the used particles as filler, such as size, type, surface acidity, shape, and their interactions with the polymer matrix can significantly affect the properties of the resultant matrix. The membranes currently used in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are perfluorinated polymers containing sulfonic acid, such as Nafion (R). Although these membranes possess superior properties, such as high proton conductivity and acceptable chemical, mechanical, and thermal stability, they suffer from several disadvantages such as water management, CO poisoning, and fuel crossover. Organic-inorganic nanocomposite PEMs offer excellent potentials for overcoming these shortcomings in order to achieve improved FC performance. Various inorganic fillers for the fabrication of composite membranes have been comprehensively reviewed in the present article. Moreover, the properties of polymer composites containing different nanoparticles have been thoroughly discussed. (C) 2016 BRTeam. All rights reserved.

TI Tunable filter Raman spectroscopy of purified semiconducting and
   metallic carbon nanotubes
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB Tunable filter Raman spectroscopy is used to efficiently produce Raman excitation maps of unpurified and type-purified single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Maps with fine excitation resolution (1 nm) are created over a wide wavelength range (727 to 980 nm), extending from metallic to semiconducting resonances. At a given wavelength, the wide bandwidth (> 3,000 cm(-1)) allows the comparison of the G band with the radial breathing mode (RBM), and shows the 2D band and other less prominent bands. Materials examined included unsorted powders, aqueous sorted semiconductors, aqueous sorted metals, and polyfluorene sorted semiconductors in toluene. The Raman excitation profiles of the G band are broad, relative to the RBM bands. The maps offer evidence of minority species contamination, except in the case of the polyfluorene sorted semiconductors. Tunable Raman spectroscopy data help validate the simpler fixed wavelength Raman spectroscopy approaches to purity assessment.

TI Fatty liver disease induced by perfluorooctane sulfonate: Novel insight
   from transcriptome analysis
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a hepato-toxicant and potential non-genotoxic carcinogen, was widely used in industrial and commercial products. Recent studies have revealed the ubiquitous occurrence of PFOS in the environment and in humans worldwide. The widespread contamination of PFOS in human serum raised concerns about its long-term toxic effects and its potential risks to human health. Using fatty liver mutant foie gras (fgr(-/-))/transport protein particle complex 11 (trappc11(-/-)) and PFOS-exposed wild-type zebrafish embryos as the study model, together with RNA sequencing and comparative transcriptomic analysis, we identified 499 and 1414 differential expressed genes (DEGs) in PFOS-exposed wild-type and trappc11 mutant zebrafish, respectively. Also, the gene ontology analysis on common deregulated genes was found to be associated with different metabolic processes such as the carbohydrate metabolic process, glycerol ether metabolic process, mannose biosynthetic process, de novo' (Guanosine diphosphate) GDP-L-fucose biosynthetic process, GDP-mannose metabolic process and galactose metabolic process. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis further highlighted that these deregulated gene clusters are closely related to hepatitis, inflammation, fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver cells, suggesting that PFOS can cause liver pathogenesis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in zebrafish. The transcriptomic alterations revealed may serve as biomarkers for the hepatotoxic effect of PFOS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Degradation and Removal Methods for Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl
   Substances in Water
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB Several perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been identified as chemicals of concern in the environment due to their persistence, global ubiquity, and classification as reproductive and developmental toxicants, endocrine disrupters, and possible carcinogens. Multiple PFASs are often found together in the environment due to product manufacturing methods and abiotic and biotic transformations. Treatment methods are needed to effectively sequester or destroy a variety of PFASs from groundwater, drinking water, and wastewater. This review presents a comprehensive summary of several categories of treatment approaches: (1) sorption using activated carbon, ion exchange, or other sorbents, (2) advanced oxidation processes, including electrochemical oxidation, photolysis, and photocatalysis, (3) advanced reduction processes using aqueous iodide or dithionite and sulfite, (4) thermal and nonthermal destruction, including incineration, sonochemical degradation, sub-or supercritical treatment, microwave-hydrothermal treatment, and high-voltage electric discharge, (5) microbial treatment, and (6) other treatment processes, including ozonation under alkaline conditions, permanganate oxidation, vitamin-B-12 and Ti(III) citrate reductive defluorination, and ball milling. Discussion of each treatment technology, including background, mechanisms, advances, and effectiveness, will inform the development of cost-effective PFAS remediation strategies based on environmental parameters and applicable methodologies. Further optimization of current technologies to analyze and remove or destroy PFASs below regulatory guidelines is needed. Due to the stability of PFASs, a combination of multiple treatment technologies will likely be required to effectively address real-world complexities of PFAS-mixtures and cocontaminants present in environmental matrices.

TI The water vapour continuum in near-infrared windows - Current
   understanding and prospects for its inclusion in spectroscopic databases
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY
AB Spectroscopic catalogues, such as GEISA and HITRAN, do not yet include information on the water vapour continuum that pervades visible, infrared and microwave spectral regions. This is partly because, in some spectral regions, there are rather few laboratory measurements in conditions close to those in the Earth's atmosphere; hence understanding of the characteristics of the continuum absorption is still emerging. This is particularly so in the near-infrared and visible, where there has been renewed interest and activity in recent years. In this paper we present a critical review focusing on recent laboratory measurements in two near-infrared window regions (centred on 4700 and 6300 cm(-1)) and include reference to the window centred on 2600 cm(-1) where more measurements have been reported. The rather few available measurements, have used Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTS), cavity ring down spectroscopy, optical-feedback - cavity enhanced laser spectroscopy and, in very narrow regions, calorimetric interferometry. These systems have different advantages and disadvantages. Fourier Transform Spectroscopy can measure the continuum across both these and neighbouring windows; by contrast, the cavity laser techniques are limited to fewer wavenumbers, but have a much higher inherent sensitivity. The available results present a diverse view of the characteristics of continuum absorption, with differences in continuum strength exceeding a factor of 10 in the cores of these windows. In individual windows, the temperature dependence of the water vapour self-continuum differs significantly in the few sets of measurements that allow an analysis. The available data also indicate that the temperature dependence differs significantly between different near-infrared windows. These pioneering measurements provide an impetus for further measurements. Improvements and/or extensions in existing techniques would aid progress to a full characterisation of the continuum - as an example, we report pilot measurements of the water vapour self-continuum using a supercontinuum laser source coupled to an FTS. Such improvements, as well as additional measurements and analyses in other laboratories, would enable the inclusion of the water vapour continuum in future spectroscopic databases, and therefore allow for a more reliable forward modelling of the radiative properties of the atmosphere. It would also allow a more confident assessment of different theoretical descriptions of the underlying cause or causes of continuum absorption. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Mechanochemical destruction of halogenated organic pollutants: A
   critical review
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Many tons of intentionally produced obsolete halogenated persistent organic pollutants (POPs), are stored worldwide in stockpiles, often in an unsafe manner. These are a serious threat to the environment and to human health due to their ability to migrate and accumulate in the biosphere. New technologies, alternatives to combustion, are required to destroy these substances, hopefully to their complete mineralization.
   In the last 20 years mechanochemical destruction has shown potential to achieve pollutant degradation, both of the pure substances and in contaminated soils. This capability has been tested for many halogenated pollutants, with various reagents, and under different milling conditions. In the present paper, a review of the published work in this field is followed by a critique of the state of the art of POPs mechanochemical destruction and its applicability to full-scale halogenated waste treatment.

TI Pregnancy-Related Changes of Amino Acid and Acylcarnitine
   Concentrations: The Impact of Obesity
SO AJP REPORTS
AB Objective Our primary objective was to assess the difference in amino and fatty acid biomarkers throughout pregnancy in women with and without obesity. Interactions between biomarkers and obesity status for associations with maternal and fetal metabolic measures were secondarily analyzed.
   Methods Overall 39 women (15 cases, 24 controls) were enrolled in this study during their 15-to 20-weeks' visit at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. We analyzed 32 amino acid and acylcarnitine concentrations with tandem mass spectrometry for differences throughout pregnancy as well as among women with and without obesity (body mass index [BMI] >= 35, BMI < 25).
   Results There were substantial changes in amino acids and acylcarnitine metabolites between the second and third trimesters (nonfasting state) of pregnancy that were significant after correcting for multiple testing (p < 0.002). Examining differences by maternal obesity, C8: 1 (second trimester) and C2, C4-OH, C18: 1 (third trimester) were higher in women with obesity compared with women without obesity. Several metabolites were marginally (0.002 < p < 0.05) correlated with birth weight, maternal glucose, and maternal weight gain stratified by obesity status and trimester.
   Conclusions Understanding maternal metabolism throughout pregnancy and the influence of obesity is a critical step in identifying potential mechanisms that may contribute to adverse outcomes in pregnancies complicated by obesity.

TI Environmental pollutants and child health-A review of recent concerns
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB In recent years, many new studies have evaluated associations between environmental pollutants and child health. This review aims to provide a broad summary of this literature, comparing the state of epidemiological evidence for the effects of a wide range of environmental contaminants (air pollutants, heavy metals, organochlorine compounds, perfluoroallcyl substances, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, pesticides, phthalates and bisphenol A) on child health outcomes. The review addresses effects on foetal growth and prematurity, neurodevelopment, respiratory and immune health, and childhood growth and obesity.
   Findings of recent prospective studies and meta-analyses have corroborated previous good evidence, often at lower exposure levels, for effects on foetal growth of air pollution and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), for neurotoxic effects of lead, methylmercury, PCBs and organophosphate pesticides, and for respiratory health effects of air pollution. Moderate evidence has emerged for a potential role of environmental pollutants in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism (lead, PCBs, air pollution), respiratory and immune health (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene - DDE - and PCBs), and obesity (DDE). In addition, there is now moderate evidence that certain chemicals of relatively recent concern may be associated with adverse child health outcomes, specifically perfluorooctanoate and foetal growth, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers and neurodevelopment. For other chemicals of recent concern, such as phthalates and bisphenol A, the literature is characterised by large inconsistencies preventing strong conclusions.
   In conclusion, since most of the recent literature evaluates common exposures in the general population, and not particularly high exposure situations, this accumulating body of evidence suggests that the unborn and young child require more protection than is currently provided. Large, coordinated research efforts are needed to improve understanding of long-term effects of complex chemical mixtures. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals and Reproductive Health
SO JOURNAL OF MIDWIFERY & WOMENS HEALTH
AB This review discusses the evidence linking industrial chemicals to a variety of health and reproductive outcomes. Industrial chemical production has increased over the past 30 to 40 years. Basic science, animal models, and epidemiologic data suggest that certain chemicals may act as endocrine disruptors (substances that interfere with normal hormonal action) and may play an etiologic role in a number of conditions whose incidence has also increased during this same period. These include low birth weight, gestational diabetes, obesity, certain cancers, certain birth defects, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit disorder and autism. In addition, some environmental chemicals may have epigenetic effects, resulting in transgenerational health impacts. The epidemiologic and experimental evidence that links chemicals such as plasticizers (eg, phthalates and phenols), flame retardants, perfluorinated compounds, and pesticides with adverse reproductive health outcomes is reviewed. Women's health care providers are the liaison between scientific research and their patients; they should educate themselves on the significance of environmental toxins to health. They are ideally positioned, not only to counsel and reassure pregnant women, but also to suggest practicable changes in dietary and lifestyle habits to improve their health. Furthermore, women's health care providers should advocate for regulatory changes that protect women and their families from the health effects of environmental toxins.

However, only a few strict anaerobes have been discovered to produce them and their production is limited to low concentrations because of product toxicity. Therefore, a bacterial strain capable of producing high-titer C5-C8 carboxylic acids was strategically isolated and characterized for production of medium chain length carboxylic acids.
   Results: Hexanoic acid-producing anaerobes were isolated from the inner surface of a cattle rumen sample. One of the isolates, displaying the highest hexanoic acid production, was identified as Megasphaera sp. MH according to 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Megasphaera sp. MH metabolizes fructose and produces various medium-chain carboxylic acids, including hexanoic acid, in low concentrations. The addition of acetate to the fructose medium as an electron acceptor increased hexanoic acid production as well as cell growth. Supplementation of propionate and butyrate into the medium also enhanced the production of C5-C8 medium-chain carboxylic acids. Megasphaera sp. MH produced 5.7 g L-1 of pentanoic acid (C5), 9.7 g L-1 of hexanoic acid (C6), 3.2 g L-1 of heptanoic acid (C7) and 1.2 g L-1 of octanoic acid (C8) in medium supplemented with C2-C6 carboxylic acids as the electron acceptors. This is the first report on the production of high-titer heptanoic acid and octanoic acid using a pure anaerobic culture.
   Conclusion: Megasphaera sp. MH metabolized fructose for the production of C2-C8 carbon-chain carboxylic acids using various electron acceptors and achieved a high-titer of 9.7 g L-1 and fast productivity of 0.41 g L-1 h(-1) for hexanoic acid. However, further metabolic activities of Megaspahera sp. MH for C5-C8 carboxylic acids production must be deciphered and improved for industrially relevant production levels.

TI Organic Contaminants in Chinese Sewage Sludge: A Meta-Analysis of the
   Literature of the Past 30 Years
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The production of sewage sludge is increasing in China but with unsafe disposal practices, causing potential risk to human health and the environment. Using literature from the past 30 years (N = 159), we conducted a meta-analysis of organic contaminants (OCs) in Chinese sludge. Most data were available from developed and populated regions, and no data were found for Tibet. Since 1987, 35 classes of chemicals consisting of 749 individual compounds and 1 mixture have been analyzed, in which antibiotics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were the most targeted analytes. For 13 classes of principal OCs (defined as chemicals detected in over five studies) in sludge, the median (expressed in nanograms per gram dry weight) was the highest for phthalate esters (27 900), followed by alkylphenol polyethoxylates (12 000), synthetic musks (5800), antibiotics (4240), PAHs (3490), ultraviolet stabilizers (670), bisphenol analogs (160), organochlorine pesticides (110), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (100), pharmaceuticals (84), hormones (69), perfluorinated compounds (21), and polychlorinated biphenyls (15). Concentrations of PAHs in sludges collected between 1998 and 2012 showed a decreasing trend. Study findings suggest the need for a Chinese national sewage sludge survey to identify and regulate toxic OCs, ideally employing both targeted as well as nontargeted screening approaches.

TI The History, Status, Gaps, and Future Directions of Neurotoxicology in
   China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB BACKGROUND: Rapid economic development in China has produced serious ecological, environmental, and health problems. Neurotoxicity has been recognized as a major public health problem. The Chinese government, research institutes, and scientists conducted extensive studies concerning the source, characteristics, and mechanisms of neurotoxicants.
   OBJECTIVES: This paper presents, for the first time, a comprehensive history and review of major sources of neurotoxicants, national bodies/legislation engaged, and major neurotoxicology research in China.
   METHODS: Peer-reviewed research and pollution studies by Chinese scientists from 1991 to 2015 were examined. PubMed, Web of Science and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were the major search tools.
   RESULTS: The central problem is an increased exposure to neurotoxicants from air and water, food contamination, e-waste recycling, and manufacturing of household products. China formulated an institutional framework and standards system for management of major neurotoxicants. Basic and applied research was initiated, and international cooperation was achieved. The annual number of peer-reviewed neurotoxicology papers from Chinese authors increased almost 30-fold since 2001.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite extensive efforts, neurotoxicity remains a significant public health problem. This provides great challenges and opportunities. We identified 10 significant areas that require major educational, environmental, governmental, and research efforts, as well as attention to public awareness. For example, there is a need to increase efforts to utilize new in vivo and in vitro models, determine the potential neurotoxicity and mechanisms involved in newly emerging pollutants, and examine the effects and mechanisms of mixtures. In the future, we anticipate working with scientists worldwide to accomplish these goals and eliminate, prevent and treat neurotoxicity.

TI Exposure to organochlorine pesticides and non-Hodgkin lymphoma: a
   meta-analysis of observational studies
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Growing evidence indicates that exposure to organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) could increase non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) risk. However, results from epidemiological studies investigating this association remain controversial. We thus conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the association between OCP exposure and NHL risk. Relevant publications were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase and identified according to the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies (6 nested case-control, 1 case-cohort, and 6 case-control) were selected for this meta-analysis. We used odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate the relationship between OCPs exposure and NHL risk. The summary OR for included studies was 1.40 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.56). No overall significant heterogeneity in the OR was observed (P-h = 0.253, I-2 = 12.6%). Furthermore, OR estimates in subgroup analyses were discussed, and strong associations were observed for dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE, OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.66), hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH, OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.87), chlordane (OR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.48), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB, OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.99). This meta-analysis had suggested that total OCPs of interest was significantly positively associated with NHL risk.

TI The developmental effects of pentachlorophenol on zebrafish embryos
   during segmentation: A systematic view
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a typical toxicant and prevailing pollutant whose toxicity has been broadly investigated. However, previous studies did not specifically investigate the underlying mechanisms of its developmental toxicity. Here, we chose zebrafish embryos as the model, exposed them to 2 different concentrations of PCP, and sequenced their entire transcriptomes at 10 and 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf). The sequencing analysis revealed that high concentrations of PCP elicited systematic responses at both time points. By combining the enrichment terms with single genes, the results were further analyzed using three categories: metabolism, transporters, and organogenesis. Hyperactive glycolysis was the most outstanding feature of the transcriptome at 10 hpf. The entire system seemed to be hypoxic, although hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1 alpha) may have been suppressed by the upregulation of prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs). At 24 hpf, PCP primarily affected somitogenesis and lens formation probably resulting from the disruption of embryonic body plan at earlier stages. The proposed underlying toxicological mechanism of PCP was based on the crosstalk between each clue. Our study attempted to describe the developmental toxicity of environmental pollutants from a systematic view. Meanwhile, some features of gene expression profiling could serve as markers of human health or ecological risk.

TI Mitigation of the Effects of Condensate Banking: A Critical Review
SO SPE PRODUCTION & OPERATIONS
AB With production from gas/condensate reservoirs, the flowing bottomhole pressure of the production well decreases. When the flowing bottomhole pressure decreases below the dewpoint, condensate accumulates near the wellbore region and forms a condensate bank. This results in a loss of productivity of both gas and condensate, which becomes more serious in intermediate-and low-permeability gas/condensate reservoirs, where the condensate bank reduces both the gas permeability and the well productivity.
   Several techniques have been used to mitigate this problem. These methods include:
   Use of solvents and wettability-alteration chemicals to reduce the impact of condensate blockage
   Gas cycling and injection of nitrogen and supercritical carbon dioxide as pressure-maintenance methods
   Drilling horizontal wells, hydraulic fracturing, and acidizing to improve the well productivity
   Gas cycling aims to keep the reservoir pressure greater than the dewpoint pressure to reduce the condensation phenomena. The limited volumes of gas that can be recycled in the reservoir can hinder the application of this method. For an ideal gas-cycling process, the volume of the gas injected into the reservoir will be larger than the total gas that can be produced from such a reservoir. Other approaches are the drilling of horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing, during which the pressure drop around the wellbore region is lowered to allow for a longer production time, with only single-phase gas flow to the wellbore. These approaches are costly because they require drilling rigs. Another technique is the use of solvents, which shows good treatment outcomes, but the durability is a questionable issue in these treatments. Moreover, wettability alteration needs to be approached very carefully so as not to cause permanent damage to the reservoir. The use of fluorinated polymers and surfactants dissolved in alcohol-based solvents for wettability-alteration treatments was reported in many studies.
   Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, and can be applied under certain conditions. This paper presents all of these methods, along with their advantages and disadvantages and description of some of their field applications and case studies.

TI Fluorinated methacrylamide chitosan hydrogels enhance collagen synthesis
   in wound healing through increased oxygen availability
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB In this study, methacrylamide chitosan modified with perfluorocarbon chains (MACF) is used as the base material to construct hydrogel dressings for treating dermal wounds. MACF hydrogels saturated with oxygen (+O-2) are examined for their ability to deliver and sustain oxygen, degrade in a biological environment, and promote wound healing in an animal model. The emerging technique of metabolomics is used to understand how MACF + O-2 hydrogel dressings improve wound healing. Results indicate that MACF treatment facilitates oxygen transport rate that is two orders of magnitude greater than base MAC hydro gels. MACF hydrogel dressings are next tested in an in vivo splinted rat excisional wound healing model. Histological analysis reveals that MACF + O-2 dressings improve re-epithelialization (p < 0.0001) and synthesis of collagen over controls (p < 0.01). Analysis of endogenous metabolites in the wounds using global metabolomics demonstrates that MACF + O-2 dressings promotes a regenerative metabolic process directed toward hydroxyproline and collagen synthesis, with confirmation of metabolite levels within this pathway. The results of this study confirm that increased oxygen delivery through the application of MACF + O-2 hydrogels enhances wound healing and metabolomics analyses provides a powerful tool to assess wound healing physiology.
   Statement of Significance
   This work presents the first application of a novel class of oxygen delivering biomaterials (methacrylamide chitosan modified with perfluorocarbon chains (MACF)) as a hydrogel wound dressing. This manuscript also contains strong focus on the biochemical benefits of MACF dressings on underlying mechanisms vital to successful wound healing. In this vein, this manuscript presents the application of applied metabolomics (tandem mass spectroscopy) to uncover biomaterial interactions with wound healing mechanisms. We believe the approaches described in this manuscript will be of great interest to biomedical scientists and particularly to researchers studying wound healing, metabolomics, applied biomaterials and regenerative medicine.

TI Properties, performance and associated hazards of state-of-the-art
   durable water repellent (DWR) chemistry for textile finishing
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Following the phase-out of long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), the textile industry had to find alternatives for side-chain fluorinated polymer based durable water repellent (DWR) chemistries that incorporated long perfluoroalkyl side chains. This phase-out and subsequent substitution with alternatives has resulted in a market where both fluorinated and non-fluorinated DWRs are available. These DWR alternatives can be divided into four broad groups that reflect their basic chemistry: side-chain fluorinated polymers, silicones, hydrocarbons and other chemistries (includes dendrimer and inorganic nanoparticle chemistries). In this critical review, the alternative DWRs are assessed with regards to their structural properties and connected performance, loss and degradation processes resulting in diffuse environmental emissions, and hazard profiles for selected emitted substances. Our review shows that there are large differences in performance between the alternative DWRs, most importantly the lack of oil repellence of non-fluorinated alternatives. It also shows that for all alternatives, impurities and/or degradation products of the DWR chemistries are diffusively emitted to the environment. Our hazard ranking suggests that hydrocarbon based DWR is the most environmentally benign, followed by silicone and side-chain fluorinated polymer-based DWR chemistries. Industrial commitments to reduce the levels of impurities in silicone based and side-chain fluorinated polymer based DWR formulations will lower the actual risks. There is a lack of information on the hazards associated with DWRs, in particular for the dendrimer and inorganic nanoparticle chemistries, and these data gaps must be filled. Until environmentally safe alternatives, which provide the required performance, are available our recommendation is to choose DWR chemistry on a case-by-case basis, always weighing the benefits connected to increased performance against the risks to the environment and human health.

TI C8-T1 Radiculopathy Due to an Intradural Extramedullary Metastasis of a
   Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor Case Report and Review of the Literature
SO PANCREAS
AB Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) are usually well-to-moderately differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) that most often metastasize to the liver and lymph nodes with other locations being uncommon. We present a case of intradural pNET metastasis and conduct a review of the literature. Forty-five cases, including the case presently reported, of spinal cord compression due to well-differentiated NETs were found: carcinoid (80%), pNET (13.3%), and NETs of unknown primary (6.7%). Seventy-eight percent of cases consisted of extradural compressions from vertebral bone metastases, whereas there were only 5 cases of intradural extramedullary spinal cord compression. Most cases were managed with surgery and/or radiotherapy with a good clinical outcome in the majority. We report the first case of a pNET intradural extramedullary metastasis and conduct the largest review to date of an infrequent complication of well-differentiated NETs such as malignant spinal cord compression. Aggressive local treatment is warranted in most cases because it usually achieves neurologic improvement and symptomatic relief in patients who may still have a long life expectancy.

TI Profiling of urinary amino-carboxylic metabolites by in-situ
   heptafluorobutyl chloroformate mediated sample preparation and gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB A novel 1,1,1,2,2,3,3-heptafluorobutyl chloroformate reagent (HFBCF) was examined for in-situ derivatization of amino-carboxylic metabolites in human urine. The arising reaction products exhibit greatly reduced polarity which facilitates combining the derivatization and liquid-liquid microextraction (LLME) from an aqueous urine into an isooctane phase and immediate gas chromatographic-mas spectrometric analysis (GC-MS). The sample preparation protocol is simple, proceeds without an alcohol excess and provides cleaner extracts than other urinary GC-MS based methods. Moreover, thiol metabolites bound in disulfide bonds can be released by reduction with tris(3-hydroxypropyl)phosphine (THP) prior to the developed derivatization and LLME step. In order to evaluate potential of the novel method for GC-MS metabolomics, reaction products of 153 urinary metabolites with HFBCF, particularly those possessing amino and carboxyl groups (56 amino acids and their conjugates, 84 organic acids, 9 biogenic amines, 4 other polar analytes) and two internal standards were investigated in detail by GC-MS and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). One hundred and twenty metabolites (78%) yielded a single product, 25 (16%) and 2 metabolites (2-methylcitrate, citrate) generated two and more derivatives. From the examined set, analytically applicable products of 5 metabolites were not detected; the derivatives of 3 metabolites were only suitable for LC-MS analysis. Electron ionization (El) of the examined analytes contained characteristic, diagnostic ions enabling to distinguish related and isomeric structures. The new method was validated for 132 metabolites using two internal standards in artificial urine and with special attention to potential disease biomarker candidates. The developed sample preparation protocol was finally evaluated by means of a certified organic acid standard mixture in urine and by GC-MS analysis of 100 morning urines obtained from healthy patients (50 males and 50 females), where 112 physiological metabolites were quantified in a 25 mu L sample aliquot. The quantification data for the set were satisfactory, most metabolites were found within the range reported in the reference human metabolome (HMDB) database and literature. The reported results suggest that the described method has been a novel promising tool for targeted GC-MS based metabolomic analysis in urine. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A critical review of perfluorooctanoate and perfluorooctanesulfonate
   exposure and immunological health conditions in humans
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY
AB Whether perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), two widely used and biopersistent synthetic chemicals, are immunotoxic in humans is unclear. Accordingly, this article systematically and critically reviews the epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFOA and PFOS and various immune-related health conditions in humans. Twenty-four epidemiologic studies have reported associations of PFOA and/or PFOS with immune-related health conditions, including ten studies of immune biomarker levels or gene expression patterns, ten studies of atopic or allergic disorders, five studies of infectious diseases, four studies of vaccine responses, and five studies of chronic inflammatory or autoimmune conditions (with several studies evaluating multiple endpoints). Asthma, the most commonly studied condition, was evaluated in seven studies. With few, often methodologically limited studies of any particular health condition, generally inconsistent results, and an inability to exclude confounding, bias, or chance as an explanation for observed associations, the available epidemiologic evidence is insufficient to reach a conclusion about a causal relationship between exposure to PFOA and PFOS and any immune-related health condition in humans. When interpreting such studies, an immunodeficiency should not be presumed to exist when there is no evidence of a clinical abnormality. Large, prospective studies with repeated exposure assessment in independent populations are needed to confirm some suggestive associations with certain endpoints.

TI Similar Microbial Consortia and Genes Are Involved in the Biodegradation
   of Benzalkonium Chlorides in Different Environments
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) are emerging pollutants. Identification of microorganisms and the genes involved in the biodegradation of BACs is crucial for better understanding the fate of BACs in the environment and developing treatment strategies. Four microbial communities degrading BACs were developed from sewage (SEW), activated sludge (AS), soil (SOIL) and sea sediment (SEA) samples. According to 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and shotgun metagenome sequencing analyses, the most abundant species represented uncharacterized members of the Pseudomonas and Achromobacter genera. BAC biotransformation rates of the enriched microbial communities were 2.8,3.2, 17.8, and 24.3 mu M hr(-1) for SEA, AS, SOIL, and SEW, respectively, and were positively correlated with the relative abundance of a particular Pseudomonas sp. strain, BIOMIG1. The strain BIOMIG1 mineralizes BACs at a rate up to 2.40 mu mol hr(-1) 10(-11) cells. Genomes of four BAC degrading and nondegrading BIOMIG1 phenotypes were sequenced and differentially compared with each other. As a result, a gene cluster encoding for transporters, an integrase and a dioxygenase were involved in BAC biotransformation. Our results suggest that BIOMIG1 plays a key role on the fate of BACs in the environment and genes, other than those reported to date, are involved in BAC biotransformation in various habitats.

TI Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation Versus Reverse Less Invasive
   Stabilization System-distal Femur for Treating Proximal Femoral
   Fractures A Meta-analysis
SO MEDICINE
AB The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of 2 surgical techniques that are used to treat proximal femoral fractures.
   A systematic literature search (up to December 2014) was conducted in Medline, Embase, PubMed, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to screen for studies comparing proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) with less invasive stabilization system-distal femur (LISS-DF) for proximal femoral fractures. Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies and extracted data. Surgical information and postoperative outcomes were analyzed.
   A total of 7 studies with 361 patients who satisfied the eligibility criteria included 3 randomized controlled trials and 4 case-controlled trials associated with PFNA versus LISS in treating proximal femoral fractures. Our results demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in hospital stay and time to weight-bearing ambulation and bone healing for PFNA compared with LISS (odds ratio [OR] -1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.92 to -0.05; OR -7.08, 95% CI -8.32 to -5.84; OR -2.71, 95% CI -4.76 to 0.67). No statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups for operative time, blood loss volume, Harris hip score, and incidence of complications.
   Based on the results of this analysis, we inferred that PFNA is safer and more effective than reverse LISS-DF in patients undergoing osteosynthesis for proximal femoral fractures, and that PFNA is associated with reduced hospital stays and reduced time to weight-bearing ambulation and bone healing. Nonetheless, in certain cases in which PFNA is not suitable due to abnormal structure of the proximal femur or particularly unstable fractures, the LISS plate technique could be a useful alternative.

TI PHARMACEUTICALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT-GLOBAL OCCURRENCES AND PERSPECTIVES
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB Pharmaceuticals are known to occur widely in the environment of industrialized countries. In developing countries, more monitoring results have recently become available, but a concise picture of measured environmental concentrations (MECs) is still elusive. Through a comprehensive literature review of 1016 original publications and 150 review articles, the authors collected MECs for human and veterinary pharmaceutical substances reported worldwide in surface water, groundwater, tap/drinking water, manure, soil, and other environmental matrices in a comprehensive database. Due to the heterogeneity of the data sources, a simplified data quality assessment was conducted. The database reveals that pharmaceuticals or their transformation products have been detected in the environment of 71 countries covering all continents. These countries were then grouped into the 5 regions recognized by the United Nations (UN). In total, 631 different pharmaceutical substances were found at MECs above the detection limit of the respective analytical methods employed, revealing distinct regional patterns. Sixteen substances were detected in each of the 5 UN regions. For example, the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac has been detected in environmental matrices in 50 countries, and concentrations found in several locations exceeded predicted no-effect concentrations. Urban wastewater seems to be the dominant emission pathway for pharmaceuticals globally, although emissions from industrial production, hospitals, agriculture, and aquaculture are important locally. The authors conclude that pharmaceuticals are a global challenge calling for multistakeholder approaches to prevent, reduce, and manage their entry into and presence in the environment, such as those being discussed under the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management, a UN Environment Program.

TI Remote Control by pi-Conjugation of the Emissive Properties of Fischer
   Carbene-BODIPY Dyads
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The synthesis, structure, and complete characterization of mono- and bimetallic dyads joining Fischer carbene complexes and BODIPY chromophores, are reported. In these organometallic species, the Fischer carbene complex is attached to the BODIPY moiety through a p-aminophenyl group linked at the C8 carbon atom of the BODIPY core. The photophysical properties, namely the corresponding UV/vis absorption and emission spectra of these new metal-carbene complexes, are analyzed and discused. It is found that whereas the absorption of the considered dyads strongly resembles that of the parent 4-anilinyl-substituted BODIPY, the fluorescence emission is significantly reduced in these species, very likely as a result of a Forster-type energy transfer mechanism. At variance, the replacement of the pentacarbonyl-metal(0) fragment by a carbonyl group leads to high fluorescence emission intensity. In: addition, the emissive properties of the BODIPY core in these organometallic dyads can be tuned by remote groups by means of pi-conjugation, as supported by density functional theory calculations.

TI In utero perfluorooctane sulfonate exposure causes low body weights of
   fetal rats: A mechanism study
SO PLACENTA
AB Objectives: The objective of the present study is to investigate the mechanism of perfluorooctane sulfonate-induced low body weight of fetus by analysis of glucocorticoid metabolizing enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 and gene expression profiling of the placenta after in utero PFOS exposure.
   Study design: Pregnant Sprague-Dawley dams were gavaged with 0, 5, and 20 mg/kg body weight PFOS daily from gestational day 12-18. On gestational day 18, pregnant dams were euthanized, placentas, and fetuses were collected.
   Main outcome measures: Body weights of fetuses and placentas were measured, the corticosterone levels in fetal serum, and 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 as well as the placental gene profiling were analyzed.
   Results: 20 mg/kg PFOS significantly reduced fetal body weight and placental weight. Both 5 and 20 mg/kg PFOS increased fetal serum corticosterone levels. PFOS potently inhibited placental 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 activity. Of 21,910 genes, 45 genes were significantly downregulated >= 2 fold by 20 mg/1<g PFOS, including extracellular matrix (Slpi and Pi16), growth factors and hormones (Trh and Pdf), ion transporters (Aqp1, S100a4, and Abp1), signal transducers (Kap and Ampd3), and structural constituents (A2m and Des).
   Conclusions: PFOS exposure may alter placental development and function, causing intrauterine growth restriction via inhibiting placental 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Lacking evidence for performance of implants used for proximal femoral
   fractures - A systematic review
SO INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
AB Introduction: Evaluation of the long-term performance of implants used in trauma surgery relies on post-marked clinical studies since no registry based implant assessment exists. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the evidence of performance of implants currently used for treating proximal femoral fractures (PFF) in Denmark.
   Method: PubMed was searched for clinical studies on primary PFF with follow-up >= 12 months, reporting implant-related failure and evaluating one of following: DHS, CHS, HipLoc, Gamma3, IMHS, InterTan, PFN, PFNA or PTN. Limits: English language and publication date after 1st of January 1990.
   Results: All studies were evidence level II or III. 30 publications for SHS were found: 13 of CHS, 15 of DHS and 2 of HipLoc. In total CHS was evaluated in 1110 patients (900 prospectively), DHS in 2486 (567 prospectively) and HipLoc in 251 (all prospectively). Fifty-four publications for nails were found: 13 of Gamma3, 7 of IMHS, 5 of InterTan, 10 of PFN, 24 of PFNA and 0 of PTN. In total Gamma3 was evaluated in 1088 patients (829 prospectively), IMHS in 1543 (210 prospectively), InterTan in 595 (585 prospectively), PFN in 716 (557 prospectively), PFNA in 1762 (1018 prospectively) and PTN in 0.
   Conclusions: The clinical evidence behind the current implants used for proximal femoral fractures is weak considering the number of implants used worldwide. Sporadic evaluation is not sufficient to identify long term problems. A systematic post market surveillance of implants used for fracture treatment, preferable by a national register, is necessary in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The diagnostic yield of transesophageal echocardiography in patients
   with cryptogenic cerebral ischaemia: a meta-analysis
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB Background and purposeThe diagnostic utility of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in patients with cryptogenic ischaemic stroke (IS) or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) remains controversial.
   MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA guidelines to estimate the pooled prevalence of potential cardioembolic causes detected by TEE in prospective observational studies of cryptogenic IS/TIA. Cardiac conditions causally associated with cerebral ischaemia were considered to be intramural thrombi and intracardiac tumors according to ASCO phenotyping of IS.
   ResultsThirty-five eligible studies, comprising 5772 patients (mean age 53.6 years, 56.9% men) were identified. The most common TEE finding was ascending aorta and/or aortic arch atheroma [51.2% (27.4%-74.5%)], followed by patent foramen ovale (PFO) [43.2% (36.3%-50.4%)]. Complex aortic plaques and large PFOs were reported in 14% (10.2%-18.9%) and 19.5% (16.6%-22.8%) of TEE evaluations. The prevalence of atrial septal aneurysm was 12.3% (7.9%-18.7%) and was significantly higher in conjunction with PFO presence (risk ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.63-2.54, P < 0.001). The prevalence of left atrial thrombus [3.0% (1.1%-8.3%)] and spontaneous echo contrast [3.8% (2.3%-6.2%)] was low. The prevalence of intracardiac tumors was extremely uncommon [0.2% (0%-0.7%)]. Significant heterogeneity was identified (I-2 > 60%) in the majority of analyses. Heterogeneity was not affected by cryptogenic stroke definition (TOAST versus alternative criteria). After dichotomizing available studies using a cut-off of 50 years, PFO was significantly (P = 0.001) more prevalent in younger than in older patients.
   ConclusionRoutine TEE in patients with cryptogenic IS/TIA commonly identifies abnormal findings. However, the prevalence of cardiac conditions considered to be causally associated with cerebral ischaemia (intracardiac thrombi and tumors) is low.

TI Meta-analysis of the laparoscopic versus open colorectal surgery within
   fast track surgery
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COLORECTAL DISEASE
AB Background Laparoscopic methods and fast-track surgery (FTS) can enhance recovery and reduce postoperative hospital stay. However, whether laparoscopic surgery can provide short-term benefits within FTS is controversial. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of published studies to evaluate the effect of laparoscopic colorectal surgery within FTS.
   Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Ovid databases for eligible studies. Endpoints were duration of postoperative hospital stay, time to first bowel movement, total postoperative complication rate, readmission rate, mortality within 30 days after surgery, and conversation rate of laparoscopic surgery.
   Results Four randomized controlled trials and six clinical controlled trials (1510 patients) were eligible for analyses. Duration of postoperative hospital stay (weighted mean difference, -1.65 days; p < 0.001), time to first bowel movement (-1.13 days; p < 0.001), total postoperative complication rate (risk ratio [RR], 0.65; p<0.001), readmission rate (0.46; p < 0.001), and mortality (0.45; p < 0.001) were significantly reduced in the laparoscopic surgery group. Overall conversion rate of laparoscopic surgery was 11.1 %. Subgroup analyses based on each FT element demonstrated that studies without the element "prevention of hypothermia," "no bowel preparation," or "no routine use of drains" did not show significant differences between two groups with regard to duration of postoperative hospital stay or total prevalence of postoperative complications.
   Conclusion Within FTS, laparoscopic methods can significantly shorten postoperative hospital stay, accelerate postoperative recovery, and enhance safety in colorectal surgery. The FT elements "prevention of hypothermia," "no bowel preparation," and "no routine use of drains" may play important parts in the combined effect of these two methods.

TI Research Review: Executive function deficits in fetal alcohol spectrum
   disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder - a meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
AB BackgroundAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like symptoms are common in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). FASD and ADHD groups both display executive function impairments; however, there is ongoing debate whether the pattern and magnitude of executive function deficits differs between these two types of disorders.
   MethodsAn electronic literature search was conducted (PubMed, PsychInfo; 1972-2013) to identify studies comparing the executive functioning of children with FASD with ADHD or control groups. FASD groups included those with and without dysmorphy (i.e., FAS, pFAS, ARND, and other FASD diagnoses). Effect sizes (Hedges' g, standardized mean difference) were calculated. Random effects meta-analytic models were performed using the metafor package for R.
   ResultsFifty-one studies met inclusion criteria (FASD N=2,115; ADHD N=453; controls N=1,990). Children with FASD showed the strongest and most consistent deficits in planning, fluency, and set-shifting compared to controls (Hedges' g=-0.94, -0.78) and children with ADHD (Hedges' g=-0.72, -0.32). FASD was associated with moderate to large impairments in working memory, compared to controls (Hedges' g=-.84, -.58) and small impairments relative to groups with ADHD (Hedges' g=-.26). Smaller and less consistent deficits were found on measures of inhibition and vigilance relative to controls (Hedges' g=-0.52, -0.31); FASD and ADHD were not differentiated on these measures. Moderator analyses indicated executive dysfunction was associated with older age, dysmorphy, and larger group differences in IQ. Sex and diagnostic system were not consistently related to effect size.
   ConclusionsWhile FASD is associated with global executive impairments, executive function weaknesses are most consistent for measures of planning, fluency, and set-shifting. Neuropsychological measures assessing these executive function domains may improve differential diagnosis and treatment of FASD.

TI Meta-analysis of lipid-traits in Hispanics identifies novel loci,
   population-specific effects, and tissue-specific enrichment of eQTLs
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We performed genome-wide meta-analysis of lipid traits on three samples of Mexican and Mexican American ancestry comprising 4,383 individuals, and followed up significant and highly suggestive associations in three additional Hispanic samples comprising 7,876 individuals. Genome-wide significant signals were observed in or near CELSR2, ZNF259/APOA5, KANK2/DOCK6 and NCAN/MAU2 for total cholesterol, LPL, ABCA1, ZNF259/APOA5, LIPC and CETP for HDL cholesterol, CELSR2, APOB and NCAN/MAU2 for LDL cholesterol, and GCKR, TRIB1, ZNF259/APOA5 and NCAN/MAU2 for triglycerides. Linkage disequilibrium and conditional analyses indicate that signals observed at ABCA1 and LIPC for HDL cholesterol and NCAN/MAU2 for triglycerides are independent of previously reported lead SNP associations. Analyses of lead SNPs from the European Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC) dataset in our Hispanic samples show remarkable concordance of direction of effects as well as strong correlation in effect sizes. A meta-analysis of the European GLGC and our Hispanic datasets identified five novel regions reaching genome-wide significance: two for total cholesterol (FN1 and SAMM50), two for HDL cholesterol (LOC100996634 and COPB1) and one for LDL cholesterol (LINC00324/CTC1/PFAS). The top meta-analysis signals were found to be enriched for SNPs associated with gene expression in a tissue-specific fashion, suggesting an enrichment of tissue-specific function in lipid-associated loci.

   urban waters A state-of-the-art review
SO MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB Purpose - Advancements in real-time water monitoring technologies permit rapid detection of water quality, and threats from waste loads. Water Framework Directive mandating the establishment of Member States' water resources monitoring, presence of hazardous contaminants in effluents, and perception of vulnerability of water distribution system to attacks, have spurred technical and economic interests. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - As alternative to traditional analyzers, chemosensors, operate according to physical principles, without sample collection (online), and are capable of supplying parameter values continuously and in real-time. Their low selectivity and stability issues have been overcome by technological developments. This review paper contains a comprehensive survey of existing and expected online monitoring technologies for measurement/detection of pollutants in water.
   Findings - The state-of-the-art in online water monitoring is presented. Application examples are reported. Monitoring costs will become a lesser part of a water utility budget due to the fact that automation and technological simplification will abate human cost factors, and reduce the complexity of laboratory procedures.
   Originality/value - An overview of applicable instrumentation, and forthcoming developments, is given. Technological development in this field is very rapid, and astonishing advances are anticipated in several areas (fingerprinting, optochemical sensors, biosensors, molecular techniques). Online monitoring is becoming an ever-important tool not only for compliance control or plant management purposes, but also as a useful approach to pollution control and reduction, minimizing the environmental impact of discharges.

TI To close or not to close: contemporary indications for patent foramen
   ovale closure
SO EXPERT REVIEW OF CARDIOVASCULAR THERAPY
AB Introduction: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a common congenital cardiac abnormality and that has been associated with several disease processes including transient ischemic attacks (TIA), stroke, migraine headaches with aura, decompression sickness, platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome, and shunt induced cyanosis. Controversy exists regarding closure of PFO as a therapeutic treatment modality for these disease processes. This review addresses the contemporary clinical indications for PFO closure.
   Areas covered: We conducted a comprehensive literature search of contemporary research studies focusing on randomized trials and meta-analyses comparing medical therapy and device closure of PFOs for the treatment of PFO associated clinical syndromes. We synthesized this literature into a review addressing indications for PFO closure in stroke, TIA, migraine headaches with aura, decompression sickness, platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome, and shunt induced cyanosis.
   Expert commentary: Because in many PFO associated conditions it can be difficult to determine the degree to which the PFO is a causative factor in the disease process, we recommend a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to exclude other obvious etiologies of PFO associated conditions before implicating the PFO and proceeding with closure. However in the properly selected patient population there is growing clinical experience and experimental evidence suggesting that closure of PFO is a safe and effective treatment modality.

TI Is proximal femoral nail antirotation superior to gamma nail and dynamic
   hip screw in treatment of intertrochanteric fractures? a pairwise and
   network meta-analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
AB Purposes: Proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) was theoretically designed to be an ideal intramedullary device for the fixation of intertrochanteric fractures by providing angular and rotational stability. We investigated when compared with Gamma nail (GN) and dynamic hip screw (DHS) whether PFNA was associated with (1) a lower incidence of reoperation, mortality and fixation failures, (2) a lower risk of major complications (wound infection and thromboembolism), (3) less operative blood loss, shorter surgical time, operative fluoroscopy time and hospital stay. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search in MEDLINE (R), EMBASE, OVID and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and identified 753 papers. Of these, identified 13 randomized controlled trials comparing two (or more) common internal fixation devices (among PFNA, GN and DHS) in treatment of Intertrochanteric fractures. We performed both traditional direct-comparison meta-analysis and network meta-analysis. The strength of evidence was evaluated by using GRADE profiler software. Results: Direct-comparison meta-analysis demonstrated PFNA was associated with less operative blood loss when compared with GN (95% CI, -93.56 to -5.44, low confidence evidence) and DHS (95% CI, -291.90 to -151.58, low confidence evidence), and less operative fluoroscopy time when compared with GN (95% CI, -56.21 to -3.79, low confidence evidence). Network meta-analysis only found that PFNA was associated with less operative blood loss when compared with DHS (95% CI, -342.12 to -81.94) with very low confidence evidence. Conclusions: Current published evidence does not support the superiority of PFNA to other fixation strategies for intertrochanteric fractures. Although use of PFNA may be advantageous in reducing the operative blood loss and fluoroscopy time when compared with GN and DHS, the conclusion was limited and unacceptable because of the relatively low quality of evidences with either low or very low strength of confidence.

TI Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and measures of human
   fertility: a systematic review
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY
AB Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are found widespread in the environment and humans. The relation of PFASs to fertility has now been examined in a relatively large number of epidemiologic studies and a synthesis is in order. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFASs and measures of human fertility, with particular emphasis on perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Systematic literature searches were initially conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE and subsequently in references and citations of included papers. Studies were included if they assessed exposure to PFASs in biological samples in relation to reproductive hormones, semen characteristics, or time to pregnancy (TTP). Study characteristics and results were abstracted to predefined forms, and the studies were assessed for the risk of bias and confounding. Sixteen studies investigated the association between PFAS exposure in men and semen parameters, reproductive hormone levels, or TTP. There was a lack of consistent results among the numerous investigated exposure-outcome combinations. However, subtle associations between higher PFOS and lower testosterone or abnormal semen morphology cannot be excluded. Eleven studies assessed the association between PFAS exposure in women and TTP or reproductive hormones levels. Four of eight studies found prolonged TTP with higher PFOS or PFOA, but only one study found an association when restricting to nulliparous women. In men, there is little evidence of an association between PFAS exposure and semen quality or levels of reproductive hormones. For PFOS and PFOA, the literature indicates an association with female fecundability in parous women, which is most likely not causal.

TI Implementing oxygen control in chip-based cell and tissue culture
   systems
SO LAB ON A CHIP
AB Oxygen is essential in the energy metabolism of cells, as well as being an important regulatory parameter influencing cell differentiation and function. Interest in precise oxygen control for in vitro cultures of tissues and cells continues to grow, especially with the emergence of the organ-on-a-chip and the desire to emulate in vivo conditions. This was recently discussed in this journal in a Critical Review by Brennan et al. (Lab Chip (2014). DOI: 10.1039/C4LC00853G). Microfluidics can be used to introduce flow to facilitate nutrient supply to and waste removal from in vitro culture systems. Well-defined oxygen gradients can also be established. However, cells can quickly alter the oxygen balance in their vicinity. In this Tutorial Review, we expand on the Brennan paper to focus on the implementation of oxygen analysis in these systems to achieve continuous monitoring. Both electrochemical and optical approaches for the integration of oxygen monitoring in microfluidic tissue and cell culture systems will be discussed. Differences in oxygen requirements from one organ to the next are a challenging problem, as oxygen delivery is limited by its uptake into medium. Hence, we discuss the factors determining oxygen concentrations in solutions and consider the possible use of artificial oxygen carriers to increase dissolved oxygen concentrations. The selection of device material for applications requiring precise oxygen control is discussed in detail, focusing on oxygen permeability. Lastly, a variety of devices is presented, showing the diversity of approaches that can be employed to control and monitor oxygen concentrations in in vitro experiments.

TI Hepatic miRNA profiles and thyroid hormone homeostasis in rats exposed
   to dietary potassium perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS)
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) has been widely used in a variety of industrial and commercial applications as a surfactant and stain repellent. PFOS causes liver damage (including liver tumors) in experimental animals, primarily via interaction with PPAR alpha and CAR/PXR. We investigated the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in PFOS-induced hepatotoxicity, and mechanisms involved in abnormal thyroid hormone (TH) homeostasis, in the livers of adult male rats exposed in feed to 50 mg PFOS/kg diet for 28 days. PFOS-treated rats exhibited expected histopathological and clinical chemistry changes, and global gene expression changes consistent with the involvement of PPARa and CAR/PXR. Thirty-eight miRNAs were significantly altered. Three members of the miR-200 family were the most increased, while miR-122-5p and miR-21-5p were the most decreased, in PFOS-treated rats. Expression of the miR-23b-3p/27b-3p/24-3p cluster also decreased in PFOS-treated animals. Pathway analysis of miRNAs and associated gene expression changes suggests involvement of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a primary process of tumor cell motility and cancer metastasis. Our analysis also revealed transcripts that may mediate PFOS-induced effects on TH homeostasis including: activation of the CAR/PXR pathway, phase enzymes, and deiodinase. These changes are consistent with low serum TH due to enhanced metabolic clearance of TH. However, most TH hepatic target genes were not altered in a manner consistent with reduced TH signaling, suggesting that PFOS exposure did not induce functional hypothyroidism. Collectively, the study suggests an important role for miRNAs in PFOS-induced hepatotoxicity and provides insight into the effects of PFOS on TH homeostasis. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI A Systematic Review of the Effect of Piston Diameter in Stapes Surgery
   for Otosclerosis on Hearing Results
SO LARYNGOSCOPE
AB Objective: To evaluate the effect of piston diameter in primary stapedotomy for otosclerosis patients measured by hearing outcome.
   Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library.
   Review Methods: A systematic search was conducted. Studies reporting original data on the effect of piston diameter on pure-tone audiometric results in patients undergoing primary stapedotomy for otosclerosis were included. Relevance and risk of bias of the selected articles were assessed. Studies with low relevance, high risk of bias, or both were excluded. Absolute risks and risk differences, means and mean differences, and 95% confidence intervals were extracted.
   Results: Twelve studies with moderate to high relevance and moderate risk of bias were included for data extraction. Air-bone gap closure to 10 dB or less was assessed in six studies, the majority of which did not show a statistically significant or clinically relevant difference between two pistons with a different diameter. More importantly, the differences that were found were not consistently in favor of smaller-diameter pistons or larger-diameter pistons. Mean postoperative airbone gap ranged from 3 dB in favor of a smaller-diameter piston to 3 dB in favor of a larger-diameter piston across four studies. Permanent sensorineural hearing loss was assessed in eight studies and occurred in only one study. In this study, no difference was found between a 0.4-mm-diameter piston and a 0.6-mm-diameter piston.
   Conclusion: There is not sufficient evidence to support the superiority of the use of a larger-diameter piston compared to a smaller-diameter piston for primary stapedotomy in otosclerosis patients.

TI The Effect of Biomaterials Used for Tissue Regeneration Purposes on
   Polarization of Macrophages
SO BIORESEARCH OPEN ACCESS
AB Activation of macrophages is critical in the acute phase of wound healing after implantation of surgical biomaterials. To understand the response of macrophages, they are often cultured in vitro on biomaterials. Since a wide range of biomaterials is currently used in the clinics, we undertook a systematic review of the macrophage polarization in response to these different surgical biomaterials in vitro. Beside the chemistry, material characteristics such as dimension, pore size, and surface topography are of great influence on the response of macrophages. The macrophage response also appears to depend on the differences in sterilization techniques that induce lasting biochemical changes or residues of chemicals and their byproducts used for sterilization. Regarding tissue-based biomaterials, macrophages on human or porcine dermis, strongly cross-linked by chemicals elicit in general a proinflammatory response with higher amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. Synthetic biomaterials such as polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET)+polyacrylamide (PAAm), PET+sodium salt of poly(acrylic acid) (PAANa), perfluoropolyether (PFPE) with large posts, PEG-g-PA, and polydioxanone (PDO) always appear to elicit an anti-inflammatory response in macrophages, irrespective of origin of the macrophages, for example, buffy coats or full blood. In conclusion, in general in vitro models contribute to evaluate the foreign body reaction on surgical biomaterials. Although it is difficult to simulate complexity of host response elicited by biomaterials, after their surgical implantation, an in vitro model gives indications of the initial foreign body response and allows the comparison of this response between biomaterials.

TI X-ray spectroscopic and scattering methods applied to the
   characterisation of cobalt-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalysts
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB This review aims to critically assess the use of X-ray techniques, both of a scattering (e.g. X-ray diffraction (XRD), pair distribution function (PDF)) and spectroscopic nature (X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS)), in the study of cobalt-based Fisher-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) catalysts. In particular, the review will focus on how these techniques have been successfully used to describe the salient characteristics of these catalysts that govern subsequent activity and selectivity, as well as to afford insight into deactivation phenomena that have seemingly stifled their application. We discuss how these X-ray-based techniques have been used to yield insight into the bulk structure, the catalyst surface, oxidation states, local (cobalt) geometry, and elemental composition of particles, primarily from a 1D perspective but we also highlight how, with recent developments in advanced X-ray characterisation methods, crucial information can now be obtained in 2D and 3D. The examples chosen focus on data acquired in situ/operando, under realistic operating conditions and during activation which often allow for obtaining a more relevant perspective on the changes in catalyst structure that accompany a change in catalyst performance. We conclude with a perspective on some of the challenges that beset the Co-based FTS technology and discuss how X-ray based techniques could be used to solve them.

TI Drugs of abuse, cytostatic drugs and iodinated contrast media in tap
   water from the Madrid region (central Spain):A case study to analyse
   their occurrence and human health risk characterization
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB This work analyses the presence of forty-eight emerging pollutants, including twenty-five drugs of abuse and metabolites, seventeen cytostatic drugs and six iodinated contrast media, in tap water from the Madrid Region. Analysis of the target compounds in the tap water was performed by means of (on-line or off-line) solid-phase extraction followed by analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A preliminary human health risk characterization was undertaken for each individual compound and for different groups of compounds with a common mechanism of action found in tap water.
   The results of the study showed the presence of eight out of the twenty-five drugs of abuse and metabolites analysed, namely, the cocainics cocaine and benzoylecgonine, the amphetamine-type stimulants ephedrine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and methamphetamine, the opioid methadone and its metabolite 2-ethylene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine and, finally caffeine at concentrations ranging from 0.11 to 502 ng L-1. Four out of the six analysed iodinated contrast media, namely, diatrizoate, iohexol, iomeprol and iopromide, were detected in at least one sample, with concentration values varying between 0.4 and 5 ng L-1. Cytostatic compounds were not detected in any sample. Caffeine was the substance showing the highest concentrations, up to 502 ng L-1, mainly in the drinking water sampling point located in Madrid city. Among the other drugs of abuse, the most abundant compounds were cocaine and benzoylecgonine, detected at concentrations ranging from 0.11 to 86 ng L-1 and from 0.11 to 53 ng L-1, respectively. Regarding iodinated contrast media, iohexol was the most ubiquitous and abundant compound, with a frequency of detection of 100% and concentrations from 0.5 to 5.0 ng L-1 in basically the same range in all sampling points.
   Taking into account the results and types of treatment applied, ozonisation plus granular activated carbon filtration appears to be efficient in the removal of cocaine and benzoylecgonine. For the amphetamine-type stimulants, opioids and caffeine, ozonisation plus granular activated carbon filtration and ultrafiltration plus reverse osmosis showed higher removal efficiency than sand filtration.
   The human health risk characterization performed indicates that the lifetime consumption of the tap waters analysed has associated a negligible human health concern. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Enhancing tetrabromobisphenol A biodegradation in river sediment
   microcosms and understanding the corresponding microbial community
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB In situ remediation of contaminated sediment using microbes is a promising environmental treatment method. This study used bioaugmentation to investigate the biodegradation of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in sediment microcosms collected from an electronic-waste recycling site. Treatments included adding possible biodegradation intermediates of TBBPA, including 2,4-dibromophenol (2,4-DBP), 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP), and bisphenol A (BPA) as co-substrates. Bioaugmentation was done with Ochrobactrum sp. T (TBBPA-degrader) and a mixed culture of Ochrobactrum sp. T, Bacillus sp. GZT (TBP-degrader) and Bacillus sp. GZB (BPA-degrader). Results showed that bioaugmentation with Ochrobactrum sp. T significantly improved TBBPA degradation efficiencies in sediment microcosms (P < 0.01); aerobic conditions increased the microbes' degradation activities. Co-substrates 2,4-DBP, TBP and BPA inhibited biodegradation of TBBPA. A metagenomic analysis of total 16S rRNA genes from the treated sediment microcosms showed that the following dominant genera: Ochrobactrum, Parasegetibacter, Thermithiobacillus, Phenylobacterium and Sphingomonas. The genus level of Ochrobactrum increased with increased degradation time, within 10-week of incubation. Microbes from genus Ochrobactrum are mainly linked to enhance the TBBPA biodegradation.

TI OCCURRENCE OF CONTAMINANTS OF EMERGING CONCERN (CEC) IN CONVENTIONAL AND
   NON CONVENTIONAL WATER RESOURCES IN TUNISIA
SO FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) include a wide variety of compounds like pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and their metabolites. In developing countries, CEC are gaining interest as they are contaminating the water resources. In Tunisia, for the first time, a total of 25 PPCPs and three of their metabolites were analysed in wastewater, reclaimed water, surface water and groundwater. Most of selected CEC were detected not only in raw wastewater, but also in treated wastewater and reclaimed water. High contents of Cl and Na in wastewater and reclaimed water were an indication of industrial discharge. PPCPs were detected in surface water from the Meliane River; the highest concentrations were measured close to the estuary to the Mediterranean Sea. High concentrations of 2-OH-ibuprofene in the Meliane River downstream a wastewater treatment plant might result from the biodegradation of ibuprofen during secondary wastewater treatment. Based on their levels of concentration, it is proposed to use carbamazepine, caffeine, ibuprofene, atenolol, fenofibric acid, methylparabene, bisphenol A, and 2-OH-ibuprofene as indicators of wastewater-derived pollution of surface water resources in Tunisia. Salinity of the groundwater in the study area is controlled by sea water entered decades ago due to over-pumping of groundwater. Groundwater quality is also influenced by CEC as sulfamethoxazol, carbamazepine, methylparabene, propylparabene, bisphenol A, trichlosan, and 1-H-benzotriazole were detected in groundwater collected from an area exposed to irrigation with reclaimed water. The presence of these compounds indicates that they are not completely removed during soil passage according to incomplete sorption and/or biodegradation. Thus, these compounds are suggested as indicators of wastewater contamination confirming the pollution of groundwater resources at sites where wastewater is reused for irrigation in agriculture. Special attention has to be paid to the occurrence of TRS occurring in groundwater since this compound is recognized to produce antibiotic resistance in the environment.

TI Signaling in a Polluted World: Oxidative Stress as an Overlooked
   Mechanism Linking Contaminants to Animal Communication
SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB The capacity to communicate effectively with other individuals plays a critical role in the daily life of an individual and can have important fitness consequences. Animals rely on a number of visual and non-visual signals, whose production brings costs to the individual. The theory of honest signaling states that these costs are higher for low than for high-quality individuals, which prevents cheating and makes signals, such as skin and plumage coloration, indicators of individual's quality or condition. The condition-dependent nature of signals makes them ideally suited as indicators of environmental quality, implying that signal production might be affected by contaminants. In this mini-review article, we have made the point that oxidative stress (OS) is one overlooked mechanism linking exposure to contaminants to signaling because (i) many contaminants can influence the individual's oxidative balance, and (ii) generation of both visual and non-visual signals is sensitive to OS. To this end, we have provided the first comprehensive review on the way both non-organic (heavy metals, especially mercury) and organic [persistent organic pollutants (POPs)] contaminants may influence either OS or sexual signaling. We have also paid special attention to emerging classes of pollutants like brominated flame-retardants (BFRs) and perfluoroalkoxy alkanes (PFAs) in order to stimulate research in this area. We have finally provided suggestions and warnings for future work on the links among OS, sexual signaling, and contaminant exposure.

TI Recent research progress of polymer donor/polymer acceptor blend solar
   cells
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Polymer/polymer blend solar cells based on a blend of two types of conjugated polymers acting as an electron donor (hole transport) and acceptor (electron transport) have recently attracted considerable attention, because they have numerous potential advantages over conventional polymer/fullerene blend solar cells. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) was slightly above 2% five years ago, whereas PCEs of beyond 8% are the state-of-the-art today, and the efficiency gap between polymer/polymer and polymer/fullerene systems has closed very rapidly. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress towards the performance enhancement of polymer/polymer blend solar cells. In addition, we discuss the future outlook and challenges regarding PCEs beyond 10%.

TI The relationship between mercury and autism: A comprehensive review and
   discussion
SO JOURNAL OF TRACE ELEMENTS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB The brain pathology in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) indicates marked and ongoing inflammatory reactivity with concomitant neuronal damage. These findings are suggestive of neuronal insult as a result of external factors, rather than some type of developmental mishap. Various xenobiotics have been suggested as possible causes of this pathology. In a recent review, the top ten environmental compounds suspected of causing autism and learning disabilities were listed and they included: lead, methyl-mercury, polychorinated biphenyls, organophosphate pesticides, organochlorine pesticides, endocrine disruptors, automotive exhaust, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and perfluorinated compounds. This current review, however, will focus specifically on mercury exposure and ASD by conducting a comprehensive literature search of original studies in humans that examine the potential relationship between mercury and ASD, categorizing, summarizing, and discussing the published research that addresses this topic. This review found 91 studies that examine the potential relationship between mercury and ASD from 1999 to February 2016. Of these studies, the vast majority (74%) suggest that mercury is a risk factor for ASD, revealing both direct and indirect effects. The preponderance of the evidence indicates that mercury exposure is causal and/or contributory in ASD. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH.

TI High-Density SNP Map Construction and QTL Identification for the
   Apetalous Character in Brassica napus L.
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB The apetalous genotype is a morphological ideotype for increasing seed yield and should be of considerable agricultural use; however, only a few studies have focused on the genetic control of this trait in Brass/ca napus. In the present study, a recombinant inbred line, the AH population, containing 189 individuals was derived from a cross between an apetalous line 'APL01' and a normally petalled variety 'Holly'. The Brass/ca 60 K Infinium BeadChip Array harboring 52,157 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers was used to genotype the AH individuals. A high-density genetic linkage map was constructed based on 2,755 bins involving 11,458 SNPs and 57 simple sequence repeats, and was used to identify loci associated with petalous degree (PDgr). The linkage map covered 2,027.53 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.72 cM. The AH map had good collinearity with the B. napus reference genome, indicating its high quality and accuracy. After phenotypic analyses across five different experiments, a total of 19 identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) distributed across chromosomes A3, A5, A6, A9 and C8 were obtained, and these QTLs were further integrated into nine consensus QTLs by a meta-analysis. Interestingly, the major QTL qPD.C8-2 was consistently detected in all five experiments, and qPD.A9-2 and qPD.C8-3 were stably expressed in four experiments. Comparative mapping between the AH map and the B. napus reference genome suggested that there were 328 genes underlying the confidence intervals of the three steady QTLs. Based on the Gene Ontology assignments of 52 genes to the regulation of floral development in published studies, 146 genes were considered as potential candidate genes for PDgr. The current study carried out a QTL analysis for PDgr using a high-density SNP map in B. napus, providing novel targets for improving seed yield. These results advanced our understanding of the genetic control of PDgr regulation in B. napus.

TI X-Vane: A sampling assembly combining a Niskin-X bottle and titanium
   frame vane for trace metal analysis of sea water
SO MARINE CHEMISTRY
AB A new sampling assembly consisting of a commercially available 5-L Niskin-X sampling bottle attached to a titanium frame vane was designed for uncontaminated sampling of trace metals in sea water at volumes of 5 L per depth. The assembly, called an X-Vane sampler, consists of a titanium and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polymer supporting frame, a "Pi-style" secure bottle assembly and secure messenger assembly with titanium springs, a polycarbonate weather vane rear fin assembly, a commercially available modified 5-L Niskin-X bottle, a small temperature and depth (TD) logger, and a nylon and stainless steel wire clamp. The X-Vane sampler permits positioning the Niskin-X bottle at upstream of the hydrowire, away from any contamination. The Teflon-coated messenger strikes the "Pi-style" assembly, which closes the Niskin-X, thereby obtaining a sea water sample for trace metal analysis at the desired depth. A second messenger held by the "Pi-style" assembly is released downward along the hydrowire. In this manner, several bottles can be triggered sequentially in one operation. The Niskin-X bottles are stored and processed in a PVC clean sample drawing enclosure with a clean environment created by three class-100 air filter vents. The X-vane sampling system is easy to operate and is low in cost, compared to other clean sampling methods. In addition, it can be adapted to different types of research vessels with different hydrowire conditions. Analyses of contamination-prone trace metals (Fe, Al, and Mn) showed that samples obtained using the X-Vane sampler were uncontaminated, and the analysis results were in good agreement with those for samples obtained using a MITESS-Vane sampler. The X-Vane sampling device was demonstrated to be a reliable device for obtaining sea water samples for trace metal analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Coupling of membrane filtration and advanced oxidation processes for
   removal of pharmaceutical residues: A critical review
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Pharmaceuticals as emerging pollutants have become a major concern not only because of the threat posed to health and safety of the aquatic life but also due to their continuous accumulation in aquatic environment and development of antibiotic-resistant microbial strains. Single classical water treatment techniques have been generally inadequate for the removal of these hazardous substances. Combined treatment techniques such as membrane separation and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is an exciting technology for complete removal of these pollutants because each technique complements the advantages and overcomes the challenges of the other. Technical flexibility of membrane separation technology has allowed possible integration/coupling with several AOPs as: pretreatment stage for removal of organics (which may cause membrane fouling) from membrane feed stream; post-treatment stage for oxidation of organics in both membrane permeate and concentrate streams or one pot/hybrid process for concurrent separation and oxidation of pollutants in the feed stream. AOPs such as ozonation, peroxone (O-3/H2O2), UV/H2O2, photo-Fenton, photocatalysis and electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have been successfully integrated with membrane separation for removal of pharmaceuticals from water and they are critically examined in this review.

TI Metabolic Profiling of Chicken Embryos Exposed to Perfluorooctanoic Acid
   ( PFOA) and Agonists to Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors
SO PLOS ONE
AB Untargeted metabolic profiling of body fluids in experimental animals and humans exposed to chemicals may reveal early signs of toxicity and indicate toxicity pathways. Avian embryos develop separately from their mothers, which gives unique possibilities to study effects of chemicals during embryo development with minimal confounding factors from the mother. In this study we explored blood plasma and allantoic fluid from chicken embryos as matrices for revealing metabolic changes caused by exposure to chemicals during embryonic development. Embryos were exposed via egg injection on day 7 to the environmental pollutant perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and effects on the metabolic profile on day 12 were compared with those caused by GW7647 and rosiglitazone, which are selective agonists to peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor a (PPAR alpha) and PPAR gamma, respectively. Analysis of the metabolite concentrations from allantoic fluid by Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) showed clear separation between the embryos exposed to GW7647, rosiglitazone, and vehicle control, respectively. In blood plasma only GW7647 caused a significant effect on the metabolic profile. PFOA induced embryo mortality and increased relative liver weight at the highest dose. Sublethal doses of PFOA did not significantly affect the metabolic profile in either matrix, although single metabolites appeared to be altered. Neonatal mortality by PFOA in the mouse has been suggested to be mediated via activation of PPAR alpha. However, we found no similarity in the metabolite profile of chicken embryos exposed to PFOA with those of embryos exposed to PPAR agonists. This indicates that PFOA does not activate PPAR pathways in our model at concentrations in eggs and embryos well above those found in wild birds. The present study suggests that allantoic fluid and plasma from chicken embryos are useful and complementary matrices for exploring effects on the metabolic profile resulting from chemical exposure during embryonic development.

TI Associations of Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) with Lower Birth
   Weight: An Evaluation of Potential Confounding by Glomerular Filtration
   Rate Using a Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Model (PBPK)
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been associated with lower birth weight in epidemiologic studies. This association could be attributable to glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is related to PFAS concentration and birth weight.
   OBJECTIVES: We used a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of pregnancy to assess how much of the PFAS-birth weight association observed in epidemiologic studies might be attributable to GFR.
   METHODS: We modified a PBPK model to reflect the association of GFR with birth weight (estimated from three studies of GFR and birth weight) and used it to simulate PFAS concentrations in maternal and cord plasma. The model was run 250,000 times, with variation in parameters, to simulate a population. Simulated data were analyzed to evaluate the association between PFAS levels and birth weight due to GFR. We compared simulated estimates with those from a meta-analysis of epidemiologic data.
   RESULTS: The reduction in birth weight for each 1-ng/mL increase in simulated cord plasma for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was 2.72g (95% CI: -3.40, -2.04), and for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was 7.13 g (95% CI: -8.46, -5.80); results based on maternal plasma at term were similar. Results were sensitive to variations in PFAS level distributions and the strength of the GFR-birth weight association. In comparison, our meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies suggested that each 1-ng/mL increase in prenatal PFOS and PFOA levels was associated with 5.00 g (95% CI: -21.66, -7.78) and 14.72 g (95% CI: -8.92, -1.09) reductions in birth weight, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: Results of our simulations suggest that a substantial proportion of the association between prenatal PFAS and birth weight may be attributable to confounding by GFR and that confounding by GFR may be more important in studies with sample collection later in pregnancy.

TI On-line sample extraction and purification for the LC-MS determination
   of emerging contaminants in environmental samples
SO TRENDS IN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB In the present paper the application of on-line preparation techniques applied to LC-MS for the determination of emerging contaminants in environmental samples are critically reviewed highlighting the advantages but also the limits and the way to overcome them. Recent methods are collected in a detailed table and discussed in the text according to the different classes of compounds. The implementation of on-line SPE made possible the effective development of faster methods by reducing the analysis time and thus increasing the analytical productivity. The on-line SPE method are particularly suitable in studies where only limited sample material is available, as the sample volume can be as low as 1 mL. Most of the multiresidual methods have been developed using wettable and polar embedded reverse phases, sometimes sequentially packed with weak ionic exchangers in order to widen the polarity range of the adsorbents. On-line techniques have been also applied in cleanup of extracts of solid environmental samples, such as sediment, soil and biota, in order to minimize the ionization suppression effects from the matrix. Many applications employed RAM, often coupled to monolithic pre-concentration columns, but there is an increasing number of application of TFC for the determination of emerging pollutants in environmental samples.

TI Three plasma metabolite signatures for diagnosing high altitude
   pulmonary edema
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a potentially fatal condition, occurring at altitudes greater than 3,000 m and affecting rapidly ascending, non-acclimatized healthy individuals. However, the lack of biomarkers for this disease still constitutes a bottleneck in the clinical diagnosis. Here, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-TOF mass spectrometry was applied to study plasma metabolite profiling from 57 HAPE and 57 control subjects. 14 differential plasma metabolites responsible for the discrimination between the two groups from discovery set (35 HAPE subjects and 35 healthy controls) were identified. Furthermore, 3 of the 14 metabolites (C8-ceramide, sphingosine and glutamine) were selected as candidate diagnostic biomarkers for HAPE using metabolic pathway impact analysis. The feasibility of using the combination of these three biomarkers for HAPE was evaluated, where the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.981 and 0.942 in the discovery set and the validation set (22 HAPE subjects and 22 healthy controls), respectively. Taken together, these results suggested that this composite plasma metabolite signature may be used in HAPE diagnosis, especially after further investigation and verification with larger samples.

TI Treatment technologies for aqueous perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and
   perfluorooctanoate (PFOA): A critical review with an emphasis on field
   testing
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
AB Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are used in fire-fighting foams but this is now being questioned because concerns are growing about their toxicity and impacts on the environment. Past use has resulted in their widespread accumulation in water sources, sediments and biota. They may pose risks to human health and the environment. Several technologies have been tested for removing PFOS and PFOA from water but most have only been developed at laboratory scale. This paper provides a critical review of existing methods for removing PFOS and PFOA from wastewaters with an emphasis on identifying processes that show promise for the development of practical industrial-scale remediation technologies. It is concluded that among the remediation technologies cited in the literature, removal by activated carbon has been the most widely used, with several successful field tests being reported. However, a number of limitations to the use of activated carbon exist, such as being ineffective at removing PFOA and other PFCs. Other adsorbents that have the potential to treat aqueous PFOS and PFOA include organo-clays, clay minerals and carbon nanotubes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Microwave-assisted extraction of emerging pollutants in environmental
   and biological samples before chromatographic determination
SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Two of the main topics of growing concern in analytical chemistry are the development of green analytical methods and the determination of emerging pollutants. One of the well-established green extraction techniques is microwave-assisted extraction (MAE). After giving a brief description of MAE principles, the present review comprehensively describes the applications of MAE in the past six years for the determination of the main families of emerging organic pollutants in the environment. Compared to other extraction techniques, MAE offers many advantages, such as great reductions in extraction time and solvent consumption, as well as the possibility of performing multiple extractions, thereby increasing sample throughput. From a technological point of view, most future application areas are likely to focus on improving the flexibility of recently introduced sequential systems with the capacity to control conditions in each extraction vessel.

However, there are circumstances when desalting, preconcentration, or the fractionation of samples into polar and nonpolar metabolites is of value for enabling the subsequent analysis. Because of its simplicity and ease of automation SPE is well suited to such applications prior to analysis by ultra-performance LC-TOF-MS. In the present study, the properties of a range of SPE phases have been investigated with respect to the range of metabolites that can be extracted from urine. The phases include alkyl modified (C8 and, C18-OH and C18) silica and polymeric materials. The results show that the C18 phase was well suited to fractionating urine into samples suitable for separate analysis of polar and nonpolar constituents via HILIC and RPLC, respectively, while the polymeric materials were best for concentrating and desalting samples.

TI Fluorine in medical microbubbles - Methodologies implemented for
   engineering and investigating fluorocarbon-based microbubbles
SO JOURNAL OF FLUORINE CHEMISTRY
AB Gaseous microbubbles are being used in cardiovascular diagnostic procedures. They have further potential in diagnosis of tumours, vascular and blood flow abnormalities, as well as for targeted, ultrasound-triggered drug delivery and as intravascular mechanical devices. All the commercially available microbubble-based contrast agents comprise a fluorinated inner gas in their composition. Fluorinated components (fluorocarbon gases, self-assembling perfluoroalkylated surfactants) can play a key role in the engineering, investigation and development of microbubbles. Fluorocarbon gases provide osmotic stabilization and a co-surfactant contribution to interfacial tension reduction. Perfluoroallcylated surfactants self-assemble in aqueous media to form bubble shells with exceptional elasticity and resilience, and, optionally, effective anchorage for surface functionalization. This paper critically reviews the foremost methods used for preparing and monitoring microbubble suspensions. In particular, it identifies some common pitfalls encountered in the determination of microbubble sizes. The paper also reviews the methods used for collecting reliable data on the bubble morphology and shell structure that are required for understanding, controlling and improving their functional properties. Models for bubble shell studies include spontaneously adsorbed Gibbs films and spread Langmuir monolayers. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Occupational risk factors in inflammatory bowel disease
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although the aetiology of IBD is not completely understood, an interaction between genetic and environmental factors has been proposed. In this context, however, environmental epidemiology lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the possible role of occupational exposures in IBD development and progression. Therefore, aim of our review was to evaluate how certain occupational risk factors may affect IBD pathogenesis, clinical history and severity of disease manifestations.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A critical revision of available literature concerning exposure to groups of potential workplace hazardous agents and IBD, as it appears in Medline and Web of knowledge, was performed.
   RESULTS: The role of workplace exposures to chemical and biological agents, ionizing or nonionizing radiations, shift-works, indoor, and sedentary works as well as job strain on IBD has been critically revised. However, the limited number of studies addressing these issues prevented us from extrapolating definite conclusions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our review pointed out some critical aspects concerning the relationship between occupational factors and IBD, in terms of causative pathways, hazardous exposure, susceptibility and consequences of IBD functional limitations on career choice and fitness for work that need future investigations. Overall, this seems a challenging public health issue, considering the strong IBD impact on patients' quality of life, work productivity and costs to society. Moreover, this review may encourage concerted actions of health care specialists, occupational physicians, employers and IBD workers to plan preventive and protective measures for "healthier patterns of work" for IBD and to develop innovative perspectives for an integrated management of "IBD at work".

TI One drop chemical derivatization - DESI-MS analysis for metabolite
   structure identification
SO JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY
AB Structural elucidation of metabolites is an important part during the discovery and development process of new pharmaceutical drugs. Liquid Chromatography (LC) in combination with Mass Spectrometry (MS) is usually the technique of choice for structural identification but cannot always provide precise structural identification of the studied metabolite (e.g. site of hydroxylation and site of glucuronidation). In order to identify those metabolites, different approaches are used combined with MS data including nuclear magnetic resonance, hydrogen/deuterium exchange and chemical derivatization followed by LC-MS. Those techniques are often time-consuming and/or require extra sample pre-treatment.
   In this paper, a fast and easy to set up tool using desorption electrospray ionization-MS for metabolite identification is presented. In the developed method, analytes in solution are simply dried on a glass plate with printed Teflon spots and then a single drop of derivatization mixture is added. Once the spot is dried, the derivatized compound is analyzed. Six classic chemical derivatizations were adjusted to work as a one drop reaction and applied on a list of compounds with relevant functional groups. Subsequently, two successive reactions on a single spot of amoxicillin were tested and the methodology described was successfully applied on an in vitro incubated alprazolam metabolite. All reactions and analyses were performed within an hour and gave useful structural information by derivatizing functional groups, making the method a time-saving and efficient tool for metabolite identification if used in addition or in some cases as an alternative to common methods.

TI Prenatal exposure to environmental chemical contaminants and asthma and
   eczema in school-age children
SO ALLERGY
AB BackgroundEmerging evidence suggests that prenatal or early-life exposures to environmental contaminants may contribute to an increased risk of asthma and allergies in children. We aimed to the explore associations of prenatal exposures to a large set of environmental chemical contaminants with asthma and eczema in school-age children.
   MethodsWe studied 1024 mother-child pairs from Greenland and Ukraine from the INUENDO birth cohort. Data were collected by means of an interview-based questionnaire when the children were 5-9years of age. Questions from the ISAAC study were used to define asthma, eczema, and wheeze. We applied principal components analysis (PCA) to sixteen contaminants in maternal serum sampled during pregnancy, including perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), metabolites of diethylhexyl (DEHP) and diisononyl (DiNP) phthalates, PCB-153, and p,p-DDE. Scores of five principal components (PCs) explaining 70% of the variance were included in multiple logistic regression models.
   ResultsIn a meta-analysis that included both populations, the PC2 score, reflecting exposure to DiNP, was negatively associated with current eczema (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96). Other associations were not consistent between the two populations. In Ukrainian children, the PC3 score (DEHP) was positively associated with current wheeze (adjusted OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.03-2.37), whereas the PC5 score, dominated by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), was inversely associated with current wheeze (OR 0.64, 0.41-0.99). In Greenlandic children, a negative association of PC4 (organochlorines) with ever eczema (OR 0.78, 0.61-0.99) was found.
   ConclusionsWe found limited evidence to support a link between prenatal exposure to environmental chemical contaminants and childhood asthma and eczema.

TI The scientific basis for the use of biomaterials in stress urinary
   incontinence (SUI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP)
SO BJU INTERNATIONAL
AB ObjectivesTo review the scientific and clinical literature to assess the basis for the use of biomaterials in stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Pelvic floor diseases (PFDS), such as SUI and POP, are common and vexing disorders. While synthetic mesh-based repairs have long been considered an option for PFD treatment, and their efficacy established in randomised clinical trials, safety of its use has recently been called into question.
   Materials and MethodsUsing the PubMed, MEDLINE and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) databases, we performed a critical review of English-language publications that contained the following keywords: pelvic organ prolapse', stress urinary incontinence', mesh', biomaterial', collagen', elastin' and extracellular matrix'. After reviewing for relevance for mesh use in the pelvis by two independent reviewers with a third available in the case of disagreement, a total of 60 articles were included in the present review.
   ResultsWe found that many of the potential causes of PFDs are due to altered metabolism of patient extracellular matrix (specifically collagen, elastin, and their respective enzymes) and as such, repairs using native tissue may suffer from the same abnormalities leading to a subsequent lack of repair integrity. However, mesh use is not without its unique risks. Several publications have suggested that biomaterials may undergo alteration after implantation, but these findings have not been demonstrated in the normal milieu.
   ConclusionWhile the decision for the use of synthetic mesh is scientifically sound, its benefits and risks must be discussed with the patient in an informed decision-making process.

TI A broad cocktail of environmental pollutants found in eggs of three
   seabird species from remote colonies in Norway
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB Eggs of 3 seabird species, common eider (Somateria mollisima), European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis aristotelis), and European herring gull (Larus argentatus), were surveyed for a broad range of legacy and emerging pollutants to assess chemical mixture exposure profiles of seabirds from the Norwegian marine environment. In total, 201 chemical substances were targeted for analysis ranging from metals, organotin compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and associated metabolites, chlorinated paraffins, chlorinated and nonchlorinated organic pesticides, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), dechlorane plus, octachlorostyrene, brominated flame retardants (BFRs), organophosphorous compounds, brominated and alkyl phenols, cyclic siloxanes, and phthalates. Of the chemicals targeted, 149 substances were found above the detection limits, with metals dominating the contaminant profile and comprising 60% of the total contaminant load. Polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides, organophosphorous compounds, and PFAS were the dominant contaminant classes of organic pollutants found within the seabird species, with the highest loads occurring in herring gulls, followed by shag, and common eider. New generation pollutants (e.g., PFAS, organophosphorous compounds, and alkylphenols) were detected at similar or higher concentrations than the legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Time trends of reported concentrations of legacy POPs appear to have decreased in recent decades from the Norwegian coastal environment. Concentrations of detected pollutants do not appear to have a negative effect on seabird population development within the sampling area. Additional stress caused by pollutants, however, may affect seabird health more at the individual level. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:1296-1308. (c) 2015 SETAC

TI A systematic review on the effects of environmental exposure to some
   organohalogens and phthalates on early puberty
SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB Background: Early puberty is a common worldwide problem. Different parameters as genetics, metabolic diseases, obesity, as well as environmental factors may affect the age of puberty. This systematic review aims to survey the related literature on the effects of environmental pollutants and especially organohalogens and phthalates on early puberty. Materials and Methods: A systematic review of papers published in the English language was completed in January 2014. Studies on the associations of organohalogens and phthalates with the puberty time were included. A literature search was conducted in EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from 1995 to January 2014; moreover manual search through references of relevant manuscripts was considered. The literature search identified 212 papers, of which 13 papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the current study. Two reviewers independently identified relevant papers for potential inclusion and assessed the methodological quality. Results: This review included 6572 participants in nine countries from three continents (Europe, North America, and Asia). Different studies determined the effects of pollutants on maturation signs and pubertal stages and confirmed the association of organohalogens and phthalates with early puberty. Conclusion: Based on the studied literature, environmental pollutants surround and accumulate in human societies and their adverse health effects are well documented. It can be concluded that organohalogens and phthalates are disturbing the normal process of puberty timing; especially their influence on early maturation in girls should be underscored.

TI Insights into the Anaerobic Biodegradation Pathway of n-Alkanes in Oil
   Reservoirs by Detection of Signature Metabolites
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Anaerobic degradation of alkanes in hydrocarbon-rich environments has been documented and different degradation strategies proposed, of which the most encountered one is fumarate addition mechanism, generating alkylsuccinates as specific biomarkers. However, little is known about the mechanisms of anaerobic degradation of alkanes in oil reservoirs, due to low concentrations of signature metabolites and lack of mass spectral characteristics to allow identification. In this work, we used a multidisciplinary approach combining metabolite profiling and selective gene assays to establish the biodegradation mechanism of alkanes in oil reservoirs. A total of twelve production fluids from three different oil reservoirs were collected and treated with alkali; organic acids were extracted, derivatized with ethanol to form ethyl esters and determined using GC-MS analysis. Collectively, signature metabolite alkylsuccinates of parent compounds from C1 to C8 together with their (putative) downstream metabolites were detected from these samples. Additionally, metabolites indicative of the anaerobic degradation of mono- and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (2-benzylsuccinate, naphthoate, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-naphthoate) were also observed. The detection of alkylsuccinates and genes encoding for alkylsuccinate synthase shows that anaerobic degradation of alkanes via fumarate addition occurs in oil reservoirs. This work provides strong evidence on the in situ anaerobic biodegradation mechanisms of hydrocarbons by fumarate addition.

TI Metabolomic Analysis Reveals Altered Skeletal Muscle Amino Acid and
   Fatty Acid Handling in Obese Humans
SO OBESITY
AB ObjectiveInvestigate the effects of obesity and high-fat diet (HFD) exposure on fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle intermediates and amino acids in skeletal muscle to better characterize energy metabolism.
   MethodsPlasma and skeletal muscle metabolomic profiles were measured from lean and obese males before and after a 5-day HFD in the 4 h postprandial condition.
   ResultsAt both time points, plasma short-chain acylcarnitine species (SCAC) were higher in the obese subjects, while the amino acids glycine, histidine, methionine, and citrulline were lower in skeletal muscle of obese subjects. Skeletal muscle medium-chain acylcarnitines (MCAC) C6, C8, C10:2, C10:1, C10, and C12:1 increased in obese subjects, but decreased in lean subjects, from pre- to post-HFD. Plasma content of C10:1 was also decreased in the lean but increased in the obese subjects from pre- to post-HFD. CD36 increased from pre- to post-HFD in obese but not lean subjects.
   ConclusionsLower skeletal muscle amino acid content and accumulation of plasma SCAC in obese subjects could reflect increased anaplerosis for TCA cycle intermediates, while accumulation of MCAC suggests limitations in -oxidation. These measures may be important markers of or contributors to dysregulated metabolism observed in skeletal muscle of obese humans.

TI Metabolic flux analysis of Escherichia coli MG1655 under octanoic acid
   (C8) stress
SO APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Systems metabolic engineering has made the renewable production of industrial chemicals a feasible alternative to modern operations. One major example of a renewable process is the production of carboxylic acids, such as octanoic acid (C8), from Escherichia coli, engineered to express thioesterase enzymes. C8, however, is toxic to E. coli above a certain concentration, which limits the final titer. C-13 metabolic flux analysis of E. coli was performed for both C8 stress and control conditions using NMR2Flux with isotopomer balancing. A mixture of labeled and unlabeled glucose was used as the sole carbon source for bacterial growth for C-13 flux analysis. By comparing the metabolic flux maps of the control condition and C8 stress condition, pathways that were altered under the stress condition were identified. C8 stress was found to reduce carbon flux in several pathways: the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the CO2 production, and the pyruvate dehydrogenase pathway. Meanwhile, a few pathways became more active: the pyruvate oxidative pathway, and the extracellular acetate production. These results were statistically significant for three biological replicates between the control condition and C8 stress. As a working hypothesis, the following causes are proposed to be the main causes for growth inhibition and flux alteration for a cell under stress: membrane disruption, low activity of electron transport chain, and the activation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase regulator (PdhR).

TI Environmental chemicals and DNA methylation in adults: a systematic
   review of the epidemiologic evidence
SO CLINICAL EPIGENETICS
AB Current evidence supports the notion that environmental exposures are associated with DNA-methylation and expression changes that can impact human health. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of epidemiologic studies evaluating the association between environmental chemicals with DNA methylation levels in adults. After excluding arsenic, recently evaluated in a systematic review, we identified a total of 17 articles (6 on cadmium, 4 on lead, 2 on mercury, 1 on nickel, 1 on antimony, 1 on tungsten, 5 on persistent organic pollutants and perfluorinated compounds, 1 on bisphenol A, and 3 on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). The selected articles reported quantitative methods to determine DNA methylation including immunocolorimetric assays for total content of genomic DNA methylation, and microarray technologies, methylation-specific quantitative PCR, Luminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA), and bisulfite pyrosequencing for DNA methylation content of genomic sites such as gene promoters, LINE-1, Alu elements, and others. Considering consistency, temporality, strength, dose-response relationship, and biological plausibility, we concluded that the current evidence is not sufficient to provide inference because differences across studies and limited samples sizes make it difficult to compare across studies and to evaluate sources of heterogeneity. Important questions for future research include the need for larger and longitudinal studies, the validation of findings, and the systematic evaluation of the dose-response relationships. Future studies should also consider the evaluation of epigenetic marks recently in the research spotlight such as DNA hydroxymethylation and the role of underlying genetic variants.

TI Degradation of TAIC by water falling film dielectric barrier discharge -
   Influence of radical scavengers
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB This work describes the application of plasma generated by water falling film dielectric barrier discharge for the degradation of triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC). The results indicated that TAIC solution of 1000 mg/L was effectively removed within 60 min treatment at 120W output power. Six intermediates were identified and a possible evolution of the TAIC degradation process was continuously proposed basing on the results of mass spectrum analysis. The effects of metal ions and radical scavengers were investigated. Results showed that whatever hydrogen radical scavengers (carbon tetrachloride, perfluorooctane) or hydroxyl radical scavengers (iso-propyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol) all could further enhance the degradation processes, and both kings of radical scavengers could promote the generation of H2O2. In the present study, we employed a novel method by introducing the mixed additives of Fe2+ and radical scavengers into the plasma. It was found that the reaction rate constant and energy efficiency were improved by 309.2% and 387.8%, respectively. Among the mixed additives, Fe2+ could promote the decomposition and increase the oxidizing power of H2O2, which is generated from the plasma discharge and greatly enhanced by the radical scavengers.

TI Persistent organic pollutants and obesity: are they potential mechanisms
   for breast cancer promotion?
SO ENDOCRINE-RELATED CANCER
AB Dietary ingestion of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is correlated with the development of obesity. Obesity alters metabolism, induces an inflammatory tissue microenvironment, and is also linked to diabetes and breast cancer risk/promotion of the disease. However, no direct evidence exists with regard to the correlation among all three of these factors ( POPs, obesity, and breast cancer). Herein, we present results from current correlative studies indicating a causal link between POP exposure through diet and their bioaccumulation in adipose tissue that promotes the development of obesity and ultimately influences breast cancer development and/or progression. Furthermore, as endocrine disruptors, POPs could interfere with hormonally responsive tissue functions causing dysregulation of hormone signaling and cell function. This review highlights the critical need for advanced in vitro and in vivo model systems to elucidate the complex relationship among obesity, POPs, and breast cancer, and, more importantly, to delineate their multifaceted molecular, cellular, and biochemical mechanisms. Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies directly testing the observed correlations as well as detailing their molecular mechanisms are vital to cancer research and, ultimately, public health.

TI Creating a gold standard surgical device: scientific discoveries leading
   to TVT and beyond
SO INTERNATIONAL UROGYNECOLOGY JOURNAL
AB The discovery of tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) began in 1986 with two unrelated observations: pressure applied unilaterally at the midurethra controlled urine loss on coughing; implanted Teflon tape caused a collagenous tissue reaction.
   In 1987, Mersilene tape was implanted retropubically in 13 large dogs, with the aim of creating an artificial collagenous pubourethral neoligament. Extensive testing showed that the operation was safe and effective. In 1988-1989, human testing was carried out (n = 30). Mersilene tape cured 100 % of stress and mixed incontinence with a sling in situ; however, there was simultaneous recurrence of the two symptoms in 50 % on sling removal. X-rays showed no elevation of the bladder neck.
   In 1990-1993, collaboration with Ulf Ulmsten took place: a permanently implanted tape was required. Polypropylene was the ideal material. In 2003, the neoligament principle was applied as an adjustable "micro" sling to the arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis (ATFP), cardinal, uterosacral ligaments, and perineal body for cure of cystocele, rectocele, and apical prolapse. It was found that symptoms such as urgency, nocturia, chronic pelvic pain, obstructive defecation syndrome (ODS), and fecal incontinence were frequently cured or improved.
   The lecture concluded with advice to younger members. Without new paradigms, there are no randomized controlled trials, no meta-analyses, Cochrane. Indeed, no progress. Be open to new concepts. Read Kuhn's "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" to understand the discovery process. Examine the relationship among symptoms, ATFP, cardinal, uterosacral ligaments, and the perineal body. This is the next paradigm. Don't disregard anomalies. Pursue them. They are the pathway to discovery. Innovation is born from challenge, not conformity. Persist, even when meeting resistance. Resistance is a sign that your discovery is important.

TI Methodology for studying biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl precursors
   in the environment
SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl precursors contributes in part to the perfluoroalkyl carboxylates and sulfonates detected in the global environment and biota. Robust sample preparation and sensitive analytical techniques for maximum analyte recovery are essential to identify and to quantify biotransformation products often present at low levels in environmental matrices and experimental systems. This critical review covers current sample-preparation and analytical methods, including extraction, concentration, clean-up and derivatization, mass spectrometry coupled to gas or liquid chromatography, and radioisotope labeling and tracking techniques. We also critically review methodologies for molecular structural elucidation and in-silico prediction of potential transformation products. We describe current knowledge gaps and challenges in studying novel alternative polyfluoroalkyl substances. We discuss future trends on utilizing advanced analytical techniques.

TI Influence of the two-layer preservation method on human pancreatic islet
   isolation: a meta-analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL ORGANS
AB Introduction: There has been continuous debate on whether the Two-Layer Method (TLM) is superior to the University of Wisconsin solution (UW) for preserving human pancreas prior to islet isolation. The objective of the current meta-analysis is to assess which method is superior.
   Methods: We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) for relevant human trials published in the English language from January 2000 to October 2013. Data on donor characteristics and islet isolation outcomes were extracted.
   Results: 14 articles containing 18 human studies were included in this meta-analysis. In comparison to UW alone, TLM alone produced a significantly higher islet yield (weighted mean difference, 776.32; 95% confidence interval; 370.82-1181.82; P =.0002). TLM alone also yielded higher proportion of transplantable preparations (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval; 1.15-2.23; P =.005). The following measures did not differ: islet viability (weighted mean difference, 2.10; -2.41-6.60; P = .360), purity (weighted mean difference, -0.92; -3.75-1.91; P = .520) and function assessed by measuring the stimulation index (weighted mean difference, 0.17; -0.21-0.55; P = .380). When comparing TLM following UW storage with UW alone, the results were similar to the previous ones.
   Conclusions: This data indicates that the TLM can improve islet yield and increase the opportunities of human pancreatic islet transplantation. Therefore, the TLM should be recommended for preserving human pancreas prior to islet isolation.

TI Advances in metal-assisted non-electrophilic fluoroalkylation reactions
   of organic compounds
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB Metal-assisted trifluoromethylation and perfluoroalkylation reactions are probably one of the first approaches employed to achieve fluoroalkyl-group substitutions of organic substrates through the use of metals such as copper. Fluoroalkylation reactions of both aromatic and aliphatic substrates involving the employment of perfluoroalkyl halides RfX in conjunction with metallic species, and nucleophilic fluoroalkylating reagents in the presence of metals or organometallic species will be studied. Fluoroalkylation reactions utilizing electrophilic fluoroalkylating reagents in the presence of transition metals or trifluoromethylthiolation reactions will not be the subject of this article. Recently emerging literature (2011 present), with special emphasis on updates from previous review articles on the metal-mediated fluoroalkylation of aromatic substrates will be dealt with.

TI Advances in Transition-Metal-Mediated Di- and Monofluoroalkylations
SO ACTA CHIMICA SINICA
AB Transition-metal-mediated fluoroalicylation is a hot research topic in current organofluorine chemistry. In the past five years, due to the development of new perfluoroallcylation reagents and methodologies, significant progress has been made in the field of transition-metal-mediated perfluoroalkylation. Compared with perfluoroallcylation, di- and monofluoroalkylation can not only introduce fluorine atom(s) into a molecule, but also install a non-fluorinated moiety simultaneously; therefore, in organic synthesis, these reactions are of higher step economy than the direct fluorination reactions. Although analogous to transition-metal-mediated perfluoroallcylations, the di- and monofluoroallcylation have been relatively less developed; therefore, there are still many opportunities for their development. In this review, we have made a survey on transition-metal-mediated di- and monofluoroalkylation reactions that were published in the past nearly 30 years. To our knowledge, this is the first rather comprehensive review on this topic. This review is divided into five sections. The first section is the general introduction on di- and monofluoroalkylation. The second and third sections focus on the historical development of transition-metal-mediated di- and monofluoroallcylation with reagents that contain functional groups. These two sections are subdivided according to the reactions types, that is, fluoroalkylation of unsaturated organohalides, fluoroalkylation of the carbon-hydrogen bonds of unsaturated systems (arenes, alkenes, alkynes, and carbonyl compounds), fluoroalkylation of organoborane reagents and organometallic reagents, fluoroallcyl addition to unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds. The fourth section puts an emphasis on the transition-metal-promoted di- and monofluoromethylation reactions. The final section gives some perspectives on the future development of this chemistry.

TI New developments in the extraction and determination of parabens in
   cosmetics and environmental samples. A review
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB Parabens are a family of synthetic esters of p-hydroxibenzoic acid widely used as preservatives in cosmetics and health-care products, among other daily-use commodities. Recently, their potential endocrine disrupting effects have raised concerns about their safety and their potential effects as emerging pollutants, leading to the regulation of the presence of parabens in commercial products by national and trans-national organizations. Also, this has led to an interest in developing sensible and reliable methods for their determination in environmental samples, cosmetics and health-care products. This paper is a comprehensive up-to-date review of the literature concerning the determination of parabens in environmental samples and cosmetic and health-care products. A brief revision of the literature concerning the traditional determination of parabens (1980-2003) is included, followed by an in-depth revision of the recent developments in both measurement and extraction methods for parabens in the last years (2003-2013). Finally, possible future perspectives in this field are proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of Medium-Chain Triglycerides on Weight Loss and Body
   Composition: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS
AB Background Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) may result in negative energy balance and weight loss through increased energy expenditure and lipid oxidation. However, results from human intervention studies investigating the weight reducing potential of MCTs, have been mixed.
   Objective To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of MCTs, specifically C8:0 and C10:0, to long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) on weight loss and body composition in adults. Changes in blood lipid levels were secondary outcomes.
   Methods Randomized controlled trials >3 weeks' duration conducted in healthy adults were identified searching Web of Knowledge, Discover, PubMed, Scopus, New Zealand Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL until March 2014 with no language restriction. Identified trials were assessed for bias. Mean differences were pooled and analyzed using inverse variance models with fixed effects. Heterogeneity between studies was calculated using I-2 statistic. An I-2>50% or P<0.10 indicated heterogeneity.
   Results Thirteen trials (n=749) were identified. Compared with LCTs, MCTs decreased body weight (-0.51 kg [95% CI -0.80 to -0.23 kg]; P<0.001; I-2=35%); waist circumference (-1.46 cm [95% CI -2.04 to -0.87 cm]; P<0.001; I-2=0%), hip circumference (-0.79 cm [95% CI -1.27 to -0.30 cm]; P=0.002; I-2=0%), total body fat (standard mean difference -0.39 [95% CI -0.57 to -0.22]; P<0.001; I-2=0%), total subcutaneous fat (standard mean difference -0.46 [95% CI -0.64 to -0.27]; P<0.001; I-2=20%), and visceral fat (standard mean difference -0.55 [95% CI -0.75 to -0.34]; P<0.001; I-2=0%). No differences were seen in blood lipid levels. Many trials lacked sufficient information for a complete quality assessment, and commercial bias was detected. Although heterogeneity was absent, study designs varied with regard to duration, dose, and control of energy intake.
   Conclusions Replacement of LCTs with MCTs in the diet could potentially induce modest reductions in body weight and composition without adversely affecting lipid profiles. However, further research is required by independent research groups using large, well-designed studies to confirm the efficacy of MCT and to determine the dosage needed for the management of a healthy body weight and composition.

TI LC-MS analysis of the plasma metabolome-A novel sample preparation
   strategy
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL
   AND LIFE SCIENCES
AB Blood plasma is a well-known body fluid often analyzed in studies on the effects of toxic compounds as physiological or chemical induced changes in the mammalian body are reflected in the plasma metabolome. Sample preparation prior to LC-MS based analysis of the plasma metabolome is a challenge as plasma contains compounds with very different properties. Besides, proteins, which usually are precipitated with organic solvent, phospholipids, are known to cause ion suppression in electrospray mass spectrometry.
   We have compared two different sample preparation techniques prior to LC-gTOF analysis of plasma samples: the first is protein precipitation; the second is protein precipitation followed by solid phase extraction with sub-fractionation into three sub-samples: a phospholipid, a lipid and a polar sub-fraction. Molecular feature extraction of the data files from LC-qTOF analysis of the samples revealed 1792 molecular features from the protein precipitation procedure. The protein precipitation followed by solid phase extraction procedure with three sub-samples gave a total of 4234 molecular features. This suggests that sub-sampling into polar, lipid and phospholipid fractions enables extraction of more metabolomic information as compared to protein precipitation alone. Chromatography showed good separation of the metabolites with little retention time drift (<1 s) and a mass accuracy below 3 ppm was observed. The performance of the method was investigated using plasma samples from rats administered the environmental pollutant perfluorononanoic acid. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The SOLUTIONS project: Challenges and responses for present and future
   emerging pollutants in land and water resources management
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB SOLUTIONS (2013 to 2018) is a European Union Seventh Framework Programme Project (EU-FP7). The project aims to deliver a conceptual framework to support the evidence-based development of environmental policies with regard to water quality. SOLUTIONS will develop the tools for the identification, prioritisation and assessment of those water contaminants that may pose a risk to ecosystems and human health. To this end, a new generation of chemical and effect-based monitoring tools is developed and integrated with a full set of exposure, effect and risk assessment models. SOLUTIONS attempts to address legacy, present and future contamination by integrating monitoring and modelling based approaches with scenarios on future developments in society, economy and technology and thus in contamination. The project follows a solutions-oriented approach by addressing major problems of water and chemicals management and by assessing abatement options. SOLUTIONS takes advantage of the access to the infrastructure necessary to investigate the large basins of the Danube and Rhine as well as relevant Mediterranean basins as case studies, and puts major efforts on stakeholder dialogue and support. Particularly, the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) Common Implementation Strategy (CIS) working groups, International River Commissions, and water works associations are directly supported. with consistent guidance for the early detection, identification, prioritisation, and abatement of chemicals in the water cycle. SOLUTIONS will give a specific emphasis on concepts and tools for the impact and risk assessment of complex mixtures of emerging pollutants, their metabolites and transformation products. Analytical and effect-based screening tools will be applied together with ecological assessment tools for the identification of toxicants and their impacts.

TI Fetal growth and maternal glomerular filtration rate: a systematic
   review
SO JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE
AB Objective: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may influence concentrations of biomarkers of exposure and their etiologic significance in observational studies of associations between environmental contaminants and fetal growth. It is unknown whether the size of a developing fetus affects maternal GFR such that a small fetus leads to reduced plasma volume expansion (PVE), reduced GFR and subsequent higher concentrations of biomarkers in maternal serum. Our objective was to answer the question: "Is there an association between fetal growth and maternal GFR in humans?''
   Methods: We adapted and applied the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology to assess the evidence of an association between fetal growth and GFR, either directly or indirectly via reduction in PVE.
   Results: We identified 35 relevant studies. We rated 31 human and two non-human observational studies as "low'' quality and two experimental non-human studies as "very low'' quality. We rated all three evidence streams as "inadequate''. The association between fetal growth and GFR was "not classifiable'' according to pre-specified definitions.
   Conclusions: There is currently insufficient evidence to support the plausibility of a reverse causality hypothesis for associations between exposure to environmental chemicals during pregnancy and fetal growth. Further research would be needed to confirm or disprove this hypothesis.

AB The assessment of the quality of the marine environment and marine mollusks was carried-out in 2013 in the four designated areas for the growth and commercial exploitation in the Romanian Black Sea coast, according to the Directive 2006/113 EC.
   Physical, chemical and biological factors of the marine environment, water and sediment in living mollusks (water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, total hydrocarbons, organohalogenated substances-pesticides, heavy metals, faecal coliforms) were analysed by the analytical methods set out in Annex to Directive No 2006/113/EC and Government Order No 201/2002.
   The main species monitored were the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the rapa welk Rapana venosa.
   Total suspended solids had overall low values without impact on water quality.
   Water temperature was not influenced by point discharges. Salinity evinced values below the minimum recommended threshold of 12% in all areas. Dissolved oxygen filled well to the requirements in all areas (100%). The presence of petroleum hydrocarbons films was visually assessed, but was not reported within the investigated areas. Organohalogenated substances (pesticides) were identified both in water and sediments but within concentrations allowed by Ministerial Order No 1888/2007. Heavy metals concentration in seawater, except Ni (80% compliance) in area 3 and Cr in area 4 (90% compliance) was according to the requirements. Overall organohalogenated substances and heavy metals contamination was extremely low and their concentration in mollusks meat did not present a threat for human consumption.
   Faecal coliforms were present in mollusks at concentrations below the threshold.

SE Topics in Organometallic Chemistry
AB Activation of the C-F bond by transition-metal catalysts not only advances fundamental understanding of the formation and reactivity of organometallic fluoride complexes but also provides a potential approach to partially fluorinated organic compounds from readily available perfluorinated bulk chemicals. Hydrodefluorination (HDF) is regarded as a simple but important reaction among various C-F functionalizations, which features a mechanistic diversity as model reactions for C-F bond activations. Following Lentz and Braun's review (Angew Chem Int Ed 52, 3328-3348, 2013), we review transition-metal-mediated HDF reactions according to periodic table from group 3-12 metals.

TI A Kinetic Insight into the Activation of n-Octane with Alkaline-Earth

SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY-SUID-AFRIKAANSE TYDSKRIF VIR CHEMIE
AB Alkaline-earth metal hydroxyapatites are prepared by the co-precipitation method and characterized using XRD, ICP, NH3-TPD, SEM-EDX, TEM and N-2 physisorption analysis. The metal present in the hydroxyapatite influences the acidity of the catalyst. Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions carried out in a continuous flow fixed bed reactor showed that the selectivity towards desired products was dependent on the alkaline-earth metal in the hydroxyapatite. All hydroxyapatite catalysts showed high selectivity towards carbon oxides, followed by cracked products, octenes and aromatics. The highest selectivity and turnover numbers towards C8 products and a high specific rate was shown by Sr-HAp. The activation of n-octane over these catalysts followed the Eley-Rideal mechanism.

TI Size dependent ion-exchange of large mixed-metal complexes into Nafion
   (R) membranes
SO POLYMER CHEMISTRY
AB Perfluorosulfonate ionomers have been shown to demonstrate a profound affinity for large cationic complexes, and the exchange of these ions may be used to provide insight regarding Nafion (R) morphology by contrasting molecular size with existing morphological models. The trimetallic complex, [{(bpy)(2)Ru(dpp)}(2)RhBr2](5+), is readily absorbed by ion-exchange into Na+-form Nafion((R)) membranes under ambient conditions. The dimensions of three different isomers of the trimetallic complex were found to be: 23.6 angstrom x 13.3 angstrom x 10.8 angstrom, 18.9 angstrom x 18.0 angstrom x 13.7 angstrom, and 23.1 angstrom x 12.0 angstrom x 11.4 angstrom, yielding an average molecular volume of 1.2 x 10(3) angstrom(3). At equilibrium, the partition coefficient for the ion-exchange of the trimetallic complex into Nafion (R) from a DMF solution was found to be 5.7 x 10(3). Furthermore, the total cationic charge of the exchanged trimetallic complexes was found to counterbalance 86 +/- 2% of the anionic SO3- sites in Nafion (R). The characteristic dimensions of morphological models for the ionic domains in Nafion (R) were found to be comparable to the molecular dimensions of the large mixed-metal complexes. Surprisingly, SAXS analysis indicated that the complexes absorbed into the ionic domains of Nafion (R) without significantly changing the ionomer morphology. Given the profound affinity for absorption of these large cationic molecules, a more open-channel model for the morphology of perfluorosulfonate ionomers is more reasonable, in agreement with recent experimental findings. In contrast to smaller monometallic complexes, the time dependent uptake of the large trimetallic cations was found to be biexponential. This behavior is attributed to a fast initial ion-exchange process on the surface of the membrane, accompanied by a slower transport-limited ion-exchange for exchange sites that are buried further in the ionomer matrix.

TI A meta-analysis of fast track surgery for patients with gastric cancer
   undergoing gastrectomy
SO ANNALS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND
AB INTRODUCTION This meta-analysis evaluated the safety and efficacy of fast track surgery (FTS) for patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy.
   METHODS
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1 January 1995 and 21 June 2013 comparing FTS with conventional perioperative care for patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy were identified in the PubMed, EmbaseTM and Cochrane Library databases, and were analysed systematically using RevMan software (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark).
   RESULTS
   Seven RCTs (524 patients) were analysed. Compared with conventional perioperative care, FTS treatment with/without laparoscopy was associated with shorter postoperative hospitalisation, less hospitalisation expenditure (both p<0.00001), less pain and better quality of life. Short-term morbidity and readmission rates did not differ between treatments. No incidents of death occurred during the short-term follow-up period.
   CONCLUSIONS
   In patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy, the FTS pathway reduces the length and cost of postoperative hospitalisation while maintaining short-term morbidity, readmission and mortality rates comparable with those of conventional care.

TI Formation mechanisms of trichloromethyl-containing compounds in the
   terrestrial environment: A critical review
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Natural trichloromethyl compounds present in the terrestrial environment are important contributors to chlorine in the lower atmosphere and may be also a cause for concern when high concentrations are detected in soils and groundwater. During the last decade our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the formation of these compounds has grown. This critical review summarizes our current understanding and uncertainties on the mechanisms leading to the formation of natural trichlorormethyl compounds. The objective of the review is to gather information regarding the natural processes that lead to the formation of trichloromethyl compounds and then to compare these mechanisms with the much more comprehensive literature on the reactions occurring during chemical chlorination of organic material. It turns out that the reaction mechanisms during chemical chlorination are likely to be similar to those occurring naturally and that significant knowledge may therefore be transferred between the scientific disciplines of chemical chlorination and natural organohalogens. There is however still a need for additional research before we understand fully the mechanisms occurring during the formation of natural trichloromethyl compounds and open questions and future research needs are identified in the last part of the review.

TI Metabonomic study of biochemical changes in urinary of type 2 diabetes

   based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
SO BIOMEDICAL CHROMATOGRAPHY
AB A metabonomic study on biochemical changes in the urine of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients after the treatment of sulfonylurea (SU) antidiabetic drugs was performed. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS) method was used to generate metabolic fingerprints for the metabonomic analysis of urinary samples obtained from 20 T2DM patients without any drug treatment and 20 T2DM patients treated with SU antidiabetic drugs and 20 normal glucose tolerance subjects. The resulting data were subjected to chemometric analysis (principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis) to investigate the effect of SU antidiabetic drugs on urinary metabolite profiles of T2DM patients. Biomarkers such as xanthine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, hippurate, phenylacetylglutamine, carnitine C8:1, carnitine C10:3, uric acid and citrate were found to be responsible for the separation of T2DM and SU-treated groups, which indicates a potential effect of SU on energy metabolism, Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, gut microflora metabolism and oxidative stress. The study may be helpful to the understanding of the action of mechanism of SU antidiabetic drugs. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Meta-analysis of contrast-enhanced ultrasound for the differentiation of
   benign and malignant breast lesions
SO ACTA RADIOLOGICA
AB Background: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a non-invasive method for the assessment of breast lesions. The accuracy of CEUS in diagnosing of breast cancer has never been systematically assessed.
   Purpose: To determine the overall performance of CEUS in the differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions using meta-analysis.
   Material and Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and article references published before October 2012 were searched. Published studies that used histopathologic results as golden reference to assess the diagnostic performance of CEUS in patients suspected of having breast cancer and the data necessary to calculate the diagnostic results were included. The qualities of eligible studies for final meta-analysis were assessed by using the quality assessment of diagnostic studies (QUADAS) instrument. Sensitivity, specificity, summary receiver-operating characteristic (sROC) curves, and area under the curve were calculated to examine the diagnostic performance of CEUS.
   Results: Of 16 eligible studies, 957 breast lesions were included in the original meta-analysis, among which heterogeneity arising from factors other than threshold effect was explored. Meta-regression analysis confirmed the contrast agent was the most significant factor cause of heterogeneity (P = 0.0012, relative diagnostic odds ratio [DOR] = 7.06). The use of perfluoro containing microbubbles (Sonovue or Optison) significantly increased the diagnostic precision compared with Levovist. The pooled weighted estimates of sensitivity and specificity for CEUS in the diagnosis of breast lesions were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83, 0.89) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75, 0.83), respectively.
   Conclusion: CEUS has good sensitivity and specificity in the characterization of breast lesions and can potentially help to select suspicious breast mass for surgery.

TI Application of Bioinformatics Tools and Databases in Microbial
   Dehalogenation Research: a Review
SO APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND MICROBIOLOGY
AB Microbial dehalogenation is a biochemical process in which the halogenated substances are catalyzed enzymatically in to their non-halogenated form. The microorganisms have a wide range of organohalogen degradation ability both explicit and non-specific in nature. Most of these halogenated organic compounds being pollutants need to be remediated; therefore, the current approaches are to explore the potential of microbes at a molecular level for effective biodegradation of these substances. Several microorganisms with dehalogenation activity have been identified and characterized. In this aspect, the bioinformatics plays a key role to gain deeper knowledge in this field of dehalogenation. To facilitate the data mining, many tools have been developed to annotate these data from databases. Therefore, with the discovery of a microorganism one can predict a gene/protein, sequence analysis, can perform structural modelling, metabolic pathway analysis, biodegradation study and so on. This review highlights various methods of bioinformatics approach that describes the application of various databases and specific tools in the microbial dehalogenation fields with special focus on dehalogenase enzymes. Attempts have also been made to decipher some recent applications of in silico modeling methods that comprise of gene finding, protein modelling, Quantitative Structure Biodegradibility Relationslup (QSBR) study and reconstruction of metabolic pathways employed in dehalogenation research area.

TI A unified survey of Si-H and H-H bond activation catalysed by
   electron-deficient boranes
SO CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
AB The bond activation chemistry of B(C6F5)(3) and related electron-deficient boranes is currently experiencing a renaissance due to the fascinating development of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). B(C6F5)(3)'s ability to catalytically activate Si-H bonds through eta(1) coordination opened the door to several unique reduction processes. The ground-breaking finding that the same family of fully or partially fluorinated boron Lewis acids allows for the related H-H bond activation, either alone or as a component of an FLP, brought considerable momentum into the area of transition-metal-free hydrogenation and, likewise, hydrosilylation. This review comprehensively summarises synthetic methods involving borane-catalysed Si-H and H-H bond activation. Systems corresponding to an FLP-type situation are not covered. Aside from the broad manifold of C=X bond reductions and C=X/C-X defunctionalisations, dehydrogenative (oxidative) Si-H couplings are also included.

TI Tracking humanitarian funding for reproductive health: a systematic
   analysis of health and protection proposals from 2002-2013
SO CONFLICT AND HEALTH
AB Background: The Inter-agency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crises conducted a ten-year global evaluation of reproductive health in humanitarian settings. This paper examines proposals for reproductive health activities under humanitarian health and protection funding mechanisms for 2002-2013, and the level at which these reproductive health proposals were funded.
   Methods: The study used English and French health and protection proposal data for 2002-2013, extracted from the Financial Tracking Service (FTS) database managed by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Every project was reviewed for relevance against pre-determined reproductive health definitions for 2002-2008. An in-depth analysis was additionally conducted for 2009-2013 through systematically reviewing proposals via a key word search and subsequently classifying them under designated reproductive health categories. Among the relevant reproductive health proposals, counts and proportions were calculated in Excel based on their reproductive health components, primarily by year. Contributions, requests, and unfunded requests were calculated based on the data provided by FTS.
   Results: Among the 11,347 health and protection proposals issued from 345 emergencies between 2002 and 2013, 3,912 were relevant to reproductive health (34.5%). The number of proposals containing reproductive health activities increased by an average of 21.9% per year, while the proportion of health and protection sector appeals containing reproductive health activities increased by an average of 10.1% per year. The total funding request over the 12 years amounted to $4.720 billion USD, of which $ 2.031 billion USD was received. Among reproductive health components for 2009-2013 proposals, maternal newborn health comprised the largest proportion (56.4%), followed by reproductive health-related gender-based violence (45.9%), HIV/sexually transmitted infections (37.5%), general reproductive health (26.2%), and lastly, family planning (14.9%).
   Conclusion: Findings show that more agencies are responding to humanitarian appeals by proposing to implement reproductive health programs and receiving increased aid over the twelve year period. While such developments are welcome, project descriptions show comparatively limited attention and programming for family planning and abortion care in particular.

TI Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and human fetal growth: A
   systematic review
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY
AB Background : Exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) is ubiquitous in most regions of the world. The most commonly studied PFASs are perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Animal studies indicate that maternal PFAS exposure is associated with reduced fetal growth. However, the results of human studies are inconsistent. Objectives: To summarize the evidence of an association between exposure to PFASs, particularly PFOS and PFOA, and human fetal growth. Methods : Systematic literature searches were performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE. We included original studies on pregnant women with measurements of PFOA or PFOS in maternal blood during pregnancy or the umbilical cord and associations with birth weight or related outcomes according to the PFAS level. Citations and references from the included articles were investigated to locate more relevant articles. Study characteristics and results were extracted to structured tables. The completeness of reporting as well as the risk of bias and confounding were assessed. Results : Fourteen studies were eligible. In utero PFOA exposure was associated with decreased measures of continuous birth weight in all studies, even though the magnitude of the association differed and many results were statistically insignificant. PFOS exposure and birth weight were associated in some studies, while others found no association. Conclusions: Higher PFOS and PFOA concentrations were associated with decreased average birth weight in most studies, but only some results were statistically significant. The impact on public health is unclear, but the global exposure to PFASs warrants further investigation.

TI Lithium salts for advanced lithium batteries: Li-metal, Li-O-2, and Li-S
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Presently lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) is the dominant Li-salt used in commercial rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) based on a graphite anode and a 3-4 V cathode material. While LiPF6 is not the ideal Li-salt for every important electrolyte property, it has a uniquely suitable combination of properties (temperature range, passivation, conductivity, etc.) rendering it the overall best Li-salt for LIBs. However, this may not necessarily be true for other types of Li-based batteries. Indeed, next generation batteries, for example lithium-metal (Li-metal), lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2), and lithium-sulfur (Li-S), require a re-evaluation of Li-salts due to the different electrochemical and chemical reactions and conditions within such cells. This review explores the critical role Li-salts play in ensuring in these batteries viability.

TI What is the effect of phasing out long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances on the concentrations of perfluoroalkyl acids and their
   precursors in the environment? A systematic review protocol
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE
AB Background: There is a growing concern in Sweden and elsewhere that continued emissions of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may cause environmental as well as human health effects. PFASs are a broad class of man-made substances that have been produced and used in both commercial products and industrial processes for more than 60 years. Although the production and use of some PFASs has been phased-out in some parts of the world, it is not known what effect these actions to date have had on PFAS concentrations in the environment. Owing to the wide diversity of PFASs, it is difficult to generalize their properties, environmental fate and production histories. However, the strength and stability of the C-F bond renders the perfluoroalkyl moieties resistant to heat and environmental degradation. Several PFASs are now occurring even in very remote areas in large parts of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of substances within this group is not well understood. A systematic review may be able to determine whether the concentrations of these substances in different environments are changing in any particular direction with time, and whether the phase-outs have had any effects on the concentration trends.
   Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations in the environment will be performed in the scientific literature as well as in other reports. Relevant samples include both abiotic and biological samples including humans. No particular time, document type, language or geographical constraints will be applied. Two authors will screen all retrieved articles. Double screening of about 10% of the articles will be performed by all authors at both title/abstract and full-text levels. Kappa tests will be used to test if the screening is consistent. Relevant articles will be critically appraised by four authors (double checking of 25% of the articles). Quality assessment will focus on selection bias, dating of samples, sample integrity and analytical procedures. Data synthesis will be based on statistical analysis of temporal concentration trends.

TI Assessing emerging wastewater regulations to minimize the risk from
   pharmaceuticals and personal care products A case study in Wisconsin,
   USA
SO MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB Purpose - Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and phosphorus are pollutants that can cause a wide array of negative environmental impacts. Phosphorus is a regulated pollutant in many industrial countries, while PPCPs are widely unregulated. Many technologies designed to remove phosphorus from wastewater can remove PPCPs, therefore the purpose of this paper is to explore the ability of these technologies to also reduce the emission of unregulated PPCPs.
   Design/methodology/approach - Through meta-analysis, the authors use the PPCPs' risk quotient (RQ) to measure and compare the effectiveness of different wastewater treatment technologies. The RQ data are then applied via a case study that uses phosphorus effluent regulations to determine the ability of the recommended technologies to also mitigate PPCPs.
   Findings - The tertiary membrane bioreactor and nanofiltration processes recommended to remove phosphorus can reduce the median RQ from PPCPs by 71 and 81 percent, respectively. The ultrafiltration technology was estimated to reduce the median RQ from PPCPs by 28 percent with no cost in addition to the costs expected under the current phosphorus effluent regulations. RQ reduction is expected with a membrane bioreactor and the cost of upgrading to this technology was found to be $11.76 per capita/year.
   Practical implications - The authors discuss the management implications, including watershed management, alternative PPCPs reduction strategies, and water quality trading.
   Originality/value - The evaluation of the co-management of priority and emerging pollutants illuminates how the removal of regulated pollutants from wastewater could significantly reduce the emission of unregulated PPCPs.

TI Proximal femoral nails antirotation, Gamma nails, and dynamic hip screws
   for fixation of intertrochanteric fractures of femur: A meta-analysis
SO ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH
AB Background: Which surgical strategy is the best one for intertrochanteric fractures remains a controversial issue. Dynamic hip screw (DHS) and Gamma nail were commonly used but often associated with some complications, such as fixation failure and implant-related fractures. Meanwhile, proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA) fixation has recently been developed for minimally invasive surgery to reduce the complications rate. To facilitate the clinical decision-making, we conducted an updated meta-analysis to discuss the optimal treatment of intertrochanteric fractures aiming to determine which implant gives the lower rates of blood loss, complications (pen-implant fracture, fixation failure, infection, thromboembolic), reoperation, and mortality, as well as the minimal duration related to surgery (fluoroscopic exposure, surgery and hospital stay).
   Patients and methods: Seven electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (including OVID, Springer, Google Scholar, PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, and Web of Science). Fourteen studies with 1983 patients were included. The modified Jadad Scale was used to assess the methodological quality of these studies. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Comparison among the three groups was based on twelve indicators, including operative time, fluoroscopy time, operative blood loss, length of hospital stays, wound infection or hematoma, pneumonia, thromboembolic complications, fixation failure, operative fracture of femur, later fracture of femur, reoperation, and mortality.
   Results: (1) PFNA group versus DHS group: PFNA was associated with less blood loss (mean difference (MD) -253.86, 95% CI -270.25 to 237.47; P<0.00001) and lower rate of fixation failure (MD 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.59; P=0.004), but led to more fluoroscopy time (MD 2.11, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.43; P<0.00001). (2) PFNA group versus Gamma nail group: PFNA led to less blood loss (MD -55.30, 95% CI -60.07 to -50.53; P< 0.00001), shorter fluoroscopy time (MD -0.50,95% CI -0.55 to -0.45; P< 0.00001) and length of hospital stay (MD -0.20,95% CI -0.27 to -0.13; P< 0.00001). (3) DHS group versus Gamma nail group: DHS was associated with lower rate of operative fracture of femur (MD 0.31,95% CI 0.11 to 0.89; P= 0.03), later fracture of femur (MD 0.16,95% CI 0.06 to 0.43; P= 0.0004), and reoperation (MD 0.49,95% CI 0.27 to 0.88; P= 0.02), but caused more blood loss (MD 29.49, 95% CI 8.27 to 50.70; P=0.006). In contrast, there was no difference regarding operative time, infection hematoma, pneumonia, thromboembolic events, and mortality.
   Discussion: PFNA should be a priority choice for treatment of intertrochanteric fractures with minimal rate of fixation failure, less blood loss and shorter length of hospital stay. DHS has distinct advantages over Gamma nail with lower rate of plant-related complications and should be preferred device for intertrochanteric fractures. However, owing to the low quality evidence currently available, more highquality RCTs are needed to confirm these findings. Level of evidence: Level II. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI Meta-Analysis of Efficacy and Safety of Fast-Track Surgery in
   Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB Fast-track surgery (FTS) is a promising program for surgical patients and has been applied to several surgical diseases. FTS is much superior to conventional perioperative care. Our aim was to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of FTS and conventional perioperative care for patients undergoing gastrectomy using a systematic review.
   We searched the literature in PubMed, SCOPUS, and EMBASE up to November 2013. No language restriction was applied. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and odds ratios (ORs) with their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were used for analysis by a fixed or a random effects model according to the heterogeneity assumption.
   In the present meta-analysis, we included five randomized controlled trials and one controlled clinical trial from five studies. Compared with conventional care, FTS shortened the duration of flatus (WMD -21.08; 95 % CI -27.46 to -14.71, z = 6.48, p < 0.00001 in the open surgery group; WMD -8.20; 95 % CI -12.87 to -3.53, z = 3.44, p = 0.0006 in the laparoscopic surgery group), accelerated the decrease in C-reactive protein (WMD -15.56; 95 % CI 21.28 to 9.83, z = 5.33, p < 0.00001), shortened the postoperative stay (WMD -2.00; 95 % CI -2.69 to -1.30, z = 5.64, p < 0.00001), and reduced hospitalization costs (WMD -447.72; 95 % CI -615.92 to -279.51, z = 5.22, p < 0.00001). FTS made no significant difference in operation times (p = 0.93), intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.79), or postoperative complications (p = 0.07).
   Based on current evidence, the FTS protocol was feasible for gastric cancer patients who underwent gastrectomy (distal subtotal gastrectomy, proximal subtotal gastrectomy, or radical total gastrectomy) via open or laparoscopic surgery. Larger studies are needed to validate our findings.

TI Progress and perspectives in converting biogas to transportation fuels
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The discovery of abundant natural gas resources has greatly increased the study of using methane as a feedstock to produce transportation fuels. Biogas (primarily containing methane and CO2), which is generated from waste biomass via anaerobic digestion or landfills, is regarded as a renewable source of methane, and has the potential to achieve sustainable production of transportation fuels. Since biogas also contains a significant amount of impurities (e.g., H2S, NH3, and siloxane), a cleaning procedure is generally required prior to conversion to transportation fuels. Physical approaches, mainly compression and liquefaction, have been commercially applied to upgrade biogas to bio-compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied biogas (LBG). For chemical approaches, catalytic reforming is the dominant method for converting methane to syngas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) or fermentation of syngas to a variety of alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, and butanol) and liquid hydrocarbon fuels (e.g., gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels). High purity hydrogen, a clean fuel; can also be produced via reforming. Methanol can be produced by direct oxidation of methane, while interest in the biological conversion of methane to methanol has grown recently due to its mild operating conditions, high conversion efficiency, and potential for using raw biogas. The derived methanol can be further converted to gasoline via a methanol to gasoline (MTG) process. This paper provides a comprehensive review of major research progress on technologies for converting biogas/methane into transportation fuels, and discusses the principles, kinetics, operating conditions, and performance of each technology. Efficient direct conversion of biogas into ethanol and higher alcohol fuels (e.g. butanol), which is envisaged to be the focus of research pursuits in the near future, is also discussed, with emphasis on the development of methane-utilizing microbes through genetic engineering.

TI Cost Effectiveness of Percutaneous Closure Versus Medical Therapy for
   Cryptogenic Stroke in Patients With a Patent Foramen Ovale
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB In patients with patent foramen ovales (PFOs) and cryptogenic stroke, observational studies have demonstrated reductions in recurrent neurologic events with transcatheter PFO closure compared with medical therapy. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have shown a trend toward benefit with device closure. The cost-effectiveness of PFO closure has not been described. Therefore, a detailed cost analysis was performed using pooled weighted outcome and complication rates from published randomized controlled trials, Medicare cost tables, and wholesale medication prices. Incremental cost per life-year gained and per quality-adjusted life-year. (QALY) gained by PFO closure was calculated. The commonly accepted cost-effectiveness threshold of <$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained was used. At 2.6 years (the mean duration of randomized controlled trial follow-up), PFO closure was more costly ($16,213, 95% confidence interval [CI] $15,753 to $16,749) per patient, with a cost of $103,607 (95% CI $5,826 to $2,544,750) per life-year gained. The expenditure to prevent 1 combined end point (transient ischemic attack, stroke, and death) at 2.6 years was $1.09 million (95% CI $1.04 million to $1.20 million). Modeling the costs of medical treatment prospectively, PFO closure reached cost-effectiveness (<$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained) at 2.6 years (95% CI 1.5 to 44.2). At 30.2 years (95% CI 28.2 to 36.2), the per patient mean cost of medical therapy exceeded that of PFO closure. In conclusion, PFO closure is associated with higher expenditures related to procedural costs; however, this increase may be offset over time by reduced event rates and costs of long-term medical treatment in patients who undergo transcatheter PFO closure. In younger patients typical of cryptogenic stroke, PFO closure may be cost effective in the long term. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Safety of fast-track rehabilitation after gastrointestinal surgery:
   Systematic review and meta-analysis
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB AIM: to compare the safety of fast-track rehabilitation protocols (FT) and conventional care strategies (CC), or FT and laparoscopic surgery (LFT) and FT and open surgery (OFT) after gastrointestinal surgery.
   METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, WHO International Trial Register, Embase and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to 2014 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing FT and CC or comparing LFT and OFT, with 10 or more randomized participants and about 30 d follow-up. Two reviewers independently extracted data on complications, anastomotic leak, obstruction, wound infection, re-admission between FT and CC or LFT and OFT after gastrointestinal surgery.
   RESULTS: Twenty-four RCTs of FT vs CC or LFT vs OFT were included. Compared with CC, FT reduced overall complications and wound infection. However, anastomotic leak, obstruction and re-admission were not significantly reduced. The pooled risk ratio (RR) of 0.69 (95%CI: 0.60-0.78; P < 0.001), pooled RR of 0.71 (95%CI: 0.57-0.88; P < 0.001), pooled RR of 0.93 (95%CI: 0.68-1.25; P > 0.05), a pooled RR of 0.87 (95%CI: 0.67-1.15; P > 0.05) and pooled RR of 0.94 (95%CI: 0.73-1.22; P > 0.05) respectively. Compared with OFT, LFT reduced complications, with a pooled RR of 0.66 (95%CI: 0.54-0.81; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSION: FTs are safe after gastrointestinal surgery. Additional large, prospective RCTs should be conducted to establish further the safety of this approach. (C) 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Systematic Review of Proximal Femoral Arthroplasty for Non-Neoplastic
   Conditions
SO JOURNAL OF ARTHROPLASTY
AB Proximal femoral arthroplasty (PFA) is an established treatment modality following oncological resection. Increasingly, these prostheses are being used for non-neoplastic conditions such as fractures and bone loss associated with septic or aseptic loosening. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the failure rates, mortality rates and hip outcome scores when PFAs were used in non-neoplastic conditions. There were 14 studies with an average follow-up of 3.8 years (range 0-14 years) describing 356 PFAs. Re-operation for any reason occurred in 23.8% (85/356) of cases. The most common complications were dislocation (15.7%) and infection (7.6%). The mortality rate ranged from 0% to 40%. PFA provides an acceptable surgical solution when confronted with massive bone loss, but it has a high re-operation rate for dislocation and infection. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Meta-analysis of relationships between enteric methane yield and milk
   fatty acid profile in dairy cattle
SO JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
AB Various studies have indicated a relationship between enteric methane (CH4) production and milk fatty acid (FA) profiles of dairy cattle. However, the number of studies investigating such a relationship is limited and the direct relationships reported are mainly obtained by variation in CH4 production and milk FA concentration induced by dietary lipid supplements. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to quantify relationships between CH4 yield (per unit of feed and unit of milk) and milk FA profile in dairy cattle and to develop equations to predict CH4 yield based on milk FA profile of cows fed a wide variety of diets. Data from 8 experiments encompassing 30 different dietary treatments and 146 observations were included. Yield of CH4 measured in these experiments was 21.5 +/- 2.46 g/kg of dry matter intake (DMI) and 13.9 +/- 2.30 g/kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM). Correlation coefficients were chosen as effect size of the relationship between CH4 yield and individual milk FA concentration (g/100 g of FA). Average true correlation coefficients were estimated by a random-effects model. Milk FA concentrations of C6:0, C8:0, C10:0, C16:0, and C16:0-iso were significantly or tended to be positively related to CH4 yield per unit of feed. Concentrations of trans-6+7+8+9 C18:1, trans-10+11 C18:1, cis-11 C18:1, cis-12 C18:1, cis-13 C18:1, trans-16+cis-14 C18:1, and cis-9,12 C18:2 in milk fat were significantly or tended to be negatively related to CH4 yield per unit of feed. Milk FA concentrations of C10:0, C12:0, C14:0-iso, C14:0, cis-9 C14:1, C15:0, and C16:0 were significantly or tended to be positively related to CH4 yield per unit of milk. Concentrations of C4:0, C18:0, trans-10+11 C18:1, cis-9 C18:1, cis-11 C18:1, and cis-9,12 C18:2 in milk fat were significantly or tended to be negatively related to CH4 yield per unit of milk. Mixed model multiple regression and a stepwise selection procedure of milk FA based on the Bayesian information criterion to predict CH4 yield with milk FA as input (g/100 g of FA) resulted in the following prediction equations: CH4 (g/kg of DMI) = 23.39 + 9.74 x C16:0-iso 1.06 x trans-10+11 C18:1 - 1.75 x cis-9,12 C18:2 (R-2 = 0.54), and CH4 (g/kg of FPCM) = 21.13 - 1.38 x C4:0 + 8.53 x C16:0-iso 0.22 x cis-9 C18:1 - 0.59 x trans-10+11 C18:1 (R-2 = 0.47). This indicated that milk FA profile has a moderate potential for predicting CH4 yield per unit of feed and a slightly lower potential for predicting CH4 yield per unit of milk.

TI Progress in the use of ionic liquids as electrolyte membranes in fuel
   cells
SO JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE
AB This work provides a critical review of the progress in the use of Room Temperature Ionic Liquids (RTILs) as Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolytes in Fuel Cells (FCs). It is well-known that for an efficient early commercialisation of this technology it is necessary to develop a proton exchange membrane with high proton conductivity without water dependency capable of working at temperatures above 100 degrees C. The use of ionic liquids as electrolytes in electrochemical devices is an emerging field due to their high conductivity, as well as their thermal, chemical and electrochemical stability under anhydrous conditions. This paper attempts to give a general overview of the state-of-the-art, identifies the key factors for future research and summarises the recent progress in the use of ionic liquids as an innovative type of PEMs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI Neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioural effects of polybrominated and
   perfluorinated chemicals: A systematic review of the epidemiological
   literature using a quality assessment scheme
SO TOXICOLOGY LETTERS
AB Concerns over effects of halogenated persistent environmental contaminants on the developing brain have been expressed for many years, and human biomonitoring has confirmed that low-level, prenatal and/or postnatal exposure of children to these chemicals is ubiquitous. Over the last decade there have been increasing reports in the epidemiological literature of the potential association of exposure to polybromo diphenylethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) with neurodevelopmental and/or neurobehavioural effects in infants and children, such as adverse birth outcomes, cognitive deficits, developmental delay and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). However, direct evidence from epidemiology studies has been limited and contradictory. Given the general lack of comparability across studies in terms of design, conduct, methodology and reporting, we developed a checklist-type quality assessment scheme based on the STROBE guidelines and the proposed HONEES criteria, and conducted a systematic review of the epidemiological peer-reviewed literature published since 2006 on neurodevelopmental and/or neurobehavioural effects following prenatal and postnatal exposure to PBDEs and PFCs. We rated 7 of the 18 studies that met our inclusion criteria as being of high quality, 7 of moderate quality and 4 of low quality. Frequently observed shortcomings were the lack of consideration of confounding factors; uncertainties regarding exposure characterization; inadequate sample size; the lack of a clear dose-response; and the representativeness/generalizability of the results. Collectively, the epidemiological evidence does currently not support a strong causal association between PBDEs and PFCs and adverse neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioural outcomes in infants and children. However, despite their limitations, the studies raise questions that require further investigation through hypothesis-driven studies using more harmonized study designs and methodologies, more detailed exposure assessments and repeated testing with larger study populations.

TI Emerging contaminants of public health significance as water quality
   indicator compounds in the urban water cycle
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB The contamination of the urban water cycle (UWC) with a wide array of emerging organic compounds (EOCs) increases with urbanization and population density. To produce drinking water from the UWC requires close examination of their sources, occurrence, pathways, and health effects and the efficacy of wastewater treatment and natural attenuation processes that may occur in surface water bodies and groundwater. This paper researches in details the structure of the UWC and investigates the routes by which the water cycle is increasingly contaminated with compounds generated from various anthropogenic activities. Along with a thorough survey of chemicals representing compound classes such as hormones, antibiotics, surfactants, endocrine disruptors, human and veterinary pharmaceuticals, X-ray contrast media, pesticides and metabolites, disinfection-by-products, algal toxins and taste-and-odor compounds, this paper provides a comprehensive and holistic review of the occurrence, fate, transport and potential health impact of the emerging organic contaminants of the UWC. This study also illustrates the widespread distribution of the emerging organic contaminants in the different aortas of the ecosystem and focuses on future research needs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI The Navigation Guide Systematic Review Methodology: A Rigorous and
   Transparent Method for Translating Environmental Health Science into
   Better Health Outcomes
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB BACKGROUND: Synthesizing what is known about the environmental drivers of health is instrumental to taking prevention-oriented action. Methods of research synthesis commonly used in environmental health lag behind systematic review methods developed in the clinical sciences over the past 20 years.
   OBJECTIVES: We sought to develop a proof of concept of the "Navigation Guide," a systematic and transparent method of research synthesis in environmental health.
   DISCUSSION: The Navigation Guide methodology builds on best practices in research synthesis in evidence-based medicine and environmental health. Key points of departure from current methods of expert-based narrative review prevalent in environmental health include a prespecified protocol, standardized and transparent documentation including expert judgment, a comprehensive search strategy, assessment of "risk of bias," and separation of the science from values and preferences. Key points of departure from evidence-based medicine include assigning a "moderate" quality rating to human observational studies and combining diverse evidence streams.
   CONCLUSIONS: The Navigation Guide methodology is a systematic and rigorous approach to research synthesis that has been developed to reduce bias and maximize transparency in the evaluation of environmental health information. Although novel aspects of the method will require further development and validation, our findings demonstrated that improved methods of research synthesis under development at the National Toxicology Program and under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are fully achievable. The institutionalization of robust methods of systematic and transparent review would provide a concrete mechanism for linking science to timely action to prevent harm.

   Systematic Review of Nonhuman Evidence for PFOA Effects on Fetal Growth
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB BACKGROUND: In contrast to current methods of expert-based narrative review, the Navigation Guide is a systematic and transparent method for synthesizing environmental health research from multiple evidence streams. The Navigation Guide was developed to effectively and efficiently translate the available scientific evidence into timely prevention-oriented action.
   OBJECTIVES: We applied the Navigation Guide systematic review method to answer the question "Does fetal developmental exposure to perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA) or its salts affect fetal growth in animals ?" and to rate the strength of the experimental animal evidence.
   METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature, applied prespecified criteria to the search results to identify relevant studies, extracted data from studies, obtained additional information from study authors, conducted meta-analyses, and rated the overall quality and strength of the evidence.
   RESULTS: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. From the meta-analysis of eight mouse gavage data sets, we estimated that exposure of pregnant mice to increasing concentrations of PFOA was associated with a change in mean pup birth weight of -0.023 g (95% CI: -0.029, -0.016) per 1-unit increase in dose (milligrams per kilogram body weight per day). The evidence, consisting of 15 mammalian and 6 nonmammalian studies, was rated as "moderate" and "low" quality, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: Based on this first application of the Navigation Guide methodology, we found sufficient evidence that fetal developmental exposure to PFOA reduces fetal growth in animals.

TI The Navigation Guide-Evidence-Based Medicine Meets Environmental Health:
   Systematic Review of Human Evidence for PFOA Effects on Fetal Growth
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB BACKGROUND: The Navigation Guide methodology was developed to meet the need for a robust method of systematic and transparent research synthesis in environmental health science. We conducted a case study systematic review to support proof of concept of the method.
   OBJECTIVE: We applied the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology to determine whether developmental exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) affects fetal growth in humans.
   METHODS: We applied the first 3 steps of the Navigation Guide methodology to human epidemiological data: 1) specify the study question, 2) select the evidence, and 3) rate the quality and strength of the evidence. We developed a protocol, conducted a comprehensive search of the literature, and identified relevant studies using prespecified criteria. We evaluated each study for risk of bias and conducted meta-analyses on a subset of studies. We rated quality and strength of the entire body of human evidence.
   RESULTS: We identified 18 human studies that met our inclusion criteria, and 9 of these were combined through meta-analysis. Through meta-analysis, we estimated that a 1-ng/mL increase in serum or plasma PFOA was associated with a -18.9 g (95% CI: -29.8, -7.9) difference in birth weight. We concluded that the risk of bias across studies was low, and we assigned a "moderate" quality rating to the overall body of human evidence.
   CONCLUSION: On the basis of this first application of the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology, we concluded that there is "sufficient" human evidence that developmental exposure to PFOA reduces fetal growth.

   Integration of Animal and Human Evidence for PFOA Effects on Fetal
   Growth
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB BACKGROUND: The Navigation Guide is a novel systematic review method to synthesize scientific evidence and reach strength of evidence conclusions for environmental health decision making.
   OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to integrate scientific findings from human and nonhuman studies to determine the overall strength of evidence for the question "Does developmental exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) affect fetal growth in humans?"
   METHODS: We developed and applied prespecified criteria to systematically and transparently a) rate the quality of the scientific evidence as "high," "moderate," or "low"; b) rate the strength of the human and nonhuman evidence separately as "sufficient," "limited," "moderate," or "evidence of lack of toxicity"; and c) integrate the strength of the human and nonhuman evidence ratings into a strength of the evidence conclusion.
   RESULTS: We identified 18 epidemiology studies and 21 animal toxicology studies relevant to our study question. We rated both the human and nonhuman mammalian evidence as "moderate" quality and "sufficient" strength. Integration of these evidence ratings produced a final strength of evidence rating in which review authors concluded that PFOA is " known to be toxic" to human reproduction and development based on sufficient evidence of decreased fetal growth in both human and nonhuman mammalian species.
   CONCLUSION: We concluded that developmental exposure to PFOA adversely affects human health based on sufficient evidence of decreased fetal growth in both human and nonhuman mammalian species. The results of this case study demonstrate the application of a systematic and transparent methodology, via the Navigation Guide, for reaching strength of evidence conclusions in environmental health.

SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based lipidomics has undergone dramatic developments over the past decade. This review focuses on state of the art in LC-MS-based lipidomics, covering all the steps of global lipidomic profiling.
   By reviewing 185 original papers and application notes, we can conclude that current advanced LC-MS-based lipidomics methods involve:
   (1) lipid extraction schemes using chloroform/MeOH or methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)/MeOH, both with addition of internal standards covering each lipid class;
   (2) LC separation of lipids using short microbore C18 or C8 columns with sub-2-mu m or 2.6-2.8-mu m (fused-core) particle size with analysis time <30 min;
   (3) electrospray ionization in positive- and negative-ion modes with full spectra acquisition using high-resolution MS with capability to MS/MS.
   Phospholipids (phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylglycerols) followed by sphingomyelins, di- and tri-acylglycerols, and ceramides were the most frequently targeted lipid species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Semifluorinated alkanes as a liquid drug carrier system for topical
   ocular drug delivery
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS AND BIOPHARMACEUTICS
AB Semifluorinated alkanes (SFA, e.g. perfluorobutylpentane F4H5, perfluorohexyloctane F6H8) are inert, non-toxic fluids capable of dissolving lipophilic drugs. The aim of this study to assess the bioavailability and safety of SFAs as drug solvents for the topical ocular application of Cyclosporin A (CsA). A commercially available CsA formulation (Restasis (R) 0.05% CsA in castor oil) was tested against two novel formulations of 0.05% CSA in (a) F4H5 containing Ethanol (0.5 w/w%) and (b) F6H8 containing Ethanol (0.5 w/w%) with 0.05% CsA. Formulations were tested on rabbit corneas cultured on an artificial anterior chamber with a constant flow of an aqueous humour supplement (Ex Vivo Eye Irritation Test (EVEIT) system). Anterior chamber fluids were sampled at multiple time points to analyse the CsA concentration following single and repeated application regimes by HPLC. Photographs of fluorescein sodium-stained corneas were recorded for corneal toxicity evaluation. The impact of the formulations on the integrity of the corneal barrier function was tested after drug application by fluorescein sodium corneal diffusion experiments. The influence on the corneal metabolism was evaluated by analysis of the metabolic markers glucose and lactate.
   Restasis (R) did not pass the corneal barrier after short term application, CsA in ethanolic F4H6 reached a maximum of 152.95 ng/ml in anterior chamber fluid samples whilst CsA in ethanolic F6H8 reached a maximum of 15.12 ng/ml. After repeated applications for 8 h, Restasis (R) reached 21.07 ng/ml compared to 247.62 ng/ml and 174.5 ng/ml for F4H5 and F6H8, respectively. No corneal toxicity was observed in following application of any of the formulations.
   In contrast to the commercially available castor oil-based formulation, CsA dissolved in SFAs reached therapeutic inner ocular concentrations after topical administration, possibly leading to the replacement of systemic applications of CsA for inflammatory ocular disease.

TI Pressurized CEC coupled with QTOF-MS for urinary metabolomics
SO ELECTROPHORESIS
AB Pressurized CEC (pCEC) coupled with ESI-QTOF-MS using a sheathless interface was applied for metabolomics to develop an alternative analytical method for metabolic profiling of complex biofluid samples such as urine. The hyphenated system was investigated with mixed standards and pooled urine samples to evaluate its precision, repeatability, linearity, sensitivity, and selectivity. The applied voltage, mobile phase, and gradient elution were optimized and applied for the analysis of urinary metabolites. Multivariate data analysis was subsequently performed and used to distinguish lung cancer patients from healthy controls successfully. High separation efficiency has been achieved in pCEC due to the EOF. For metabolite identification, the pCEC-MS separation mechnism was helpful for discriminating the fragment ions of glutamine conjugates from co-eluted metabolites. Three glutamine conjugates, including phenylacetylglutamine, acylglutamine C8:1, and acylglutamine C6:1 were identified among 16 differential urinary metabolites of lung cancer. Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis of acylglutamine C8:1 resulted in an area-under-curve value of 0.882. Overall, this work suggests that this pCEC-ESI-QTOF-MS method may provide a novel and useful platform for metabolomic studies due to its superior separation and identification.

TI FATE AND EFFECTS OF POLY- AND PERFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES IN THE AQUATIC
   ENVIRONMENT: A REVIEW
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are distributed ubiquitously in the aquatic environment, which raises concern for the flora and fauna in hydrosystems. The present critical review focuses on the fate and adverse effects of PFASs in the aquatic environment. The PFASs are continuously emitted into the environment from point and nonpoint sources such as sewage treatment plants and atmospheric deposition, respectively. Although concentrations of single substances may be too low to cause adverse effects, their mixtures can be of significant environmental concern. The production of C-8-based PFASs (i.e., perfluorooctane sulfonate [PFOS] and perfluorooctanoate [PFOA]) is largely phased out; however, the emissions of other PFASs, in particular short-chain PFASs and PFAS precursors, are increasing. The PFAS precursors can finally degrade to persistent degradation products, which are, in particular, perfluoroalkane sulfonates (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs). In the environment, PFSAs and PFCAs are subject to partitioning processes, whereby short-chain PFSAs and PFCAs are mainly distributed in the water phase, whereas long-chain PFSAs and PFCAs tend to bind to particles and have a substantial bioaccumulation potential. However, there are fundamental knowledge gaps about the interactive toxicity of PFAS precursors and their persistent degradation products but also interactions with other natural and anthropogenic stressors. Moreover, because of the continuous emission of PFASs, further information about their ecotoxicological potential among multiple generations, species interactions, and mixture toxicity seems fundamental to reliably assess the risks for PFASs to affect ecosystem structure and function in the aquatic environment.

TI Fast-track surgery versus traditional perioperative care in laparoscopic
   colorectal cancer surgery: a meta-analysis
SO BMC CANCER
AB Background: Both laparoscopic and fast-track surgery (FTS) have shown some advantages in colorectal surgery. However, the effectiveness of using both methods together is unclear. We performed this meta-analysis to compare the effects of FTS with those of traditional perioperative care in laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery.
   Methods: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Ovid databases for eligible studies until April 2014. The main end points were the duration of the postoperative hospital stay, time to first flatus after surgery, time of first bowel movement, total postoperative complication rate, readmission rate, and mortality.
   Results: Five randomized controlled trials and 5 clinical controlled trials with 1,317 patients were eligible for analysis. The duration of the postoperative hospital stay (weighted mean difference [WMD], -1.64 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.25 to -1.03; p < 0.001), time to first flatus (WMD, -0.40 day; 95% CI, -0.77 to -0.04; p = 0.03), time of first bowel movement (WMD, -0.98 day; 95% CI, -1.45 to -0.52; p < 0.001), and total postoperative complication rate (risk ratio [RR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.56-0.80; p < 0.001) were significantly reduced in the FTS group. No significant differences were noted in the readmission rate (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41-1.01; p = 0.06) or mortality (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 0.42-5.71; p = 0.51).
   Conclusion: Among patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery, FTS is associated with a significantly shorter postoperative hospital stay, more rapid postoperative recovery, and, notably, greater safety than is expected from traditional care.

TI Performance Optimization of Organic Solar Cells
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been gaining great popularity in recent years due to their potentials to be low cost, lightweight, and flexible. The performance of OSCs is growing steadily, and they have achieved a power conversion efficiency close to 10% (for single-junction polymer-fullerene OSC). Although there are still limitations and challenges faced by the development of OSCs, in view of the potentials, recent studies have been focusing on the design optimization of OSC layer structure through material engineering, interfacial layer insertion, layer thickness optimization, and morphological control. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review and detailed discussion on the optimization works and development on OSCs, with particular focus on the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer-fullerene OSCs. We also provide a summary of the performance, in a chronological order, and the future outlook of OSC.

TI QuEChERS sample preparation for the determination of pesticides and
   other organic residues in environmental matrices: a critical review
SO ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) is an extraction and clean-up technique originally developed for recovering pesticide residues from fruits and vegetables. Since its introduction, and until December 2013, about 700 papers have been published using the QuEChERS technique, according to a literature overview carried out using SciFinder, Elsevier SciVerse, and Google search engines. Most of these papers were dedicated to pesticide multiresidue analysis in food matrices, and this topic has been thoroughly reviewed over recent years. The QuEChERS approach is now rapidly developing beyond its original field of application to analytes other than pesticides, and matrices other than food, such as biological fluids and non-edible plants, including Chinese medicinal plants. Recently, the QuEChERS concept has spread to environmental applications by analyzing not only pesticides but also other compounds of environmental concern in soil, sediments, and water. To the best of our knowledge, QuEChERS environmental applications have not been reviewed so far; therefore, in this contribution, after a general discussion on the evolution and changes of the original QuEChERS method, a critical survey of the literature regarding environmental applications of conventional and modified QuEChERS methodology is provided. The overall recoveries obtained with QuEChERS and other extraction approaches (e.g., accelerated solvent extraction, ultrasonic solvent extraction, liquid/solid extraction, and soxhlet extraction) were compared, providing evidence for QuEChERS higher recoveries for various classes of compounds, such as biopesticides, chloroalkanes, phenols, and perfluoroalkyl substances. The role of physicochemical properties of soil (i.e., clay and organic carbon content, as well as cation exchange capacity) and target analytes (i.e., log K-OW, water solubility, and vapor pressure) were also evaluated in order to interpret recovery and matrix effect data.

TI Diagnostic Accuracy of Transesophageal Echocardiogram for the Detection
   of Patent Foramen Ovale: A Meta-Analysis
SO ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY-A JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ULTRASOUND AND ALLIED
   TECHNIQUES
AB Background: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a remnant of the fetal circulation present in 20% of the population. Right-to-left shunting (RLS) through a PFO has been linked to the pathophysiology of stroke, migraine with aura, and hypoxemia. While different imaging modalities including transcranial Doppler, intra-cardiac echo, and transthoracic echo (TTE) have often been used to detect RLS, transesophageal echo (TEE) bubble study remains the gold standard for diagnosing PFO. The aim of this study was to determine the relative accuracy of TEE in the detection of PFO. Methods and Results: A systematic review of Medline, using a standard approach for meta-analysis, was performed for all prospective studies assessing accuracy of TEE in the detection of PFO using confirmation by autopsy, cardiac surgery, and/or catheterization as the reference. Search results revealed 3105 studies; 4 met inclusion criteria. A total of 164 patients were included. TEE had a weighted sensitivity of 89.2% (95% CI: 81.194.7%) and specificity of 91.4% (95% CI: 82.3-96.8%) to detect PFO. The overall positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was 5.93 (95% CI: 1.30-27.09) and the overall negative likelihood ratio (LR-) was 0.22 (95% CI: 0.08-0.56). Conclusion: While TEE bubble study is considered to be the gold standard modality for diagnosing PFO, some PFOs may still be missed or misdiagnosed. It is important to understand the limitations of TEE and perhaps use other highly sensitive screening tests, such as transcranial doppler (TCD), in conjunction with TEE before scheduling a patient for transcatheter PFO closure.

TI Analysis of Trace Metals and Perfluorinated Compounds in 43
   Representative Tea Products from South China
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE
AB Six trace metals (Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Mn) and 2 perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), were analyzed in 43 representative tea products (including 18 green, 12 Oolong, and 13 black teas) from 7 main tea production provinces in China, using the atomic absorption spectrophotometer for trace metals analysis and HPLC-MS/MS for PFOS and PFOA analysis. The average contents of the 3 essential metals Mn, Cu, and Zn ions in the tea samples were 629.74, 17.75, and 37.38 mg/kg, whereas 3 toxic metals Cd, Cr, and Pb were 0.65, 1.02, and 1.92 mg/kg, respectively. The contents of heavy metals in the 3 types of tea were in the order of black tea > Oolong tea > green tea. Both PFOS and PFOA contents were low and PFOA content was higher than PFOS in the tea samples. The highest concentration of PFOA was 0.25 ng/g dry weight found in a Hunan green tea. The Principal component analysis was performed with the trace metals and PFCs to analyze the relationships of these indices. The results showed that black teas had higher trace metals and PFCs than green and Oolong teas, and the teas from Hunan and Zhejiang provinces had higher Pb and Cr than others. Practical Application This paper reports trace metals, and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in wide range of tea products produced in the south China area. This paper also warns the low PFOS and PFOA pollution in tea.

TI Pattern-Based Detection of Toxic Metals in Surface Water with DNA
   Polyfluorophores**
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Heavy metal contamination of water can be toxic to humans and wildlife; thus the development of methods to detect this contamination is of high importance. Here we describe the design and application of DNA-based fluorescent chemosensors on microbeads to differentiate eight toxic metal ions in water. We developed and synthesized four fluorescent 2-deoxyribosides of metal-binding ligands. A tetramer-length oligodeoxy-fluoroside (ODF) library of 6561 members was constructed and screened for sequences responsive to metal ions, of which seven sequences were selected. Statistical analysis of the response patterns showed successful differentiation of the analytes at concentrations as low as 100nM. Sensors were able to classify water samples from 13 varied sites and quantify metal contamination in unknown specimens. The results demonstrate the practical potential of bead-based ODF chemosensors to analyze heavy metal contamination in water samples by a simple and inexpensive optical method.

TI A critical review of perfluorooctanoate and perfluorooctanesulfonate
   exposure and cancer risk in humans
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY
AB Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) are ubiquitous synthetic chemicals with no known effect on human cancer development. This article systematically and critically reviews the epidemiologic evidence regarding the association between PFOA and PFOS exposure and cancer risk in humans. Eighteen epidemiologic studies - eight of PFOA, four of PFOS, and six of both PFOA and PFOS - have estimated associations of exposure to these chemicals with cancer incidence or mortality, with studies equally divided between occupational and nonoccupational settings. Although some statistically significant positive associations have been reported, for example, with cancers of the prostate, kidney, testis, and thyroid, the majority of relative risk estimates for both PFOA and PFOS have been between 0.5 and 2.0 (with 95% confidence intervals including 1.0), inconsistently detected across studies, counterbalanced by negative associations, not indicative of a monotonic exposure-response relationship, and not coherent with toxicological evidence in animals, in which the primary target organs are the liver, testis (Leydig cells), and pancreas (acinar cells). Many positive associations with PFOA exposure were detected in community settings without occupational exposure and were not supported by results in exposed workers. Given that occupational exposure to PFOA and PFOS is one to two orders of magnitude higher than environmental exposure, the discrepant positive findings are likely due to chance, confounding, and/or bias. Taken together, the epidemiologic evidence does not support the hypothesis of a causal association between PFOA or PFOS exposure and cancer in humans.

TI Pollution distribution of heavy metals in surface soil at an informal
   electronic-waste recycling site
SO ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH
AB We studied distribution of heavy metals [lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn)] in surface soil at an electronic-waste (e-waste) recycling workshop near Metro Manila in the Philippines to evaluate the pollution size (spot size, small area or the entire workshop), as well as to assess heavy metal transport into the surrounding soil environment. On-site length-of-stride-scale (similar to 70 cm) measurements were performed at each surface soil point using field-portable X-ray fluorescence (FP-XRF). The surface soil at the e-waste recycling workshop was polluted with Cu, Zn and Pb, which were distributed discretely in surface soil. The site was divided into five areas based on the distance from an entrance gate (y-axis) of the e-waste recycling workshop. The three heavy metals showed similar concentration gradients in the y-axis direction. Zn, Pb and Cu concentrations were estimated to decrease to half of their maximum concentrations at similar to 3, 7 and 7 m from the pollution spot, respectively, inside the informal e-waste recycling workshop. Distance from an entrance may play an important role in heavy metal transport at the soil surface. Using on-site FP-XRF, we evaluated the metal ratio to characterise pollution features of the solid surface. Variability analysis of heavy metals revealed vanishing surficial autocorrelation over metre ranges. Also, the possibility of concentration prediction at unmeasured points using geostatistical kriging was evaluated, and heavy metals had a relative "small" pollution scales and remained inside the original workshop compared with toxic organohalogen compounds. Thus, exposure to heavy metals may directly influence the health of e-waste workers at the original site rather than the surrounding habitat and environmental media.

TI A review on removing pharmaceutical contaminants from wastewater by
   constructed wetlands: Design, performance and mechanism
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state of research activities on the application of constructed wetlands for removing pharmaceutical contaminants from wastewater. The focus of the review was placed on the application of constructed wetlands as an alternative secondary wastewater treatment system or as a wastewater polishing treatment system. The design parameters of the reported constructed wetlands including the physical configuration, hydraulic mode, vegetation species, and targeting pharmaceuticals were summarized. The removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals under different conditions in the wetlands were evaluated at the macroscopic level. In addition, the importance of the three main components of constructed wetlands (substrate, plants and microbes) for pharmaceutical removal was analyzed to elucidate the possible removal mechanisms involved. There is a general consensus among many researchers that constructed wetlands hold great potential of being used as an alternative secondary wastewater treatment system or as a wastewater polishing treatment system for the removal of pharmaceuticals, but relevant reported studies are scarce and are not conclusive in their findings. Current knowledge is limited on the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals in constructed wetlands, the removal mechanisms involved, the toxicity to constructed wetlands caused by pharmaceuticals, and the influences of certain important parameters (configuration design, hydraulic mode, temperature and seasonality, pH, oxygen and redox potential, etc.). This review promotes further research on these issues to provide more and better convincing evidences for the function and performance of larger laboratory-scale, pilot-scale or full-scale constructed wetlands.

AB Global software companies are restructuring their IT area by extending operations to offshore software development centers. Thus, follow-the-sun (FTS) development is seen as a potential software development strategy for these companies. But so far, FTS is relatively understudied (only nine empirical studies published). Moreover, the success cases of FTS usage in the software industry are still small. The lack of studies to close the gap between theory and practice is observed as the main barrier to the FTS evolution. In this study, we present a framework to support research on FTS software development. The proposed framework aims to support empirical studies and meta-analysis on FTS. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we propose an initial framework for researching FTS software development, including independent, dependent and context variables. Additionally, we discuss research challenges, and directions for future research. Our paper aims to provide both a guide and motivation for researchers to better understand how to research FTS and to develop new theories in the area.

TI Differentiating crack cocaine from regular cocaine in whole blood
   samples in drugs and driving cases
SO ANALYTICAL METHODS
AB In this study, the procedure for analyzing cocainic drugs and metabolites (anhydroecgnonine, anhydroecgnonine methyl ester, benzoylecgonine, cocaine, cocaethylene, ecgnonine ethyl ester, and ecgnonine methyl ester) in whole blood samples obtained from drugs and driving cases using a mixed mode solid phase extraction (SPE) C8/SCX cartridge (Clean Screen DAU206), is described. This extraction and analysis procedure allows forensic analysts to differentiate between drivers who have used "crack cocaine" against those using regular cocaine. Samples of whole blood (containing deuterated internal standards) were diluted with an aqueous phosphate buffer (pH 6). Each sample was applied to a conditioned SPE column. The filtrate was collected and adjusted to pH 2. The sorbent was rinsed with deionized (DI) water, aqueous hydrochloric acid and methanol. After drying, cocaine, cocathylene, benzoylecgnonine, and anhydroecgnonine methyl ester were eluted from the SPE column with 3 mL of an elution solvent consisting of methylene chloride-isopropanol-ammonium hydroxide. The original filtrate was applied to a second conditioned SPE column and washed with DI water, aqueous hydrochloric acid and methanol. After drying the SPE sorbent, anhydroecgnonine was eluted with methanol containing 4% ammonium hydroxide (3 mL). The eluates were combined and evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in the mobile phase for analysis by LC-MS/MS in positive multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM). Chromatography was performed in gradient mode employing a C18 column and a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.1% aqueous formic acid. The total run time for each analysis was within five minutes. The limits of quantitation/detection for this method were determined to be 0.5 ng mL(-1) and 1.0 ng mL(-1) respectively. The method was found to be linear from 1.0 ng mL(-1) to 100.0 ng mL(-1) (r(2) > 0.995). The recoveries of the noted cocaine type drugs were found to be greater than 90%. This method was applied to twenty positive cocaine completed drugs and driving cases, it was found that anhydroecgnonine concentrations ranged from 0 ng mL(-1) to 23 ng mL(-1), anhydroecgonine methyl ester concentrations ranged from 0 ng mL(-1) to 66 ng mL(-1), while cocaine was found to range from 25 ng mL(-1) to 250 ng mL(-1), cocaethylene ranged from 0 ng mL(-1) to 80 ng mL(-1), benzoylecgnonine concentrations were found to be in the range 90 ng mL(-1) to 790 ng mL(-1), ecgonine methyl ester concentrations ranged from 40 ng mL(-1) to 500 ng mL(-1) and ecgonine ethyl ester concentrations were found to be in the range 0 ng mL(-1) to 180 ng mL(-1).

TI Understanding short-side-chain perfluorinated sulfonic acid and its
   application for high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The great demand for high-temperature operation of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) has been well answered by short-side-chain perfluorinated sulfonic acid (SSC-PFSA) membranes through a good balance between transport properties and stability. It has been evidenced that fuel cells assembled with SSC-PFSA possess higher and more stable performance at elevated temperature up to 130 degrees C compared to that of fuel cells based on conventional long-side-chain (LSC) PFSA (Nafion (R)) membranes. Moreover, the shorter side-pendent chains and the absence of the ether group and of the tertiary carbon also endow SSC-PFSAs with better durability, making them more suitable for working at harsh conditions in fuel cell systems. This critical review is dedicated to summarizing the properties of SSC-PFSA and providing insight into an understanding of their micro-morphologies, mass diffusion, enhanced proton transportation and their mutual correlation. Diversified measurement techniques applied to investigate the evolution of micro-morphologies, unique diffusion and transportation properties of SSC-PFSAs are reviewed. Despite the higher crystalline and higher water absorption of SSC-PFSAs than those of LSC-PFSAs, the notably less developed and less interconnected ionic clusters in SSC-PFSAs lead to lower mass permeability, and hence the high water uptake is not as well translated into transportation performance as expected. The factors and reasons for the enhanced electrochemical performance of SSC-PFSAs such as higher proton conductivity at elevated temperatures and low humidity conditions are also discussed and understood. Highlights of recent advances in SSC-PFSA-based membranes for fuel cell applications at wider temperature ranges are summarized as general references for researchers to further prompt the development of SSC-PFSAs. The SSC-PFSAs based membranes give a bright future for the next generation of high-temperature PEMFCs.

TI Catalysis engineering of bifunctional solids for the one-step synthesis
   of liquid fuels from syngas: a review
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The combination of acidic zeolites and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalysts for one-step production of liquid fuels from syngas is critically reviewed. Bifunctional systems are classified by the proximity between FTS and acid functionalities on three levels: reactor, catalyst particle, and active phase. A thorough analysis of the published literature on this topic reveals that efficiency in the production of liquid fuels correlates well with the proximity of FTS and acid sites. Moreover, possible side reactions over the FTS metal, including direct CO hydrogenation and hydrocarbon hydrogenolysis, are addressed. The contribution of these side reactions should carefully be considered and separated from that of the zeolite function when evaluating the performance and product spectrum of zeolite-containing catalysts.

TI Intramedullary nails for extracapsular hip fractures in adults
SO COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB Background
   Intramedullary nails may be used for the surgical fixation of extracapsular hip fractures in adults. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005 and last updated in 2008.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different designs of intramedullary nails for treating extracapsular hip fractures in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (6 January 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 12, 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to November Week 3, 2013), MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (3 January 2014), EMBASE (1988 to 2014, Week 1) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (accessed January 2014).
   Selection criteria
   All randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing different types, or design modifications, of intramedullary nails in the treatment of extracapsular hip fractures in adults.
   Data collection and analysis
   At least two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We performed limited meta-analysis using the fixed-effect model.
   Main results
   We included eight new trials, testing seven new comparisons in this update. Overall, we included 17 trials, testing 12 comparisons of different cephalocondylic nail designs. The trials involved a total of 2130 adults (predominantly female and older people) with mainly unstable trochanteric fractures.
   All trials were at unclear risk of bias for most domains, with the majority at high risk of detection bias for subjective outcomes. The three quasi-randomised trials were at high risk for selection bias.
   Four trials (910 participants) compared the proximal femoral nail (PFN) with the Gamma nail. There was no significant difference between the two implants in functional outcome (the very low quality evidence being limited to results from single trials), mortality (low quality evidence: 86/415 versus 80/415; risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.41), serious fixation complications (operative fracture of the femur, cut-out, non-union and later fracture of the femur) nor re-operations (low quality evidence: 45/455 versus 36/455; RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.90).
   Two trials (185 participants) provided very low quality evidence of a lack of clinically significant difference in outcome (functional score, mortality, fracture fixation complications and re-operation) between the ACE trochanteric nail and the Gamma nail.
   Two trials (200 participants) provided very low quality evidence of a lack of significant difference in outcome (mobility score, pain, fracture fixation complications or re-operations) between the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) nail and the Gamma 3 nail.
   Seven of the nine trials evaluating different comparisons provided very low quality evidence of a lack of significant between-group differences in all of the reported main outcomes for the following comparisons: ACE trochanteric nail versus Gamma 3 nail (112 participants); gliding nail versus Gamma nail (80 participants); Russell-Taylor Recon nail versus long Gamma nail (34 participants, all under 50 years); proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) nail versus Targon PF nail (80 participants); dynamically versus statically locked intramedullary hip screw (IMHS) nail (81 participants); sliding versus non-sliding Gamma 3 nail (80 participants, all under 60 years); and long versus standard PFNA nails (40 participants with reverse oblique fractures).
   The other two single comparison trials also provided very low quality evidence of a lack of significant between-group differences in all of the main outcomes with single exceptions. The trial (215 participants) comparing the ENDOVIS nail versus the IMHS nail found low quality evidence of poorer mobility in the ENDOVIS nail group, where more participants in this group were bedridden after their operation (29/105 versus 18/110; RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.85; P = 0.05). The trial (113 participants) comparing the InterTan nail versus the PFNA II nail found very low quality evidence that more PFNA II group participants experienced thigh pain (3/47 versus 12/46; RR: 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.81).
   Authors' conclusions
   The limited evidence from the randomised trials undertaken to date is insufficient to determine whether there are important differences in outcome between different designs of intramedullary nails used in treating extracapsular hip fractures. Given the evidence of superiority of the sliding hip screw compared with intramedullary nails for extracapsular hip fractures, further studies comparing different designs of intramedullary nails are not a priority. Any new design should be evaluated in a randomised comparison with the sliding hip screw.

TI A practical field extraction method for non-invasive monitoring of
   hormone activity in the black rhinoceros
SO CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY
AB Non-invasive hormone analysis is a vital tool in assessing an animal's adrenal and reproductive status, which can be beneficial to in situ and ex situ conservation. However, it can be difficult to employ these techniques when monitoring in situ populations away from controlled laboratory conditions, when electricity is not readily available. A practical method for processing faecal samples in the field, which enables samples to be extracted soon after defaecation and stored in field conditions for prolonged periods prior to hormone analysis, is therefore warranted. This study describes the development of an optimal field extraction method, which includes hand-shaking faecal material in 90% methanol, before loading this extract in a 40% solvent onto HyperSep (TM) C8 solid-phase extraction cartridges, stored at ambient temperatures. This method was successfully validated for measurement of adrenal and reproductive hormone metabolites in faeces of male and female black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) and was rigorously tested in controlled laboratory and simulated field conditions. All the hormones tested demonstrated between 83 and 94% and between 42 and 89% recovery of synthetic and endogenous hormone metabolites, respectively, with high precision of replication. Furthermore, results obtained following the developed optimal field extraction method were highly correlated with the control laboratory method. Cartridges can be stored at ambient (cool, dry or warm, humid) conditions for periods of up to 6 months without degradation, before re-extraction of hormone metabolites for analysis by enzyme immunoassay. The described method has great potential to be applied to monitor faecal reproductive and adrenal hormone metabolites in a wide variety of species and allows samples to be stored in the field for up to 6 months prior to analysis. This provides the opportunity to investigate hormone relationships within in situ populations, where equipment and facilities may previously have been limiting.

TI Critical review of electrochemical advanced oxidation processes for
   water treatment applications
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
AB Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have emerged as novel water treatment technologies for the elimination of a broad-range of organic contaminants. Considerable validation of this technology has been performed at both the bench-scale and pilot-scale, which has been facilitated by the development of stable electrode materials that efficiently generate high yields of hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot) (e.g., boron-doped diamond (BDD), doped-SnO2, PbO2, and substoichiometic-and doped-TiO2). Although a promising new technology, the mechanisms involved in the oxidation of organic compounds during EAOPs and the corresponding environmental impacts of their use have not been fully addressed. In order to unify the state of knowledge, identify research gaps, and stimulate new research in these areas, this review critically analyses published research pertaining to EAOPs. Specific topics covered in this review include (1) EAOP electrode types, (2) oxidation pathways of select classes of contaminants, (3) rate limitations in applied settings, and (4) long-term sustainability. Key challenges facing EAOP technologies are related to toxic byproduct formation (e.g., ClO4- and halogenated organic compounds) and low electro-active surface areas. These challenges must be addressed in future research in order for EAOPs to realize their full potential for water treatment.

TI 2013 Atomic spectrometry update-A review of advances in environmental
   analysis
SO JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY
AB This is the 29th annual review of the application of atomic spectrometry to the chemical analysis of environmental samples. This Update refers to papers published approximately between September 2012 and July 2013 and continues the series of Atomic Spectrometry Updates (ASUs) in Environmental Analysis(1) that should be read in conjunction with other related ASUs in the series namely: clinical and biological materials, foods and beverages;(2) advances in atomic spectrometry and related techniques;(3) elemental speciation;(3) X-ray spectrometry(4) and advances in the analysis of metals, chemicals and materials.(3) In the field of air analysis, highlights within this review period include measuring the bioaccessible fraction of metals in particles and ongoing work in assessing the performance of optical and combustion techniques for the determination of the carbonaceous content of airborne particulate matter. Developments in instrumentation included new sampler designs for the collection of nanoparticles, the coupling of FFF and hydrodynamic chromatography to ICP-MS for the sizing and compositional analysis of such particles and the ongoing development of aerosol mass spectrometry. In the field of water analysis, new procedures for the detection and quantification of emerging pollutants in water such as MRI contrast agents have been developed. Instrumental developments reported include the use of molecular absorption spectrometry, by exploiting the CS-MS technique, for measuring halogen species in water. Numerous articles involving the application of atomic spectrometry to plants, soils and related materials appeared in this review period but, as usual, most were concerned with the environmental significance of the results, rather than the methodology used to obtain them. Nevertheless, there have been some interesting developments. Both LIBS and PXRF spectrometry have been used more widely, variants such as LA-LIBS and microwave assisted LIBS have appeared, and PXRF spectrometry has been applied for the first time in the analysis of plants. Developments in geochemical analysis include the production and (re)certification of new geological RMs for bulk, isotopic and microspatial analysis. Optimisation of LA-ICP-MS techniques for the interrogation of geochemical samples continues to be reported and a number of useful instrumental review articles (AMS, ICP-MS and SIMS) have been published. Feedback on this review is most welcome and the review coordinator can be contacted using the email address provided.

TI Water Fluoridation: A Critical Review of the Physiological Effects of
   Ingested Fluoride as a Public Health Intervention
SO SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL
AB Fluorine is the world's 13th most abundant element and constitutes 0.08% of the Earth crust. It has the highest electronegativity of all elements. Fluoride is widely distributed in the environment, occurring in the air, soils, rocks, and water. Although fluoride is used industrially in a fluorine compound, the manufacture of ceramics, pesticides, aerosol propellants, refrigerants, glassware, and Teflon cookware, it is a generally unwanted byproduct of aluminium, fertilizer, and iron ore manufacture. The medicinal use of fluorides for the prevention of dental caries began in January 1945 when community water supplies in Grand Rapids, United States, were fluoridated to a level of 1 ppm as a dental caries prevention measure. However, water fluoridation remains a controversial public health measure. This paper reviews the human health effects of fluoride. The authors conclude that available evidence suggests that fluoride has a potential to cause major adverse human health problems, while having only a modest dental caries prevention effect. As part of efforts to reduce hazardous fluoride ingestion, the practice of artificial water fluoridation should be reconsidered globally, while industrial safety measures need to be tightened in order to reduce unethical discharge of fluoride compounds into the environment. Public health approaches for global dental caries reduction that do not involve systemic ingestion of fluoride are urgently needed.

TI The metabolic signature associated with the Western dietary pattern: a
   cross-sectional study
SO NUTRITION JOURNAL
AB Background: Metabolic profiles have been shown to be associated to obesity status and insulin sensitivity. Dietary intakes influence metabolic pathways and therefore, different dietary patterns may relate to modifications in metabolic signatures. The objective was to verify associations between dietary patterns and metabolic profiles composed of amino acids (AAs) and acylcarnitines (ACs).
   Methods: 210 participants were recruited in the greater Quebec City area between September 2009 and December 2011. Dietary patterns had been previously derived using principal component analysis (PCA). The Prudent dietary pattern was characterised by higher intakes of vegetables, fruits, whole grain products, non-hydrogenated fat and lower intakes of refined grain products, whereas the Western dietary pattern was associated with higher intakes of refined grain products, desserts, sweets and processed meats. Targeted metabolites were quantified in 37 participants with the Biocrates Absolute IDQ p150 (Biocrates Life Sciences AG, Austria) mass spectrometry method (including 14 amino acids and 41 acylcarnitines).
   Results: PCA analysis with metabolites including AAs and ACs revealed two main components explaining the most variance in overall data (13.8%). PC1 was composed mostly of medium-to long-chain ACs (C16:2, C14:2, C14:2-OH, C16, C14:1-OH, C14: 1, C10:2, C5-DC/C6-OH, C12, C18:2, C10, C4:1-DC/C6, C8:1 and C2) whereas PC2 included certain AAs and short-chain ACs (xLeu, Met, Arg, Phe, Pro, Orn, His, C0, C3, C4 and C5). The Western dietary pattern correlated negatively with PC1 and positively with PC2 (r = -0.34, p = 0.05 and r = 0.38, p = 0.03, respectively), independently of age, sex and BMI.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that the Western dietary pattern is associated with a specific metabolite signature characterized by increased levels of AAs including branched-chain AAs (BCAAs) and short-chain ACs.

TI Direct quantitative analysis of benzodiazepines, metabolites, and
   analogs in diluted human urine by rapid resolution liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD AND DRUG ANALYSIS
AB Rapid resolution liquid chromatography (RRLC) coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (QqQ-MS) was developed for direct quantitative analysis of benzodiazepines (BDZs) and their metabolites, as well as BDZ analogs (zopiclone, zolpidem, and zaleplon) in diluted human urine. A perfluorophenyl column packed with sub-2-mu m particles and a C8 precolumn were applied to accomplish RRLC analysis with symmetric peak shapes. Urine samples were diluted 10-fold with Milli-Q water prior to autoinjection for direct quantification of 34 target analytes with negligible matrix effect. Gradient elution and dynamic multiple reaction monitoring were used for simultaneous quantitation of 34 BDZs, metabolites, and BDZ analogs. Good recovery was obtained in the range of 80.2-98.5% and the limit of detection ranged from 0.01 ng/mL to 0.5 ng/mL for all 34 target analytes in spiked urine. Moreover, good precision and accuracy were obtained for quantitative determination in diluted urine samples by the proposed RRLC/QqQ-MS method for intra-day/inter-day assays in the ranges of 0.1-8.8%/0.1-8.9% and 91.2-106.1%/89.6-104.6%, respectively. The applicability of this newly developed RRLC/QqQ-MS method was demonstrated by quantitative determination of BDZs, metabolites, and BDZ analogs in various clinical urine samples.

TI Do the divisome and elongasome share a common evolutionary past?
SO CURRENT OPINION IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB The divisome and elongasome are bacterial protein complexes responsible for peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis during cell division and elongation, respectively. We review several lines of evidence, arguing for a shared evolutionary past of the divisome and elongasome. Both integrate closely related penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) for PG synthesis, use proteins of the RodA/FtsW (SEDS, shape, elongation, division and sporulation) family for Lipid II export and interact with MraY/Mur proteins for Lipid II synthesis. It was recently shown that the actin-like protein FtsA of the divisome polymerises on membranes, adding another parallel, since membrane-associated filaments of the bacterial actin MreB guide the elongasome. Given these similarities, it seems plausible to conclude that the elongasome is a modified version of the divisome, without the membrane-constricting FtsZ-ring and its associated machinery on the inside.

TI An integrated metabonomics and transcriptomics approach to understanding
   metabolic pathway disturbance induced by perfluorooctanoic acid
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS
AB Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is one of the most representative perfluorinated compounds and liver is the major organ where PFOA is accumulated. Although the multiple toxicities had been reported, its toxicological profile remained unclear. In this study, a systems toxicology strategy integrating liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based metabonomics and transcriptomics analyses was applied for the first time to investigate the effects of PFOA on a representative Chinese normal human liver cell line L-02, with focusing on the metabolic disturbance. Fifteen potential biomarkers were identified on metabolic level and most observations were consistent with the altered levels of gene expression. Our results showed that PFOA induced the perturbations in various metabolic processes in L-02 cells, especially lipid metabolism-related pathways. The up-stream mitochondrial carnitine metabolism was proved to be influenced by PFOA treatment. The specific transformation from carnitine to acylcarnitines, which showed a dose-dependent effect, and the expression level of key genes involved in this pathway were observed to be altered correspondingly. Furthermore, the down-stream cholesterol biosynthesis was directly confirmed to be up-regulated by both increased cholesterol content and elevated expression level of key genes. The PFOA-induced lipid metabolism-related effects in L-02 cells started from the fatty acid catabolism in cytosol, fluctuated to the processes in mitochondria, extended to the cholesterol biosynthesis. Many other metabolic pathways like amino acid metabolism and tricarboxylic acid cycle might also be disturbed. The findings obtained from the systems biological research provide more details about metabolic disorders induced by PFOA in human liver. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Recent advances in transition metal-catalyzed Csp(2)-monofluoro-,
   difluoro-, perfluoromethylation and trifluoromethylthiolation
SO BEILSTEIN JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB In the last few years, transition metal-mediated reactions have joined the toolbox of chemists working in the field of fluorination for Life-Science oriented research. The successful execution of transition metal-catalyzed carbon-fluorine bond formation has become a landmark achievement in fluorine chemistry. This rapidly growing research field has been the subject of some excellent reviews. Our approach focuses exclusively on transition metal-catalyzed reactions that allow the introduction of -CFH2, -CF2H, -CnF2n+1 and -SCF3 groups onto sp(2) carbon atoms. Transformations are discussed according to the reaction-type and the metal employed. The review will not extend to conventional non-transition metal methods to these fluorinated groups.

SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF NON-FERROUS METALS
AB This study is devoted to the fabrication technology of composite materials with specified properties prepared from iron-based powder materials. A procedure of the ultrasonic impregnation of the samples with infiltrative compositions at various concentrations, temperatures, and time is described. The characteristics of oil absorbability are given. The physicomechanical properties of impregnated samples compared with the samples fabricated using the traditional method are investigated. The fabricated materials have a decreased friction coefficient (by a factor of similar to 1.25) and improved leak-tightness (the samples withstood a pressure of 25 atm for 1 min). Metallographic analysis shows pores of sintered samples being filled with impregnating suspensions. The efficiency of this technology for achieving the specified operational properties of the wares is substantiated.

TI Fluorinated dendrimers as imaging agents for F-19 MRI
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-NANOMEDICINE AND NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY
AB F-19 is the second most sensitive stable nucleus for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Because there is no endogenous F-19 signal, F-19 MRI is much more suited for quantification and tracking than H-1 MRI. However, F-19 MRI is not in clinical use because in spite of more than three decades of research, there are no approved F-19 imaging agents. New approaches and new methodologies are needed to move the field forward. Water-soluble fluorinated dendrimers present a promising alternative to conventional perfluorocarbon emulsions. This article outlines recent development of fluorinated dendrimers as F-19 imaging agents. This is notmeant to be a comprehensive review of F-19 imaging agents, for which there is an excellent recent review by Knight et al. Rather, the article aims to give an insider's account on research efforts in this exciting and challenging field. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Review and prospect of emerging contaminants in waste - Key issues and
   challenges linked to their presence in waste treatment schemes: General
   aspects and focus on nanoparticles
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The presence in waste of emerging pollutants (EPs), whose behaviours and effects are not well understood, may present unexpected health and environmental risks and risks for the treatment processes themselves. EP may include substances that are newly detected in the environment, substances already identified as risky and whose use in items is prohibited (but which may be present in old or imported product waste) or substances already known but whose recent use in products can cause problems during their future treatment as waste. Several scientific studies have been conducted to assess the presence of EP in waste, but they are mostly dedicated to a single category of substance or one particular waste treatment. In the absence of a comprehensive review focused on the impact of the presence of EP on waste treatment schemes, the authors present a review of the key issues associated with the treatment of waste containing emerging pollutants. This review presents the typologies of emerging pollutants that are potentially present in waste along with the major challenges for each treatment scheme (recycling, composting, digestion, incineration, landfilling and wastewater treatment). All conventional treatment processes are affected by these new pollutants, and they were almost never originally designed to consider these substances. In addition to these general aspects, a comprehensive review of available data, projects and future R&D needs related to the impact of nanoparticles on waste treatment is presented as a case study.

TI Meta-analysis of toxicity and teratogenicity of 133 chemicals from
   zebrafish developmental toxicity studies
SO REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY
AB Zebrafish developmental toxicity testing is an emerging field, which faces considerable challenges regarding data meta-analysis and the establishment of standardized test protocols. Here, we present an initial correlation study on toxicity of 133 chemicals based on data in the literature to ascertain predictive developmental toxicity endpoints. We found that the physical properties of chemicals (BCF or log P) did not fully predict lethality or developmental outcomes. Instead, individual outcomes such as pericardial edema and yolk sac edema were more reliable indicators of developmental toxicity. In addition, we ranked the chemicals based on toxicity with the Toxicological Priority Index (ToxPi) program and via a teratogenic ratio, and found that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) had the highest ToxPi score, triphenyltin acetate had the highest average ToxPi score (corrected for missing data and having more than 4 outcomes), and N-methyl-dithiocarbamate had the highest teratogenic ratio.

TI Vanadium Bisimide Bonding Investigated by X-ray Crystallography, V-51
   and C-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, and V L-3,L-2-Edge
   X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure Spectroscopy
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Syntheses of neutral halide and aryl vanadium bisimides are described. Treatment of VCl2(NtBu)[NTMS-((NBu)-Bu-t)], 2, with PMe3, PEt3, PMe2Ph, or pyridine gave vanadium bisimides via TMSC1 elimination in good yield: VCl(PMe3)(2)((NBu)-Bu-t)(2) 3, VCl(PEt3)(2)(NlBu)(2) 4, VCl(PMe2Ph)(2)((NBu)-Bu-t)(2) 5, and VCl(Py)(2)((NBu)-Bu-t)(2) 6. The halide series (Cl-I) was synthesized by use of TMSBr and TMSI to give VBr(PMe3)(2)((NBu)-Bu-t)(2) 7 and VI(PMe3)(2)((NBu)-Bu-t)(2) 8. The phenyl derivative was obtained by reaction of 3 with MgPh2 to give VPh(PMe3)(2)((NBu)-Bu-t)(2) 9. These neutral complexes are compared to the previously reported cationic bisimides [V(PMe3)(3)((NBu)-Bu-t)(2)][Al(PFTB)(4)] 10, [V(PEt3)(2)((NBu)-Bu-t)(2)][Al(PFTB)(4)] 11, and [V(DMAP)(PEt3)(2)((NBu)-Bu-t)(2)][Al(PFTB)(4)] 12 (DMAP = dimethylaminopyridine, PFTB = perfluoro-tert-butoxide). Characterization of the complexes by X-ray diffraction, C-13 NMR, V-51 NMR, and V L-3,L-2-edge X-ray absorption nearedge structure (XANES) spectroscopy provides a description of the electronic structure in comparison to group 6 bisimides and the bent metallocene analogues. The electronic structure is dominated by pi bonding to the imides, and localization of electron density at the nitrogen atoms of the imides is dictated by the cone angle and donating ability of the axial neutral supporting ligands. This phenomenon is clearly seen in the sensitivity of V-51 NMR shift, C-13 NMR Delta delta(alpha beta), and L-3-edge energy to the nature of the supporting phosphine ligand, which defines the parameters for designing cationic group 5 bisimides that would be capable of breaking stronger sigma bonds. Conversely, all three methods show little dependence on the variable equatorial halide ligand. Furthermore, this analysis allows for quantification of the electronic differences between vanadium bisimides and the structurally analogous mixed Cp/imide system CpV((NBu)-Bu-t)X-2 (Cp = C5H51-).

TI Illicit drugs and the environment - A review
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Illicit drugs and their metabolites are the latest group of emerging pollutants. Determination of their concentration in environment (such as water bodies, soil, sediment, air) is an indirect tool to estimate the community level consumption of illicit drug and to evaluate potential ecotoxicological impacts from chronic low level exposure. They enter the wastewater network as unaltered drugs and/or their active metabolites by human excretion after illegal consumption or by accidental or deliberate disposal from clandestine drug laboratories. This article critically reviews the occurrence and concentration levels of illicit drugs and their metabolites in different environmental compartments (e.g., wastewater, surface waters, groundwater, drinking water, and ambient air) and their potential impact on the ecosystem. There is limited published information available on the presence of illicit drugs in the environment, reports are available mainly from European countries, UK, USA, and Canada but there is a lack of information from the remainder of the world. Although the environmental concentrations are not very high, they can potentially impact the human health and ecosystem functioning. Cocaine, morphine, amphetamine, and MDMA have potent pharmacological activities and their presence as complex mixtures in water may cause adverse effect on aquatic organisms and human health. However, there is no current regulation demanding the determination of occurrence of these emerging pollutants in treated wastewater, surface water, drinking water, or atmosphere. Thus, critical investigation on distribution pattern of this new group of emerging contaminant and their potential harmful impact on our environment needs immediate attention.

TI Enantioselective separation of amino acids as biomarkers indicating life
   in extraterrestrial environments
SO ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Traces of prebiotic amino acids, i.e., the building blocks of proteins, are excellent biomarkers that could provide evidence of extinct or extant life in extra-terrestrial environments. In particular, characterization of the enantiomeric excess of amino acids gives relevant information about the biotic or abiotic origin of molecules, because it is generally assumed that life elsewhere could be based on either l or d amino acids, but not both. The analytical procedures used in in-situ space missions for chiral discrimination of amino acids must meet severe requirements imposed by flight conditions: short analysis time, low energy consumption, robustness, storage for long periods under extreme conditions, high efficiency and sensitivity, automation, and remote-control operation. Such methods are based on gas chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography, and capillary electrophoresis, usually coupled with mass spectrometry; of these, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is the only such combination yet used in space missions. Preliminary in-situ sample derivatization is required before GC-MS analysis to convert amino acids into volatile and thermally stable compounds. The silylation reagent most commonly used, N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide, is unsuitable for detection of homochirality, and alternative derivatization techniques have been developed that preserve the stereochemical configuration of the original compounds and are compatible with spaceflight conditions. These include the reagent N,N-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal, which has already been used in the Rosetta mission, a mixture of alkyl chloroformate, ethanol, and pyridine, a mixture of perfluorinated anhydrides and perfluoro alcohols, and hexafluoroacetone, the first gaseous derivatizing agent. In all the space instruments, solvent extraction of organic matter and chemical derivatization have been combined in a single automatic and remote-controlled procedure in a chemical reactor. Liquid-based separation systems have been used in space missions. In particular, microchip capillary electrophoresis, based on microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems, enables high-performance chemical analysis of amino acids with low mass and volume equipment and low power and reagent consumption. Coupling with laser-induced fluorescence detectors results in ultra-low limits of detection. This critical review describes applications of the on-board instruments used in the Rosetta mission to comets and in the more recent Mars exploration program, i.e., the Mars Science Laboratory and ExoMars missions.

TI Solution by dilution?-A review on the pollution status of the Yangtze
   River
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The Yangtze River has been a source of life and prosperity for the Chinese people for centuries and is a habitat for a remarkable variety of aquatic species. But the river suffers from huge amounts of urban sewage, agricultural effluents, and industrial wastewater as well as ship navigation wastes along its course. With respect to the vast amounts of water and sediments discharged by the Yangtze River, it is reasonable to ask whether the pollution problem may be solved by simple dilution. This article reviews the past two decades of published research on organic pollutants in the Yangtze River and several adjacent water bodies connected to the main stream, according to a holistic approach. Organic pollutant levels and potential effects of water and sediments on wildlife and humans, measured in vitro, in vivo, and in situ, were critically reviewed. The contamination with organic pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and others, of water and sediment along the river was described. Especially Wuhan section and the Yangtze Estuary exhibited stronger pollution than other sections. Bioassays, displaying predominantly the endpoints mutagenicity and endocrine disruption, applied at sediments, drinking water, and surface water indicated a potential health risk in several areas. Aquatic organisms exhibited detectable concentrations of toxic compounds like PCBs, OCPs, PBDEs, and PFCs. Genotoxic effects could also be assessed in situ in fish. To summarize, it can be stated that dilution reduces the ecotoxicological risk in the Yangtze River, but does not eliminate it. Keeping in mind an approximately 14 times greater water discharge compared to the major European river Rhine, the absolute pollution mass transfer of the Yangtze River is of severe concern for the environmental quality of its estuary and the East China Sea. Based on the review, further research needs have been identified.

TI A computational approach to chemical etiologies of diabetes
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Computational meta-analysis can link environmental chemicals to genes and proteins involved in human diseases, thereby elucidating possible etiologies and pathogeneses of non-communicable diseases. We used an integrated computational systems biology approach to examine possible pathogenetic linkages in type 2 diabetes (T2D) through genome-wide associations, disease similarities, and published empirical evidence. Ten environmental chemicals were found to be potentially linked to T2D, the highest scores were observed for arsenic, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, hexachlorobenzene, and perfluorooctanoic acid. For these substances we integrated disease and pathway annotations on top of protein interactions to reveal possible pathogenetic pathways that deserve empirical testing. The approach is general and can address other public health concerns in addition to identifying diabetogenic chemicals, and offers thus promising guidance for future research in regard to the etiology and pathogenesis of complex diseases.

TI Food traceability as an integral part of logistics management in food
   and agricultural supply chain
SO FOOD CONTROL
AB The contemporary food supply chain (FSC) should adequately provide information that consumers and other concerned bodies need to know such as variety of the food attributes, country of origin, animal welfare, and genetic engineering related issues. For this, effective food traceability system (FTS) is important. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive literature review on food traceability issues. About 74 studies, mainly focusing on food traceability issues and published during 2000-2013, were reviewed. Based on the review results, the definition, driving forces, barriers in developing and implementing FTSs, benefits, traceability technologies, improvements, and performances of FTSs have been identified and discussed. Considering FTS as an integral part of logistics management, new conceptual definition of FTS has been provided. This review has pointed out that the issue of developing effective and full chain FTS is quite complex in nature as it requires a deeper understanding of real processes from different perspectives such as economic, legal, technological, and social issues. Therefore, future researches (recommended here) on traceability should focus on: integration of traceability activities with food logistics activities; technological aspects of FTSs; the linkage between traceability system and food production units; standardization of data capturing and information exchange; awareness creation strategies; continuity of information flow and effective communication of traceability information to consumers and other stakeholders; the linkage between different drivers of FTS; improvement strategies of FTS; and development of performance evaluation frameworks for FTSs.

AB In this paper, CNFs prepared at three different temperatures (1023, 873 and 723 K, called CNF-1, CNF-2 and CNF-3, respectively) were used as supports for cobalt-based catalysts in the Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS). The supports and cobalt catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques; the metal content of the cobalt-based catalysts was analyzed by atomic absorption. The activity and selectivity of the CNFs supported catalysts were studied at 523 K, 20 bar and H-2/CO = 2. Co/CNF-1 and Co/CNF-2 were very active and showed high selectivity to CH4 and CO2, without further deactivation, whereas the less active catalyst Co/CNF-3 led to the highest selectivity to long-chained hydrocarbons (C5+) and under was a remarkable deactivation. Used catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption, XRD and TGA. Results confirmed that all the catalysts underwent catalyst fouling as a consequence of C5+ hydrocarbons formation whereas catalyst Co/CNF-3 presented a notably metal sintering by coalescence.

TI H-1 NMR-Based Metabolomic Analysis of Sub-Lethal Perfluorooctane
   Sulfonate Exposure to the Earthworm, Eisenia fetida, in Soil
SO METABOLITES
AB H-1 NMR-based metabolomics was used to measure the response of Eisenia fetida earthworms after exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in soil. Earthworms were exposed to a range of PFOS concentrations (five, 10, 25, 50, 100 or 150 mg/kg) for two, seven and fourteen days. Earthworm tissues were extracted and analyzed by H-1 NMR. Multivariate statistical analysis of the metabolic response of E. fetida to PFOS exposure identified time-dependent responses that were comprised of two separate modes of action: a non-polar narcosis type mechanism after two days of exposure and increased fatty acid oxidation after seven and fourteen days of exposure. Univariate statistical analysis revealed that 2-hexyl-5-ethyl-3-furansulfonate (HEFS), betaine, leucine, arginine, glutamate, maltose and ATP are potential indicators of PFOS exposure, as the concentrations of these metabolites fluctuated significantly. Overall, NMR-based metabolomic analysis suggests elevated fatty acid oxidation, disruption in energy metabolism and biological membrane structure and a possible interruption of ATP synthesis. These conclusions obtained from analysis of the metabolic profile in response to sub-lethal PFOS exposure indicates that NMR-based metabolomics is an excellent discovery tool when the mode of action (MOA) of contaminants is not clearly defined.

TI A new turn-off fluorescent chemosensor for iron (III) based on new
   diphenylfluorenes with phosphonic acid
SO JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE
AB Novel phosphonic acid-functionalized fluorene derivatives 9, 9-bis (3'-phosphonic acid propyl)-2, 7-diphenylfluorene and 2,7-diphenylfluorene-9-ylphosphonic acid, synthesized by Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction, were evaluated as a chemoselective Fe3+ ion sensor. Through the disappearance of the characteristic sorption peak of P=O, P-OH and the form of new broad band (P-OFe stretching bands) in FT-IR spectra, it was verified that the Fe3+ ion cause the quenching of their fluorescence emission, due to the Fe3+ ion binding to them via the O-atoms of the phosphonic group. UV-vis analyses also gave evidences by the change of absorption peak of them. A linear relationship that flowed with the Perrin model of static quenching was observed between the relative fluorescence intensity (In F-0/F) of BPPDPF and the concentration of iron(III) in the range of 1-8 mu M with a detection limit of 0.02 mu M, so was with DPFPA in the range of 1-5 mu M with a detection limit of 0.01 mu M. Selectivity of them for Fe3+ was demonstrated over other metal ions by photoluminescence analysis in DMF-H2O solution. It showed that the other studied metal ions do not affect the determination of iron. We successfully monitored trace levels of iron (III) in tap water samples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI A systematic review and meta-analysis of the safety profile of
   fast-track surgery for colorectal surgery
SO CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety profile of fast-track surgery (FTS) compared to standard care in elective colorectal surgery involving segmental colonic and/or rectal resection.
   All of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on FTS for colorectal surgery were analyzed with the Cochrane systematic review. Database retrievals of Medline, Embase and Cochrane was were conducted, together with two published FTS meta-analyses. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the studies, extracted the relevant data and performed a cross-check. A metaanalysis was performed with RevMan 5 software.
   A total of 15 studies were reviewed in this study, including 13 articles in English and 2 articles in Chinese, of which 7 were RCTs and 8 were CCTs. The overall rates of morbidity and readmission in the FTS group were lower compared to patients who underwent the conventional treatments (conventional treatment group or control group) in the RCTs but tended to increase in the CCTs. There were no statistically significant differences between the FTS group and the control group regarding ileus, anastomotic leakage, abdominal distention, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention and infection of the incisional wound.
   The overall rates of morbidity and readmission in the FTS group were similar or even lower compared to the control group in RCTs, with an increasing trend in the CCTs. Further discussion is needed as to why the results of the RCTs were not repeated in the CCTs, especially with regard to the causes of readmission. It should also be determined whether an early discharge might cause a delay in the diagnosis of some complications, and thereby the occurrence of serious complications. If a number of severe complications occurred due to an early discharge, the value of FTS would be in question. (C) Versita Sp. z o.o

TI Evaluation of the Association between Persistent Organic Pollutants
   (POPs) and Diabetes in Epidemiological Studies: A National Toxicology
   Program Workshop Review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a major threat to public health in the United States and worldwide. Understanding the role of environmental chemicals in the development or progression of diabetes is an emerging issue in environmental health.
   OBJECTIVE: We assessed the epidemiologic literature for evidence of associations between persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and type 2 diabetes.
   METHODS: Using a PubMed search and reference lists from relevant studies or review articles, we identified 72 epidemiological studies that investigated associations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) with diabetes. We evaluated these studies for consistency, strengths and weaknesses of study design (including power and statistical methods), clinical diagnosis, exposure assessment, study population characteristics, and identification of data gaps and areas for future research.
   CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity of the studies precluded conducting a meta-analysis, but the overall evidence is sufficient for a positive association of some organochlorine POPs with type 2 diabetes. Collectively, these data are not sufficient to establish causality. Initial data mining revealed that the strongest positive correlation of diabetes with POPs occurred with organochlorine compounds, such as trans-nonachlor, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dioxins and dioxin-like chemicals. There is less indication of an association between other nonorganochlorine POPs, such as perfluoroalkyl acids and brominated compounds, and type 2 diabetes. Experimental data are needed to confirm the causality of these POPs, which will shed new light on the pathogenesis of diabetes. This new information should be considered by governmental bodies involved in the regulation of environmental contaminants.

TI Antirotation proximal femoral nail versus dynamic hip screw for
   intertrochanteric fractures: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled
   studies
SO ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH
AB Background: Previous studies comparing proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) with dynamic hip screw (DHS) for peritrochanteric fractures reported conflicting findings. The objective of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of PFNA and DHS for pertrochanteric fractures.
   Hypothesis: PFNA achieves better efficacy for peritrochanteric fractures compared with DHS.
   Materials and methods: Relevant randomized controlled trials comparing PFNA with DHS for pertrochanteric fractures were assessed for eligibility and included into this meta-analysis. Data were extracted independently and methodological quality was further assessed. The inclusion criteria of this meta-analysis were: randomized controlled trials comparing PFNA with DHS for pertrochanteric fractures and reporting at least one of these main outcomes, including operating time, blood loss, all causes mortality, and complications.
   Results: Five randomized controlled trials were finally included into this meta-analysis. Pooled results showed there were less blood loss (weighted mean difference Blood loss = -249.75 ml, 95% CI -303.83 to -195.67, P < 0.0001) and fewer complications (Odds ratio = 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.70, P = 0.001) in the PFNA group compared with the DHS group. However, there was no difference in term of mortality between those two groups (Odds ratio mortality = 1.13, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.69, P = 0.79). Sensitivity analysis by sequential omission of individual studies showed that the significance of pooled odds ratios was robust, which suggested this outcome was credible.
   Discussion: PFNA can benefit peritrochanteric fractures patients with less blood loss and fewer complications compared with DHS. The significant heterogeneity among the included trials for intraoperative blood loss, and operation time may be attributable to variation in the skills of the surgeons and the different types of perirochanteric fractures. In addition, more powered randomized studies are needed to identify the findings from this meta-analysis, and the effects of long-term follow-up also need further study, especially the impact on the mortality.

TI Production and Release of Acylcarnitines by Primary Myotubes Reflect the
   Differences in Fasting Fat Oxidation of the Donors
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB Context: Acylcarnitines are biomarkers of incomplete beta-oxidation and mitochondrial lipid overload but indicate also high rates of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. It is unknown whether the production of acylcarnitines in primary human myotubes obtained from lean, metabolically healthy subjects reflects the fat oxidation in vivo.
   Objective: Our objective was to quantify the acylcarnitine production in myotubes obtained from subjects with low and high fasting respiratory quotient (RQ).
   Methods: Fasting RQ was determined by indirect calorimetry. Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were taken from 6 subjects with low fasting RQ (mean 0.79 +/- 0.03) and 6 with high fasting RQ (0.90 +/- 0.03), and satellite cells were isolated, cultured, and differentiated to myotubes. Myotubes were cultivated with 125 mu(MC)-C-13-labeled palmitate for 30 minutes and 4 and 24 hours. Quantitative profiling of 42 intracellular and 31 extracellular acylcarnitines was performed by stable isotope dilution-based metabolomics analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.
   Results: Myotubes from donors with high fasting RQ produced and released significant higher amounts of medium-chain acylcarnitines. High (13)C8 and (13)C10 acylcarnitine levels in the extracellular compartment correlated with high fasting RQ. The decreased expression of medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) in these myotubes can explain the higher rate of incomplete fatty acid oxidation. A lower intracellular [C-13] acetylcarnitine to carnitine and lower intracellular (13)C16/(13)C18 acylcarnitine to carnitine ratio indicate reduced fatty acid oxidation capacity in these myotubes. Mitochondrial DNA content was not different.
   Conclusion: Acylcarnitine production and release from primary human myotubes of donors with high fasting RQ indicate a reduced fatty acid oxidation capacity and a higher rate of incomplete fatty acid oxidation. Thus, quantitative profiling of acylcarnitine production in human myotubes can be a suitable tool to identify muscular determinants of fat oxidation in vivo.

TI High Fat Diet Feeding Exaggerates Perfluorooctanoic Acid-Induced Liver
   Injury in Mice via Modulating Multiple Metabolic Pathways
SO PLOS ONE
AB High fat diet (HFD) is closely linked to a variety of health issues including fatty liver. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a synthetic perfluorinated carboxylic acid, also causes liver injury. The present study investigated the possible interactions between high fat diet and PFOA in induction of liver injury. Mice were pair-fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or low fat control with or without PFOA administration at 5 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks. Exposure to PFOA alone caused elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and increased liver weight along with reduced body weight and adipose tissue mass. HFD alone did not cause liver damage, but exaggerated PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity as indicated by higher plasma ALT and AST levels, and more severe pathological changes including hepatocyte hypertrophy, lipid droplet accumulation and necrosis as well as inflammatory cell infiltration. These additive effects of HFD on PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity correlated with metabolic disturbance in liver and blood as well as up-regulation of hepatic proinflammatory cytokine genes. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that both serum and hepatic metabolite profiles of PFOA, HFD, or HFD-PFOA group were clearly differentiated from that of controls. PFOA affected more hepatic metabolites than HFD, but HFD showed positive interaction with PFOA on fatty acid metabolites including long chain fatty acids and acylcarnitines. Taken together, dietary high fat potentiates PFOA-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and necrotic cell death by disturbing hepatic metabolism and inducing inflammation. This study demonstrated, for the first time, that HFD increases the risk of PFOA in induction of hepatotoxicity.

TI Fluorinated Ionic Liquids: Properties and Applications
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Ionic liquids have become a green media for engineering applications due to exceptional physicochemical properties, such as their practically nonvolatile nature, null flammability, low melting point, high ionic conductivity, and thermal and electrochemical stability. This work aimed to select the best fluorinated ionic liquids for the following applications: recovery/recycling of perfluorocarbon contaminants such as greenhouse perfluorocarbons gases and perfluoroalkyl acids of industrial effluents that are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic, and the partial or total replacement of inert perfluorocarbons in oxygen therapeutic emulsions by enhancing the emulsion stability and increasing the solubility of respiratory gas. With this dual goal in mind, thermodynamic and thermophysical properties of fluorinated ionic liquids (FILs) and their toxicity and biocompatibility are discussed so that the feasibility of the proposed applications can be evaluated. Herein, FILs are defined as ionic liquids with fluorinated chain lengths equal or greater than four carbon atoms. This paper provides a critical review of the experimental data for fluorinated ionic liquids available in the literature, and subsequently, with the aim of expanding knowledge of FILs, eight new fluorinated ionic liquids were selected for characterization. The attained results will clearly impact applications using polyfluorinated compounds.

TI Hydrodynamic effect of oxygenated byproduct during Fischer-Tropsch
   synthesis in slurry bubble column
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING AND PROCESSING-PROCESS INTENSIFICATION
AB The Fischer-Tropsch reaction was performed using a pilot-scale slurry bubble column reactor (SBCR) and a lab-scale continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). In contrast to the CSTR, a transitory induction period was observed in the SBCR. In this study, we investigated the catalyst performance during the induction period focusing on the hydrodynamic parameter changes inside the reactor. We measured the hydraulic pressure for the constant slurry thickness during FTS reaction. The FT wax product was regularly withdrawn using a metal filter and analyzed for density, oxygen concentration, and compositional analysis. The liquid density was affected by the dilution of the initial liquid media by fresh FT product for the whole reaction time of 180 h. On the other hand, the oxygen concentration increased sharply for the initial 85 h and then reached the steady state. Accordingly, the gas hold-up and CO conversion were enhanced for the same period. The increase in the gas hold-up could be explained by the coalescence inhibition effect of oxygenated compounds, which were the main byproducts when iron-based catalysts were used. The dynamic gas disengagement technique was employed to identify the coalescence inhibition effect of alcohol in the hydrocarbon system using a cylindrical acrylic bubble column.

TI Environmental influences on the development of endometriosis
SO JOURNAL OF ENDOMETRIOSIS AND PELVIC PAIN DISORDERS
AB Purpose: Several environmental toxicants (ETs), including dioxins and dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), perfluorochemicals, organochlorine pesticides, phthalates, and heavy metals (especially cadmium with its estrogen-like properties in animal models) have been investigated as possibly being related to endometriosis.
   Methods: Systematic review of pertinent literature.
   Results: DLCs have been the most investigated ETs. DLCs are persistent organic pollutants with highly toxic potential and include three types of compounds: polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) or furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The most toxic is 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The connection mechanism between dioxins and endometriosis is still unclear. However, dioxins and DLCs are endocrine-disrupting compounds that can affect the pathobiology of endometriosis at multiple levels. Part of the dioxin and DLCs toxic effects can be accounted for by their interaction with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). It has been proposed that dioxin can initiate or promote endometriosis by means of interaction with estrogen receptors or by suppressing the expression of progesterone receptors. Furthermore, TCDD alters the expression of cytokines and growth factors, remodeling enzymes and cytochrome P450 expression and activity.
   Conclusions: Studies in rhesus models have revealed a correlation between dioxin exposure and endometriosis. However, evidence from epidemiologic studies is inconclusive.

TI Tracers - Past, present and future applications in CO2 geosequestration
SO APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
AB Chemical tracers have been used in various C capture and storage (CCS) projects worldwide primarily to provide information regarding subsurface migration of CO2 and to verify CO2 containment. Understanding the movement and interactions of CO2 in the subsurface is a challenging task considering the variety of states in which it exists (i.e. gas, liquid, supercritical, dissolved in water) and the range of possible storage mechanisms (i.e. residual or capillary trapping, dissolved in water, structural trapping or incorporation into minerals). This paper critically reviews several chemical tracer applications and case studies for CCS projects. In many instances, there are parallels (e. g. tracer classes and applications) between tracers in the oil and gas industry and in CCS. It has been shown that chemical tracers can complement geophysical measurements (e. g. seismic) in understanding the formation behaviour of CO2. Although tracers have been successfully used in many CCS projects, some fundamental information, for example partitioning and adsorption, about the behaviour of tracers is still lacking and this can be an issue when interpreting tracer data (e. g. determining leakage rates). In this paper the deployment and recovery of chemical tracers and their use on various CCS projects are described. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Gaseous phase studies of new copper(II) carboxylate complexes with
   tert-butylamine as potential precursors for chemical vapor deposition
   (CVD)
SO POLYHEDRON
AB Copper(II) carboxylate compounds with tert-butylamine of the general formula [Cu-2((BuNH2)-Bu-t)(2)(mu-O2CR)(4)], where R = CnF2n+1, n = 1-6, were synthesized in the reaction of copper(II) perfluorinated carboxylates with tert-butylamine generated in situ from tert-butyl isocyanate. The obtained complexes were characterized in the solid state and in the gaseous phase by electron impact mass spectrometry (EI MS), IR spectroscopy, and thermal analysis with the detection of evolved gases. In addition, during the recrystallization of the [Cu-2((BuNH2)-Bu-t)(2)(mu-O2CC3F7)(4)] complex the ((BuNH3)-Bu-t)(+)(C3F7CO2)(-) ion pair was isolated, and its X-ray structure was determined. As a result of a mass spectra analysis, the presence of metallated species in the gaseous phase was revealed. Among the species detected, the pseudomolecular ions [Cu-2((BuNH2)-Bu-t)(2)(mu-O2CR)(3)](+) were found. The fact confirmed the dimeric structure of the studied complexes with bridging carboxylates and axially N-coordinated amines. TGA studies demonstrated that copper transfer to the gaseous phase occurs at atmospheric pressure, which suggests that the obtained compounds can be promising precursors for chemical vapor deposition. The selected Cu(II) compounds were used in the preliminary CVD experiments, and the conformal copper layers were formed with no additional reducing agents. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of persistent organic pollutants on the developing respiratory
   and immune systems: A systematic review
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Background: Disruption of developing immune and respiratory systems by early-life exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPS) could result into reduced capacity to fight infections and increased risk to develop allergic manifestations later in life.
   Objectives: To systematically review the epidemiologic literature on the adverse effects of early-life exposure to POPs on respiratory health, allergy and the immune system in infancy, childhood and adolescence.
   Methods: Based on published guidelines for systematic reviews, two independent researchers searched for published articles in MEDLINE ad SCOPUS using defined keywords on POPs and respiratory health, immune function and allergy. Study eligibility criteria were defined to select the articles.
   Results: This review of 41 studies finds limited evidence for prenatal exposure to DDE, PCBs and dioxins and risk of respiratory infections. Evidence was limited also for postnatal exposure to PCBs, specifically ndl-PCBs, and reduced immune response after vaccination in childhood. The review indicates lack of association between postnatal exposure to PCBs/ndl-PCBs and risk of asthma-related symptoms. For the other exposure-outcome associations reviewed evidence was inadequate.
   Discussion and conclusion: Current epidemiological evidence suggests that early-life exposure to POPs can adversely influence immune and respiratory systems development. Heterogeneity between studies in exposure and outcome assessment and the small number of studies for any given exposure-outcome relationship currently make comparisons difficult and meta-analyses impossible. Also, mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Recommendations for significantly improving our understanding thus include harmonization of exposure and outcome assessment between studies, conduct of larger studies, long-term assessment of respiratory infections and asthma symptoms in order to identify critical periods of susceptibility, integration of the potential immunotoxic mechanisms of POPs, and use of new statistical tools to detangle the role of multiple exposures on multiple outcomes.

TI Environmental Contaminant Exposures and Preterm Birth: A Comprehensive
   Review
SO JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART B-CRITICAL REVIEWS
AB Preterm birth is a significant public health concern, as it is associated with high risk of infant mortality, various morbidities in both the neonatal period and later in life, and a significant societal economic burden. As many cases are of unknown etiology, identification of the contribution of environmental contaminant exposures is a priority in the study of preterm birth. This is a comprehensive review of all known studies published from 1992 through August 2012 linking maternal exposure to environmental chemicals during pregnancy with preterm birth. Using PubMed searches, studies were identified that examined associations between preterm birth and exposure to five categories of environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants, drinking-water contaminants, atmospheric pollutants, metals and metalloids, and other environmental contaminants. Individual studies were summarized and specific suggestions were made for future work in regard to exposure and outcome assessment methods as well as study design, with the recommendation of focusing on potential mediating toxicological mechanisms. In conclusion, no consistent evidence was found for positive associations between individual chemical exposures and preterm birth. By identifying limitations and addressing the gaps that may have impeded the ability to identify true associations thus far, this review can guide future epidemiologic studies of environmental exposures and preterm birth.

AB Follow-the-sun (FTS) software development is a strategy used to reduce the length of software projects that are developed across globally distributed locations. However, due to communication and collaboration challenges, software companies find it difficult to adopt this development strategy during task allocation and daily project handovers. In this study, we present results from a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) performed on papers published between 1990 and 2012. Our goal was to identify best practices and challenges for FTS implementation. We found 36 best practices and 17 challenges for FTS. These results are discussed in this paper in order to indicate opportunities for future research and make our results useful for the project managers.

TI Functional Star Polymers via Living Radical Polymerization-Designer
   Functional Nanospaces
SO KOBUNSHI RONBUNSHU
AB This comprehensive article summarizes our recent efforts to design functional star polymers via living radical polymerization as functional nanospaces for catalysis and molecular recognition. Metal-bearing star polymer catalysts are efficiently obtained from the ruthenium-mediated linking reaction of arm polymers in the presence of a ligand monomer. Star polymer catalysts (nanoreactors) were effective for oxidation of sec-alcohols, (asymmetric) hydrogenation of ketones, and living radical polymerization, performing activity, stability, functionality-tolerance, and practicability (catalyst recycle, easy product recovery) higher than conventional polymer catalysts and analogues of in-core metal complexes. Core-functionalized star polymer nanocapsules selectively capture and stimuli-responsively release functional molecules. The key is to condense functional groups such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), perfluoroalkane, and quaternary ammonium groups into the cores. Single-chain star polymers are created as a new class of star polymers via the self-folding of amphiphilic random copolymers with intramolecular hydrophobic interaction in water.

TI Causal Inference Considerations for Endocrine Disruptor Research in

SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF PUBLIC HEALTH, VOL 34
SE Annual Review of Public Health
AB Substantial population exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, combined with available biomarkers and public concern, has resulted in an explosion of human health effects research. At the same time, remarkable shifts in the regulations governing the composition of some consumer products that contain endocrine disruptors (EDs) has occurred. However, important questions remain as to the weight of evidence linking EDs to human health end points. In this review, we critically examine the literature linking ED exposures to child neurodevelopment, focusing in particular on two model exposures to demonstrate issues related to bioaccumulative [e. g., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)] and rapidly metabolized (e. g., phthalates) compounds, respectively. Issues of study design, confounding, and exposure measurement are considered. Given widespread exposure to these compounds, the potential public health consequences of even small effects on human health are substantial. Therefore, advancing our understanding of any impact calls for careful attention to the principles of causal inference.

TI Sub-picosecond delocalization in the excited state of conjugated
   homopolymers and donor-acceptor copolymers
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB In this feature article, we review and examine evidence that the primary photoexcited species in conjugated polymers is considerably delocalized. Localization occurs via a series of complex relaxation mechanisms on the <200 femtosecond time scale. We show that short-lived delocalization in the neutral excited state and charge separated state of bulk heterojunction blends might play an essential role in ensuring efficient formation of free charge carriers for photovoltaic applications. Finally, the additional parameter of intramolecular charge transfer character in the excited state of more recently developed donor-acceptor copolymers is discussed. Both delocalization and partial charge transfer reduce the binding of the electron and hole in photoexcited organic semiconductors and can help to overcome the bottleneck to macroscopic current generation in polymer solar cells.

TI Sequencing from dried blood spots in infants with "false positive"
   newborn screen for MCAD deficiency
SO MOLECULAR GENETICS AND METABOLISM
AB Background: Newborn screening (NBS) for medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD), one of the most common disorders identified, uses measurement of octanoylcarnitine (C8) from dried blood spots. In the state of Ohio, as in many places, primary care providers, with or without consultation from a metabolic specialist, may perform "confirmatory testing", with the final diagnostic decision returned to the state. Confirmatory testing may involve measurement of metabolites, enzyme analysis, mutation screening, or sequencing. We now report sequencing results for infants said to have "false positive" NBS results for MCAD deficiency, or who died before confirmatory testing could be performed.
   Methods: Dried blood spots (DBS) were obtained from all 18 available NBS cards identified as "false positive" by NBS for the 3 year period after screening began in Ohio in 2003 (N=20, thus 2 had no DBS available), and from all 6 infants with abnormal screens who died before confirmatory testing could be obtained. DNA extracted from DBS was screened for the common c.985A>G mutation in exon 11 of the ACADM gene, using a specific restriction digest method, followed by sequencing of the 12 exons, intron-exon junctions, and several hundred base pairs of the 5' untranslated region.
   Results: The NBS cut-off value for C8 used was 0.7 mu mol/L Sequencing of ACADM in six neonates with elevated C8 on NBS who died before confirmatory testing was obtained did not identify any significant variants in the coding region of the gene, suggesting that MCADD was not a contributing factor in these deaths. The mean C8 for the 18 surviving infants labeled as "False Positives" was 0.90 (95%CI 0.77-1.15), much lower than the mean value for confirmed cases. Ten of the 18 were premature births weighing <1200 g, the rest were normal sized and full term. Eight infants, mostly full term with appropriate birth weight were heterozygous for the common c.985A>G mutation; one of those also has a novel sequence change identified in exon 9 that predicts a PRO to LEU change at residue 258 of the protein. Both the phase and any possible clinical significance of the variant are unknown, but several lines of evidence suggest that it could lead to protein malfunction. That child had an NBS C8 of 22, more than double the mean for the False Positive group. Unfortunately, the study design did not provide clinical outcome data, but the child is not known to have presented clinically by age 7 years.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that sequencing of ACADM from dried blood spots can be one useful follow-up tool to provide accurate genetic counseling in the situation of an infant with elevated C8 on NBS who dies before confirmatory testing is obtained. Of surviving neonates, there appear to be two populations of infants with false positive NBS C8 values: 1) term AGA infants who are heterozygous for the common c.985A>G mutation, and, 2) premature infants, regardless of carrier status. The finding of two sequence variants in an infant reported to the state as not affected suggests the possibility that some infants with two mutations may be reported as normal at follow-up. State registries may wish to consider asking that metabolic specialists, who are most familiar with the variability of these rare disorders, be involved in the final diagnostic evaluation. Finally, providers may wish to consider ACADM sequencing, or other diagnostic testing, as part of the confirmatory evaluation for infants with NBS C8 concentrations that are significantly above the cut-off value, even if plasma and urine metabolites are not strikingly increased.

AB The occurrence of disinfection by-products (DBPs), especially trihalomethanes (THMs) in chlorinated drinking water has been well documented. Due to their adverse health effects, especially carcinogenicity, THMs have been regulated in drinking water by the American Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Union (EU). In order to minimize their formation, chloramination has been applied in water treatment plants, leading to lower concentrations of THMs, but resulting in formation of N-nitrosamines, including N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a probable human carcinogen. Nitrosamines, mainly NDMA, are mutagenic compounds and are suspected to be carcinogenic towards humans. In 2002, Mitch and Sedlak as well as Choi and Valentine reported that NDMA is formed during disinfection of dimethylamine (DMA) containing water or treated wastewater with chloramines. Moreover in 2007 Andrzejewski and Nawrocki reported that not only chloramination but also other oxidants (particularly ozone and chlorine dioxide) applied in water/wastewater treatment leads to formation of NDMA, when dimethylamine is present in raw water. Currently, according to the results of many experiments, formation of NDMA during reactions of strong oxidants, particularly chloramines, with waters containing DMA seems to be proved. US EPA has classified NDMA into the group B2 i.e. compounds which are probably carcinogenic to humans. In 2008 the WHO placed NDMA on the list of DBPs related to application of chloramines in water/wastewater treatment. The precursors of DBPs have been the focus of recent research, in order to understand the mechanisms involved in their formation, in an effort to minimize it. Natural Organic Matter (NOM) components in raw water act as precursors for the formation of both THMs and NDMA. In addition, anthropogenic emerging pollutants (e.g. pharmaceuticals, herbicides), have been shown to result in THMs and NDMA formation, during chlorination or chloramination. Emerging pollutants are increasingly detected in raw water and they cannot be effectively removed with conventional treatment, creating concern for the water quality, in regard to the formation of THMs and NDMA. The aim of this paper is the presentation and critical review of recent findings in the sector of THMs and NDMA precursors research in raw water, in particular NOM, pharmaceuticals and herbicides. Relevant studies are reviewed, with emphasis on the formation mechanisms, the compounds that can act as DBP precursors, and the levels of THMs and NDMA detected in disinfected waters. Finally, applications and proposals for minimization of precursors' occurrence and THMs and N DMA formation are compared and discussed in the light of the current scientific knowledge.

TI Substrate Induced Thermal Decomposition of Perfluoro-Pentacene Thin
   Films on the Coinage Metals
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The thermal and chemical stability of perfluoropentacene (PFP) thin films grown by organic molecular beam deposition onto the (111)-oriented surfaces of the coinage metals copper, silver, and gold have been studied by means of temperature dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Near-Edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS). Under vacuum conditions, PFP multilayers are completely desorbed at 425 K while molecules in contact with the Au(111) surface remain intact up to 500 K. By contrast, PFP that is in contact with Cu(111) is distinctly distorted and becomes partially, defluorinated already upon thermal desorption of rnultilayers. A pronounced defluorination of PEP also takes place on Ag(111) at temperatures around 440 K, while further heating causes a complete cracking and defluorination. Additional measurements carried out on a regularly stepped silver surface demonstrate that steps are active sites that promote defluorination already at lower temperatures. van der Waals corrected density-functional (DFT-D) calculations show that PFP, though being weakly adsorbed on all three metal surfaces, exhibits a reduced energy barrier for defluorination, in particular on copper and silver, thus reflecting their catalytic activity. The calculations reveal further that defluorinated molecules are covalently bound to the substrate, leading to a notable bending of the molecular backbone. The present study highlights the importance of also considering chemical reactions when theoretically analyzing molecule/metal interactions and indicates that fluorinated aromatic molecules, though offering interesting electronic properties, actually exhibit a limited stability in contact with some electrode surfaces like silver due to catalytic effects.

TI Computational Evidence That Frequency Trajectory Theory Does Not Oppose

SO COGNITIVE SCIENCE
AB According to the age-of-acquisition hypothesis, words acquired early in life are processed faster and more accurately than words acquired later. Connectionist models have begun to explore the influence of the age/order of acquisition of items (and also their frequency of encounter). This study attempts to reconcile two different methodological and theoretical approaches (proposed by Lambon Ralph & Ehsan, 2006 and Zevin & Seidenberg, 2002) to age-limited learning effects. The current simulations extend the findings reported by Zevin and Seidenberg (2002) that have shown that frequency trajectories (FTs) have limited and specific effects on word-reading tasks. Using the methodological framework proposed by Lambon Ralph and Ehsan (2006), which makes it possible to compare word-reading and picture-naming tasks in connectionist networks, we were able to show that FT has a considerable influence on age-limited learning effects in a picture naming task. The findings show that when the inputoutput mappings are arbitrary (simulating picture naming tasks), the links formed by the network become entrenched as a result of early experience and that subsequent variations in frequency of exposure of the items have only a minor impact. In contrast, when the mappings between input-output are quasi-systematic or systematic (simulating word-reading tasks), the training of new items was generalized and resulted in the suppression of age-limited learning effects. At a theoretical level, we suggest that FT, which simultaneously takes account of time and the level of exposure across time, represents a more precise and modulated measure compared with the order of introduction of the items and may lead to innovative hypotheses in the field of age-limited learning effects.

TI Enteral Feeding Tubes in Patients Undergoing Definitive Chemoradiation
   Therapy for Head-and-Neck Cancer: A Critical Review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
AB Definitive chemoradiation therapy has evolved as the preferred organ preservation strategy in the treatment of locally advanced head-and-neck cancer (LA-HNC). Dry mouth and dysphagia are among the most common and most debilitating treatment-related toxicities that frequently necessitate the placement of enteral feeding tubes (FT) in these patients to help them meet their nutritional requirements. The use of either a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube or a nasogastric tube, the choice of using a prophylactic vs a reactive approach, and the effects of FTs on weight loss, hospitalization, quality of life, and long-term functional outcomes are areas of continued controversy. Considerable variations in practice patterns exist in the United States and abroad. This critical review synthesizes the current data for the use of enteral FTs in this patient population and clarifies the relative advantages of different types of FTs and the timing of their use. Recent developments in the biologic understanding and treatment approaches for LA-HNC appear to be favorably impacting the frequency and severity of treatment-related dysphagia and may reduce the need for enteral tube feeding in the future.

TI Role of elective cesarean section in prevention of pelvic floor
   disorders
SO CURRENT OPINION IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
AB Purpose of review
   The article reviews the current evidence and the role of elective Cesarean section in the prevention of pelvic floor disorders (PFDs).
   Recent findings
   Recent studies have revealed that operative vaginal delivery is an important risk factor for PFDs. The cause of PFD is multifactorial. Pregnancy itself also increases the PFDs. Elective Cesarean section carries diminished risk for stress urinary incontinence. Pelvic floor muscle training should be offered to all women in their first pregnancy as a preventive strategy.
   Summary
   The health provider should not offer elective Cesarean section to a pregnant woman without any prior risk of pelvic organ disorder for the prevention of urinary stress incontinence, anal incontinence, or pelvic organ prolapsus weighing the risks of Cesarean section.

TI Time-trends of metals and organic contaminants in sewage sludge
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB The occurrence of chemicals in sludge from sewage treatment plants (STPs) is of concern for human health and the environment. Legislations and regulations are put in place to minimize the release of harmful chemicals into the environment and arable land, e.g. via application of sewage sludge. Temporal trends analysis of sludge contaminants can be used to assess the effectiveness of such actions. Such analyses can be performed retrospectively, using sludge stored in environmental specimen banks, to investigate new or emerging environmental contaminants. The present study provides data from time-trend analyses of metals, persistent organic pollutants, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and other organic compounds in sludge from Swedish. The analysis showed that sludge is a suitable matrix for time-trend studies and it can take on average 12 years (range, 5-26 years) to track an annual change of +/- 10% (with a power of 80%). Statistically significant trends were found for 18 out of the 77 compounds subjected to analysis, of which 75% showed decreasing trends. Triclosan and the antibiotic norfloxacin followed the same trend as the national recorded usage and decreased annually by 65% and 60%, respectively. The opposite was true for the methylsiloxanes, which showed an annual average increase of about 30%. A downward trend (about 20% year(-1)) was observed for the polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs 154 and 183), while PBDE 209 increased by 16%. Further measurements are required to determine if the substitution of PBDEs by chlorinated paraffins or organophosphorus compounds have resulted in increased concentrations of the latter in sludge.

TI The intraparotid facial nerve schwannoma: a diagnostic and management
   conundrum
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY
AB Objectives: The aims of the study were (1) to review the management strategy and clinical outcomes of all intraparotid facial nerve (FN) schwannomas (PFNSs) treated at a single tertiary academic center from 1975 to 2010 and (2) to summarize all previously reported cases of PFNS in the international literature.
   Study design: A retrospective cohort study and literature review.
   Methods: Fifteen patients were diagnosed and treated at the authors' institution from 1975 to 2010. In addition, 124 published cases were systematically reviewed.
   Results: The most common presentation of PFNS was a painless parotid mass with normal FN function. Eccentric, loosely attached intraparotid tumors underwent gross total resection with nerve preservation granting satisfactory postoperative FN function, whereas "inseparable" intraparotid tumors were observed in 8 cases with stable long-term size. Lesions that extended into the fallopian canal underwent complete resection with FN sacrifice and nerve grafting in 10 cases, whereas 1 patient received subtotal resection of the intraparotid portion with stereotactic radiotherapy targeting the intratemporal component.
   Conclusions: Intraparotid FN schwannomas present similar to other primary salivary gland neoplasms, making an early diagnosis challenging. Intraoperative recognition of gross tumor characteristics and early histologic diagnosis with strategic biopsy are critical. Information including tumor location and extent, preoperative FN function, and the gross relationship between the tumor and the FN may guide the surgeon toward an optimal treatment plan emphasizing long-term neurologic preservation.

TI Biosynthesis of fucoxanthin and diadinoxanthin and function of initial
   pathway genes in Phaeodactylum tricornutum
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB The biosynthesis pathway to diadinoxanthin and fucoxanthin was elucidated in Phaeodactylum tricornutum by a combined approach involving metabolite analysis identification of gene function. For the initial steps leading to -carotene, putative genes were selected from the genomic database and the function of several of them identified by genetic pathway complementation in Escherichia coli. They included genes encoding a phytoene synthase, a phytoene desaturase, a ?-carotene desaturase, and a lycopene -cyclase. Intermediates of the pathway beyond -carotene, present in trace amounts, were separated by TLC and identified as violaxanthin and neoxanthin in the enriched fraction. Neoxanthin is a branching point for the synthesis of both diadinoxanthin and fucoxanthin and the mechanisms for their formation were proposed. A single isomerization of one of the allenic double bounds in neoxanthin yields diadinoxanhin. Two reactions, hydroxylation at C8 in combination with a keto-enol tautomerization and acetylation of the 3-HO group results in the formation of fucoxanthin.

TI Management of Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Individuals with
   Chronic Spinal Cord Injury: An Evidence-Based Review
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA
AB Clinical scenario: A 37-year-old man suffered a complete spinal cord injury (C8, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale [ASIA] score A) 10 years ago in a car accident. Should primary prevention of cardiovascular disease be a priority in this patient? In order to answer this question, we performed a systematic review of the literature to inform an evidence-based clinical review. The objective was to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the clinical management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Comprehensive literature searches were performed. The quality of each study was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale for randomized controlled trials, and the Downs and Black Scale for all other studies. Levels of evidence were assigned using a modified version of Sackett's scale. Our findings indicate that CVD is a critical issue in individuals with chronic SCI. Almost all risk factors for CVD are amplified in individuals with SCI, including physical inactivity, dyslipidemia, blood pressure irregularities, abnormal glycemic control, and chronic inflammation. However, there is a paucity of high-quality literature with respect to treatment outcomes in SCI-specific study populations (a total of 22 intervention studies in all of these categories combined) that allow for the development of evidence-informed clinical practice recommendations. These limitations notwithstanding, we present a series of contemporary practice suggestions with regard to CVD event risk modification in SCI patients. For optimal outcomes, health care providers should be cognizant of these heightened CVD risk factors and the resultant increased CVD morbidity and mortality in SCI patients. Despite the absence of high-quality evidence-based treatment strategies, clinicians should re-examine their own CVD risk factor treatment strategies to better reflect contemporary practice in similar high-CVD-event-risk patients and populations.

TI Influence of the neurological level of spinal cord injury on
   cardiovascular outcomes in humans: a meta-analysis
SO SPINAL CORD
AB Background: Although motor and sensory deficits following spinal cord injury (SCI) are well known, there are still contrasting reports on how SCI affects baseline cardiovascular (CV) parameters and other autonomic functions.
   Study design: Meta-analysis is performed.
   Objectives: To examine the effect of injury level on supine and seated CV function in individuals with SCI.
   Methods: A total of 98 studies representing 1968 individuals were retrieved for analysis. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were abstracted from the studies and compared between four groups according to the neurological lesion level, cervical (C) SCI (C4-C8), high-thoracic (HT) SCI (T1-T6), low-thoracic lumbar (LTL) SCI (below T6) and able-bodied (AB) controls.
   Results: In the supine position, SBP, DBP and HR were lower in C compared with HT, LTL and AB (all P<0.04). In the seated position, SBP and DBP were significantly lower in C compared with LTL and AB (all P<0.003) and HR was significantly lower in C compared with LTL only (P-0.01). A final finding was that C exhibited a lower resting SBP in the seated compared with the supine position (P<0.001).
   Conclusion: Individuals with SCI exhibit a lesion-dependent impairment in resting CV function, whereby those with the highest injury had the greatest degree of CV dysfunction. A further finding was that individuals with a C injury exhibited a lower resting SBP in the seated vs supine position. Thus, clinicians and researchers should consider lesion level and body position when measuring and interpreting CV parameters in individuals with SCI.

TI Determination of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and their
   metabolites in milk by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
SO ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely used for treatment of animals. According to Council Directive 96/23/EC, residues of these drugs must be monitored because of the potential risk they pose to the consumers' health. For this reason an LC-MS-MS method was developed for detection of wide range of NSAIDs, including both "acidic" NSAIDs (carprofen, diclofenac, flunixin, meloxicam, phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, tolfenamic acid, mefenamic acid, naproxen, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, firocoxib, rofecoxib, and celecoxib) and "basic" NSAIDs (four metamizole metabolites). Analytes were extracted from milk samples with acetonitrile in the presence of ammonium acetate. One portion of the extract was directly analyzed for the presence of metamizole metabolites; a second portion was cleaned with an amino cartridge. All NSAIDs were separated on a Phenomenex Luna C8(2) column and analyzed by LC-MS-MS in negative (acidic NSAIDs) and positive (metamizole metabolites) ion modes. The method was validated in accordance with the requirements of Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. Within-laboratory reproducibility was in the range 7-28%, and accuracy was in the range 71-116%. The method enabled detection of all the analytes with the expected sensitivity, below the recommended concentrations. The method fulfills the criteria for confirmatory methods and, because of its efficiency, may also be used for screening purposes. The procedure was also successfully verified in the proficiency test organized by EU-RL in 2010. As far as the authors are aware, this is one of the first methods capable of detecting diclofenac residues below the MRL in milk (0.1 mu g kg(-1)). An additional advantage is the possibility of simultaneous determination of "acidic" NSAIDs and metamizole metabolites.

TI Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), an emerging drinking water contaminant: A
   critical review of recent literature
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is an anthropogenic contaminant that differs in several ways from most other well-studied organic chemicals found in drinking water. PFOA is extremely resistant to environmental degradation processes and thus persists indefinitely. Unlike most other persistent and bioaccumulative organic pollutants, PFOA is water-soluble, does not bind well to soil or sediments, and bioaccumulates in serum rather than in fat. It has been detected in finished drinking water and drinking water sources impacted by releases from industrial facilities and waste water treatment plants, as well as in waters with no known point sources. However, the overall occurrence and population exposure from drinking water is not known. PFOA persists in humans with a half-life of several years and is found in the serum of almost all U.S. residents and in populations worldwide. Exposure sources include food, food packaging, consumer products, house dust, and drinking water. Continued exposure to even relatively low concentrations in drinking water can substantially increase total human exposure, with a serum:drinking water ratio of about 100:1. For example, ongoing exposures to drinking water concentrations of 10 ng/L, 40 ng/L, 100 ng/L or 400 ng/L are expected to increase mean serum levels by about 25%, 100%, 250%, and 1000%, respectively, from the general population background serum level of about 4 ng/mL Infants are potentially a sensitive sub-population for PFOA's developmental effects, and their exposure through breast milk from mothers who use contaminated drinking water and/or from formula prepared with contaminated drinking water is higher than in adults exposed to the same drinking water concentration. Numerous health endpoints are associated with human PFOA exposure in the general population, communities with contaminated drinking water, and workers. As is the case for most such epidemiology studies, causality for these effects is not proven. Unlike most other well-studied drinking water contaminants, the human dose-response curve for several effects appears to be steepest at the lower exposure levels, including the general population range, with no apparent threshold for some endpoints. There is concordance in animals and humans for some effects, while humans and animals appear to react differently for other effects such as lipid metabolism. PFOA was classified as "likely to be carcinogenic in humans" by the USEPA Science Advisory Board. In animal studies, developmental effects have been identified as more sensitive endpoints for toxicity than carcinogenicity or the long-established hepatic effects. Notably, exposure to an environmentally relevant drinking water concentration caused adverse effects on mammary gland development in mice. This paper reviews current information relevant to the assessment of PFOA as an emerging drinking water contaminant. This information suggests that continued human exposure to even relatively low concentrations of PFOA in drinking water results in elevated body burdens that may increase the risk of health effects.

TI Syntheses utilizing n-perfluoroalkyl iodides [RFI, CnF2n+1-I] 2000-2010
SO JOURNAL OF FLUORINE CHEMISTRY
AB This review presents a comprehensive assessment of the synthetic utility of n-perfluoroalkyl iodides (RFI, CnF2n+1-I, where n = 2-14) in the published literature from 2000 through 2010. RFI is a versatile synthetic reagent widely utilized to introduce the perfluoroalkyl functionality and its unique functional characteristics into organic substances. Two distinct analysis tools were employed. First, Reaxys (R) was employed to examine the versatility and occurrences of RFI in 1356 non-polymeric synthetic transformations. The most common RFI synthetic conversions were (i) free-radical addition to carbon-carbon double or triple bonds, (ii) coupling to aryl halides, and (iii) Grignard, organolithium, or similar R-F anion addition to ketones and aldehydes. RFI were also used as a chain transfer reagent in free-radical polymerization reactions of fluorinated and other unsaturated monomers. Second, a complementary Chemical Abstracts' STN AnaVist (R) search was employed to summarize the 779 publications describing reaction products that contained n-perfluoroalkyl chains (CnF2n+1-, where n = 2-4). The most common uses for materials into which RFI was incorporated were surfactants, pesticides, electronic materials, pharmaceuticals, liquid crystals, dyes and optical materials, battery electrolytes, repellents, lubricants and polymerization catalysts.

TI Automatic microemulsion preparation for metals determination in fuel
   samples using a flow-batch analyzer and graphite furnace atomic
   absorption spectrometry
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB The principal thermodynamic advantages of using microemulsions over standard emulsions for flow metal analysis are the greatly increased analyte stability and emulsive homogeneity that improve both the ease of sample preparation, and the analytical result. In this study a piston propelled flow-batch analyzer (PFBA) for the determination of Cu, Cr and Pb in gasoline and naphtha by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF AAS) was explored. Investigative phase modeling for low dilution was conducted both for gasoline and naphtha microemulsions. Rheological considerations were also explored including a mathematical flow derivation to fine tune the system's operational parameters, and the GF MS coupling. Both manual and automated procedures for microemulsion preparation were compared. The results of the paired t test at a 95% confidence level showed no significant differences between them. Further recovery test results confirmed a negligible matrix effect of the sample on the analyte absorption signals and an efficient stabilization of the samples (with metals) submitted to microemulsion treatment. The accuracy of the developed procedure was attested by good recovery percentages in the ranges of 100.0 +/- 3.5% for Pb in the naphtha samples, and 100.2 +/- 3.4% and 100.7 +/- 4.6% for Cu and Cr, respectively in gasoline samples.

TI Standardization of Egg Collection from Aquatic Birds for Biomonitoring -
   A Critical Review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Collecting bird eggs is an established method of biomonitoring for specific pollution hazards. One of the most critical problems with this method is the extreme biological variability in bird eggs, but standardizing the collection and preservation of eggs can reduce these problems. Furthermore, standard practices are required so that the results can be compared among studies because mistakes cannot be corrected by laboratory analysis. Therefore, a standard procedure for collecting and preserving bird eggs may be necessary. The objective of this review is to investigate the current standard of quality assurance in the field by analyzing 86 peer-reviewed papers describing egg collection and use for aquatic birds. We show that little attention has been paid to standardizing how eggs are collected and stored in the field. Important information is often absent, including crucial aspects of sample collection and preservation, such as the freshness of the eggs, the position of the eggs in the laying sequence, the selection criteria, random sampling, and the duration and temperature of transport. Potential standards are suggested and discussed as a foundation for the development of quality assurance standards in the field.

TI Treatment of Trochanteric Fractures with Proximal Femoral Nail
   Antirotation or Dynamic Hip Screw Systems: a Meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis to compare the intraoperative and postoperative outcome data for the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) and dynamic hip screw (DHS) implant systems for the treatment of patients with trochanteric fractures. METHODS: A detailed search of several electronic databases was undertaken to identify randomized controlled trials published before 5 December 2011 that compared PFNA with DHS in patients with trochanteric fractures. RESULTS: A quantitative meta-analysis of 11 studies including 798 patients was performed. PFNA was associated with significant reductions in duration of surgery (weighted mean difference [WMD] -21.38 min; 95% confidence interval [CI] -33.50, -9.26 min), intraoperative blood loss (WMD -176.36 ml; 95% Cl -232.20, -120.52 ml), rate of fixation failure (relative risk [RR] 0.27, 95% CI 0.11, 0.62) and rate of postoperative complications (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.31, 0.70) compared with DHS. CONCLUSION: The use of PFNA for treatment of trochanteric fractures was found to be superior to DHS in terms of the duration of surgery, intraoperative blood loss, and rates of fixation failure and overall complications.

TI In situ derivatization-liquid liquid extraction as a sample preparation
   strategy for the determination of urinary biomarker
   prolyl-4-hydroxyproline by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry
SO JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY
AB Polar analytes that possess protic functional groups have often been treated with alkyl chloroformates to decrease their polarity and increase their volatility prior to gas chromatographymass spectrometry analysis. This derivatization reaction has two distinct advantages. It proceeds smoothly in aqueous media, and the desired reaction products are efficiently separated from interfering ionic components by their extraction into a water-immiscible organic phase. In the present work, the derivatizationliquid liquid sample preparation was examined in detail for analysis of a potential urinary dipeptide biomarker l-prolyl-4-l-hydroxyproline (PHP) by downstream liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry. PHP was treated with a series of alkyl and fluoroalkyl chloroformates in aqueous media, and the detected reaction products were investigated. Smooth conversion of PHP into the N-isobutyloxycarbonyl isobutyl ester was accomplished by the coupled action of isobutanol, isobutyl chloroformate and the pyridine catalyst. This derivative afforded a highest detector response from all the derivatized forms examined, including the nonderivatized PHP. A simple isocratic elution on a common RP-C18 HPLC column coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, and use of the synthesized heptadeuterated analog (D7-PHP) as an internal standard, enabled validation of the method and determination of PHP in human urine in less than 5min. The in situ derivatizationliquid liquid extraction has thus been demonstrated to be a useful sample preparation strategy for the analysis of polar metabolites by liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry in the complex urine matrix.

TI Progress and perspective of perfluorinated compound risk assessment and
   management in various countries and institutes
SO CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
AB Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and related compounds have recently been designated as target chemicals for regulation by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). Many countries have investigated and tried to implement various countermeasures in response to this decision. In this article, we collect reports concerning regulations and risk evaluations of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and review the current PFC management practiced in various countries. The first part of this review contains a comprehensive collection of proposed standard PFC values, including provisional tolerable daily intakes (pTDI), drinking water guidelines, and predicted non-effect concentrations (PNEC). The pTDI values ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 mu g/kg/day for PFOS, and there are wide margins of safety for adults. Health risks for plant workers exposed to PFCs and for infants are of particular concern. The application of these proposed values in controlling PFC pollution is one approach that may effectively control human health risk without unduly sacrificing the benefits from PFC use. The second part of this review contains a collection and review of a number of regulations and countermeasures, such as an EU directive, regulation in Canada, and the Significant New Use Rule (SNUR), including voluntary control (i.e., production phase-out by 3M, stewardship programs, regulation in the semiconductor industry). Most of these regulations are based principally on the precautionary principle. However, they may not be as effective in pollution reduction as intended because the chemicals in question are already widely distributed in the environment owing to their use and mobility in the environment. In addition, these types of regulations would be non-operative in developing countries because rapidly growing economies place great demand on high performance materials, including PFCs. Further development of risk assessment methods that allow the evaluation of the counter risks of PFC alternatives and the loss of benefits from the PFC ban is necessary because of the possible continuous use of PFCs, especially in developing countries.

TI H-1 NMR metabolomics of Eisenia fetida responses after sub-lethal
   exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY
AB Metabolomics entails the analysis of endogenous metabolites within organisms exposed to an external stressor such as an environmental contaminant. We utilised H-1 NMR-based metabolomics to elucidate sub-lethal toxic mechanisms of Eisenia fetida earthworms after exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Earthworms were exposed to a range of concentrations of PFOA (6.25 to 50 mu g cm(-2)) and PFOS (3.125 to 25 mu g cm(-2)) by contact tests for 2 days. Earthworm tissues were extracted using a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water, and the polar fraction was analysed by H-1 NMR spectroscopy. NMR-based metabolomic analysis revealed heightened E. fetida toxic responses with higher PFOA and PFOS exposure concentrations. Principal component analysis (PCA) exhibited significant separation between control and exposed earthworms along PC1 for all PFOA and PFOS exposure concentrations. Leucine, arginine, glutamate, maltose and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are potential indicators of PFOA and PFOS exposure as these metabolite concentrations fluctuated with exposure. Our data also indicate that PFOA and PFOS exposure may increase fatty acid oxidation and interrupt ATP synthesis due to a disruption in the inner mitochondrial membrane structure. NMR-based metabolomics has promise as an insightful tool for elucidating the environmental toxicology of sub-lethal contaminant exposure.

TI The Potential Role of Flexible Transport Services in Enhancing Rural
   Public Transport Provision
SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
AB This paper explores the existing context of public transport provision in rural and remote areas illustrated with experience from Scotland. A critical review of existing Flexible Transport Services (FTS) in rural areas is provided and illustrated with selected case studies, with the objective of identifying the extent to which FTS can enhance the public transport offer. Findings confirm that FTS offers considerable potential to contribute to and support the public transport system in rural areas; however, the paper also identifies the many challenges in successful development or enhancement of FTS in rural areas.

SO JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY

CL College Station, TX
AB The basin of Moulouya Oued is a region where mining industry has been developed early in the 20th century. As a consequence, residues generated from past mining activities over the years have been dumped as piles of tailings. Za < da is one of the most affected region in this basin because of lead mine exploitation for long time. The aim of this study is to determine the amount of trace elements and the contamination of the river sediments. Analysis of collected samples has been achieved using the prompt gamma activation analysis method. The samples, in form of powders, were enclosed in Teflon sheets. The spectra were analyzed using HYPERMET PC software and the chemical composition is calculated using an Excel-macro that provides the concentrations as molar and weight percentages, as well as the corresponding masses of the oxides. The validation of the analytical method is demonstrated with the analysis of a reference material. The results show that the distribution of the studied metals (Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr Ni, and As) in the basin is dependent on location with a very significant contamination by Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr, and Ni close to the lead mine sites.

TI DETERMINATION OF HEAVY METAL CONTENT IN VEGETABLES AND OILS FROM SPAIN
   AND MOROCCO BY INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA MASS SPECTROMETRY
SO ANALYTICAL LETTERS
AB An optimized inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method was used to analyze trace metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, and Sn) in vegetable and oil samples. Prior to analysis, the samples were accurately weighed into a Teflon digestion vessel and the metals extracted from their matrix by using nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide in a closed-vessel digestion system. The proposed method is sensitive, with limits of detection between 5 and 38 ng/kg, and precise, with relative standard deviations from 2.8 to 6.1%. In order to verify its accuracy, the method was used to analyze the Standard Reference Materials NCS ZC85006 Tomato and Certified Used Oil HU-1. The method was successfully applied to the comparative determination of residues of the studied metals in vegetable (tomato, pepper, onion, spinach, lettuce, carrots, and marrow squash) and oil samples (virgin olive, maize, sunflower, and olive pomace) from Spain and Morocco. The results obtained revealed that the contents in metal residues depend on the particular type of food and its origin, probably due to the different production, processing, storage, and preservation methods.

TI Plasma Levels of Polychlorinated Biphenyls, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, and
   Causation
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are synthetic chlorinated hydrocarbons that have extensively polluted the environment and bioaccumulated in the food chain. PCBs have been deemed to be probable carcinogens by the Environmental Protection Agency, and exposure to high levels of PCBs has been consistently linked to increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In the present article we present a forensic epidemiologic evaluation of the causal relationship between NHL and elevated PCB levels via application of the Bradford-Hill criteria. Included in the evaluation is a meta-analysis of the results of previously published case-control studies in order to assess the strength of association between NHL and PCBs, resulting in an odds ratio in which the lowest percentile PCB concentration (quartile, quintile, or tertile) has been compared with the highest percentile concentration in the study groups. The weight-adjusted odds ratio for all PCB congeners was 1.43 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.31 to 1.55, indicating a statistically significant causal association with NHL. Because of the lack of an unexposed comparison group, a rationale for the use of a less than 2.0 relative risk causal contribution threshold is presented herein, including an ecologic analysis of NHL incidence and PCB accumulation (as measured by sales volume) over time. The overall results presented here indicate a strong general causal association between NHL and PCB exposure.

TI Chemical characterization and factor analysis of PM2.5 in two sites of
   Monterrey, Mexico
SO JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
AB The Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA) has shown a high concentration of PM2.5 in its atmosphere since 2003. The contribution of possible sources of primary PM2.5 and its precursors is not known. In this paper we present the results of analyzing the chemical composition of sixty 24-hr samples of PM2.5 to determine possible sources of PM2.5 in the MMA. The samples were collected at the northeast and southeast of the MMA between November 22 and December 12, 2007, using low-volume devices. Teflon and quartz filters were used to collect the samples. The concentrations of 16 airborne trace elements were determined using x-ray fluorescence (XRF). Anions and cations were determined using ion chromatography. Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were determined by thermal optical analysis. The results show that Ca had the maximum mean concentration of all elements studied, followed by S. Enrichment factors above 50 were calculated for S, Cl, Cu, Zn, Br, and Pb. This indicates that these elements may come from anthropogenic sources. Overall, the major average components of PM2.5 were OC (41.7%), SO42- (22.9%), EC (7.4%), crustal material (11.4%), and NO3- (12.6%), which altogether accounted for 96% of the mass. Statistically, we did not find any difference in SO42- concentrations between the two sites. The fraction of secondary organic carbon was between 24% and 34%. The results of the factor analysis performed over 10 metals and OC and EC show that there are three main sources of PM2.5: crustal material and vehicle exhaust; industrial activity; and fuel oil burning. The results show that SO42-, OC, and crustal material are important components of PM2.5 in MMA. Further work is necessary to evaluate the proportion of secondary inorganic and organic aerosol in order to have a better understanding of the sources and precursors of aerosols in the MMA.
   Implications: The MMA has become one of the most air polluted areas in Mexico. High levels of PM2.5 have been measured and effective actions need to be taken to reduce air pollution and the associated health risks. Several sources of primary PM2.5 and precursors of secondary particles exist in the MMA. This study provides valuable information for the local environmental authorities to identify possible sources of primary PM2.5 and its precursors. The effectiveness of the actions taken to improve air quality will lead to health benefits for the population, reducing their associated costs.

AB Spectroelectrochemistry provides improved selectivity for sensors by electrochemically modulating the optical signal associated with the analyte. The sensor consists of an optically transparent electrode (OTE) coated with a film that preconcentrates the target analyte. The OTE functions as an optical waveguide for attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectroscopy, which detects the analyte by absorption. Alternatively, the OTE can serve as the excitation light for fluorescence detection, which is generally more sensitive than absorption. The analyte partitions into the film, undergoes an electrochemical redox reaction at the OTE surface, and absorbs or emits light in its oxidized or reduced state. The change in the optical response associated with electrochemical oxidation or reduction at the OTE is used to quantify the analyte. Absorption sensors for metal ion complexes such as [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) and [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) and fluorescence sensors for [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 1-hydroxypyrene have been developed. The sensor concept has been extended to binding assays for a protein using avidin-biotin and 17 beta-estradiol-anti-estradiol antibodies. The sensor has been demonstrated to measure metal complexes in complex samples such as nuclear waste and natural water. This sensor has qualities needed for security and defense applications that require a high level of selectivity and good detection limits for target analytes in complex samples. Quickly monitoring and designating intent of a nuclear program by measuring the Ru/Tc fission product ratio is such an application.

TI Metal complexes of vic-dioximes for chemical gas sensing
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB Metal complexes of vic-dioximes are characterized as new candidate materials for volatile organic compound sensing with sorption based chemical gas sensors. They are proposed as an interesting alternative to conventional sensing materials with metal ion centers such as phthalocyanines or porphyrins. Besides, they are considered an appealing platform to study metal effects on analyte sorption and sensor performance due to a high variety in possible metal centers. In this work, the sensing properties are explored with the quartz crystal microbalance on the basis of a set of vic-dioximes complexes varied in their metal ion centers (Ni(2+), Pd(2+), Cu(2+), Co(2+)) and substituents (alkyl chain lengths from C(3)H(7) up to C(7)H(15)) and twelve selected analytes. Depending on the metal center and substituents widely diverging selectivity patterns were observed indicating preferences for alcohols, amines, and aromatic compounds. The results presented in this work show that the proposed metal complexes of vic-dioximes are excellent sensing materials and very promising for the use in chemical gas sensor array applications.

TI Analysis of trace metals in single droplet of urine by laser ablation
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY
AB Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is now widely accepted as a universal and sensitive analytical technique in different research fields. In this project, we applied the technology to the analysis of complex matrix composition by using urine samples from Fabry disease patients and controls. The aims of the project were: (1) to develop a new and rapid analytical procedure for the determination of trace metal concentrations in single droplets of urine using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS); and (2) to establish preliminary results for trace metal concentrations in Fabry disease patient urine samples and controls. The processing of samples required only drying a homogeneous urine sample. Different supports (or sample substrates) were used: Teflon sheets, Whatman 903 filter paper, Urine Kid paper and glass slides. In order to establish the merits of the analytical method developed, matrix-matched synthetic laboratory standards spiked with analytes of interest were prepared at low concentrations (mu g L-1 level). The precision and accuracy of the analytical method were <20% (LA-ICP-MS) for trace metals in 1 mu L urine laboratory standards (at analyte concentrations of 300 ng mL(-1)). The limit of detection varied from 0.003 to 0.58 mu g g(-1) for lithium, boron, titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, arsenic, rubidium, strontium, molybdenum, silver, cadmium, barium, lead, and uranium. LA-ICP-MS allowed the quantification and comparison of different trace metals in urine samples from a Fabry disease patient and from a reference control individual.

TI Monitoring of Perfluorinated Compounds in Aquatic Biota: An Updated
   Review PFCs in Aquatic Biota
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The goal of this article is to summarize new biological monitoring information on perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in aquatic ecosystems (post-2005) as a followup to our critical review published in 2006. A wider range of geographical locations (e.g., South America, Russia, Antarctica) and habitats (e.g., high-mountain lakes, deep-ocean, and offshore waters) have been investigated in recent years enabling a better understanding of the global distribution of PFCs in aquatic organisms. High concentrations of PFCs continue to be detected in invertebrates, fish, reptiles, and marine mammals worldwide. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is still the predominant PFC detected (mean concentrations up to 1900 ng/g ww) in addition to important concentrations of long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs; sum PFCAs up to 400 ng/g ww). More studies have evaluated the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of these compounds in both freshwater and marine food webs. Several reports have indicated a decrease in PFOS levels over time in contrast to PFCA concentrations that have tended to increase in tissues of aquatic organisms at many locations. The detection of precursor metabolites and isomers has become more frequently reported in environmental assessments yielding important information on the sources and distribution of these contaminants. The integration of environmental/ecological characteristics (e.g., latitude/longitude, salinity, and/or trophic status at sampling locations) and biological variables (e.g., age, gender, life cycle, migration, diet composition, growth rate, food chain length, metabolism, and elimination) are essential elements in order to adequately study the environmental fate and distribution of PFCs and should be more frequently considered in study design.

SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB We present a critical review of the analytical procedures proposed in the past decade for the determination of fluoroquinolones (FQs) by chromatographic methods in solid environmental matrices. We emphasize the overall analytical procedure, from sampling to final detection. We devote special attention to sample preparation, highlighting the problems involved in the analysis of real complex matrices, mainly soil, sediment, manure and sludge. We compare the different extraction techniques in terms of efficiency, time taken and environmental impact, pointing out advantages and drawbacks. We provide an overview on the role of photochemistry in the degradation of FQs in soils and sediments, and we underline the central position of analytical chemistry in environmental monitoring because FQs are emerging pollutants.

TI Ultrasound-mediated tumor imaging and nanotherapy using drug loaded,
   block copolymer stabilized perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions
SO JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE
CT 8th International Nanomedicine and Drug Delivery Symposium (NanoDDS)
CY OCT 03-05, 2010
CL Omaha, NE
AB Perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions can deliver lipophilic therapeutic agents to solid tumors and simultaneously provide for monitoring nanocarrier biodistribution via ultrasonography and/or F-19 MRI. In the first generation of block copolymer stabilized perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions, perfluoropentane (PFP) was used as the droplet forming compound. Although manifesting excellent therapeutic and ultrasound imaging properties, PFP nanoemulsions were unstable at storage, difficult to handle, and underwent hard to control phenomenon of irreversible droplet-to-bubble transition upon injection. To solve the above problems, perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether (PFCE) was used as a core forming compound in the second generation of block copolymer stabilized perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions. PFCE nanodroplets manifest both ultrasound and fluorine (F-19) MR contrast properties, which allows using multimodal imaging and F-19 MR spectroscopy for monitoring nanodroplet pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. In the present paper, acoustic, imaging, and therapeutic properties of unloaded and paclitaxel (FIX) loaded PFCE nanoemulsions are reported. As manifested by the F-19 MR spectroscopy, PFCE nanodroplets are long circulating, with about 50% of the injected dose remaining in circulation 2 h after the systemic injection. Sonication with 1-MHz therapeutic ultrasound triggered reversible droplet-to-bubble transition in PFCE nanoemulsions. Microbubbles formed by acoustic vaporization of nanodroplets underwent stable cavitation. The nanodroplet size (200 nm to 350 nm depending on a type of the shell and conditions of emulsification) as well as long residence in circulation favored their passive accumulation in tumor tissue that was confirmed by ultrasonography. In the breast and pancreatic cancer animal models, ultrasound-mediated therapy with paclitaxel-loaded PFCE nanoemulsions showed excellent therapeutic properties characterized by tumor regression and suppression of metastasis. Anticipated mechanisms of the observed effects are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Vitreous Substitutes: A Comprehensive Review
SO SURVEY OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Vitreoretinal disorders constitute a significant portion of treatable ocular disease. Advances in vitreoretinal surgery have included the development and characterization of suitable substitutes for the vitreous. Air, balanced salt solutions, perfluorocarbons, expansile gases, and silicone oil serve integral roles in modern vitreoretinal surgery. Vitreous substitutes vary widely in their properties, serve different clinical functions, and present different shortcomings. Permanent vitreous replacement has been attempted with collagen, hyaluronic acid, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and natural hydrogel polymers. None, however, have proven to be clinically viable. A long-term vitreous substitute remains to be found, and recent research suggests promise in the area of synthetic polymers. Here we review the currently available vitreous substitutes, as well those in the experimental phase. We classify these compounds based on their functionality, composition, and properties. We also discuss the clinical use, advantages, and shortcomings of the various substitutes. In addition we define the ideal vitreous substitute and highlight the need for a permanent substitute with long-term viability and compatibility. Finally, we attempt to define the future role of biomaterials research and the various functions they may serve in the area of vitreous substitutes. (Surv Ophthalmol 56:300-323, 2011.

TI Biological Responses to Perfluorododecanoic Acid Exposure in Rat Kidneys
   as Determined by Integrated Proteomic and Metabonomic Studies
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background: Perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) is a perfluorinated carboxylic chemical (PFC) that has broad applications and distribution in the environment. While many studies have focused on hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity of PFCAs, few have investigated renal toxicity.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we used comparative proteomic and metabonomic technologies to provide a global perspective on renal response to PFDoA. Male rats were exposed to 0, 0.05, 0.2, and 0.5 mg/kg/day of PFDoA for 110 days. After 2-D DIGE and MALDI TOF/TOF analysis, 79 differentially expressed proteins between the control and the PFDoA treated rats (0.2 and 0.5 mg-dosed groups) were successfully identified. These proteins were mainly involved in amino acid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, electron transport, and stress response. Nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabonomic analysis showed an increase in pyruvate, lactate, acetate, choline, and a variety of amino acids in the highest dose group. Furthermore, the profiles of free amino acids in the PFDoA treated groups were investigated quantitatively by high-coverage quantitative iTRAQ-LC MS/MS, which showed levels of sarcosine, asparagine, histidine, 1-methylhistidine, Ile, Leu, Val, Trp, Tyr, Phe, Cys, and Met increased markedly in the 0.5 mg dosed group, while homocitrulline, alpha-aminoadipic acid, beta-alanine, and cystathionine decreased.
   Conclusion/Significance: These observations provide evidence that disorders in glucose and amino acid metabolism may contribute to PFDoA nephrotoxicity. Additionally, alpha(2u) globulin may play an important role in protecting the kidneys from PFDoA toxicity.

TI The Influence of Prosthesis Diameter in Stapes Surgery: A Meta-Analysis
   and Systematic Review of the Literature
SO OTOLOGY & NEUROTOLOGY
AB Objective: To analyze the influence of stapes prosthesis diameter on postoperative hearing results after stapedotomy without interposition in otosclerotic patients.
   Data Sources: PubMed search from 1970 to 2009 using the key words stapedotomy or stapedectomy or otosclerosis or stapesplasty.
   Study Selection: Inclusion criteria to select articles and patient groups for meta-analysis and statistical analyses were as follows: otosclerosis as diagnosis, clear description of technique and prosthesis size, calibrated stapedotomy, and complete report of functional results.
   Data Extraction: Five controlled studies were found analyzing the influence of prosthesis diameter and reporting the results in a comparable way for meta-analysis (n = 590). Sixty-two studies not analyzing the influence of prosthesis diameter contained comparable subgroups with a total of 9,536 cases. These cases were pooled according to their diameter (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.8 mm). The results of air conduction, bone conduction, air-bone gap (ABG), and success rate (closure of the ABG within 10 dB as percentage of the total cases) for all groups and frequency-specific ABG results were gathered. Furthermore, 12 clinical and experimental studies were reviewed that did not contribute to the statistical analysis.
   Data Synthesis: A meta-analysis performed for success rate of the 5 controlled studies showed favorable results for 0.6-mm over 0.4-mm prostheses (success rate, 67% versus 58%, p = 0.05). In the statistical analysis of the pooled data, the 0.6-mm prosthesis showed better results compared with 0.4 mm (p G 0.001) in the postoperative air conduction threshold (29 dB versus 35 dB), postoperative ABG (7 dB versus 11 dB), ABG improvement (25 dB versus 21 dB), and success rate (81.1% versus 75.1%). The frequency-specific analysis of the postoperative ABG showed no advantage for the small prosthesis in the high frequencies. There was no difference in postoperative change of bone conduction in the 0.6- and 0.4-mm groups. Statistically significant results could not be assessed for other prosthesis diameters because of the small number of cases reported.
   Conclusion: A 0.6-mm diameter piston prosthesis is associated with significantly better results than a 0.4-mm prosthesis and should be used if the surgical conditions allow it.

TI Conserved toxic responses across divergent phylogenetic lineages: a
   meta-analysis of the neurotoxic effects of RDX among multiple species
   using toxicogenomics
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY
AB At military training sites, a variety of pollutants such as hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), may contaminate the area originating from used munitions. Studies investigating the mechanism of toxicity of RDX have shown that it affects the central nervous system causing seizures in humans and animals. Environmental pollutants such as RDX have the potential to affect many different species, therefore it is important to establish how phylogenetically distant species may respond to these types of emerging pollutants. In this paper, we have used a transcriptional network approach to compare and contrast the neurotoxic effects of RDX among five phylogenetically disparate species: rat (Sprague-Dawley), Northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), earthworm (Eisenia fetida), and coral (Acropora formosa). Pathway enrichment analysis indicated a conservation of RDX impacts on pathways related to neuronal function in rat, Northern bobwhite quail, fathead minnows and earthworm, but not in coral. As evolutionary distance increased common responses decreased with impacts on energy and metabolism dominating effects in coral. A neurotransmission related transcriptional network based on whole rat brain responses to RDX exposure was used to identify functionally related modules of genes, components of which were conserved across species depending upon evolutionary distance. Overall, the meta-analysis using genomic data of the effects of RDX on several species suggested a common and conserved mode of action of the chemical throughout phylogenetically remote organisms.

TI Microchip based sample treatment device interfaced with ICP-MS for the
   analysis of transition metals from environmental samples
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB A downscaled solid phase (SPE) device applicable for sample preparation prior to ICP-MS monitoring, have been constructed making use of the lab on a chip concept. Standard photolithography and wet chemical etching were used to fabricate glass microfluidic devices accommodating three microchannels, each of them incorporating a defined section that could be packed with SPE materials; selective chelating resin. The microfluidic device was interfaced with the ICP-MS instrument throughout a low flow rate concentric nebuliser using a Teflon connector, and coupled with a flow injection manifold delivering samples and reagents via a manually operated splitting valve. The feasibility of the miniaturized prototype to perform SPE of trace metals was proved by analyzing trace metals, Cd, Co, and Ni, in seawater reference materials; CASS-2 and SLEW-1. The obtained result was in good agreement with the certified values. The device could be used as a remote miniaturized sample treatment for field work. (c) 2010 King Saud University.

TI Meta-analysis of short-term and long-term survival following repair
   versus replacement for ischemic mitral regurgitation
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY
AB The optimal surgical strategy for the management of ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is still debated. The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis summarizing the evidence favoring one technique over another (repair vs replacement). A search of the English literature in PubMed was performed using 'ischemic mitral regurgitation' and 'repair or replacement or annuloplasty' in the title/abstract field. Articles were excluded if they lacked a direct comparison of repair versus replacement, or used Teflon/pericardial strip or suture annuloplasty in >10% of the repairs. Nine articles were selected for the final analysis. All studies except one were relatively recent (2004-2009). The patient characteristics between treatment groups were similar across studies. All studies excluded patients with degenerative etiology and used a rigorous definition of IMR. Most patients had concomitant coronary artery bypass graft. In the patients with mitral valve replacement, at least the posterior and, in many cases, the entire subvalvular apparatus were preserved. Mean ejection fraction and proportion of patients with severe ventricular dysfunction were similar between the repair and replacement groups. The odds ratios for the studies, comparing replacement to repair, ranged from 0.884 to 17.241 for short-term mortality and the hazard ratios ranged from 0.677 to 3.205 for long-term mortality. There was a significantly increased likelihood of both short-term mortality (summary odds ratio 2.667 (95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.859-3.817)) and long-term mortality (summary hazard ratio 1.352 (95% CI 1.131-1.618)) for the replacement group compared to the repair group. Based on the meta-analysis of the current relevant literature, mitral valve repair for IMR is associated with better short-term and long-term survival compared to mitral valve replacement Our conclusion should be interpreted in the context of the inherent limitations of a meta-analysis of retrospective studies including heterogeneity of patient characteristics, which may have influenced the physician's decision to perform mitral valve repair or replacement. In the absence of any published randomized studies, mitral procedure selection should be individualized. (C) 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Meta-analysis of zooarchaeological data from SW Asia and SE Europe
   provides insight into the origins and spread of animal husbandry
SO JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE
AB Identifying spatial and temporal variation in animal exploitation patterns is essential for building our understanding of the transition from hunting to stock-keeping. Quantitative analysis of the published records of over 400,000 animal bones recovered from 114 archaeological sites from SW Asia and SE Europe from c12 ka to c7.5 ka cal BP (thousands of calibrated radiocarbon years before present) demonstrates significant spatiotemporal variability in faunal exploitation patterns. Sites in the Euphrates region show adoption of domestic taxa by c10.5 ka cal BP, although on average these taxa contribute less than 10% to total assemblage size. This rises to a median of about 40% by c9.5 ka cal BP, and then to about 45% of total NISP by c8.5 ka cal BP. By c10.5 ka in the Tigris and Zagros region domesticates contribute less than 5% to faunal assemblages, but then rise to a median of about 20% by c9.5 ka and 40% by c8.4 ka cal BR In contrast, Levantine sites have low numbers of domestic taxa (< 1%) until c8.8 ka cal BP, when the proportion dramatically increases to a median of about 35%. This apparent delayed-adoption pattern also holds true for the southern Levant, which shows, on average, low levels (< 1%) of domestic taxa until 8.8 ka cal BP, at which point domesticates contribute a median of about 10% to assemblages. In the northern parts of SW Asia, the mid- to late-10th millennium cal BP is pivotal, as proportions of domestic taxa show a dramatic increase in frequency during this time, and the 'package' of domestic sheep, goat, cattle and pig becomes more firmly established. This sets the trend for sites of the 9th millennium and the appearance of Neolithic communities in SE Europe from the 8th millennium cal BP onwards, from which point domestic animals are ubiquitous in faunal assemblages.

   hemodialysis
SO CLINICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Objectives: To develop a reliable HPLC method for the simultaneous determination of plasma tryptophan, kynurenine and 5-hydroxytryptamine to analyze tryptophan metabolism.
   Design and methods: Separation was carried out on a C8 column with the mobile phase composed of acetate buffer (pH 4.5) and acetonitrile using theophylline as internal standard. The eluates were monitored by ultraviolet detection with programmed wavelength.
   Results: Analysis was achieved in less than 8.0 min. The limits of quantification were 3.97 mu mol/L, 4.36 nmol/L and 0.421 mu mol/L for tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptamine and kynurenine, respectively. Reproducibility and recovery were satisfactory. Twenty healthy adults and 20 uremic patients undergoing hemodialysis were analyzed using the present method. Tryptophan metabolism was found to be disturbed in uremic patients and was improved obviously after hemodialysis.
   Conclusions: The developed HPLC method is simple, reliable and suitable for monitoring tryptophan metabolism in uremic patients undergoing hemodialysis. (C) 2010 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI A Meta-Analysis for Comparison of the Two-Layer and University of
   Wisconsin Pancreas Preservation Methods in Islet Transplantation
SO CELL TRANSPLANTATION
AB Conflicting results have been reported on the effectiveness of the two-layer method (TLM) compared with the University of Wisconsin (UW) method for preserving pancreata. The objective of this study was to compile the evidence for or against any difference in human islet yield and viability between these two. PubMed (January 2000 to May 2008) and Cochran Library searches were performed and 17 studies were included for the meta-analysis. Data on donor characteristics, preservation time, and outcomes were abstracted. Studies were subgrouped based on how TLM was used (UW + TLM or TLM alone), on mean cold ischemic time (CIT) (>20 h or <20 h), and on whether special chemical was used (yes or no). Meta-analysis of all studies and subgroups was performed and the pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were. reported. Overall, the use of TLM significantly increased islet yield [SMD, 0.74 (0.44-1.04)] and viability [SMD, 0.63 (0.14-1.12)]. The beneficial effects of TLM on islet yield were more evident when TLM was used following UW storage or when prolonged CIT was used. TLM used alone, shorter CIT, and no chemical use all resulted in similar islet viability between TLM and UW groups. Beneficial effects of TLM on islet viability were demonstrated only when TLM was used following UW storage, or with prolonged CIT, or with chemical use. In conclusion, the TLM was beneficial for prolonged pancreas preservation before human islet isolation; however, benefit of the TLM for short-term preservation was not clear.

TI Design and properties of functional hybrid organic-inorganic membranes
   for fuel cells
SO CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
AB This critical review presents a discussion on the major advances in the field of organic-inorganic hybrid membranes for fuel cells application. The hybrid organic-inorganic approach, when the organic part is not conductive, reproduces to some extent the behavior of Nafion where discrete hydrophilic and hydrophilic domains are homogeneously distributed. A large variety of proton conducting or non conducting polymers can be combined with various functionalized, inorganic mesostructured particles or an inorganic network in order to achieve high proton conductivity, and good mechanical and chemical properties. The tuning of the interface between these two components and the control over chemical and processing conditions are the key parameters in fabricating these hybrid organic-inorganic membranes with a high degree of reproducibility. This dynamic coupling between chemistry and processing requires the extensive use and development of complementary ex situ measurements with in situ characterization techniques, following in real time the molecular precursor solutions to the formation of the final hybrid organic-inorganic membranes. These membranes combine the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of both the inorganic and organic components. The development of the sol-gel chemistry allows a fine tuning of the inorganic network, which exhibits acid-based functionalized pores (-SO3H, -PO3H2, -COOH), tunable pore size and connectivity, high surface area and accessibility. As such, these hybrid membranes containing inorganic materials are a promising family for controlling conductivity, mechanical and chemical properties (349 references).

TI Pyrene-functionalized oligonucleotides and locked nucleic acids (LNAs):
   Tools for fundamental research, diagnostics, and nanotechnology
SO CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
AB Pyrene-functionalized oligonucleotides (PFOs) are increasingly explored as tools in fundamental research, diagnostics and nanotechnology. Their popularity is linked to the ability of pyrenes to function as polarity-sensitive and quenchable fluorophores, excimer-generating units, aromatic stacking moieties and nucleic acid duplex intercalators. These characteristics have enabled development of PFOs for detection of complementary DNA/RNA targets, discrimination of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and generation of pi-arrays on nucleic acid scaffolds. This critical review will highlight the physical properties and applications of PFOs that are likely to provide high degree of positional control of the chromophore in nucleic acid complexes. Particular emphasis will be placed on pyrene-functionalized Locked Nucleic Acids (LNAs) since these materials display interesting properties such as fluorescence quantum yields approaching unity and recognition of mixed-sequence double stranded DNA (144 references).

TI Perfluorinated Compounds in Food: A Global Perspective
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION
AB Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are resistant to breakdown and are turning up in unexpected places around the world, becoming emerging food contaminants. Although these chemicals have been used in countless products since the 1950s, they have been subject to little control until now. There is still an insufficient knowledge of their sources, occurrence, and hazards for food safety decision making. This article provides a comprehensive review of the food contamination levels and dietary intake risks posed by PFCs, as well as the specific methods developed for their determination. It is based on the evaluation of the published literature between 2004 and the beginning of 2010, with special emphasis on those reports of the last two years and in the examination of the growing body of studies on the exposure assessment and food occurrence of PFCs. The current state-of-the art and future perspectives in extraction, clean-up, detection, identification, confirmation, and quantification highlighting the advantages and limitations of each technique have been summarized. How much is known about the sources and pathways of food web and human exposure, which is needed to control and manage the release of these emerging toxic contaminants, has also been explained.

TI NITRIC OXIDE SIGNALING AS A COMMON TARGET OF ORGANOHALOGENS AND OTHER
   NEUROENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS
SO JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART B-CRITICAL REVIEWS
AB Organohalogen compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) are global environmental pollutants and highly persistent, bioaccumulative chemicals that produce adverse effects in humans and wildlife. Because of the widespread use of these organohalogens in household items and consumer products, indoor contamination is a significant source of human exposure, especially for children. One significant concern with regard to health effects associated with exposure to organohalogens is endocrine disruption. Toxicological studies on organohalogen pollutants primarily focused on sex steroid and thyroid hormone actions, and findings have largely shaped the way one envisions their disruptive effects occurring. Organohalogens exert additional effects on other systems including other complex endocrine systems that may be disregulated at various levels of organization. Over the last 20 years evidence has mounted in favor of a critical role of nitric oxide (NO) in numerous functions ranging from neuroendocrine functions to learning and memory. With its participation in multiple systems and action at several levels of integration, NO signaling has a pervasive influence on nervous and endocrine functions. Like blockers of NO synthesis, PCBs and PBDEs produce multifaceted effects on physiological systems. Based on this unique set of converging information it is proposed that organohalogen actions occur, in part, by hijacking processes associated with this ubiquitous bioactive molecule. The current review examines the emerging evidence for NO involvement in selected organohalogen actions and includes recent progress from our laboratory that adds to our current understanding of the actions of organohalogens within hypothalamic neuroendocrine circuits. The thyroid, vasopressin, and reproductive systems as well as processes associated with long-term potentiation were selected as sample targets of organohalogens that rely on regulation by NO. Information is provided about other toxicants with demonstrated interference of NO signaling. Our focus on the convergence between NO system and organohalogen toxicity offers a novel approach to understanding endocrine and neuroendocrine disruption that is particularly problematic for developing organisms. This new working model is proposed as a way to encourage future study in elucidating common mechanisms of action that are selected with a better operational understanding of the systems affected.

TI Decarboxylative Coupling Reactions
SO ISRAEL JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Decarboxylative couplings are chemical transformations in which carboxylic acids extrude CO, and form new bonds in the place of the former carboxylate group. In recent years, a large number of such reactions with considerable synthetic potential has been developed. This article reviews the rapidly emerging area of decarboxylative couplings. A focus is set on redox-neutral cross-couplings, a novel concept for carbon-carbon bond formation that was developed in our group.

TI Detection of Metal Ions Based on Conjugated Fluorescent Polymers
SO PROGRESS IN CHEMISTRY
AB Conjugated fluorescent polymers (CPs) such as polyacetylene, polyfluorene, polythiophene and polyphenylene derivatives have unique optical properties, self-assembly performance and regulable structure and properties. They have been used as excellent optical sensing materials to develop high sensitive and selective sensors by utilizing the large extinction coefficient and high fluorescence quantum yield of conjugated polymers, which have been a research hot spot in the field of biosensors. Detection of metal ions based on the conjugated polymer primarily relies on the non-water-soluble conjugated polymers. Metal ions can be detected by investigating the changes of the optical characteristics of the polymers induced by the combination of metal ions with some units such as bipyridyl and crown ethers on the polymer chains. Water solubility of conjugated polymers can be improved by appending hydrophilic side chains on the main chain of polymer, which provide many new ideas for the design of metal ions biosensors. For example, some biomolecules such as DNA and glucopyranose can be used to design schemes in order to improve the sensitivity and selectivity for the detection of metal ions. This review summarizes the recent progress of highly sensitive detection of heavy metal ions (Hg2+, Pb2+), transition-metal ions (Cu2+, Ni2+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Ru3+, Ag+), rare earth element ion (Eu3+), and alkali metal ions (K+, Na+, Li+) based on non-water-soluble and water-soluble conjugated fluorescent polymers. The development prospects of the field is presented.

TI Microbial biodegradation of a novel fluorotelomer alcohol,
   1H,1H,2H,2H,8H,8H-perfluorododecanol, yields short fluorinated acids
SO APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB The accumulation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been detected in wildlife, soil, and water. Further, 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (8:2 FTOH) is used for the industrial synthesis of other fluorotelomer compounds, surfactants, and polymeric materials; however, it was recently found to be a potential source of PFOA contamination in the environment. 1H,1H,2H,2H,8H,8H-perfluorododecanol (degradable telomer fluoroalcohol (DTFA)), which is a newly developed fluorotelomer, contains the -CH(2)- group in the fluorinated carbon backbone, making it potentially degradable through biological reactions. In this study, we investigated the biodegradation of DTFA in a mixed bacterial culture obtained from activated sludge. Optimized quantitative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the predicted metabolites generated in the culture revealed accumulations of the transformation products from DTFA to 2H,2H,8H,8H-PFDoA and 2H,8H,8H-2-PFUDoA via multiple processes. Furthermore, the production of short fluorinated compounds, perfluorobutanoic acid, perfluoropentanoic acid, and perfluoropentanedioic acid, which are believed to have lower accumulation potential and toxicity toward organisms than PFOA, was determined.

TI A global review of polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardant
   contamination in birds
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB As a consequence of substantial, long-term usage, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have contaminated humans, wildlife, and abiotic matrices around the world. Although several reports have reviewed PBDE contamination in general, none have focused specifically on birds. Birds have long been recognized as invaluable monitoring species for organohalogen contamination. This review summarizes most available PBDE data in birds and emphasizes several specific aspects, i.e., inter-regional differences in PBDE contamination, the extent of BDE-209 contamination, differences in congener composition patterns between piscivorous and terrestrial-feeding birds, trophic biomagnification and temporal changes in PBDE contamination. A meta-analysis of PBDE congener profiles reveals distinctly different patterns between birds utilizing terrestrial and aquatic food webs. Terrestrial-feeding birds appear to exhibit heightened Deca-BDE contamination. Inter-regional comparisons reveal elevated PBDE burdens in North American aquatic birds compared to those from the rest of the world, likely related to greater Penta-BDE demand there. Examination of North American and Chinese terrestrial birds also exhibited some of the highest BDE-209 concentrations ever reported in wildlife, and suggested that urban environments in general and some commercial activities (e.g., electronic recycling) may increase exposure of wildlife and humans to Deca-BDE. Summaries of temporal trend studies suggest that varying usage histories and regulations have influenced PBDE contamination patterns at different regions. As a consequence of continued usage of Deca-BDE around the world, significant increases in BDE-209 burdens have been observed in both North American and European birds. Examination of both wild and laboratory-exposed birds also indicated potential degradation of BDE-209 to less brominated, but more bioavailable/toxic congeners. Therefore, it would be wise to reduce releases of Deca-BDE, the only PBDE formulation remaining in production, to the environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Anterior knee pain in younger adults as a precursor to subsequent
   patellofemoral osteoarthritis: a systematic review
SO BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS
AB Background: Patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) is a common form of knee OA in middle and older age, but its relation to PF disorders and symptoms earlier in life is unclear. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review to investigate the strength of evidence for an association between anterior knee pain (AKP) in younger adults and subsequent PFOA.
   Methods: The search strategy included electronic databases (Pubmed, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane, PEDro, SportDiscus: inception to December 2009), reference lists of potentially eligible studies and selected reviews. Full text articles in any language, -identified via English titles and abstracts, were included if they were retrospective or prospective in design and contained quantitative data regarding structural changes indicative of PFOA, incident to original idiopathic AKP. Eligibility criteria were applied to titles, abstracts and full-texts by two independent reviewers. Data extraction included study location, design, date, sampling procedure, sample characteristics, AKP/PFOA definitions, follow-up duration and rate, and main findings. Foreign language articles were translated into English prior to examination.
   Results: Seven articles satisfied eligibility (5 English, 2 German). Only one case-control study directly investigated a link between PFOA and prior AKP, providing level 3b evidence in favour of an association (OR 4.4; 95%Cl 1.8, 10.6). Rough estimates of the annual risk of PFOA from the remaining six small, uncontrolled, observational studies (mean follow-up range: 5.7 to 23 years) ranged from 0% to 3.4%. This was not the primary aim of these studies, and limitations in design and methodology mean this data should be interpreted with caution.
   Conclusions: There is a paucity of high-quality evidence reporting a link between AKP and PFOA. Further, well-designed cohort studies may be able to fill this evidence gap.

TI Global regulation of gene expression in response to cysteine
   availability in Clostridium perfringens
SO BMC MICROBIOLOGY
AB Background: Cysteine has a crucial role in cellular physiology and its synthesis is tightly controlled due to its reactivity. However, little is known about the sulfur metabolism and its regulation in clostridia compared with other firmicutes. In Clostridium perfringens, the two-component system, VirR/VirS, controls the expression of the ubiG operon involved in methionine to cysteine conversion in addition to the expression of several toxin genes. The existence of links between the C. perfringens virulence regulon and sulfur metabolism prompted us to analyze this metabolism in more detail.
   Results: We first performed a tentative reconstruction of sulfur metabolism in C. perfringens and correlated these data with the growth of strain 13 in the presence of various sulfur sources. Surprisingly, C. perfringens can convert cysteine to methionine by an atypical still uncharacterized pathway. We further compared the expression profiles of strain 13 after growth in the presence of cystine or homocysteine that corresponds to conditions of cysteine depletion. Among the 177 genes differentially expressed, we found genes involved in sulfur metabolism and controlled by premature termination of transcription via a cysteine specific T-box system (cysK-cysE, cysP1 and cysP2) or an S-box riboswitch (metK and metT). We also showed that the ubiG operon was submitted to a triple regulation by cysteine availability via a T-box system, by the VirR/VirS system via the VR-RNA and by the VirX regulatory RNA. In addition, we found that expression of pfoA (theta-toxin), nagL (one of the five genes encoding hyaluronidases) and genes involved in the maintenance of cell redox status was differentially expressed in response to cysteine availability. Finally, we showed that the expression of genes involved in [Fe-S] clusters biogenesis and of the ldh gene encoding the lactate dehydrogenase was induced during cysteine limitation.
   Conclusion: Several key functions for the cellular physiology of this anaerobic bacterium were controlled in response to cysteine availability. While most of the genes involved in sulfur metabolism are regulated by premature termination of transcription, other still uncharacterized mechanisms of regulation participated in the induction of gene expression during cysteine starvation.

TI Meta-analysis of cotton fiber quality QTLs across diverse environments
   in a Gossypium hirsutum x G. barbadense RIL population
SO BMC PLANT BIOLOGY
AB Background: Cotton fibers (produced by Gossypium species) are the premier natural fibers for textile production. The two tetraploid species, G. barbadense (Gb) and G. hirsutum (Gh), differ significantly in their fiber properties, the former having much longer, finer and stronger fibers that are highly prized. A better understanding of the genetics and underlying biological causes of these differences will aid further improvement of cotton quality through breeding and biotechnology. We evaluated an inter-specific Gh x Gb recombinant inbred line (RIL) population for fiber characteristics in 11 independent experiments under field and glasshouse conditions. Sites were located on 4 continents and 5 countries and some locations were analyzed over multiple years.
   Results: The RIL population displayed a large variability for all major fiber traits. QTL analyses were performed on a persite basis by composite interval mapping. Among the 651 putative QTLs (LOD > 2), 167 had a LOD exceeding permutation based thresholds. Coincidence in QTL location across data sets was assessed for the fiber trait categories strength, elongation, length, length uniformity, fineness/maturity, and color. A meta-analysis of more than a thousand putative QTLs was conducted with MetaQTL software to integrate QTL data from the RIL and 3 backcross populations (from the same parents) and to compare them with the literature. Although the global level of congruence across experiments and populations was generally moderate, the QTL clustering was possible for 30 trait x chromosome combinations (5 traits in 19 different chromosomes) where an effective co-localization of unidirectional (similar sign of additivity) QTLs from at least 5 different data sets was observed. Most consistent meta-clusters were identified for fiber color on chromosomes c6, c8 and c25, fineness on c15, and fiber length on c3.
   Conclusions: Meta-analysis provided a reliable means of integrating phenotypic and genetic mapping data across multiple populations and environments for complex fiber traits. The consistent chromosomal regions contributing to fiber quality traits constitute good candidates for the further dissection of the genetic and genomic factors underlying important fiber characteristics, and for marker-assisted selection.

TI A Review of the Empirical Evidence on Generational Differences in Work
   Attitudes
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY
AB This article reviews the evidence for generational differences in work values from time-lag studies (which can separate generation from age/career stage) and cross-sectional studies (which cannot). Understanding generational shifts is especially important given the coming retirement of Baby Boomer workers and their replacement by those born after 1982 (GenMe/GenY/Millennials).
   Most studies, including the few time-lag studies, show that GenX and especially GenMe rate work as less central to their lives, value leisure more, and express a weaker work ethic than Boomers and Silents. Extrinsic work values (e.g., salary) are higher in GenMe and especially GenX. Contrary to popular conceptions, there were no generational differences in altruistic values (e.g., wanting to help others). Conflicting results appeared in desire for job stability, intrinsic values (e.g., meaning), and social/affiliative values (e.g., making friends). GenX, and especially GenMe are consistently higher in individualistic traits. Overall, generational differences are important where they appear, as even small changes at the average mean that twice or three times as many individuals score at the top of the distribution.
   To recruit GenMe, companies should focus on work-life balance issues and flexible schedules. Programs based on volunteering, altruistic values, social values, or meaning in work will likely be no more successful than they were for previous generations. The lack of generational differences in job hopping suggests that GenMe workers who are satisfied will be retained.
   No previous review has summarized all of the available studies examining generational differences in work values.

TI Black Carbon determination in particulate matter deposited on standard
   Teflon filters

CY SEP 28-OCT 03, 2009

SP Italian Phys Soc
AB Elemental Carbon (EC) is an important component of Particulate Matter (PM) and, when determined by optical method, it is usually referred as Black Carbon (BC). Teflon (PTFE (R)) membranes are very appropriate for gravimetric and compositional analyses of PM and 47 mm filters with 2 mu m pores are very often used to collect PM samples on daily basis. We describe here a simple, non-destructive, optical method to measure, on the PTFE filters routinely used for PM studies, the BC content basically without any sizeable extra-cost. This gives the opportunity to measure in each sample the concentration of: total PM by gravimetric analysis, metals by, for instance, X-Ray Fluorescence, major ions by Ion Chromatography and BC. All these pieces of information can therefore be obtained with just one filter and with the sureness to analyze the same PM. Time series of such data are the basic input to source apportionment methods by receptor models. Furthermore, this approach also allows the analysis of particular samples as those collected by multi-stage cascade impactors and thus it provides information on the BC size distribution.

TI The Impact of Disclosing Financial Ties in Research and Clinical Care A
   Systematic Review
SO ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB Background: Despite increased demand for disclosure of physician and researcher financial ties (FTs) to industry, little is known about patients', research participants', or journal readers' attitudes toward FTs.
   Methods: We systematically reviewed original, quantitative studies of patients', research participants', or journal readers' views about FTs to pharmaceutical and medical device companies. The MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge databases were searched for English-language studies containing original, quantitative data on attitudes toward FTs. We screened 6561 citations and retrieved 244 potentially eligible abstracts. Of these, 20 met inclusion criteria.
   Results: Eleven studies assessed FTs and perceptions of quality. In clinical care, patients believed FTs decreased the quality and increased the cost of care. In research, FTs affected perceptions of study quality. In 2 studies, readers' perceptions of journal article quality decreased after disclosure of FTs. Eight studies assessed the acceptability of FTs. Patients were more likely to view personal gifts to physicians as unacceptable, compared with professional gifts. In 6 of the 10 studies that assessed the importance of disclosure, most patients and research participants believed FTs should be disclosed; in the other 4, approximately one-quarter believed FTs should be disclosed. Among the 7 studies assessing willingness to participate in research, approximately one-quarter of participants reported less willingness after disclosure of FTs.
   Conclusions: Patients believe that FTs influence professional behavior and should be disclosed. Patients, physicians, and research participants believe FTs decrease the quality of research evidence, and, for some, knowledge of FTs would affect willingness to participate in research.

TI Molecular Design of Polymeric Electroluminescent Materials
SO PROGRESS IN CHEMISTRY
AB Polymer light-emitting diode (PLED) materials have attracted great attention and research interests due to their great scientific and economic potentials for flat panel display, lighting, etc. The in-depth research and the development of new materials make the practical applications of PLED appealing. The molecular design of desired polymeric electroluminescent materials is the key in the PLED development. In this review, we systematically summarize the basic methods and theories of molecular design of PLED materials, from the single molecule to the aggregated states, primarily based on our previous studies. In the single molecule design, various methods and theories are introduced and discussed in detail. While in the aggregated state design, brief discussions are presented due to the complexity and rapid development of this aspect. Finally, a general method for the molecular design of PLED materials is suggested on the expectation of their future developments.

TI Dioxins and organohalogen contaminants in the Asia-Pacific region
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY
AB This article reviews the outcome of comprehensive investigations conducted in our laboratory at CMES, Ehime University over the past three decades on the distribution, sources, temporal trends and toxic impacts of the persistent and bioaccumulative organohalogen contaminants in Asia-Pacific region with a particular emphasis on developing countries. Results of multi-media monitoring studies were compiled and discussed to provide in-depth understanding on various issues of dioxins and organohalogen contamination in both ambient environment and animals including humans. Prominent contaminations were found in the regions where they have been heavily used. The eastern Asian region is probably a potential source of pollution, particularly by the new contaminants such as polybrominated diphenyls ethers. These groups of contaminants, together with polychlorinated biphenyls, exhibited either decreasing or increasing trends depending on the extent of industrialization in Asian developing region, indicating the necessity for long term monitoring. The open dumping sites for municipal wastes in major cities are significant sources of many toxic chemicals, and these areas are probably one of the challenges for future research due to the long term impacts on the environmental quality and human health. The formation of dioxins and related compounds in such dumping sites and their elevated residues found in breast milk of residents living in and around warrant long term impacts of dioxins upon next generations. Comprehensive and long term monitoring programs are urgently needed with close collaboration and proper capacity building in Asian developing countries in order to mitigate dioxin and organohalogen emission and their risk on ecosystems and human health.

TI Pollution by psychoactive pharmaceuticals in the Rivers of Madrid
   metropolitan area (Spain)
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB There are a number of reports in the literature which describe the occurrence of so-called emerging pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, in surface water. Few of these studies have reported values fro m large cities in relatively and areas, such as in Spain. The persistence of some pharmaceuticals to usual wastewater treatments allows their discharge into surface waters. It is increasingly evident that mental health problems are of special concern for public health since psychiatric drugs are used in large amounts. Compared to other countries, Spain has a high pharmaceutical consumption rate, and Madrid metropolitan area is one of the most densely populated areas in Europe. The aim of the present study was to determine the presence of different psychoactive pharmaceuticals and metabolites in the main rivers of Madrid metropolitan area: Jarama, Manzanares, Guadarrama, Henares and Tajo. Sampling was done downstream of ten sewage treatment plants (STP) discharging into these rivers. Control points upstream of STPs discharge points were also sampled. Pharmaceutical compounds and metabolites for analysis were selected according to human consumption and prescription rates in Madrid, and the availability of valid techniques for detection. We observed residues of the antidepressants fluoxetine (80% of the sampling sites), citalopram (60%) and venlafaxine (100%). the anxiolytics nordiazepam (90%). oxazepam (80%) and 7-aminoflunitrazepam (10%) and the anticonvulsant carabamazepine (70%). Measured concentrations equalled or exceeded those reported for other geographical areas, although there is a pronounced lack of information for the anxiolytics and venlafaxine. This is of special concern given that Wyeth-Ayerst's venlafaxine, Effexor, was the 10th greatest selling pharmaceutical worldwide in 2006. We conclude that the origin of pharmaceutical pollution in the rivers of Madrid is mainly the discharge of sewage treatment plants in Madrid's metropolitan area and a comprehensive monitoring program should be implemented.

TI Asymmetric synthesis of fluorine-containing amines, amino alcohols,
   alpha- and beta-amino acids mediated by chiral sulfinyl group
SO JOURNAL OF FLUORINE CHEMISTRY
AB This review article provides a critical overview of several different synthetic approaches developed for asymmetric preparation of fluorine-containing amines, amino alcohols, alpha- and beta-amino acids. The common feature of these methods is the application of sulfinyl group as a chiral auxiliary to control the stereochemical outcome of the reactions under study. In particular, the following general methods are critically discussed: diastereoselective methylene transfer from diazomethane to the carbonyl of beta-keto-gamma-fluoroalkyl sulfoxides as a general approach for preparation of various alpha-fluoroalkyl alpha-sulfinylalkyl oxiranes. The resulting compounds were used as true chiral synthons for their further elaboration via oxidative or reductive desulfurization, to numerous fluorine-containing and biologically relevant amino- and hydroxy-containing derivatives. Another general approaches discussed here are asymmetric additions to C=N double bond. One of them is addition of chiral sulfoxide stabilized carbon nucleophiles to fluorine-containing imines, leading to convenient preparation of alpha-fluoroalkyl derivatives of alpha amino acids and amines. Another approach is asymmetric Reformatsky reaction between N-sulfinyl imines and ethyl bromodifluoroacetate allowing operationally convenient preparation of alpha,alpha-difluoro-beta-amino acids in enantiomerically pure form. Finally, structurally similar but mechanistically different addition reactions of diethyl difluoromethylphosphonate to N-sulfinyl imines, as a general approach to asymmetric synthesis of alpha,alpha-difluoro-beta-aminophosphonates and phosphonic acids, are discussed. Effect of fluorine on the mechanism and stereochemical outcome of these reactions is discussed in detail and compared, where it is possible, with that of the analogous reactions of fluorine-free substrates.

TI Supramolecular 1D assemblies of polyfluorinated arylenediamines and
   18-crown-6
SO RUSSIAN CHEMICAL BULLETIN
AB Rods (1D assemblies) formed by alternate crown ether and arylenediamine molecules are the motif of the supramolecular architecture of crystals of molecular associates of 18-crown-6 with tetrafluoro-1,4- and -1,3-phenylenediamines, hexafluoro-2,6- and -2,7-naphthylenediamines. Molecules in the assemblies are arranged via H-bond predominantly between the crown ether oxygen atoms and the polyfluoroarene amino group hydrogen atoms. Influence of the amino groups mutual arrangement and the aromatic framework size on the crystal supramolecular architecture is characterized. Specific melting heats of the crystalline 1D assemblies of para- and pseudo-para-arylenediamines are higher than those of meta- and pseudo-meta-analogs; the associates having higher melting heats selectively crystallize from solutions of isomeric phenylene- or naphthylenediamine mixtures.

AB Since the 1988 U.S. ban on ocean dumping of sewage sludge, the majority of these materials are disposed of on land as biosolids. To provide fundamental data for risk assessment concerning the environment, crop plants, and humans, several studies have been conducted that aimed at quantifying the load of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as well as other emerging pollutants of concern in biosolids. So far, two large studies exist that analyzed biosolids samples representing the whole U.S. Both sample sets were collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and analyzed by the same contract laboratory that developed the EPA method 1694 for analysis of PPCPs in biosolids and other matrices. The samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and quantified using isotope dilution as well as conventional use of internal and external standards. The present meta analysis scrutinizes the findings and approaches of the two studies and puts them in context to potential environmental risks that should be considered.
   Both the EPA's Targeted National Sewage Sludge Survey (TNSSS) and the analysis of a comparable sample set collected in 2001 revealed concentrations of several antimicrobials and antibiotics in the mg kg(-1) dry weight range. Prevalent contaminants were triclocarban, triclosan, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, followed by a number of tetracycline antibiotics.
   A comparison of the two datasets and study designs showed that combining a large number of individual samples to mega-composite samples is a suitable approach for identifying prevalent contaminants and for obtaining representative mean concentrations. Whereas the use of mega composite samples can result in significant time and cost savings, this study design strategy tends to yield lower numbers of total analytes detected, lower detection frequencies for individual analytes and it limits the detection of spatial (geographical) patterns in analyte occurrence.
   The findings of both nationwide studies provide a critical data basis for future risk assessment concerning the safety of biosolids application on agricultural and recreational land. Risks of primary concern identified in this work are the promotion of antibiotic resistance in the environment, adverse effects on soil microbial communities and plants, as well as the possibility of direct exposure of consumers to antibiotic residues contained in food crops grown on biosolids amended fields.

TI Debrominated and methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ether metabolites
   in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) after exposure to
   decabromodiphenyl ether
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE209) is the primary component in a commonly used flame retardant. Previous studies had proved that BDE209 itself was not toxic, while its metabolites including debrominated diphenyl ethers (De-BDEs) and methoxylated brominated diphenyl ethers (MeO-BDEs) posed a potential threat to organisms. Many studies had indicated that BDE209 could metabolize quickly in mammals, but lacking in the basic data about the metabolism of BDE209 in fish. In the present study, two replicate treatment groups of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to BDE209 via a single intraperitoneal injection approximately 100 and 500 ng/g, respectively. Muscle, liver and blood samples were collected to analyze the specific metabolites on day 1 and day 28 post injection. The highest concentration of BDE209 was detected in muscle tissues, from 796.1 ng/g wet weight (day 1) to 687.1 ng/g wet weight (day 28) in high dose group, suggesting that BDE209 could accumulate slightly in muscle tissues. However, BDE209 was not detected in the blood for all treatments. Most congeners of De-BDEs were found in muscle and liver tissues, with the highest concentration in the liver. The main De-BDEs were nona-, octa-, hepta- and penta-De-BDEs. A total of seven MeO-BDE metabolites were observed among different fish tissues. Blood had the highest contribution of the MeO-BDE metabolites. Each MeO-BDE congener increased over the 28 days. These results in contrast to other studies suggested possible species-specific differences in metabolic abilities.

TI Methodological considerations in the development of HPLC-MS methods for
   the analysis of rodent plasma for metabonomic studies
SO MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS
AB A study of the factors involved in obtaining valid global metabolite profiles from the HPLC-MS of rat or mouse plasma for the purposes of metabonomic analysis has been undertaken. Plasma proteins were precipitated with three volumes of either methanol or acetonitrile. Chromatographic separations were performed on a C18-bonded stationary phase using 3.5 and 5 mu m particles packed into 2.1 and 4.6 mm i.d. formats, respectively, and on a C8 phase using 3.5 mm particles and a 2.1 mm i.d. column. Three reversed-phase gradient solvent systems, based on acidified water-acetonitrile, acidified water-methanol and acidified water-methanol-acetonitrile mixtures, were investigated. The column eluent was analysed with both positive and negative electrospray ionisation using a quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer. These studies revealed that while accurate classification of sample type can be made, there are a number of methodological problems associated with the analysis of plasma with respect to factors such as repeatability and column longevity. In particular, special care has to be taken to ensure that the analytical system is properly "conditioned'' by the repeated injection of matrix samples. The use of biological quality control (QC) samples provided an important means of monitoring method performance. Finally, the source of the plasma (Zucker wild-type or (fa/fa) rat or mouse tumour model) also appeared to have an effect on the repeatability of the methodology.

TI Characterization of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor
   alpha-Independent Effects of PPAR alpha Activators in the Rodent Liver:
   Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate also Activates the Constitutive-Activated
   Receptor
SO TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Peroxisome proliferator chemicals (PPC) are thought to mediate their effects in rodents on hepatocyte growth and liver cancer through the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha. Recent studies indicate that the plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) increased the incidence of liver tumors in PPAR alpha-null mice. We hypothesized that some PPC, including DEHP, induce transcriptional changes independent of PPAR alpha but dependent on other nuclear receptors, including the constitutive-activated receptor (CAR) that mediates phenobarbital (PB) effects on hepatocyte growth and liver tumor induction. To determine the potential role of CAR in mediating effects of PPC, a meta-analysis was performed on transcript profiles from published studies in which rats and mice were exposed to PPC and compared the profiles to those produced by exposure to PB. Valproic acid, clofibrate, and DEHP in rat liver and DEHP in mouse liver induced genes, including Cyp2b family members that are known to be regulated by CAR. Examination of transcript changes by Affymetrix ST 1.0 arrays and reverse transcription-PCR in the livers of DEHP-treated wild-type, PPAR alpha-null, and CAR-null mice demonstrated that (1) most (similar to 94%) of the transcriptional changes induced by DEHP were PPAR alpha-dependent, (2) many PPAR alpha-independent genes overlapped with those regulated by PB, (3) induction of genes Cyp2b10, Cyp3a11, and metallothionine-1 by DEHP was CAR dependent but PPAR alpha-independent, and (4) induction of a number of genes (Cyp8b1, Gstm4, and Gstm7) was independent of both CAR and PPAR alpha. Our results indicate that exposure to PPAR alpha activators including DEHP leads to activation of multiple nuclear receptors in the rodent liver.

TI Simultaneous analysis of diazepam and its metabolites in rat plasma and
   brain tissue by HPLC-UV and SPE
SO TALANTA
AB Diazepam is frequently used as an adjuvant during antidepressant therapy. Recently, some studies have suggested that the treatment with benzodiazepines could have different efficacy in depressed patients as opposed to non-depressed ones. To clarify the matter, a study is currently underway, regarding the drug metabolism in rats. In order to obtain a more complete and significant set of data, the main diazepam metabolites have also been considered, namely: nordiazepam, temazepam and oxazepam. A feasible and reliable HPLC method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of these compounds in plasma and brain tissue of rats. The method has been applied to "normal" rats and to genetic rat models of depression in order to estimate drug metabolism in different breeds. Analyte separation was achieved on a C8 reversed phase column using an acidic phosphate buffer/acetonitrile mixture as the mobile phase. The detection wavelength was 238 nm. An original sample pre-treatment, based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) was developed in order to eliminate endogenous interference, using only 250 mu L of matrix (brain homogenate or plasma) for a complete analysis. The method has been validated with good results in terms of precision, extraction yield, sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy on both matrices and has been successfully applied to samples from some rats subjected to the preliminary study. The obtained data will hopefully contribute to the clarification of possible differences between depressed and non-depressed subjects with respect to benzodiazepine biotransformation.

TI Recent Progress on Nafion-Based Nanocomposite Membranes for Fuel Cell
   Applications
SO MACROMOLECULAR MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have attracted tremendous attention because of their high efficiency compared to other types of fuel cells. Nafion is the most commonly used polymer for membranes used in PEMFCs. A large variety of nanoparticles of different natures and sizes can be blended with a Nafion matrix, generating a new class of nanostructured electrolyte membrane with interesting physical properties. In this paper, we discuss the recent progress in the field of Nafion-based nanocomposite membranes. They exhibit a significant improvement in thermomechanical and thermal stability as well as proton conductivity at very low filler contents. The preparation, characterization, and properties of various types of Nafion-based nanocomposite membranes are critically reviewed, and detailed examples are summarized.

AB The aim of this work was to determine the content of selected heavy metals in flax materials depending on the stage of fiber manufacturing. Non-treated natural fiber composition was compared with that of fibers processed. Changes in the composition of yarn before and after the following scutching, hackling, washing, and bleaching were also investigated. Analysis of heavy metals was performed applying inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Flax material was mineralized in closed Teflon vials with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid which were then placed in a microwave oven system. Analytical quality of the obtained results was checked by the determination of elements in the Certificate Reference Materials of IAEA-V-10. The acquired results proved that the content of metals in flax clearly varies depending on the treatment process applied (bleaching, washing, coloration). Significant differences were also connected with the dye used.

TI Environmental chemicals and thyroid function: an update
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENDOCRINOLOGY DIABETES AND OBESITY
AB Purpose of review
   To overview the effects of endocrine disrupters on thyroid function.
   Recent findings
   Studies in recent years have revealed thyroid-disrupting properties of many environmentally abundant chemicals. Of special concern is the exposure of pregnant women and infants, as thyroid disruption of the developing fetus may have deleterious effects on neurological outcome. Evidence is reviewed for the following groups of chemicals: polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, flame retardants, pesticides, perfluorinated chemicals, phthalates, bisphenol A and ultraviolet filters. Chemicals may exert thyroid effects through a variety of mechanisms of action, and some publications have focused on elucidating the mechanisms of specific (groups of) chemicals.
   Summary
   A large variety of ubiquitous chemicals have been shown to have thyroid-disrupting properties, and the combination of mechanistic, epidemiological and exposure studies indicates that the ubiquitous human and environmental exposure to industrial chemicals may impose a serious threat to human and wildlife thyroid homeostasis. Currently, available evidence suggests that authorities need to regulate exposure to thyroid-disrupting chemicals of pregnant women, neonates and small children in order to avoid potential impairment of brain development. Future studies will indicate whether adults also are at risk of thyroid damage due to these chemicals.

SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS
AB For characterization of corrosion resistance of metallic biomaterials, determination of trace amounts of metallic ions released from the materials in static immersion into simulated body fluids were investigated. In a pre-treatment method by sulfuric acid, sensitive, precise and accurate determination of the trace metallic elements in simulated body fluids could be performed by an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. For accurate analysis, it was necessary to employ a matrix-matched solution for the calibration. Moreover, usage of a vessel made of tetrafluoro ethylene-perfluoro alkylvinyl ether copolymer in the static immersion test was recommended for the prevention of contamination. Thus, it was possible to determine mu g dm(-3) order of elements in simulated body fluids and evaluate nano-gram order of the released metallic ions.

TI A semi-automated solid-phase extraction liquid chromatography/tandem
   mass spectrometry method for the analysis of tetrahydrocannabinol and
   metabolites in whole blood
SO RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY
AB Marijuana is one of the most commonly abused illicit substances in the USA, making cannabinoids important to detect in clinical and forensic toxicology laboratories. Historically, cannabinoids in biological fluids have been derivatized and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). There has been a gradual shift in many laboratories towards liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) for this analysis due to its improved sensitivity and reduced sample preparation compared with GC/MS procedures. This paper reports a validated method for the analysis of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its two main metabolites, 11-nor-9-carboxy-Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) and 11-hydroxy-Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinoI (THC-OH), in whole blood samples. The method has also been validated for cannabinol (CBD) and cannabidiol (CDN), two cannabinoids that were shown not to interfere with the method. This method has been successfully applied to samples both from living people and from deceased individuals obtained during autopsy. This method utilizes online solid-phase extraction (SPE) with LC/MS. Pretreatment of samples involves protein precipitation, sample concentration, ultracentrifugation, and reconstitution. The online SPE procedure was developed using Hysphere C8-EC sorbent. A chromatographic gradient with an Xterra MS C-18 column was used for the separation. Four multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions were monitored for each analyte and internal standard. Linearity generally fell between 2 and 200 ng/mL. The limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 0.5 to 3ng/mL and the limits of quantitation (LOQs) ranged from 2 to 8 ng/mL. The bias and imprecision were determined using a simple analysis of variance (ANOVA: single factor). The results demonstrate bias as <7%, and imprecision as <9%, for all components at each quantity control level. Published in 2009 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Estimation of PM10 Source Contributions on Three Cities in the
   Metropolitan Area by Using PMF Model
SO JOURNAL OF KOREAN SOCIETY FOR ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
AB The Korean government strengthened the environmental polices to manage and enhance Metropolitan Area air quality, and also has enforced "Special Act on Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement (SASMAQI)" issued in Dec. 2004. Recently government expanded the Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD) to the outskirts satellite cities of Seoul area through the "Revised Law Draft of SASMAQI". The SMAQMD has been alloted the allowable emission loads to the local governments on the basis of the carrying PM10 capacity. However, in order to establish the effective air quality control strategy for PM10, it is necessary to understand the corresponding sources which have a potential to directly impact ambient PM10 concentration. To deal with the situations, many receptor methodologies have been developed to identify the origins of pollutants and to determine the contributions of sources of interests.
   The objective of this study was to extensively identify PM10 sources and to estimate their contributions at the metropolitan area. PM10 samples were simultaneously collected at the 3 semi -industrialized local cities in the Seoul metropolitan area such as Hwasung-si, Paju-si, and Icheon-si sites from April 15 to May 31, 2007. The samples collected on the teflon membrane filter by one PM10 cyclone sampler were analyzed for trace metals and soluble ions and samples on the quartz fiber filter by another sampler were analyzed for OC and EC. Source apportionment study was then performed by using a positive matrix factorization (PMF) receptor model. A total of 6 sources were identified and their contributions were estimated in each monitoring site. Contribution results on Hwasung, Paju, and Icheon sites were as follows: 33%, 27%, and 27% from soil source, 26%, 26%, and 21% from secondary aerosol source, 11%, 11%, and 12% from biomass burning, 12%, 6%, and 5% from sea salt, 7%, 15%, and 19% from industrial related source, and finally 11%, 15%, and 16% from mobile and oil complex source, respectively. This study provides information on the major sources affecting air quality in the receptor sites and thus it will help to manage the ambient air quality in the metropolitan area by establishing reasonable control strategies, especially for the anthropogenic emission sources.

TI Minireview: The Case for Obesogens
SO MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Obesity and obesity-related disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, are epidemic in Western countries, particularly the United States. The conventional wisdom holds that obesity is primarily the result of a positive energy balance, i.e. too many calories in and too few calories burned. Although it is self-evident that fat cannot be accumulated without a higher caloric intake than expenditure, recent research in a number of laboratories suggests the existence of chemicals that alter regulation of energy balance to favor weight gain and obesity. These obesogens derail the homeostatic mechanisms important for weight control, such that exposed individuals are predisposed to weight gain, despite normal diet and exercise. This review considers the evidence for obesogens, how they might act, and where future research is needed to clarify their relative contribution to the obesity epidemic.

TI Patent Foramen Ovale in Cryptogenic Stroke Incidental or Pathogenic?
SO STROKE
AB Background and Purpose-Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is significantly associated with cryptogenic stroke (CS). However, even in patients with CS, a PFO can be an incidental finding. We sought to estimate the probability that a PFO in a patient with CS is incidental.
   Methods-A systematic search identified 23 case-control studies examining the prevalence of PFO in patients with CS versus control subjects with stroke of known cause. Using simple assumptions and Bayes' theorem, we calculated the probability a PFO is incidental in patients with CS. Random effects meta-analyses estimated the odds ratio (OR) of a PFO in CS versus control subjects in different age populations, with or without atrial septal aneurysms, and were used to summarize across studies the probability that a PFO in CS is incidental.
   Results-The summary OR (95% CIs) for PFO in CS versus control subjects was 2.9 (CI, 2.1 to 4.0). The corresponding ORs for young and old patients (< or >= 55 years) were 5.1 (3.3 to 7.8) and 2.0 (>1.0 to 3.7), respectively. The corresponding probabilities that a PFO in patients with CS is incidental were 33% (28% to 39%) in age-inclusive studies, 20% (16% to 25%) in younger patients, and 48% (34% to 66%) in older patients. These probabilities were much lower when an atrial septal aneurysm was present.
   Conclusions-In patients with otherwise CS, approximately one third of discovered PFOs are likely to be incidental and hence not benefit from closure. This probability is sensitive to patient characteristics such as age and the presence of an atrial septal aneurysm, suggesting the importance of patient selection in therapeutic decision-making.

AB Humans and ecological species have been found to have detectable body burdens of a number of perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAA) including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). In mouse and rat liver these compounds elicit transcriptional and phenotypic effects similar to peroxisome proliferator chemicals (PPC) that work through the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha). Recent studies indicate that along with PPAR alpha other nuclear receptors are required for transcriptional changes in the mouse liver after PFOA exposure including the constitutive activated receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) that regulate xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XME). To determine the potential role of CAR/PXR in mediating effects of PFAAs in rat liver, we performed a meta-analysis of transcript profiles from published studies in which rats were exposed to PFOA or PFOS. We compared the profiles to those produced by exposure to prototypical activators of CAR, (phenobarbital (PB)), PXR (pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN)), or PPAR alpha (WY-14,643 (WY)). As expected, PFOA and PFOS elicited transcript profile signatures that included many known PPAR alpha target genes. Numerous XME genes were also altered by PFOA and PFOS but not WY. These genes exhibited expression changes shared with PB or PCN. Reexamination of the transcript profiles from the livers of chicken or fish exposed to PEAAs indicated that PPAR alpha, CAR, and PXR orthologs were not activated. Our results indicate that PFAAs under these experimental conditions activate PPAR alpha, CAR, and PXR in rats but not chicken and fish. Lastly, we discuss evidence that human populations with greater CAR expression have lower body burdens of PFAAs. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Prospects for combining chemical and biological methods for integrated
   environmental assessment
SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Inherently interdisciplinary, environmental assessment applied to contamination is evolving rapidly, despite associated uncertainties in methodologies and data limitations. Mixtures of known and unknown pollutants can cause toxic effects in the environment. Besides deploying a chemicals-driven strategy for the ecological risk assessment of the pollutants, it is necessary to apply and to explore biological strategies. Consequently, bioassays, biosensors and effect-directed analysis (EDA) to identify pollutants responsible of particular effects have become increasingly important.
   We give a broad overview of how to assess biological monitoring of ecosystems and chemical monitoring of priority and specific substances involved in environmental contamination. We describe bioanalytical tools and address the need to integrate and to combine them with chemical tools. We also describe the requirement for EDA in field monitoring and risk assessment of pollutants.
   We critically review the literature and present generalized strategies for characterizing environmental contamination, and detecting and categorizing toxicological problems. Last, but not least, we outline the prospects for combining chemical and biological methods for integrated environmental assessment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Conjugated Microporous Polymers
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Conjugated microporous polymers are of great interest because they have potential to combine high surface areas in the dry state with physical properties relevant to organic electronics. A series of recent reports has shown that materials such as poly(aryleneethynylene)s (PAEs), poly(phenylene butadiynylene)s, poly(phenylene vinylene), poly(p-phenylene)s, polysilanes, polyanilines, and polytriazines can be produced as microporous networks with apparent Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas of more than 1000 m(2) g(-1) in some cases. Micropore size and surface area can be synthetically fine tuned in amorphous PAE polymers and copolymers, something which was previously thought to be the preserve of ordered crystalline materials such as metal organic frameworks. We review in this Research News article recent progress made by our group and others with particular emphasis on the possible future applications of these materials.

TI Chemical analysis and quality control of Ginkgo biloba leaves, extracts,
   and phytopharmaceuticals
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB The chemical analysis and quality control of Ginkgo leaves, extracts, phytopharmaceuticals and some herbal supplements is comprehensively reviewed. The review is an update of a similar, earlier review in this journal [T.A. van Beek, J. Chromatogr. A 967 (2002) 21-55]. Since 2001 over 3000 papers on Ginkgo biloba have appeared, and about 400 of them pertain to chemical analysis in a broad sense and are cited herein. The more important ones are discussed and, where relevant. compared with the best methods published prior to 2002. In the same period over 2500 patents were filed on Ginkgo and the very few related to analysis are mentioned as well. Important constituents include terpene trilactones, i.e. ginkgolide A, B, C, J and bilobalide, flavonol glycosides, biflavones, proanthocyanidins. alkylphenols, simple phenolic acids, 6-hydroxykynurenic acid, 4-0-methylpyridoxine and polyprenols. In the most common so-called "standardised" Ginkgo extracts and phytopharmaceuticals several of these classes are no longer present. About 130 new papers deal with the analysis of the terpene trilactones. They are mostly extracted with methanol or water or mixtures thereof. Supercritical fluid extraction and pressurised water extraction are also possible. Sample clean-up is mostly by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate although no sample clean-up at all in combination with LC/MS/MS is gaining in importance. Separation and detection can be routinely carried out by RP-HPLC with ELSD, RI or MS, or by GC/FID or GC/MS after silylation. Hydrolysis followed by LC/MS allows the simultaneous analysis of terpene trilactones and flavonol aglycones. No quantitative procedure for all major flavonol glycosides has yet been published because they are not commercially available. The quantitation of a few available glycosides has been carried out but does not serve a real purpose. After acidic hydrolysis to the aglycones quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin and separation by HPLC, quantitation is straightforward and yields by recalculation an estimation of the original total flavonol glycoside content. A profile of the genuine flavonol glycosides can detect poor storage or adulteration. Although the toxicity of Ginkgo alkylphenols upon oral administration has never been undoubtedly proven, most suppliers limit their content in extracts to 5 ppm and dozens of papers on their analysis were published. One procedure in which a methanolic extract is directly injected on a C8 HPLC column appears superior in terms of sensitivity (<5 ppm), separation, simplicity and validation and will be incorporated in the European Pharmacopoeia. Alternatively GC/MS and ELISA methods can be used. A sharp contrast to the plethora of papers on terpene trilactones, flavonol glycosides, and ginkgolic acids forms the low number of papers on biflavones, proanthocyanidins, simple phenolics, simple acids, and other constituents that make up the remaining 70% of Ginkgo standardised extracts. More research in this direction is clearly needed. For the analysis of Ginkgo proanthocyanidins (7%) for instance, no reliable assays are yet existing. Finally the growing literature on pharmacokinetic and fingerprinting studies of Ginkgo is briefly summarised. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Characterization of two soil metagenome-derived lipases with high
   specificity for p-nitrophenyl palmitate
SO ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB Two novel genes (pwtsB and pwtsC) encoding lipases were isolated by screening the soil metagenomic library. Sequence analysis revealed that pwtsB encodes a protein of 301 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 33 kDa, and pwtsC encodes a protein of 323 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 35 kDa. Furthermore, both genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using pET expression system. The expressed recombinant enzymes were purified by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and characterized by spectrophotometric with different p-nitrophenyl esters. The results showed that PWTSB displayed a high degree of activity and stability at 20A degrees C with an optimal pH of around 8.0, and PWTSC at 40A degrees C with an optimal pH of around 7.0. P-nitrophenyl palmitate (p-NPP) was identified as the best substrate of PWTSB and PWTSC. The specific activities of PWTSB and PWTSC were 150 and 166 U/mg, respectively toward p-NPP at 30A degrees C, about 20-fold higher than that toward p-nitrophenyl butyrate (C4) and caprylate (C8). In conclusion, our results suggest that PWTSB is a cold adapt lipase and PWTSC is a thermostable lipase to long-chain p-nitrophenyl esters.

TI Recent insights into the role of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPIV) and
   aminopeptidase N (APN) families in immune functions
SO CLINICAL CHEMISTRY AND LABORATORY MEDICINE
CT 3rd International Conference on Dipeptidyl Peptidase and Related
   Proteins
CY APR 23-25, 2008
CL Antwerp, BELGIUM
AB Background: In the past, different research groups could show that treatment of immune cells with inhibitors of post-proline splitting dipeptidyl aminopeptidases leads to functional changes in the immune system consistent with immunosuppression. This is due to the inhibition of proliferation of lymphocytes and the production of inflammatory cytokines of the TH1, TH2, and TH17 cells as well as the induction of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and interleukin (IL)-1RA. Until recently, most of the effects of these inhibitors on immune functions were attributed to the inhibition of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPIV/CD26). With the identification of new peptidases of the DPIV family (DASH) with the same or similar substrate specificity [fibroblast activation protein (FAP), DP8/9], the question arose whether and to what extent the inhibition of intracellularly localized enzymes, DP8 and DP9, contribute to the observed immunosuppression. In addition, members of the aminopeptidase N (APN) family are also involved in the regulation of immune functions. Hence, the concept of a combined targeting of both families of peptidases for treatment of inflammatory diseases is a promising strategy.
   Results/Conclusions: Summarizing data obtained from the usage of different non-selective and selective inhibitors of DPIV, DP8/9, FAP, and DPII, this review provides evidence that in addition to DPIV, DP8/9 also regulate the immune response via modulation of cell cycle progression and cytokine production. The strongest and most consistent effects in vitro were, however, observed with non-selective inhibitors for the suppression of DNA synthesis and cytokine production. Similar effects were provoked by APN inhibitors, which were also found to suppress DNA synthesis and the production of inflammatory cytokines in vitro. However, different mechanisms and signaling pathways appear to mediate the cellular effects resulting from the inhibition of either APN or DPIV family members. In particular, members of the APN family uniquely influence the function of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T-cells. Consequently, the concomitant inhibition of both APN and DPIV enzyme families by means of two separate inhibitors or by binary inhibitors with specificity for both enzyme families (PETIR (TM), peptidase targeted immunoregulation) synergistically affects immune cells on the level of cell cycle regulation, suppression of TH1, TH2, and TH17 cytokines as well as the activation of regulatory T-cells. Besides leukocytes, dermal cells as sebocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts are also targeted by these inhibitors. This strongly suggests a broad potential of the multiple anti-inflammatory effects of PETIR (TM) in treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, allergies, and transplant rejections, as well as of inflammatory skin diseases, such as acne, psoriasis, rosacea or atopic dermatitis. The first active dual inhibitor, IP10.C8, has been developed by IMTM for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases and has just entered the first phase II study.

TI Metal Extraction from Water and Organic Solvents into Fluorous Solvents
   by Fluorinated beta-Diketone and Its Application to the Colorimetric
   Analysis of Metal Ions
SO ANALYTICAL SCIENCES
AB A metal extraction system using fluorous solvents has been developed. Perfluorinated beta-diketone, 1,1,1,5,5,6,6,6-octafluoro-2,4-hexanedione (C6F8 beta DK) dissolves in the fluorous solvent FC-72 and can extract transition metal ions from water into FC-72. The extraction efficiency in the FC-72 system is comparable to that of chloroform. By using the immiscibility of FC-72 with conventional organic solvents, metal extraction was also achieved from acetonitrile and dioxane. Metal ions extracted into FC-72 can be readily stripped using 1 M nitric acid. We succeeded in a colorimetric assay of metal ion concentration in water and in organic solvents by contacting each solvent with FC-72 containing C6F8 beta DK. Iron ions with different concentrations (0 - 0.1 mM) in water or acetonitrile are completely extracted into FC-72 to form a Fe3+-C6F8 beta DK complex, which can be detected by spectrophotometry due to its absorption in the UV-vis re-ion. We have demonstrated that fluorous Solvents would be promising candidates for a novel separation and analytical medium for metal ions.

   Minichannels
CY JUN 22-24, 2009

SP ASME
AB Liquid-liquid segmented flows in microchannels fabricated on polymer test chips were investigated experimentally. Polymer test chips were prepared using hot embossing of polycarbonate (PC) sheets with micro-milled brass mold inserts. Three different configurations of microchannels were prepared with injection to test channels expansion ratios of 16, 4 and 2 and a fixed test channel geometry. Deionized water with blue food-coloring dye (1% v/v) was used as a dispersed fluid at flow rates (Q(D)) between 0.5 and 60 mu l/min. The carrier fluid was perfluorocarbon (FC 3283) with nonionic fluorous-soluble surfactant (Perfluorooctanol, 10% v/v) at flow rates (Q(C)) between 3 and 25 mu l/min. The two fluids were injected separately into the chips. Droplet and Plug flows with transient Irregular Segmented flows between two flow regimes were mainly observed in the test channels of the three different chips. Flow pattern maps and transitions between flow regimes were determined in terms of a fixed homogeneous carrier fluid volumetric flow ratio (beta(C)) to compare the effect of the expansion ratios from the injection to the test channels. The droplet and plug regimes were shifted to higher carrier and lower dispersed fluid superficial velocities and the plug flow regime was broader with the lower expansion ratio channels. The transient irregular segmented flow was favored in the higher expansion channel ratio and the interval of transient irregular segmented flow between droplet and plug flow regimes were shorter for the low expansion channel ratios. This is evidence that flow regime maps in micro-channels are not universal and depend on the configuration part of the microinjection system. The length of the dispersed segmented flows and the distance between consecutive droplets or plugs as a function of beta(C) were determined by image processing of frames acquired via CCD camera with bright field illumination. The average length of the dispersed fluid was shown to scale approximately with beta(C) to the -1.2 power. Velocities of the dispersed droplet and plug flows were measured using double-pulsed laser illumination and were found to be 1.25 +/- 0.049 and 1.46 +/- 0.077 times faster than the superficial velocity of the segmented flow respectively. Two-phase pressure drop measurements were also carried out for all flow regimes and associated trends were correlated with changes in flow topology. Comparisons of experimental pressure drop with the predictions for a modified Lockhart-Martinelli correlation were also made.

TI Sensors as tools for quantitation, nanotoxicity and nanomonitoring
   assessment of engineered nanomaterials
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
AB The discovery of fullerenes in 1985 has ushered in an explosive growth in the applications of engineered nanomaterials and consumer products. Nanotechnology and engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are being incorporated into a range of commercial products such as consumer electronics, cosmetics, imaging and sensors. Nanomaterials offer new possibilities for the development of novel sensing and monitoring technologies. Nanosensors can be classified under two main categories: (i) Nanotechnology-enabled sensors or sensors that are themselves nanoscale or have nanoscale materials or components, and (ii) Nanoproperty-quantifiable sensors or sensors that are used to measure nanoscale properties. The first category can eventually result in lower material cost, reduced weight and energy consumption. The second category can enhance our understanding of the potential toxic effects of emerging pollutants from nanomaterials including fullerenes, dendrimers, and carbon nanotubes. Despite the enormous literatures and reviews on Category I sensors, there are few sensors to measure nanoscale properties or sensors belonging to Category II. This class of nanosensors is an area of critical interest to nanotoxicology, detection and risk assessment, as well as for monitoring of environmental and/or biological exposure. This article discusses emerging fields of nanotoxicology and nanomonitoring including the challenges of characterizing engineered nanomaterials and the potentials of combining existing analytical techniques with conventional cytotoxicity methods. Two case studies are provided for development of Category II nanosensors for fullerene nanoparticles and quantum dots. One highlights the uniqueness of a portable, dissolved oxygen electrochemical sensor arrays capable of detecting the ENMs as well as provide rapid nanotoxicological information. This review has shown that addressing the complex and critical issues surrounding the environmental transformation and toxicity of ENMs must be accompanied by the creation of new approaches or further developments of existing instrumentation.

TI Perfluoroalkyl sulfonic and carboxylic acids: A critical review of
   physicochemical properties, levels and patterns in waters and
   wastewaters, and treatment methods
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS
   SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
AB Perfluorinated acids (PFAs) are an emerging class of environmental contaminants present in various environmental and biological matrices. Two major PFA subclasses are the perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) and carboxylic acids (PFCAs). The physicochemical properties and partitioning behavior for the linear PFA members are poorly understood and widely debated. Even less is known about the numerous branched congeners with varying perfluoroalkyl chain lengths, leading to confounding issues around attempts to constrain the properties of PFAs. Current computational methods are not adequate for reliable multimedia modeling efforts and risk assessments. These compounds are widely present in surface, ground, marine, and drinking waters at concentrations that vary from pg L-1 to mu g L-1. Concentration gradients of up to several orders of magnitude are observed in all types of aquatic systems and reflect proximity to known industrial sources concentrated near populated regions. Some wastewaters contain PFAs at mg L-1 to low g L-1 levels, or up to 10 orders of magnitude higher than present in more pristine receiving waters. With the exception of trifluoroacetic acid, which is thought to have both significant natural and anthropogenic sources, all PFSAs and PFCAs are believed to arise from human activities. Filtration and sorption technologies offer the most promising existing removal methods for PFAs in aqueous waste streams, although sonochemical approaches hold promise. Additional studies need to be conducted to better define opportunities from evaporative, extractive, thermal, advanced oxidative, direct and catalyzed photochemical, reductive, and biodegradation methods. Most PFA treatment methods exhibit slow kinetic profiles, hindering their direct application in conventional low hydraulic residence time systems.

TI Detection of ketamine and its metabolites in urine by ultra high
   pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL
   AND LIFE SCIENCES
AB Current analytical methods used for screening drugs and their metabolites in biological samples from victims of drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) or other vulnerable groups can lack sufficient sensitivity. The application of liquid chromatography. employing small particle sizes, with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is likely to offer the sensitivity required for detecting candidate drugs and/or their metabolites in urine, as demonstrated here for ketamine. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was performed following extraction of urine (4 mL) using mixed-mode (cation and C8) solid-phase cartridges. Only 20 mu L of the 250 mu L extract was injected, leaving sufficient volume for other assays important in DFSA cases. Three ion transitions were chosen for confirmatory purposes. As ketamine and norketamine (including their stable isotopes) are available as reference standards, the assay was additionally validated for quantification purposes to study elimination of the drug and primary metabolite following a small oral dose of ketamine (50 mg) in 6 volunteers. Dehydronorketamine, a secondary metabolite, was also analyzed qualitatively to determine whether monitoring could improve retrospective detection of administration. The detection limit for ketamine and norketamine was 0.03 ng/mL and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively, and these compounds could be confirmed in urine for up to 5 and 6 days, respectively. Dehydronorketamine was confirmed up to 10 days, providing a very broad window of detection. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Shoot calcium and magnesium concentrations differ between subtaxa, are
   highly heritable, and associate with potentially pleiotropic loci in
   Brassica oleracea
SO PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
AB Calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) are the most abundant group II elements in both plants and animals. Genetic variation in shoot Ca and shoot Mg concentration (shoot Ca and Mg) in plants can be exploited to biofortify food crops and thereby increase dietary Ca and Mg intake for humans and livestock. We present a comprehensive analysis of within-species genetic variation for shoot Ca and Mg, demonstrating that shoot mineral concentration differs significantly between subtaxa (varietas). We established a structured diversity foundation set of 376 accessions to capture a high proportion of species-wide allelic diversity within domesticated Brassica oleracea, including representation of wild relatives (C genome, 1n = 9) from natural populations. These accessions and 74 modern F-1 hybrid cultivars were grown in glasshouse and field environments. Shoot Ca and Mg varied 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively, and was typically not inversely correlated with shoot biomass, within most subtaxa. The closely related capitata (cabbage) and sabauda (Savoy cabbage) subtaxa consistently had the highest mean shoot Ca and Mg. Shoot Ca and Mg in glasshouse-grown plants was highly correlated with data from the field. To understand and dissect the genetic basis of variation in shoot Ca and Mg, we studied homozygous lines from a segregating B. oleracea mapping population. Shoot Ca and Mg was highly heritable (up to 40%). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for shoot Ca and Mg were detected on chromosomes C2, C6, C7, C8, and, in particular, C9, where QTL accounted for 14% to 55% of the total genetic variance. The presence of QTL on C9 was substantiated by scoring recurrent backcross substitution lines, derived from the same parents. This also greatly increased the map resolution, with strong evidence that a 4-cM region on C9 influences shoot Ca. This region corresponds to a 0.41-Mb region on Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) chromosome 5 that includes 106 genes. There is also evidence that pleiotropic loci on C8 and C9 affect shoot Ca and Mg. Map-based cloning of these loci will reveal how shoot-level phenotypes relate to Ca 21 and Mg 21 uptake and homeostasis at the molecular level.

TI Are PFCAs bioaccumulative? A critical review and comparison with
   regulatory lipophilic compounds
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Perfluorinated acids, including perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs),and perfluorinated sulfonates(PFASs), are environmentally persistent and have been detected in a variety of wildlife across the globe. The most commonly detected PFAS, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), has been classified as a persistent and bioaccumulative substance. Similarities in chemical structure and environmental behavior of PFOS and the PFCAs that have been detected in wildlife have generated concerns about the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs. Differences between partitioning behavior of perfluorinated acids and persistent lipophilic compounds complicate the understanding of PFCA bioaccumulation and the subsequent classification of the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs according to existing regulatory criteria. Based on available research on the bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids, five key points are highlighted in this review: (1) bioconcentration and bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids are directly related to the length of each compound's fluorinated carbon chain; (2) PFASs are more bioaccumulative than PFCAs of the same fluorinated carbon chain length; (3) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (perfluorooctanoate (PFO) and shorter PFCAs) are not considered bioaccumulative according to the range of promulgated bioaccumulation,"B", regulatory criteria of 1000-5000 L/kg; (4) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less have low biomagnification potential in food webs, and (5) more research is necessary to fully characterize the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains (>7 fluorinated carbons), as PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains may exhibit partitioning behavior similar to or greater than PFOS. The bioaccumulation potential of perfluorinated acids with seven fluorinated carbons or less appears to be several orders of magnitude lower than "legacy" persistent lipophilic compounds classified as bioaccumulative. Thus, although many PFCAs are environmentally persistent and can be present at detectable concentrations in wildlife, it is clear that PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (including PFO) are not bioaccumulative according to regulatory criteria.

TI The research of human exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers and
   perfluoroocatane sulfonate
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB As two kinds of emerging chemicals, the pollution of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluoroocatane sulfonate (PFOS) has been becoming a global environmental problem. Also, research of the transport, transfer, bioaccumulation in organism, and toxicology of these two kinds of pollutant is a hotspot in environmental sciences now. In this paper, we summarize and critically review the status and progress of PBDEs and PFOS exposure to human beings. Further, data analyses based on statistical methods are done to study the characters of PBDEs and PCBs concentrations in different regions in the world.

TI Evaluation of a protocol for metabolic profiling studies on human blood
   plasma by combined ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass
   spectrometry: From extraction to data analysis
SO ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The investigation presented here describes a protocol designed to perform high-throughput metabolic profiling analysis on human blood plasma by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS). To address whether a previous extraction protocol for gas chromatography(GC)/MS-based metabolic profiling of plasma could be used for UPLC/MS-based analysis, the original protocol was compared with similar methods for extraction of low-molecular-weight compounds from plasma via protein precipitation. Differences between extraction methods could be observed, but the previously published extraction method was considered the best. UPLC columns with three different stationary phases (C8, C18, and phenyl) were used in identical experimental runs consisting of a total of 60 injections of extracted male and female plasma samples. The C8 column was determined to be the best for metabolic profiling analysis on plasma. The acquired UPLC/MS data of extracted male and female plasma samples was subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Furthermore, a strategy for compound identification was applied here, demonstrating the strength of high-mass-accuracy time-of-flight (TOF)/MS analysis in metabolic profiling. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

TI A Meta-Analysis of the Impact of the Two-Layer Method of Preservation on
   Human Pancreatic Islet Transplantation
SO CELL TRANSPLANTATION
AB There are conflicting reports about the effectiveness of perfluorocarbons used in the two-layer method (TLM) of pancreas preservation for human islet transplantation. The mechanism of action is unclear and the optimal role of this method uncertain. The study design was a meta-analysis of the evidence that TLM improves islet isolation outcomes. Pubmed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, Science Citation Index. and BIOSIS were searched electronically in January 2008. After selecting the relevant human trials for meta-analysis data relating to donor variables, study design, primary and secondary islet isolation Outcomes were extracted. Electronic searches identified eight unique citations, describing I I human Studies that were eligible for the meta-analysis. When comparing TLM with preservation in University of Wisconsin (UW) Solution, there was a statistically significant higher islet yield [WMD 711.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 140.03-1283.07] in the TLM group. The proportion of transplantable preparations obtained was not significantly different (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.89-1.88) between the two groups. The rate of successful islet isolations for marginal organs was higher in the TLM group (OR 6.69, 95% CI 1.80-24.87). Improved oxygenation and preservation of cellular bioengertics is thought to be the main underlying mechanism, although no single mechanism has yet been confirmed. There is currently no clear evidence that the TLM is beneficial in human islet transplantation. It may improve the preservation of marginal organs.

TI Purification and three-dimensional electron Microscopy structure of the
   Neisseria meningitidis type IV pilus biogenesis protein PilG
SO JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY
AB Type IV pili are surface-exposed retractable fibers which play a key role in the pathogenesis of Neisseria meningitidis and other gram-negative pathogens. PilG is an integral inner membrane protein and a component of the type IV pilus biogenesis system. It is related by sequence to the extensive GspF family of secretory proteins, which are involved in type II secretion processes. PilG was overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli membranes by detergent extraction and metal ion affinity chromatography. Analysis of the purified protein by perfluoro-octanoic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that PiIG formed dimers and tetramers. A three-dimensional (3-D) electron microscopy structure of the PiIG multimer was determined using single-particle averaging applied to samples visualized by negative staining. Symmetry analysis of the unsymmetrized 3-D volume provided further evidence that the PiIG multimer is a tetramer. The reconstruction also revealed an asymmetric bilobed structure approximately 125 A in length and 80 angstrom in width. The larger lobe within the structure was identified as the N terminus by location of Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid nanogold particles to the N-terminal polyhistidine tag. We propose that the smaller lobe corresponds to the periplasmic domain of the protein, with the narrower "waist" region being the transmembrane section. This constitutes the first report of a 3-D structure of a member of the GspF family and suggests a physical basis for the role of the protein in linking cytoplasmic and periplasmic protein components of the type II secretion and type IV pilus biogenesis systems.

TI Malignant distal biliary obstruction: A systematic review and
   meta-analysis of endoscopic and surgical bypass results
SO CANCER TREATMENT REVIEWS
AB Background: Surgical bypass and endoscopic stents are available for palliative bypass of malignant distal biliary obstruction.
   Aim: Comparison of reported outcomes in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which included surgery, endoscopic plastic stents or endoscopic metal stents in palliative relief of malignant distal biliary obstruction.
   Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature and conference proceedings review to June 2006.
   Results: We found 24 studies, containing 2436 patients, which met our inclusion criteria. Endoscopic stenting with plastic stents (three studies) is associated with a lower risk of complications (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45-0.81), but a higher risk of recurrent biliary obstruction (RR 18.59, 95% CI 5.33 -64.86) than traditional surgical bypass. Self-expanding metal stents (seven studies) are associated with a significantly reduced risk of recurrent biliary obstruction at 4 months (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.3, 0.63), or prior to death or end of study (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39-0.69), but are not superior to plastic stents in terms of technical success, therapeutic success, mortality or complications. Cost-effectiveness outcomes were not suitable for meta-analysis. No other plastic stent designs have been demonstrated to be superior to polyethylene stents (12 studies).
   Conclusions: Endoscopic metal stents are the intervention of choice in patients with malignant distal biliary obstruction, producing similar outcomes to plastic stents, but with improved patency rates. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Determining aluminum dissolution when cooking food in aluminium cans
SO CIENCIA E TECNOLOGIA DE ALIMENTOS
AB Aluminum is associated with neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer by some authors. Although this has never been confirmed, there is evidence of an accumulation in kidneys of people with renal problems. This present work was carried out to address this subject by evaluating the occurrence of significant aluminum migration from cooking utensils during food preparation. Eight types of food cooked in different ways and three distinct types of pans (a saucepan, pressure cooker and frying pan), with and without teflon coating, were evaluated. The metal analysis was conducted in an Optical Emission Spectrometer with Inductively Coupled Plasma. The results showed insignificant transference of aluminum in some food products. The main transference occurred when tomato sauce was prepared, which has a low pH, in the pan without teflon coating. The menu prepared with all the foods for two meals in a day showed that the aluminum mass incorporated by the food corresponded to 2% of the daily consumption limit of aluminum for a 60 kg person (1 mg.kg(-1) of body weight per day). Thus, the use of aluminum pans in food cooking practically does not interfere in the total consumption of aluminum allowed for people.

TI Fabrication and impedance studies of DMFC anode incorporated with
   CNT-supported high-metal-content electrocatalyst
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB In this study, the fabrication of a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) anode with the incorporation of a multiwalled carbon nanotube (CNT)supported high-metal-content Pt/Ru electrocatalyst, i.e., 40 wt%Pt-20 wt%Ru/CNT, using a novel approach and the resultant DMFC performances were investigated. Employing a vacuum filtration method, we were able to successfully fabricate the DMFC anode with a good electrode structure using an in-house prepared Pt-Ru/CNT electrocatalyst. The catalyst layer was formed directly on a Teflon-treated carbon cloth having a buckypaper texture with a catalyst loading of 4.0 Mg cm(-2). From single-cell tests, excellent cell performances were obtained. At 80 degrees C, the power density was found to be as high as > 100 MW cm(-2). This can be attributed to a thinner catalyst layer formed with a more efficient utilization of the catalyst than that using a low-metal-content counterpart, i.e., 20 wt%Pt- 10 wt%Ru/CNT, as reported in an earlier study. However, the Nafton((R)) ionomer content in the catalyst layer played a key role in the anode fabrication to obtain a good cell performance. In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with a constant phase element (CPE)-based equivalent-circuit model was employed to analyze the fabricated anode. It distinctively revealed some specific characteristics in the resistances and the interface properties. Overall, the obtained impedance results are somewhat different from those of a conventional DMFC anode with the catalyst layer coated onto a porous gas diffusion layer (GDL) on a carbon backing material. Based on the experimental results and the impedance analyses, the high-metal-content Pt-Ru/CNT catalyst was found to be much more favorable and suitable for use as a DMFC anode catalyst.

TI Fluorinated liquid crystals - properties and applications
SO CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
AB This critical review begins with a brief, but essential, introduction to the special nature of liquid crystal materials, their peculiar properties, and their commercial applications, followed by an introductory insight into the remarkable nature of the fluoro substituent, and its fascinating influence on the properties of organic compounds. However, the main focus of the review is to discuss the enormous amount of exciting research on fluorinated liquid crystals that has been reported. The small size of the fluoro substituent enables its incorporation into all types of liquid crystal, including calamitic, discotic, banana, lyotropic, and polymers, without ruining the liquid crystalline nature of the material. However the fluoro substituent is larger than hydrogen, and hence causes a significant steric effect, which combined with the high polarity, confers many fascinating, and often remarkable, modifications to melting point, mesophase morphology and transition temperatures, and the many other very important physical properties, such as dielectric anisotropy, optical anisotropy, and visco- elastic properties. There are many different positions within a liquid crystal structure where a fluoro substituent can be located, including ( i) a terminal position, ( ii) within a terminal chain, as a semi- fluorinated or as a perfluorinated chain, or as one fluoro substituent at a chiral centre, ( iii) as part of a linking group, and ( iv) a lateral position in the core section. Such variety enables the interesting and advantageous tailoring of properties, both for the fundamental purposes of establishing structure - property relationships, and for materials targeted towards commercially- successful liquid crystal display applications.

TI Steric modulation of coordination number and reactivity in the synthesis
   of Lanthanoid(III) formamidinates
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Reactions of a range of the readily prepared and sterically tunable N,N'-bis(aryl)formamidines with lanthanoid metals and bis(pentafluorophenyl)mercury (Hg(C6F5)(2)) in THF have given an extensive series of tris (formamidinato) lanthanoid (III) complexes, [Ln(Form)(3)(thf)(n)), namely [La(o-TolForm)(3)(thf)(2)], [Er(oTolForm)(3)(thf)], [La(XylForm)(3)(thf)], [Sm(XylForm)(3)], [Ln(MesForm)(3)] (Ln=La, Nd, Sm and Yb), [Ln(EtForm)(3)] (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Ho and Yb), and [Ln(o-PhPhForm)(3)] (Ln=La, Nd, Sm and Er). [For an explanation of the N,N'-bis(aryl)formamidinate abbreviations used see Scheme 1.] Analogous attempts to prepare [Yb(o-TolForm)(3)] by this method invariably yielded [{Yb(o-TolForm)(2)(mu-OH)(thf)}(2)], but [Yb(o-TolForm)(3)] was isolated from a metathesis synthesis. Xray crystal structures show exclusively N,N'-chelation of the Form ligands and a gradation in coordination number with Ln(3+) size and with Form ligand bulk. The largest ligands, MesForm, EtForm and o-PhPhForm give solely homoleptic complexes, the first two being six-coordinate, the last having an eta(1)-pi-Ar-Ln interaction. Reaction of lanthanoid elements and Hg(C6F5)(2) with the still bulkier DippFormH in THF resulted in C-F activation and formation of [Ln(DippForm)(2)F(thf)] (Ln=La, Ce, Nd, Sm and Tm) complexes, and o-HC6F4O(CH2)(4)DippForm in which the formamidine is functionalised by a ring-opened THF that has trapped tetrafluorobenzyne. Analogous reactions between Ln metals, Hg(o-HC6F4)(2) and DippFormH yielded [Ln(Dipfform)(2)F(thf)] (Ln=La, Sm and Nd) and 3,4,5-F3C6H2O(CH2),DippForm. X-ray crystal structures of the heteroleptic fluorides show six-coordinate monomers with two chelating DippForm ligands and cisoid fluoride and THF ligands in a trigonal prismatic array. The organometallic species [Ln(DippForm)(2)(C  CPh)(thf)] (Ln = Nd or Sm) are obtained from reaction of Nd metal, bis(phenylethynyl)mercury (Hg(C  CPh)(2)) and DippFormH, and the oxidation of [Sm(DippForm)2(thf),] with Hg(C  CPh)(2), respectively The monomeric, six-coordinate, cisoid [Ln(DippForm)(2)(C  CPh)(thf)] complexes have trigonal prismatic geometries and rare (for Ln) terminal (C  CPh groups with contrasting Ln-C  C angles (Ln= Nd, 170.9(4)degrees; Ln=Sm, 142.9(7)degrees). Their formation lends support to the view that [Ln(DippForm)(2)F(thf)] complexes arise from oxidative formation and C-F activation of [Ln(DippForm)(2)(C6F5)] intermediates.

TI Particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) from different areas of Puerto Rico
SO FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB Fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10) particles were characterized in different sites of Puerto Rico during 2000 to 2003. The sites were established in urban areas (Guaynabo, Salinas and Vieques) and in a reference site (Fajardo) at the east coast. Particulate matter (PM) samples were collected in Teflon and quartz filters then weighed and processed. PM mass concentrations in Teflon filter were determined gravimetrically and estimated for quartz. Samples were digested for metal analyses with appropriate field blanks. Seven to eight metals (Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, V and Zn) plus arsenic (As) were analyzed in each sample by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. Average PM10 levels were around 25 mu g m(-3) in all sites being, lower than the limits established by USEPA (50 mu g m(-3)). The annual average level of PM2.5 in Guaynabo was 11.6 mu g m(-3) versus 8.5 mu g m(-3) in Fajardo. Most of the metals were present at higher levels in the urban sites (Guaynabo, Vieques and Salinas) than at the reference site (Fajardo). All species analyzed in PM2.5, except Fe, were significantly higher at Guaynabo when compared to Fajardo. Ni and V exhibited the highest metal concentrations (Ni = 17 ng m(-3) and V = 40 ng m(-3)) in Guaynabo. Fe showed stronaer relationships between PM at each site suggesting their release from similar sources at that particular location, probably due to Sahara dust.

TI Ochratoxin A: An overview on toxicity and carcinogenicity in animals and
   humans
SO MOLECULAR NUTRITION & FOOD RESEARCH
AB Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a ubiquitous mycotoxin produced by fungi of improperly stored food products. OTA is nephrotoxic and is suspected of being the main etiological agent responsible for human Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) and associated urinary tract tumours. Striking similarities between OTA-induced porcine nephropathy in pigs and BEN in humans are observed. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified OTA as a possible human carcinogen (group 2B). Currently, the mode of carcinogenic action by OTA is unknown. OTA is genotoxic following oxidative metabolism. This activity is thought to play a central role in OTA-mediated carcinogenesis and may be divided into direct (covalent DNA adduction) and indirect (oxidative DNA damage) mechanisms of action. Evidence for a direct mode of genotoxicity has been derived from the sensitive P-32-postlabelling assay. OTA facilitates guanine-specific DNA adducts in vitro and in rat and pig kidney orally dosed, one adduct comigrates with a synthetic carbon (C)-bonded C8-dG OTA adduct standard. In this paper, our current understanding of OTA toxicity and carcinogenicity are reviewed. The available evidence suggests that OTA is a genotoxic carcinogen by induction of oxidative DNA lesions coupled with direct DNA adducts via quinone formation. This mechanism of action should be used to establish acceptable intake levels of OTA from human food sources.

AB GOSAT Project is a joint project of MOE (Ministry of the Environment), JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and NIES (National Institute for Environmental Studies). Data acquired by TANSO-FTS (Fourier Transform Spectrometer) and TANSO-CAI (Cloud and Aerosol Imager) on GOSAT will be collected at Tsukuba Space Center at JAXA. The level I A and I B data of FTS (interferogram and spectra, respectively) and the level I A of CAI (uncorrected data) will be generated at JAXA and will be transferred to GOSAT Data Handling facility (DHF) at NIES for further processing. Radiometric and geometric correction will be applied to CAI L1A data to generate CAI L1B data. From CAI LIB data, cloud coverage and aerosol information (CAI Level 2 data) will be estimated. The FTS data that is recognized to have "low cloud coverage" by CAI will be processed to generate column amount of carbon dioxide CO2 and methane CH4 (FTS Level 2 data).

TI Cellular effects and metabolic stability of N1-cyclic inosine
   diphosphoribose and its derivatives
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB Background and purpose: Recently, a number of mimics of the second messenger cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) with replacement of adenosine by inosine were introduced. In addition, various alterations in the molecule ranging from substitutions at C8 of the base up to full replacement of the ribose moieties still retained biological activity. However, nothing is known about the metabolic stability and cellular effects of these novel analogues.
   Experimental approach: cADPR and the inosine-based analogues were incubated with CD38, ADP-ribosyl cyclase and NAD-glycohydrolase and metabolism was analysed by RP-HPLC. Furthermore, the effect of the analogues on cytokine expression and proliferation was investigated in primary T-lymphocytes and T-lymphoma cells.
   Key results: Incubation of cADPR with CD38 resulted in degradation to adenosine diphosphoribose. ADP-ribosyl cyclase weakly catabolised cADPR whereas NAD-glycohydrolase showed no such activity. In contrast, N1-cyclic inosine 5'-diphosphoribose (N1-cIDPR) was not hydrolyzed by CD38. Three additional N1-cIDPR analogues showed a similar stability. Proliferation of Jurkat T-lymphoma cells was inhibited by N1-cIDPR, N1-[(phosphoryl-O-ethoxy)-methyl]-N9-[(phosphoryl-Oethoxy)methyl]-hypoxanthine-cyclic pyrophosphate (N1-cIDP-DE) and N1-ethoxymethyl-cIDPR (N1-cIDPRE). In contrast, in primary T cells neither proliferation nor cytokine expression was affected by these compounds.
   Conclusions and Implications: The metabolic stability of N1- cIDPR and its analogues provides an advantage for the development of novel pharmaceutical compounds interfering with cADPR mediated Ca2+ signalling pathways. The differential effects of N1-cIDPR and N1-cIDPRE on proliferation and cytokine expression in primary T cells versus T-lymphoma cells may constitute a starting point for novel anti-tumor drugs.

TI Evaluation of D-isomers of O-F-18-fluoromethyl, O-F-18-fluoroethyl and
   O-F-18-fluoropropyl tyrosine as tumour imaging agents in mice
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the properties of the D-amino acid isomers O-F-18-fluoromethyl tyrosine (F-18-FMT), O-F-18-fluoroethyl tyrosine (F-18-FET) and O-F-18-fluoropropyl tyrosine (F-18-FPT) as tumour-detecting agents with PET in comparison with the corresponding L-isomers. L- or D-F-18-FMT, F-18-FET or F-18-FPT, prepared by F-18-fluoromethylation, F-18-fluoroethylation or F-18-fluoropropylation of L- and D-tyrosine, was intravenously injected into BALB/cA Jcl-nu mice bearing HeLa tumour cells. At 5, 15, 30 and 60 min post intravenous administration, the uptake of each compound in normal abdominal organs and xenotransplanted HeLa cells was determined using the tissue dissection method. Metabolic stability analyses of these compounds in the plasma were performed with the thin-layer chromatography method. In the plasma fraction, although L- and D-isomers of F-18-FMT, F-18-FET and F-18-FPT provided comparable metabolic stability, D-isomers of these labelled compounds revealed a faster elimination rate than their L-isomers, with a higher peak uptake in the blood and kidney 5 min post administration. Compared with natural amino acid ligands, such as L-C-11-methionine, the uptake of L-isomers of these labelled compounds was relatively low and stable in the abdominal organs, while D-isomers revealed much lower and faster clearance rates compared with the corresponding L- isomers. Among the abdominal organs, the pancreas showed relatively high uptake of all the labelled compounds used here, and the uptake of D-isomers was much lower than that of the L- isomers. Although tumour uptake levels of D-isomers of F-18-FMT, F-18-FET and F-18-FPT were almost 95%, 43% and 39% of the uptake levels of each of the L- isomers 60 min post administration, the tumour-to-blood ratios of these D-isomers were 181%, 137% and 101% of the ratios of the corresponding L-isomers. D-isomers of F-18-FMT and F-18-FET indicated improved tumour-to-liver ratios compared with the corresponding L-isomers, and D-F-18-FPT showed the highest tumour-to-pancreas ratio among all the other compounds assayed here. These results suggest that D-isomers of F-18-fluoroalkyl tyrosine analogues are potential tracers for tumour imaging with PET.

AB Noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, and pi-pi stacking, are increasingly being utilized to develop well-ordered and self-organized supramolecular materials. Recently, new types of nonclassical weak interactions, such as C-H-...pi, C-(HF)-F-...-C, and C-(HO)-O-..., have been exploited in stabilizing the specific conformations of molecules and molecular assemblies in the solid state. These noncovalent interactions play an important role in materials comprised of polymer chains, because cooperative effects from a large number of weak interactions can lead to drastic changes in its conformation, several properties, and functionalities. The programmed design of synthetic helical polymer with well-defined molecular conformation has been the main subject in modern polymer science and engineering. Silicon-catenated polysilane is an ideal helical silicon quantum wire and polymers with unique photophysical properties. The present review highlights the spectroscopic evidences for through-space weak (SiF)-F-...-C interaction in poly(methyl-3,3,3-trifluoropropylsilane) (1) in noncoordinating and coordinating solvents by means of NMR (Si-29 and F-19) and IR spectroscopies, and viscometric measurement. It was found that 1 is applicable for chemosensors with an extremely high sensitivity and selectivity toward fluoride ions in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and with high sensitivity for nitroaromatic compounds, detected by a decrease in the photoluminescence intensity in THF and in thin solid film.

TI Abatement of PFCs from semiconductor manufacturing processes by
   nonthermal plasma technologies: A critical review
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB Emission of various hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and greenhouse gases including perfluorocompounds (PFCs) from semiconductor industries, which individually may cause great impact on human health and the global environment, has attracted much public attention. In this paper, a potential application of nonthermal plasma technologies as an integrated approach for abating the emission of these gaseous pollutants is critically reviewed. Relevant studies indicate that direct electron impact with PFC molecules to form PFC fragment radicals is the first step leading to the destruction of PFCs in nonthermal plasmas (NTPs) and that further reactions of PFC fragments with radicals are essential for the effective removal of PFCs. Previous studies demonstrate that nonthermal plasma combined with catalyst or adsorbent has a good potential to be used as an integrated technology for abating PFCs from complicated gas streams of semiconductor manufacturing processes.

TI Experimental and DFT studies of cationic imido titanium alkyls: Agostic
   interactions and C-H bond and solvent activation reactions of isolobal
   analogues of group 4 metallocenium cations
SO ORGANOMETALLICS
AB Synthesis, reactions, and DFT studies of macrocycle-supported imido titanium alkyl cations derived from Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))R-2 (R = Me ( 1) or CH2SiMe3 (2)) are described (Me-3[9]aneN(3) = 1,4,7-trimethyltriazacyclononane). Reaction of 1 with 1 equiv of [Ph3C][BAr4F] or BAr3F (ArF) C6F5) in C6D5Br afforded the methyl cation [Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))Me](+) (6(+)), whereas with half an equivalent of [Ph3C][BAr4F] the fluxional methyl-bridged homo-binuclear cation [Ti-2((NBu)-Bu-t)(2)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))(2)Me-2(mu-Me)](+) (10(+)) was formed. Reaction of 1 with [Ph3C][BAr4F] in CD2Cl2 formed the monochloride cation [Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))Cl](+) (8(+)), which was also prepared from Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))Cl(Me) and [Ph3C][BAr4F]. Cation 8(+) reacted with pyridine to give the adduct [Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3)) Cl(py)]+ (9(+)) and with Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))Me-2 to form the chloride-bridged cation [Ti-2((NBu)-Bu-t)(2)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))(2)Me-2( mu-Cl)](+) (11(+)). Reaction of 2 with [Ph3C][BAr4F] gave [Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))(CH2SiMe3)](+) (7(+)), which is stabilized by beta-Si-C agostic interaction characterized by a high-field-shifted 29Si NMR resonance. Attempts to generate 7(+) by reaction of 2 with [PhNMe2H][BAr4F] in CH2Cl2 led to Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))Cl-2 and [PhNMe2(CH2Cl)][BAr4F] (12-BAr4F) via a series of solvent activation reactions, the details of which have been elucidated. Reaction of 6+ or 7+ with Ph3PO afforded the adducts [Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))R(Ph3PO)]+, whereas with pyridine a C-H bond activation reaction occurred to give [Ti((NBu)-Bu-t)(Me-3[9]aneN(3))(NC5H4)](+) (17(+)) and the corresponding alkane RH. Density functional theory calculations of the isolobal d(0) fragments [Ti(NR)(R'(3)[9]aneN(3))](2+) and [Cp2Ti](2+) found that their frontier orbitals, although broadly similar, featured important differences in their shapes and energies. These account for the absence of any alpha-C-H agostic interaction in 6+, whereas [ Cp2TiMe]+ is stabilized by a weak interaction of this type, as judged by DFT-computed geometries. The experimentally observed increase in Ti-Me group average (1)J(CH) on forming either 6(+) from 1 or [ Cp2TiMe]+ from Cp2TiMe2 is reproduced by DFT and attributed to intrinsic global changes in carbon 2s orbital contribution to the Ti-C and C-H bonds upon cation formation.
   These changes were shown to mask the otherwise expected decrease in average(1)J(CH) for the R-agostic methyl in [Cp2TiMe](+). The difference between the Ti-Me (1)J(CH) values in 1 (111 Hz) and isolobal Cp2TiMe2 (124 Hz) was also attributed to differences in Ti center electrophilicity. The experimental high-field-shifted Si-29 NMR resonance in 7(+) was well reproduced in the DFT-computed beta-Si-C agostic structure, and upper and lower limits for the strength of the agostic interaction were estimated. An NBO analysis of the Ti-CH2SiMe3 bonding found several different contributions, including negative hyperconjugation (population of sigma*(Si-beta-C-gamma)) and formal C-alpha-Si-beta -> Ti and Si-beta-C-gamma -> Ti bond pair donation.

TI Palliative biliary stents for obstructing pancreatic carcinoma
SO COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB Background
   Palliative endoscopic stents or surgical by-pass are often required for inoperable pancreatic carcinoma to relieve symptomatic obstruction of the distal biliary tree. The optimal method of intervention remains unknown.
   Objectives
   To compare surgery, metal endoscopic stents and plastic endoscopic stents in the relief of distal biliary obstruction in patients with inoperable pancreatic carcinoma.
   Search strategy
   We searched the databases of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Group specialised register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CancerLit, Current Concepts Database and BIDS (September 2002 to September 2004). The searches were re-run in December 2005 and we are awaiting further details on two trials. Reference lists of articles and published abstracts from UEGW and DDW were hand-searched.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing surgery to endoscopic stenting, endoscopic metal stents to plastic stents, and different types of endoscopic plastic and metal stents, used to relieve obstruction of the distal bile duct in patients with inoperable pancreatic carcinoma.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials.
   Main results
   Twenty-one trials involving 1,454 people were included. Based on meta-analysis, endoscopic stenting with plastic stents appears to be associated with a reduced risk of complications (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45-0.81), but with higher risk of recurrent biliary obstruction prior to death (RR 18.59, 95% CI 5.33-64.86) when compared with surgery. There was a trend towards higher 30-day mortality in the surgical group (p=0.07, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32, 1.04). There was no evidence of a difference in technical or therapeutic success. Other outcomes were not suitable for meta-analysis. No trials comparing endoscopic metal stents to surgery were identified.
   In endoscopic stent comparisons, metal biliary stents appear to have a lower risk of recurrent biliary obstruction than plastic stents (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39-0.69). There was no significant statistical difference in technical success, therapeutic success, complications or 30-day mortality using meta-analysis. A narrative review of studies of the cost-effectiveness of metal stents drew conflicting conclusions, but results may be dependent on the patients' length of survival.
   Neither Teflon, hydrourethane, or hydrophilic coating appear to improve the patency of plastic stents above polyethylene in the trials reviewed. Only perflouro alkoxy plastic stents had superior outcome to polyethylene stents in one trial. The single eligible trial comparing types of metal stents reported higher patency with covered stents, but also a higher risk of complications. These results are based on review of the trials individual results only.
   Authors' conclusions
   Endoscopic metal stents are the intervention of choice at present in patients with malignant distal obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic carcinoma. In patients with short predicted survival, their patency benefits over plastic stents may not be realised. Further RCTs are needed to determine the optimal stent type for these patients.

AB During high frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV) small tidal volumes are delivered at fast frequencies, usually between 10 and 15 Hz. Meta-analysis of randomised trials of prophylactic HFOV versus conventional ventilation have demonstrated only a modest reduction in BPD amongst survivors in the HFOV groups. Similarly, no long term advantages of HFOV have been highlighted when it is used as rescue mode, but there have been few randomised studies. During liquid ventilation, the lungs are filled with perfluorocarbon, which, compared to water, has low surface tension and a high solubility for respiratory gases. Clinical experience of liquid ventilation is limited, but improvements in oxygenation and lung function have been shown in short term studies. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SP Amer Contact Dermatitis Soc
AB Background: Contact dermatitis (CD) is a common Occupational disease. There have been no systematic reviews of CD treatment or prevention.
   Methods: Multiple databases were systematically searched. Using independent double review and published quality review criteria, articles were rated as good, fair, or poor. Treatment benefit data were tabulated and conclusions were based on the rated strength of published evidence.
   Results: In all, 49 studies met inclusion criteria. Barrier creams containing dimethicone or perfluoropolyethers, cotton liners, and softened fabrics prevent irritant CD. Lipid-rich moisturizers both prevent and treat irritant CD. Topical skin protectant and quatenium 18 bentonite (organoclay) prevent thus dermatitis. Diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (chelator) cream prevents nickel, chrome, and copper dermatitis. Potent or moderately potent steroids effectively treat allergic CD. There were no macrolicle immunomodulator trials that met inclusion criteria. This review did not include studies of children, animals, or non-English language publications.
   Conclusions: A limited number of interventions effectively prevent or treat irritant and allergic CD, but well-controlled, outcome-blinded studies, particularly in the area of allergic CD prevention are needed.

TI 3-nitrobenzanthrone, a potential human cancer hazard in diesel exhaust
   and urban air pollution: a review of the evidence
SO MUTAGENESIS
CT 27th Annual Meeting of the United-Kingdom-Environmental-Mutagen-Society
CY JUL 05, 2004
CL Loughborough, ENGLAND
SP United Kingdom Environm Mutagen Soc
AB Epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to diesel exhaust and urban air pollution is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. 3-Nitrobenzanthrone [3-nitro-7H-benz[de]anthracen-7-one (3-NBA)] is an extremely potent mutagen and suspected human carcinogen identified in diesel exhaust and ambient air particulate matter. The main metabolite of 3-NBA, 3-aminobenzanthrone (3-ABA), was found in the urine of salt mine workers occupationally exposed to diesel emissions, indicating that human exposure to 3-NBA due to diesel emissions can be significant and is detectable. There is clear evidence that 3-NBA is a genotoxic mutagen forming DNA adducts after metabolic activation through simple reduction of the nitro group. Several human enzymes have been shown to activate 3-NBA and its metabolites in vitro and in cells to form electrophilic arylnitrenium and rearranged carbenium ions, leading to the formation of purine adducts at the C8 and N-2 position of guanine and at the C8 and N-6 position of adenine. The predominant DNA adducts in vivo, 2-(2'-deoxyguanosin-N-2-yl)-3-aminobenzanthrone and N-(2'-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-3-aminobenzanthrone are also the most persistent adducts in target tissue in rodents, and are most probably responsible for the induction of GC -> TA transversion mutations observed in vivo. It is concluded that these adducts not only represent premutagenic lesions in DNA but are of primary importance for the initiation of the carcinogenic process and subsequent tumour formation in target tissue. Indeed, 3-NBA is carcinogenic in rats after intratracheal instillation, inducing mainly squamous cell carcinoma in lung. The intention of this article is to provide a critical review on the potential genotoxic effects of 3-NBA on human health. However, in general, there is a need for more mechanistic studies that relate 3-NBA to all processes that are considered to orchestrate tumour development and of studies on the ability of particles to promote 3-NBA genotoxicity. Because of its widespread environmental presence, 3-NBA may represent not only an occupational health hazard but also a hazard for larger sections of the general population. For an accurate risk assessment more epidemiological studies on 3-NBA-exposed individuals and a broader monitoring of environmental levels of 3-NBA are required.

TI Preventing neural tube defects in Europe: A missed opportunity

CT 33rd Annual Conference of the European-Teratology-Society (ETS)
CY SEP 03-07, 2005
CL Haarlem, NETHERLANDS
SP European Teratol Soc
AB Each year, more than 4500 pregnancies in the European Union are affected by neural tube defects (NTD). Unambiguous evidence of the effectiveness of peri conceptional folic acid in preventing the majority of neural tube defects has been available since 1991. We report on trends in the total prevalence of neural tube defects up to 2002, in the context of a survey in 18 European countries of periconceptional folic acid supplementation (PFAS) policies and their implementation. EUROCAT is a network of population-based registries in Europe collaborating in the epidemiological surveillance of congenital anomalies. Representatives from 18 participating countries provided information about policy, health education campaigns and surveys of PFAS uptake. The yearly total prevalence of neural tube defects including livebirths, stillbirths and terminations of pregnancy was calculated from 1980 to 2002 for 34 registries, with UK and Ireland estimated separately from the rest of Europe. A meta-analysis of changes in NTD total prevalence between 1989-1991 and 2000-2002 according to PFAS policy was undertaken for 24 registries. By 2005, 13 countries had a government recommendation that women planning a pregnancy should take 0.4 mg folic acid supplement daily, accompanied in 7 countries by government-led health education initiatives. In the UK and Ireland, countries with PFAS policy, there was a 30% decline in NTD total prevalence (95% CI 16-42%) but it was difficult to distinguish this from the pre-existing strong decline. In other European countries with PFAS policy, there was virtually no decline in NTD total prevalence whether a policy was in place by 1999 (2%, 95% CI 28% reduction to 32% increase) or not (8%, 95% CI 26% reduction to 16% increase). The potential for preventing NTDs by periconceptional folic acid supplementation is still far from being fulfilled in Europe. Only a public health policy including folic acid fortification of staple foods is likely to result in large-scale prevention of NTDs. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Endobiliary stents for palliation in patients with malignant obstructive
   jaundice
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB Background: Endobiliary drainage for malignant obstructive jaundice presents a viable palliative alternative. Its role and efficacy depend on factors related to the stent, procedure, and patient.
   Goals: To review the evidence in the literature in which settings plastic or metal stents are cost-effective, and whether adjuvant measures or patient-related factors affect duration of stent patency.
   Study: Using databases a literature search was performed for papers published from 1979 to April 2004. All retrieved papers reporting experimental or clinical observations were rated according to strength of evidence, and carefully analyzed.
   Results and Conclusions: Metal stents (Wallstent) stay patent longer than plastic stents (large-bore polyethylene with side-holes), overall median 250 and 110 days, respectively, and seem cost-effective in patients with longer than about 6 months survival, which cannot be accurately predicted. Antibiotics or choleretic agents do not prolong stent patency in clinical settings. In case of stent occlusion, indicated stent exchanges and insertion of a plastic stent, respectively, seem cost-effective in patients initially treated with plastic and metal stents.

TI Modem and historical fluxes of halogenated organic contaminants to a
   lake in the Canadian arctic, as determined from annually laminated
   sediment cores
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Two annually laminated cores collected from Lake DV09 on Devon Island in May 1999 were dated using Pb-210 and Cs-137, and analyzed for a variety of halogenated organic contaminants (HOCs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, short-chain polychlormated n-alkanes (sPCAs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Dry weight HOC concentrations in Lake DV09 sediments were generally similar to other remote Arctic lakes. Maximum HOC fluxes often agreed well with production maxima, although many compound groups exhibited maxima at or near the sediment surface, much later than peak production. The lower than expected HOC concentrations in older sediment slices may be due to anaerobic degradation and possibly to dilution resulting from a temporary increase in sedimentation rate observed between the mid-1960s and 1970s. Indeed, temporal trends were more readily apparent for those compound classes when anaerobic metabolites were also analyzed, such as for DDT and toxaphene. However, it is postulated here for the first time that the maximum or increasing HOC surface fluxes observed for many of the major compound classes in DV09 sediments may be influenced by climate variation and the resulting increase in algal primary productivity which could drive an increasing rate of HOC scavenging from the water column. Both the fraction (F-TC) and enantiomer fraction (EF) of trans-chlordane (TC) decreased significantly between 1957 and 1997, suggesting that recent inputs to the lake are from weathered chlordane sources. PCDD/Fs showed a change in sources from pentachlorophenol (PeCP) in the 1950s and 1960s to combustion sources into the 1990s. Improvements in combustion technology may be responsible for the reducing the proportion of TCDF relative to OCDD in the most recent slice. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Long-term integrity of Teflon felt-supported suture lines in aortic
   surgery
SO ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY
AB Background. Although the ultimate success of aortic operations depends upon the integrity of graft-to-aorta anastomoses, little is known about different techniques used to assure their longevity. We report the incidence of reoperation for suture line disruptions arising from anastomoses using reinforcement with Teflon felt.
   Methods. Since 1987, 1475 patients underwent 2281 anastomoses in the thoracic aorta (mean 1.55/anastomoses per patient). All patients were followed with at least yearly computed tomographic scans, for a total follow-up of 6483.8 patient-years. Those requiring reoperation were reviewed retrospectively for evidence of suture line disruption.
   Results. Only 34 patients, with a mean age of 55.1 years old (range 26-85 years old) underwent reoperation for suture-line disruptions following vascular graft-to-aorta anastomosis using Teflon felt. The previous operation was a Bentall procedure in 15 (44%); ascending aorta replacement in 9 (26%); total arch replacement in 6 (18%); descending aorta replacement in 2 (6%); thoracoabdominal repair in 1 (3%); and sinus of Valsalva repair in 1 3(%). The incidence of suture line disruption was 0.0052 per patient-year, and 0.0034 per anastomosis-year. The mean interval between operations was 55.9 months (range 4-180 months). In 21%, the pseudoaneurysm originated from the proximal anastomosis; in 71% from the distal anastomosis; in 3% from both; in 3% from the innominate artery; and in 3% from a sinus of Valsalva repair. In only 1 patient was there evidence of infection. Reoperation involved ascending aorta replacement in 11 patients, and total arch replacement in 13 patients. Adverse outcome, such as hospital death or permanent stroke, occurred in 8% (3 patients).
   Conclusions. Use of Teflon felt to support aortic suture lines yields a very low incidence of suture line disruptions: 1 per 191 patient-years, or 1 per 296 anastomosis-years. Teflon felt reinforcement provides a secure, longlasting graft-to-aorta anastomosis with minimal risk of infection.

AB Diffusional-viscosimetric analysis of liquid crystal metallocomplexes of holmium and dysprosium with 4-alkoxy-N-alkyl-2-hydroxybenzaldiimines in the protonated (zwitterionic) form and various counterions demonstrated that the complexes of the lanthanides with perfluoroalkylsulfate anions have hydrodynamic sizes half those of the complexes with nitrate anions, with the type of lanthanide having virtually no effect on the size of the complex. The results correlate with the geometric size of the ligand and the parameters of the mesophase and crystal lattice of the complex.

AB The NASA New Millennium Program's Geosynchronous Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (GIFTS) instrument provides enormous advances in water vapor, wind, temperature, and trace gas profiling from geostationary orbit. The top-level instrument calibration requirement is to measure brightness temperature to better than I K (3 sigma) over a broad range of atmospheric brightness temperatures, with a reproducibility of 0.2 K. For in-flight radiometric calibration, GIFTS uses views of two on-board blackbody sources (290 K and 255 K) along with cold space, sequenced at regular programmable intervals. The blackbody references are cavities that follow the UW Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI) design, scaled to the GIFTS beam size. The cavity spectral emissivity is better than 0.998 with an absolute uncertainty of less than 0.001. Absolute blackbody temperature uncertainties are estimated at 0.07 K. This paper describes the detailed design of the GIFTS on-board calibration system that recently underwent its Critical Design Review. The blackbody cavities use ultra-stable thermistors to measure temperature, and are coated with high emissivity black paint. Monte Carlo modeling has been performed to calculate the cavity emissivity. Both absolute temperature and emissivity measurements are traceable to NIST, and detailed uncertainty budgets have been developed and used to show the overall system meets accuracy requirements. The blackbody controller is housed on a single electronics board and provides precise selectable set point temperature control, thermistor resistance measurement, and the digital interface to the GIFTS instrument. Plans for the NIST traceable ground calibration of the on-board blackbody system have also been developed and are presented in this paper.

TI Studies on intercorrelation between selected persistent organic

   Baltic Sea, Gdansk Bay region
SO POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed brackish sea with only limited water exchange with the North Sea and, thus, the North Atlantic. This salty water reservoir with water residence time of approximately 25 years is contaminated with many inorganic and organic pollutants: VOCl (Volatile Organohalogen Compounds), HC (Petrolcuin Hydrocarbons), OPNP (Organophosphorus and Organonitrogenous Pesticides), OCP (Organochlorine Pesticides), PAH (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) and heavy metals. Our paper presents monitoring results and sea environmental pollution assessment of the Southern Baltic coastal zone- the area of the Gdansk Bay, based on the analysis of sea water samples. A set of various analytes were determined: PAH (16 analytes), VOCl (6 analytes), HC (9 analytes), OPNP (8 analytes), OCP (5 analytes), heavy metals (Zn, Cd, Ph, Cu). The results were subjected to full statistical evaluation. An assessment of sea environment contamination was made by characterization of pollution sources and the definition of intercorrelations between them. The characterization of major statistically important correlations between 45 variables was performed with the use of principal component analysis technique. From the performed PCA it arose that the factor configuration was similar for all sampling points and in all cases 5 factors explain over 60% of the data variance, and the statistically significant loading factors are higher than 0.7 (with p=0.05). Additionally, analysis of variance and time series analysis were applied to define important differences between chemical species' concentration levels in time and in accordance with sampling points' geographical location. As a result of time series analyses carried through with consideration to sampling points, there were no statistically important differences discovered in trends of changes from 1996 up to 1999 for any of examined groups of compounds.

AB A method of extraction-separation of Fe(II), Fe(III) and Cu(II) under pseudo three-phase equilibrium using a filter-paper phase separator with high speed stirring was examined. Under the optimum conditions, Cu(II) and Fe(III) were extracted into a dithizone-chloroform phase and an 8-quinolinol-chloroform phase, respectively, leaving Fe(II) in the water phase. Concentrated metal ions were analyzed quantitatively by means of an optical absorption spectrometer. At, low concentrations, the metal ions were back-extracted with 5M nitric acid solution from the organic phases, and analyzed quantitatively with an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). The results showed that it is possible to separate Fe(II) of not less than 1.5ppb, Fe(III) of not less than 1ppb and Cu(II) of not less than 1ppb from the mixture if this method is employed. When the rate of transport of the liquid from one flask to another was adjusted to be 2ml/min, 120 minutes were needed for this extraction-separation procedure, and according to this method, it was possible to determine the ratio of Fe(II) to Fe(III) in both tap water and well water. It is interesting to notice that Fe(II), which is easily oxidized by dissolved oxygen, co-exists in drinking water where the pH is 5-7. It was presumed that total organic carbon had some influence on this fact.

TI Spreading and dewetting in nanoscale lubrication
SO TRIBOLOGY LETTERS
AB This article critically reviews the fundamental scientific tools, as well as constructs cohesive schemes for potential applications, relevant to the molecularly-thin liquid film technology. Our focus is to understand the nanoscale dynamic behavior of thin lubricant films, relevant to the emerging field of nanotechnology, especially for achieving durability and reliability in the nanoscale devices. Our goal is to present a unifed and hybrid description of perfluoropolyether (PFPE) experiment, mesoscopic interpretation, microscopic simulation tools, and molecular design tools available up to now. The experimentation and theory for the physicochemical properties of ultra-thin PFPE films are used to examine liquid film in the sub-monolayer to multilayer regime. Methods for extracting spreading properties from the scanning microellipsometry (SME) for various PFPE/solid surface pairs and the surface rheological characterization of PFPEs are examined. The interrelationships among SME spreading pro. files, rheology, surface energy, and tribology, are given. Mesoscopic theories, including thermodynamics of evaporation and flow, stability analysis, microscale mass transfer, and capillary waves are introduced to describe thin PFPE film dynamics. Estimation of thin film viscosity enhancement from vapor pressure suppression by dispersion force is reviewed. The method for experimental derivation of lubricant spreading profiles from contact angles is summarized. The implications of capillary waves, or thermal fluctuations, at the surface of polymeric lubricant films are also discussed. The lattice-based, simple reactive sphere Monte Carlo (MC) technique for examining the fundamentals of PFPE dynamics is illustrated. An off-lattice based bead-spring MC model is also introduced to capture a detailed internal structure of the PFPE molecules, and the molecular dynamics method is implemented for a full-scale nanostructural analysis of PFPE ultra-thin films. By systematically tuning the endgroup strengths of PFPE, we examined the physicochemical properties for thin liquid films of the various PFPE/ solid surface pairings. These tools accurately describe the static and dynamic behavior of ultra- thin liquid films consistent with experimental findings and thus are suitable for examining the fundamental mechanisms of lubrication in nanoscale devices. Application of the next generation head-disk interface design in information storage device is briefly considered.

AB Peptides modified with fluoroalkyl functions in key backbone positions have been scarcely studied so far. Thus, little is known about their synthesis, their structural and physico-chemical properties, and their biological features. Our interest in this field of research led to the development of stereocontrolled synthetic protocols, both in solution and in solid phase, for many different fluoroalkyl peptidomimetics, some of which are overviewed in this paper: (a) psi[CH(CF3)NH]-peptide mimics holding a great potential as hybrids between natural peptides and hydrolytic transition state analogs; (b) trifluoromethyl (Tfm) malic peptidomimetics as micromolar inhibitors of some matrix metalloproteinases; (c) bis-Tfm analogs of Pepstatin A, that are nanomolar and selective inhibitors of the protozoal aspartyl protease Plasmepsin II.

TI Elemental composition of springtime aerosol in Chillan, Chile
SO ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
CT 4th Colloquium on PM and Human Health
CY MAR 31-APR 04, 2003
CL Pittsburgh, PA
AB An aerosol monitoring study was established to measure ambient aerosol composition and study air pollution for one sampling site located at the University of Concepcion, Chillan Campus. Chillan, a typical agricultural city in the central valley, is located in the southern Bio Bio Region of Chile. The Chillan Campus is located approximately 4 km north of the city's downtown. The aerosol monitor operated on the campus from 9 October to 9 December, 1998. The study employed an IMPROVE sampler with an Anderson PM10 inlet at 3 m collecting PM10 on 25 mm. Teflon membrane filters. The filters were weighed before and after sampling to obtain mass concentration, then proton induced X-ray emission and X-ray fluorescence analysis were used to measure the concentration of 22 elements to levels below 0.68 ng/m(3). Moderate aerosol concentration was observed (up to 116 mug/m(3)). The main aerosol particle source in Chillan is resuspended soil dust, which accounts for 55% of the PM10 aerosol. The presence of Br, Pb and V and other heavy metals in analyzed samples points to traffic emissions in the city. Aerosol associated with transportation activities accounts for 11% of the PM10 mass. Non-transportation organics, associated with hydrogen measured by proton elastic scattering analysis, are an important component accounting for 19% of the PM10 mass. Sulfate particles account for 3%. In addition, presence of several trace metals, including Mn, Zn, Cu, Ga, As, and Sr in our samples suggests the presence of industrial emissions in the city. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Distribution and fractionation of heavy metals in solid waste from
   selected sites in the industrial belt of Delhi, India
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Solid waste samples were collected from five small-scale industrial sites in the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi. These industrial sites represent the regional spread of the industrial belt in the NCT of Delhi. Solid waste samples were digested using aqua-regia and HF in air tight teflon bombs for the quantitative analysis of heavy metals (Hg, Pb, Cd, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu and Zn) by GBC model 902 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Hg was analysed using hydrid generator attachment. Beside this sequential extraction was used to fractionate five heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cd, Cu and Zn) into six operationally defined phases, viz. water soluble, exchangeable, carbonate-bound, Fe-Mn oxides, organic-bound and residual fractions to ascertain the relative mobility of these metals. The result obtained showed metal concentration to be in the range of Hg 0.42-2.3; Pb 23-530; Cd 0.14-224; Mn 494-19 964; Fe 35 684-233 119; Ni 192-1534; Cu 3065-10 144 and Zn 116-23 321 (all units in mg kg(-1)) in all the industrial areas studied. The fractionated toxic metals like Pb, Ni and Cd were observed to be in the range of 25-35, 15-50 and 40-50%, respectively, in mobile or bio-available fractions of solid waste. As this waste is often disposed-off by the roadsides, low lying areas, abandoned quarries or in landfill sites which are often not properly planned, thus posing potential risk to ground and surface water quality to millions of people living downstream.

TI Comparison of samplers for the biological characterization of the sea
   surface microlayer
SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS
AB The surface film of the hydrosphere covers more than 70% of the world's surface. The sea surface microlayer (SML) or "skin" of the ocean is a sink for natural and anthropogenic material originating from the atmosphere and the water column. Organisms living in this SML are called "neuston." Our knowledge of the biology of the SML is still in its infancy. Research of the sea surface microlayer requires the use of appropriate sampling techniques and strategies, and the question of what is the most suitable device has not yet been answered. In the present study, we have compared the efficiency of the Harvey glass plate ( GP) and the Garrett metal screen ( MS) to analyze a wide range of microbiological parameters in SML samples collected at two coastal stations in the NW Mediterranean Sea. Two types of membranes ( Teflon and polycarbonate) were also used to collect bacterioneuston. The MS was the most appropriate technique for most biological parameters providing higher enrichment factors as compared to the GP and, therefore, the highest enrichment factors compared with underlying waters (UW). Control experiments with UW demonstrated that the enrichment reported for the MS was not biased by any selectivity of the sampler itself. Therefore, we recommend the use of the MS when the aim is to compare different biological parameters. In contrast, there is clear evidence that hydrophobic and hydrophilic membranes have an important drawback and should not be used for quantification purposes.

TI Structure and dynamics in a bis(perfluoroalkyl)triazapentadiene
   methylmercury compound
SO ORGANOMETALLICS
AB The compound [Ph2N3C2(C3F7)(2)]HgCH3 was synthesized from Na[Ph2N3C2(C3F7)(2)] and CH3HgCl. In solution, it exists as a mixture of two isomers that interconvert slowly on the NMR time scale. Both isomers feature a eta(1)-Ph2N3C2(C3F7)(2) ligand. In the asymmetrical one, the CH3Hg group is bonded to one of the two terminal nitrogen atoms. In the more stable symmetrical isomer, [PhN=C(C3F7)](2)NHgCH3, mercury is attached to the central nitrogen atom. It is this isomer that crystallizes and that was characterized by X-ray diffraction. Thermodynamic parameters for the CH3Hg shift reaction were obtained by DNMR spectroscopy. F-19 NMR spectra were analyzed. A metallotropic rearrangement was not observed in [Ph2N3C2(C3F7)(2)]AuPPh3.

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
AB Laboratory and on-orbit performance data for two common thermal control materials, silver- and aluminum-backed (metallized) fluorinated ethyl-propylene, were collected from a variety of sources and analyzed. It is demonstrated that the change in solar absorptance alpha is a strong function of particulate radiation for these materials. Examination of additional data shows that the atomic-oxygen recession rate is a strong function of solar exposure with an induction period of between 25 to 50 equivalent solar hours. The relationships determined in this analysis were incorporated into an electronic knowledge base, the "Spacecraft Materials Selector," under NASA Contract NAS8-98213. This tool is available from the NASA Space Environments and Effects program office.

TI Development of a new radioligand,
   N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl-5-methoxybenzyl)acet
   amide, for PET imaging of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in primate
   brain
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB To develop a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for imaging the 'peripheral benzodiazepine receptor' (PBR) in brain and elucidating the relationship between PBR and brain diseases, four analogues (4-7) of N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide (2) were synthesized and evaluated as ligands for PBR. Of these compounds, fluoromethyl (4) and fluoroethyl (5) analogues had similar or higher affinities for PBR than the parent compound 2 (K-i = 0.16 nM for PBR in rat brain sections). Iodomethyl analogue 6 displayed a moderate affinity, whereas tosyloxyethyl analogue 7 had weak affinity. Radiolabeling was performed for the fluoroalkyl analogues 4 and 5 using fluorine-18 (F-18, beta(+); 96.7%, T-1/2 = 109.8 min). Ligands [F-18]4 and [F-18]5 were respectively synthesized by the alkylation of desmethyl precursor 3 with [F-18]fluoromethyl iodide ([F-18]8) and 2-[F-18]fluoroethyl bromide ([F-18]9). The distribution patterns of [F-18]4 and [F-18]5 in mice were consistent with the known distribution of PBR. However, compared with [F-18]5, [F-18]4 displayed a high uptake in the bone of mice. The PET image of [F-18]4 for monkey brain also showed significant radioactivity in the bone, suggesting that this ligand was unstable for in vivo defluorination and was not a useful PET ligand. Ligand [F-18]5 displayed a high uptake in monkey brain especially in the occipital cortex, a region with richer PBR than the other regions in the brain. The radioactivity level of [F-18]5 in monkey brain was 1.5 times higher than that of [C-11]2, and 6 times higher than that of (R)-(1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-[C-11]methyl,N-(1-methylpropyl)isoquinoline ([C-11]1). Moreover, the in vivo binding of [F-18]5 was significantly inhibited by PBR-selective 2 or 1, indicating that the binding of [F-18]5 in the monkey brain was mainly due to PBR. Metabolite analysis revealed that [F-18]4 was rapidly metabolized by defluorination to [F-18]F- in the plasma and brain of mice, whereas [F-18]5 was metabolized by debenzylation to a polar product [F-18]13 only in the plasma. No radioactive metabolite of [F-18]5 was detected in the mouse brain. The biological data indicate that [F-18]5 is a useful PET ligand for PBR and is currently used for imaging PBR in human brain.

TI Transcriptional analysis of spo0A overexpression in Clostridium
   acetobutylicum and its effect on the cell's response to butanol stress
SO JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY
AB Spo0A is the regulator of stationary-phase events and is required for transcription of solvent formation genes in Clostridium acetobutylicum. In order to elucidate the role of spo0A in differentiation, we performed transcriptional analysis of 824(pMSPOA) (a spo0A-overexpressing C acetobutylicum strain with enhanced sporulation) against a plasmid control strain. DNA microarray data were contrasted to data from a spo0A knockout strain (SKO1) that neither sporulates nor produces solvents. Transcripts of fatty acid metabolism genes, motility and chemotaxis genes, heat shock protein genes, and genes encoding the Fts family of cell division proteins were differentially expressed in the two strains, suggesting that these genes play roles in sporulation and the solvent stress response. 824(pMSPOA) alone showed significant downregulation of many glycolytic genes in stationary phase, which is consistent with metabolic flux analysis data. Surprisingly, spo0A overexpression resulted in only nominal transcriptional changes of regulatory genes (abrB and sigF) whose expression was significantly altered in SKO1. Overexpression of spo0A imparted increased tolerance and prolonged metabolism in response to butanol stress. While most of the differentially expressed genes appear to be part of a general stress response (similar to patterns in two plasmid control strains and a groESL-overexpressing strain), several genes were expressed at higher levels at early time points after butanol challenge only in 824(pMSPOA). Most of these genes were related to butyryl coenzyme A and butyrate formation and/or assimilation, but they also included the cell division gene ftsX, the gyrase subunit-encoding genes gyrB and gyrA, DNA synthesis and repair genes, and fatty acid synthesis genes, all of which might play a role in the immediate butanol stress response, and thus in enhanced butanol tolerance.

TI Isotopic and ion-exchange kinetics in the Nafion-117 membrane
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB The exchange kinetics of Cs+, Cu2+, and Eu3+ ions in Nafion-117 were measured at different HI ion concentrations in equilibrating salt solutions. The exchange kinetics were found to be independent of the H+ ion concentration in equilibrating salt solutions over the pH range of 5-2. The exchange kinetics were therefore used to evaluate self-diffusion coefficients of the metal ions using an analytical solution of Fick's second law. The self-diffusion coefficient of Cs+ in Nafion-117 was found to be in agreement with the value obtained in our earlier work (1.94 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1)) based on the isotopic-exchange method in the absence of HI ions. This further confirmed that the exchange process in the Nafion-117 membrane represents the pure isotopic exchange in the said pH range. The self-diffusion coefficients of Cu2+ and Eu3+ were found to be 2.9 x 10(-7) and 4.5 x 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1), respectively. The smaller self-diffusion coefficient of Eu3+ reflects its increased electrostatic interaction with the membrane matrix. The kinetics of forward (H-(m)(+) = M-(s)(n+)) and reverse (M-(m)(n+) = H-(s)(+)) exchanges of metal ions (Cs+, Cu2+, and Eu3+) in the Nafion-117 membrane were also studied. The Nernst-Planck theory was examined to predict the kinetics of these exchanges. The theory was found to be reasonably accurate for predicting the kinetics of the reverse ion exchange but completely failed for the forward ion exchange. Contrary to the prediction of the theory, the kinetics of forward exchanges of Cs+, Cu2+, and Eu3+ with H+ ions in the Nafion- 117 membrane were found to be independent of the metal ions. This shows that the self-diffusion coefficients of the counterions in Nafion- 117 can be obtained only from the analysis of reverse exchange kinetics based on the Nernst-Planck equation.

TI Ligand-exchange detection of phosphorylated peptides using liquid
   chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is used to selectively detect analytes with a high affinity for metal ions. The detection method is based on the selective monitoring of a competing ligand at its specific m/z value that is released during the ligand-exchange reaction of a metal-ligand complex with analyte(s) eluting from a reversed-phase liquid chromatography column. The ligand-exchange reaction proceeds in a postcolumn reaction detection system placed prior to the inlet of the electrospray MS interface. The feasibility of metal affinity detection by ESI-MS is demonstrated using phosphorylated peptides and iron(III)methylcalcein blue as reactant, as a model system. Methylcalcein blue (MCB) released upon interaction with phosphorylated peptides is detected at m/z 278. The ligand-exchange detection is coupled to a C8 reversed-phase column to separate several nonphosphorylated enkephalins and the phosphorylated peptides pp60 c-src (P) and M2170. Detection limits of 2 muM were obtained for pp60 c-src (P) and M2170. The linearity of the detection method is tested in the range of 2-80 mumol/L phosphorylated compounds (r(2) = 0.9996), and a relative standard deviation of less than 8% (n = 3) for all MCB responses of the different concentrations of phosphorylated compounds was obtained. The presented method showed specificity for phosphorylated peptides and may prove a useful tool for studying other ligand-exchange reactions and metal-protein interactions.

TI Systematic review: Efficacy of silicone microimplants (Macroplastique

SO EUROPEAN UROLOGY
AB Objective: To assess the efficacy of silicone microimplants (Macroplastique((R)); polydimethylsiloxane) therapy for stress urinary incontinence in adult women, using a systematic review of identified studies.
   Materials and Methods: A computer-aided and manual search for published studies investigating silicone microimplants therapy for stress urinary incontinence in adult women. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using criteria based on generally accepted principles of interventional research.
   Results: Only two RCTs, only published as an abstract, were found. Eleven pre-experimental or observational studies were identified. Overall, the methodological quality was low. The main methodological shortcomings of the studies were: no random allocation procedure, lack of prestratification on prognostic determinants, no blinding, small sample sizes, and lack of proper analysis and presentation of results. There was variability in the indication for implantation, implantation procedure, rate and volume of silicone microimplants. The use of different. outcome measures in most of the trials made comparison between studies difficult.
   Conclusions: Because of the low methodological quality of included studies, results should be interpreted with caution and no firm conclusions about the efficacy of silicone microimplants were possible. Randomized clinical trials, using valid and reliable subjective and objective measurements, are necessary to establish the efficacy of silicone microimplants therapy in treating stress urinary incontinence in adult women.

   AND LIFE SCIENCES
AB Oxaliplatin ([(1R,2R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine-N,N']oxalato(2-)-O,O'-platinum) is the first platinum drug with significant activity for metastatic colon cancer. The analysis of oxaliplatin has previously almost exclusively been based on the determination of the platinum content in plasma or ultrafiltrate using flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). A new method for quantitative determination of the free fraction of the intact drug in blood ultrafiltrate is presented here. Blood was ultrafiltrated centripetally at 4 degreesC and the ultrafiltrate was analyzed by liquid chromatography. Oxaliplatin was separated on a Hypercarb column using a mobile phase of methanol/succinic acid buffer pH 7.0 (9/1, v/v). Post-column derivatization was performed by adding N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate in methanol and with microwave heating of a Teflon tubing. The derivative was quantified by photometric detection at 344 nm. The coefficient of variation of standard blood samples was 4.9 and 2.5% at 0.100 and 1.00 mug/ml, respectively. The limit of quantitation was 0.04 mug/ml. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Peripheral parenteral nutrition
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB Background: Peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) currently accounts for almost 20 per cent of all parenteral nutrition administered in the UK. In the absence of consensus guidelines there is wide variation in practice. Heterogeneity of clinical trials has made direct comparisons difficult and meta-analysis impossible.
   Methods: Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched for all clinical trials relating to the use of PPN in adults. Relevant papers from the reference fists of these articles and from the authors' personal collections were also reviewed.
   Results and conclusions: Effective PPN is possible in about 50 per cent of inpatients requiring parenteral nutrition. Evidence relating to optimal feed composition, choice of cannula, infusion technique and pharmacological manipulation is discussed, along with practical recommendations for the administration of PPN.

TI Tribological characteristics and tribochemical reactions of various
   ceramics lubricated with HFC-134a gas
SO TRIBOLOGY LETTERS
AB The role of tribochemical products in the friction and wear reduction of ceramics with different fractional ionic character in CF3CH2F (HFC-134a) gas was investigated using a ball-on-disk type tribometer. Without exposure to air, the wear tracks on the disks were characterized with the aid of a micro-spot X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscope (XPS) whose analytical chamber was connected to the friction chamber of the tribometer. Further, the adsorption and desorption behaviors of HFC-134a molecules on the nascent surfaces of the ceramics were studied using an adsorption test apparatus in high vacuum. It was found that the lubricating effect of HFC-134a gas was closely related to the fractional ionic or covalent characters of the ceramics. HFC-134a gas was more effective in lubricating ionic ceramics than the covalent ceramics. XPS analysis revealed that metal fluorides were mainly formed on the frictional surfaces of the ionic ceramics, whereas the composition of the tribochemical products on the frictional surfaces of the other ceramics was complicated. The adsorption tests proved that HFC-134a was decomposed to an olefin CF2 = CHF on the nascent surfaces of the ionic ceramic Al2O3 and the covalent ceramics. However, the formation of organic fluorine-containing compounds was not detected on the frictional surfaces of the ionic ceramics by XPS. This result implies that the mechanism of tribochemical reactions is strongly dependent on the bond type of ceramics. It is concluded that the low friction and wear of the ionic ceramics in HFC-134a gas result from the metal fluorides formed with high surface concentration on the sliding surfaces.

TI Recent advances on radical nucleophilic substitution reactions
SO CURRENT ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The radical nucleophilic substitution mechanism or SRNI is a Chain process, in which radicals and radical anions are intermediates. This process has been extensively used to effect substitution on a wide variety of substrates, The SRNI reaction has been studied from both mechanistic and synthetic standpoints.
   The SRNI mechanism requires an initiation step. Spontaneous electron transfer (ET) from the nucleophile to then substrate substrate has been observed in a few systems, light stimulation, electrodes, alkali metals or inoroanic salt-mediation is used otherwise.
   There are systems that are totally inert,or undergo rather slow substitutions by classical polar mechanisms . Their lack of reactivity is usually due to strain (cycloalkyl and polycycloalkyl halides), steric (cycloalkyl, polycycloalkyl and neopentyl halides). Or electronic factors (unactivated aromatic, vinyl halides and perfluoroalkyl halides). For these families of compounds, the nucleophilic substitution can be accomplished by the SRNI mechanism. Conversely, there is a class of substrates, for which substitution can be achieved through both polar and ET mechanisms; however, the ET pathway is favored in some systems (i.e.: alkyl halides with EWG).
   We propose to undertake a compilation and critical review of SRNI reactions dealing with substitutions on aromatic substrates, cycloalkyl, bridgehead, neopentyl, vinyl halies, perfluroalkyl iodides, aliphatic substrates with EWG in the alpha position and and N,N-dialkyl-p-toluenesulfonamides. With the aim in mind, we expect to cover recent SRNI substitutions, with an emphasis on the scope of the process in terms of synthetic capability and target applications.

SO ADSORPTION AND AGGREGATION OF SURFACTANTS IN SOLUTION
SE Surfactant Science Series
CT 13th International Symposium on Surfactants in Solution
CY JUN 11-16, 2000
CL Gainesville, FL
AB The uses of fluorosurfactants to stabilize water-in-carbon dioxide (w/c) microemulsions are reviewed. A systematic study with fluorosuccinate surfactants of the effects of the extent of fluorination of hydrophobic chains on the stability and structures of these w/c phases is described. Therefore, it has been possible to delineate a structure-function relationship for these fluorosurfactants with reference to their efficiency of water-in-carbon dioxide microemulsion formation. An important finding is that one of these surfactants, namely sodium bis(1H,1H-perfluoropentyl)-2-sulfosuccinate (di-CF4), is able to stabilize w/c microemulsions close to the bottle pressure of a normal CO2 cylinder. Such efficient surfactants of this kind have obvious advantages for potential practical applications of CO2.

TI Atomization and vaporization of lead from a blood matrix using
   rhodium-coated tungsten filaments with pseudo-simultaneous
   electrothermal atomic absorption and inductively coupled plasma mass
   spectrometric measurements
SO JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY
AB In an effort to understand the pyrolysis and atomization behavior of Pb in a dilute blood matrix when determined using a tungsten filament electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometer (W-filament ETAAS), we directly coupled a W-filament ETAAS instrument (J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 2001, 16, 82) to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). The W-filament instrument was operated both as an electrothermal atomizer (ETA) and as an electrothermal vaporizer (ETV). The experimental arrangement was used to monitor simultaneously the analyte (Pb-208), the permanent modifier (Rh-103) coating the W surface, a surrogate for the organic components of the blood matrix ((ArC)-Ar-40-C-12), and the metal atomizer (W-180,W-183 and (WO)-W-184-O-16), while also measuring Pb by AAS pseudo-simultaneously. Electrothermal parameters used in the ETV/ETA experiments were precisely the same as those described previously (Spectrochim. Acta, Part B, 2002, 57, 727) for ETAAS work. This was necessary in order that the ICP-MS data could be used to observe the vaporization of analyte, matrix, modifier, and metallic atomizer throughout the electrothermal cycle. The purge gas used to transport vaporized material from the atomization cell to the ICP was Ar containing 6% H-2. Pseudo-simultaneous ETAAS and ETV-ICP-MS measurements of Pb in blood were achieved using this experimental arrangement, with the MS signals appearing roughly 2 s after those by AAS, consistent with the delay caused by the 15 cm long Teflon transfer line connecting the two instruments. During pyrolysis, a strong signal observed at mass 52 is shown to be due to (ArC)-Ar-40-C-12; this signal increases as filament power for pyrolysis increases. When plotted, the data show the effective removal of much of the carbon-based matrix during pyrolysis, but without significant loss of analyte. In contrast, the pre-coated permanent modifier, Rh, is only lost during the final cleaning stage of the program in which maximum power is necessary to remove the carbonaceous matrix. However, when Rh is added to the diluent, it is lost even during pyrolysis, and at a much lower temperature. This explains why addition of Rh directly to the diluent yields no modification benefits, and why periodic re-coating of the filament surface for the analysis is necessary.

   sintered alloy
SO JOURNAL OF JAPANESE SOCIETY OF TRIBOLOGISTS
AB The tribological properties of three types of PFPE oils for a bronze-based sintered bearing alloy were examined by using the Falex tester. PFPE oils exhibited a low friction coefficient and a low wear rate compared to a hydrocarbon oil. The friction coefficient of three types of PFPE oils at the initial stage was in the following order, FM15 < DS65 < BJ60, and after 3.6ks this order did not change much. The initial results can be explained by the high reactivity of FM15 with the alloy surface. The XPS analysis revealed that metal fluorides were formed on both the surfaces of the block and the pin after friction tests were carried out.

TI Hydroxylated PCB metabolites and PCBs in serum from pregnant Faroese
   women
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB In the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic, the traditional diet includes pilot whale meat and blubber and other marine food. Fatty fish and blubber of mammals may contain high concentrations of organohalogen substances (OHSs). Elevated levels of OHSs have been reported from the Faroe islands, first documented in breast milk samples obtained in 1987. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in serum samples from pregnant Faroese women known to differ in their dietary habits. High concentrations of OH-PCBs and PCBs were found in part of the human serum samples analyzed, and the relative OH-PCB and PCB congener distributions were similar to those observed elsewhere. There was a wide span between the lowest and highest OH-PCB and PCB concentrations in the serum samples analyzed, with ranges of 19-1,800 ng/g lipid weight (lw) and 150-22,000 ng/g lw, respectively. The ratio of SigmaOH-PCB/SigmaPCB averaged about 10% and varied little. 4-Hydroxy-2,2',3,4',5,5',6-heptachlorobiphenyl was the most abundant OH-PCB metabolite in all samples analyzed, with four other OH-PCB congeners as dominating metabolites in the serum. More than 25 additional OH-PCBs were indicated. This study confirms the presence of high concentrations of organohalogen substances in populations or areas far removed from their sources.

   Chromatography
CY JUN 13-15, 2001
CL ELLECOM, NETHERLANDS
AB The practice and theory of enantioselective complexation GC is comprehensively reviewed for the first time. A multitude of racemic oxygen-, nitrogen- and sulfur-containing selectands can be separated without prior derivatization into enantiomers by complexation GC on optically active metal(II) bis[3-(perfluoroacyl)-(1R)-camphorate] selectors. Peak inversion is obtained when the selectors with opposite configuration are employed. Applications pertain to chiral analysis in asymmetric synthesis, enzymatic reactions, pheromone and flavour chemistry. Although the use of enantioselective complexation GC has diminished recently with the advent of modified cyclodextrins in enantioselective GC, the inherent principles of enantiorecognition together with other enantioselective phenomena can be elucidated easily by complexation GC. Using the concept of the retention-increment R' which allows the distinction between non-enantioselective and enantioselective contributions to retention, concise thermodynamic parameters of enantioselectivity -Delta(D.L)(DeltaG) are accessible. The enantiomerization of configurationally labile enantiomers can be investigated and quantified by complexation GC. Four distinct enantioselective processes and four different coalescence phenomena have been discerned in complexation GC.

TI Recent advances in measurement of Pb isotopes in polar ice and snow at
   sub-picogram per gram concentrations using thermal ionisation mass
   spectrometry
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB Techniques for Pb measurements have reached the stage where Antarctic ice with sub-picogram per gram concentrations can be reliably analysed for isotopic composition. Here, particular attention has been given to measuring the quantity of Pb added during the decontamination and sample storage stages of the sample preparation process because of their impact on accuracy at low concentrations. These stages, including the use of a stainless steel chisel for the decontamination, contributed similar to5.2 pg to the total sample analysed, amounting to a concentration increase of similar to13 fg g(-1), which is significantly less than expected. Consequently, the corrections to the isotopic ratios and concentration were also smaller. Other contributions to the blank, such as Pb fallout onto critical working areas in the HEPA-filtered air laboratories, were also relatively small as was the amount of Pb leached from preconditioned perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) beakers during sample processing. The ion source contributed typically 89 19 fg to the blank. Although this was relatively,large, its influence depended upon the amount of Pb available for analysis and it had the greatest impact when small volumes of samples with a very low concentration were analysed. A 15 months investigation of the leaching characteristics of Pb from a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) sample storage bottle showed 11 fg cm(-2) per day was released immediately following the initial 2 months cleaning process, but this decreased to immeasurable values after a further 3 months of cleaning.

TI Purification of sodium borate by continuous solvent extraction with a
   Teflon phase separator
SO BUNSEKI KAGAKU
AB A continuous extraction method was investigated to remove Mn-II, Fe-III, Co-II and Cu-II from sodium borate as a pH buffer reagent. The removal of impurities in a reagent is very important to decrease the reagent blank value, which would determine mainly the limit of detection in analyses of metals. 5,7-Diiodooxine (HR) was used as an extraction reagent because it has a high distribution constant between the aqueous phase and chloroform. The extractabilities of metal ions by the proposed method {aqueous phase (100 cm) and chloroform (40 cm(3))} were estimated based on the metal concentration in a sodium borate solution determined by graphite-furnace AAS. In the present method, the HR concentration in chloroform was 1.0 x 10(-3) M and the pH of the borate solution as a sample was 9.2. The organic phase containing the reagent and its metal chelates was transferred to a distillation vessel at a rate of 2.0 cm(3) min(-1) after separation from the aqueous phase by a Teflon phase separator in an extraction vessel under highspeed stirring. The concentration of HR in the extraction vessel was then maintained constant by the addition of a fresh HR chloroform solution at a rate of 2.0 cm(3) min(-1). Above 99% of the metals as impurity could be removed after 40 min of extraction. The experimental behavior of the removal of the impurity by the present method agreed with theoretical curves calculated by using an equation derived in this study. The present method was applied to sodium borate to be reagent grade. The sodium borate obtained by the purification was used as a pH buffer reagent to determine zinc by a chemiluminescence method. Furthermore, the effect of purified sodium borate on the blank value was examined by a catalytic analysis. As a result, very low values of the reagent blank were observed by each method.

AB Purging and reduction of out-gassing are very important issues that need to be treated in order to realize F-2 laser lithography system. Several methods of purging are tried and out-gases from metals, O-rings, lubricants, and an adhesive are analyzed. Metal surfaces mainly release oxygen and water independent of surface roughness, Ni plating, or elements. Other substances are not detected by API-MS or GC-MS. Since O-rings are indispensable to make gas-tight structures, several kinds of O-rings made of fluoro-compounds are tested. Black fluoro-rubber o-ring, O-ring F, is recommended from the view of organic out-gassing but Teflon-based fluoro-elastomer, O-ring A, is a good candidate in terms of the water out-gassing. Greases emit a large amount of out-gases even when the samples are not irradiated by 157 nm laser. As an adhesive, Adhesive A is recommended because of the fact that it does not release as much organic and inorganic compounds which may absorb 157 run laser light. Finally preliminary demonstration using a model exposure system is performed to obtain purging time for several cases.

TI Flow injection analysis of cationic metal chelate ions by an on-line
   concentration method using a Teflon capillary tube
SO BUNSEKI KAGAKU
AB The spectrophotometric determination of trace amounts of iron and cobalt was investigated for flow injection analysis. Cationic or polarized metal chelates were concentrated on a Teflon surface, which was treated with a 2 M NaOH solution for 3 hours. Then, the metal chelates adsorbed in the Teflon capillary tube were eluted with a solvent mixture of ethanol and 0.1 M HNO3, and determined by on-line by spectrophotometry. Cobalt(III) reacted with tridentate ligands to form stable chelate complexes, which have cationic charge in the complexes. 2-(5-Bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-[N-n-propyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl) amino] aniline, sodium salt (5-Br-PSAA,) and 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphtol (PAN) were used to form cationic complexes as tridentate and mono valence ligands. The composition of the complexes obtained under the standard conditions was metal : ligand = 1:2. The metal complexes were concentrated for 10 min with 2.9 ml/min as the flow rate of the sample solution. As a result, the apparent molar absorption coefficients of the complexes were enhanced to 100 times as compared to each of there molar absorption coefficients. The optimum conditions were as follows: chelate complex preparation pH, 4.7; concentration pH, 8.9; eluent flow rate, 0.7 ml/min; measurement wavelength, 602 nm (Co-5-Br-PSAA), 554 nm (Fe-5-Br-PSAA), and 585 nm (Co-PAN), concentration tube length, 6 m. The cobalt was determined over the range 0.6 similar to 50 ppb with PAIN and 0.3 similar to 10 ppb with 5-Br-PSAA; iron (III) was 0.1 similar to 10 ppb with 5-Br-PSAA. The result of determination of iron (III) in tap water showed good agreement with the values obtained by ICP-AES.

AB Two transition metal salts (manganese and cobalt) of the nedocromil were prepared, and their crystal structures were elucidated in an attempt to study the influence of the nature of the bivalent cation on the structure, water interactions, and molecular packing. Crystal data: nedocromil manganese pentahydrate (NMn), triclinic, P (1) over bar, a = 7.5351(4) Angstrom, b = 10.3210(6) Angstrom, c = 13.9664(8) Angstrom, alpha = 86.640(1)degrees, beta = 80.880(1)degrees, gamma = 77.498(1)degrees, Z = 2; nedocromil cobalt heptahydrate (NCo), monoclinic. P2(1), a = 11.7847(2) Angstrom, b = 7.0177(2) Angstrom, c = 14.0700(1) Angstrom, beta = 105.343(1)degrees, Z = 2. Both Mn2+ and Co2+ have octahedral coordination, but the coordination environments of the cations and the bonding environments of the water molecules differ. In NMn, Mn2+ is octahedrally coordinated to two carboxylate oxygens, one in a syn orientation and the other in an anti orientation in a different asymmetric unit, and to four water molecules. In NCo, Co2+ is octahedrally coordinated to the carbonyl oxygen of the pyridone ring and to five water molecules. In NMn and NCo, the molecular conformations of the nedocromil anion are similar, with the carboxylate group on C2 almost in the same plane as the tricyclic ring, whereas the group on C8 is twisted out of the tricyclic plane. Thermal analytical data for NMn show that the water molecules in this hydrate are lost in two steps, of 4 mol and 1 mol of water, respectively. NCo also gave two dehydration steps but of about 6 mol of water and 1 mol of water, respectively.

TI Chemical composition of fugitive dust emitters in Mexico City
SO ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
AB The gravimetric and chemical composition of fugitive dust emitters of Mexico City were analyzed to determine the particulate matter source profiles. Samples of geological material, unpaved and paved roads, agricultural soil, dried lake, asphalt, cement plants, landfill, gravel, and tezontle soil, were collected directly from the ground using a broom and a dustpan. These were dried, sieved and taken through a laboratory resuspension chamber to emulate the natural wind-blown processes of bulk soils and also to provide a uniform deposit on Teflon membrane and quartz fiber filters for further gravimetric and chemical analyses Of PM2.5 and PM10 size fractions. Chemical analyses of the filters included X-ray fluorescence for elemental composition, ion chromatography for water soluble anions, atomic absorption for water soluble metals, automated colorimetric analysis for ammonium and thermal/optical reflectance analysis for carbon species. The data show that most fugitive emitters are composed of 20-30% PM2.5, which is relatively less than the reported contribution by fossil fuels and biomass (40-60%). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Design of ligands for the extraction of PtCl(6)(2-) in introduction to
   liquid CO(2)
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB The current solvent extraction method for refining platinum group metals (PGMs) creates contact between aqueous and organic phases and thus leads to cross-contamination. We have therefore endeavored to employ liquid carbon dioxide as the organic phase in such extractions to eliminate the waste stream deriving from organic contamination of the aqueous phase. Whereas traditional metal-binding ligands dissolve in CO(2) at moderate pressures, the resulting complexes [(LH(+))(2)MCl(x)(2-)] exhibit negligible solubility in CO(2) at pressures up to 400 atm. Consequently, we have designed and synthesized a series of highly CO(2)-soluble analogues to the metal-binding ligands currently used by the PGM-refining industry. We have measured equilibrium efficiency factors for various ligands and ligands bound to platinum. We have found that the structure of the CO(2)-philic component of the ligand affects the binding constant and hence that fluoroalkyls are better extractants of platinum than fluoroethers. Finally, we have noted that the phase behavior of the ligand-metal complex is a function of both the ligand structure and the identity of the metal, opening the possibility for separations based on both pressure and ligand selectivity.

AB Following the third servicing mission (SM3A in December '99) to the Hubble Space Telescope, analysis was performed on the two returned panels of multilayer insulation (MIDI) as well as two patches. The NEI panels had been in space since the telescope was launched in April '90 (9.7 years), while the patches were installed during the second servicing mission in February '97 (2.8 years).(1) This paper provides an overview of the tests performed on the returned metallized Teflon FEP along with a summary of results. Testing including determination of mechanical and optical properties, crystallinity and fractography. Because of the amount of material retrieved and the nominal environmental exposures of the retrieved materials, these analyses resulted in a fairly complete understanding of the degradation process affecting the materials on the telescope. Test results from SM3A materials showed significantly better mechanical strength than second servicing mission (SM2) samples.

In all cases, maximum specific growth rates corresponding to the same specific glucose uptake rates were calculated in addition to the fluxes of some 200 metabolic reactions. Use of nitrate resulted in lower specific growth rates compared to ammonia. Excretion of some organic metabolites was observed in both limitation cases.

TI Mechanistic diversity in a metalloenzyme superfamily
SO BIOCHEMISTRY
AB It is now appreciated that the relationships of proteins, particularly enzymes, within a protein superfamily can be understood not only in terms of their sequence similarities and three-dimensional structures but also by chemical threads that relate their functional attributes. The mechanistic ties among superfamily members can often be traced to a common transition state for the rate-limiting step of the reactions being catalyzed. This paper presents an analysis of a metalloenzyme superfamily, the members of which catalyze a very diverse set of reactions with unrelated transition states but a more general common mechanistic imperative. The vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily is composed of structurally related proteins with paired beta alpha beta beta beta motifs that provide a metal coordination environment with two or three open or readily accessible coordination sites to promote direct electrophilic participation of the metal ion in catalysis. The known types of reactions that are catalyzed include isomerizations (glyoxalase I), epimerizations (methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase), oxidative cleavage of C-C bonds (extradiol dioxygenase), and nucleophilic substitutions (fosfomycin resistance proteins). The remarkable access to mechanism space that is provided by the VOC superfamily appears to derive from a simple, pseudosymmetric structural fold that maximizes the catalytic versatility of the metal center.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
CT Workshop on Environmental Tobacco Smoke Risl Assessment
CY JUL 09-10, 1998
CL BALTMORE, MARYLAND
AB This article reviews the epidemiologic studies of the association of ischemic heart disease risk and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure from a spouse who smokes. Seventeen studies (nine cohort, eight case-control) comprising more than 485,000 lifelong nonsmokers and 7,345 coronary heart disease (CHD) events were included in a meta-analysis. Together, these studies include 36% more CHD events and 58% more study subjects than were available for review by the U.S. Occupationai Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 1994. The relative risk (RR) for fatal or nonfatal coronary events among never smokers married to smokers, compared to those whose spouses did nor smoke, was RR = 1.25 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.17-1.33) across the combined studies. This association was statistically similar in men (RR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.15-1.32) and women (RR = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.15-1.32); in studies of cohort (RR = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.15-1.31) and case-control (RR = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.19-1.81) design; in the United Stales (RR = 1.22, 95% CI, 1.13-1.30) and other countries (RR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.21-1.65); and in studies of fatal (RR = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.14-1.30) and nonfatal (RR = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.04-1.67) heart disease. in three studies that presented data separately for nonsmokers married to current or former smokers, the association was stronger when the spouses continued to smoke (RR = 1.16, 1.06-1.28) than With former smokers (RR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89-1.08). The aggregate data are unlikely to be attributable to chance, publication bias, confounding, or misclassification of exposure. The evidence linking heart disease and FTS exposure from a spouse has become substantially stronger-since OSHA first proposed including heart disease in its risk assessment of ETS in 1994.

   evidence from monitoring studies
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
CT Workshop on Fate of Pesticides in the Atmosphere Implications for Risk
   Assessment
CY APR 22-24, 1998
CL DRIEBERGEN, NETHERLANDS
AB Recently, evidence has accumulated that the extensive use of modern pesticides results in their presence in the atmosphere at many places throughout the world. In Europe over 80 current-use pesticides have been detected in rain and 30 in air. Similar observations have been made in North America. The compounds most often looked for and detected are the organochlorine insecticide lindane and triazine herbicides, especially atrazine. However, acetanilide and phenoxyacid herbicides, as well as organophosphorus insecticides have also frequently been found in rain and air. Concentrations in air normally range from a few pg/m(3) to many ng/m(3). Concentrations in rain generally range from a few ng/L to several mu g/L. In fog even higher concentrations are observed. Deposition varies between a few mg/ha/y and more than 1 g/ha/y per compound. However, these estimates are usually based on the collection and analysis of (bulk) precipitation and do not include dry particle deposition and gas exchange. Nevertheless, model calculations, analysis of plant tissue, and first attempts to measure dry deposition in a more representative way, all indicate that total atmospheric deposition probably does not normally exceed a few g/ha/y. So far, little attention has been paid to the presence of transformation products of modern pesticides in the atmosphere, with the exception of those of triazine herbicides, which have been looked for and found frequently.
   Generally, current-use pesticides are only detected at elevated concentrations in air and rain during the application season. The less volatile and more persistent ones, such as lindane, but to some extent also triazines, are present in the atmosphere in low concentrations throughout the year. In agricultural areas, the presence of modern pesticides in the atmosphere can be explained by the crops grown and pesticides used on them. They are also found in the air and rain in areas where they are not used, sometimes even in remote places, just like their organochlorine predecessors. Concentrations and levels are generally much lower there. These data suggest that current-use pesticides can be transported through the atmosphere over distances of tens to hundreds, and sometimes even more than a thousand kilometres. The relative importance of these atmospheric inputs varies greatly. For mountainous areas and remote lakes and seas, the atmosphere may constitute the sole route of contamination by pesticides. In coastal waters, on the other hand, riverine inputs may prevail. To date, little is known about the ecological significance of these aerial inputs.

AB A gradient eluent HPLC analysis in human plasma and urine was developed and validated for methylprednisolone (MP), its prodrug methylprednisolone-21-hemisuccinate (MPS) with the metabolites 6 beta-hydroxy-6 alpha-methylprednisolone (MPA), 20-hydroxymethylprednisolone (MPC), 6 beta-hydroxy-20 alpha-hydroxymethylprednisolone (MPB), 6 beta-hydroxy-20 beta-hydroxymethylprednisolone (MPE), 20-carboxymethylprednisolone (MPD), methylprednisolone-glucuronide (MPF) and 21-carboxymethylprednisolone (MPX). The column was Cp Spherisorb C8 5 mu m, 250 mm x 4.6 mm I.D. (Chrompack, Bergen op Zoom, The Netherlands) with a guard column 75 mm x 2.1 mm, packed with pellicular reversed-phase. The eluent was a mixture of acetonitrile and 0.067 M KH2PO4 buffer, pH 4.5. At t=0, the eluent consisted of 2% acetonitrile and 98% buffer (v/v). Over the following 35 min the eluent changed linearly until it attained a composition of 50% acetonitrile and 50% buffer (v/v). At 37 min (t=37) the eluent was changed over 5 min to the initial composition, followed by equilibration over 3 min. The flow-rate was 1.5 ml/min and UV detection was achieved at 248 nm. Preliminary pharmacokinetic data were obtained from one patient who showed illustrative plasma concentration-time curves and renal excretion-time profiles after a short-lasting infusion (0.5 h) of 1 g of methylprednisolone hemisuccinate. The half-life of prodrug methylprednisolone-21-hemisuccinate (MPS) was 0.3 h, that of metabolite MPX (21-carboxy MP) was 0.4 h and that of the parent drug methylprednisolone (MP) was 1.4 h. The half-lives of the metabolites are almost similar (4 h). The main compounds in the urine are methylprednisolone hemisuccinate (prodrug, 15.0%), methylprednisolone (parent drug, 14.6%), metabolite MPD (20-carboxy, 11.7%), and metabolite MPB (13.2%). The renal clearance values of metabolites MPB, MPC and MPD are approximately 500 ml/min, that of MP is 100 ml/min. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

SO BUNSEKI KAGAKU
AB The chemiluminescence (CL) reactions of luminol with complexes of bis(acetylacetonato)oxovanadium(IV) and tris(8-quinolinolato) iron(In) in a reversed micellar medium of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) have been investigated in order to develop a flow CL method for vanadium(IV) and iron(III) determinations based on the coupling of solvent extraction with reversed micellar-mediated CL detection. First, an enhancement of the CL emission was observed upon mixing the VO(acac)(2) complex in chloroform xith the CTAC reversed micellar solution of luminol, even when hydrogen peroxide was absent. The free VO(IV) ion produced transiently from decomposition of the complex at the reversed micellar interface is considered to catalyze the CL oxidation of luminol by dissolved oxygen. Secondly, the CL detection based on the luminol-hydrogen peroxide CL emission, enhanced by the Fe(oxine)(3) complex in reverse micelles, was combined with on-line extraction through the formation of the complex, followed by separation through a microporous Teflon membrane. In a sample solution containing Fe(II) and Fe(III), the addition of a reaction process using hydrogen peroxide to oxidize Fe(II) to Fe(III) prior to the extraction in this flow system provides for the determination of total iron, Fe(II) + Fe(III), while only Fe(III) can be determined by the absence of hydrogen peroxide.

TI Heavy metals in atmospheric surrogate dry deposition
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB This paper describes a methodological approach for the assessment of the amount of surrogate dry deposition of several toxic heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) associated with atmospheric particulate matter at ground level.
   The objectives of the study were twofold:
   i) the evaluation of several techniques for the digestion of dry deposition samples for trace metal analysis;
   ii) the comparison of the results from two samplers with different collecting surfaces.
   A dry solid surface sampler (DRY sampler, Andersen - USA) and a water layer surface sampler (DAS sampler- MTX Italy) were employed. The samples were collected over a one-year period in an urban site of Bologna (northern Italy).
   A description is given of the complete procedure, from sampling to data elaboration, including sample storage, digestion and analytical methods.
   According to the results obtained with three different digestion techniques (Teflon bomb, microwave digester and Teflon flask with vapour cooling system), the highest recovery rate was achieved by the Teflon bomb procedure employing an NBS 1638 Standard Reference Material; 90-95% of the elements considered were recovered by dissolution in a pressurized Teflon bomb with an HNO3-HF mixture. Given these results, the technique was adopted for dry deposition sample digestion.
   On the basis of the amount of heavy metals measured as monthly deposition fluxes (mu g/m(2)), the collecting efficiency of the DAS sampler for a number of elements was found to be as much as two to three times greater than that of the DRY sampler.

TI Kinetics and selectivity of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis: A literature
   review
SO CATALYSIS REVIEWS-SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB A critical review of the kinetics and selectivity of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is given. The focus is on reaction mechanisms and kinetics of the water-gas shift and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactions. New developments in the product selectivity as well as the overall kinetics are reviewed. It is concluded that the development of rate equations for the FTS should be based on realistic mechanistic schemes. Qualitatively, there is agreement that the product distribution is affected by the occurrence of secondary reactions (hydrogenation, isomerization, reinsertion, and hydrogenolysis). At high CO and H2O pressures, the most important secondary reaction is readsorption of olefins, resulting in initiation of chain growth processes. Secondary hydrogenation of a-olefins may occur and depends on the catalytic system and the process conditions. The rates of the secondary reactions increase exponentially with chain length. Much controversy exists about whether these chain-length dependencies stem from differences in physisorption, solubility, or diffusivity. Preferential physisorption of longer hydrocarbons and increase of the solubility with chain length influences the product distribution and results in a decreasing olefin-to-paraffin ratio with increasing chain length. Process development and reactor design should be based on reliable kinetic expressions and detailed selectivity models.

TI Investigation of porewater sampling methods for mercury and
   methylmercury
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The feasibility of various techniques for the separation and quantification of sediment and sediment porewaters for total Hg and methylmercury (MMHg)-centrifugation, sediment filtration, whole core squeezing, and dialysis membrane techniques (peepers)-were investigated in estuarine sediments. The concentration and distribution of iron, manganese, MMHg, and total Hg in porewaters were compared to ascertain which method provided the best technique for the collection of large volume porewater samples. Direct filtration techniques did not provide sufficient sample volume. Our studies confirmed the need to filter in an inert atmosphere. Processing in an inert atmosphere is also required for centrifugation. Centrifugation was the most difficult method, requiring extensive operator training and much attention to detail during sample processing. Core squeezing is a viable alternative but suffers from sample size problems and potential artifacts due to oxidation during processing. While peepers have advantages, the investigations here show that they need to be completely degassed before they provide reliable Hg speciation measurements, especially as they were constructed from Teflon, which can store significant amounts of oxygen. The need to deoxygenate the peepers compromises their use as a routine separation method for Hg. On the basis of the need for large volumes and the large number of samples to be collected, we concluded that centrifugation was the most reliable method for the determination of Hg and MMHg in estuarine porewaters.

TI Fatty acids stimulate cholecystokinin secretion via an acyl chain
   length-specific, Ca2+-dependent mechanism in the enteroendocrine cell
   line STC-1
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON
AB 1.The present study has investigated whether fatty acids directly influence peptide release from enteroendocrine cells using STC-1, a mouse intestinal endocrine tumour cell line, previously shown to release cholecystokinin (CCK) in response to other physiological stimuli.
   2. Fatty acids elicited a chain length- and dose-dependent stimulation of CCK secretion. Dodecanoic acid (C12) was most effective, producing up to a 5-fold increase in CCK secretion. Fatty acids with less than ten carbon atoms did not increase secretion. The chain length dependence of these effects mimics closely fatty acid-induced CCK secretion previously observed in humans in vivo.
   3. Esterification of C12 abolished CCK secretion, indicating a critical role for a free carboxyl group in eliciting secretion. In contrast, modification of the methyl terminus had no effect on GIB-induced secretion. The non-metabolizable C12 analogue 2-bromododecanoic acid was equally effective.
   4. C12 elicited a marked increase in intracellular calcium levels (200-300 nM) in STC-1 cells which was abolished by the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist nicardipine. In contrast, C8 produced a smaller and more transient Ca2+ response. C12-induced CCK secretion was also blocked by nicardipine.
   5. These data suggest that fatty acids can interact directly with enteroendocrine cells to stimulate CCK secretion via increases in intracellular calcium mediated primarily by L-type Ca2+ channels.

AB This study provides a quantitative review of the empirical literature on gender wage discrimination. Although there is considerable agreement that gender wage discrimination exists, estimates of its magnitude vary widely. Our meta-regression analysis (MRA) reveals that the estimated gender gap has been steadily declining and the wage rate calculation to be crucial. Large biases are likely,when researchers omit experience or fail to correct for selection bias. Finally, there appears to be significant gender bias in gender research. However, it is a virtuous variety where researchers tend to compensate for potential bias implicit in their gender membership. (JEL 57, C8)

AB Echocardiographic image interpretation is predominantly a subjective process, generally performed using the 'eyeball' technique and thus critically dependent on the reviewer's experience. In the past, software packages for digital image analysis have been limited. Recently, Advanced Technology Laboratories (ATL) has introduced HDI Lab for the analysis of digital images from the ATL HDI 5000 CV ultrasound machine. The purpose of this study was to apply HDI Lab to characterize the normal patterns of echocardiographic contrast uptake into the myocardium. Only by understanding the spatial variation in contrast uptake with normal perfusion can this technique be applied to patients with coronary artery disease.
   Digital images were obtained from 7 normal volunteers pre and post injection of Optison, microbubbles of albumin containing perfluorocarbon gas. Apical 4 and 2 chamber images were obtained in pulse-inversion harmonic mode, gated to end-diastole of every fourth beat, and stored to either a 3.5 " magneto-optical disk (MOD) on the echo machine or to a remote PC via a network connection. Images were stored in a polar format containing data fi om individual scan lines and echo density quantified from regions of interest in the basal, mid and apical regions of the inferior, septal, anterior and lateral walls. Multifactorial analysis of variance demonstrated highly significant (p<0.001) increase in echogenicity of all walls indicating definite contrast presence in the myocardium. However, there was considerable variability in contrast effect with a strong (p<0.004) gradient from the base (least intense) to-the apex (most intense), perhaps due to attenuation from overlying structures. Such heterogeneity of effect will have to be considered as contrast echocardiography is applied to patients with coronary artery disease.

AB In conjunction with capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry, membrane preconcentration can be used on line, prior to analysis, to provide concentration and cleanup of the sample. An impregnated membrane is inserted into a Teflon cartridge between two adjoining segments of uncoated silica tubing which is connected at the CE capillary inlet. This allows large sample injection volumes (1-100 mu L) to be concentrated prior to CE separation. An mPC-CE-MS method utilizing a new polystyrene divinylbenzene-reverse phase sulfonated membrane in conjunction with a polybrene coated capillary has allowed the identification of several hydrophilic and hydrophobic metabolites of 3-phenylamino-1,2-propanediol. This compound, along with a biotransformation product 3-(phenylamino)-alanine, has been implicated as possible etiological agents of two disease states, toxic oil syndrome and eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.

TI Use of a Nafion-modified electrode for the voltammetric determination
   and speciation of lead in human whole blood
SO QUIMICA ANALITICA
AB Anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) was used to determine lead in blood and blood fractions with the aid of separation techniques including ultrafiltration and gel permeation and affinity chromatographies, as well as to quantify the metal in whole blood and plasma. The ASV technique was employed in its differential pulse mode, using a mercury film electrode coated with the perfluorinated polymer Nafion in order to avoid adsorption of proteins and organic matter. In this way, limits of detections in the sub-nanogram-per-millilitre range were achieved. The acid pH provided by 0.5 M HCl causes the sample to hemolyse and release lead from its complexes, thus allowing the total lead content in blood to be measured.
   Three blood samples from individuals not exposed to the metal were analysed; they were found to contain less than 160 ng Pb mL(-1), most be bound to red blood cells. In fact, about 94% was located within erythrocytes ( 70% bound to hemoglobin and the rest to compounds of low molecular weight). The remaining 6% was present in plasma (49% bound to albumin and 51% to proteins, aminoacids and substances of low molecular weight). The information obtained allows one to readily establish clinical toxicity patterns for lead in blood.

TI Ellipsometric determination of the structure of surface-stabilized
   bilayer lipid membranes on silver metal
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB There has been substantial interest in the use of bilayer lipid membranes as the basis for development of biosensors, but limitations in thr physical stability of such membranes have prevented practical applications. The reliability and reproducibility of surface-stabilized bilayer lipid membranes (sBLMs), that have been reported to spontaneously form on metallic electrodes, may offer an attractive approach to development of a practical method of device fabrication. An important question which has been raised about sBLMs is whether the membranes are actually of a thickness of st bilayer lipid membrane. The physical structure of sBLMs have been studied indirectly by electrochemical methods, and the results show some differences from those obtained from freely suspended planar BLMs. Tn this present work, we report direct ellipsometric studies of the thickness of lipid films that spontaneously thin on silver metal. Silver metal was vacuum deposited on polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) polymer. Such surfaces are analogous to metal wire which is encapsulated by Teflon, as is typically used in experiments for sBLM formation. Ellipsometry of surfaces was done using a closed solution cell that allowed for hydration of lipid films. Silver surfaces that were coated with dry phospholipid, and with phospholipid in hexane : ethanol solvent, both showed that spontaneous thinning of Lipid films to monolayer, bilayer and trilayer thicknesses occurred in a few minutes. There was no dependence of membrane thickness or thinning rates on the diameter of the silver metal support over the range of 3.5 to 7.5 mm used in these studies. Immobilization of silver metal onto a chromium layer that was first applied to the PVDF was important in establishing increased speed of thinning and the physical stability of the system.

TI Effect of substitution site upon the oxidation potentials of
   alkylanilines, the mutagenicities of N-hydroxyalkylanilines, and the
   conformations of akylaniline-DNA adducts
SO CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN TOXICOLOGY
AB Carcinogenic arylamines typically undergo metabolic activation via N-hydroxylation followed in most instances by O-esterification. In this study, the ability of methyl-, dimethyl-, and ethylaniline constituents of tobacco smoke to undergo oxidation at the nitrogen atom was analyzed. In addition, the mutagenicity of the corresponding N-hydroxyalkylanilines and the conformational properties of the DNA adducts generated from their N-acyloxy derivatives were investigated. All the arylamines underwent irreversible electrochemical N-oxidation at potentials higher than those observed for the oxidation of carcinogenic polynuclear aromatic amines. There were minor differences in the oxidation potentials, which were consistent with the position and electron-donating abilities of the alkyl substituents; however, the differences appeared to be too small to account for the range of genotoxic effects among the alkylanilines. N-Hydroxyarylamines containing p-alkyl substituents had increased mutagenicities in Salmonella typhimurium TA100, which was attributed to their higher efficiencies of adduct formation. Increased mutagenicities were also observed upon o-alkyl substitution; however, this property was not related to a greater ability of the ortho-substituted species to form DNA adducts, which suggested that adducts from ortho-substituted alkylanilines may be intrinsically more mutagenic than their meta- and para-substituted analogues. In all instances, N-(acyloxy)arylamines generated from the N-hydroxyarylamines reacted with dG, dG nucleotides, and DNA to yield C8-substituted dG derivatives as the major adducts. The alkylaniline-dG adducts displayed distinct conformational trends that were determined by the location of the alkyl substituents. Spectroscopic data indicated higher percentages of low-energy syn conformers in the adducts that contained alkyl groups ortho to the arylamine nitrogen as opposed to adducts not bearing ortho substituents. The data strongly suggest that the conformational properties of the DNA adducts, in particular their ability to adopt syn conformations, may be determinant factors for the genotoxic responses elicited by certain alkylanilines (e.g., 2-methylaniline and 2,6-dimethylaniline).

TI Endoscopic treatment of reflux by subureteric collagen injection:
   Critical review of 5 years' experience
SO JOURNAL OF ENDOUROLOGY
AB In the past decade, subureteric endoscopic injection of Teflon or collagen has been propagated as a safe and successful treatment for vesicoureteral reflux, In our center, from 1990 through 1995, 118 children and 5 adults with reflux and recurrent urinary tract infections were injected with cross-linked bovine collagen in an open, prospective study, Efficacy and safety were assessed 6 and 12 months after injection, and long-term (greater than or equal to 3 years) results were available in 78 cases, The overall success rate was 58% (64% of ureteral units) free from reflux at 12 months and 54% (58%) after 3 years, Analysis of anatomic, urodynamic, and technical features showed the grade of reflux to be the best predictor of success or failure, When only primary low-and middle-grade reflux, without concomitant anatomic disorders, is considered, the long-term success rate rose to 69% (74% of ureteral units), In conclusion, subureteric collagen injection cannot ultimately replace the highly effective surgical reimplantation, However, the procedure offers a minimally invasive alternative in selected cases of mild reflux when conservative management is inadequate.

   heterobifunctional chelating agents: High efficiency nitrene insertion
   on model solvents and proteins
SO JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Synthesis and evaluation of a new class of photochemically activated heterobifunctional chelating agents for protein modification is described. Selective functionalization of perfluoroaryl azides by versatile phosphorus hydrazide ligating systems 2 and 3 for the complexation of transition metals and analogous radiometals form the basis for these new agents. The utility of the photogenerated precursors from these bifunctional agents to form covalent attachments is demonstrated through examination of C-H bond insertion on cyclohexane. Representative amide-coupled phosphorus hydrazides 5 and 6 provide > 78% insertion of the probe into unactivated C-H bonds of cyclohexane with short photolysis times. Photoconjugation of the photoactivable heterobifunctional chelating agent 6 and its Pd metalated analog 7 with HSA is also evaluated. The uncomplexed chelate appears to add to HSA with high efficiency, consistent with the observed 82% bond insertion into model solvents. Covalent attachment of 7, evaluated through the use of Pd-109, was estimated to be between 49% and 74% with the uncertainty arising because of prephotolysis association of the Pd-109 complex with HSA. The application of in situ F-19 NMR to distinguish between bond insertion and noninsertion processes is demonstrated. These results suggest that functionalized perfluoroaryl azido phosphorus hydrazides may find utility as heterobifunctional photolabeling agents for attaching radionuclides to proteins and antibodies.

AB Accurate mass analysis at high resolution can be used to determine elemental compositions and is often essential for conclusive metabolite identification, Reference standards can play an important role in the success of the analysis. We have discovered that perfluorinated acid anhydride/fluorinated alkylalcohol (PF-anh/F-alc) derivatives of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid are sensitively analysed by negative-ion electrospray ionization (ESI) and by positive-ion chemical ionization (CI), Based upon these results, PF-anh/F-alc derivatives of amino acids and PF-anh derivatives of primary amines were prepared, greatly expanding our collection of reference standards for accurate mass measurements, Sample ions are not suppressed since the reference standards can be selected based upon a narrow mass range of interest, They are volatile and, due to the degree of fluorination, have accurate masses favourably close to nominal mass, They are adequately soluble in reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography solvents, making them particularly useful for ESI, Several examples of positive-ion CI and negative-ion electrospray MS accurate mass analyses of metabolites, obtained using the PF-anh/F-alc derivatives, are described.

SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB The metabolism of polychlorinated biphenyls, dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs) can be studied well with a cytochrome P450 containing microsomal assay. In the present study, the residues of microsomal assays were extracted with organic solvents to determine the metabolites of the studied compounds with GC-ECD and GC-MS. Extracts of microsomal assays contained a matrix which interferes with these type of measurements. The matrix was hard to remove completely with solid phase adsorption chromatography. To overcome the problem of the interfering compounds, dean-up properties of a gel permeation chromatography system were studied for this specific matrix. The clean-up was firstly studied with model compounds and two different mobile phases. Thereupon the most appropriate mobile phase was applied to the extracts of a microsomal assay. Acetone and cyclohexane-dichloromethane (CH-DCM, 1:1, v/v) were compared as mobile phases. The elution profiles of several lipids and some organohalogen compounds (OHCs) were determined. The mixture CH-DCM yielded the best separation between lipids and the OHCs. The results were discussed with a theoretical evaluation on the basis of interactions between solute, solvent and stationary phase. Recoveries were assessed for the GPC procedure and appeared to be good (98-100% for the column itself and 80-100% for the sample transfer from vial to column). The GPC was integrated in the clean-up of the extract of a microsomal PCDF metabolism assay yielding satisfactory results.

TI Synthesis and use of deuterated fenamiphos and its metabolites as
   internal standards for mass spectrometric analysis in water
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB The applications of mass spectrometry (MS) are increasing in environmental analysis, pesticides measurement in particular. To take full advantage of the capabilities of MS it is important to have available labeled standards that enhance the performance of the quantitative analysis, increasing its accuracy and precision. We synthesized a series of deuterated internal standards corresponding to fenamiphos (Ia) and some of its metabolites, using rapid procedures and inexpensive materials. The use of 3-fluoro-3-(heptafluoropropyl)-2-(nonafluorobutyl)-cis-oxaziridine (IV) was particularly attractive for the preparation of oxidative metabolites of fenamiphos (Ia), analytical and deuterated standards. We used these compounds for the analysis of these pollutants in water. We used solid-phase extraction, testing several materials, and supercritical fluid extraction techniques. The analysis was done by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, with the selected ion monitoring (SIM) technique, obtaining good results with the oxidative metabolites of compound Ia (compounds IIa and IIIa). For the more polar metabolites Ib, IIb and IIIb, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis in the SIM mode gave the best result.

TI Application of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for total
   metal determination in silicon-containing solid samples using the
   microwave-assisted nitric acid hydrofluoric acid hydrogen peroxide boric
   acid digestion system
SO JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY
AB The microwave-assisted conventional HNO3-HF-H2O2H3BO3 digestion system has been explored for direct ICP-MS analysis of total metals in silicon-containing solid samples. In closed Teflon PFA vessels under microwave heating with temperature/pressure regulation, a 0.25 g portion of sample containing less than or equal to 33% silicon was digested in 1.5 ml of HF (48%), 5 ml of concentrated HNO3 and 2 ml of H2O2 (30%), followed by a second digestion stage with 12 ml of 5% m/v boric acid. The amount of HF used was approximately twice the stoichiometric requirement for 33% silicon contained in the samples, assuming all silicon exists as silica. The amount of boric acid used was the stoichiometric requirement for the HF added. With a sample dilution factor of 2000 (v/m), the end solution contained less than or equal to 0.17% total dissolved solids for ICP-MS analysis. The ICP-MS system was calibrated by the method of external standards prepared in reagent blank solutions with In as the internal standard. The sensitivity of the In signal in a 5-8 h operation was only decreased by 5-10%. Background interferences from the digestion reagents were studied and corrected. The method developed is simple and rugged and suitable for routine analysis of at least 25 elements: Al, Ag, As, Ba, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, Sr, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V and Zn. The recoveries for most of these elements in standard reference materials including coal fly ash, urban particulate matter, sediment and soil were within 90-110%, and the relative standard deviations were within 5%. The method cannot determine B and is not suitable for Hg determination. The detection limits for Be and Se determination are not adequate.

TI Measurement of inorganic contaminant extraction from fluid handling
   components by dynamic extraction
SO JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB This paper addresses extraction of inorganic contamination from fluid handling components into semiconductor process chemicals. It presents a method of dynamic extraction that measures the rate at which inorganic contaminants are extracted from components as a function of time. The method overcomes many of the shortcomings of conventional techniques. It allows prediction of the amount of contamination added to chemical in a process tool with time. Examples of its use to measure extraction from all-Teflon 0.05-mu m microporous membrane filters in 49 percent HF are included. Extraction from five different types of filters was measured Each filter was tested for 2 to 8 weeks with multiple samples taken during the course of the extraction for metal analysis. Filters of the same type had similar extraction rates and similar contaminant ''fingerprints.'' There were large differences between filter types. The use of an inappropriate O-ring on a filter cartridge was identified. The decrease in the rate of extraction from the filters was similar to theoretical predictions.

AB Polyurethane elastomers possess an outstanding balance of physical and mechanical properties and superior blood compatibility compared to other polymers such as silicone rubber, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and perfluorinated polymers. As a result, they are the preferred polymeric biomaterials for fabrication of various medical device components. Some important device applications for polyurethanes include peripheral and central venous catheters, pacemaker lead insulation, etc.
   Ether-based polyurethanes have been shown to be stable in vitro for many years, and yet when implanted undergo rapid microcracking. Microcracks not only weaken the polymer, but serve as nucleation sites for thrombus formation, and may eventually lead to catastrophic failure.
   In this communication we report on a new family of polycarbonate-based polyurethanes. Our data suggests that polycarbonate-based polyurethanes may have overcome the microcracking problems associated with the use of ether-based polyurethanes.

TI ION SELECTIVITY OF POLYMERIC MEMBRANE-BASED ELECTRODES - A
   PRELIMINARY-STUDY
SO BULLETIN OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB The potentiometric response of some polymeric membrane-based electrodes, namely, teflon film, silicon rubber film, teflon powder and polyvinyl fluoride powder electrodes and their ion selectivity towards hydrogen ion, alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, transition metal and group (III) metal ions are studied. The study reveals that with the exception of teflon film electrode, the remaining three electrodes possess better response characteristics. As the membrane electrodes do not make use of ally specific ion conducting species or carrier molecules, the potential development is due to the interaction of the ions of the analyte with the functional groups of the plasticizer used to prepare the membrane. Based on the sensitivities obtained it is evident that these polymeric membrane electrodes are good for the analysis of alkali or alkaline earth metal ions. However, as the interaction of the ions with the functional group of the plasticizer determines the potential development, the selectivity towards a particular ion is not found in these electrodes and because of that they are suitable only for the analysis of individual metal ions.

TI NOVEL REACTIONS OF PERFLUOROALKYLPHENYL SULFIDES WITH ORGANOLITHIUM
   REAGENTS
SO JOURNAL OF FLUORINE CHEMISTRY
AB The reaction of anisole with organolithium reagents, commonly known as ortho-directed metallation, is of considerable synthetic utility in organic chemistry and as such has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Over the past 50 years, several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the observed regioselective metallation. For the first time, the reaction of perfluoroalkylphenyl sulfides with organolithium reagents has been investigated and found to furnish products resulting from the replacement of the perfluoroalkyl moieties with alkyl groups derived from the metallating agents. Phenyltrifluoromethyl ether, the anisole analog, failed to undergo metallation. A rationalization for the formation of unusual products via mediation of a single-electron-transfer process is presented in this paper together with the spectral data of the products.

TI THE EFFECT OF VARYING HALOGEN SUBSTITUENT PATTERNS ON THE
   CYTOCHROME-P450 CATALYZED DEHALOGENATION OF 4-HALOGENATED ANILINES TO
   4-AMINOPHENOL METABOLITES
SO BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB The cytochrome P450 catalysed biotransformation of 4-halogenated anilines was studied in vitro with special emphasis on the dehalogenation to 4-aminophenol metabolites. The results demonstrated that a fluorine substituent at the C4 position was more easily eliminated from the aromatic ring than a chloro-, bromo- or iodo-substituent. HPLC analysis of in vitro biotransformation patterns revealed that the dehalogenation of the C4-position was accompanied by formation of non-halogenated 4-aminophenol, without formation of NIH-shifted metabolites. Changes in the apparent V-max for the microsomal oxidative dehalogenation appeared to correlate with the electronegativity of the halogen substituent at C4, the fluorine substituent being the one most easily eliminated. A similar decrease in the rate of dehalogenation from a fluoro- to a chloro- to a bromo- to an iodo-substituent was observed in a system with purified reconstituted cytochrome P450 IIB1, in a tertiair butyl hydroperoxide supported microsomal cytochrome P450 system as well as in a system with microperoxidase 8. This microperoxidase 8 is a haem-based mini-enzyme without a substrate binding site, capable of catalysing cytochrome P450-like reaction chemistry. Together, these results excluded the possibility that the difference in the rate of dehalogenation with a varying C4-halogen substituent arose from a change in the contribution of cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in oxidative dehalogenation with a change in the halogen substituent. Rather, they strongly suggested that the difference was indeed due to an intrinsic electronic parameter of the various C4 halogenated anilines dependent on the type of halogen substituent. Additional in vitro experiments with polyfluorinated anilines demonstrated that elimination of the C4-fluorine substituent became more difficult upon the introduction of additional electron withdrawing fluorine substituents in the aniline-ring. F-19-NMR analysis of the metabolite patterns showed that the observed decrease in 4-aminophenol formation was accompanied by a metabolic switch to 2-aminophenols and N-hydroxyanilines, while products resulting from NIH-type mechanisms were not observed. For a C4-chloro-, bromo-, or iodo-substituted 2-fluoroaniline the V-max for the oxidative dehalogenation was reduced by the additional electron withdrawing fluorine substituent at the C2 position in a similar way. In conclusion, the results of the present study strongly indicate that the possibilities for cytochrome P450 mediated dehalogenation of 4-halogenated anilines to 4-aminophenol metabolites are dependent on: (i) the characteristics of the halogen that has to be eliminated, the most electronegative and smallest halogen being the one most easily eliminated, and (ii) the electron-withdrawing capacities of other substituents in the aromatic ring, electron-withdrawing substituents decreasing the relative rate of the reaction. Together these data lead to the conclusion that the halogen is eliminated as a halogen anion.

AB Four N-omega-fluoroalkyl-2 beta-carboxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane esters [N-fluoroethyl, methyl ester (beta-CIT-FE), N-fluoropropyl, methyl ester (beta-CIT-FP), N-fluoroethyl, isopropyl ester (IP-beta-CIT-FE), and N-fluoropropyl, isopropyl ester (IP-beta-CIT-FP)] were labeled with I-123 and evaluated in baboons by dynamic SPECT regional brain imaging, measurement of pharmacokinetics in arterial plasma, and whole body imaging. The labeled tracers were prepared by iododestannylation of the corresponding 4-(trimethylstannyl)phenyl compounds in radiochemical yield 63-96% and radiochemical purity >96%. Regional SPECT brain imaging was carried out over a period of 5 h with a Strichman 810X Brain Imager to assess regional uptake in the striatum and midbrain compared to reference regions in the occipital cortex and cerebellum; arterial blood samples were taken for analysis of metabolites by solvent extraction and HPLC. The methyl esters showed higher total and specific peak uptake in the striatum than the isopropyl esters. Midbrain uptake was uniformly lower than striatal uptake and washed out more rapidly. beta-CIT-FE had more rapid striatal kinetics than beta-CIT-FP, with specific striatal washout rates of 10-14 vs 4-6% peak/h. Biodistribution of [I-123]beta-CIT-FE and [I-123]beta-CIT-FP measured by whole body conjugate imaging demonstrated major uptake in the brain, liver, and GI tract, with excretion occurring through both the renal and hepatobiliary routes. Absorbed radiation dose estimates based on the MIRD schema indicated highest dose rates to the urinary bladder wall and lower large intestine wall (0.7 and 0.6 rad/mCi for [I-123]beta-CIT-FE and 0.7 and 0.9 rad/mCi for [I-123]beta-CIT-FP, respectively). The high uptake in the striatum and the relative specificity with respect to cortical, midbrain, and cerebellar areas, suggest that [I-123]beta-CIT-FE and [I-123]beta-CIT-FP may be valuable tracers for studying the dopamine system in vivo by tomographic imaging.

The polymer was prepared from radical copolymerization of 2-(perfluorooctyl)ethyl monomaleate with triethyleneglycol methyl vinyl ether. The metal ions examined were Na+, Cs+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, and Fe3+. The surface pressure-area isotherms show that all the monolayers on aqueous metal ions reveal more expanded phases than that on pure water. From the FT-IR (reflection and transmission) spectra, the formation of carboxylate salts and the relative pendent orientation of the polymer in LB film could be estimated. Quantitative analysis of metal ion concentration incorporated into the LB film was carried out by XPS measurement.

SO INVESTIGATIVE RADIOLOGY
AB RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES. A hepatocyte-specific iodinated lipid emulsion, NRI 757, was used for detection of experimental hepatic metastases.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. The study was performed in a correlative model of multiple hepatic metastases from a human colonic cancer implanted in the nude rat.
   RESULTS. After intravenous injection, normal liver parenchyma remained enhanced for several hours, whereas the uptake in hepatic metastases was negligible, A liver-to-lesion contrast of 45 Hounsfield units (HU) was obtained at a dose of 1 mt NRI 757/kg body weight (BW). In a lesion-by-lesion analysis of 177 metastases ranging in size from 1 to 32 mm, the mean +/- standard deviation overall detection rate for native scanning and contrast-enhanced scanning in vivo and post mortem, 20 +/- 0.4%, 53 +/- 5.2%, and 55 +/- 4.0%, respectively and 28%, 84%, and 82%, retrospectively. When metastatic size also was considered, for native scanning the maximum detection rate of 61% was reached for 8- to 10-mm lesions, whereas for contrast-enhanced computed tomography scanning, 100% of the 5- to 7-mm lesions and 42% of the 1- to 2-mm nodules were detected.
   CONCLUSION. The use of NRI 757 improved the diagnostic yield considerably.

AB F-Vinyl iodides and bromides react directly with cadmium or zinc metal to stereospecifically produce the corresponding F-vinyl cadmium and zinc reagents. These vinyl cadmium and zinc reagents exhibit excellent thermal stability (> 100 degrees C) and do not couple with F-vinyl halides. Metathesis with Cu(I) salts gives the analogous F-vinyl copper reagents. The F-vinyl copper reagents readily undergo stereospecific alkylation, coupling and acylation reactions. They also add stereospecifically syn to F-2-butyne to produce F-dienyl copper reagents. Acylation of the dienyl copper reagent gives a dienyl ketone which spontaneously undergoes electrocyclization to a pyran derivative. The F-vinyl zinc reagents couple to aryl iodides in the presence of Pd degrees and provide useful stereoselective routes to alpha,beta,beta-trifluorostyrenes and 1-arylperfluoropropenes. Similar Pd degrees catalyzed coupling of the E-vinyl zinc reagent with 1-iodoperfluoroolefins provides a stereospecific route to F-dienes. Reaction of bromopentafluorobenzene with cadmium metal gives the analogous F-aryl cadmium reagent, which readily undergoes metathesis with Cu(I) salts to give the F-aryl copper reagent essentially quantitatively. The F-aryl copper reagent also adds stereospecifically syn to F-2-butyne to give a vinyl copper reagent which is easily alkylated, arylated or acylated,

AB New recently implemented techniques and sample strategies for the determination of trace metals in seawater are discussed.  It is shown that only with the highest precautions to prevent contamination, reliable results can be obtained.  These precautions start already with the preparation of the sample bottles and sampling equipment in the laboratory.  A rubber boat, Go-Flo samplers and a specially designed teflon-coated winch with Kevlar rope is used to collect the samples.  At sea, the prevention of contamination of the samples is the highest priority.  This implicates the use of a clean air van or at least a laminary flow bench.  Acids have to be subboiling distilled in a quartz still and stored in teflon bottles.  Preconcentration of the samples on board or in the home laboratory has to be done in clean rooms.  This paper gives an account of current procedures used for sampling and analysing seawater for trace metal determinations.

Metals such as Fe and Cu are strongly adhered, and they can be removed to some extent by SPM or FPM cleaning. The surface metallic concentration of PFA sheets did not increase when they were dipped into UPW or chemicals contaminated with metals, therefore it is assumed that metallic impurities do not adhere to the PFA surface from liquids. Moreover the metallic transfer tests showed that a cleaned PFA sheet did not contaminate Si wafers but an uncleaned sheet polluted the wafer strongly with metallic impurities. Therefore, when PFA molded parts such as wafer carriers and tubes are used in wet processing in semiconductor manufacturing, they must be cleaned by SPM or FPM cleaning,

TI ANALYTICAL RELATED PROBLEMS IN METAL AND TRACE-ELEMENTS DETERMINATION IN
   INDUSTRIAL-WASTE LANDFILL LEACHATES
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The periodic analytical control of waste landfill leachate is of fundamental importance not only to check the presence of possible toxic substances, but also to assess changes in concentration levels and behaviour with time. This work identifies some of the difficulties which arise during the analysis of some heavy metals and trace elements in leachate samples from a controlled industrial wastes landfill located in north Italy. The analytical problems encountered using both electro-thermal atomic absorption spectroscopy (ETAAS) and neutron activation analysis (NAA) for the determination of a series of elements, Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni, Mn, V, As, Se, Sb, Th, Sn, Cs, W, Cr, with concentration often at nanogram levels, are presented and evaluated. To solve these problems two selective chemical procedures have been developed to separate and to eliminate the matrix interfering compounds or elements (i.e., organic matter, complexing agents, Cl-, Br-, S2- , Na+) which reduce and in some cases impair the sensitivity of the technique. For the analyses by ETAAS a preliminary preconcentration and separation procedure, based on the ion exchange resin Chelex-100 has been developed to determine Pb, Cd, Co, Cu, Ni and Sn. In the case of NAA a specific radiochemical separation had to be studied for the analysis of Sn, V, W, Mn, Cr, As, Sb, Se, Th in presence of high bromine and sodium concentrations. Procedures blanks and yields have been controlled and evaluated and quality assurance measurements have been carried out analyzing, with the proposed methods, standard reference materials from BCR and NIST. Furthermore, different mineralization procedures using both microwave and Teflon bomb have been compared and evaluated.

TI REGIOSELECTIVE HYDROXYLATION AND EPOXIDATION OF LAURIC ACID AND
   UNSATURATED ANALOGS BY CYTOCHROME-P450 IN JERUSALEM-ARTICHOKE MICROSOMES
SO PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Microsomes from aminopyrine induced Jerusalem artichoke tubers catalyze hydroxylations of lauric acid at C8, C9 and C10 carbon position with a molar metabolite ratio of 1/5.6/2 respectively. We had previously shown that cytochrome P450 was responsible for the hydroxylation of lauric (dodecanoic) acid and die epoxidation and allylic hydroxylation of Z and E 9-dodecenoic acids. The incubation of microsomes from aminopyrine induced Jerusalem artichoke tubers with a series of {1-C-14]radiolabelled 7-, 8-, 9-, and 10-dodecenoic acids (n-DDNA) produced oxygenated compounds which have been characterized as epoxy and hydroxy derivatives by reverse phase-high pressure chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. The epoxidation/hydroxylation ratio was directly related to the position, but not to the geometry, of the double bond in the aliphatic chain. Z and E isomers of substrates were oxidized with similar efficiencies. Analysis of metabolites demonstrates that oxidative attack of this series of unsaturated analogues occurs with a regioselectivity similar to that of laurate hydroxylation. Based on specific inhibition of enzyme activities, it was demonstrated that cytochrome P450 monooxygenases carry out hydroxylation at saturated carbon positions as well as epoxidation of double bonds.

TI MEMBRANE DEFENSE AGAINST COMPLEMENT LYSIS - THE STRUCTURE AND BIOLOGICAL
   PROPERTIES OF CD59
SO IMMUNOLOGIC RESEARCH
AB The complement system is an important branch of the innate immune response, constituting a first line of defence against invading microorganisms which activate complement via both antibody-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Activation of complement leads to (a) a direct attack upon the activating cell surface by assembly of the pore-forming membrane attack complex (MAC), and (b) the generation of inflammatory mediators which target and recruit other branches of the immune system. However, uncontrolled complement activation can lead to widespread tissue damage in the host, since certain of the activation products, notably the fragment C3b and the C5b-7 complex, can bind nonspecifically to any nearby cell membranes. Therefore it is important that complement activation is tightly regulated. Our own cells express a number of membrane-bound control proteins which limit complement activation at the cell surface and prevent accidental complement-mediated damage. These include decay-accelerating factor, complement receptor 1 and membrane cofactor protein, all of which are active at the level of C3/C5 convertase formation. Until recently, cell surface control of MAC assembly had been attributed to a single 65-kD membrane protein called homologous restriction factor (alternatively named C8-binding protein and MAC-inhibiting protein). However a second MAC-inhibiting protein has since been discovered and it is now clear that this protein plays a major role in the control of membrane attack. This review charts the rapid progress made in elucidating the protein and gene structure, and the mechanism of action of this most recently discovered complement inhibitor, CD59.

AB A new sample pretreatment procedure for water and waste water samples is presented. Complexing agents inhibit the determination of metals in instrumental analysis. These reagents often contain nitrogen or organic phosphate. During digestion with peroxodisulphate/alkali = Oxisolv(R) in combination with microwave heating in a closed Teflon-vessel, all N and P react to nitrate and phosphate. The resulting ions can be determined with photometric, AAS, voltammetric or other methods. NTA, EDTA, DTPA, TMT, TEA, CN- and TetraToruMin as complexing agents were tested. In the case of Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni and Zn higher recoveries were obtained in comparison with the DIN-method (NTA as complexing agent). Due to MnO2 precipitation for Mn no values could be found.

TI A COMPARISON OF METHODS FOR COLLECTING INTERSTITIAL WATER FOR TRACE
   ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS AND METALS ANALYSES
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Several common materials and methods used to collect interstitial water (IW) were evaluated to determine their effect on the accuracy and precision of measured concentrations of selected organic compounds and metals. We compared the concentration of pollutants in dosed seawater before and after exposure to stainless steel and Teflon centrifuge tubes, glass fiber and Nuclepore filters, cellulose dialysis membranes and fritted glass tubes. Exposure to most hardware materials did not significantly affect the concentration of four metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb) but there was significant loss (up to 79%) of two organic compounds (fluoranthene, p,p'-DDE) to almost all the hardware materials tested. Of five commonly used IW collection methods (centrifuging, centrifugal drainage or basal cup, squeezing, vacuum filtration and dialysis) investigated, the centrifuge method was judged the most accurate and precise for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and PCBs. All IW collection methods tested showed high variability for the metals. As a result, with one exception (Cu), there was no significant difference detected in the accuracy of the methods for metals.

TI POTENTIAL SAMPLING ERROR - TRACE-METAL ADSORPTION ON VACUUM POROUS CUP
   SAMPLERS
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
AB The adsorption of trace metals on ceramic, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE or Teflon), fritted glass, and stainless steel vacuum pore-water samplers and silica packing material used to seat samplers was evaluated with respect to potential sampling errors.  A solution containing radio-labeled Cd+2, Co+2, Cr+3, and Zn+2 and a mix of ions typically found in soil solutions was used to assess specific absorption of inorganics to porous cups of samplers and to silica.  Four sets of samplers were cleaned with acid or water and then treated with a solution containing trace metals at concentrations near primary or secondary drinking-water standards or one order of magnitude lower for 2 or 7 d.  After treatment, the samplers were rinsed with 10 or 30 pore volumes (PV) of simulated soil solution and radioassayed.  Duplicate silica samples were treated with the high-trace-metal solution adjusted to a pH of 4, 6, or 8 for a 5-d period, rinsed with simulated soil solution, and radioassayed.  Adsorption was greatest on samplers treated with high trace-meal concentrations and samplers cleaned with water.  Desorption of both Co and Zn occurred with the 30-PV soil solution rinse for all sampler types except stainless steel.  The general pattern of metal adsorption on samplers was ceramic > stainless steel >> fritted glass = PTFE.  The general order that trace metal adsorbed to samplers and silica was Zn >> Co > Cr > Cd.  At pH values of 6 to 8, trace-metal adsorption on silica (mass of adsorbent/mass of adsorbate) was similar to or greater than that observed for ceramic samplers.  This study shows that adsorption-desorption processes can cause sampling error when analysis of trace metals at microgram-per-liter concentration levels is necessary.

TI ANODIC-STRIPPING VOLTAMMETRY IN HIGHLY-RESISTIVE MEDIA BY ELECTRODES
   SUPPORTED ON ION-EXCHANGE MEMBRANES
SO ELECTROANALYSIS
AB An electroanalytical device is described that is suitable for trace metal analyses by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) in highly-resistive media in the absence of supporting electrolytes. It consists of a thin mercury film electrodeposited at the glassy carbon-ion-exchange membrane interface obtained by clamping a glassy carbon ring to one surface of a perfluorinated ion-exchange membrane (cationic, Nafion 117, or anionic, Tosflex IE SA48). The inner surface of the membrane is in contact with an electrolyte solution (0.01 M HClO4), containing the counter and reference electrodes. The ion-exchange membrane replaces a conventional supporting electrolyte dissolved in the analyte sample and can be regarded as a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) confined to the near neighborhood of the working electrode.
   This device has been used to perform differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetric (DPASV) analyses of electrolyte-free aqueous synthetic samples containing copper and lead ions. Better results are found at glassy carbon-supported mercury electrodes facing anionic Tosflex membranes, since similar devices assembled with cationic Nafion membranes experience a memory effect associated with blockage of metal ions, due to cation-exchange processes that occur during the stripping redissolution step, even though these processes are able, at the same time, to lead to an increase of DPASV peaks due to metal ion accumulation near the electrode surface. Approximate detection limits of 3.5 x 10(-10) M (0.02 ppb) for Cu2+ and 3 x 10(-10) M (0.05 ppb) for Pb2+ are estimated at Tosflex-equipped devices for a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. Possible modifications aimed at improving the performance of such a device are discussed.

TI DIFFERENTIAL PULSE VOLTAMMETRIC DETERMINATION OF COBALT WITH A
   PERFLUORINATED SULFONATED POLYMER-2,2-BIPYRIDYL MODIFIED CARBON PASTE
   ELECTRODE
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB A highly selective method for the determination of cobalt with a chemically modified carbon paste electrode is proposed.  It is based on the chemical reactivity of an immobilized modifier, 2,2-bipyridyl, toward cobalt(II) ion to yield the corresponding cation complex ((Bpy)3Co)2+, which is taken up by another modifier, perfluorinated sulfonated polymer (Nafion).  Differential pulse voltammetry is employed, and the oxidation of the complex, at +0.1 V vs SCE, is observed.  For a 5-min preconcentration period, a linear calibration curve is obtained for cobalt concentrations ranging from 7 X 10(-7) to 1 X 10(-5) mol/L, and the detection limit is 3 X 10(-7) mol/L.  A lower detection limit can be obtained for longer preconcentration times.  For eight preconcentration/determination/renewal cycles, the differential pulse voltammetric response could be reproduced with 4.3% relative standard deviation.  Rapid and convenlent acid renewal allows the use of an individual modified electrode surface in multiple analytical quantitations.  Many coexisting metal ions have little or no effect on the determination of cobalt.  The procedure was applied to the determination of cobalt for four standard reference materials with relative standard deviation of 4.0-5.2%.

TI IS HEPARIN REALLY NECESSARY IN THE LOCK AND, IF SO, HOW MUCH
SO DICP-THE ANNALS OF PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB The literature on the issue of whether heparin is necessary in an intermittent peripheral venous access device (lock) is critically reviewed.  Issues explored include loss of patency, development of phlebitis, duration of lock placement, type of cannula material, sample size, risk of toxicity with heparin flush solutions, risk of clot embolism, and physical or chemical incompatibilities.  Available studies indicate that heparin is not necessary to maintain fluoroethylenepropylene (FEP-Teflon) peripheral venous access devices unless the lock is used to obtain blood specimens.  Considering the benefit-to-risk ratio for the use of heparin, it is advisable to maintain FEP-Teflon locks with normal saline alone.  When locks are used to obtain blood specimens, as in a pharmacokinetic study, then a dilute heparin flush solution should be used.  Whether heparin is necessary for the maintenance of locks composed of other materials is uncertain.  Newer, less thrombogenic materials such as ethylene tetrafluoroethylene may also obviate the need for heparin, but comparative trials in a larger number of patients are needed for confirmation.  When heparin is used, an effort should be made to avoid systemic toxicities by using the lowest known effective concentration (10 units/mL) pending further studies.

TI MONOTERPENES AND MICROBIAL METABOLITES IN THE SOIL
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Volatile microbial metabolites were analysed in the soil beneath 15 H year-old Picea abies which had been fumigated for 5 consecutive years with charcoal-filtered air enriched with ozone and sulphur dioxide. Major compounds which could be attributed to the metabolism of basidiomycete fungi were oct-1-en-3-ol, oct-1-en-3-one and 1,3-octadiene. They were accompanied by other C8-compounds. The lower amounts of C8-compounds observed in the soil of the sulphur dioxide and ozone treatment chambers indicate a reduced development of basidiomycetes. The higher amounts of geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol found in the soil of the ozone treatment chamber indicate an increase in actinomycete populations. The differences of the monoterpene patterns in the particular soils were not large enough to recognize trends unequivocally.
