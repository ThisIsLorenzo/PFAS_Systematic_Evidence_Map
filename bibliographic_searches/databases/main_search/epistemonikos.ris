AB  - Per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS), ubiquitously present in the environment and biota, are transferred to the fetus via the placenta. PFAS can be distinguished, among other things, by their different carbon chain lengths and functional groups. The aim of this study was to provide comprehensive evidence on PFAS transfer rates across the human placental barrier by means of a meta-analysis based upon a systematic review. The available literature up to April 2021 was reviewed and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) of PFAS assessed. A total of 39 studies reporting data on 20 PFAS were included in the systematic review. Of these, 20 studies with data on 19 compounds were included in the meta-analysis. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA v3.0) was used for quantitative, statistical analyses with random effects models. A curvilinear relationship was found with short and long chains of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) exhibiting higher TTE than compounds with intermediate chain length. Among the less well studied PFAS, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), 6:2 fluorotelomersulfonic acid (6:2 FTS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) stood out the most with a high TEEs. The dependence of TTEs on chain length and functional group is clearly shown in this first meta-analysis on PFAS transfer across the human placenta. More data on effects of less well studied PFAS in pregnant women and neonates are needed to assess the potential risk for fetal exposure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize the application of non-targeted metabolomics in epidemiological studies that assessed metabolite and metabolic pathway alterations associated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure. RECENT FINDINGS: Eleven human studies published before April 1st, 2021 were identified through database searches (PubMed, Dimensions, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus), and citation chaining (Citationchaser). The sample sizes of these studies ranged from 40 to 965, involving children and adolescents (n = 3), non-pregnant adults (n = 5), or pregnant women (n = 3). High-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was the primary analytical platform to measure both PFAS and metabolome. PFAS were measured in either plasma (n = 6) or serum (n = 5), while metabolomic profiles were assessed using plasma (n = 6), serum (n = 4), or urine (n = 1). Four types of PFAS (perfluorooctane sulfonate(n = 11), perfluorooctanoic acid (n = 10), perfluorohexane sulfonate (n = 9), perfluorononanoic acid (n = 5)) and PFAS mixtures (n = 7) were the most studied. We found that alterations to tryptophan metabolism and the urea cycle were most reported PFAS-associated metabolomic signatures. Numerous lipid metabolites were also suggested to be associated with PFAS exposure, especially key metabolites in glycerophospholipid metabolism which is critical for biological membrane functions, and fatty acids and carnitines which are relevant to the energy supply pathway of fatty acid oxidation. Other important metabolome changes reported included the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle regarding energy generation, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism in cellular energy systems. CONCLUSIONS: There is growing interest in using non-targeted metabolomics to study the human physiological changes associated with PFAS exposure. Multiple PFAS were reported to be associated with alterations in amino acid and lipid metabolism, but these results are driven by one predominant type of pathway analysis thus require further confirmation. Standardizing research methods and reporting are recommended to facilitate result comparison. Future studies should consider potential differences in study methodology, use of prospective design, and influence from confounding bias and measurement errors.

AU  - Zhang Jackie X
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have recently drawn great attention due to their ubiquitous presence in aquatic environments and potential toxicity to human health and the environment. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that "passive" removal approaches, such as adsorption, filtration, and reverse osmosis or "active" degradation technologies, such as enhanced photolysis, electrochemical oxidation, and sonochemical destruction, are all able to individually conduct remedial measures for PFAS contamination at some level. However, drawbacks, specifically high energy consumption, low cost-efficiency, and extreme operating conditions, are commonly observed from these studies which significantly suppress the future for commercialization of these innovative technologies. Since 2015, a new trend of PFAS remediation has emerged that uses multiple synergetic technologies simultaneously (known as treatment train processes) to effectively achieve in-situ remediation of PFAS. This paper provides new insight of the recently reported treatment train studies selected from approximately 150 different publications with regards to the remediation of PFAS and discusses their innovative designs, remediation performances, present limits, and possible improvements. Based on a comprehensive review of the current treatment train studies, this review work proposes a new design that consists of three individual technologies, namely, nanofiltration, electrochemical anodic oxidation, and electro-Fenton degradation, to maximize economic and environmental benefits of PFAS remedial measures.

AU  - DeLuca NM
AU  - Minucci JM
AU  - Mullikin A
AU  - Slover R
AU  - Cohen Hubal EA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been primarily attributed to contaminated food and drinking water. There is information indicating other sources and pathways of exposure in residential environments, but few studies report relationships between these indoor media and human biomonitoring measurements. METHODS: This study adapts existing systematic review tools and methodologies to synthesize evidence for PFAS exposure pathways from indoor environment media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust. Studies were identified using innovative machine learning approaches and pathway-specific search strings to reduce time needed for literature search and screening. The included studies and systematic review were evaluated using tools modified specifically for exposure studies. The systematic review was conducted following a previously published protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) that describes the systematic review methodology used in detail. RESULTS: Only 7 studies were identified that measured the targeted subset of 8 PFAS chemicals in concordant household media (primarily house dust) and participant serum. Data extracted from the included studies were used to calculate exposure intake rates and estimate a percentage of occupant serum concentrations that could be attributed to the indoor exposure pathways. These calculations showed that exposure to PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS from contaminated house dust could account for 13%, 3%, 7%, and 25% of serum concentrations, respectively. Inhalation of PFAS in indoor air could account for less than 4% of serum PFOA concentrations and less than 2% of serum PFOS and PFNA concentrations. A risk of bias was identified due to participant profiles in most of the studies being skewed towards white, female, and higher socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: Along with synthesizing evidence for estimated contributions to serum PFAS levels from indoor exposure media, this systematic review also identifies a consistent risk of bias across exposure study populations that should be considered in future studies. It highlights a major research gap and need for studies that measure concordant data from both indoor exposure media and participant serum and the need for continued research on exposure modeling parameters for many PFAS chemicals.

TI  - Human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) through drinking water: A review of the recent scientific literature.
AU  - Domingo JL
AU  - Nadal M
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of water-soluble chemical compounds with an important number of applications, which have been widely used during the last 60 years. Two of them, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are the most known and well investigated. As for many other organic substances that are of environmental concern, the diet is the main route of human exposure to PFAS. However, in certain cases drinking water may also mean a significant contribution to human exposure, and to a lesser extent, dust and air (indoor exposure). In recent years, the environmental persistence of PFAS, their biomagnification in food webs, as well as their potential accumulation and toxicity, have generated a notable interest, which has been evidenced by the considerable number of publications in this regard. Recently, we carried out a wide revision on the levels of PFAS in food and human dietary intake. In the current review, we have summarized the recent information (last 10 years) published in the scientific literature (Scopus and PubMed) on the concentrations of PFAS in drinking water and the human health risks derived from the regular water consumption, when available. A large amount of data belongs to PFOS and PFOA and corresponds to studies mainly conducted in countries of the European Union, USA and China, although no information is available for most countries over the world. According to the toxicological information about PFAS that is so far available, the current health risks for the regular consumers of municipal/tap water do not seem to be of concern according to the levels considered as acceptable for various regulatory institutions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To date, the evidence for an association between perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between early life exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and ADHD in a collaborative study including nine European population-based studies, encompassing 4,826 mother-child pairs. METHODS: Concentrations of PFOS and PFOA were measured in maternal serum/plasma during pregnancy, or in breast milk, with different timing of sample collection in each cohort. We used a validated pharmacokinetic model of pregnancy and lactation to estimate concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in children at birth and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of age. We classified ADHD using recommended cutoff points for each instrument used to derive symptoms scores. We used multiple imputation for missing covariates, logistic regression to model the association between PFAS exposure and ADHD in each study, and combined all adjusted study-specific effect estimates using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 399 children were classified as having ADHD, with a prevalence ranging from 2.3% to 7.3% in the studies. Early life exposure to PFOS or PFOA was not associated with ADHD during childhood [odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 0.96 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.06) to 1.02 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.11)]. Results from stratified models suggest potential differential effects of PFAS related to child sex and maternal education. CONCLUSION: We did not identify an increased prevalence of ADHD in association with early life exposure to PFOS and PFOA. However, stratified analyses suggest that there may be an increased prevalence of ADHD in association with PFAS exposure in girls, in children from nulliparous women, and in children from low-educated mothers, all of which warrant further exploration. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5444.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been associated with lower birth weight in epidemiologic studies. This association could be attributable to glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is related to PFAS concentration and birth weight. OBJECTIVES: We used a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of pregnancy to assess how much of the PFAS-birth weight association observed in epidemiologic studies might be attributable to GFR. METHODS: We modified a PBPK model to reflect the association of GFR with birth weight (estimated from three studies of GFR and birth weight) and used it to simulate PFAS concentrations in maternal and cord plasma. The model was run 250,000 times, with variation in parameters, to simulate a population. Simulated data were analyzed to evaluate the association between PFAS levels and birth weight due to GFR. We compared simulated estimates with those from a meta-analysis of epidemiologic data. RESULTS: The reduction in birth weight for each 1-ng/mL increase in simulated cord plasma for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was 2.72 g (95% CI: -3.40, -2.04), and for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was 7.13 g (95% CI: -8.46, -5.80); results based on maternal plasma at term were similar. Results were sensitive to variations in PFAS level distributions and the strength of the GFR-birth weight association. In comparison, our meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies suggested that each 1-ng/mL increase in prenatal PFOS and PFOA levels was associated with 5.00 g (95% CI: -21.66, -7.78) and 14.72 g (95% CI: -8.92, -1.09) reductions in birth weight, respectively. CONCLUSION: Results of our simulations suggest that a substantial proportion of the association between prenatal PFAS and birth weight may be attributable to confounding by GFR and that confounding by GFR may be more important in studies with sample collection later in pregnancy.

TI  - Exposure to Perfluorinated Alkyl Substances and Health Outcomes in Children: A Systematic Review of the Epidemiologic Literature.
AU  - Rappazzo KM

AU  - Hines EP
AB  - Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals used to make products stain and stick resistant, have been linked to health effects in adults and adverse birth outcomes. A growing body of literature also addresses health effects in children exposed to PFAS. This review summarizes the epidemiologic evidence for relationships between prenatal and/or childhood exposure to PFAS and health outcomes in children as well as to provide a risk of bias analysis of the literature. A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed for studies on PFAS and child health outcomes. We identified 64 studies for inclusion and performed risk of bias analysis on those studies. We determined that risk of bias across studies was low to moderate. Six categories of health outcomes emerged. These were: immunity/infection/asthma, cardio-metabolic, neurodevelopmental/attention, thyroid, renal, and puberty onset. While there are a limited number of studies for any one particular health outcome, there is evidence for positive associations between PFAS and dyslipidemia, immunity (including vaccine response and asthma), renal function, and age at menarche. One finding of note is that while PFASs are mixtures of multiple compounds few studies examine them as such, therefore the role of these compounds as complex mixtures remains largely unknown.

AB  - Per- or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a family of synthetic polyfluorinated compounds, are widely used in consumer products. Ubiquitous exposures to PFAS, in consideration of their persistence, bioaccumulation potential, and toxicities have led to concerns regarding possible harmful effects during critical periods of development in early-life and long-term consequences on health. The potential effects of PFAS depend on various factors including the type of PFAS and the timing and level of exposure. We performed a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature to assess the effects of early-life PFAS exposure on prenatal and postnatal growth, adiposity, and puberty in children and adolescents. For birth size, most studies indicated that prenatal PFAS exposure, in particular long-chain PFAS, may impair fetal growth, albeit some reports of null associations with maternal PFAS. For growth within 2 years of age, prenatal PFAS exposure showed no associations with height and either null or negative associations with weight. However, postnatal PFAS exposures were inversely related to height and weight at 2 years in a cross-sectional study. For postnatal adiposity, prenatal PFAS may mostly have negative associations with body mass index in the first 2 years of life, but positive relationships with adiposity in childhood and adolescence, although some studies showed null associations. For puberty, the evidence for associations between early-life PFAS exposure and pubertal development or sex hormone levels were limited and inconclusive. From experimental studies, plausible mechanisms through which PFAS may affect early-life growth and puberty include PFAS-induced activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, alterations of thyroid or steroid hormone synthesis and metabolism, and their weak estrogenic or anti-androgenic properties. Although the published literature suggests possible effects of PFAS exposures on early-life growth, adiposity, and puberty, current human evidence is limited in establishing PFAS-induced effects on early-life physical development. Further investigation is warranted to clarify PFAS-induced effects on growth and physical development in consideration of the critical time-window of exposure, concomitant exposure to chemical mixtures including various PFAS types, and possible non-monotonic dose-response relationship for growth and adiposity trajectories.

AB  - Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), ubiquitous persistent environmental contaminants, has led to substantial global concern due to their potential environmental and human health effects. Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between PFAS exposure and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the results are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFAS and MetS. We performed a systematic search strategy using three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies concerning the associations of PFAS with MetS and its clinical relevance from inception until January 2021. We undertook meta-analyses where there were five or more studies with exposure and outcomes assessments that were reasonably comparable. The pooled odd ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects models and heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 index and Q test. A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (10 studies on the general population and two studies in the occupational settings) investigated the association between PFAS exposure and MetS. We pooled data from seven studies on the general population for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and five studies for perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Predominately, most studies reported no statistically significant association between concentrations of PFAS and MetS. In the meta-analysis, the overall measure of effect was not statistically significant, showing no evidence of an association between concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS and the risk of MetS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, current small body of evidence does not support association between PFAS and MetS. However, due to limited number of studies and substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Further scrutinizing cohort studies are needed to evaluate the association between various and less well-known PFAS substances and their mixture with MetS and its components in both adults and children in different settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large group of manufactured nonbiodegradable compounds. Despite increasing awareness as global pollutants, the impact of PFAS exposure on human health is not well understood, and there are growing concerns for adverse effects on kidney function. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review to summarize and identify gaps in the understanding between PFAS exposure and kidney health. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO Global Health, World Health Organization Global Index, and Web of Science for studies published from 1990 to 2018. We included studies on the epidemiology, pharmacokinetics, or toxicology of PFAS exposure and kidney-related health, including clinical, histologic, molecular, and metabolic outcomes related to kidney disease, or outcomes related to the pharmacokinetic role of the kidneys. RESULTS: We identified 74 studies, including 21 epidemiologic, 13 pharmacokinetic, and 40 toxicological studies. Three population-based epidemiologic studies demonstrated associations between PFAS exposure and lower kidney function. Along with toxicology studies (n=10) showing tubular histologic and cellular changes from PFAS exposure, pharmacokinetic studies (n=5) demonstrated the kidneys were major routes of elimination, with active proximal tubule transport. In several studies (n=17), PFAS exposure altered several pathways linked to kidney disease, including oxidative stress pathways, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor pathways, NF-E2-related factor 2 pathways, partial epithelial mesenchymal transition, and enhanced endothelial permeability through actin filament modeling. CONCLUSIONS: A growing body of evidence portends PFASs are emerging environmental threats to kidney health; yet several important gaps in our understanding still exist.

TI  - Associations between Exposures to Perfluoroalkyl Substances and Diabetes, Hyperglycemia, or Insulin Resistance: A Scoping Review.
AU  - Margolis R
AU  - Sant KE
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent environmental pollutants that are commonly found in the human body due to exposures via drinking water, surfactants used in consumer materials, and aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs). PFAS exposure has been linked to adverse health effects such as low infant birth weights, cancer, and endocrine disruption, though increasingly studies have demonstrated that they may perturb metabolic processes and contribute to dysfunction. This scoping review summarizes the chemistry of PFAS exposure and the epidemiologic evidence for associations between exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and the development of diabetes, hyperglycemia, and/or insulin resistance. We identified 11 studies on gestational diabetes mellitus, 3 studies on type 1 diabetes, 7 studies on type 2 diabetes, 6 studies on prediabetes or unspecified diabetes, and 15 studies on insulin resistance or glucose tolerance using the SCOPUS and PubMed databases. Approximately 24 reported positive associations, 9 negative associations, 2 non-linear associations, and 2 inverse associations, and 8 reported no associations found between PFAS and all diabetes search terms. Cumulatively, these data indicate the need for further studies to better assess these associations between PFAS exposure and diabetes.

AB  - Posterior fossa abnormalities (PFAs) are commonly identified within routine screening and are a frequent indication for fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although biometric measurements of the posterior fossa (PF) are established on fetal ultrasound and MRI, qualitative visual assessments are predominantly used to differentiate PFAs. This systematic review aimed to assess 2-dimensional (2D) biometric measurements currently in use for assessing the PF on fetal MRI to delineate different PFAs. The protocol was registered (PROSPERO ID CRD42019142162). Eligible studies included T2-weighted MRI PF measurements in fetuses with and without PFAs, including measurements of the PF, or other brain areas relevant to PFAs. 59 studies were included - 6859 fetuses had 62 2D PF and related measurements. These included linear, area and angular measurements, representing measures of PF size, cerebellum/vermis, brainstem, and supratentorial measurements. 11 measurements were used in 10 or more studies and at least 1200 fetuses. These dimensions were used to characterise normal for gestational age, diagnose a range of pathologies, and predict outcome. A selection of validated 2D biometric measurements of the PF on fetal MRI may be useful for identification of PFA in different clinical settings. Consistent use of these measures, both clinically and for research, is recommended. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Humans are exposed to several per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) daily; however, most previous studies have focused on individual PFAS. Although attention to effects of exposure to mixtures of PFAS has grown in recent years, there is no consensus on the appropriate statistical methods that can be used to assess their combined effect on human health. OBJECTIVES: We aim to perform a comprehensive review of the statistical methods used in the existing studies which evaluate the association between exposure to mixtures of PFAS and any adverse human health effect. METHODS: The online databases PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched for eligible studies, published during the last ten years (last search performed on April 08, 2021). Covidence software was used by two different reviewers to perform a title/abstract screening, followed by a full text revision of the selected papers. RESULTS: A total of 3640 papers were identified, and after the screening process, 53 papers were included in the current review. Most of the studies were published between 2019 and 2021 and were conducted mainly in North America and Europe; more than half of the studies (28 out of 53) were conducted on mother and child pairs. WQS (Weighted Quantile Sum) Regression and BKMR (Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression) were used in 36 out of 53 papers to model mixtures' effects. Health outcomes included in the studies are immunotoxicity (n = 8), fetal development (n = 7), neurodevelopment (n = 9), reproductive hormones (n = 6), thyroid hormones (n = 7), outcomes related to metabolic pathways (n = 16). CONCLUSION: Studies on human exposure to PFAS as complex mixtures and health consequences have substantially increased in the last few years. Based on our findings, we propose that addressing risk from PFAS mixtures will likely require combinations of approaches and implementation of constantly evolving statistical methods. Specific guidelines and tools for quality assessment and publication of mixture observational studies are warranted.

AB  - Exposure to environmental pollutants may produce impairment of male reproductive health. The epidemiological literature evaluating potential consequences of human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has grown in recent years with concerns for both pre- and postnatal influences. The aim of this systematic review was to assess available evidence on associations between PFAS exposures in different stages of life and semen quality, reproductive hormones, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and testicular cancer. A systematic search of literature published prior to March 9th, 2020, was performed in the databases PubMed and Embase®. Predefined criteria for eligibility were applied by two authors screening study records independently. Among the 242 study records retrieved in the literature search, 26 studies were eligible for qualitative assessment. While several investigations suggested weak associations for single compounds and specific outcomes, a lack of consistency across studies limited conclusions of overall evidence. The current gap in knowledge is particularly obvious regarding exposures prior to adulthood, exposure to combinations of both PFAS and other types of environmental chemicals, and outcomes such as cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and testicular cancer. Continued efforts to clarify associations between PFAS exposure and male reproductive health through high-quality epidemiological studies are needed.

AB  - Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are found widespread in the environment and humans. The relation of PFASs to fertility has now been examined in a relatively large number of epidemiologic studies and a synthesis is in order. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFASs and measures of human fertility, with particular emphasis on perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Systematic literature searches were initially conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE and subsequently in references and citations of included papers. Studies were included if they assessed exposure to PFASs in biological samples in relation to reproductive hormones, semen characteristics, or time to pregnancy (TTP). Study characteristics and results were abstracted to predefined forms, and the studies were assessed for the risk of bias and confounding. Sixteen studies investigated the association between PFAS exposure in men and semen parameters, reproductive hormone levels, or TTP. There was a lack of consistent results among the numerous investigated exposure-outcome combinations. However, subtle associations between higher PFOS and lower testosterone or abnormal semen morphology cannot be excluded. Eleven studies assessed the association between PFAS exposure in women and TTP or reproductive hormones levels. Four of eight studies found prolonged TTP with higher PFOS or PFOA, but only one study found an association when restricting to nulliparous women. In men, there is little evidence of an association between PFAS exposure and semen quality or levels of reproductive hormones. For PFOS and PFOA, the literature indicates an association with female fecundability in parous women, which is most likely not causal.

AB  - Numerous studies have explored the associations between environmental pollutants and pediatric health. Recent studies have investigated the issue in Asia, but no systematic review has been published to date. This study aims to elucidate the issue by summarizing relevant epidemiologic evidence for cohorts in Asia, using information from the Birth Cohort Consortium of Asia (BiCCA). Environmental pollutants include mercury, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and phthalates. This study sought to classify the effects of such compounds on fetal growth and pregnancy outcomes, neurodevelopment and behavioral problems, allergic disease and immune function and the endocrine system and puberty. These evidences showed ETS has been associated with infant birth weight, children's neurodevelopment and allergy disease; mercury and PCB have been shown to affect children's neurodevelopment; phthalate has effects on endocrine function; PFAS alters children's neurodevelopment, the endocrine system, and the allergic response. However, more consistent and coordinated research is necessary to understand the whole picture of single environmental and/or co-exposure and children's health. Therefore, harmonization and international collaboration are also needed in Asia.

AB  - Proximal femoral arthroplasty (PFA) is an established treatment modality following oncological resection. Increasingly, these prostheses are being used for non-neoplastic conditions such as fractures and bone loss associated with septic or aseptic loosening. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the failure rates, mortality rates and hip outcome scores when PFAs were used in non-neoplastic conditions. There were 14 studies with an average follow-up of 3.8 years (range 0-14 years) describing 356 PFAs. Re-operation for any reason occurred in 23.8% (85/356) of cases. The most common complications were dislocation (15.7%) and infection (7.6%). The mortality rate ranged from 0% to 40%. PFA provides an acceptable surgical solution when confronted with massive bone loss, but it has a high re-operation rate for dislocation and infection.

AB  - Background: Exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) is ubiquitous in most regions of the world. The most commonly studied PFASs are perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Animal studies indicate that maternal PFAS exposure is associated with reduced fetal growth. However, the results of human studies are inconsistent. Objectives: To summarize the evidence of an association between exposure to PFASs, particularly PFOS and PFOA, and human fetal growth. Methods: Systematic literature searches were performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE. We included original studies on pregnant women with measurements of PFOA or PFOS in maternal blood during pregnancy or the umbilical cord and associations with birth weight or related outcomes according to the PFAS level. Citations and references from the included articles were investigated to locate more relevant articles. Study characteristics and results were extracted to structured tables. The completeness of reporting as well as the risk of bias and confounding were assessed. Results: Fourteen studies were eligible. In utero PFOA exposure was associated with decreased measures of continuous birth weight in all studies, even though the magnitude of the association differed and many results were statistically insignificant. PFOS exposure and birth weight were associated in some studies, while others found no association. Conclusions: Higher PFOS and PFOA concentrations were associated with decreased average birth weight in most studies, but only some results were statistically significant. The impact on public health is unclear, but the global exposure to PFASs warrants further investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) during pregnancy has been suggested to be associated with adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes; however, the findings have been inconsistent. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overview of these associations. METHODS: The online databases PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched comprehensively for eligible studies from inception to February 2021. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random- or fixed-effects models, and dose-response meta-analyses were also conducted when possible. FINDINGS: A total of 29 studies (32,905 participants) were included. The pooled results demonstrated that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure during pregnancy was linearly associated with increased preterm birth risk (pooled OR per 1-ng/ml increase: 1.01, 95% CIs: 1.00-1.02, P = 0.009) and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) exposure showed inverted U-shaped associations with preterm birth risk (P values for the nonlinear trend: 0.025 and 0.030). Positive associations were also observed for exposure to perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) and miscarriage (pooled OR per 1-ng/ml increase: 1.87, 95% CIs: 1.15-3.03) and PFOS and preeclampsia (pooled OR per 1-log increase: 1.27, 95% CIs: 1.06-1.51), whereas exposure to perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA) was inversely associated with preeclampsia risk (pooled OR per 1-log increase: 0.81, 95% CIs: 0.71-0.93). Based on individual evidence, detrimental effects were observed between PFDA exposure and small for gestational age and between PFOA and PFOS and intrauterine growth restriction. No significant associations were found between pregnancy PFAS exposure and other adverse pregnancy outcomes (i.e., gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced hypertension, low birth weight, and large and small for gestational age). INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicated that PFOS, PFOA and PFNA exposure during pregnancy might be associated with increased preterm birth risk and that PFAS exposure might be associated with the risk of miscarriage and preeclampsia. Due to the limited evidence obtained for most associations, additional studies are required to confirm these findings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many people are exposed to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) because these substances are widely used as industrial products. Although epidemiological studies suggest that PFASs can disrupt thyroid hormones, the association between PFAS exposure and thyroid function remains inconclusive. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and thyroid hormones. METHODS: We searched medical literature databases for articles on the association between PFASs-perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS)-and thyroid hormone levels in adults. Twelve articles were included in the meta-analysis, and the pooled z values were calculated with correlation or regression coefficients. RESULTS: The blood PFOS concentration was positively correlated with free T4. The pooled z value was 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03, 0.08). PFOS was negatively correlated with total T4 and total T3 when excluding outlier studies. In a subgroup analysis stratified by mean PFOS concentration, PFOS was observed to be positively associated with free T4 and TSH and negatively associated with total T3 in the intermediate concentration group (8-16 ng/mL). PFOA concentration was negatively correlated with total T4 (z value, -0.06; 95% CI: -0.09, -0.03) after omitting one outlier study. PFHxS also showed a negative correlation with total T4 (z value, -0.04; 95% CI: -0.07, -0.01). A subgroup analysis of pregnant women showed that there was no association between PFASs and thyroid hormones. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that PFASs are negatively associated with total T4, and their effect can be different depending on the PFAS concentration.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thyroid hormones (THs) are especially important for brain maturation and development during the fetal period and childhood. Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and thyroid outcomes during the early stages of life. We aimed to review this evidence. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review in compliance with the PRISMA Statement (search conducted in PubMed and Embase, as well as in the citations of the selected articles). We chose studies if they dealt with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin (T4), or thyroid dysfunctions, and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measured in the blood of pregnant women and/or children up to 19years old. RESULTS: We included in this review three cross-sectional, one case-control, and six cohort studies (publication: 2011-2015), focusing on prenatal life (n=7), childhood (n=2) or both periods (n=1). We observed a high degree of heterogeneity across studies in terms of sampling time (different gestational weeks, at birth, or childhood), outcomes, adjustment for potential confounders, and statistical approach. We found some evidence of a positive association between PFHxS and PFOS exposure and TSH levels measured in maternal blood, and PFNA and TSH levels measured in the blood of boys aged ≥11years. CONCLUSION: Although there is a small number of studies with comparable data, we found some consistency of a positive association between maternal or teenage male exposure to some PFAS and TSH levels based on the current literature. However, further studies are required to confirm these possible relationships.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations between prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and childhood obesity. We focused on organochlorines (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT], dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE], hexachlorobenzene [HCB], and polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]), perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) that are the POPs more widely studied in environmental birth cohorts so far. We search two databases (PubMed and Embase) through July/09/2021 and identified 33 studies reporting associations with prenatal organochlorine exposure, 21 studies reporting associations with prenatal PFAS, and five studies reporting associations with prenatal PBDEs. We conducted a qualitative review. Additionally, we performed random-effects meta-analyses of POP exposures, with data estimates from at least three prospective studies, and BMI-z. Prenatal DDE and HCB levels were associated with higher BMI z-score in childhood (beta: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.21; I2 : 28.1% per study-specific log increase of DDE and beta: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.53; I2 : 31.9% per study-specific log increase of HCB). No significant associations between PCB-153, PFOA, PFOS, or pentaPBDEs with childhood BMI were found in meta-analyses. In individual studies, there was inconclusive evidence that POP levels were positively associated with other obesity indicators (e.g., waist circumference).

AB  - Thyroid hormone homeostasis is essential for normal brain development in fetuses and infants. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to organochlorine (β coefficient, -0.022; 95% CI, -0.04 to -0.003) and PFAS (β coefficient, -0.017; 95% CI, -0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to organochlorine and PFAS may be associated with lower neonatal TT4 level.

AB  - PURPOSE: Historically poor results of survivorship and functional outcomes of patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) have been reported in the setting of isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis. More recently, however, fairly good results of PFA were reported, but the current status of PFA outcomes is unknown. Therefore, a systematic review was performed to assess overall PFA survivorship and functional outcomes. METHODS: A search was performed using PubMed, Embase and Cochrane systems, and the registries were searched. Twenty-three cohort studies and one registry reported survivorship using Kaplan-Meier curve, while 51 cohort studies reported functional outcomes of PFA. RESULTS: Twelve studies were level II studies, while 45 studies were level III or IV studies. Heterogeneity was mainly seen in type of prosthesis and year the cohort started. Nine hundred revisions in 9619 PFAs were reported yielding 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-year PFA survivorships of 91.7, 83.3, 74.9 and 66.6 %, respectively, and an annual revision rate of 2.18. Functional outcomes were reported in 2587 PFAs with an overall score of 82.2 % of the maximum score. KSS and Knee Function Score were 87.5 and 81.6 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: This systematic review showed that fairly good results of PFA survivorship and functional outcomes were reported at short- and midterm follow-up in the setting of isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis. Heterogeneity existed mainly in prosthesis design and year the cohort started. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results provide a clear overview of the current status of PFA in the setting of isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.

AB  - Some studies have shown that maternal perfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS) exposure may be associated with low birth weight (LBW) of offspring. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the association between maternal PFASs exposure and LBW in offspring. The researchers searched PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Embase to find all the articles before October 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the studies. Finally, six articles were included for meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis showed no significant correlation between maternal perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure and LBW of offspring: odds ratio (OR) = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.80-1.01, with low heterogeneity (I2 = 18.4%, P = 0.289); there was a significant positive correlation between maternal perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure and LBW of offspring (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.09-1.55) with no heterogeneity (I2 = 0.00%, P = 0.570). The grouping analysis of PFOS showed was a significant positive correlation between maternal PFOS exposure and LBW of offspring in American (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.15-1.72). This study provided a systematic review and meta-analysis evidence for the relationship between maternal PFASs exposure and LBW of offspring through a small number of studies. Researchers should conduct further studies between different regions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite increasing regulation, exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) remains a serious public health concern due to their accumulation in the environment and ability to biomagnify up the food chain. POPs are associated with endocrine-disrupting effects including adverse reproductive outcomes that could affect fecundability, i.e. the capacity to conceive a pregnancy, quantified as time to pregnancy (TTP). OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Results of epidemiologic studies that examine the impact of various chemical classes of POPs on TTP have not been synthesised. We undertook a systematic review to summarise the strength of evidence for associations of four common groups of POPs with couple fecundability and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature in order to inform policy decisions and future research. SEARCH METHODS: We performed an electronic search of literature published between 1 January 2007 and 6 August 2019 in MEDLINE, EMBASE.com, Global Health, DART/TOXLINE and POPLINE. We included empirical research papers that examined human exposure to organochlorine (OC) pesticides, brominated flame retardants, polychlorinated organic compounds and/or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and considered TTP or fecundability as an outcome. Standardised forms for screening, data extraction and study quality were developed using DistillerSR software, and all reviews were completed in duplicate. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias and devised additional quality metrics based on specific methodological features of fecundability studies. OUTCOMES: The search returned 4573 articles, and 28 papers from 19 different studies met inclusion criteria. Among them, four studies measured TTP prospectively, three had data on participants' prenatal exposure, three examined associations in both male and female partners and one focused exclusively on males. Analyses varied widely in terms of exposure characterisation, precluding a meta-analytic approach. Evidence was strongest for adverse associations of female exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls with TTP, with some additional support for associations of female exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers and PFAS with longer TTP. Our review provided little or no support for associations between female exposure to OC pesticides or male exposure to any of the POP groups and TTP. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Evidence suggests that female exposure to at least some POPs may reduce fecundability. Although many of these chemicals are no longer in production, they are still detectable in human biosamples because of their persistence in the environment. Replacement chemicals that are being introduced as older ones are restricted may have similar reproductive consequences. Future studies should examine these newer POPs, assess interactions between POPs and other chemical and non-chemical exposures, investigate how POPs are distributed in and metabolised by the human body and focus on populations that may be disproportionately exposed.

AB  - We performed genome-wide meta-analysis of lipid traits on three samples of Mexican and Mexican American ancestry comprising 4,383 individuals, and followed up significant and highly suggestive associations in three additional Hispanic samples comprising 7,876 individuals. Genome-wide significant signals were observed in or near CELSR2, ZNF259/APOA5, KANK2/DOCK6 and NCAN/MAU2 for total cholesterol, LPL, ABCA1, ZNF259/APOA5, LIPC and CETP for HDL cholesterol, CELSR2, APOB and NCAN/MAU2 for LDL cholesterol, and GCKR, TRIB1, ZNF259/APOA5 and NCAN/MAU2 for triglycerides. Linkage disequilibrium and conditional analyses indicate that signals observed at ABCA1 and LIPC for HDL cholesterol and NCAN/MAU2 for triglycerides are independent of previously reported lead SNP associations. Analyses of lead SNPs from the European Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC) dataset in our Hispanic samples show remarkable concordance of direction of effects as well as strong correlation in effect sizes. A meta-analysis of the European GLGC and our Hispanic datasets identified five novel regions reaching genome-wide significance: two for total cholesterol (FN1 and SAMM50), two for HDL cholesterol (LOC100996634 and COPB1) and one for LDL cholesterol (LINC00324/CTC1/PFAS). The top meta-analysis signals were found to be enriched for SNPs associated with gene expression in a tissue-specific fashion, suggesting an enrichment of tissue-specific function in lipid-associated loci.

TI  - Trace metals and persistent organic pollutants contamination in batoids (Chondrichthyes: Batoidea): A systematic review.
AU  - Bezerra MF
AU  - Lacerda LD
AU  - Lai CT
AB  - Batoids (Chondrichthyes: Batoidea; e.g. stingrays, skates, and guitarfish) comprise more than 55% of elasmobranch taxa and represent ecologically important predators in benthic and pelagic habitats. Although overexploitation and habitat degradation are the two biggest threats to batoid populations, coastal and oceanic pollution is also a pervasive potential threat. In this systematic review, we compile published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea superorder and present contamination patterns, exposure effects, and potential human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found batoids to accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Accumulation of POPs is reported for chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Hg levels in muscle tissue were significantly different among oceanic basins and habitats, consistent with previous global assessments of Hg oceanic background levels. Some batoid species presented Hg levels higher than large pelagic teleost fishes and comparable to sharks. Ecological traits such as, bottom feeding, upper trophic position and elasmobranch-specific physiology and metabolism are discussed as potential factors associated with Hg uptake and accumulation in batoids. Some species exceeded USEPA's maximum contamination safety limits in edible tissues for Hg, As and ΣPCBs. For most trace metals and POPs, there is a lack of studies focusing on contamination levels in batoids. We recommend future research increasing reporting on POPs and trace metals besides Hg in batoids to further investigate the role of Elasmobranch as a bioindicator for marine pollution.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Existing evidence suggests that perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exposure might contribute to the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis to identify the association between PFAS and the risk of GDM. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for appropriate articles about the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of GDM before September 28, 2020. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized by Stata 16.0 through fixed effect models according to heterogeneity. We also carried out subgroup analyses by geographic location, blood sampling time of subjects, method of chemical analysis, study design, sample size, and sampling year. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the robustness of the results. RESULTS: A total of eight studies involving 5654 pregnant women were included in the meta-analysis. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was positively and significantly associated with the risk of GDM (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02-1.59). Exposure to other types of PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of GDM with the pooled effect estimates of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86-1.09), 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86-1.24), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55-1.16) respectively. CONCLUSION: We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and GDM and found that PFOA concentration was significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of GDM in public health. Further studies are needed in order to establish causality and clarify the potential mechanism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patellofemoral Arthroplasty (PFA) has been shown to be successful in restoring knee function and quality of life in patients with isolated patellofemoral disease. Patient satisfaction has been suggested as an indicator of the quality of elective orthopedic operations, although there remains no standardized method to collect and evaluate satisfaction. The present study offers a systematic review of the available literature concerning patient satisfaction following PFA to assess common methodologies for reporting patient satisfaction. METHODS: A query of the Medline database produced 116 articles that were reviewed for inclusion in the review. The following inclusion criteria were used to identify suitable articles: English language, clinical outcomes study related to PFA, and patient-reported satisfaction as an outcome measure. RESULTS: Seven studies met inclusion criteria and were eligible for review. The highest level of evidence was level-III. The study publication dates ranged from 2009-2016, with six published in 2015 & 2016. In total, 320 PFAs were performed on 267 patients. Four articles reported the proportion of included patients who had previous knee surgeries (range: 20%-60%). Three studies used ordinal scales to rate patient satisfaction. Four studies (57.1%) reported the numeric proportion of patients satisfied following PFA, which ranged from 76% to 96.5%. Two studies used Visual Analog Scale methods. For these two studies, one of them reported the mean satisfaction score as 7.5/10, and the other reported a median of 90/100. CONCLUSIONS: The available literature on patient satisfaction after PFA was found to be limited, with low-quality evidence and variable methodology.

AU  - Harper KD
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) for isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (OA) remains controversial due to variable postoperative outcomes and high failure rates. Second-generation (2G) onlay prostheses have been associated with improved postoperative outcomes. This systematic review was performed to assess the current overall survivorship and functional outcomes of 2G PFA. METHODS: A search was performed using PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Thirty-three studies published in the last 15 years (2005-2020) were included; of these 22 studies reported patient-reported outcome measures. Operative and nonoperative complications were analyzed. Pooled statistical analysis was performed for survivorship and functional scores using Excel 2016 and Stata 13. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 59.7. When analyzing all studies, weighted survival at mean follow-up of 5.52 was 87.72%. Subanalysis of studies with minimum 5 years of follow up showed a survival of 94.24%. Fifteen studies reported Oxford Knee Score with a weighted mean postoperative Oxford Knee Score of 33.59. Mean American Knee Society Score pain was 79.7 while mean American Knee Society Score function was 79.3. The most common operative complication was OA progression for all implants. The percentage of revisions and conversions reported after analyzing all studies was 1.37% and 7.82% respectively. CONCLUSION: Safe and acceptable results of functional outcomes and PFA survivorship can result from 2G PFAs at both short and mid-term follow-up for patients with isolated patellofemoral OA. However, long-term follow-up outcomes are still pending for the newer implants. More extensive studies using standardized functional outcomes and long-term cost benefits should be evaluated.

AB  - Research on the environment, health, and well-being nexus (EHWB) is shifting from a silo toward a systemic approach that includes the socio-economic context. To disentangle further the complex interplay between the socio-exposome and internal chemical exposure, we performed a meta-analysis of human biomonitoring (HBM) studies with internal exposure data on per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and detailed information on risk factors, including descriptors of socio-economic status (SES) of the study population. PFASs are persistent in nature, and some have endocrine-disrupting properties. Individual studies have shown that HBM biomarker concentrations of PFASs generally increase with SES indicators, e.g., for income. Based on a meta-analysis (five studies) of the associations between PFASs and SES indicators, the magnitude of the association could be estimated. For the SES indicator income, changes in income were expressed by a factor change, which was corrected by the Gini coefficient to take into account the differences in income categories between studies, and the income range between countries. For the SES indicator education, we had to conclude that descriptors (<college, x years of study, etc.) differed too widely between studies to perform a meta-analysis. Therefore, the use of the uniform ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education) is recommended in future studies. The meta-analysis showed that a higher income is associated with a higher internal exposure to PFASs (PFOS or perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, PFOA or perfluorooctanoic acid, PFNA or perfluorononanoic acid, PFHxS or perfluorohexane sulfonate). This is opposite to the environmental justice hypothesis, referring to an inequitable distribution of detrimental environmental effects toward poor and minority communities by a practice or policy. With a doubling of the income, internal exposure increased on average by 10%⁻14%. Possible explanations for this difference are given, e.g., underlying differences in diet. However, other sources can also contribute, and the exact causes of SES-related differences in PFAS concentrations remain unclear. Studies are needed that include social descriptors together with lifestyle and dietary information as explanatory variables for internal chemical exposure levels. This will help clarify the underlying factors that link SES with inequity to environmental exposures, and will raise awareness and knowledge to strengthen the capacities of people and communities to advocate chemical exposure reduction in order to reduce this health inequity.

AU  - Kingdon, Danielle
AU  - Cardoso, Christopher
AU  - McGrath, Jennifer J.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like symptoms are common in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). FASD and ADHD groups both display executive function impairments; however, there is ongoing debate whether the pattern and magnitude of executive function deficits differs between these two types of disorders. METHODS: An electronic literature search was conducted (PubMed, PsychInfo; 1972–2013) to identify studies comparing the executive functioning of children with FASD with ADHD or control groups. FASD groups included those with and without dysmorphy (i.e., FAS, pFAS, ARND, and other FASD diagnoses). Effect sizes (Hedges’ g, standardized mean difference) were calculated. Random effects meta-analytic models were performed using the metafor package for R. RESULTS: Fifty-one studies met inclusion criteria (FASD N = 2,115; ADHD N = 453; controls N = 1,990). Children with FASD showed the strongest and most consistent deficits in planning, fluency, and set-shifting compared to controls (Hedges’ g = -0.94, -0.78) and children with ADHD (Hedges’ g = -0.72, -0.32). FASD was associated with moderate to large impairments in working memory, compared to controls (Hedges’ g = -.84, -.58) and small impairments relative to groups with ADHD (Hedges’ g = -.26). Smaller and less consistent deficits were found on measures of inhibition and vigilance relative to controls (Hedges’ g = -0.52, -0.31); FASD and ADHD were not differentiated on these measures. Moderator analyses indicated executive dysfunction was associated with older age, dysmorphy, and larger group differences in IQ. Sex and diagnostic system were not consistently related to effect size. CONCLUSIONS: While FASD is associated with global executive impairments, executive function weaknesses are most consistent for measures of planning, fluency, and set-shifting. Neuropsychological measures assessing these executive function domains may improve differential diagnosis and treatment of FASD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Endocrine disrupting chemicals and breast cancer: a systematic review of epidemiological studies.
AU  - Wan MLY
AU  - Co VA
AU  - El-Nezami H
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) are ubiquitous substances that are found in our everyday lives, including pesticides, plasticizers, pharmaceutical agents, personal care products, and also in food products and food packaging. Increasing epidemiological evidence suggest that EDCs may affect the development or progression of breast cancer and consequently lead to lifelong harmful health consequences, especially when exposure occurs during early life in humans. Yet so far no appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review all the available epidemiological studies about the association of the levels of environmental exposures of EDCs with breast cancer risk. METHODS: The search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved articles from PubMed (MEDLINE) until 10 March 2021. The key words used in this research were: "Endocrine disruptor(s)" OR "Endocrine disrupting chemical(s)" OR any of the EDCs mentioned below AND "Breast cancer" to locate all relevant articles published. We included only cohort studies and case-control studies. All relevant articles were accessed in full text and were evaluated and summarized in tables. RESULTS: We identified 131 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. EDCs reviewed herein included pesticides (e.g. p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), atrazine, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin)), synthetic chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), parabens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contraceptive pills), phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein, resveratrol), and certain mycotoxins (e.g. zearalenone). Most studies assessed environmental EDCs exposure via biomarker measurements. CONCLUSION: We identified certain EDC exposures could potentially elevate the risk of breast cancer. As majority of EDCs are highly persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative, it is essential to assess the long-term impacts of EDC exposures, especially multi-generational and transgenerational. Also, since food is often a major route of exposure to EDCs, well-designed exposure assessments of potential EDCs in food and food packing are necessary and their potential link to breast cancer development need to be carefully evaluated for subsequent EDC policy making and regulations.

AB  - Humans and ecological species have been found to have detectable body burdens of a number of perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAA) including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). In mouse and rat liver these compounds elicit transcriptional and phenotypic effects similar to peroxisome proliferator chemicals (PPC) that work through the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha). Recent studies indicate that along with PPAR alpha other nuclear receptors are required for transcriptional changes in the mouse liver after PFOA exposure including the constitutive activated receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) that regulate xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XME). To determine the potential role of CAR/PXR in mediating effects of PFAAs in rat liver, we performed a meta-analysis of transcript profiles from published studies in which rats were exposed to PFOA or PFOS. We compared the profiles to those produced by exposure to prototypical activators of CAR, (phenobarbital (PB)), PXR (pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN)), or PPAR alpha (WY-14,643 (WY)). As expected, PFOA and PFOS elicited transcript profile signatures that included many known PPAR alpha target genes. Numerous XME genes were also altered by PFOA and PFOS but not WY. These genes exhibited expression changes shared with PB or PCN. Reexamination of the transcript profiles from the livers of chicken or fish exposed to PFAAs indicated that PPAR alpha, CAR, and PXR orthologs were not activated. Our results indicate that PFAAs under these experimental conditions activate PPAR alpha, CAR, and PXR in rats but not chicken and fish. Lastly, we discuss evidence that human populations with greater CAR expression have lower body burdens of PFAAs.

AB  - Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are non-biodegradable synthetic chemical compounds that are widely used in manufacturing many household products. Many studies have reported the association between PFCs exposure with the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, those reports are still debatable, due to their findings. Thus, this review paper aimed to analyse the association of PFCs compound with CVDs and their risk factors in humans by systematic review and meta-analysis. Google Scholar, PubMed and ScienceDirect were searched for PFCs studies on CVDs and their risk from 2009 until present. The association of PFCs exposure with the prevalence of CVDs and their risk factors were assessed by calculating the quality criteria, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). CVDs risk factors were divided into serum lipid profile (main risk factor) and other known risk factors. The meta-analysis was then used to derive a combined OR test for heterogeneity in findings between studies. Twenty-nine articles were included. Our meta-analysis indicated that PFCs exposure could be associated with CVDs (Test for overall effect: z = 2.2, p = 0.02; Test for heterogeneity: I2 = 91.6%, CI = 0.92-1.58, p < 0.0001) and their risk factors (Test for overall effect: z = 4.03, p < 0.0001; Test for heterogeneity: I2 = 85.8%, CI = 1.00-1.14, p < 0.0001). In serum lipids, total cholesterol levels are frequently reported associated with the exposure of PFCs. Among PFCs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) exposure increased the risk of CVDs than other types of PFCs. Although the risk of PFOA and PFOS were positively associated with CVDs and their risk factors, more observational studies shall be carried out to identify the long-term effects of these contaminants in premature CVDs development in patients.

TI  - Exposure to Perfluoroalkyl Substances and Allergic Outcomes in Children: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
AU  - Luo Y
AU  - Deji Z
AU  - Huang Z
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent organic pollutants and widespread throughout the environment. Although exposure to PFASs may contribute to the development of allergic diseases in children, evidence about this association remains inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between PFASs exposure and allergic diseases in children based on current evidence. METHODS: The databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched to identify all observational studies that examined the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of childhood allergic diseases. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of case-crossover studies, and a previously validated quality assessment framework was used for observational studies lacking control groups. Random-effects meta-analysis models were applied to pool odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: From an initial 94 articles (after duplicate removal), 13 studies through full-text assessment were included for quantitative assessment and descriptive synthesis. They are ten cohort studies, two cross-sectional studies, and one case-control study. The pooled estimates showed that perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was associated with eczema (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.80-0.99), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) with atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.01-1.58), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) with allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.13-1.56). However, no such significant associations were found for wheeze and asthma. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis results suggest that PFASs exposure could potentially be associated with eczema, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis during childhood, but not with childhood asthma or wheeze. Future studies are needed to verify these findings.

AB  - Some articles have examined perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure in early life in relation to risk of childhood adiposity. Nevertheless, the results from epidemiological studies exploring the associations remain inconsistent and contradictory. We thus conducted an analysis of data currently available to examine the association between PFOA exposure in early life and risk of childhood adiposity. The PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify studies that examined the impact of PFOA exposure in early life on childhood adiposity. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to pool the statistical estimates. We identified ten prospective cohort studies comprising 6076 participants with PFOA exposure. The overall effect size (relative risk or odds ratio) for childhood overweight was 1.25 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.50; I² = 40.5%). In addition, exposure to PFOA in early life increased the z-score of childhood body mass index (β = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.17; I² = 27.9%). Accordingly, exposure to PFOA in early life is associated with an increased risk for childhood adiposity. Further research is needed to verify these findings and to shed light on the molecular mechanism of PFOA in adiposity.

AB  - China has gradually become the most important manufacturing and consumption centre for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the world, and inadvertently become the world's major contamination hotspots. However, a systematic analysis of pollution pathways for PFOS/PFOA into the different environmental compartments and their quantification in China has yet to be carried out. This study focused on PFOS and PFOA release into the environment in the central and eastern region of China, which accounts for the vast majority of national emission. About 80-90% of PFOS/PFOA contamination in the Chinese environment was estimated to come directly from manufacturing and industrial sites mostly via wastewater discharge from these facilities. The other major contamination sources for PFOS were identified as being linked to aqueous fire-fighting foams (AFFFs), and pesticides including sulfluramid. For PFOA, following some way behind industrial wastewater, were industrial exhaust gas, domestic wastewater and landfill leachate as contamination sources. For surface water contamination, the major pollution contributors after industrial wastewater were AFFF spill runoff for PFOS, and domestic wastewater and precipitation-runoff for PFOA. The majority of PFOS that contaminated soil was considered to be linked with infiltration of AFFF and pesticides, while most PFOA in soil was attributed to atmospheric deposition and landfill leachate. Where groundwater had become contaminated, surface water seepage was estimated to contribute about 50% of PFOS and 40% of PFOA while the remainder was mostly derived from soil leaching. A review of the available monitoring data for PFOS/PFOA in the literature supported the view that industrial wastewater, landfill leachate and AFFF application were the dominant sources. Higher concentrations of PFOA than PFOS found in precipitation also corroborated the prediction of more PFOA release into air. To reduce PFOS/PFOA contamination of the Chinese environment the focus for control should be on industrial wastewater emissions.

AB  - Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), a class of persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals, are widely used in consumer products due to their unique amphiphilic properties. Previous epidemiological studies suggest association of maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes, while evidences about the association are inconsistent. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the relationship of maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Twenty-one relevant studies were identified from three databases before 2020. The quality, heterogeneity and possibility of publication bias of included studies were evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, Q-statistic and Begg's test, respectively. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained by means of random-effects meta-analysis models. Meta-analysis results revealed that maternal exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) may have a positive association with preterm birth (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.38). The pooled estimates also showed limited evidence of association between maternal perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure and miscarriage (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 0.92, 2.38) with obvious heterogeneity (I2 = 93.9, p < 0.01). However, no such significant associations were found between the other PFASs and miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth. In addition, the subgroup analyses showed that studies on the relationship of maternal PFASs exposure and miscarriage were mainly contributed by developed countries. The meta-analysis results indicated maternal exposure to PFOS can increase the risk of preterm birth. The results of the included studies are inconsistent and the effects of PFASs on human health are complex. Further studies with enough samples are required to verify these findings.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Perfluorobutane ultrasound contrast agent as a new type of contrast agent has a good performance in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aim to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of Perfluorobutane contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (P-CEUS) in the diagnosis of HCC with a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane, Clinical Key, Wan Fang, CBM and CNKI databases were systematically searched and checked for studies using P-CEUS in HCC, from 2007 to 2020. Data necessary to construct 2 × 2 contingency tables were extracted from included studies. The QUADAS tool was utilized to assess the methodologic quality of the studies. Meta-analysis included data pooling, subgroup analyses, meta-regression and investigation of publication bias was comprehensively performed. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in this meta-analysis and the overall diagnostic accuracy in characterization of HCC was as follows: pooled sensitivity, 0.90 (95% confidence interval: 0.82-0.95); pooled specificity, 0.97 (0.93-0.98); pooled positive likelihood ratio, 27.2 (14.1 to - 52.3); and pooled negative likelihood ratio, 0.10 (0.06-0.18). The area under the comprehensive receiving operation characteristic curve was 0.98 (0.97-0.99). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity and specificity of P-CEUS are more valuable than other imaging techniques (such as computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging). However, due to the large differences in the data samples collected in this study, statistical heterogeneity results. P-CEUS can significantly improve the diagnostic efficiency of previous contrast-enhanced ultrasound for HCC. PROSPERO registration number: PROSPERO (CRD42020200040).

TI  - Neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioural effects of polybrominated and perfluorinated chemicals: a systematic review of the epidemiological literature using a quality assessment scheme.
AU  - Roth N
AU  - Wilks MF
AB  - Concerns over effects of halogenated persistent environmental contaminants on the developing brain have been expressed for many years, and human biomonitoring has confirmed that low-level, prenatal and/or postnatal exposure of children to these chemicals is ubiquitous. Over the last decade there have been increasing reports in the epidemiological literature of the potential association of exposure to polybromo diphenylethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) with neurodevelopmental and/or neurobehavioural effects in infants and children, such as adverse birth outcomes, cognitive deficits, developmental delay and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). However, direct evidence from epidemiology studies has been limited and contradictory. Given the general lack of comparability across studies in terms of design, conduct, methodology and reporting, we developed a checklist-type quality assessment scheme based on the STROBE guidelines and the proposed HONEES criteria, and conducted a systematic review of the epidemiological peer-reviewed literature published since 2006 on neurodevelopmental and/or neurobehavioural effects following prenatal and postnatal exposure to PBDEs and PFCs. We rated 7 of the 18 studies that met our inclusion criteria as being of high quality, 7 of moderate quality and 4 of low quality. Frequently observed shortcomings were the lack of consideration of confounding factors; uncertainties regarding exposure characterization; inadequate sample size; the lack of a clear dose-response; and the representativeness/generalizability of the results. Collectively, the epidemiological evidence does currently not support a strong causal association between PBDEs and PFCs and adverse neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioural outcomes in infants and children. However, despite their limitations, the studies raise questions that require further investigation through hypothesis-driven studies using more harmonized study designs and methodologies, more detailed exposure assessments and repeated testing with larger study populations.

AB  - Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is an artificial organic substance widely used for decades, which seriously threatens human health. This study aimed to identify human-relevant correlates between PFOA exposure and the male rodent reproductive system. We performed a systematic literature review of the relevant literature of PubMed, Cochrane Library databases, Web of Science and Embase from the establishment to April 2020. Studies included the effects of PFOA on the reproductive system of male rodents. The meta-analysis was performed on the basis of the following points: level of testosterone and estradiol in serum, development of reproductive organs, pathological changes of reproduction organs and parameters of semen. A series of 16 studies was enrolled in this study. The standard mean difference (SMD) for PFOA-related reproductive toxicity was summarised as -0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71, -0.07). The lower serum testosterone levels, decreased absolute testicular and epididymal weights, higher serum estradiol levels, elevated relative testicular and seminal vesicle weights and increased incidence of Leydig cell adenoma and percentage of abnormal sperm were observed in the exposed group compared with the control group. However, no statistical difference was found in the day of preputial separation of pups and percentage of motile sperm. In conclusion, PFOA exposure heightens the reproductive system damage in male rodents. However, many studies included in the review did not identify mechanisms by which PFOA induces changes to the male reproductive system, which is an area for additional study.

AB  - Some studies have shown that maternal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may be associated with early attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to verify this association by reviewing existing studies and to provide a strong basis for preventing ADHD. The researchers searched electronic databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Embase for all studies published before October 2020. Finally, we included nine articles for analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that maternal exposure to PFASs was not significantly associated with the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD (perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), odds ratio (OR) = 1.00, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.75-1.25; perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.88-1.14; perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.80-1.09; perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.99-1.28; perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.15-2.32). Due to significant heterogeneity, we subsequently performed subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. Through subgroup analysis, we found that PFOS concentration of children's blood and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD were statistically positively correlated, and there was also a positive correlation between PFOS exposure and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD in the America. Moreover, there was also a statistically positive correlation between PFNA concentration in maternal blood and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD. Sensitivity analysis showed that the final results did not change much, the sensitivity was low, and the results were relatively stable. In conclusion, a causal relationship between maternal PFASs exposure and ADHD in children was unlikely. Among them, PFOS, PFNA, and ADHD might have positive associations worthy of further investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a non-invasive method for the assessment of breast lesions. The accuracy of CEUS in diagnosing of breast cancer has never been systematically assessed. PURPOSE: To determine the overall performance of CEUS in the differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions using meta-analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and article references published before October 2012 were searched. Published studies that used histopathologic results as golden reference to assess the diagnostic performance of CEUS in patients suspected of having breast cancer and the data necessary to calculate the diagnostic results were included. The qualities of eligible studies for final meta-analysis were assessed by using the quality assessment of diagnostic studies (QUADAS) instrument. Sensitivity, specificity, summary receiver-operating characteristic (sROC) curves, and area under the curve were calculated to examine the diagnostic performance of CEUS. RESULTS: Of 16 eligible studies, 957 breast lesions were included in the original meta-analysis, among which heterogeneity arising from factors other than threshold effect was explored. Meta-regression analysis confirmed the contrast agent was the most significant factor cause of heterogeneity (P = 0.0012, relative diagnostic odds ratio [DOR] = 7.06). The use of perfluoro containing microbubbles (Sonovue or Optison) significantly increased the diagnostic precision compared with Levovist. The pooled weighted estimates of sensitivity and specificity for CEUS in the diagnosis of breast lesions were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83, 0.89) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75, 0.83), respectively. CONCLUSION: CEUS has good sensitivity and specificity in the characterization of breast lesions and can potentially help to select suspicious breast mass for surgery.

AB  - Background: The Navigation Guide is a novel systematic review method to synthesize scientific evidence and reach strength of evidence conclusions for environmental health decision making. Objective: Our aim was to integrate scientific findings from human and nonhuman studies to determine the overall strength of evidence for the question “Does developmental exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) affect fetal growth in humans?” Methods: We developed and applied prespecified criteria to systematically and transparently a) rate the quality of the scientific evidence as “high,” “moderate,” or “low”; b) rate the strength of the human and nonhuman evidence separately as “sufficient,” “limited,” “moderate,” or “evidence of lack of toxicity”; and c) integrate the strength of the human and nonhuman evidence ratings into a strength of the evidence conclusion. Results: We identified 18 epidemiology studies and 21 animal toxicology studies relevant to our study question. We rated both the human and nonhuman mammalian evidence as “moderate” quality and “sufficient” strength. Integration of these evidence ratings produced a final strength of evidence rating in which review authors concluded that PFOA is “known to be toxic” to human reproduction and development based on sufficient evidence of decreased fetal growth in both human and nonhuman mammalian species. Conclusion: We concluded that developmental exposure to PFOA adversely affects human health based on sufficient evidence of decreased fetal growth in both human and nonhuman mammalian species. The results of this case study demonstrate the application of a systematic and transparent methodology, via the Navigation Guide, for reaching strength of evidence conclusions in environmental health.

AB  - The production of sewage sludge is increasing in China but with unsafe disposal practices, causing potential risk to human health and the environment. Using literature from the past 30 years (N = 159), we conducted a meta-analysis of organic contaminants (OCs) in Chinese sludge. Most data were available from developed and populated regions, and no data were found for Tibet. Since 1987, 35 classes of chemicals consisting of 749 individual compounds and 1 mixture have been analyzed, in which antibiotics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were the most targeted analytes. For 13 classes of principal OCs (defined as chemicals detected in over five studies) in sludge, the median (expressed in nanograms per gram dry weight) was the highest for phthalate esters (27 900), followed by alkylphenol polyethoxylates (12 000), synthetic musks (5800), antibiotics (4240), PAHs (3490), ultraviolet stabilizers (670), bisphenol analogs (160), organochlorine pesticides (110), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (100), pharmaceuticals (84), hormones (69), perfluorinated compounds (21), and polychlorinated biphenyls (15). Concentrations of PAHs in sludges collected between 1998 and 2012 showed a decreasing trend. Study findings suggest the need for a Chinese national sewage sludge survey to identify and regulate toxic OCs, ideally employing both targeted as well as nontargeted screening approaches.

TI  - [The role of liquid ventilation in the treatment of acute respiratory failure in children--a systematic review].
AU  - Góes PF
AU  - Troster EJ
AB  - BACKGROUND: Liquid Ventilation consists of partially or completely filling the lungs with a fluid (perfluorcarbon). This brings about elimination of the air-liquid interface and reduction of the surface tension in lungs with surfactant deficiency. This article focuses on the role of liquid ventilation in the treatment of acute respiratory failure in children. METHODS: A systematic review of literature was conducted using MEDLINE, LILACS and COCHRANE LIBRARY databases and references of articles. Match terms were: Liquid Ventilation, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Meconium Aspiration Syndrome, Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Randomized clinical trials, cohort studies and case control studies were searched for. Blood oxygenation, respiratory mechanics and survival were the outcomes evaluated. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty four publications related to liquid ventilation were selected during the study period: 19 (7.5%) were clinical trials and only six of them focused on the use of Liquid Ventilation in children. All six publications were characterized as phase I and II clinical trials and analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS: Upon analysis of these trials it was concluded that, because of the lack of controlled and randomized clinical trials, liquid ventilation cannot be recommended as a therapy for children with acute respiratory failure.

TI  - Serum perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and birthweight: an updated meta-analysis with bias analysis.
AU  - Steenland K
AU  - Barry V
AU  - Savitz D
AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent meta-analysis of 15 studies found a change in birthweight of -12.8 grams (95% CI -23.1, -2.38) per ng/ml PFOA in maternal or cord blood, and -27.1 grams (-50.6, -3.6) per log ng/ml PFOA (Negri E et al. Crit Rev Toxicol 2017;47:482-508). Almost all studies were done in low-exposed populations. There are nine new studies, adding 6019 births to the previous 6937 births. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of 24 studies. To combine all results, we approximated results for untransformed PFOA from nine studies using log-transformed PFOA. We also included another large study, excluded from previous analyses, in a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: We found a change of birthweight of -10.5 grams (-16.7, -4.4) for every ng/ml PFOA in maternal or cord blood. After adding one previously excluded large study, we found little evidence of an association (-1.0 grams, 95% CI -2.4, 0.4). Restricting to studies where blood was sampled from mothers early in the pregnancy or shortly before conception (5393 births), we found little association of PFOA with birthweight (-3.3 grams (-9.6, 3.0)). In studies where blood was sampled late in the pregnancy (7563 pregnancies), lower birthweight was associated with higher PFOA (-17.8 (-25.0, -10.6)). CONCLUSION: Present human evidence provides only modest support for decreased birthweight with increasing PFOA. Studies with a wide range of exposure, and studies with blood sampled early in pregnancy, showed little or no association of PFOA with birthweight. These are studies in which confounding and reverse causality would be of less concern.

TI  - Use of antioxidants in urinary tract infection.
AU  - Allameh Z
AU  - Salamzadeh J
AB  - Pyelonephritis is an inflammatory process, and oxidative stress plays a major role in it. Anti-inflammatory or antioxidant therapy given concomitantly with antibiotics should lower the risk of postpyelonephritic scarring. As the lack of review studies in the use of antioxidants in urinary tract infections was detected, this study was designed. We conducted a review of available articles in PubMed and Google Scholar with a simple review, using keywords of "antioxidant" and "pyelonephritis" with all their possible synonyms and combinations. Only interventional studies were collected. There were neither limitations on time, nor the location of the study, type of subjects, administration rout of the antioxidant drug, and the antioxidant drug used. After studying the abstracts or in some cases the full text of articles, they were categorized based on the type of antioxidant, type and number of subjects, rout of administration, dosing, duration of treatment, year of publication of the paper, and the results. A total of 66 articles published from 1991 to 2015 were found by studying just the title of the papers. Studying the abstracts reduced this number to 51 studies. Antioxidants used for this condition were Vitamins A, E, and C, cytoflavin, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, ebselen, allopurinol, melatonin, N-acetylcysteine, oleuropein, montelukast, oxytocin, ozon, dapsone, pentoxifyllin, tadalafil, bilirubin, cranberry, meloxicam, L-carnitine, colchicine, perfluoran, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone. Studies show that antioxidants are capable of reducing oxidative stress and can be used effectively along with antibiotics to reduce the scar formation.

AB  - Current evidence supports the notion that environmental exposures are associated with DNA-methylation and expression changes that can impact human health. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of epidemiologic studies evaluating the association between environmental chemicals with DNA methylation levels in adults. After excluding arsenic, recently evaluated in a systematic review, we identified a total of 17 articles (6 on cadmium, 4 on lead, 2 on mercury, 1 on nickel, 1 on antimony, 1 on tungsten, 5 on persistent organic pollutants and perfluorinated compounds, 1 on bisphenol A, and 3 on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). The selected articles reported quantitative methods to determine DNA methylation including immunocolorimetric assays for total content of genomic DNA methylation, and microarray technologies, methylation-specific quantitative PCR, Luminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA), and bisulfite pyrosequencing for DNA methylation content of genomic sites such as gene promoters, LINE-1, Alu elements, and others. Considering consistency, temporality, strength, dose-response relationship, and biological plausibility, we concluded that the current evidence is not sufficient to provide inference because differences across studies and limited samples sizes make it difficult to compare across studies and to evaluate sources of heterogeneity. Important questions for future research include the need for larger and longitudinal studies, the validation of findings, and the systematic evaluation of the dose-response relationships. Future studies should also consider the evaluation of epigenetic marks recently in the research spotlight such as DNA hydroxymethylation and the role of underlying genetic variants.

AB  - PURPOSE: To review the current literature on retinal displacement and provide a discussion of potential risk factors, postoperative outcomes, and future directions. METHODS: Two databases, MEDLINE and EMBASE, were mined using a directed search strategy to identify all articles on retinal displacement. RESULTS: We identified 1522 articles. A total of n = 14 articles were retained. We provide an overview on the potential influence of surgical type (n = 4), tamponade agents (n = 5), postoperative posture (n = 6), and preoperative retinal status (n = 5) on incidence of retinal displacement and visual outcomes (n = 8). Discussion. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with gas tamponade is associated with displacement rates of up to 72%, typically in a downward direction. Meanwhile, pneumatic retinopexy and PPV with silicone oil may offer similar surgical success with a significantly lower risk of displacement. The impact of heavy liquids such as perfluorocarbon liquid, postoperative positioning and preoperative extent of detachment on displacement remains inconclusive. Patients with displacement had a significantly lower visual acuity and higher rates of distortion than those without displacement. However, not all patients with displacement experienced visual symptoms. CONCLUSION: Retinal displacement is a new concept in our understanding of retinal detachment. Additional studies are needed to better define its impact on postsurgical outcomes.

AU  - Schwartz SG
AU  - Flynn HW
AU  - Wang X
AU  - Kuriyan AE
AU  - Abariga SA
AU  - Lee WH
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinal detachment (RD) with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) often requires surgery to restore normal anatomy and to stabilize or improve vision. PVR usually occurs in association with recurrent RD (that is, after initial retinal re-attachment surgery), but occasionally may be associated with primary RD. Either way, for both circumstances a tamponade agent (gas or silicone oil) is needed during surgery to reduce the rate of postoperative recurrent RD. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess the relative safety and effectiveness of various tamponade agents used with surgery for RD complicated by PVR. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to January 2019), Embase (January 1980 to January 2019), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2019), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 January 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on participants undergoing surgery for RD associated with PVR that compared various tamponade agents. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors screened the search results independently. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We identified four RCTs (601 participants) that provided data for the primary and secondary outcomes. Three RCTs provided data on visual acuity, two reported on macular attachment, one on retinal reattachment and another two on adverse events such as RD, worsening visual acuity and intraocular pressure. Study Characteristics Participants' characteristics varied across studies and across intervention groups, with an age range between 21 to 89 years, and were predominantly men. The Silicone Study was conducted in the USA and consisted of two RCTs: (silicone oil versus sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas tamponades; 151 participants) and (silicone oil versus perfluropropane (C3F8) gas tamponades; 271 participants). The third RCT compared heavy silicone oil (a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8) and silicone oil) with standard silicone oil (either 1000 centistokes or 5000 centistokes; 94 participants). The fourth RCT compared 1000 centistokes with 5000 centistokes silicone oil in 85 participants. We assessed most RCTs at low or unclear risk of bias for most 'Risk of bias' domains. Findings Although SF6 gas was reported to be associated with worse anatomic and visual outcomes than was silicone oil at one year (quantitative data not reported), at two years, silicone oil compared to SF6 gas showed no evidence of a difference in visual acuity (33% versus 51%; risk ratio (RR) 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 2.66; 1 RCT, 87 participants; low-certainty evidence). At one year, another RCT comparing silicone oil and C3F8 gas found no evidence of a difference in visual acuity between the two groups (41% versus 39%; RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.31; 1 RCT, 264 participants; low-certainty evidence). In a third RCT, participants treated with standard silicone oil compared to those receiving heavy silicone oil also showed no evidence of a difference in the change in visual acuity at one year, measured on logMAR scale ( mean difference -0.03 logMAR; 95% CI -0.35 to 0.29; 1 RCT; 93 participants; low-certainty evidence). The fourth RCT with 5000-centistoke and 1000-centistoke comparisons did not report data on visual acuity. For macular attachment, participants treated with silicone oil may probably experience more favorable outcomes than did participants who received SF6 at both one year (quantitative data not reported) and two years (58% versus 79%; RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.86; 1 RCT; 87 participants; low-certainty evidence). In another RCT, silicone oil compared to C3F8 at one year found no evidence of difference in macular attachment (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 1 RCT, 264 participants; low-certainty evidence). One RCT that compared 5000 centistokes to 1000 centistoke reported that retinal reattachment was successful in 67 participants (78.8%) with first surgery and 79 participants (92.9%) with the second surgery, and no evidence of between-group difference (1 RCT; 85 participants; low-certainty evidence). The fourth RCT that compared standard silicone oil with heavy silicone oil did not report on macular attachment. Adverse events In one RCT (86 participants), those receiving standard 1000 centistoke silicone oil compared with those of the 5000 centistoke silicone oil showed no evidence of a difference in intraocular pressure elevation at 18 months (24% versus 22%; RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.41 to 1.94; low-certainty evidence), visually significant cataract (49% versus 64%; RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.89; low-certainty evidence), and incidence of retina detachment after the removal of silicone oil (RR 0.36 95% CI 0.08 to 1.67; low-certainty evidence). Another RCT that compared standard silicone oil with heavy silicone oil suggests no difference in retinal detachment at one year (25% versus 22%; RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.48; 1 RCT; 186 participants; low-certainty evidence). Retinal detachment was not reported in the RCTs that compared silicone oil versus SF6 and silicone oil versus to C3F8. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There do not appear to be any major differences in outcomes between C3F8 and silicone oil. Silicone oil may be better than SF6 for macular attachment and other short-term outcomes. The choice of a tamponade agent should be individualized for each patient. The use of either C3F8 or standard silicone oil appears reasonable for most patients with RD associated with PVR. Heavy silicone oil, which is not available for routine clinical use in the USA, may not demonstrate evidence of superiority over standard silicone oil.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Contact dermatitis (CD) is a common occupational disease. There have been no systematic reviews of CD treatment or prevention. METHODS: Multiple databases were systematically searched. Using independent double review and published quality review criteria, articles were rated as good, fair, or poor. Treatment benefit data were tabulated and conclusions were based on the rated strength of published evidence. RESULTS: In all, 49 studies met inclusion criteria. Barrier creams containing dimethicone or perfluoropolyethers, cotton liners, and softened fabrics prevent irritant CD. Lipid-rich moisturizers both prevent and treat irritant CD. Topical skin protectant and quaternium 18 bentonite (organoclay) prevent rhus dermatitis. Diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (chelator) cream prevents nickel, chrome, and copper dermatitis. Potent or moderately potent steroids effectively treat allergic CD. There were no macrolide immunomodulator trials that met inclusion criteria. This review did not include studies of children, animals, or non-English language publications. CONCLUSIONS: A limited number of interventions effectively prevent or treat irritant and allergic CD, but well-controlled, outcome-blinded studies, particularly in the area of allergic CD prevention are needed.

AU  - Hitchcock DJ

AB  - Avian egg production demands resources as lipids and proteins. Relative egg size and mass varies across species, reflecting differences in maternal investment. This variability may affect the maternal transfer of anthropogenic pollutants including lipophilic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and protein-associated per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mercury (Hg). We conducted a meta-analysis on seabirds and investigated whether interspecies variation in maternal investment contributes towards skewed pollutant concentration ratios between males and females (80 studies). Overall concentrations of PCBs and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) were 1.6 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, in males than females, whereas mercury was similar between sexes. Few studies compared females and eggs (n = 6), highlighting a knowledge gap. We found that an increasing maternal investment as a clutch-to-female mass ratio resulted in lower PCB concentrations in females than in males during the incubation period, but no sex-specific differences were observed for mercury and PFOS. Egg production is both a lipid dominated and protein-limited process. Females transfer lipophilic pollutants more easily to eggs, and to a higher degree with increasing maternal investment, but feeding ecology may be more important. Interspecies variation in maternal pollutant transfer may lead to negative effects scaling from an offspring to population level.

AB  - Anti-androgenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can cross the placenta to modify early offspring sexual dimorphic markers. These changes are linked to Anogenital Distance (AGD), which is an androgen sensitive anthropometric parameter used as a biomarker of perineal growth and caudal migration of the genital tubercle. This review aimed to summarize strength of evidence for associations of in utero exposure to EDCs with AGD and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature so as to inform future research. We performed an electronic search of English literature through September 2019 in MEDLINE, Web of Science and Toxline. We included epidemiological studies that examined in utero exposure to persistent and non-persistent EDCs, and considered AGD in offspring as an outcome. Our review contained 16 investigations examining exposure to persistent EDCs (9 studies) and non-persistent EDCs (7 studies). Some individual studies reported an inverse association between exposure to BPA, dioxins, perfluoroalkyl substances and organochlorides, and AGD in both male and female offspring. Meta-analysis of 3 studies found a small reduction of AGD in female offspring exposed to BPA. The number of studies per chemical is small and number of subjects examined is limited; so, replication of these results is needed. To achieve more specificity and better replication of results, future studies should establish the association of non-persistent EDCs using multiple urine samples, evaluate the cumulative impact of exposure to a mixture of anti-androgenic chemicals, and offer adequate consideration of more maternal- and children-related confounding factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has taken an important role in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In the wake of current advances in nanotechnology, the drug delivery industry has seen a surge of nanoparticles advertising high specificity in target imaging. Given the rapid development of the field, this review has assembled related articles to explore whether molecular contrast agents can improve the diagnostic capability on gastrointestinal imaging, especially for IBD. METHODS: Relevant articles published between 1998 and 2018 from a literature search of PubMed and EMBASE were reviewed. Data extraction was performed on the studies' characteristics, experimental animals, modelling methods, nanoparticles type, magnetic resonance methods, and means of quantitative analysis. RESULTS: A total of 8 studies were identified wherein the subjects were animals, and all studies employed MR equipment. One group utilized a perfluorocarbon solution and the other 7 groups used either magnetic nanoparticles or gadolinium- (Gd-) related nanoparticles for molecular contrast. With ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles and Gd-related nanoparticles, signal enhancements were found in the mucosa or with focal lesion of IBD-related model in T1-weighted images (T1WI), whereas superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles showed a signal decrease in the intestinal wall of the model in T1WI or T2-weighted images. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was employed to analyze bowel intensity in 3 studies. And the percentage of normalized enhancement was used in 1 study for assessing the severity of inflammation. CONCLUSION: Molecular MRI with contrast agents can improve the early diagnosis of IBD and quantitate the severity of inflammation in experimental studies.

AB  - Toxicological and epidemiological evidence on the association between perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and birth/fetal weight was assessed. An extensive search for toxicological information in rats and mice, and a systematic search for epidemiological evidence were conducted. The linear regression coefficient (LRC) of birth weight (BrthW) on PFOA/PFOS was considered, and separate random effects meta-analyses for untransformed (i.e. not mathematically transformed) and log-transformed values were performed. Toxicological evidence: PFOA: 12 studies (21 datasets) in mice showed statistically significant lower birth/fetal weights from 5 mg/kg body weight per day. PFOS: most of the 13 studies (19 datasets) showed lower birth/fetal weights following in utero exposure. Epidemiological evidence: Sixteen articles were considered. The pooled LRC for a 1 ng/mL increase in untransformed PFOA (12 studies) in maternal plasma/serum was -12.8 g (95% CI -23.2; 2.4), and -27.1 g (95% CI -50.6; -3.6) for an increase of 1 loge ng/mL PFOA (nine studies). The pooled LRC for untransformed PFOS (eight studies) was -0.92 g (95%CI -3.4; 1.6), and for an increase of 1 loge ng/mL was -46.1(95% CI -80.3; -11.9). No consistent pattern emerged for study location or timing of blood sampling. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological and toxicological evidence suggests that PFOA and PFOS elicit a decrease in BrthW both in humans and rodents. However, the effective animal extrapolated serum concentrations are 10(2)-10(3) times higher than those in humans. Thus, there is no quantitative toxicological evidence to support the epidemiological association, thus reducing the biological plausibility of a causal relationship.

AB  - Endometriosis is a gynecological disorder characterized by the presence of endometrial stroma and glands outside the uterine cavity. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to clarify, starting from environmental exposure data, whether possible occupational risk factors may correlate with the onset of the disease. The guidelines for reporting systematic reviews of the "PRISMA" statement were followed and two databases, Scopus and PubMed, were used. Of the 422 studies selected with specific keywords, 32 publications were eligible, 28 of which referred to chemical agents and 4 related to night work. Conflicting data emerged among these studies. Although some compounds seemed to be more involved than others in the onset of endometriosis. Association with exposure to organochlorine compounds is the most supported by the epidemiological data, while other pesticide exposure did not show any clear correlation. Likewise, the hypothesis of a correlation with perfluoroalkyls exposure is not currently supported by data. The involvement of metals as risk factors has not been confirmed, while the role of night work, in the case of long service, seems to play an etiological role. In order to clarify the potential occupational risk of endometriosis development, well-designed studies are needed to evaluate the potential association between chemical compounds and disease etiology.

TI  - Exposure to modern, widespread environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals and their effect on the reproductive potential of women: an overview of current epidemiological evidence.
AU  - Karwacka A
AU  - Zamkowska D
AU  - Radwan M
AU  - Jurewicz J
AB  - Growing evidence indicates that exposure to widespread, environmental contaminants called endocrine disruptors (EDCs) negatively affects animal and human reproductive health and has been linked to several diseases including infertility. This review aims to evaluate the impact of environmental exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals [phthalates, parabens, triclosan, bisphenol A (BPA), organochlorine (PCBs) and perfluorinated (PFCs) compounds] on the reproductive potential among women, by reviewing most recently published literature. Epidemiological studies focusing on EDCs exposure and reproductive potential among women for the last 16 years were identified by a search of the PUBMED, MEDLINE, EBSCO and TOXNET literature databases. The results of the presented studies show that exposure to EDCs impacts the reproductive potential in women, measured by ovarian reserve and by assisted reproductive technology outcomes. Exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals decrease: (i) oestradiol levels (BPA); (ii) anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations (PCBs); (iii) antral follicle count (BPA, parabens, phthalates); (iv) oocyte quality (BPA, triclosan, phthalates, PCBs); (v) fertilization rate (PFCs, PCBs); (vi) implantation (BPA, phthalates, PCBs); (vii) embryo quality (triclosan, PCBs, BPA); (viii) rate of clinical pregnancy and live births (parabens, phthalates). The studies were mostly well-designed and used prospective cohorts with the exposure assessment based on the biomarker of exposure. Considering the suggested health effects, more epidemiological data is urgently needed to confirm the presented findings.

TI  - Association between environmental contaminants and health outcomes in indigenous populations of the Circumpolar North.
AU  - Singh K
AU  - Bjerregaard P
AU  - Man Chan H
AB  - Background Since the 1990s, research has been carried out to monitor environmental contaminants and their effects on human health in the Arctic. Although evidence shows that Arctic indigenous peoples are exposed to higher levels of contaminants and do worse on several dimensions of health compared with other populations, the contribution of such exposures on adverse outcomes is unclear. Objective The purpose of this review is to provide a synopsis of the published epidemiological literature that has examined association between environmental contaminants and health outcomes in Arctic indigenous populations. Design A literature search was conducted in OVID Medline (1946-January 2014) using search terms that combined concepts of contaminant and indigenous populations in the Arctic. No language or date restrictions were applied. The reference lists of review articles were hand-searched. Results Of 559 citations, 60 studies were relevant. The studies fell under the following categories: paediatric (n=18), reproductive health (n=18), obstetrics and gynaecology (n=9), cardiology (n=7), bone health (n=2), oncology (n=2), endocrinology (n=2) and other (n=2). All studies, except one from Arctic Finland, were either from Nunavik or Greenland. Most studies assessed polychlorinated biphenyls (n=43) and organochlorine pesticides (n=29). Fewer studies examined heavy metals, perfluorinated compounds, or polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Details of study results for each health category are provided. Conclusions It is difficult to make conclusive statements about the effects of environmental contaminants on health due to mixed results, small number of studies and studies being restricted to a small number of regions. Meta-analytical synthesis of the evidence should be considered for priority contaminants and health outcomes. The following research gaps should be addressed in future studies: association of contaminants and health in other Arctic regions (i.e. Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Nunavut, Nunatsiavut, Alaska, European North and Russian North); assessment of contaminants on chronic diseases; inclusion of clinical endpoints in assessments; and assessment of the emerging contaminants of perfluorinated compounds and polybrominated diphenyl ethers.

TI  - Nicotinamide and other benzamide analogs as agents for overcoming hypoxic cell radiation resistance in tumours. A review.
AU  - Horsman MR
AB  - Oxygen deficient hypoxic cells, which are resistant to sparsely ionising radiation, have now been identified in most animal and some human solid tumours and will influence the response of those tumours to radiation treatment. This hypoxia can be either chronic, arising from an oxygen diffusion limitation, or acute, resulting from transient stoppages in microregional blood flow. Although clinical attempts to overcome hypoxia have met with some success, the results have been far from satisfactory, and efforts are still being made to find better methods. Extensive experimental studies, especially in the last decade, have shown that nicotinamide and structurally related analogs can effectively sensitise murine tumours to both single and fractionated radiation treatments and that they do so in preference to the effects seen in mouse normal tissues. The earliest studies suggested that this enhancement of radiation damage was the result of an inhibition of the repair mechanisms, as was well documented in vitro. However, recent studies in mouse tumours have shown that the primary mode of action actually involves a reduction in tumour hypoxia. More specifically, these drugs prevent transient cessations in blood flow, thus inhibiting the development of acute hypoxia. This novel discovery led to the suggestion that the potential role of these agents as radiosensitizers would be when combined with treatments that overcame chronic hypoxia. The first attempt to demonstrate this combined nicotinamide with hyperthermia and found that the enhancement of radiation damage by both agents together was greater than that seen with each agent alone. Similar results were later seen for nicotinamide combined with a perfluorochemical emulsion, carbogen breathing, and pentoxifylline, and in all these studies the effects in tumours were always greater than those seen in appropriate normal tissues. Of all the analogs, it is nicotinamide itself which has been the most extensively studied as a radiosensitizer in vivo and the one that shows the greatest effect in animal tumours. It is also an agent that has been well established clinically for the treatment of a variety of disorders, with daily doses of up to 6 g being considered reasonably safe and associated with a low incidence of side effects. This human dose is equivalent to 100-200 mg/kg in mice and such doses will maximally sensitize murine tumours to radiation. These findings have now resulted in phase I/II clinical trials of nicotinamide, in combination with carbogen breathing, as a potential radiosensitizing treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endocrine disruptors are ubiquitous chemicals contaminants in the environment, wildlife, and humans. Their adverse effects on reproduction are well-documented. There is growing evidence that they can contribute to the current emergence of chronic diseases. OBJECTIVES: Our aim is to assess the relationships between endocrine disruptors and the neonatal health outcomes. METHODS: Two persons have independently reviewed Medline and Toxline databases about the following pollutants: bisphenol A, phthalates, parabens, brominated flame retardants and perfluorinated compounds. Only the human epidemiological studies, in general population with an abstract available, published between 2007 January the 1st and 2011 December the 31st, were analysed. The quality of each study was assessed with the Strobe score. RESULTS: Twenty-five out of 680 studies were included in the analysis. All pollutants were widely detected in maternal and new borns samples. Most of the studies have shown associations between bisphenol A, brominated flame retardants and perfluorinated compounds and lower birth weight. The effects on gestational age were less documented and have shown no clear connection. Results for phthalates were more ambiguous. Only one non-instructive study was found on parabens. DISCUSSION: Due to the inherent methological bias on endocrine disruptors research, further additional studies on environmental health must be investigated. It seems necessary to adopt preventive health measures first for vulnerable population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergic diseases are one of the most common and important diseases that can exert hazardous effects on children's health. The prevalence of allergic diseases in childhood is gradually increasing all over the world in recent decades. Known causes of these diseases include anomalous immune responses and allergic inflammatory reactions, but the causes of allergic diseases in childhood are complex. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Science were searched for articles focusing on environmental exposure during pregnancy and the risk of childhood allergic diseases, including asthma and atopic dermatitis, and the possible underlying mechanism. RESULTS: In terms of environmental factors, allergic diseases in childhood are closely related to environmental chemical exposure during pregnancy, including bisphenols, phthalates acid esters, perfluorochemicals, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and polychlorinated biphenyls. However, allergic diseases in childhood are also closely associated with maternal dietary nutrition, maternal intake of drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), paracetamol and antibiotics, and maternal lifestyle. CONCLUSIONS: Several harmful environmental factors during pregnancy can result in the interruption of the function of helper T cells (Th1/Th2), cytokines and immunoglobulins and may activate allergic reactions, which can lead to allergic diseases during childhood.

AB  - Although previous meta-analyses have shown that prenatal PFASs exposure is associated with reduction in birth weight, effects of prenatal PFASs exposure on birth outcomes have not been fully explored. We conducted a meta-analysis of 23 eligible studies searched from Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science before March 21, 2021 to analyze the association between prenatal PFASs exposure and birth outcomes, including premature birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age (SGA) and miscarriage. Odds ratio (OR) and corresponding confidence intervals were extracted for analysis. According to the heterogeneity of the included studies, fixed-effects (I2 ≤ 50%) and random-effects (I2 > 50%) models were applied respectively. The significant associations between PFOS and PTB (pooled OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.20-1.98), PFOA and miscarriage (pooled OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.15-1.70), and PFOS and LBW (pooled OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.19-1.94) were obtained. There were differences between included studies with different study regions, sampling time, and samples type used for PFASs assessment. These findings may provide insight in risk assessment and decision-making in producing products that contain PFASs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) are ubiquitous and may significantly contribute in environmental pollution, thus contaminating humans and wildlife. Environmental pollutants could interfere with bone homeostasis by means of different mechanisms, which include hormonal imbalance, direct osteoblasts toxicity and enanchment of osteoclasts activity, thus leading to osteopenia or osteoporosis. Among these, bisphenols, dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorobiphenyls, poly- and perfluoroalkyls, phthalates, parabens, organotins and cadmium may play a role in bone distuption. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI-web of knowledge and Google scholar databases were searched for medical subject headings terms and free-text word related to the aforementioned classes of chemicals and bone metabolism and remodelling for better clarifying and understanding the main mechanisms of bone disruption. RESULTS: Several of EDCs act as xenoestrogens. Considering that estrogens play a significant role in regulating bone remodeling, most of these chemicals generate hormonal imbalance with possible detrimental consequences on bone tissue structure and its mechanical and non-mechanical properties. DISCUSSION: A lot of evidences about bone distruptors came from in vitro studies or animal models, and conduct to equivocal results. In addition, a few data derived form humans and most of these data focused on the impact of EDCs on bone mineral density without considering their influence on long-term fracture risk. Moreover, it should be taken into account that humans are exposed to a mixture of EDCs and the final effect on bone metabolism might be the result of either a synergism or antagonist effects among them. Age of first exposure, cumulative dose exposure over time, and the usually observed non-monotonic dose-response curve for EDCs should be considered as other important variable influencing the final effect on bone metabolism. CONCLUSION: Taking into account these variables, observational studies are needed to better analyze this issue both for echological purpose and to preserve bone health.

AB  - Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) has been marketed as a substitute for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) to reduce environmental and health risks. GenX and PFOA have been detected in various natural water sources, and adsorption is recognized as a typical treatment process for PFOA removal. In this paper, comparisons of GenX and PFOA adsorption are evaluated, including adsorption potential, adsorption mechanisms, and associated costs. A detailed literature review suggests that anion-exchange resins are more effective in removing GenX than activated carbon. GenX removal efficiency through activated carbon (30%) is lower than that of PFOA (80-95%), while GenX and PFOA removal efficiencies by anion exchange resins are similar (99%). Unconventional adsorbents, such as ionic fluorogels and covalent organic frameworks can effectively remove GenX from water. The review reveals that GenX adsorption is more challenging, requiring almost 4 times the treatment cost of its predecessor, PFOA. Annual operation and maintenance costs for GenX adsorption (initial concentration of GenX and PFOA = 0.2 µg.L-1) by GAC for treating 10,000 m3 per day is almost US$1,000,000 per year, but only around US$240,000 per year for PFOA. Desorption of GenX in the presence of PFOA highlights GenX's inferior treatability by adsorption. It is believed that GenX is a more environmentally friendly compound than PFOA, but this environmental friendliness comes with the price.

AB  - Background: The Navigation Guide methodology was developed to meet the need for a robust method of systematic and transparent research synthesis in environmental health science. We conducted a case study systematic review to support proof of concept of the method. Objective: We applied the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology to determine whether developmental exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) affects fetal growth in humans. Methods: We applied the first 3 steps of the Navigation Guide methodology to human epidemiological data: 1) specify the study question, 2) select the evidence, and 3) rate the quality and strength of the evidence. We developed a protocol, conducted a comprehensive search of the literature, and identified relevant studies using prespecified criteria. We evaluated each study for risk of bias and conducted meta-analyses on a subset of studies. We rated quality and strength of the entire body of human evidence. Results: We identified 18 human studies that met our inclusion criteria, and 9 of these were combined through meta-analysis. Through meta-analysis, we estimated that a 1‑ng/mL increase in serum or plasma PFOA was associated with a –18.9 g (95% CI: –29.8, –7.9) difference in birth weight. We concluded that the risk of bias across studies was low, and we assigned a “moderate” quality rating to the overall body of human evidence. Conclusion: On the basis of this first application of the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology, we concluded that there is “sufficient” human evidence that developmental exposure to PFOA reduces fetal growth.

AB  - There are conflicting reports about the effectiveness of perfluorocarbons used in the two-layer method (TLM) of pancreas preservation for human islet transplantation. The mechanism of action is unclear and the optimal role of this method uncertain. The study design was a meta-analysis of the evidence that TLM improves islet isolation outcomes. Pubmed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, and BIOSIS were searched electronically in January 2008. After selecting the relevant human trials for meta-analysis data relating to donor variables, study design, primary and secondary islet isolation outcomes were extracted. Electronic searches identified eight unique citations, describing 11 human studies that were eligible for the meta-analysis. When comparing TLM with preservation in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution, there was a statistically significant higher islet yield [WMD 711.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 140.03-1283.07] in the TLM group. The proportion of transplantable preparations obtained was not significantly different (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.89-1.88) between the two groups. The rate of successful islet isolations for marginal organs was higher in the TLM group (OR 6.69, 95% CI 1.80-24.87). Improved oxygenation and preservation of cellular bioengertics is thought to be the main underlying mechanism, although no single mechanism has yet been confirmed. There is currently no clear evidence that the TLM is beneficial in human islet transplantation. It may improve the preservation of marginal organs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that prenatal or early-life exposures to environmental contaminants may contribute to an increased risk of asthma and allergies in children. We aimed to the explore associations of prenatal exposures to a large set of environmental chemical contaminants with asthma and eczema in school-age children. METHODS: We studied 1024 mother-child pairs from Greenland and Ukraine from the INUENDO birth cohort. Data were collected by means of an interview-based questionnaire when the children were 5-9 years of age. Questions from the ISAAC study were used to define asthma, eczema, and wheeze. We applied principal components analysis (PCA) to sixteen contaminants in maternal serum sampled during pregnancy, including perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), metabolites of diethylhexyl (DEHP) and diisononyl (DiNP) phthalates, PCB-153, and p,p'-DDE. Scores of five principal components (PCs) explaining 70% of the variance were included in multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: In a meta-analysis that included both populations, the PC2 score, reflecting exposure to DiNP, was negatively associated with current eczema (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96). Other associations were not consistent between the two populations. In Ukrainian children, the PC3 score (DEHP) was positively associated with current wheeze (adjusted OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.03-2.37), whereas the PC5 score, dominated by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), was inversely associated with current wheeze (OR 0.64, 0.41-0.99). In Greenlandic children, a negative association of PC4 (organochlorines) with ever eczema (OR 0.78, 0.61-0.99) was found. CONCLUSIONS: We found limited evidence to support a link between prenatal exposure to environmental chemical contaminants and childhood asthma and eczema.

Heavier-than-water intraocular tamponades have been developed to improve inferior tamponading properties, and their chemical compositions have been substantially improved over the years, in parallel with developments in vitrectomy instrumentation and surgical techniques. Herein we present an updated review of the clinical use of standard formulations and HSO, focusing on analysis of the intraocular inflammation associated with endotamponade agents, and comparison of the adverse effects of these agents on the physical and biological properties of the eye. METHODS: A detailed literature search was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar using the key words. Fifty-eight articles matched our inclusion criteria that were included in this systematic review. RESULTS: Perfluorocarbon liquids and partially fluorinated alkanes are associated with tamponade emulsification, intraocular inflammation, and rises in intraocular pressure, but these associations are not as strong when these substances are mixed with a heavy silicone oil (HSO). Two recently approved heavy silicone oil tamponades, Oxane HD and Densiron 68, are now available for use in clinical practice. While the complication spectrum of the new generation of these HSOs seems to be similar to that of conventional silicone oil tamponades, they provide better support for the inferior retina and the posterior pole. CONCLUSION: Both regular and heavy silicone oils usually yield good success rates in cases of complicated retinal detachment. Decisions as to whether to utilize heavy or regular silicone oil should be made on a case-by-case basis.

TI  - Association between environmental contaminants and health outcomes in indigenous populations of the Circumpolar North.
AU  - Singh K
AU  - Bjerregaard P
AU  - Chan HM
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the 1990s, research has been carried out to monitor environmental contaminants and their effects on human health in the Arctic. Although evidence shows that Arctic indigenous peoples are exposed to higher levels of contaminants and do worse on several dimensions of health compared with other populations, the contribution of such exposures on adverse outcomes is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to provide a synopsis of the published epidemiological literature that has examined association between environmental contaminants and health outcomes in Arctic indigenous populations. DESIGN: A literature search was conducted in OVID Medline (1946-January 2014) using search terms that combined concepts of contaminant and indigenous populations in the Arctic. No language or date restrictions were applied. The reference lists of review articles were hand-searched. RESULTS: Of 559 citations, 60 studies were relevant. The studies fell under the following categories: paediatric (n=18), reproductive health (n=18), obstetrics and gynaecology (n=9), cardiology (n=7), bone health (n=2), oncology (n=2), endocrinology (n=2) and other (n=2). All studies, except one from Arctic Finland, were either from Nunavik or Greenland. Most studies assessed polychlorinated biphenyls (n=43) and organochlorine pesticides (n=29). Fewer studies examined heavy metals, perfluorinated compounds, or polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Details of study results for each health category are provided. CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to make conclusive statements about the effects of environmental contaminants on health due to mixed results, small number of studies and studies being restricted to a small number of regions. Meta-analytical synthesis of the evidence should be considered for priority contaminants and health outcomes. The following research gaps should be addressed in future studies: association of contaminants and health in other Arctic regions (i.e. Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Nunavut, Nunatsiavut, Alaska, European North and Russian North); assessment of contaminants on chronic diseases; inclusion of clinical endpoints in assessments; and assessment of the emerging contaminants of perfluorinated compounds and polybrominated diphenyl ethers.

TI  - The impact of PFOS on health in the general population: a review.
AU  - Saikat S

AU  - Kamanyire R
AB  - Perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) is a persistent organic pollutant that is toxic, bioaccumulative and undergoes wide transportation across all environmental media. It has been widely detected in environmental samples but there is limited information about the health effects on humans from environmental exposure. This paper presents the findings of a review of the literature on the impact of PFOS on the health of the general population. Fifteen relevant epidemiological studies were identified that looked at the association between human PFOS exposure and a range of health related outcomes. Small but statistically significant associations have been reported with PFOS and total cholesterol, glucose metabolism, body mass index (BMI), thyroid function, infertility, breast feeding, uric acid and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The true significance of these findings is uncertain due to the inconsistencies in some of the study results and the limitations of the literature. The majority of studies were cross-sectional and considered surrogate markers of health (e.g. cholesterol levels). The available literature is also limited in ascertaining the link between PFOS concentrations in the environment, exposure pathways and health effects. We conclude that the current evidence is inconclusive and further large-scale prospective cohort studies would be useful to assess the association between environmental exposure to PFOS, appropriate biomarkers (e.g. serum levels of PFOS) and health outcomes.

TI  - Environmental chemicals and breast cancer: An updated review of epidemiological literature informed by biological mechanisms.
AU  - Rodgers KM
AU  - Udesky JO
AU  - Rudel RA
AU  - Brody JG
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many common environmental chemicals are mammary gland carcinogens in animal studies, activate relevant hormonal pathways, or enhance mammary gland susceptibility to carcinogenesis. Breast cancer's long latency and multifactorial etiology make evaluation of these chemicals in humans challenging. OBJECTIVE: For chemicals previously identified as mammary gland toxicants, we evaluated epidemiologic studies published since our 2007 review. We assessed whether study designs captured relevant exposures and disease features suggested by toxicological and biological evidence of genotoxicity, endocrine disruption, tumor promotion, or disruption of mammary gland development. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed database for articles with breast cancer outcomes published in 2006-2016 using terms for 134 environmental chemicals, sources, or biomarkers of exposure. We critically reviewed the articles. RESULTS: We identified 158 articles. Consistent with experimental evidence, a few key studies suggested higher risk for exposures during breast development to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dioxins, perfluorooctane-sulfonamide (PFOSA), and air pollution (risk estimates ranged from 2.14 to 5.0), and for occupational exposure to solvents and other mammary carcinogens, such as gasoline components (risk estimates ranged from 1.42 to 3.31). Notably, one 50-year cohort study captured exposure to DDT during several critical windows for breast development (in utero, adolescence, pregnancy) and when this chemical was still in use. Most other studies did not assess exposure during a biologically relevant window or specify the timing of exposure. Few studies considered genetic variation, but the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project reported higher breast cancer risk for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in women with certain genetic variations, especially in DNA repair genes. CONCLUSIONS: New studies that targeted toxicologically relevant chemicals and captured biological hypotheses about genetic variants or windows of breast susceptibility added to evidence of links between environmental chemicals and breast cancer. However, many biologically relevant chemicals, including current-use consumer product chemicals, have not been adequately studied in humans. Studies are challenged to reconstruct exposures that occurred decades before diagnosis or access biological samples stored that long. Other problems include measuring rapidly metabolized chemicals and evaluating exposure to mixtures.

AB  - Quercetin is one of the most abundant flavonoids in human diet that has been reported to exhibit a wide range of pharmacological properties. The biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in the hepatoprotective activity of quercetin were discussed in this review. Quercetin exhibited hepatoprotective activity against 2-butoxyethanol, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, aflatoxin B1, aroclor-1254, arsenic, sodium arsenite, azathioprine, cadmium chloride, carbon tetrachloride, chlorpyrifos, cyclosporine A, diazinon, dimethylnitrosamine, doxorubicin, epirubicin, ethanol, fenvalerate, isoniazide, rifampicin, lead acetate, lindane, D-galactosamine, methotrexate, methylmercury, nickel sulfate, paracetamol, perfluorooctanoic acid, polychlorinated biphenyls, pyrrolizidine alkaloid clivorine, rotenone, sodium fluoride, streptazotocin, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, thioacetamide, titanium dioxide, tumor necrosis factor-α, tripterygium glycoside, triptolide, ultraviolet A light, concavalin A, bisphenol, and ischemia-induced hepatotoxicity in various animal models due to its antioxidant, free radical-scavenging,anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) inhibitory activities. In this review, we provide an overview of the possible mechanisms by which quercetin reduced the hepatotoxicity of different hepatotoxicants. This will help the toxicologists, pharmacologists, and chemists to develop new safer pharmaceutical products with quercetin and other hepatotoxicants.

TI  - Persistent Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals and Fatty Liver Disease.
AU  - Deierlein AL
AU  - Rock S
AU  - Park S
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prominent chronic liver disease in Western countries, affecting approximately 25% of the population worldwide. Sex-specific differences in the development of NAFLD are apparent. While obesity and insulin resistance are major contributors to the increasing prevalence of NAFLD, a growing body of literature suggests that exposure to persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals (pEDCs) may also play a role. This review summarizes recent (2011 and later) scientific literature investigating exposures to pEDCs, specifically persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and NAFLD, with a focus on sex-specific associations. RECENT FINDINGS: The overwhelming majority of studies were conducted in single-sex animal models and provide biological evidence that exposures to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin polychlorinated biphenyls, and other POPs or POP mixtures are negatively associated with liver health. There were four cross-sectional epidemiological studies in humans that reported associations for several POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls and perfluorinated chemicals, with elevated liver enzymes. Only one of these studies, using a sample of gastric bypass surgery patients, examined sex-specific associations of POPs and liver enzymes, finding adverse associations among women only. The noticeable lack of studies investigating how differences (i.e., biochemical, physiological, and behavioral) between men and women may influence associations of pEDCs and NAFLD represents a large research gap in environmental health. Sexual dimorphism in metabolic processes throughout the body, including the liver, is established but often overlooked in the designs and analyses of studies. Other factors identified in this review that may also act to modulate associations of environmental chemicals and NAFLD are reproductive status and dietary nutrient intakes, which also remain understudied in the literature. Despite knowledge of sexual dimorphism in the actions of pEDCs, as well as in metabolic processes related to NAFLD development, few experimental or epidemiological studies have investigated sex-dependent associations. Future studies, especially those in humans, should be designed to address this research need. Consideration of other factors, such as reproductive status, dietary intakes, and mixtures of chemicals with varying endocrine-disrupting capabilities, should be explored.

TI  - Life-Time Environmental Chemical Exposure and Obesity: Review of Epidemiological Studies Using Human Biomonitoring Methods.
AU  - Mohanto NC

AB  - The exponential global increase in the incidence of obesity may be partly attributable to environmental chemical (EC) exposure. Humans are constantly exposed to ECs, primarily through environmental components. This review compiled human epidemiological study findings of associations between blood and/or urinary exposure levels of ECs and anthropometric overweight and obesity indices. The findings reveal research gaps that should be addressed. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed) for full text English articles published in 2006-2020 using the keywords "environmental exposure" and "obesity". A total of 821 articles were retrieved; 102 reported relationships between environmental exposure and obesity indices. ECs were the predominantly studied environmental exposure compounds. The ECs were grouped into phenols, phthalates, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to evaluate obesogenic roles. In total, 106 articles meeting the inclusion criteria were summarized after an additional search by each group of EC combined with obesity in the PubMed and Scopus databases. Dose-dependent positive associations between bisphenol A (BPA) and various obesity indices were revealed. Both individual and summed di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and non-DEHP metabolites showed inconsistent associations with overweight and obesity indices, although mono-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), and mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) seem to have obesogenic roles in adolescents, adults, and the elderly. Maternal exposure levels of individual POP metabolites or congeners showed inconsistent associations, whereas dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were positively associated with obesity indices. There was insufficient evidence of associations between early childhood EC exposure and the subsequent development of overweight and obesity in late childhood. Overall, human evidence explicitly reveals the consistent obesogenic roles of BPA, DDE, and PFOA, but inconsistent roles of phthalate metabolites and other POPs. Further prospective studies may yield deeper insights into the overall scenario.

TI  - Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6) versus Perfluoropropane (C3F8) in the Intraoperative Management of Macular Holes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
AU  - Hecht, Idan

AU  - Blumenthal, Eytan Z.
AU  - Barak, Yoreh
AB  - Purpose. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify and review studies comparing SF6 to C3F8 as a tamponade agent in the intraoperative management of macular holes. Methods. Publications up to October 2018 that focused on macular hole surgery in terms of primary closure, complications, and clinical outcomes were included. Forest plots were created using a weighted summary of proportion meta-analysis. Analysis was performed separately for SF6 and C3F8. A random effects model was used, and corresponding I2 heterogeneity estimates were calculated. Results. Nine pertinent publications studying a total of 4,715 patients were identified in 2000 to 2017, including two randomized studies (n=206), two prospective studies (n=170), and five retrospective or registry-based studies. Similar rates of closure between SF6 and C3F8 were reported in eight out of nine studies, regardless of subgroup analyses. All studies reporting visual outcomes showed similar results when comparing SF6 to C3F8 at one to six months of follow-up. Neither agent was clearly associated with increased risk of ocular hypertension, cataract formation, or other adverse events. Meta-analytic pooling of the closure rates in the SF6 group resulted in 91.73% (95% confidence interval: 88.40 to 94.55, I2: 38.03%), and for C3F8, the closure rate was 88.36% (95% confidence interval: 85.88 to 90.63, I2: 0.0%). Conclusions. Both SF6 and C3F8 appear to have achieved similar visual outcomes and primary closure rates and neither was associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Considering the more rapid visual recovery with SF6, there appears to be no evidence to support C3F8 as the tamponade agent of choice for macular hole surgery.

TI  - Critical Review on PFOA, Kidney Cancer, and Testicular Cancer.
AU  - Bartell SM
AU  - Vieira VM
AB  - The carcinogenicity of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been reviewed previously by several different regulatory agencies and researchers, with contradictory conclusions-especially regarding epidemiological findings on kidney cancer and testicular cancer. In addition, previous dose-response assessments have focused primarily on evidence from animal studies. This critical review summarizes peer reviewed epidemiological studies on PFOA and cancers of the kidneys and testes, using modified Hill's criteria to assess the evidence for causation. We converted exposures to a common scale based on serum PFOA concentrations and applied meta-analysis to estimate the average increase in cancer risk reported by the studies with sufficient information to estimate serum PFOA. Using random effects meta-analysis, we found that the average relative increase in cancer risk per 10 ng/mL increase in serum PFOA for these studies is 16% (95% CI: 3%, 30%) for kidney cancer and 3% (95% CI: 2%, 4%) for testicular cancer. These associations are most likely causal, but results are limited by the small number of studies for testicular cancer, the overlapping study populations for several studies, and the lack of measured or modelled serum PFOA concentrations for several studies.
