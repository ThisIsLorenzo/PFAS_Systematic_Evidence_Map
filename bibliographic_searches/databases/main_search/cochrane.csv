The optimal method of intervention remains unknown. Objectives To compare surgery, metal endoscopic stents and plastic endoscopic stents in the relief of distal biliary obstruction in patients with inoperable pancreatic carcinoma. Search methods We searched the databases of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Group specialised register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CancerLit, Current Concepts Database and BIDS (September 2002 to September 2004). The searches were re‐run in December 2005 and November 2008. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing surgery to endoscopic stenting, endoscopic metal stents to plastic stents, and different types of endoscopic plastic and metal stents, used to relieve obstruction of the distal bile duct in patients with inoperable pancreatic carcinoma. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials. Main results Twenty‐nine trials, that enrolled over 1,700 participants with pancreatic carcinoma, were included. Three eligible studies compared plastic stents to surgery. Endoscopic stenting with plastic stents was associated with a reduced risk of complications (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 ‐ 0.81), but with higher risk of recurrent biliary obstruction prior to death (RR 18.59, 95% CI 5.33 ‐ 64.86) when compared with surgery. There was a trend towards lower risk of 30‐day mortality with plastic stents (p=0.07, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32, 1.04). One published study compared metal stents to surgery and reported lower costs and better quality‐of‐life with metal stents.     Nine studies compared metal to plastic stents. Metal stents were associated with a lower risk of recurrent biliary obstruction than plastic stents (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.38 ‐ 0.62). There was no significant difference in risk of technical failure, therapeutic failure, complications or 30‐day mortality by meta‐analysis.     When different types of plastic stents were compared to polyethylene stents, only perflouro alkoxy plastic stents had superior outcomes in one trial. The addition of an anti‐reflux valve improved the patency of Teflon stents. Authors' conclusions Endoscopic metal stents are the intervention of choice at present in patients with malignant distal obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic carcinoma. In patients with short predicted survival, their patency benefits over plastic stents may not be realised. Further RCTs are needed to determine the optimal stent type for these patients. Plain language summary Palliative biliary stents for obstructing pancreatic cancer The majority of patients with cancer of the pancreas are diagnosed only after blockage of the bile ducts has occurred. Surgical by‐pass (SBP) or endoscopic stenting (ES) of the blockage are the treatment options available for these patients. This review compares 29 randomised controlled trials that used surgical by‐pass, endoscopic metal stents or endoscopic plastic stents in patients with malignant bile duct obstruction. All included studies contained groups where cancer of the pancreas was the most common cause of bile duct obstruction. This review shows that endoscopic stents are preferable to surgery in palliation of malignant distal bile duct obstruction due to pancreatic cancer. The choice of metal or plastic stents depends on the expected survival of the patient; metal stents only differ from plastic stents in the risk of recurrent bile duct obstruction. Polyethylene stents and stainless‐steel alloy stents (Wallstent) are the most studied stents.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Stents; Cholestasis [etiology, *surgery]; Humans; Jaundice, Obstructive [etiology, *surgery]; Pancreatic Neoplasms [*complications]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD004200.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004200.pub4","Gut"
"CD003863.PUB2","Ada, L; Foongchomcheay, A; Canning, CG","Supportive devices for preventing and treating subluxation of the shoulder after stroke","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2005","Abstract - Background Supportive devices such as slings, wheelchair attachments and orthoses have been used to treat subluxation of the shoulder after stroke. Objectives To investigate the effect of supportive devices in preventing subluxation, re‐positioning the head of humerus in the glenoid fossa, decreasing pain, increasing function and adversely increasing contracture in the shoulder after stroke. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched on 22 March 2004). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library , Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2004), CINAHL (1982 to March 2004), EMBASE (1974 to March 2004), AMED (1985 to March 2004) and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro, March 2004). We also handsearched conference proceedings and contacted authors for additional information. Selection criteria Studies were included if they were: randomised, quasi‐randomised or controlled trials; participants had a stroke; intervention was supportive devices; and subluxation, pain, function or contracture were measured. Data collection and analysis Two independent reviewers examined the identified studies which were assessed for methodological quality and analysed as (1) supportive devices versus no supportive devices or (2) two supportive devices. Main results Four trials (one on slings, three on strapping ‐ 142 participants) met the inclusion criteria. One trial testing a hemisling versus no device reported that no participants had subluxation greater than 10 mm, the same number had lost more than 30 degrees of shoulder external rotation (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1 to 9.3), and more participants in the hemisling group had pain (Peto OR 8.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 67.1). The other three showed that strapping was effective in delaying the onset of pain (weighted mean difference (WMD) 14 days, 95% CI 9.7 to 17.8), but was ineffective in reducing pain severity (WMD ‐0.7 cm on a visual analogue scale, 95% CI ‐2.0 to 0.7), increasing upper limb function (WMD 0.8, 95% CI ‐1.5 to 3.1) or affecting the degree of contracture (WMD ‐1.4 degrees, 95% CI ‐10.9 to 8.1) at the shoulder. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether slings and wheelchair attachments prevent subluxation, decrease pain, increase function or adversely increase contracture in the shoulder after stroke. There is some evidence that strapping the shoulder delays the onset of pain but does not decrease it, nor does it increase function or adversely increase contracture. Plain language summary Supportive devices for preventing and treating subluxation of the shoulder after stroke There is insufficient evidence to conclude that supportive devices are effective in the prevention and treatment of subluxation of the shoulder after stroke. Shoulder subluxation is one of the most common secondary musculoskeletal problems after stroke which can cause pain and hinder the recovery of upper limb function. Supportive devices have traditionally been applied to treat shoulder subluxation. This review of four trials found insufficient evidence to conclude whether supportive devices prevent subluxation or not and found no evidence to conclude whether supportive devices can reposition the head of humerus in the glenoid fossa of an already subluxed shoulder.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Orthotic Devices; Braces; Contracture [etiology, prevention & control]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Shoulder Dislocation [*prevention & control]; Shoulder Pain [prevention & control]; Stroke [*complications]; Wheelchairs","10.1002/14651858.CD003863.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003863.pub2","Stroke"
"CD007312.PUB2","Zakrzewska, JM; Akram, H","Neurosurgical interventions for the treatment of classical trigeminal neuralgia","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2011","Abstract - Background Surgical interventions are used for trigeminal neuralgia when drug treatment fails. Surgical treatments divide into two main categories, ablative (destructive) or non‐ablative. These treatments can be done at three different sites: peripherally, at the Gasserian ganglion level, and within the posterior fossa of the skull. Objectives To assess the efficacy of neurosurgical interventions for classical trigeminal neuralgia in terms of pain relief, quality of life and any harms. To determine if there are defined subgroups of patients more likely to benefit. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, (13 May 2010), CENTRAL (Issue 2, 2010 part of the Cochrane Library), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHSEED) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (Issue 4, 2010 (HTA, NHSEED and DARE are part of the Cochrane Library)), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2010) and EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2010) with no language exclusion. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of neurosurgical interventions used in the treatment of classical trigeminal neuralgia. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted authors for clarification and missing information whenever possible. Main results Eleven studies involving 496 participants met some of the inclusion criteria stated in the protocol. One hundred and eighty patients in five studies had peripheral interventions, 229 patients in five studies had percutaneous interventions applied to the Gasserian ganglion, and 87 patients in one study underwent two modalities of stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife) treatment. No studies addressing microvascular decompression (which is the only non‐ablative procedure) met the inclusion criteria. All but two of the identified studies had a high to medium risk of bias because of either missing data or methodological inconsistency. It was not possible to undertake meta‐analysis because of differences in the intervention modalities and variable outcome measures. Three studies had sufficient outcome data for analysis. One trial, which involved 40 participants, compared two techniques of radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RFT) of the Gasserian ganglion at six months. Pulsed RFT resulted in return of pain in all participants by three months. When this group were converted to conventional (continuous) treatment these participants achieved pain control comparable to the group that had received conventional treatment from the outset. Sensory changes were common in the continuous treatment group. In another trial, of 87 participants, investigators compared radiation treatment to the trigeminal nerve at one or two isocentres in the posterior fossa. There were insufficient data to determine if one technique was superior to another. Two isocentres increased the incidence of sensory loss. Increased age and prior surgery were predictors for poorer pain relief. Relapses were nonsignificantly reduced with two isocentres (risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence intervaI (CI) 0.30 to 1.71). A third study compared two techniques for RFT in 54 participants for 10 to 54 months. Both techniques produced pain relief (not significantly in favour of neuronavigation (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.04) but relief was more sustained and side effects fewer if a neuronavigation system was used. The remaining eight studies did not report outcomes as predetermined in our protocol. Authors' conclusions There is very low quality evidence for the efficacy of most neurosurgical procedures for trigeminal neuralgia because of the poor quality of the trials. All procedures produced variable pain relief, but many resulted in sensory side effects. There were no studies of microvascular decompression which observational data suggests gives the longest pain relief. There is little evidence to help comparative decision making about the best surgical procedure. Well designed studies are urgently needed. Plain language summary Neurosurgical interventions for the treatment of classical trigeminal neuralgia Trigeminal neuralgia is defined as ""sudden usually unilateral severe brief stabbing recurrent pains in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve"". It has an incidence rate of 12.6 per 100,000 person years and more commonly affects older age groups. The fifth cranial nerve is one of the largest in the head. The nerve is called trigeminal because it splits into three main branches. It provides sensation to the face. When neuralgia (nerve pain) occurs in the trigeminal nerve it causes severe and sudden face pain. The causes of trigeminal neuralgia are unclear. Treatment of all people with classical trigeminal neuralgia begins with drug therapy, most frequently using one of several drugs also used to treat epilepsy, among which the gold standard remains carbamazepine. If drug therapy fails then surgical interventions may be used. Surgical treatments divide into two main categories: ablative (destroying the nerve) or non‐ablative (preserving nerve function and relieving the pressure on the nerve). These procedures result in pain relief for variable lengths of time. For this review, we searched for all of the surgical procedures for trigeminal neuralgia. We found 11 studies, which included 496 patients, but only three had sufficient outcome data to report. These three studies, which involved a total of 181 participants, fulfilled the inclusion criteria and form the basis of this review. The primary aim of all three studies was to determine if one technique was better than the other. All three included studies evaluated destructive techniques. None of the three studies evaluated the non‐destructive procedure of microvascular decompression and this is a major drawback in the literature. One study compared two different techniques of radiofrequency thermocoagulation, in 40 participants six months after the procedure. This technique involves heating the nerve by passing an electrical current through the tip of a special needle which has been introduced through the skin into a hole in the base of the skull and into the ganglion from which the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve branch out (Gasserian ganglion). If the radiofrequency was given as pulsed treatment (which causes the tip of the needle to heat up intermittently and not continuously) the original pain in all participants returned by three months. The continuous radiofrequency treatment then had to be applied, and these participants then achieved pain control comparable to those who had received continuous radiofrequency throughout. Changes in sensation ranging from mild to severe numbness were common in the conventional (continuous) radiofrequency treatment group. A second trial, in 87 participants, looked at using one or two isocentres (specific points in the nerve) to deliver radiation to the trigeminal nerve just as it leaves the brainstem inside the skull. Use of medication afterwards was considered a surrogate measure for pain. Use of two isocentres increased the occurrence of sensory loss as a complication. Increased age and prior surgery were predictors for poorer pain relief. There were insufficient data given to judge the effectiveness of one procedure better than the other. A third study compared two techniques for performing radiofrequency thermocoagulation of the Gasserian ganglion in 54 participants. The study compared two ways of introducing the needle and guiding it, using either X‐rays or a special neuronavigation system. Pain relief was measured by a questionnaire at three months. Both techniques provided pain relief (which did not differ significantly between the two arms) but it was more sustained if a neuronavigation system was used and this system also decreased side effects. All the reviewed procedures resulted in pain relief and some participants were then able to stop taking medications. However, many procedures tended to result in sensory side effects. All the studies in this review had flaws in their methods and all but two showed considerable risk of bias. There is little evidence from these trials to guide the person with trigeminal neuralgia as to the most effective surgical procedure. There is now an urgent need to evaluate the surgical interventions used in trigeminal neuralgia and to design robust studies; either randomised controlled trials or long‐term prospective independently assessed cohort studies.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Stereotaxic Techniques; Electrocoagulation [*methods]; Humans; Nerve Block [*methods]; Neuronavigation [methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Trigeminal Ganglion [*surgery]; Trigeminal Neuralgia [surgery, *therapy]","10.1002/14651858.CD007312.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007312.pub2","Neuromuscular"
"CD005607.PUB4","Dhiwakar, M; Clement, WA; Supriya, M; McKerrow, W","Antibiotics to reduce post‐tonsillectomy morbidity","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2012","Abstract - Background This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in  The Cochrane Library  in Issue 2, 2008 and previously updated in 2010. Tonsillectomy continues to be one of the most common surgical procedures performed in children and adults. Despite improvements in surgical and anaesthetic techniques, postoperative morbidity, mainly in the form of pain, remains a significant clinical problem. Postoperative bacterial infection of the tonsillar fossa has been proposed as an important factor causing pain and associated morbidity, and some studies have found a reduction in morbid outcomes following the administration of perioperative antibiotics. Objectives To determine whether perioperative antibiotics reduce pain and other morbid outcomes following tonsillectomy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 20 March 2012. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials examining the impact of perioperative administration of systemic antibiotics on post‐tonsillectomy morbidity in children or adults. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently collected data. Primary outcomes were pain, consumption of analgesia and secondary haemorrhage (defined as significant if patient re‐admitted, transfused blood products or returned to theatre, and total (any documented) haemorrhage). Secondary outcomes were fever, time taken to resume normal diet and activities and adverse events. Where possible, we generated summary measures using random‐effects models. Main results Ten trials, comprising a pooled total of 1035 participants, met the eligibility criteria. Most did not find a significant reduction in pain with antibiotics. Similarly, antibiotics were mostly not shown to be effective in reducing the need for analgesics. Antibiotics were not associated with a reduction in significant secondary haemorrhage rates (risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% CI 0.08 to 3.11, P = 0.45) or total secondary haemorrhage rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.44, P = 0.66). With regard to secondary outcomes, antibiotics reduced the proportion of patients with fever (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.85, P = 0.002). Authors' conclusions The present systematic review, including meta‐analyses for select outcomes, suggests that although individual studies vary in their findings, there is no evidence to support a consistent, clinically important impact of antibiotics in reducing the main morbid outcomes following tonsillectomy (i.e. pain, need for analgesia and secondary haemorrhage rates). The limited benefit apparent with antibiotics may be a result of positive bias introduced by several important methodological shortcomings in the included trials. Based on existing evidence, therefore, we would advocate against the routine prescription of antibiotics to patients undergoing tonsillectomy. Whether a subgroup of patients who might benefit from selective administration of antibiotics exists is unknown and needs to be explored in future trials. Plain language summary Antibiotics to reduce pain and improve recovery following tonsillectomy Tonsillectomy is a commonly performed operation in children and adults. Following the operation nearly all patients experience significant pain, need regular painkillers and are unable to resume normal diet and activities for several hours. Rarer but more dangerous complications, such as bleeding from the operated area, also occur. Antibiotics are commonly prescribed to reduce some or all of these undesirable consequences of tonsillectomy. The present review, however, suggests that antibiotics do not reduce pain, the need for painkillers or bleeding. They do, however, appear to reduce fever. This relatively minor benefit is more likely to be due to weaknesses in the studies themselves than any direct antibiotic effect. The risk of adverse events, such as skin rash and diarrhoea, is also slightly higher in patients who were prescribed antibiotics. Therefore, in the absence of clear‐cut and significant benefit, and with the potential for harm, we advocate against prescribing antibiotics routinely for patients undergoing tonsillectomy.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adult; Analgesics [administration & dosage]; Antibiotic Prophylaxis; Anti‐Bacterial Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Bacterial Infections [drug therapy]; Child; Convalescence; Fever [drug therapy]; Humans; Pain, Postoperative [*drug therapy, prevention & control]; Postoperative Hemorrhage [*drug therapy, etiology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tonsillectomy [*adverse effects]","10.1002/14651858.CD005607.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005607.pub4","ENT"
"CD006285.PUB2","Perera, R; Glasziou, PP; Heneghan, CJ; McLellan, J; Williamson, I","Autoinflation for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2013","Abstract - Background This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in  The Cochrane Library  in Issue 4, 2006. Otitis media with effusion (OME) or 'glue ear' is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation or infection. It is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and the usual reason for insertion of 'grommets'. Potential treatments include decongestants, mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines and antibiotics. Autoinflation devices have been proposed as a simple mechanical means of improving 'glue ear'. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of autoinflation compared with no treatment in children and adults with otitis media with effusion. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 12 April 2013. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials that compared any form of autoinflation to no autoinflation in individuals with 'glue ear'. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from included studies. Main results Eight studies, with a total of 702 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the studies were predominantly assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias; unclear risk was mainly due lack of information. There was no evidence of selective reporting. Pooled estimates favoured the intervention, but did not show a significant effect on tympanometry (type C2 and B) at less than one month, nor at more than one month. Similarly, there were no significant changes for discrete pure‐tone audiometry and non‐discrete audiometry. Pooled estimates favoured, but not significantly, the intervention for the composite measure of tympanogram or audiometry at less than one month; at more than one month the result became significant (RRI 1.74, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.50). Subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a Politzer device under one month (RRI 7.07, 95% CI 3.70 to 13.51) and over one month (RRI 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.04). None of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions. Authors' conclusions All of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and had short follow‐up. However, because of the low cost and absence of adverse effects it is reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion. Primary care could prove a beneficial place to evaluate such interventions and there is ongoing research in this area. Further research should also consider the duration of treatment, the long‐term impact on developmental outcomes in children and additional quality of life outcome measures for children and families. Plain language summary Autoinflation for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion (glue ear) Otitis media with effusion (OME) or 'glue ear' is very common in children and the hearing loss and discomfort, especially where the effusion is bilateral and long‐lasting, may lead to problems with language, development and behaviour. There are a number of treatment options including steroids, antibiotics, decongestants, antihistamines and surgery (the insertion of grommets (ventilation tubes)). Grommet insertion is one of the commonest operations of childhood. The best treatment strategy remains controversial, however, as glue ear often resolves spontaneously within a few months. Autoinflation is a technique whereby the Eustachian tube (the tube that connects the middle ear and the back of the nose) is reopened by raising pressure in the nose. This can be achieved by forced exhalation with closed mouth and nose, blowing up a balloon through each nostril or using an anaesthetic mask. The aim is to introduce air into the middle ear, via the Eustachian tube, equalising the pressures and allowing better drainage of the fluid. This review included eight randomised controlled trials of autoinflation for glue ear. All of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and had short follow‐up. The review authors used a combined outcome measure which included any outcome signifying improvement (as defined in the individual studies) and measured outcomes at the time points 'up to one month' and 'more than one month'. Improvement was demonstrated only in 'more than one month' analyses. Subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a Politzer device at both under one month and over one month. None of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions. The authors conclude that the evidence for the use of autoinflation in the short term appears favourable. Given the small number of studies and the lack of long‐term follow‐up, the long‐term effects associated with the use of these devices cannot be determined.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Eustachian Tube; Acoustic Impedance Tests [methods]; Adult; Air; Child; Hearing Loss [etiology, *therapy]; Humans; Insufflation [instrumentation, *methods]; Otitis Media with Effusion [complications, *therapy]; Pressure; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Valsalva Maneuver","10.1002/14651858.CD006285.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006285.pub2","ENT"

Chemotherapy has been introduced to improve survival and to reduce RT‐induced adverse effects. Reduction of RT‐induced adverse effects was achieved by deleting (craniospinal) RT in very young children and by diminishing the dose and field to the craniospinal axis and reducing the boost volume to the tumour bed in older children. Objectives Primary objectives: 1. to determine the event‐free survival/disease‐free survival (EFS/DFS) and overall survival (OS) in children with medulloblastoma receiving chemotherapy as a part of their primary treatment, as compared with children not receiving chemotherapy as part of their primary treatment; 2. to determine EFS/DFS and OS in children with medulloblastoma receiving standard‐dose RT without chemotherapy, as compared with children receiving reduced‐dose RT with chemotherapy as their primary treatment. Secondary objectives: to determine possible adverse effects of chemotherapy and RT, including long‐term adverse effects and effects on quality of life. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE/PubMed (1966 to August 2013) and EMBASE/Ovid (1980 to August 2013). In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and ongoing trial databases (August 2013). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the above treatments in children (aged 0 to 21 years) with medulloblastoma. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We performed analyses according to the guidelines of the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . Where possible, we pooled results. Main results The search identified seven RCTs, including 1080 children, evaluating treatment including chemotherapy and treatment not including chemotherapy. The meta‐analysis of EFS/DFS not including disease progression during therapy as an event in the definition showed a difference in favour of treatment including chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.91; P value = 0.007; 2 studies; 465 children). However, not including disease progression as an event might not be optimal and the finding was not confirmed in the meta‐analysis of EFS/DFS including disease progression during therapy as an event in the definition (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.47; P value = 0.93; 2 studies; 300 children). Two individual studies using unclear or other definitions of EFS/DFS also showed no clear evidence of difference between treatment arms (one study with unclear definition of DFS: HR 1.67; 95% CI 0.59 to 4.71; P value = 0.34; 48 children; one study with other definition of EFS: HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.21; P value = 0.34; 233 children). In addition, it should be noted that in one of the studies not including disease progression as an event, the difference in DFS only reached statistical significance while the study was running, but due to late relapses in the chemotherapy arm, this significance was no longer evident with longer follow‐up. There was no clear evidence of difference in OS between treatment arms (HR 1.06; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.67; P value = 0.80; 4 studies; 332 children). Out of eight reported adverse effects, of which seven were reported in one study, two (severe infections and fever/neutropenia) showed a difference in favour of treatment not including chemotherapy (severe infections: risk ratio (RR) 5.64; 95% CI 1.28 to 24.91; P value = 0.02; fever/neutropenia: RR not calculable; Fisher's exact P value = 0.01). There was no clear evidence of a difference between treatment arms for other adverse effects (acute alopecia: RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.08; P value = 1.00; reduction in intelligence quotient: RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.30; P value = 0.34; secondary malignancies: Fisher's exact P value = 0.5; haematological toxicity: RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.20 to 1.45; P value = 0.22; hepatotoxicity: Fisher's exact P value = 1.00; treatment‐related mortality: RR 2.37; 95% CI 0.43 to 12.98; P value = 0.32; 3 studies). Quality of life was not evaluated. In individual studies, the results in subgroups (i.e. younger/older children and high‐risk/non‐high‐risk children) were not univocal. The search found one RCT comparing standard‐dose RT with reduced‐dose RT plus chemotherapy. There was no clear evidence of a difference in EFS/DFS between groups (HR 1.54; 95% CI 0.81 to 2.94; P value = 0.19; 76 children). The RCT did not evaluate other outcomes and subgroups. The presence of bias could not be ruled out in any of the studies. Authors' conclusions Based on the evidence identified in this systematic review, a benefit of chemotherapy cannot be excluded, but at this moment we are unable to draw a definitive conclusion regarding treatment with or without chemotherapy. Treatment results must be viewed in the context of the complete therapy (e.g. the effect of surgery and craniospinal RT), and the different chemotherapy protocols used. This systematic review only allowed a conclusion on the concept of treatment, not on the best strategy regarding specific chemotherapeutic agents and radiation dose. Several factors complicated the interpretation of results including the long time span between studies with important changes in treatment in the meantime. 'No evidence of effect', as identified in this review, is not the same as 'evidence of no effect'. The fact that no significant differences between treatment arms were identified could, besides the earlier mentioned reasons, also be the result of low power or too short a follow‐up period. Even though RCTs are the highest level of evidence, it should be recognised that data from non‐randomised studies are available, for example on the use of chemotherapy only in very young children with promising results for children without metastatic disease. We found only one RCT addressing standard‐dose RT without chemotherapy versus reduced‐dose RT with chemotherapy, so no definitive conclusions can be made. More high‐quality research is needed. Plain language summary Chemotherapy for children with medulloblastoma Background Medulloblastoma is one of the most common malignant brain tumours in children. Chemotherapy is used to improve survival and diminish potential radiotherapy‐induced side effects. The reduction of radiotherapy‐induced side effects is achieved in very young children by not treating them with radiotherapy and in older children by diminishing the craniospinal radiotherapy (radiotherapy applied to the brain and spinal cord) dose and by reducing the boost volume to the tumour bed only instead of the whole posterior fossa (part of the brain). A well‐informed decision on the use of chemotherapy in the treatment of medulloblastoma in children should be based on high‐quality evidence on both the effectiveness against the tumour and side effects. Study characteristics We searched databases for randomised trials (studies where participants are allocated to one of two or more treatment groups in a random manner) evaluating the effectiveness of treatment including chemotherapy versus treatment not including chemotherapy (seven available studies) and on randomised studies evaluating the effectiveness of standard‐dose radiotherapy without chemotherapy versus reduced‐dose radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (one available study) in children (aged 0 to 21 years). The evidence is current to August 2013. Key results and quality of the evidence Based on the evidence identified in this systematic review a benefit of chemotherapy cannot be excluded, but at this moment we are unable to draw a definitive conclusion to favour treatment with or without chemotherapy. Even though randomised studies are the highest level of evidence, it should be recognised that data from non‐randomised studies were available, for example on the use of chemotherapy only in very young children. The results are promising for children without metastatic disease. For treatment with standard‐dose radiotherapy without chemotherapy as compared with reduced‐dose radiotherapy with chemotherapy, we also cannot make definitive recommendations. More high‐quality research is needed.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols [*therapeutic use]; Cerebellar Neoplasms [*drug therapy, mortality, radiotherapy]; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease‐Free Survival; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Medulloblastoma [*drug therapy, mortality, radiotherapy]; Radiotherapy Dosage; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD006678.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006678.pub2","Childhood Cancer"
"CD006311.PUB4","Evans, AM; Rome, K; Carroll, M; Hawke, F","Foot orthoses for treating paediatric flat feet","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2022","Abstract - Background Paediatric flat feet are a common presentation in primary care; reported prevalence approximates 15%. A minority of flat feet can hurt and limit gait. There is no optimal strategy, nor consensus, for using foot orthoses (FOs) to treat paediatric flat feet. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of foot orthoses for treating paediatric flat feet. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to 01 September 2021, and two clinical trials registers on 07 August 2020. Selection criteria We identified all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of FOs as an intervention for paediatric flat feet. The outcomes included in this review were pain, function, quality of life, treatment success, and adverse events. Intended comparisons were: any FOs versus sham, any FOs versus shoes, customised FOs (CFOs) versus prefabricated FOs (PFOs). Data collection and analysis We followed standard methods recommended by Cochrane. Main results We included 16 trials with 1058 children, aged 11 months to 19 years, with flexible flat feet. Distinct flat foot presentations included asymptomatic, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), symptomatic and developmental co‐ordination disorder (DCD). The trial interventions were FOs, footwear, foot and rehabilitative exercises, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Due to heterogeneity, we did not pool the data. Most trials had potential for selection, performance, detection, and selective reporting bias. No trial blinded participants. We present the results separately for asymptomatic (healthy children) and symptomatic (children with JIA) flat feet. The certainty of evidence was very low to low, downgraded for bias, imprecision, and indirectness. Three comparisons were evaluated across trials: CFO versus shoes; PFO versus shoes; CFO versus PFO. Asymptomatic flat feet 1.  CFOs versus shoes  (1 trial, 106 participants): low‐quality evidence showed that CFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10‐point visual analogue scale (VAS)) at one year (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.07); absolute decrease (11.8%, 95% CI 4.7% fewer to 15.8% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19); absolute effect (3.4% more, 95% CI 4.1% fewer to 13.1% more). 2.  PFOs versus shoes  (1 trial, 106 participants): low to very‐low quality evidence showed that PFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10‐point VAS) at one year (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.16); absolute effect (4.7% fewer, 95% CI 18.9% fewer to 12.6% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23). 3.  CFOs versus PFOs  (1 trial, 108 participants): low‐quality evidence found no difference in the proportion without pain at one year (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18); absolute effect (7.4% fewer, 95% CI 22.2% fewer to 11.1% more); or on withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.12). Function and quality of life (QoL) were not assessed. Symptomatic (JIA) flat feet 1.  CFOs versus shoes  (1 trial, 28 participants, 3‐month follow‐up): very low‐quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain (0 to 10 scale, 0 no pain) between groups (MD ‐1.5, 95% CI ‐2.78 to ‐0.22). Low‐quality evidence showed improvements in function with CFOs (Foot Function Index ‐ FFI disability, 0 to 100, 0 best function; MD ‐18.55, 95% CI ‐34.42 to ‐2.68), child‐rated QoL (PedsQL, 0 to 100, 100 best quality; MD 12.1, 95% CI ‐1.6 to 25.8) and parent‐rated QoL (PedsQL MD 9, 95% CI ‐4.1 to 22.1) and little or no difference between groups in treatment success (timed walking; MD ‐1.33 seconds, 95% CI ‐2.77 to 0.11), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.94); absolute difference (9.7% fewer, 20.5 % fewer to 44.8% more). 2.  PFOs versus shoes  (1 trial, 25 participants, 3‐month follow‐up): very low‐quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain between groups (MD 0.02, 95% CI ‐1.94 to 1.98). Low‐quality evidence showed no difference between groups in function (FFI‐disability MD ‐4.17, 95% CI ‐24.4 to 16.06), child‐rated QoL (PedsQL MD ‐3.84, 95% CI ‐19 to 11.33), or parent‐rated QoL (PedsQL MD ‐0.64, 95% CI ‐13.22 to 11.94). 3.  CFOs versus PFOs  (2 trials, 87 participants): low‐quality evidence showed little or no difference between groups in pain (0 to 10 scale, 0 no pain) at 3 months (MD ‐1.48, 95% CI ‐3.23 to 0.26), function (FFI‐disability MD ‐7.28, 95% CI ‐15.47 to 0.92), child‐rated QoL (PedsQL MD 8.6, 95% CI ‐3.9 to 21.2), or parent‐rated QoL (PedsQL MD 2.9, 95% CI ‐11 to 16.8). Authors' conclusions Low to very low‐certainty evidence shows that the effect of CFOs (high cost) or PFOs (low cost) versus shoes, and CFOs versus PFOs on pain, function and HRQoL is uncertain. This is pertinent for clinical practice, given the economic disparity between CFOs and PFOs. FOs may improve pain and function, versus shoes in children with JIA, with minimal delineation between costly CFOs and generic PFOs. This review updates that from 2010, confirming that in the absence of pain, the use of high‐cost CFOs for healthy children with flexible flat feet has no supporting evidence, and draws very limited conclusions about FOs for treating paediatric flat feet. The availability of normative and prospective foot development data, dismisses most flat foot concerns, and negates continued attention to this topic. Attention should be re‐directed to relevant paediatric foot conditions, which cause pain, limit function, or reduce quality of life. The agenda for researching asymptomatic flat feet in healthy children must be relegated to history, and replaced by a targeted research rationale, addressing children with indisputable foot pathology from discrete diagnoses, namely JIA, cerebral palsy, congenital talipes equino varus, trisomy 21 and Charcot Marie Tooth. Whether research resources should continue to be wasted on studying flat feet in healthy children that do not hurt, is questionable. Future updates of this review will address only relevant paediatric foot conditions. Plain language summary Foot orthoses for treating flat feet in children Review question What are the benefits and harms of using foot orthoses (shoe inserts) to treat flat feet in children? Background Children with flat feet have a lower foot arch. When the child is standing, the foot arch looks flat against the floor, and may roll inwards, and even touch the floor. Sometimes, flat feet can cause pain, or change the way a child walks. There are many types of non‐surgical treatments for flat feet, but unless painful, most children do not need any treatment. Foot orthoses (FOs) or shoe inserts, muscle stretching, footwear selection, physical activity modification, and reducing body weight, may be part of an overall foot and activity management. The short‐term use of medication for pain and inflammation may be prescribed. Study characteristics This Cochrane Review is current to September 2021. There are 16 studies (1058 children, aged 11 months to 19 years) including three groups ‐ healthy children with painless flat feet; children with arthritis and painful flat feet; others (developmental coordination disorder; painful flat feet). The studies were conducted across the USA, Australia, India, Iran, Turkey, UK, and Republic of Korea. We found information about footwear, exercises, and different types of foot orthoses. Results: Comparing custom foot orthoses  ( CFOs) to shoes in painless flat feet: Proportion without pain (1 trial, 106 children) at 12 months: 12% fewer children with CFOs were without pain (ranging from 26% fewer to 5.5% more) 67 out of 100 children were without pain with CFOs compared to 79 children out of 100 with shoes. Withdrawal due to side effects (3 trials, 211 children): 3% more children with CFOs withdrew from treatment due to side effects (ranging from 4% fewer to 13% more) . 72 out of 100 children withdrew from treatment with CFOs compared with 69 children out of 100 with shoes. Comparing prefabricated foot orthoses (PFOs) to shoes in painless flat feet Proportion without pain (1 trial, 106 children) at 12 months: 5% fewer children with PFOs were without pain (ranging from 18.9% fewer to 12.6% more) 74 out of 100 children were without pain with PFOs compared to 79 out of 100 children with shoes. Withdrawal due to side effects (4 trials, 338 children): 0.7% fewer children with PFOs withdrew from treatment due to side effects (ranging from 15.2% fewer to 16.6% more). 71 out of 100 children withdrew from treatment with PFOs compared with 72 out of 100 children with shoes. Comparing CFOs to PFOs in painless flat feet Proportion without pain (1 trial, 106 children) at 12 months: 7% fewer children with CFOs were without pain (ranging from 22.2% fewer to 11.1% more) 68 out of 100 children were without pain with CFOs compared to 74 out of 100 children with PFOs. Withdrawal due to side effects (1 trial, 118 children): 0% fewer children withdrew from treatment with CFOs due to side effects (ranging from 9.2% fewer to 11% more). 91 out of 100 children withdrew from treatment with CFOs compared with 91 out of 100 children with PFOs. Function, quality of life, treatment success and side effects were not reported in these trials Quality of the evidence In healthy children with painless flat feet, low to very low‐quality evidence shows that compared to shoes, CFOs and PFOs result in no difference in the proportion without pain or withdrawal due to side effects from treatment. The quality of the evidence is very low to low, weakening conclusions. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because the trials were poorly conducted and there were not enough data.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Flatfoot [therapy]; *Foot Orthoses; Child; Humans; Pain; Pain Measurement; Quality of Life","10.1002/14651858.CD006311.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006311.pub4","Musculoskeletal"

The syndrome is associated with loud snoring, disrupted sleep and observed apnoeas. Surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome aims to alleviate symptoms of daytime sleepiness, improve quality of life, and reduce the signs of sleep apnoea recorded by polysomnography. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the effects of any type of surgery for the treatment of the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles. We contacted experts in the field, research dissemination bodies and other Cochrane Review Groups. Searches were current as of July 2008. Selection criteria Randomised trials comparing any surgical intervention for obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome with other surgical or non‐surgical interventions or no intervention. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers assessed electronic literature search results for possibly relevant studies. Characteristics and data from studies meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted and entered into RevMan 5. Main results Twelve studies (709 participants) of mixed risk of bias met the inclusion criteria. Data from ten studies were eligible for assessment in the review. The participants recruited to the studies had mixed levels of AHI, but tended to suffer from moderate daytime sleepiness where this was measured. No data could be pooled.  Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) versus conservative management (one trial) : An un‐validated symptom score showed intermittent significant differences over a 12‐month follow‐up period. No differences in Polysomnography (PSG) outcomes were reported.  Laser‐assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP) versus conservative management/placebo (two trials) : One study recruited a mixed population and separate data could not be obtained for this trial. In the other study no significant differences in Epworth scores or quality of life reported. A significant difference in favour of LAUP was reported in terms of apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) and frequency and intensity of snoring.  Palatal implants versus placebo (one trial):  Symptoms and AHI were lower with palatal implants.  LAUP versus bipolar radiofrequency volumetric tissue reduction (one trial) : Within‐treatment group differences were significant for symptoms and AHI, but the between treatment group differences were not available to assess whether indirect inferences could be made regarding the effects of either treatment.  UPPP versus oral appliance (OA) (one trial) : AHI was significantly lower with OA therapy than with UPPP. No significant differences were observed in quality of life.  UPPP versus lateral pharyngoplasty (lateral PP) (one trial) : No significant difference in Epworth scores, but a greater reduction in AHI with lateral PP was reported.  Expansion sphincter pharyngoplasty (one trial):  Both interventions reduced AHI although statistical analysis on the difference between treatments was not reported.  Tongue advancement (mandibular osteotomy) + PPP versus tongue suspension + PPP (one trial) : There was a significant reduction in symptoms in both groups, but no significant difference between the two surgery types. Complications reported with all surgical techniques included nasal regurgitation, pain and bleeding. These did not persist in the long term. An additional study assessed the effects of four different techniques. No data were available on between group comparisons.  Multilevel temperature‐controlled radiofrequency tissue ablation (TCRFTA) versus sham placebo and CPAP (one trial):  There was an improvement in primary and secondary outcomes of TCRFTA over sham placebo and but no difference in symptomatic improvement when compared with CPAP.  Radiofrequency assisted uvulopalatoplasty technique versus channeling technique (one trial):  Dysphagia scores were lower in the channeling group immediately post‐operation, but at four months the difference was no longer significant. Snoring scores did not differ at long‐term follow‐up. The number of participants achieving AHI lower than 10 at four months was slightly higher with RAUP than channeling technique. Authors' conclusions There are now a small number of trials assessing different surgical techniques with inactive and active control treatments. The studies assembled in the review have failed to demonstrate consistent effects in favour of surgery and do not provide convincing evidence to support its use in sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome. Short‐term outcomes are unlikely to consistently identify suitable candidates for surgery. Long‐term follow‐up of patients who undergo surgical correction of upper airway obstruction is required. This would help to determine whether surgery is a curative intervention, or whether there is a tendency for the signs and symptoms of sleep apnoea to re‐assert themselves, prompting patients to seek further treatment for sleep apnoea. Plain language summary Surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome Surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome aims to relieve obstruction by increasing the size of the airway in the throat, bypassing the airway or removing a lesion. A limited number of trials assessing diverse surgical techniques were identified. There were inconsistent effects reported across the trials. The available evidence from these small studies does not currently support the widespread use of surgery in people with mild to moderate daytime sleepiness associated with sleep apnoea.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adult; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nasal Obstruction [surgery]; Pharynx [surgery]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive [*surgery]","10.1002/14651858.CD001004.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001004.pub2","Airways"

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005 and last updated in 2008. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different designs of intramedullary nails for treating extracapsular hip fractures in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (6 January 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library  Issue 12, 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to November Week 3, 2013), MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (3 January 2014), EMBASE (1988 to 2014, Week 1) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (accessed January 2014). Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised trials comparing different types, or design modifications, of intramedullary nails in the treatment of extracapsular hip fractures in adults. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We performed limited meta‐analysis using the fixed‐effect model. Main results We included eight new trials, testing seven new comparisons in this update. Overall, we included 17 trials, testing 12 comparisons of different cephalocondylic nail designs. The trials involved a total of 2130 adults (predominantly female and older people) with mainly unstable trochanteric fractures. All trials were at unclear risk of bias for most domains, with the majority at high risk of detection bias for subjective outcomes. The three quasi‐randomised trials were at high risk for selection bias. Four trials (910 participants) compared the proximal femoral nail (PFN) with the Gamma nail. There was no significant difference between the two implants in functional outcome (the very low quality evidence being limited to results from single trials), mortality (low quality evidence: 86/415 versus 80/415; risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.41), serious fixation complications (operative fracture of the femur, cut‐out, non‐union and later fracture of the femur) nor re‐operations (low quality evidence: 45/455 versus 36/455; RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.90). Two trials (185 participants) provided very low quality evidence of a lack of clinically significant difference in outcome (functional score, mortality, fracture fixation complications and re‐operation) between the ACE trochanteric nail and the Gamma nail. Two trials (200 participants) provided very low quality evidence of a lack of significant difference in outcome (mobility score, pain, fracture fixation complications or re‐operations) between the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) nail and the Gamma 3 nail. Seven of the nine trials evaluating different comparisons provided very low quality evidence of a lack of significant between‐group differences in all of the reported main outcomes for the following comparisons: ACE trochanteric nail versus Gamma 3 nail (112 participants); gliding nail versus Gamma nail (80 participants); Russell‐Taylor Recon nail versus long Gamma nail (34 participants, all under 50 years); proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) nail versus Targon PF nail (80 participants); dynamically versus statically locked intramedullary hip screw (IMHS) nail (81 participants); sliding versus non‐sliding Gamma 3 nail (80 participants, all under 60 years); and long versus standard PFNA nails (40 participants with reverse oblique fractures). The other two single comparison trials also provided very low quality evidence of a lack of significant between‐group differences in all of the main outcomes with single exceptions. The trial (215 participants) comparing the ENDOVIS nail versus the IMHS nail found low quality evidence of poorer mobility in the ENDOVIS nail group, where more participants in this group were bedridden after their operation (29/105 versus 18/110; RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.85; P = 0.05). The trial (113 participants) comparing the InterTan nail versus the PFNA II nail found very low quality evidence that more PFNA II group participants experienced thigh pain (3/47 versus 12/46; RR: 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.81). Authors' conclusions The limited evidence from the randomised trials undertaken to date is insufficient to determine whether there are important differences in outcome between different designs of intramedullary nails used in treating extracapsular hip fractures. Given the evidence of superiority of the sliding hip screw compared with intramedullary nails for extracapsular hip fractures, further studies comparing different designs of intramedullary nails are not a priority. Any new design should be evaluated in a randomised comparison with the sliding hip screw. Plain language summary Intramedullary nails for extracapsular hip fractures in adults What is the medical problem? Fractures of the upper part of the thigh bone (femur) are termed hip or proximal femoral fractures. These fractures are most common in women aged over 65 years. Roughly two out of five hip fractures are 'extracapsular' in that they lie outside the hip joint capsule. What treatments are available? The majority of these fractures are fixed surgically using metal implants. One increasingly used implant is the 'intramedullary nail'. This consists of a metal rod, which is usually inserted from the upper end of the femur into the inner cavity (medulla) of the femur bone and held in place with screws. There are several different types of nails, usually made by different manufacturers, in use. Are some intramedullary nails better than others for these fractures? This review set out to examine the evidence from trials that compared different designs of nails in clinical practice. We searched medical databases and registers of new studies (until January 2014) and found 17 trials that compared different nail designs. These involved a total of 2130 participants. Most participants were older women. The quality of the evidence from these trials is low or very low, partly because most trials used flawed methods that mean their results may not be reliable. In addition, several trials did not report on function or provide data that could be used. Of the 12 different comparisons tested, nine were tested by one trial only. Four trials compared the proximal femoral nail (PFN) with the Gamma nail in 910 older adults. Two trials compared the ACE intramedullary nail with the Gamma nail in 185 older adults. Two trials compared the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) with the Gamma 3 nail in 200 older adults. The other nine trials were single comparisons of different types of nail designs. Overall, the weak evidence available for all 12 comparisons showed no important differences in outcome (function, mobility, pain, death, fracture fixation complications and revision surgery) between the two nails or two nail designs under test. There was one possible exception. There was weak evidence from one trial of 215 older adults that the ENDOVIS nail resulted in poorer mobility (more people could not walk after their operation) when compared with the intramedullary hip screw (IMHS). However, more evidence is required to be confident of this result. In conclusion, the available evidence is insufficient to determine whether there are important differences in outcome between different designs of intramedullary nails used for fixing extracapsular hip fractures. In terms of future research, we propose that priority is given to comparisons of intramedullary nails with another type of device in common use, the sliding hip screw.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Bone Nails; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary [adverse effects, instrumentation, *methods]; Hip Fractures [*surgery]; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Prosthesis Design; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD004961.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004961.pub4","Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma"
"CD003707.PUB3","Galvin, IM; Steel, A; Pinto, R; Ferguson, ND; Davies, MW","Partial liquid ventilation for preventing death and morbidity in adults with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2013","Abstract - Background Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are syndromes of severe respiratory failure that are associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. Artifical ventilatory support is commonly required and may exacerbate lung injury. Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) has been proposed as a less injurious form of ventilatory support for these patients. Although PLV has been shown to improve gas exchange and to reduce inflammation in experimental models of ALI, a previous systematic review did not find any evidence to support or refute its use in humans with ALI and ARDS. Objectives The primary objective of this review was to assess whether PLV reduced mortality (at 28 d, at discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU), at discharge from hospital and at one, two and five years) in adults with ALI or ARDS when compared with conventional ventilatory support. Secondary objectives were to determine how PLV compared with conventional ventilation with regard to duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of respiratory support, duration of oxygen therapy, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, incidence of infection, long‐term cognitive impairment, long‐term health related quality of life, long‐ term lung function, long‐term morbidity costs and adverse events. The following adverse events were considered: hypoxia (arterial PO 2  <80 mm Hg), pneumothorax (any air leak into the pleural space requiring therapeutic intervention), hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg sustained for longer than two minutes or requiring treatment with fluids or vasoactive drugs), bradycardia (heart rate < 50 beats per minute sustained for longer than one minute or requiring therapeutic intervention) and cardiac arrest (absence of effective cardiac output). Search methods In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 10, 2012, in  The Cochrane Library ; MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1966 to November 2012); EMBASE (Ovid SP, 1980 to November 2012) and CINAHL (EBSCOhost,1982 to November 2012) for published studies. In our original review, we searched until May 2004. Grey literature was identified by searching conference proceedings and trial registries and by contacting experts in the field. Selection criteria As in the original review, review authors selected randomized controlled trials that compared PLV with other forms of ventilation in adults (16 y of age or older) with ALI or ARDS, reporting one or more of the following: mortality; duration of mechanical ventilation, respiratory support, oxygen therapy, stay in the intensive care unit or stay in hospital; infection; long‐term cognitive impairment or health‐related quality of life; long‐term lung function or cost. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently evaluated the quality of the relevant studies and extracted the data from included studies. Main results In this updated review, one new eligible study was identified and included, yielding a total of two eligible studies (including a combined total of 401 participants). Of those 401 participants, 170 received 'high'‐dose partial liquid ventilation (i.e. a mean dose of at least 20 mL/kg), 99 received 'low‐dose' partial liquid ventilation (i.e. a dose of 10 mL/kg) and 132 received conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV). Pooled estimates of effect were calculated for all those who received 'high'‐dose PLV versus conventional ventilation. No evidence indicated that 'high'‐dose PLV either reduced mortality at 28 d (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.85, P = 0.37) or increased the number of days free of CMV at 28 d (mean difference (MD) ‐2.24, 95% CI ‐4.71 to 0.23, P = 0.08). The pooled estimate of effect for bradycardia in those who received PLV was significantly greater than in those who received CMV (RR 2.51, 95% CI 1.31 to 4.81, P = 0.005). Pooled estimates of effect for the following adverse events－hypoxia, pneumothorax, hypotension and cardiac arrest－all showed a nonsignificant trend towards a higher occurrence of these events in those treated with PLV. Because neither eligible study addressed morbidity or mortality beyond 28 d, it was not possible to determine the effect of PLV on these outcomes. Authors' conclusions No evidence supports the use of PLV in ALI or ARDS; some evidence suggests an increased risk of adverse events associated with its use. Plain language summary No evidence of benefit of partial liquid ventilation in adults with acute lung injury and some evidence of increased risk associated with its use Seriously ill adults can get a severe lung disease called  acute lung injury  or  acute respiratory distress syndrome,  which stops enough oxygen from getting into the blood. About half of these patients die, and for those who survive, it can take several years to get back to near normal. At the height of their illness, many of these patients are unable to breathe properly and need the assistance of a breathing machine called a  ventilator , which pushes gas into the lungs under pressure through a process called  artifical ventilation . Artifical ventilation can cause further damage to the lungs. The need to support breathing for these patients, while avoiding further lung damage, has led to a search for gentler types of ventilation. One such gentler type of ventilation is called  partial liquid ventilation . It uses a special liquid called  perfluorocarbon  instead of the gas used by traditional ventilators. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine whether patients with acute lung injury who received partial liquid ventilation were less likely to die or were more likely to recover completely than those who received traditional gas ventilation. To provide the best possible answer to this question, this review was conducted in a special preplanned way with the intention of putting together the results of all selected studies to produce an overall measure of the value of partial liquid ventilation. Two eligible studies (including a total of 401 participants) were found, and a comparison was made between those who received similar doses of perfluorocarbon and those who received traditional ventilation. No evidence indicated that partial liquid ventilation reduced the risk of death or the duration of artifical ventilation, and some evidence suggested that it may increase the risk of complications, including low blood oxygen levels, low heart rate, low blood pressure, air leakage from the lungs and cardiac collapse.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Acute Lung Injury [mortality, *therapy]; Adult; Humans; Liquid Ventilation [*methods]; Morbidity; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Distress Syndrome [mortality, *therapy]","10.1002/14651858.CD003707.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003707.pub3","Emergency and Critical Care"

Children with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome have high mortality and the survivors have significant morbidity. Partial liquid ventilation is proposed as a less injurious form of respiratory support for these children. Uncontrolled studies in adults have shown improvements in gas exchange and lung compliance with partial liquid ventilation. A single uncontrolled study in six children with acute respiratory syndrome showed some improvement in gas exchange during three hours of partial liquid ventilation. This review was originally published in 2004, updated in 2009 and again in 2012. Objectives To assess whether partial liquid ventilation reduces mortality or morbidity, or both, in children with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Search methods In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 11); CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature) via Ovid (1982 to November 2011); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to November 2011); and Ovid EMBASE (1982 to November 2011). The search was last performed in August 2008. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared partial liquid ventilation with other forms of ventilation in children (aged 28 days to 18 years) with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Trials had to report one or more of the following: mortality; duration of mechanical ventilation, respiratory support, oxygen therapy, stay in the intensive care unit, or stay in hospital; infection; long‐term cognitive impairment, neurodevelopmental progress, or other long‐term morbidities. Data collection and analysis We independently evaluated the quality of the relevant studies and extracted the data from the included studies. Main results Only one study enrolling 182 patients (reported as an abstract in conference proceedings) was identified and found eligible for inclusion; the authors reported only limited results. The trial was stopped prematurely and was, therefore, under‐powered to detect any significant differences and at high risk of bias. The only available outcome of clinical significance was 28‐day mortality. There was no statistically significant difference between groups, with a relative risk for 28‐day mortality in the partial liquid ventilation group of 1.54 (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 2.9). Authors' conclusions There is no evidence from RCTs to support or refute the use of partial liquid ventilation in children with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Adequately powered, high quality RCTs are still needed to assess its efficacy. Clinically relevant outcome measures should be assessed (mortality at discharge and later, duration of both respiratory support and hospital stay, and long‐term neurodevelopmental outcomes). The studies should be published in full. Plain language summary Partial liquid ventilation for mechanical ventilation of severely ill children with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome The use of partial liquid ventilation to decrease the number of deaths and illness in children with acute onset respiratory failure is not supported by evidence from randomized controlled trials. Severely ill children can develop lung disease, called acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome, which stops sufficient oxygenation of the blood. The children are treated with mechanical ventilation through a tube placed in the airway. This improves lung function and the supply of oxygen to the body but it can also lead to ventilator‐induced lung injury. Children who survive an episode of this severe lung disease often have long‐term illness including decreased lung function, impaired cognitive function, poor neurodevelopmental progress, and high rates of permanent disability. Partial liquid ventilation could be a less injurious form of respiratory support. A special liquid (perfluorocarbon liquid) is poured into the lungs to partly replace the gas in the normally gas‐filled lungs, and mechanical ventilation is continued with a gas ventilator. We found only one multicentre randomized controlled study, reported as an abstract in conference proceedings, that was eligible for inclusion in this updated Cochrane review. The company sponsored study enrolled 182 patients in 65 centres. The trial was stopped early, before recruiting sufficient numbers of participants and before it could detect any clear differences between partial liquid ventilation and conventional mechanical ventilation (the control group). The number of deaths at 28 days was 22% of patients in the partial liquid ventilation group and 14% in the control group, the difference was not statistically significant; there was a wide variation in results and a clinically significant difference could not be excluded. There were other problems with the trial that made its results unreliable in terms of eligible patients, use of other rescue therapies, and that the measured outcomes were altered at least twice during the study; additional therapies such as high frequency ventilation or inhaled nitric oxide were allowed in the control group.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Acute Lung Injury [complications, mortality, *therapy]; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Liquid Ventilation [*methods, mortality]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Distress Syndrome [complications, mortality, *therapy]; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn [complications, mortality, *therapy]","10.1002/14651858.CD003845.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003845.pub3","Emergency and Critical Care"

PVR usually occurs in association with recurrent RD (that is, after initial retinal re‐attachment surgery), but occasionally may be associated with primary RD. Either way, for both circumstances a tamponade agent (gas or silicone oil) is needed during surgery to reduce the rate of postoperative recurrent RD. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the relative safety and effectiveness of various tamponade agents used with surgery for RD complicated by PVR. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to January 2019), Embase (January 1980 to January 2019), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2019), the  meta Register of Controlled Trials ( m RCT) (www.controlled‐trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 January 2019. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on participants undergoing surgery for RD associated with PVR that compared various tamponade agents. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened the search results independently. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We identified four RCTs (601 participants) that provided data for the primary and secondary outcomes. Three RCTs provided data on visual acuity, two reported on macular attachment, one on retinal reattachment and another two on adverse events such as RD, worsening visual acuity and intraocular pressure. Study Characteristics Participants' characteristics varied across studies and across intervention groups, with an age range between 21 to 89 years, and were predominantly men. The Silicone Study was conducted in the USA and consisted of two RCTs: (silicone oil versus sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) gas tamponades; 151 participants) and (silicone oil versus perfluropropane (C 3 F 8 ) gas tamponades; 271 participants). The third RCT compared heavy silicone oil (a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F 6 H 8 ) and silicone oil) with standard silicone oil (either 1000 centistokes or 5000 centistokes; 94 participants). The fourth RCT compared 1000 centistokes with 5000 centistokes silicone oil in 85 participants. We assessed most RCTs at low or unclear risk of bias for most 'Risk of bias' domains. Findings Although SF 6  gas was reported to be associated with worse anatomic and visual outcomes than was silicone oil at one year (quantitative data not reported), at two years, silicone oil compared to SF 6  gas showed no evidence of a difference in visual acuity (33% versus 51%; risk ratio (RR) 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 2.66; 1 RCT, 87 participants; low‐certainty evidence). At one year, another RCT comparing silicone oil and C 3 F 8  gas found no evidence of a difference in visual acuity between the two groups (41% versus 39%; RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.31; 1 RCT, 264 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In a third RCT, participants treated with standard silicone oil compared to those receiving heavy silicone oil also showed no evidence of a difference in the change in visual acuity at one year, measured on logMAR scale ( mean difference ‐0.03 logMAR; 95% CI ‐0.35 to 0.29; 1 RCT; 93 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The fourth RCT with 5000‐centistoke and 1000‐centistoke comparisons did not report data on visual acuity. For macular attachment, participants treated with silicone oil may probably experience more favorable outcomes than did participants who received SF 6  at both one year (quantitative data not reported) and two years (58% versus 79%; RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.86; 1 RCT; 87 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In another RCT, silicone oil compared to C 3 F 8  at one year found no evidence of difference in macular attachment (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 1 RCT, 264 participants; low‐certainty evidence). One RCT that compared 5000 centistokes to 1000 centistoke reported that retinal reattachment was successful in 67 participants (78.8%) with first surgery and 79 participants (92.9%) with the second surgery, and no evidence of between‐group difference (1 RCT; 85 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The fourth RCT that compared standard silicone oil with heavy silicone oil did not report on macular attachment. Adverse events In one RCT (86 participants), those receiving standard 1000 centistoke silicone oil compared with those of the 5000 centistoke silicone oil showed no evidence of a difference in intraocular pressure elevation at 18 months (24% versus 22%; RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.41 to 1.94; low‐certainty evidence), visually significant cataract (49% versus 64%; RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.89; low‐certainty evidence), and incidence of retina detachment after the removal of silicone oil (RR 0.36 95% CI 0.08 to 1.67; low‐certainty evidence). Another RCT that compared standard silicone oil with heavy silicone oil suggests no difference in retinal detachment at one year (25% versus 22%; RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.48; 1 RCT; 186 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Retinal detachment was not reported in the RCTs that compared silicone oil versus SF 6  and silicone oil versus to C 3 F 8 . Authors' conclusions There do not appear to be any major differences in outcomes between C 3 F 8  and silicone oil. Silicone oil may be better than SF 6  for macular attachment and other short‐term outcomes. The choice of a tamponade agent should be individualized for each patient. The use of either C 3 F 8  or standard silicone oil appears reasonable for most patients with RD associated with PVR. Heavy silicone oil, which is not available for routine clinical use in the USA, may not demonstrate evidence of superiority over standard silicone oil. Plain language summary Tamponade in surgery for retinal detachment associated with proliferative vitreoretinopathy What is the aim of this review?  The aim of this Cochrane Review was to determine if substances called tamponade agents used to treat retinal detachment (RD) associated with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) are safe and effective. PVR refers to the growth and scarring of the retina. Key messages The choice of a tamponade agent should be individualized for each patient. The use of either C 3 F 8  (one type of gas) or standard silicone oil appears reasonable. Heavy silicone oil, which is not available for routine clinical use in the USA, has no advantage or benefit over standard silicone oil. What was studied in this review?  Retina is the innermost light‐sensing tissue in the back of the eye (similar to the film within a camera), and its normal function depends on its attachment to the underlying layer. RD is a disorder of the eye in which the retina physically separates from the underlying layer of tissue. The macula is the centermost part of the retina and is responsible for the central, high‐resolution, color vision. Patients with RD that involves the macular typically have more severe visual loss than patients without associated macular detachment. RD is generally treated with surgery, but surgery is not always successful. In some patients, surgery is initially successful but RD may recur months or years later. Most recurrent RDs, and some primary RDs, are associated with growth and scarring of the retina called proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). The only proven therapy for RD with PVR is further surgery, where the membranes are removed from the surface of the retina and tamponade agents injected into the eye to hold the newly attached retina in place. The major tamponade agents that are available today are various gases and silicone oils. It is unknown whether these tamponade agents are effective and safe.   What are the main results of the review?  We found four randomized controlled trials with a total of 601 participants that compared various tamponade agents. All participants underwent surgery to treat RD associated with PVR. There do not appear to be any major differences between C 3 F 8  (one type of gas) and silicone oil in terms of sharpness of vision (visual acuity) or attachment of the retina to the macula, the oval‐shaped area near the center of the retina. Silicone oil may be better than SF 6  (another type of gas) for attachment of the retina to the macula and other short‐term outcomes. How up‐to‐date is this review?  Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to 2 January 2019.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Fluorocarbons [*administration & dosage]; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Macula Lutea; Male; Middle Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Retinal Detachment [etiology, prevention & control, *therapy]; Secondary Prevention; Silicone Oils [*administration & dosage]; Sulfur Hexafluoride [*administration & dosage]; Visual Acuity; Vitreoretinopathy, Proliferative [*complications]; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006126.pub4","Eyes and Vision"
