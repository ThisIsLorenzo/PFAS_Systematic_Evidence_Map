Microbial biotransformation of aqueous film-forming foam derived polyfluoroalkyl substances,"Choi Y.J., Helbling D.E., Liu J., Olivares C.I., Higgins C.P.",2022,Science of the Total Environment,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) used in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) comprise some perfluoroalkyl substances but a larger variety of polyfluoroalkyl substances. Despite their abundance in AFFF, information is lacking on the potential transformation of these polyfluoroalkyl substances. Due to the biological and chemical stability of the repeating perfluoroalkyl -(CF2)n- moiety common to all known AFFF-derived PFASs, it is not immediately evident whether the microbial biotransformation mechanisms observed for other organic contaminants also govern the microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances. Herein, we aim to: 1) review the literature on the aerobic or anaerobic microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances in environmental media; 2) compile and summarize proposed microbial biotransformation pathways for major classes of polyfluoroalkyl substances; 3) identify the dominant biotransformation intermediates and terminal biotransformation products; and 4) discuss these findings in the context of environmental monitoring and source allocation. This analysis revealed that much more is currently known about aerobic microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances, as compared to anaerobic biotransformation. Further, there are some similarities in microbial biotransformations of fluorotelomer and electrochemical fluorination-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, but differences may be largely due to head group composition. Dealkylation, oxidation, and hydrolytic reactions appear to be particularly important for microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, and these biotransformations may lead to formation of some semi-stable intermediates. Finally, this review discusses key knowledge gaps and opportunities for further research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Degradation database; Microbial degradation; Pathway; Polyfluorinated substance biotransformation,Chemical stability; Reaction intermediates; Aqueous film forming foams; Degradation database; Microbial biotransformations; Microbial degradation; Organic contaminant; Pathway; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polyfluorinated substance biotransformation; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Potential transformations; Biodegradation; aqueous solution; concentration (composition); microbial activity; oxic conditions; surfactant; biotransformation; dealkylation; environmental monitoring; fluorination; foam; human; hydrolysis; microbial degradation; oxidation; review; systematic review,Elsevier B.V.
Oral exposure to a hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid (HFPO-TA) disrupts mitochondrial function and biogenesis in mice,"Xie X., Zhou J., Hu L., Shu R., Zhang M., Sun L., Wu F., Fu Z., Li Z.",2022,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"Hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid (HFPO-TA) is reported to have hepatotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and cytotoxicity. In this study, the toxicological effects of HFPO-TA on mitochondrial function and biogenesis were studied. Mice were exposed to drinking water which contained either 2, 20, or 200 μg/L HFPO-TA. Results showed exposure to HFPO-TA induced disadvantageous physiological changes in mice, including increases in liver weight, altered cell morphology, and inflammatory responses. Specifically, exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA increased mitochondria number, relative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, and mRNA levels of mitochondrial genes encoded by mtDNA. Significant increases in TFAM mRNA and protein levels were also observed. Liver metabolome analysis also showed exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA further enhanced increases in metabolites and altered metabolic pathways that correlated with mitochondrial function, especially the production of ATP. HFPO-TA exposure increased protein expression of mitochondrial complex I-V, and the activities of key enzymes involved in TCA cycle (α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase). Furthermore, exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA significantly up-regulating mRNA and protein levels of Opa1, Mfn1, Mfn2, Fis1, and Mff, but did not change Drp1. These findings suggest HFPO-TA could have detrimental effects on health of animals, particularly it was associated with disrupted mitochondrial energy metabolism. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid; Metabolome; Mitochondrial biogenesis; Mitochondrial DNA,Biosynthesis; DNA; Mammals; Metabolism; Metabolites; Mitochondria; Physiological models; Potable water; Proteins; Hepatotoxicity; Hexafluoropropylene oxide; Hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid; Metabolomes; Mitochondrial biogenesis; Mitochondrial DNA; Mitochondrial function; mRNA levels; Oral exposure; Protein level; Oligomers; citrate synthase; drinking water; hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid; messenger RNA; mitochondrial complex ii; mitochondrial complex iv; mitochondrial complex v; mitochondrial DNA; oxoglutarate dehydrogenase; propylene oxide; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); succinate dehydrogenase; ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase; unclassified drug; chemical compound; concentration (composition); drinking water; enzyme; enzyme activity; gene expression; metabolism; mitochondrial DNA; rodent; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight; cell structure; citric acid cycle; controlled study; energy metabolism; histopathology; inflammation; liver cell; liver function; liver mitochondrion; liver weight; male; metabolism; metabolome; mitochondrial biogenesis; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrial gene; mitochondrion; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; protein expression; toxicology; upregulation,Elsevier B.V.
"A systematic review of emerging contaminants in the Greater Bay Area (GBA), China: Current baselines, knowledge gaps, and research and management priorities","Cundy A.B., Rowlands F.M., Lu G., Wang W.-X.",2022,Environmental Science and Policy,"Development of the Greater Bay area, China (GBA) has imposed significant pressures on ecosystems within the wider Pearl River Delta (PRD) system, including through inputs of contaminants from the GBA's rapidly expanding urban, industrial and agricultural activities. Here, we assess publication trends, sampling focus, and concentrations observed for a range of emerging contaminants (pharmaceutical and personal care products, pesticides, other endocrine disrupting chemicals, platinum group elements, and microplastics) in the GBA, via a systematic review of papers (n = 407) indexed in Science Direct, SpringerLink and Wiley Online databases. While emerging contaminants form the focus of increasing numbers of publications since 2006, they are understudied compared to more traditionally-measured contaminants (here, DDT and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs). BisphenolA was the most widely studied of the emerging contaminants (n = 41 studies) in the GBA, followed by macrolides (n = 32 studies). While multiple point measurements with high precision and low detection limits have been reported for various emerging contaminants, these have not been integrated for management purposes. A relatively high percentage of studies present data from single deployments (48% of studies, despite strong seasonality in the PRD system), data coverage is variable spatially, and reported contaminant concentrations vary significantly (over one to four orders of magnitude). We assess the currently published knowledge under the Source-Pathway-Receptor contaminant linkage model and use this to identify (a) current research emphasis in relation to assessment of contaminant risk, and (b) key knowledge gaps around sources, pathways and receptors in the GBA system. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Emerging contaminants; Environmental baseline; Pearl River Delta; Pearl River Estuary; Risk management,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; chlorphenotane; chlorpyrifos; diclofenac; estradiol; macrolide; microplastic; perfluoro compound; pesticide; platinum; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrethroid; toxic substance; triclosan; bibliographic database; China; environmental management; human; limit of detection; microplastic pollution; publication; research priority; Review; risk assessment; seasonal variation; systematic review; water contamination",Elsevier Ltd
Pathways of organic micropollutants degradation in atmospheric pressure plasma processing – A review,"Topolovec B., Škoro N., Puаč N., Petrovic M.",2022,Chemosphere,"Concern of toxic compounds and their, potentially more harmful degradation products, present in aquatic environment alarmed scientific community and research on the development of novel technologies for wastewater treatment had become of great interest. Up to this date, many papers pointed out the challenges and limitations of conventional wastewater treatment and of some advanced oxidation processes. Advanced technologies based on the use of non-equilibrium or non-thermal plasma had been recognized as a possible solution for, not only degradation, but for complete removal of recalcitrant organic micropollutants. While previous review papers have been focused on plasma physics and chemistry of different types of discharges for few organic micropollutants, this paper brings comprehensive review of current knowledge on the chemistry and degradation pathways by using different non-thermal plasma types for several micropollutants’ classes, such as pharmaceuticals, perfluorinated compounds, pesticides, phenols and dyes and points out some major research gaps. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Advanced oxidation technologies; Degradation pathways; Non-equilibrium/non-thermal plasma types; Novel wastewater treatment procesess; Organic micropollutants; Removal,Aquatic organisms; Atmospheric pressure; Electric discharges; Reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Advanced oxidations technologies; Atmospheric pressure plasmas; Degradation pathways; Degradation products; Non equilibrium; Non-equilibrium/non-thermal plasma type; Nonthermal plasma; Novel wastewater treatment procesess; Organic micropollutants; Toxic compounds; Degradation; aquatic environment; atmospheric pressure; chemical pollutant; degradation; organic pollutant; oxidation; pollutant removal; wastewater; wastewater treatment,Elsevier Ltd
A comprehensive review on current technologies for removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals from wastewaters,"Azizi D., Arif A., Blair D., Dionne J., Filion Y., Ouarda Y., Pazmino A.G., Pulicharla R., Rilstone V., Tiwari B., Vignale L., Brar S.K., Champagne P., Drogui P., Langlois V.S., Blais J.-F.",2022,Environmental Research,"In the recent years, endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) has received increasing attention due to their significant toxic effects on human beings and wildlife by affecting their endocrine systems. As an important group of emerging pollutant, EDCs have been detected in various aquatic environments, including surface waters, groundwater, wastewater, runoff, and landfill leachates. Their removal from water resources has also been an emerging concern considering growing population as well as reducing access to fresh water resources. EDC removal from wastewaters is highly dependent on physicochemical properties of the given EDCs present in each wastewater types as well as various aquatic environments. Due to chemical, physical and physicochemical diversities in these parameters, variety of technologies consisting of physical, biological, electrochemical, and chemical processes have been developed for their removal. This review highlights that the effectiveness of EDC removal is highly dependent of selecting the appropriate technology; which decision is made upon a full wastewater chemical characterization. This review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective about all the current technologies used for EDCs removal from various aquatic matrices along with rising challenges such as the antimicrobial resistance gene transfer during EDC treatment. © 2021 The Authors",EDCs; Endocrine disruptors; Pollutants removal; Treatment technologies; Wastewater,adsorbent; antibiotic agent; carbon nanotube; endocrine disruptor; aqueous solution; detection method; endocrine disruptor; gene transfer; landfill; physicochemical property; pollutant removal; wastewater; wastewater treatment; activated sludge; adsorption; anaerobic sludge; antibiotic resistance; appropriate technology; Article; chlorination; electrocoagulation; filtration; gene transfer; human; lagoon; membrane technology; microalga; nonhuman; oxidation; ozonation; photocatalysis; physical chemistry; plasma gas; sanitation; static electricity; waste water management; water supply; water treatment,Academic Press Inc.
A review on per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) in microplastic and food-contact materials,"Barhoumi B., Sander S.G., Tolosa I.",2022,Environmental Research,"Plastic, paper and cardboard are widely used as food contact materials (FCMs), due to its numerous favourable characteristics. However, they are usually coated with hazardous substances, such as per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs). PFASs, with its functional properties of oil- and water-repellency, can migrate from FCMs into the food and cause potential risk to human health. There are also increasing concerns about the harm that FCMs can cause to the environment. These concerns include accumulation of non-degradable plastics in the environment, generation of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics, and release of PFASs from FCMs. While many reviews have been conducted on PFASs in the environment, including their occurrence, fate, toxicity, biodegradation, migration in ecosystems and remediation technologies, a systematic review of PFASs in FCMs and MPs is currently lacking. In addition, our knowledge of the PFAS sorption processes on MPs is rather limited, and in particular their desorption processes. Thus, this review aims to (1) review the presence of various classes of PFASs in FCMs and their migration into food, (2) review the PFASs in MPs and summarize the sorption mechanisms, and factors that influence their sorption behaviour on MPs in the aquatic environment, and (3) identify the current research gaps and future research directions to predict the risks associated with the presence and sorption of PFASs in FCMs and MPs. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",FCMs; Microplastics; Migration; PFAAs; Precursors; Sorption,acetic acid; alcohol derivative; carboxylic acid; fluorotelomer alcohol; inorganic compound; microplastic; nanoplastic; organofluorine derivative; organophosphate; perfluoro compound; phosphinic acid derivative; phosphonic acid derivative; polymer; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; biodegradation; chemical substance; desorption; health risk; mortality risk; plastic; risk; risk factor; adsorption; aquatic environment; biodegradation; butter; cereal; classification; dangerous goods; desorption; ecosystem restoration; ecotoxicology; environmental factor; fluorination; food; food packaging; health hazard; hydrophobicity; information retrieval; microplastic pollution; milk; nonhuman; pollution transport; Review; ScienceDirect; search engine; static electricity; Web of Science,Academic Press Inc.
Human exposure pathways to poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from indoor media: A systematic review,"DeLuca N.M., Minucci J.M., Mullikin A., Slover R., Cohen Hubal E.A.",2022,Environment International,"Background: Human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been primarily attributed to contaminated food and drinking water. There is information indicating other sources and pathways of exposure in residential environments, but few studies report relationships between these indoor media and human biomonitoring measurements. Methods: This study adapts existing systematic review tools and methodologies to synthesize evidence for PFAS exposure pathways from indoor environment media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust. Studies were identified using innovative machine learning approaches and pathway-specific search strings to reduce time needed for literature search and screening. The included studies and systematic review were evaluated using tools modified specifically for exposure studies. The systematic review was conducted following a previously published protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) that describes the systematic review methodology used in detail. Results: Only 7 studies were identified that measured the targeted subset of 8 PFAS chemicals in concordant household media (primarily house dust) and participant serum. Data extracted from the included studies were used to calculate exposure intake rates and estimate a percentage of occupant serum concentrations that could be attributed to the indoor exposure pathways. These calculations showed that exposure to PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS from contaminated house dust could account for 13%, 3%, 7%, and 25% of serum concentrations, respectively. Inhalation of PFAS in indoor air could account for less than 4% of serum PFOA concentrations and less than 2% of serum PFOS and PFNA concentrations. A risk of bias was identified due to participant profiles in most of the studies being skewed towards white, female, and higher socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Along with synthesizing evidence for estimated contributions to serum PFAS levels from indoor exposure media, this systematic review also identifies a consistent risk of bias across exposure study populations that should be considered in future studies. It highlights a major research gap and need for studies that measure concordant data from both indoor exposure media and participant serum and the need for continued research on exposure modeling parameters for many PFAS chemicals. © 2022",,,Elsevier Ltd
Non-targeted metabolomics and associations with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure in humans: A scoping review,"Guo P., Furnary T., Vasiliou V., Yan Q., Nyhan K., Jones D.P., Johnson C.H., Liew Z.",2022,Environment International,"Objective: To summarize the application of non-targeted metabolomics in epidemiological studies that assessed metabolite and metabolic pathway alterations associated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure. Recent Findings: Eleven human studies published before April 1st, 2021 were identified through database searches (PubMed, Dimensions, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus), and citation chaining (Citationchaser). The sample sizes of these studies ranged from 40 to 965, involving children and adolescents (n = 3), non-pregnant adults (n = 5), or pregnant women (n = 3). High-resolution liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was the primary analytical platform to measure both PFAS and metabolome. PFAS were measured in either plasma (n = 6) or serum (n = 5), while metabolomic profiles were assessed using plasma (n = 6), serum (n = 4), or urine (n = 1). Four types of PFAS (perfluorooctane sulfonate (n = 11), perfluorooctanoic acid (n = 10), perfluorohexane sulfonate (n = 9), perfluorononanoic acid (n = 5)) and PFAS mixtures (n = 7) were the most studied. We found that alterations to tryptophan metabolism and the urea cycle were most reported PFAS-associated metabolomic signatures. Numerous lipid metabolites were also suggested to be associated with PFAS exposure, especially key metabolites in glycerophospholipid metabolism which is critical for biological membrane functions, and fatty acids and carnitines which are relevant to the energy supply pathway of fatty acid oxidation. Other important metabolome changes reported included the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle regarding energy generation, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism in cellular energy systems. Conclusions: There is growing interest in using non-targeted metabolomics to study the human physiological changes associated with PFAS exposure. Multiple PFAS were reported to be associated with alterations in amino acid and lipid metabolism, but these results are driven by one predominant type of pathway analysis thus require further confirmation. Standardizing research methods and reporting are recommended to facilitate result comparison. Future studies should consider potential differences in study methodology, use of prospective design, and influence from confounding bias and measurement errors. © 2022",Exposome; Metabolomics; Perfluorinated compounds; Persistent organic pollutants; Polyfluoroalkyl substances,,Elsevier Ltd
How to investigate human health effects related to exposure to mixtures of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances: A systematic review of statistical methods,"Rosato I., Zare Jeddi M., Ledda C., Gallo E., Fletcher T., Pitter G., Batzella E., Canova C.",2022,Environmental Research,"Background: Humans are exposed to several per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) daily; however, most previous studies have focused on individual PFAS. Although attention to effects of exposure to mixtures of PFAS has grown in recent years, there is no consensus on the appropriate statistical methods that can be used to assess their combined effect on human health. Objectives: We aim to perform a comprehensive review of the statistical methods used in the existing studies which evaluate the association between exposure to mixtures of PFAS and any adverse human health effect. Methods: The online databases PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched for eligible studies, published during the last ten years (last search performed on April 08, 2021). Covidence software was used by two different reviewers to perform a title/abstract screening, followed by a full text revision of the selected papers. Results: A total of 3640 papers were identified, and after the screening process, 53 papers were included in the current review. Most of the studies were published between 2019 and 2021 and were conducted mainly in North America and Europe; more than half of the studies (28 out of 53) were conducted on mother and child pairs. WQS (Weighted Quantile Sum) Regression and BKMR (Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression) were used in 36 out of 53 papers to model mixtures’ effects. Health outcomes included in the studies are immunotoxicity (n = 8), fetal development (n = 7), neurodevelopment (n = 9), reproductive hormones (n = 6), thyroid hormones (n = 7), outcomes related to metabolic pathways (n = 16). Conclusion: Studies on human exposure to PFAS as complex mixtures and health consequences have substantially increased in the last few years. Based on our findings, we propose that addressing risk from PFAS mixtures will likely require combinations of approaches and implementation of constantly evolving statistical methods. Specific guidelines and tools for quality assessment and publication of mixture observational studies are warranted. © 2021",Chemical mixtures; Environmental exposure; Human health; Joint effect; per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),alkyl group; environmental chemical; perfluoroalkanoic acid; sex hormone; thyroid hormone; chemical substance; health impact; literature review; pollution exposure; public health; statistical analysis; adolescent; adult; aged; Bayes theorem; child; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; clinical outcome; controlled study; environmental exposure; Europe; female; fetus development; health hazard; homeostasis; hormone metabolism; human; immunotoxicity; k means clustering; least square analysis; male; nerve cell differentiation; nervous system development; North America; outcome assessment; population exposure; Review; risk assessment; structural equation modeling; systematic review; thyroid gland; Europe; North America,Academic Press Inc.
"Municipal solid waste management: Dynamics, risk assessment, ecological influence, advancements, constraints and perspectives","Vyas S., Prajapati P., Shah A.V., Varjani S.",2022,Science of the Total Environment,"Global energy consumption has been increasing in tandem with economic growth, putting pressure on the world's supply of renewable energy sources.

Transcriptome analysis of 3D primary mouse liver spheroids shows that long-term exposure to hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid disrupts hepatic bile acid metabolism,"Sun S., Wang J., Yao J., Guo H., Dai J.",2022,Science of the Total Environment,"Hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid (HFPO-TA), an alternative to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), has been detected in various environmental and human matrices. However, information regarding its toxicity remains limited. Here, we established a three-dimensional (3D) primary mouse liver spheroid model to compare the hepatotoxicity of HFPO-TA and PFOA. The 3D spheroids were repeatedly exposed to 25-, 50-, or 100-μM HFPO-TA and PFOA for 28 d. Compared with the PFOA groups, the HFPO-TA groups showed higher bioaccumulation potential, higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, and lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP), albumin, and urea secretion. Transcriptome analysis identified 1603 and 772 differentially expressed genes in the 100-μM HFPO-TA- and PFOA-treated groups, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that cholesterol metabolism, bile acid metabolism, and inflammatory response were significantly altered. Exposure to 100-μM HFPO-TA increased triglyceride content but decreased total cholesterol content, while no changes were observed in the 100-μM PFOA-treated group. Total bile acids in the re-polarized 3D spheroids increased significantly after 100-μM HFPO-TA and PFOA treatment, which did not affect bile acid synthesis but inhibited the expression levels of Bsep and Mrp2 related to bile acid transport. Thus, HFPO-TA exhibited more serious hepatotoxicity than PFOA in 3D primary liver spheroids and may not be a safe alternative. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",3D spheroids; Bile acid transport; Hepatotoxicity; HFPO-TA; Transcriptome analysis,Adenosinetriphosphate; Biochemistry; Cholesterol; Metabolism; Urea; 3d spheroid; Acid transport; Bile acid; Bile acid transport; Hepatotoxicity; Hexafluoropropylene oxide; Hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid; Mice liver; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Transcriptome analysis; Oligomers; adenosine triphosphate; albumin; chemical compound; F actin; hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid; lactate dehydrogenase; transcriptome; unclassified drug; urea; bile acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; oxide; bioinformatics; biological analysis; metabolism; organic acid; pollution exposure; toxicity; animal cell; Article; Bagg albino mouse; bile acid metabolism; bile acid synthesis; bioaccumulation; cholesterol metabolism; concentration (parameter); controlled study; immunocytochemistry; liver cell; long term exposure; male; mouse; nonhuman; real time polymerase chain reaction; spheroid cell; animal; gene expression profiling; liver; Animals; Bile Acids and Salts; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Gene Expression Profiling; Liver; Mice; Oxides,Elsevier B.V.
Activated carbon versus metal-organic frameworks: A review of their PFAS adsorption performance,"Pauletto P.S., Bandosz T.J.",2022,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of fluorinated aliphatic compounds considered as emerging persistent pollutants. Owing to their adverse effects on human health and environment, efficient methods of their removal from various complex matrices need to be developed. This review focuses on recent results addressing the adsorption of PFAS on activated carbons (AC) and metal-organic frameworks (MOF). While the former are well-established adsorbents used in water treatment, the latter are relatively new and still not applied at a large scale. Nevertheless, they attract research interests owing to their developed porosity and versatile surface chemistry. While AC provide high volumes of pores and hydrophobic surfaces to strongly attract fluorinated chains, MOF supply sites for acid-base complexation and a variety of specific interactions. The modifications of AC are focused on the introduction of basicity to attract PFAS anions via electrostatic/chemical interactions, and those of MOF - on structural defects to increase the pore sizes. Based on the comparison of the performance and specifically adsorption forces provided by these two groups of materials, activated carbons were pointed out as worthy of further research efforts. This is because their surface, especially that in large pores, where dispersive forces are week and where extensive pore space might be utilized to adsorb more PFAS, can be further chemically modified and these modifications might be informed by the mechanisms of PFAS adsorption, which are specific for MOF. This review emphasizes the effects of these modifications on the adsorption mechanism and brings the critical assessment of the advantages/disadvantages of both groups as PFAS adsorbents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Activated carbons; Adsorption; MOF; Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS); Porosity; Surface chemistry,"charcoal; fluorocarbon; metal organic framework; adsorption; human; water pollutant; Adsorption; Charcoal; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier B.V.
The Association between ADHD and Environmental Chemicals—A Scoping Review,"Moore S., Paalanen L., Melymuk L., Katsonouri A., Kolossa-Gehring M., Tolonen H.",2022,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"The role of environmental chemicals in the etiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been of interest in recent research. This scoping review aims to summarize known or possible associations between ADHD and environmental exposures to substances selected as priority chemicals of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU). Literature searches were performed in PubMed to identify relevant publications. Only meta-analyses and review articles were included, as they provide more extensive evidence compared to individual studies. The collected evidence indicated that lead (Pb), phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) are moderately to highly associated with ADHD. Limited evidence exists for an association between ADHD and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), flame retardants, mercury (Hg), and pesticides. The evidence of association between ADHD and cadmium (Cd) and per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) based on the identified reviews was low but justified further research. The methods of the individual studies included in the reviews and meta-analyses covered in the current paper varied considerably. Making precise conclusions in terms of the strength of evidence on association between certain chemicals and ADHD was not straightforward. More research is needed for stronger evidence of associations or the lack of an association between specific chemical exposures and ADHD. © 2022 by the authors.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances target and alter human prostate stem-progenitor cells,"Hu W.-Y., Lu R., Hu D.P., Imir O.B., Zuo Q., Moline D., Afradiasbagharani P., Liu L., Lowe S., Birch L., Griend D.J.V., Madak-Erdogan Z., Prins G.S.",2022,Biochemical Pharmacology,"Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are a large family of widely used synthetic chemicals that are environmentally and biologically persistent and present in most individuals. Chronic PFAS exposure have been linked to increased prostate cancer risk in occupational settings, however, underlying mechanisms have not been interrogated. Herein we examined exposure of normal human prostate stem-progenitor cells (SPCs) to 10 nM PFOA or PFOS using serial passage of prostasphere cultures. Exposure to either PFAS for 3–4 weeks increased spheroid numbers and size indicative of elevated stem cell self-renewal and progenitor cell proliferation. Transcriptome analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) showed 1) SPC expression of PPARs and RXRs able to mediate PFAS effects, 2) the emergence of a new cell cluster of aberrantly differentiated luminal progenitor cells upon PFOS/PFOA exposure, and 3) enrichment of cancer-associated signaling pathways. Metabolomic analysis of PFAS-exposed prostaspheres revealed increased glycolytic pathways including the Warburg effect as well as strong enrichment of serine and glycine metabolism which may promote a pre-malignant SPC fate. Finally, growth of in vivo xenografts of tumorigenic RWPE-2 human prostate cells, shown to contain cancer stem-like cells, was markedly enhanced by daily PFOS feeding to nude mice hosts. Together, these findings are the first to identify human prostate SPCs as direct PFAS targets with resultant reprogrammed transcriptomes and metabolomes that augment a preneoplastic state and may contribute to an elevated prostate cancer risk with chronic exposures. © 2021",PFAS; PFOA; PFOS; Progenitor cell; Prostate; Stem cell,,Elsevier Inc.
Association between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus,"Wang J., Zhang J., Fan Y., Li Z., Tao C., Yan W., Niu R., Huang Y., Xu Q., Wang X., Xu Q., Han L., Lu C.",2022,International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health,"Background: Existing evidence suggests that perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exposure might contribute to the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis to identify the association between PFAS and the risk of GDM. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for appropriate articles about the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of GDM before September 28, 2020. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized by Stata 16.0 through fixed effect models according to heterogeneity. We also carried out subgroup analyses by geographic location, blood sampling time of subjects, method of chemical analysis, study design, sample size, and sampling year. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the robustness of the results. Results: A total of eight studies involving 5654 pregnant women were included in the meta-analysis. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was positively and significantly associated with the risk of GDM (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02–1.59). Exposure to other types of PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of GDM with the pooled effect estimates of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86–1.09), 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86–1.24), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55–1.16) respectively. Conclusion: We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and GDM and found that PFOA concentration was significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of GDM in public health. Further studies are needed in order to establish causality and clarify the potential mechanism. © 2021",Gestational diabetes mellitus; Meta-analysis; Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances,,Elsevier GmbH

According to the heterogeneity of the included studies, fixed-effects (I2 ≤ 50%) and random-effects (I2 &gt; 50%) models were applied respectively. The significant associations between PFOS and PTB (pooled OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.20–1.98), PFOA and miscarriage (pooled OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.15–1.70), and PFOS and LBW (pooled OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.19–1.94) were obtained. There were differences between included studies with different study regions, sampling time, and samples type used for PFASs assessment. These findings may provide insight in risk assessment and decision-making in producing products that contain PFASs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Birth outcomes; Meta-analysis; Perfluoroalkyl substances,"Decision making; Random processes; % reductions; Birth outcome; Birth weight; Confidence interval; Gestational age; Low birth weights; Meta-analysis; Odd ratios; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Web of Science; Risk assessment; birth rate; heterogeneity; meta-analysis; risk assessment; sampling; Review; adverse event; birth weight; female; human; low birth weight; maternal exposure; meta analysis; newborn; pollutant; pregnancy; prematurity; toxicity; fluorocarbon; Birth Weight; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Exposure; Pregnancy; Premature Birth",Elsevier Ltd
Engineered biochar: A way forward to environmental remediation,"Monga D., Shetti N.P., Basu S., Raghava Reddy K., Badawi M., Bonilla-Petriciolet A., Aminabhavi T.M.",2022,Fuel,"The accelerated urbanization and industrialization worldwide has increased the pollution via toxic chemicals, thus generating environmental hazards to public health and ecosystems. As a consequence, the national authorities and scientists are paying more attention to the development and implementation of viable cost-effective detoxification solutions. Biochar has emerged as a biomass-derived material that can be produced through a variety of feedstocks and carbonization techniques. Distinct characteristics of biochar can be appropriate, cost-effective, and eco-friendly for removing a wide spectrum of inorganic and organic pollutants. This review aims to emphasize the crucial function of biochar-based materials in the abatement of toxic emerging pollutants. It covers the synthesis and applications of engineered biochars by discussing extensive research and knowledge in this area. The relationships of biochar properties with feedstock, synthesis conditions, technologies and modification methods have also been discussed. Biochars with different surface functionalities (e.g., COO−, Fe-O, etc.,) can be obtained by either varying the feedstock material (lignocellulosic or non-lignocellulosic) or by modifying it with different chemicals (e.g., metal ions, rare earth elements, surfactants) including the preparation of composites. The interaction mechanisms between biochar and various pollutants are reviewed and analyzed. The type of interactions (e.g., electrostatic, π-π stacking, hydrogen bonding) depends on the different surface functionalities of biochar. This review also illustrates that biochar and its related composites have shown remarkable properties and versatility for their effective application in adsorption, photocatalysis and oxidation processes in aqueous phase. Finally, prospective research directions and opportunity areas for biochar research are also discussed.

"The environmental distribution and removal of emerging pollutants, highlighting the importance of using microbes as a potential degrader: A review","Ahmad H.A., Ahmad S., Cui Q., Wang Z., Wei H., Chen X., Ni S.-Q., Ismail S., Awad H.M., Tawfik A.",2022,Science of the Total Environment,"Emerging pollutants (EPs) create a worldwide concern owing to their low concentration and severe toxicity to the receptors. The prominent emerging pollutants categories as pharmaceutical and personal care product, plasticizer, surfactants, and persistent organic pollutants. Typically, EPs are widely disseminated in the aquatic ecosystem and capable of perturbing the physiology of water bodies as well as humans. The primary sources of EPs in the environment include anthropogenic release, atmospheric deposition, untreated or substandard treated wastewater, and extreme weather events. Intensive research has been done covering the environmental distribution, ecological disturbance, fate, and removal of EPs in the past decades. However, a systematic review on the distribution of EPs in the engineered and natural aquatic environment and the degradation of different EPs by using anaerobic sludge, aerobic bacteria, and isolated strains are limited. This review article aims to highlight the importance, application, and future perceptions of using different microbes to degrade EPs. Overall, this review article illustrates the superiority of using non-cultivable and cultivable microbes to degrade the EPs as an eco-friendly approach. Practically, the outcomes of this review paper will build up the knowledge base solutions to remove EPs from the wastewater. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Aerobic sludge; Anaerobic sludge; Degradation; Emerging pollutants; Environmental distribution; Genetically modified bacteria,"Aerobic bacteria; Aquatic ecosystems; Biodegradation; Degradation; Knowledge based systems; Meteorological problems; Wastewater treatment; Aerobic sludge; Anaerobic sludge; Anthropogenics; Atmospheric depositions; Emerging pollutants; Environmental distribution; Genetically modified bacteria; Low concentrations; Pharmaceutical and personal care products; Primary sources; Organic pollutants; aquatic environment; biodegradation; genetically modified organism; microbial community; perception; persistent organic pollutant; pollutant removal; sludge; spatial distribution; aerobic bacterium; aerobic sludge; anaerobic sludge; aquatic environment; atmospheric deposition; extreme weather; human; knowledge base; microorganism; nonhuman; perception; review; systematic review; wastewater; ecosystem; pollutant; sewage; water pollutant; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Sewage; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier B.V.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in water and wastewater: A critical review of their global occurrence and distribution,"Kurwadkar S., Dane J., Kanel S.R., Nadagouda M.N., Cawdrey R.W., Ambade B., Struckhoff G.C., Wilkin R.",2022,Science of the Total Environment,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of fluorinated organic compounds of anthropogenic origin. Due to their unique chemical properties, widespread production, environmental distribution, long-term persistence, bioaccumulative potential, and associated risks for human health, PFAS have been classified as persistent organic pollutants of significant concern. Scientific evidence from the last several decades suggests that their widespread occurrence in the environment correlates with adverse effects on human health and ecology. The presence of PFAS in the aquatic environment demonstrates a close link between the anthroposphere and the hydrological cycle, and concentrations of PFAS in surface and groundwater range in value along the ng L−1–μg L−1 scale. Here, we critically reviewed the research published in the last decade on the global occurrence and distribution of PFAS in the aquatic environment. Ours is the first paper to critically evaluate the occurrence of PFAS at the continental scale and the evolving global regulatory responses to manage and mitigate the adverse human health risks posed by PFAS. The review reports that PFAS are widespread despite being phased out—they have been detected in different continents irrespective of the level of industrial development. Their occurrence far from the potential sources suggests that long-range atmospheric transport is an important pathway of PFAS distribution. Recently, several studies have investigated the health impacts of PFAS exposure—they have been detected in biota, drinking water, food, air, and human serum. In response to the emerging information about PFAS toxicity, several countries have provided administrative guidelines for PFAS in water, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Germany, and Australia. In the US, additional regulatory measures are under consideration. Further, many PFAS have now been listed as persistent organic pollutants. This comprehensive review provides crucial baseline information on the global occurrence, distribution, and regulatory framework of PFAS. © 2021",Environmental pollution; Perfluoroalkyl substances; PFAS; PFOA; PFOS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances,"Atmospheric movements; Groundwater; Health; Health risks; Potable water; Aquatic environments; Environmental pollutions; Global regulatories; Human health; Occurrence and distribution; Perfluoroalkyl substances; PFOA; PFOS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Organic pollutants; alkanesulfonic acid; drinking water; fluorocarbon; human; wastewater; water pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Drinking Water; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier B.V.
PFAS fate and destruction mechanisms during thermal treatment: a comprehensive review,"Longendyke G.K., Katel S., Wang Y.",2022,Environmental science. Processes & impacts,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent chemicals and have been detected throughout the environment. Thermal treatment is the most common remediation approach for PFAS-contaminated solid wastes. Although various thermal treatment techniques have demonstrated the potential to destruct PFAS, the fate of PFAS, removal efficacy, potential emissions, and the formation of incomplete combustion products during thermal treatment are little known. This study provides a critical review on the behavior of PFAS based on different types of thermal treatment technologies with various PFAS-impacted environmental medias that include water, soil, sewage sludge, pure PFAS materials, and other PFAS-containing wastes. Different extents of PFAS thermal destruction are observed across various thermal treatment techniques and operating conditions. PFAS removal and destruction efficiencies rely heavily on PFAS structures, the complex combustion chemistry, the presence or absence of oxygen, temperature, and other operational conditions. This review also covers proposed PFAS thermal destruction mechanisms. Different thermal destruction mechanisms for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and other PFAS are reviewed and compared. The majority of studies about PFAS thermal destruction mechanisms were focused on a specific list of PFAS and based mostly on the pyrolysis treatment. The basic pathway for PFAS destruction during pyrolysis is hydrodefluorination, which could be largely influenced by the alkaline condition. Future field-scale research that involves the characterization of PFAS destruction products and incomplete combustion products is needed to address public concerns and better emission control.",,,NLM (Medline)
Recent advances in attached growth membrane bioreactor systems for wastewater treatment,"Deng L., Guo W., Ngo H.H., Zhang X., Chen C., Chen Z., Cheng D., Ni S.-Q., Wang Q.",2022,Science of the Total Environment,"To tackle membrane fouling and limited removals of pollutants (nutrients and emerging pollutants) that hinder the wide applications of membrane bioreactor (MBR), attached growth MBR (AGMBR) combining MBR and attached growth process has been developed. This review comprehensively presents the up-to-date developments of media used in both aerobic and anaerobic AGMBRs for treating wastewaters containing conventional and emerging pollutants. It also elaborates the properties of different media, characteristics of attached biomass, and their contributions to AGMBR performance. Conventional media, such as biological activated carbon and polymeric carriers, induce formation of aerobic, anoxic and/or anaerobic microenvironment, increase specific surface area or porous space for biomass retention, improve microbial activities, and enrich diverse microorganisms, thereby enhancing pollutants removal. Meanwhile, new media (i.e. biochar, bioaugmented carriers with selected strain/mixed cultures) do not only eliminate conventional pollutants (i.e. high concentration of nitrogen, etc.), but also effectively remove emerging pollutants (i.e. micropollutants, nonylphenol, adsorbable organic halogens, etc.) by forming thick and dense biofilm, creating anoxic/anaerobic microenvironments inside the media, enriching special functional microorganisms and increasing activity of microorganisms. Additionally, media can improve sludge characteristics (i.e. less extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products, larger floc size, better sludge settleability, etc.), alleviating membrane fouling. Future studies need to focus on the development and applications of more new functional media in removing wider spectrum of emerging pollutants and enhancing biogas generation, as well as scale-up of lab-scale AGMBRs to pilot or full-scale AGMBRs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Attached growth; Carriers; Emerging pollutants; Media; Membrane bioreactor; Wastewater treatment,"Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Bioconversion; Bioreactors; Membrane fouling; Membranes; Microorganisms; Pollution; Reclamation; Anaerobics; Attached growth; Carrier; Emerging pollutants; Growth process; Medium; Membrane bioreactor system; Microenvironments; Nutrient pollutants; Property; Wastewater treatment; activated carbon; biogas; polymer; bioreactor; fouling; persistent organic pollutant; pollutant removal; wastewater treatment; aerobic bacterium; anaerobic bacterium; biofouling; biomass; concentration (parameter); nonhuman; particle size; physical chemistry; physical parameters; quorum quenching; Review; waste component removal; waste water management; artificial membrane; bioreactor; sewage; wastewater; water management; Bioreactors; Membranes, Artificial; Sewage; Waste Water; Water Purification",Elsevier B.V.
Pollution Characteristics and Driving Factors of Antibiotic Resistance Genes in Dexing Copper Mine [德兴铜矿区抗生素抗性基因污染特征及其驱动因子],"Han L., Lou Q., Qiao M., Liu M.-T., Zhong J.-Y., Ding H.-J.",2022,Huanjing Kexue/Environmental Science,"Environmental antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are a type of emerging pollutant that has been widely concerning. However, investigations into the contamination of ARGs in mining areas have been scarce. Here, the types, abundances, and influencing factors of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were investigated in soil/sediment of the Dexing copper mine area in June 2019 by using high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (HT-qPCR). Furthermore, the influence of heavy metals and MGEs factors on ARGs was studied using the multivariate statistical analysis method. The results showed that there were a variety of ARGs in the Dexing copper mining area, and the maximum detected number of ARGs was 70. At the relative abundance level, the relative abundance of individual sites reached 0.085. In the Dexing copper mine, multidrug, MLSB, β-lactamases, tetracycline, and aminoglycoside resistance genes were the dominant ARG classes based on their numbers. The efflux pump was the most dominant resistance mechanism, followed by antibiotic deactivation and cellular protection. There was a significant positive correlation between the abundance of ARGs and MGEs (P<0.05), and TnpA04 and Inti1 were the most important MEGs in Dexing copper mine samples, indicating that horizontal gene transfer might be an important mechanism for the spread of environmental ARGs. The results of Pearson correlation analysis and RDA analysis showed that the content of Cu was significantly positively correlated with the detected numbers and abundance of ARGs (P<0.05), suggesting that the high content of Cu in the Dexing copper mining area might be an important driving factor for the formation of ARGs. © 2022, Science Press.

Low-dose perfluorooctanoic acid stimulates steroid hormone synthesis in Leydig cells: Integrated proteomics and metabolomics evidence,"Huang Q., Luo L., Han X., Li F., Zhang X., Tian M.",2022,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), one of the well-known perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), has been widespread in the environment and associated with male reproductive toxicity. However, the molecular mechanism involved in low-level PFOA-induced male endocrine disruption remains to be elucidated. In this study, we performed a combined proteomics and metabolomics analysis to investigate the proteomic and metabolic alterations in MLTC-1 Leydig cells responsive to low levels of PFOA exposure. The results showed that PFOA significantly regulated the expressions of 67 proteins and 17 metabolites, among which 18 proteins and 7 metabolites were specifically tied to lipid and fatty acid metabolism as well as testicular steroidogenesis. It is further suggested that low-dose PFOA stimulates steroid hormone synthesis by accelerating fatty acid metabolism and steroidogenic process, which is involved in the repression of p38 and cAMP-dependent ERK signaling pathway. The animal studies also revealed that environmentally relevant levels of PFOA increased serum steroid hormone levels accompanied by the activated cAMP and inhibited p38/ERK pathway in testis, which confirmed our in vitro findings. Overall, the present study will provide novel insights into the toxicological mechanisms of low-level PFOA-mediated steroidogenic disturbance, and may implicate the reproductive health risk of humans with environmental PFOA exposure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Low-dose exposure; Metabolomics; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Proteomics; Steroidogenic stimulation,Cells; Fatty acids; Health risks; Metabolites; Molecular biology; Proteins; Fatty acid metabolism; Leydig cells; Low dose; Low-dose exposures; Metabolomics; Molecular mechanism; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Reproductive toxicities; Steroidogenic stimulation; Metabolism; fluorocarbon; hormone; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; steroid; animal; human; Leydig cell; male; metabolomics; proteomics; Animals; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Hormones; Humans; Leydig Cells; Male; Metabolomics; Proteomics; Steroids,Elsevier B.V.
A sensitive environmental forensic method that determines bisphenol S and A exposure within receipt-handling through fingerprint analysis,"Jang M., Yang H., Lee H., Lee K.S., Oh J.Y., Jeon H., Ok Y.S., Hwang S.Y., Park J., Oh D.X.",2022,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"As human beings have been consistently exposed to bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol S (BPS) derived from various products, the intake of BPS/BPA to humans has been extensively studied. However, using conventional biological matrices such as urine, blood, or dissected skin to detect BPS/BPA in the human body system requires longer exposure time to them, hardly defines the pollutant source of the accumulated BPS/BPA, and is often invasive. Herein, our new approach i.e. fingerprint analysis quantitatively confirms the transfer of BPS/BPA from receipts (specific pollution source) to human skin only within receipt-handling of “20 s”. When receipts (fingertip region size; ~1 cm2) containing 100–300 μg of BPS or BPA are handled, 20–40 μg fingerprint-1 of BPS or BPA is transferred to human skin (fingertip). This transferred amount of BPS/BPA can still be toxic according to the toxicity test using water fleas. As a visual evidence, a fingerprint map that matches the distribution of the absorbed BPS/BPA is developed using a mass spectrometry imaging tool. This is the first study to analyze fingerprints to determine the incorporation mechanism of emerging pollutants. This study provides an efficient and non-invasive environmental forensic tool to analyze amounts and sources of hazardous substances. © 2021 The Authors",Bisphenol derivatives; Emerging contaminants; Environmental forensics; Fingerprints; Toxicity test of water flea,"Forensic science; Mass spectrometry; Pollution; Toxicity; Bisphenol A; Bisphenol derivatives; Bisphenols; Bisphenols-A; Emerging contaminant; Environmental forensics; Fingerprint; Toxicity test; Toxicity test of water flea; Water flea; Phenols; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; bisphenol s; phenol derivative; unclassified drug; benzhydryl derivative; bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone; phenol derivative; sulfone; environmental factor; forensic science; phenol; pollutant source; toxicity test; Article; Cladocera; dangerous goods; environmental exposure; environmental forensics; finger dermatoglyphics; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human tissue; mass spectrometry; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; toxicity testing; paper; skin; skin absorption; Cladocera; Benzhydryl Compounds; Humans; Paper; Phenols; Skin; Skin Absorption; Sulfones",Elsevier B.V.
Advances in the management of cardioembolic stroke associated with patent foramen ovale,"Grory B.M., Magnus Ohman E., Feng W., Xian Y., Yaghi S., Kamel H., Reznik M.E.",2022,The BMJ,"Patent foramen ovale (PFO) describes a valve in the interatrial septum that permits shunting of blood or thrombotic material between the atria. PFOs are present in approximately 25% of the healthy population and are not associated with any pathology in the vast majority of cases. However, comparisons between patients with stroke and healthy controls suggest that PFOs may be causative of stroke in certain patients whose stroke is otherwise cryptogenic. Options for the diagnosis of PFO include transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. PFOs associated with an interatrial septal aneurysm seem to be more strongly linked to risk of recurrent stroke. Therapeutic options for secondary stroke prevention in the setting of a PFO include antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and percutaneous device closure. Recent randomized clinical trials suggest that percutaneous closure reduces the subsequent risk of stroke in appropriately selected patients, with a large relative benefit but small absolute benefit. Referral for percutaneous PFO closure should therefore be considered in certain patients after a multidisciplinary, patient centered discussion. Areas for future study include structural biomarkers to aid in determining the role of PFO closure in older people with possible PFO associated stroke, the role of direct oral anticoagulants, and very long term outcomes after device closure. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Cell-Cell Interaction-Mediated Signaling in the Testis Induces Reproductive Dysfunction—Lesson from the Toxicant/ Pharmaceutical Models,"Wang L., Bu T., Wu X., Gao S., Li X., De Jesus A.B., Wong C.K.C., Chen H., Chung N.P.Y., Sun F., Yan Cheng C.",2022,Cells,"Emerging evidence has shown that cell-cell interactions between testicular cells, in par-ticular at the Sertoli cell-cell and Sertoli-germ cell interface, are crucial to support spermatogenesis. The unique ultrastructures that support cell-cell interactions in the testis are the basal ES (ectoplas-mic specialization) and the apical ES. The basal ES is found between adjacent Sertoli cells near the basement membrane that also constitute the blood-testis barrier (BTB). The apical ES is restrictively expressed at the Sertoli-spermatid contact site in the apical (adluminal) compartment of the sem-iniferous epithelium. These ultrastructures are present in both rodent and human testes, but the majority of studies found in the literature were done in rodent testes. As such, our discussion herein, unless otherwise specified, is focused on studies in testes of adult rats. Studies have shown that the testicular cell-cell interactions crucial to support spermatogenesis are mediated through distinctive signaling proteins and pathways, most notably involving FAK, Akt1/2 and Cdc42 GTPase. Thus, manipulation of some of these signaling proteins, such as FAK, through the use of phosphomimetic mutants for overexpression in Sertoli cell epithelium in vitro or in the testis in vivo, making FAK either constitutively active or inactive, we can modify the outcome of spermatogenesis. For instance, using the toxicant-induced Sertoli cell or testis injury in rats as study models, we can either block or rescue toxicant-induced infertility through overexpression of p-FAK-Y397 or p-FAK-Y407 (and their mutants), including the use of specific activator(s) of the involved signaling proteins against pAkt1/2. These findings thus illustrate that a potential therapeutic approach can be developed to manage toxicant-induced male reproductive dysfunction. In this review, we critically evaluate these recent findings, highlighting the direction for future investigations by bringing the laboratory-based research through a translation path to clinical investigations. © 2022 by the authors.

Impact of Contaminants on Microbiota: Linking the Gut–Brain Axis with Neurotoxicity,"Balaguer-Trias J., Deepika D., Schuhmacher M., Kumar V.",2022,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Over the last years, research has focused on microbiota to establish a missing link between neuronal health and intestine imbalance. Many studies have considered microbiota as critical regulators of the gut–brain axis. The crosstalk between microbiota and the central nervous system is mainly explained through three different pathways: the neural, endocrine, and immune pathways, intricately interconnected with each other. In day-to-day life, human beings are exposed to a wide variety of contaminants that affect our intestinal microbiota and alter the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, causing neuronal disorders. The interplay between xenobiotics, microbiota and neurotoxicity is still not fully explored, especially for susceptible populations such as pregnant women, neonates, and developing children. Precisely, early exposure to contaminants can trigger neurodevelopmental toxicity and long-term diseases. There is growing but limited research on the specific mechanisms of the microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA), making it challenging to understand the effect of environmental pollutants. In this review, we discuss the biological interplay between microbiota–gut–brain and analyse the role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals: Bisphenol A (BPA), Chlorpyrifos (CPF), Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in MGBA perturbations and subsequent neurotoxicity. The complexity of the MGBA and the changing nature of the gut microbiota pose significant challenges for future research. However, emerging in-silico models able to analyse and interpret meta-omics data are a promising option for understanding the processes in this axis and can help prevent neurotoxicity. © 2022 by the authors.

Prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and thyroid function in neonates: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Sun M., Cao X., Wu Y., Shen L., Wei G.",2022,Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Thyroid hormone homeostasis is essential for normal brain development in fetuses and infants. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to organochlorine (β coefficient, −0.022; 95% CI, −0.04 to −0.003) and PFAS (β coefficient, −0.017; 95% CI, −0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to organochlorine and PFAS may be associated with lower neonatal TT4 level. © 2022 The Authors",Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Maternal exposure; Neonates; Thyroid hormones,"4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; endocrine disruptor; flame retardant; liothyronine; metal; organochlorine derivative; organofluorine derivative; organophosphate; phenol; phthalic acid; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polyfluoroalkyl substance; thyrotropin; thyroxine; unclassified drug; thyroid hormone; Article; ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; human; meta analysis; newborn period; prenatal exposure; risk assessment; risk factor; systematic review; thyroid function; adverse event; female; infant; maternal exposure; newborn; pregnancy; thyroid gland; Endocrine Disruptors; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Exposure; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Thyroid Gland; Thyroid Hormones",Academic Press
Promising adsorptive materials derived from agricultural and industrial wastes for antibiotic removal: A comprehensive review,Juela D.M.,2022,Separation and Purification Technology,"The development of novel materials and their application as adsorbents to improve water quality is one of the branches of materials science that has advanced significantly in the last decade. Due to the contamination of water resources with antibiotic residues, and the concern to contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance, scientists have tapped into agricultural and industrial wastes in order to transform them into new functional adsorbents that allow the adsorption of these pollutants. This review aims to summarize the different types of adsorptive materials that can be prepared using these residues and their application for removing antibiotics. From the reviewed literature, the adsorbents were classified as raw materials, surface-modified adsorbents, waste-based composites, carbon-based materials, and other adsorbents like zeolite, nano-hydroxyapatite, nano-cellulase, nano-silica, among others. Biochar and hydrochar are two of the most studied carbonaceous materials, with adsorption capacities ranging from 10 to 944 mg/g. Other leading adsorbents from the same family include mesoporous carbons, hierarchical and heteroatoms-doped porous carbons, and bio graphene, with surface area and adsorption performance over 1000 m2/g and 500 mg/g, respectively. The most outstanding material prepared from waste was zeolite analcime, produced from electrolytic manganese residue, removing 1922 mg/g for roxithromycin. In addition, new methodologies or combined methods to produce these adsorbents, including new modifier agents (ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents), templating, self-templating, doping techniques, and thermo-chemical approaches were reviewed for the first time. Furthermore, particular emphasis was given to photocatalyst-loaded adsorbents due to their synergistic effect of adsorption and degradation of antibiotics. Finally, novel methodologies to regenerate saturated adsorbents were discussed, such as UV radiation-assisted regeneration and ultrasound. © 2021",Adsorption; Antibacterial removal; Biosorbent; Emerging pollutants; Photocatalysis; Porous materials; Residues,Adsorbents; Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Antibiotics; Hydroxyapatite; Ionic liquids; Mesoporous materials; Nanocomposites; Silica; Water pollution; Water quality; Zeolites; Adsorptive materials; Antibacterial removal; Antibacterials; Antibiotic removal; Biosorbents; Emerging pollutants; Material science; Novel materials; Residue; Waters resources; Adsorption,Elsevier B.V.
Assessment of styrene-divinylbenzene polymer (PPL) solid-phase extraction and non-targeted tandem mass spectrometry for the analysis of xenobiotics in seawater,"Cancelada L., Torres R.R., Garrafa Luna J., Dorrestein P.C., Aluwihare L.I., Prather K.A., Petras D.",2022,Limnology and Oceanography: Methods,"Anthropogenic imprints have become a fundamental part of most ecosystems. Our chemical footprint is often detected using targeted approaches, whereas xenobiotics are embedded within the large pool of dissolved metabolites, altered by biotic and abiotic mechanisms. Thus, it is necessary to simultaneously study anthropogenic signals entwined with the variety of organic signatures that exist in aquatic environments. However, methods for non-targeted analysis of natural metabolites are not always well suited for the analysis of pollutants. Here, we report the reassessment of styrene-divinylbenzene polymer-based Priority PolLutant (PPL) solid-phase extraction (PPL-SPE), which is typically used to extract marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) for biogeochemical studies, to analyze a set of xenobiotics commonly observed in coastal North Pacific seawater. After PPL extraction and analysis by nontargeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), we successfully detected 23 out of 25 selected pharmaceuticals, personal care products, biocides, perfluorocarbons, and polymer additives in a complex marine DOM sample using positive and negative electrospray ionization. We tested two pH conditions to mimic typical marine DOM extraction studies and found mean recovery rates of xenobiotics were approximately 10% higher in seawater pH (pH ~ 8) than in acidified samples (pH ~ 2) for both negative and positive modes, although overall, mean recovery rates were 10% lower in negative mode. Our results indicate that PPL-SPE in combination with non-targeted LC–MS/MS is capable of capturing the tested set of xenobiotics, thus allowing the repurposing of biogeochemical sampling strategies as well as existing DOM samples and MS data for the subsequent assessment of anthropogenic impacts in marine environments. © 2021 The Authors.

Detection and treatment strategies of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS): Fate of PFAS through DPSIR framework analysis,"John J., Coulon F., Chellam P.V.",2022,Journal of Water Process Engineering,"Per/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), regarded as “forever chemicals”, are a class of emerging contaminants occurring worldwide that pose many serious environmental issues to water quality and human health. The presence of strong carbon‑fluorine bonds in their backbone and their physicochemical properties offer them resistance and restrict them from breaking down into simple compounds in the environment. There are many challenges to be addressed in the detection and removal from the environment. In this comprehensive review, a Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework has been proposed to understand PFAS from the source of emission and their impacts on the environment. We reviewed the various detection methodologies for monitoring PFAS levels and analytical techniques for their quantification to know their environmental levels. The challenges and scope of various treatment technologies developed and implemented have also been critically discussed. The future perspectives of PFAS, including their source reduction and framing regulatory policies and the challenges faced when moving towards a sustainable future, are focused. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",DPSIR framework; Optimization; PFAS; Regulatory standards; Sensors; Treatment technologies,,Elsevier Ltd
A state-of-the-art review on producing engineered biochar from shellfish waste and its application in aquaculture wastewater treatment,"Wan Mahari W.A., Waiho K., Azwar E., Fazhan H., Peng W., Ishak S.D., Tabatabaei M., Yek P.N.Y., Almomani F., Aghbashlo M., Lam S.S.",2022,Chemosphere,"Global production of shellfish aquaculture is steadily increasing owing to the growing market demands for shellfish. The intensification of shellfish aquaculture to maximize production rate has led to increased generation of aquaculture waste streams, particularly the effluents and shellfish wastes. If not effectively managed, these wastes could pose serious threats to human health and the ecosystem while compromising the overall sustainability of the industry. The present work comprehensively reviews the source, composition, and environmental implications of shellfish wastes and aquaculture wastewater. Moreover, recent advancements in the valorization of shellfish wastes into value-added biochar via emerging thermochemical and modification techniques are scrutinized. The utilization of the produced biochar in removing emerging pollutants from aquaculture wastewater is also discussed. It was revealed that shellfish waste-derived biochar exhibits relatively higher adsorption capacities (300–1500 mg/g) compared to lignocellulose biochar (<200 mg/g). The shellfish waste-derived biochar can be effectively employed for the removal of various contaminants such as antibiotics, heavy metals, and excessive nutrients from aquaculture wastewater. Finally, future research priorities and challenges faced to improve the sustainability of the shellfish aquaculture industry to effectively support global food security are elaborated. This review envisages that future studies should focus on the biorefinery concept to extract more useful compounds (e.g., carotenoid, chitin) from shellfish wastes for promoting environmental-friendly aquaculture. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Adsorbent; Aquaculture; Biochar; Pyrolysis; Shellfish; Wastewater,Effluents; Food supply; Health risks; Heavy metals; Shellfish; Sustainable development; Wastewater treatment; Aquaculture wastewater; Biochar; Engineered biochar; Global production; Growing markets; ITS applications; Market demand; Shellfish aquaculture; Shellfish waste; State-of-the art reviews; Aquaculture; aquaculture industry; biochar; detection method; food security; shellfish; sustainability; valorization; wastewater; wastewater treatment; biochar; charcoal; aquaculture; ecosystem; human; shellfish; water management; Aquaculture; Charcoal; Ecosystem; Humans; Shellfish; Water Purification,Elsevier Ltd

Metabolomics analysis of the 3D L-02 cell cultures revealing the key role of metabolism of amino acids in ameliorating hepatotoxicity of perfluorooctanoic acid,"Zhang R., Lu W., Yao Y., Tu L., Yu T., Luan T., Chen B.",2022,Science of the Total Environment,"To simulate the real cell status and morphology in the living systems is substantial for using cell models to address the detrimental effects of toxic contaminants. In this study, the comparative profiles of metabolites in three-dimensional (3D) human normal liver (L-02) cell spheroids with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) treatment were analyzed using a metabolomic approach. The uniform 3D cell spheroids were well formed in 3 days (e.g., sphericity index >0.9) and stably maintained over the subsequent 11 days. The cytotoxicity of PFOA to the 3D L-02 cell spheroids was highly dependent on both exposure concentration and duration. Comparative analysis of metabolomes showed that the number of differential metabolites in the 3D cell spheroids treated with 300 μM PFOA for 10 days (n = 59) was greater than those with a 4-day exposure to 300 μM PFOA (n = 17). Six metabolic pathways related to amino acids metabolism were only found in the 3D cell spheroids with a 10-day treatment of 300 μM PFOA, which could not be found in the 2D monolayer cells and those 3D cell spheroids with a 4-day exposure. The suppression of PFOA on glutamine metabolism substantially decreased glutathione (GSH) production and accordingly increased the level of reactive oxygen species in the 3D cell spheroids. On the contrary, the supplementation of glutamine increased GSH production and the viability of cell spheroids, indicating that glutamine metabolism played a critical role in the chronic toxic effects of PFOA. Our study strongly suggested that comprehensive toxicological methodologies based on the 3D cell models could currently be robust and suitable for addressing the chronic adverse effects of toxic contaminants. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",3D cell spheroids; Amino acids; Metabolomics; Perfluorooctanoic acid,Cell culture; Cells; Metabolism; Metabolites; 3d cell spheroid; Amino-acids; Cell model; Cell spheroids; Hepatotoxicity; Living systems; Metabolomic analysis; Metabolomics; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Toxic contaminants; Amino acids; glutamine; perfluorooctanoic acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; amino acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; amino acid; cell; metabolism; metabolite; polymer; reactive oxygen species; remediation; toxicity; adverse outcome; amino acid metabolism; Article; cell death; cell survival rate; chronic toxicity; comparative study; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cytotoxicity test; environmental exposure; human; human cell; liver cell; liver toxicity; long term exposure; metabolomics; short term exposure; signal transduction; three dimensional cell culture; cell culture technique; metabolomics; toxic hepatitis; Amino Acids; Caprylates; Cell Culture Techniques; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Metabolomics,Elsevier B.V.

Photocatalytic membranes: a new perspective for persistent organic pollutants removal,"Subramaniam M.N., Goh P.S., Kanakaraju D., Lim J.W., Lau W.J., Ismail A.F.",2022,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"The presence of conventional and emerging pollutants infiltrating into our water bodies is a course of concern as they have seriously threatened water security. Established techniques such as photocatalysis and membrane technology have proven to be promising in removing various persistent organic pollutants (POP) from wastewaters. The emergence of hybrid photocatalytic membrane which incorporates both photocatalysis and membrane technology has shown greater potential in treating POP laden wastewater based on their synergistic effects. This article provides an in-depth review on the roles of both photocatalysis and membrane technology in hybrid photocatalytic membranes for the treatment of POP containing wastewaters. A concise introduction on POP’s in terms of examples, their origins and their effect on a multitude of organisms are critically reviewed. The fundamentals of photocatalytic mechanism, current directions in photocatalyst design and their employment to treat POP’s are also discussed.

Specific Metabolites Involved in Antioxidation and Mitochondrial Function Are Correlated With Frailty in Elderly Men,"Meng L., Shi H., Wang D.-G., Shi J., Wu W.-B., Dang Y.-M., Fan G.-Q., Shen J., Yu P.-L., Dong J., Yang R.-Y., Xi H.",2022,Frontiers in Medicine,"Background: As an age-related syndrome, frailty may play a central role in poor health among older adults. Sarcopenia overlaps with the physical domain of frailty, and most existing studies have analyzed the associated factors of frailty and sarcopenia as an isolated state. Perturbations in metabolism may play an important role in the presence of frailty or sarcopenia; however, the metabolites associated with frailty, especially overlapping with sarcopenia remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore whether amino acids, carnitines, acylcarnitines and lysophosphatidylcholines, as specific panels, are significantly correlated with frailty, especially overlapping with sarcopenia, to gain insight into potential biomarkers and possible biological mechanisms and to facilitate their management. Methods: We applied a targeted high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach in serum samples from 246 Chinese older men (age 79.2 ± 7.8 years) with frailty (n = 150), non-frailty (n = 96), frailty and sarcopenia (n = 52), non-frail and non-sarcopenic control (n = 85). Frailty was evaluated using Freid phenotype criteria, sarcopenia was defined by diagnostic algorithm of Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia, and the participants were diagnosed as frailty and sarcopenia when they met the evaluation criteria of both frailty and sarcopenia. A panel of 29 metabolomic profiles was assayed and included different classes of amino acids, carnitines, acylcarnitines, and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). Multivariate logistic regression was used to screen the metabolic factors contributing to frailty status, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis was used to explore important factors and distinguish different groups. Results: In older men demonstrating the frail phenotype, amino acid perturbations included lower tryptophan and higher glycine levels. With regard to lipid metabolism, the frailty phenotype was characterized by lower concentrations of isovalerylcarnitine (C5), LPC16:0 and LPC18:2, while higher levels of octanoyl-L-carnitine (C8), decanoyl-L-carnitine (C10), dodecanoyl-L-carnitine (C12) and tetradecanoyl-L-carnitine (C14). After adjusting for several clinical confounders, tryptophan, LPC18:2, LPC 16:0 and C5 were negatively correlated with frailty, and C8 and C12 were positively related to frailty. We preliminarily identified metabolic profiles (LPC16:0, LPC18:2, glycine and tryptophan) that may distinguish older men with frailty from those without frailty. Importantly, a set of serum amino acids and LPCs (LPC16:0, LPC18:2, and tryptophan) was characterized in the metabotype of older adults with an overlap of frailty and sarcopenia. The metabolites that were most discriminating of frailty status implied that the underlying mechanism might be involved in antioxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusions: These present metabolic analyses may provide valuable information on the potential biomarkers and possible biological mechanisms of frailty, and overlapping sarcopenia. The findings obtained may offer insight into their management in older adults.

Anaerobic Microbial Dechlorination of 6:2 Chlorinated Polyfluorooctane Ether Sulfonate and the Underlying Mechanisms,"Yi S., Morson N., Edwards E.A., Yang D., Liu R., Zhu L., Mabury S.A.",2022,Environmental Science and Technology,"The microbial transformation potential of 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) was explored in anaerobic microbial systems. Microbial communities from anaerobic wastewater sludge, an anaerobic digester, and anaerobic dechlorinating cultures enriched from aquifer materials reductively dechlorinated 6:2 Cl-PFESA to 6:2 hydrogen-substituted polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (6:2 H-PFESA), which was identified as the sole metabolite by non-target analysis. Rapid and complete reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was achieved by the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures. The microbial community of the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures was impacted by 6:2 Cl-PFESA exposure. Organohalide-respiring bacteria originally present in the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures, including Geobacter, Dehalobacter, and Dehalococcoides, decreased in relative abundance over time. As the relative abundance of organohalide-respiring bacteria decreased, the rates of 6:2 Cl-PFESA dechlorination decreased, suggesting that the most likely mechanism for reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was co-metabolism rather than organohalide respiration. Reductive defluorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was not observed. Furthermore, 6:2 H-PFESA exhibited 5.5 times lower sorption affinity to the suspended biosolids than 6:2 Cl-PFESA, with the prospect of increased mobility in the environment. These results show the susceptibility of 6:2 Cl-PFESA to microbially mediated reductive dechlorination and the likely persistence of the product, 6:2 H-PFESA, in anaerobic environments. © 2022 American Chemical Society",anaerobic microbial community; biotransformation; co-metabolism; hydrophobicity; microbial composition; reductive dechlorination; sorption,Aquifers; Bacteria; Ethers; Metabolism; Metabolites; Anaerobic microbial community; Anaerobic microbial dechlorination; Anaerobics; Co metabolisms; Microbial communities; Microbial composition; Organohalides; Reductive dechlorination; Relative abundance; Sulphonates; Dechlorination; anoxic conditions; antimicrobial activity; bacterium; chemical reaction; metabolism; microbial activity; microbial community; salt; wastewater; wastewater treatment,American Chemical Society

Reactive High-Valent Iron Intermediates in Enhancing Treatment of Water by Ferrate,"Sharma V.K., Feng M., Dionysiou D.D., Zhou H.-C., Jinadatha C., Manoli K., Smith M.F., Luque R., Ma X., Huang C.-H.",2022,Environmental Science and Technology,"Efforts are being made to tune the reactivity of the tetraoxy anion of iron in the +6 oxidation state (FeVIO42–), commonly called ferrate, to further enhance its applications in various environmental fields. This review critically examines the strategies to generate highly reactive high-valent iron intermediates, FeVO43– (FeV) and FeIVO44– or FeIVO32– (FeIV) species, from FeVIO42–, for the treatment of polluted water with greater efficiency. Approaches to produce FeV and FeIV species from FeVIO42– include additions of acid (e.g., HCl), metal ions (e.g., Fe(III)), and reductants (R). Details on applying various inorganic reductants (R) to generate FeV and FeIV from FeVIO42– via initial single electron-transfer (SET) and oxygen-atom transfer (OAT) to oxidize recalcitrant pollutants are presented. The common constituents of urine (e.g., carbonate, ammonia, and creatinine) and different solids (e.g., silica and hydrochar) were found to accelerate the oxidation of pharmaceuticals by FeVIO42–, with potential mechanisms provided. The challenges of providing direct evidence of the formation of FeV/FeIV species are discussed. Kinetic modeling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide opportunities to distinguish between the two intermediates (i.e., FeIV and FeV) in order to enhance oxidation reactions utilizing FeVIO42–. Further mechanistic elucidation of activated ferrate systems is vital to achieve high efficiency in oxidizing emerging pollutants in various aqueous streams. © 2021 American Chemical Society",ferrate; high-valent iron intermediates; water treatment,Ammonia; Density functional theory; Efficiency; Health risks; Metal ions; Metals; Oxidation; Reaction intermediates; Silica; Water treatment; Environmental fields; Ferrate; High-valent iron intermediate; High-valent irons; Inorganics; ITS applications; Oxidation state; Polluted water; Reductants; Single electron transfer; Iron compounds; ammonia; carbonic acid; creatinine; endocrine disruptor; ferric ion; iron; metal ion; phenol derivative; phosphoprotein phosphatase; silicon dioxide; sulfadiazine; sulfonamide; trimethylamine; water; aqueous solution; chemical pollutant; concentration (composition); drug; oxidation; salt; urine; water treatment; aqueous solution; chemical reaction kinetics; chemical structure; chlorination; comparative study; controlled study; density functional theory; drug hydroxylation; electron transport; Escherichia coli; ionic strength; kinetic parameters; oxidation; oxidation kinetics; pulse radiolysis; rate constant; reaction time; Review; static electricity; stoichiometry; water pollution; water treatment,American Chemical Society
Which Micropollutants in Water Environments Deserve More Attention Globally?,"Yang Y., Zhang X., Jiang J., Han J., Li W., Li X., Yee Leung K.M., Snyder S.A., Alvarez P.J.",2022,Environmental Science and Technology,"Increasing chemical pollution of aquatic environments is a growing concern with global relevance. A large number of organic chemicals are termed as “micropollutants” due to their low concentrations, and long-term exposure to micropollutants may pose considerable risks to aquatic organisms and human health. In recent decades, numerous treatment methods and technologies have been proposed to remove micropollutants in water, and typically several micropollutants were chosen as target pollutants to evaluate removal efficiencies. However, it is often unclear whether their toxicity and occurrence levels and frequencies enable them to contribute significantly to the overall chemical pollution in global aquatic environments. This review intends to answer an important lingering question: Which micropollutants or class of micropollutants deserve more attention globally and should be removed with higher priority? Different risk-based prioritization approaches were used to address this question. The risk quotient (RQ) method was found to be a feasible approach to prioritize micropollutants in a large scale due to its relatively simple assessment procedure and extensive use. A total of 83 prioritization case studies using the RQ method in the past decade were compiled, and 473 compounds that were selected by screening 3466 compounds of three broad classes (pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, and industrial chemicals) were found to have risks (RQ > 0.01). To determine the micropollutants of global importance, we propose an overall risk surrogate, that is, the weighted average risk quotient (WARQ). The WARQ integrates the risk intensity and frequency of micropollutants in global aquatic environments to achieve a more comprehensive priority determination. Through metadata analysis, we recommend a ranked list of 53 micropollutants, including 36 PPCPs (e.g., sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen), seven pesticides (e.g., heptachlor and diazinon), and 10 industrial chemicals (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid and 4-nonylphenol) for risk management and remediation efforts. One caveat is that the ranked list of global importance does not consider transformation products of micropollutants (including disinfection byproducts) and new forms of pollutants (including antibiotic resistance genes and microplastics), and this list of global importance may not be directly applicable to a specific region or country. Also, it needs mentioning that there might be no best answer toward this question, and hopefully this review can act as a small step toward a better answer. © 2021 American Chemical Society",micropollutants; PPCPs; prioritization; risk assessment; risk quotient,Aquatic organisms; Disinfection; Efficiency; Health risks; Industrial chemicals; Organic chemicals; Pesticides; Risk management; Water pollution; Aquatic environments; Average risk; Chemical pollution; Micropollutants; Pharmaceutical and personal care products; Prioritization; Risk quotients; Risks assessments; Water environments; Weighted averages; Risk assessment,American Chemical Society
Patient-reported outcome measures for pain in women with pelvic floor disorders: a systematic review,"Ralphsmith M., Ahern S., Dean J., Ruseckaite R.",2022,International Urogynecology Journal,"Introduction and hypothesis: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are helpful instruments when measuring and reporting changes in patient health status (Al Sayah et al. J Patient Rep Outcomes 5 (Suppl 2):99, 2021) such as the health-related quality of life (HrQoL) of women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The Australasian Pelvic Floor Procedure Registry (APFPR) aims to increase capacity for women to report surgical outcomes through the collection of HrQoL data (Ruseckaite et al. Qual Life Res. 2021) but currently lacks a pain-specific PROM for women with pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), particularly POP and SUI. This review aims to systematically review the existing literature and identify instruments that measure pain in women with POP and SUI for inclusion within the APFPR, which reports on complications from these conditions. Methods: We conducted a literature search on OVID MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EMCARE databases in addition to Google Scholar and grey literature to identify studies from inception to April 2021. Full-text studies were included if they used PROMs to measure pain in women with POP and SUI. Two authors independently screened articles, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Results: From 2001 studies, 23 publications describing 19 different PROMs were included for analysis. Eight of these instruments were specific to the pelvic floor; four were only specific to pain and used across multiple disorders; three were generic quality of life instruments and four were other non-validated instruments such as focus group interviews. These instruments were not specific to pain in women with POP or SUI, as they did not identify all relevant domains such as the sensation, region and duration of pain, or incidents where onset of pain occurs. Conclusions: The findings of this review suggest there are no current PROMs that are suitable pain-specific instruments for women with POP or SUI. This knowledge may inform and assist in the development of a new PROM to be implemented into the APFPR. © 2022, The Author(s).",Pain; Patient-reported outcome measures; Pelvic floor disorder; Public health; Registry,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
Lubrication Performance and Mechanism of Perfluoropolyether Carboxylate Ammonium Ionic Liquids [全氟聚醚羧酸铵离子液体的润滑性能及润滑机理研究],"Han Y., Qiao D., Li J., Fan M., Feng D.",2022,Mocaxue Xuebao/Tribology,"Perfluoropolyethers (PFPE) is a kind of high performance synthetic lubricant with low volatility, high thermal and oxidation stability, good chemical inertia and insulation performance, as well as a wide range of liquid temperature and excellent viscosity-temperature characteristics. PFPE has been widely used in aerospace, military, nuclear industry, computer disk and other fields. With the rapid development of industrial technology, new requirements have been proposed for the performance of the lubricants. As a result, the common perfluoropolyethers as lubricants gradually cannot work well under the present working conditions. Moreover, it is difficult to improve the lubrication performance of perfluoropolyethers by conventional additives technology due to their poor compatibility with conventional additives. Hence, in order to improve the antifriction and antiwear properties of perfluoropolyethers, researchers focused on modifying their structures. Great efforts have been paid to improve the performance of perfluoropolyethers as lubrication film in the field of computer disk, but as a kind of important aviation lubricating oils, their lubrication performances are also in urgent need of improvement. In this context, in this study three kinds of perfluoropolyether carboxylate ammonium ionic liquids (PF-BA, PF-DBA and PF-TBA) were designed and synthesized by modifying the structure of perfluoropolyether carboxylic acid (PFPEC) with different amines. The structures of synthesized ionic liquids were confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. Their shear stress and viscosity at different shear rates were evaluated by a Rheometer, and the wetting ability on metal surfaces were analyzed by the contact angle. Their lubrication performance for steel/steel and steel/tin bronze friction pairs at 25 ℃ and 100 ℃ were evaluated and compared by Optimal SRV-V oscillating friction and wear tester, where PFPE and PFPEC were used as reference samples. And the variation of the tribofilm during the friction process were revealed by the change of contact resistance. The surface morphologies and element state were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. Tribochemical reactions were investigated by comparing the change in surface morphologies and element state of wear spot. By combining the above results, the lubrication mechanism was explored. Results showed that all the synthesized ionic liquids exhibited higher shear stress and viscosity than PFPEC. Specifically, the ionic liquids with more N-H bonds in the cation exhibited higher viscosity and shear stress, possibly due to the formation of hydrogen bond that can increase the intermolecular interactions. The viscosity and shear stress gradually decreased with the increase of shear rate, while the viscosity of the ionic liquids with more N-H bond in the cation decreased more rapidly. On the surface of tin bronze, the three ionic liquids exhibited better wetting performance than PFPEC, but poorer than PFPE. While on the steel surface, the three ionic liquids exhibited better wetting abilities than PFPEC and PFPE. As lubricants for steel/tin bronze friction pairs, the friction coefficients and wear volumes of the three ionic liquids were close to those of PFPE and PFPEC at room temperature, and their lubrication performance was improved insignificantly. The synthesized ionic liquids exhibited much better anti-friction and anti-wear performance at high temperature (100 ℃) than PFPE and PFPEC. As lubricants for steel/steel friction pairs at room temperature, the friction coefficients of the three ionic liquids were similar to that of PFPEC, and even a little higher than PFPE; while the wear volumes decreased about 60%-70% in comparison with PFPE and PFPEC. At 100 ℃, compared with PFPE and PFPEC, the friction coefficients of the three ionic liquids were much more stable and lower, and the wear volumes were reduced by 70% ~ 80%. Summarily, three synthesized ionic liquids had better friction-reduction and anti-wear properties than that of PFPE and PFPEC both at room temperature and at high temperature as lubricants for steel/steel friction pair. The contact resistances reflected the variation of the tribofilm, i.e. the higher contact resistance, the thicker tribofilm and better lubricating properties. The results of tested contact resistances were consistent with the friction tests results. According to the SEM morphologies of the worn surface lubricated by different lubricants, both the tin bronze and steel worn surfaces exhibited abrasive wear. Among them, the worn surfaces lubricated by ionic liquids PF-TBA were the smoother, and the parallel grooves were the shallower both at room temperature and high temperature. The steel worn surfaces lubricated by the three ionic liquids were much smoother than that of PEPE and PEPEC. From the XPS results, it can be seen that the composition and content of the friction films on the worn surface lubricated by the three synthesized ionic liquids were different from that of PEPEC. The tribofilm formed on the steel surfaces lubricated by the ionic liquids was consisted of Fe3O4, Fe2O3 and FeF3, the nitrogen-containing compounds and adsorbed ionic liquids. The adsorption film of the ionic liquids on the metal surface was strong and the tribofilm was thick. The combined results of multiple physical and chemical analysis showed that the excellent friction-reduction and anti-wear properties of synthesized ionic liquids can be attributed to their excellent adsorption properties on the metal surface and the formation of stable tribofilm.

Nano/Microplastics Capture and Degradation by Autonomous Nano/Microrobots: A Perspective,"Urso M., Pumera M.",2022,Advanced Functional Materials,"The growing use of plastic materials has led to the continuous accumulation of wastes in marine environments, which fragment into hazardous micro-and nanoplastics. These plastic particles absorb toxic organic pollutants on their surface, support bacterial biofilms growth, and propagate through the food chain, posing serious risks for human health. Therefore, nano/microplastics pollution has become a global issue, making their definitive elimination compulsory. Self-propelled nano/microrobots have demonstrated efficient removal of nano/microplastics from water, combining enhanced physicochemical properties of nano/microscale materials and active motion. During the last year, the potential of this technology to degrade nano/microplastics has been investigated. Here, the most advanced strategies for nano/microplastics capture and subsequent degradation by autonomous nano/microrobots are critically reviewed. A short introduction to the main propulsion mechanisms and experimental techniques for studying nano/microplastics degradation is also provided. Forthcoming challenges in this research field are discussed proactively.

This review retrieved peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2010 and 2021 from journal databases consisting of Web of Science, Scopus and ScienceDirect. This review shows that multiple Pseudomonas species could degrade perfluorochemicals particularly perfluoroalkyl acids under aerobic condition. Acidimicrobium sp. degraded perfluoroalkyl acids anaerobically in the presence of electron donors. A mixed Pseudomonas culture was more effective than pure cultures. Multiple plants were found to bioconcentrate perfluorochemicals and many demonstrated the ability to hyperaccumulate perfluoroalkyl acids, particularly Festuca rubra, Salix nigra and Betula nigra. Fungal species, particularly Pseudeurotium sp. and Geomyces sp., have the potential to degrade perfluorooctanoic acid or perfluorooctane sulphonic acid. Perfluorochemicals bioremediation could be advanced with identification of more candidate species for bioremediation, optimization of bioremediation conditions, mixed culturing, experiments with environmental media and studies on the biochemical pathways of biotransformation. This review provides comprehensive insight into the efficiency of different bacterial, plant and fungal species in perfluorochemicals bioremediation under different conditions, their limitations and improvement. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Bacteria; Biodegradation; Fungi; Perfluorochemicals; Plants,Bacteria; Biodegradation; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Efficiency; 'current; Condition; Fungal species; Future prospects; Health concerns; Journal articles; Perfluoroalkyl acids; Perfluorochemicals; Plant; Plant bacteria; Fungi,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH

"Genomic Characterization of Parengyodontium torokii sp. nov., a Biofilm-Forming Fungus Isolated from Mars 2020 Assembly Facility","Parker C.W., Teixeira M.M., Singh N.K., Raja H.A., Cank K.B., Spigolon G., Oberlies N.H., Barker B.M., Stajich J.E., Mason C.E., Venkateswaran K.",2022,Journal of Fungi,"A fungal strain (FJII-L10-SW-P1) was isolated from the Mars 2020 spacecraft assembly facility and exhibited biofilm formation on spacecraft-qualified Teflon surfaces. The reconstruction of a six-loci gene tree (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1 and RPB2, and TEF1) using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses of the strain FJII-L10-SW-P1 supported a close relationship to other known Parengyodontium album subclade 3 isolates while being phylogenetically distinct from subclade 1 strains. The zig-zag rachides morphology of the conidiogenous cells and spindle-shaped conidia were the distinct morphological characteristics of the P. album subclade 3 strains. The MLST data and morphological analysis supported the conclusion that the P. album subclade 3 strains could be classified as a new species of the genus Parengyodontium and placed in the family Cordycipitaceae. The name Parengyodontium torokii sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate the strain, with FJII-L10-SW-P1 as the holotype. The genome of the FJII-L10-SW-P1 strain was sequenced, annotated, and the secondary metabolite clusters were identified. Genes predicted to be responsible for biofilm formation and adhesion to surfaces were identified. Homology-based assignment of gene ontologies to the predicted proteome of P. torokii revealed the presence of gene clusters responsible for synthesizing several metabolic compounds, including a cytochalasin that was also verified using traditional metabolomic analysis. © 2022 by the authors.

Different Metabolomic and Proteomic Profiles of Cerebrospinal Fluid in Ventricular and Lumbar Compartments in Relation to Leptomeningeal Metastases,"Kwon J.-W., Im J.H., Lee K.-Y., Yoo B.C., Lee J.H., Kim K.-H., Kim J.H., Shin S.H., Yoo H., Gwak H.-S.",2022,Metabolites,"The different molecular profiles of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) between ventricular and lumbar compartments remain elusive, especially in the context of leptomeningeal metastasis (LM), which affects CSF flow. We evaluated CSF metabolomic and proteomic profiles based on the compartments and the diagnosis of spinal LM, proved by MRI from 20 paired ventricular and lumbar CSF samples of LM patients, including 12 spinal LM (+) samples. In metabolome analysis, 9512 low-mass ions (LMIs) were identified—7 LMIs were abundant in all lumbar versus paired ventricular CSF samples, and 3 LMIs were significantly abundant in all ventricular CSF. In comparisons between spinal LM (+) CSF and LM (−) CSF, 105 LMIs were discriminative for spinal LM (+) CSF. In proteome analysis, a total of 1536 proteins were measured. A total of 18 proteins, including complement C3, were more highly expressed in all lumbar CSF, compared with paired ventricular CSF, while 82 proteins, including coagulation factor V, were higher in the ventricular CSF. Of 37 discriminative proteins, including uteroglobin and complement component C8 gamma chain, 4 were higher in all spinal LM (+) CSF versus spinal LM (−) CSF. We further evaluated metabolic pathways associated with these discriminative proteins using the Gene Ontology database. We found that 16/17 spinal LM (+) pathways, including complement activation, were associated with lumbar discriminative proteins, whereas only 2 pathways were associated with ventricular-discriminative proteins. In conclusion, we determined that metabolite and protein profiles differed between paired lumbar and ventricular CSF samples. The protein profiles of spinal LM (+) CSF showed more similarity with the lumbar CSF than the ventricular CSF. Thus, we suggest that CSF LMIs and proteins could reflect LM disease activity and that LM-associated differences in CSF are more likely to be present in the lumbar compartment. © 2022 by the authors.

"Recent Advancements in Polysulfone Based Membranes for Fuel Cell (PEMFCs, DMFCs and AMFCs) Applications: A Critical Review","Vinodh R., Atchudan R., Kim H.-J., Yi M.",2022,Polymers,"In recent years, ion electrolyte membranes (IEMs) preparation and properties have attracted fabulous attention in fuel cell usages owing to its high ionic conductivity and chemical resistance. Currently, perfluorinatedsulfonicacid (PFSA) membrane has been widely employed in the membrane industry in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs); however, Nafion™ suffers reduced proton conductivity at a higher temperature, requiring noble metal catalyst (Pt, Ru, and Pt-Ru), and catalyst poisoning by CO. Non-fluorinated polymers are a promising substitute. Polysulfone (PSU) is an aromatic polymer with excellent characteristics that have attracted membrane scientists in recent years. The present review provides an up-to-date development of PSU based electrolyte membranes and its composites for PEMFCs, alkaline membrane fuel cells (AMFCs), and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) application. Various fillers encapsulated in the PEM/AEM moiety are appraised according to their preliminary characteristics and their plausible outcome on PEMFC/DMFC/AMFC. The key issues associated with enhancing the ionic conductivity and chemical stability have been elucidated as well. Furthermore, this review addresses the current tasks, and forthcoming directions are briefly summarized of PEM/AEMs for PEMFCs, DMFCs, AMFCs. © 2022 by the authors.

"""non-invasive"" portable laser ablation sampling for lead isotope analysis of archaeological silver: A comparison with bulk and: In situ laser ablation techniques","Merkel S.W., D'Imporzano P., Van Zuilen K., Kershaw J., Davies G.R.",2022,Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry,"The main factor restricting lead isotope analysis of metals from museum collections is the requirement for physical material. Hence, there are major incentives for developing minimally invasive methods for lead isotope analysis that are accurate and precise enough to reveal historical information about artefacts and their origin. Portable laser ablation (pLA), collecting microscopic samples on Teflon filters, has four key benefits. It produces no visual impact to the artefacts, does not require transport of artefacts to laboratory facilities, there are no artefact size restrictions, and samples are processed under clean laboratory conditions allowing Pb purification prior to measurement by solution MC-ICPMS. To validate the efficacy of the pLA technique on silver, nine matrixed-matched commercial, in-house and archaeological reference materials were sampled and analysed multiple times (9-10). The pLA mean analyses (±2SD) were all consistent with inter-laboratory bulk analyses. The digestion of sample filters produces precisions that are consistently more than five-times better than in situ nsLA-MC-ICPMS and are the same order of magnitude expected for bulk samples processed in different laboratories.

Two types of processes integrate these membrane types: Separation processes, where electrospun polymers act as a support for thin film composites (TFC), and adsorption as single or coupled processes (photo-catalysis, advanced oxidation, electrochemical), where a functionalization step is essential for the electrospun polymer to improve its properties. Emerging pollutants (EPs) released in the environment can be efficiently removed from water systems using electrospun membranes. The relevant results regarding removal efficiency, adsorption capacity, and the size and porosity of the membranes and fibers used for different EPs are described in detail. © 2021 by the authors.",Electrospinning; Emerging pollutants; Membranes,Electrospinning; Image enhancement; Water pollution; Electrospinning process; Electrospun polymers; Emerging pollutants; Literature reviews; Membrane types; Pollutants removal; Polymer materials; Separation process; Single process; Thin film composites; Membranes,MDPI
"Recovery of Palladium by Extraction-electrodeposition Using N, N, N’, N’, N”, N”- Hexaoctyl-nitrilotriacetamide","Kinoshita R., Matsumiya M., Sasaki Y.",2022,Solvent Extraction and Ion Exchange,"It is essential to develop solvent extraction (SX), and electrodeposition (ED) processes for palladium to reduce the volume of acid and organic media. In this study, the extraction reaction of Pd(II) in chloride media using of N, N, N’, N’, N”, N”-hexaoctyl-nitrilotriacetamide (NTAamide(C8)) as a novel extractant has been demonstrated. Three diluents with high dielectric constants (acetophenone (AP), 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), and 1-octanol (OC)) were used for the solvent extraction reaction. The slope analysis indicated that the anion exchange extraction reaction of Pd(II) was consistent with an approximately 2:1 stoichiometry for the NTAamide(C8)/AP and NTAamide(C8)/DCE systems, and 1:1 for NTAamide(C8)/OC. Moreover, the ED behavior of the extracted Pd(II) complex was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Palladium reduction was found to be an irreversible process based on analysis of the standard rate constant. A semi-integral analysis of the voltammogram determined the diffusion coefficients of the extracted Pd(II) complex in the AP, DCE, and OC systems to be 3.7 ± 0.1 × 10−10, 2.8 ± 0.1 × 10−10 and 1.5 ± 0.2 × 10−10 m2 s−1, respectively. Furthermore, consecutive extraction-electrodeposition processes using the NTAamide(C8)/AP system were carried out for five cycles. High extraction percentage (E &gt; 91%) and current efficiency (ε &gt; 83.1%) were attained in all cycles. The electrodeposits recovered from the extraction-electrodeposition process were identified as Pd metal through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Chloride media; extraction-electrodeposition; NTAamide(C8); palladium,Chlorine compounds; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrodeposition; Electrodes; Metal analysis; Metal recovery; Palladium compounds; Rate constants; Solvent extraction; Statistical mechanics; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; 1-octanol; Acetophenones; Acid media; Chloride media; Dichloroethane; Electrodeposition process; Extraction reaction; Extraction-electrodeposition; Ntaamide(c8); Organic media; Ketones,Taylor and Francis Ltd.
The transplacental transfer efficiency of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS): a first meta-analysis,"Appel M., Forsthuber M., Ramos R., Widhalm R., Granitzer S., Uhl M., Hengstschläger M., Stamm T., Gundacker C.",2022,Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health - Part B: Critical Reviews,"Per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS), ubiquitously present in the environment and biota, are transferred to the fetus via the placenta. PFAS can be distinguished, among other things, by their different carbon chain lengths and functional groups. The aim of this study was to provide comprehensive evidence on PFAS transfer rates across the human placental barrier by means of a meta-analysis based upon a systematic review. The available literature up to April 2021 was reviewed and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) of PFAS assessed. A total of 39 studies reporting data on 20 PFAS were included in the systematic review. Of these, 20 studies with data on 19 compounds were included in the meta-analysis. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA v3.0) was used for quantitative, statistical analyses with random effects models. A curvilinear relationship was found with short and long chains of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) exhibiting higher TTE than compounds with intermediate chain length. Among the less well studied PFAS, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), 6:2 fluorotelomersulfonic acid (6:2 FTS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) stood out the most with a high TEEs. The dependence of TTEs on chain length and functional group is clearly shown in this first meta-analysis on PFAS transfer across the human placenta. More data on effects of less well studied PFAS in pregnant women and neonates are needed to assess the potential risk for fetal exposure. © 2021 The Author(s).

"PFAS exposure of humans, animals and the environment: Protocol of an evidence review map and bibliometric analysis","Vendl C., Taylor M.D., Bräunig J., Gibson M.J., Hesselson D., Gregory Neely G., Lagisz M., Nakagawa S.",2022,Environment International,"Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) substances are a group of anthropogenic organic chemicals. PFAS have numerous applications in the industrial and commercial fields. They have become abundant in the environment and have been detected in the blood of humans and animals. PFAS exposure likely increases the risk of certain diseases. In recent years, there has been a steep rise in related primary and secondary articles. Objectives: We aim to collate narrative and systematic reviews including both qualitative and quantitative synthesis on biological, environmental, or medical aspects of PFAS exposure and burdens, and to create an evidence review map to fulfil three main objectives. 1) Mappingto reveal what evidence on PFAS has been systematically reviewed and where synthesis may be needed. 2) Bibliometrics: to characterise the interdisciplinarity, independence and connectedness of the reviews. 3) Critical appraisal: to assess the included reviews for the reliability of conclusions and methodological transparency. This overview of reviews will inform future research and policy making. Search and study eligibility: We will perform a systematic search on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and the ‘grey literature’. To be included in the map, a study must be a review from the systematic review family and focus on at least one of predefined 31 PFAS. We will limit inclusions to peer-reviewed publications, pre-prints, and theses without any language restrictions. At least two authors will scan title, abstract and keywords, followed by full-text screening of included reviews. Critical appraisal of reviews and synthesis methods: We will assess each review of the systematic review family referencing the AMSTAR2 checklist. We will collect information on conflict-of-interest statements, funding sources and availability of raw data and analysis code. We will extract relevant data from full texts and bibliographic records, conduct bibliometric analyses, and display findings as tables, figures and a narrative synopsis. © 2021 The Authors",Ecotoxicology; PFOA; PFOS; ‘Overview of reviews’; ‘Systematic review’; ‘Umbrella review’,Abstracting; Diagnosis; Organic chemicals; Anthropogenic organic chemicals; Bibliometrics analysis; Eco-toxicology; Map analysis; PFOA; PFOS; Systematic Review; ‘overview of review’; ‘systematic review’; ‘umbrella review’; Animals,Elsevier Ltd
"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposure, maternal metabolomic perturbation, and fetal growth in African American women: A meet-in-the-middle approach","Chang C.-J., Barr D.B., Ryan P.B., Panuwet P., Smarr M.M., Liu K., Kannan K., Yakimavets V., Tan Y., Ly V., Marsit C.J., Jones D.P., Corwin E.J., Dunlop A.L., Liang D.",2022,Environment International,"Background: Prenatal exposures to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been linked to reduced fetal growth. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study aims to investigate biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers underlying the association between serum PFAS and fetal growth using high-resolution metabolomics in a cohort of pregnant African American women in the Atlanta area, Georgia. Methods: Serum perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measurements and untargeted serum metabolomics profiling were conducted in 313 pregnant African American women at 8–14 weeks gestation. Multiple linear regression models were applied to assess the associations of PFAS with birth weight and small-for-gestational age (SGA) birth. A high-resolution metabolomics workflow including metabolome-wide association study, pathway enrichment analysis, and chemical annotation and confirmation with a meet-in-the-middle approach was performed to characterize the biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers of the PFAS-fetal growth relationship. Results: Each log2-unit increase in serum PFNA concentration was significantly associated with higher odds of SGA birth (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.07, 1.63); similar but borderline significant associations were found in PFOA (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.94, 1.49) with SGA. Among 25,516 metabolic features extracted from the serum samples, we successfully annotated and confirmed 10 overlapping metabolites associated with both PFAS and fetal growth endpoints, including glycine, taurine, uric acid, ferulic acid, 2-hexyl-3-phenyl-2-propenal, unsaturated fatty acid C18:1, androgenic hormone conjugate, parent bile acid, and bile acid-glycine conjugate. Also, we identified 21 overlapping metabolic pathways from pathway enrichment analyses. These overlapping metabolites and pathways were closely related to amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism perturbations. Conclusion: In this cohort of pregnant African American women, higher serum concentrations of PFOA and PFNA were associated with reduced fetal growth. Perturbations of biological pathways involved in amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism were associated with PFAS exposures and reduced fetal growth, and uric acid was shown to be a potential intermediate biomarker. Our results provide opportunities for future studies to develop early detection and intervention for PFAS-induced fetal growth restriction. © 2021",Biomarkers; Fetal growth; High-resolution metabolomics; PFAS,Amino acids; Chemical analysis; Linear regression; Metabolism; Metabolites; Unsaturated fatty acids; African american women; Bile acid; Biological pathways; Fetal growth; Gestational age; High-resolution metabolomics; Meet-in-the-middle; Perfluorononanoic acids; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Biomarkers; 2 hexyl 3 phenyl 2 propenal; aldehyde; androgen; bile acid; ferulic acid; glycine; organofluorine derivative; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; taurine; unclassified drug; unsaturated fatty acid; uric acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; biomarker; metabolism; metabolite; organohalogen; pregnancy; serum; adult; African American; amino acid metabolism; Article; bile acid metabolism; birth weight; cohort analysis; controlled study; fatty acid metabolism; female; fetus; fetus growth; Georgia (U.S.); gestation period; hormone metabolism; human; infant; lipid metabolism; low birth weight; major clinical study; male; metabolite; metabolome; metabolomics; pregnancy; prematurity; prenatal exposure; risk factor; small for date infant; fetus development; maternal exposure; metabolomics; pollutant; pregnancy; toxicity; Atlanta; Georgia; United States; Atlanta; African Americans; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fetal Development; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Metabolomics; Pregnancy,Elsevier Ltd
Prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants and childhood obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis of human studies,"Stratakis N., Rock S., La Merrill M.A., Saez M., Robinson O., Fecht D., Vrijheid M., Valvi D., Conti D.V., McConnell R., Chatzi V.L.",2022,Obesity Reviews,"We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations between prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and childhood obesity. We focused on organochlorines (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT], dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE], hexachlorobenzene [HCB], and polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]), perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) that are the POPs more widely studied in environmental birth cohorts so far. We search two databases (PubMed and Embase) through July/09/2021 and identified 33 studies reporting associations with prenatal organochlorine exposure, 21 studies reporting associations with prenatal PFAS, and five studies reporting associations with prenatal PBDEs. We conducted a qualitative review. Additionally, we performed random-effects meta-analyses of POP exposures, with data estimates from at least three prospective studies, and BMI-z. Prenatal DDE and HCB levels were associated with higher BMI z-score in childhood (beta: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.21; I2: 28.1% per study-specific log increase of DDE and beta: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.53; I2: 31.9% per study-specific log increase of HCB). No significant associations between PCB-153, PFOA, PFOS, or pentaPBDEs with childhood BMI were found in meta-analyses.

Mitochondrial dysfunction governs immunometabolism in leukocytes of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure,"Zhang I.W., Curto A., López-Vicario C., Casulleras M., Duran-Güell M., Flores-Costa R., Colsch B., Aguilar F., Aransay A.M., Lozano J.J., Hernández-Tejero M., Toapanta D., Fernández J., Arroyo V., Clària J.",2022,Journal of Hepatology,"Background &amp; Aims: Patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) present a systemic hyperinflammatory response associated with increased circulating levels of small-molecule metabolites. To investigate whether these alterations reflect inadequate cell energy output, we assessed mitochondrial morphology and central metabolic pathways with emphasis on the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in peripheral leukocytes from patients with acutely decompensated (AD) cirrhosis, with and without ACLF. Methods: The study included samples from patients with AD cirrhosis (108 without and 128 with ACLF) and 41 healthy individuals. Leukocyte mitochondrial ultrastructure was visualized by transmission electron microscopy and cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolic fluxes were determined by assessing NADH/FADH2 production from various substrates. Plasma GDF15 and FGF21 were determined by Luminex and acylcarnitines by LC-MS/MS. Gene expression was analyzed by RNA-sequencing and PCR-based glucose metabolism profiler array. Results: Mitochondrial ultrastructure in patients with advanced cirrhosis was distinguished by cristae rarefication and swelling. The number of mitochondria per leukocyte was higher in patients, accompanied by a reduction in their size. Increased FGF21 and C6:0- and C8:0-carnitine predicted mortality whereas GDF15 strongly correlated with a gene set signature related to leukocyte activation. Metabolic flux analyses revealed increased energy production in mononuclear leukocytes from patients with preferential involvement of extra-mitochondrial pathways, supported by upregulated expression of genes encoding enzymes of the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways. In patients with ACLF, mitochondrial function analysis uncovered break-points in the TCA cycle at the isocitrate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase level, which were bridged by anaplerotic reactions involving glutaminolysis and nucleoside metabolism. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence at the cellular, organelle and biochemical levels that severe mitochondrial dysfunction governs immunometabolism in leukocytes from patients with AD cirrhosis and ACLF. Lay summary: Patients at advanced stages of liver disease have dismal prognosis due to vital organ failures and the lack of treatment options. In this study, we report that the functioning of mitochondria, which are known as the cell powerhouse, is severely impaired in leukocytes of these patients, probably as a consequence of intense inflammation. Mitochondrial dysfunction is therefore a hallmark of advanced liver disease. © 2021 The Authors",ACLF; acute decompensated cirrhosis; immune cells; metabolic phenotype; mitochondria; RNA-seq,"5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (FADH2); carnitine; fibroblast growth factor 21; growth differentiation factor 15; isocitrate dehydrogenase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; succinate dehydrogenase; immunologic factor; acute on chronic liver failure; Article; cell ultrastructure; citric acid cycle; controlled study; decompensated liver cirrhosis; disorders of mitochondrial functions; gene expression; glucose metabolism; glycolysis; human; human cell; leukocyte metabolism; liver cytosol; liver mitochondrion; metabolic flux analysis; mitochondrial volume; mitochondrion swelling; mononuclear cell; mortality; pentose phosphate cycle; polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequencing; transmission electron microscopy; acute on chronic liver failure; complication; disorders of mitochondrial functions; immunology; leukocyte; metabolism; microbiology; pathophysiology; procedures; tandem mass spectrometry; Acute-On-Chronic Liver Failure; Humans; Immunologic Factors; Leukocytes; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Mitochondrial Diseases; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Elsevier B.V.
A review of environmental metabolism disrupting chemicals and effect biomarkers associating disease risks: Where exposomics meets metabolomics,"Sun J., Fang R., Wang H., Xu D.-X., Yang J., Huang X., Cozzolino D., Fang M., Huang Y.",2022,Environment International,"Humans are exposed to an ever-increasing number of environmental toxicants, some of which have gradually been elucidated to be important risk factors for metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. These metabolism-sensitive diseases typically occur when key metabolic and signaling pathways were disrupted, which can be influenced by the exposure to contaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), along with genetic and lifestyle factors. This promotes the concept and research on environmental metabolism disrupting chemicals (MDCs). In addition, identifying endogenous biochemical markers of effect linked to disease states is becoming an important tool to screen the biological targets following environmental contaminant exposure, as well as to provide an overview of toxicity risk assessment. As such, the current review aims to contribute to the further understanding of exposome and human health and disease by characterizing environmental exposure and effect metabolic biomarkers. We summarized MDC-associated metabolic biomarkers in laboratory animal and human cohort studies using high throughput targeted and nontargeted metabolomics techniques. Contaminants including heavy metals and organohalogen compounds, especially EDCs, have been repetitively associated with metabolic disorders, whereas emerging contaminants such as perfluoroalkyl substances and microplastics have also been found to disrupt metabolism. In addition, we found major limitations in the effective identification of metabolic biomarkers especially in human studies, toxicological research on the mixed effect of environmental exposure has also been insufficient compared to the research on single chemicals. Thus, it is timely to call for research efforts dedicated to the study of combined effect and metabolic alterations for the better assessment of exposomic toxicology and health risks. Moreover, advanced computational and prediction tools, further validation of metabolic biomarkers, as well as systematic and integrative investigations are also needed in order to reliably identify novel biomarkers and elucidate toxicity mechanisms, and to further utilize exposome and metabolome profiling in public health and safety management. © 2021",Biomarker; Endocrine disrupting chemical; Exposome; Metabolic disease; Metabolism disrupting chemical; Metabolome,Biomarkers; Endocrine disrupters; Health; Health risks; Heavy metals; Indicators (chemical); Risk assessment; Toxicity; Disease risks; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Environmental exposure; Exposed to; Exposome; Metabolic biomarkers; Metabolic disease; Metabolism disrupting chemical; Metabolomes; Metabolomics; Metabolism; biomarker; disease; endocrine disruptor; health risk; metabolism; biological marker; endocrine disruptor; plastic; animal; environmental exposure; human; metabolomics; Animals; Biomarkers; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Metabolomics; Plastics,Elsevier Ltd

The major findings are: 1) among the aqueous matrices for which data were reviewed, groundwater impacted by AFFF contamination showed the highest median concentrations for both perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), while the second-highest median concentrations were associated with landfill leachates for PFOA and metal-plating sources for PFOS; 2) many of the unknown polyfluorinated precursors present in AFFF-impacted sites could potentially convert to persistent PFAS by abiotic or biotic transformation, and therefore could act as the long-term source of contamination to the environment; 3) part per billion (ppb) concentrations of PFAS were detected in water bodies surrounding fluorochemical manufacturing plants; 4) in consumer products such as textile, paper, and personal care products, PFOA concentrations were an order of magnitude higher compared to other PFAS; 5) biotransformation products such as fluorotelomer carboxylic acids (FTCAs) and perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are detected in landfill leachates and WWTP effluents; and 6) many studies have shown increased PFAA concentrations in WWTP effluents compared to influents. This work provides a comprehensive review of the literature on the PFAS concentration and composition trends of select non-polymeric PFAS in different sources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",AFFF; Landfill leachates; Metal plating; Paper coating; PFAS; PFAS sources; Wastewater,"carboxylic acid derivative; fluorotelomer carboxylic acid; ground water; metal; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl acid; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; carboxylic acid; fluorocarbon; ground water; water; chemical compound; chemical substance; concentration (composition); detection method; pollutant source; biotransformation; chemical composition; coating (procedure); concentration (parameter); consumer; effluent; electroplating; environmental impact; foam; human; landfill leachate; manufacturing; Review; waste water treatment plant; water pollution; waste disposal facility; water pollutant; Carboxylic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Groundwater; Waste Disposal Facilities; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Academic Press
"Exposure routes, bioaccumulation and toxic effects of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) on plants: A critical review","Li J., Sun J., Li P.",2022,Environment International,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are artificial persistent organic pollutants ubiquitous in ecosystem, and their bioaccumulation and adverse outcomes in plants have attracted extensive concerns. Here, we review the toxic effects of PFASs encountered by various plants from physiological, biochemical and molecular perspectives. The exposure routes and bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites are also summarized. The bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites varied between ng/g and μg/g levels. The 50% inhibition concentration of PFASs for plant growth is often several orders of magnitude higher than the environmentally relevant concentrations (ERCs). ERCs of PFASs rarely lead to obvious phenotypic/physiological damages in plants, but markedly perturb some biological activities at biochemical and molecular scales. PFAS exposure induces the over-generated reactive oxygen species and further damages plant cell structure and organelle functions. A number of biochemical activities in plant cells are perturbed, such as photosynthesis, gene expression, protein synthesis, carbon and nitrogen metabolisms. To restore the desire states of cells exposed to PFASs, plants initiate several detoxifying mechanisms, including enzymatic antioxidants, non-enzymatic antioxidants, metallothionein genes and metabolic reprogramming. Future challenges and opportunities in PFAS phytotoxicity studies are also proposed in the review. © 2021 The Author(s)",Bioaccumulation; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs); Phytotoxicity; Plant; Risk assessment; The 50% inhibition concentration (IC50),"Antioxidants; Biochemistry; Biosynthesis; Gene expression; Metabolism; Organic pollutants; Plants (botany); Risk assessment; Toxicity; Contaminated sites; Critical review; Inhibition concentrations; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Phytotoxicity; Plant; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Risks assessments; The 50% inhibition concentration (IC50); Toxic effect; Bioaccumulation; organic compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; bioaccumulation; chemical pollutant; concentration (composition); inhibition; literature review; phytotoxicity; reactive oxygen species; bioaccumulation; biochemical analysis; biological activity; carbon metabolism; cell function; cell organelle; cell structure; concentration (parameter); contamination; environmental exposure; gene; gene expression; IC50; metabolic regulation; metabolic reprogramming; metallothionein gene; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; oxidative stress; phenotype; photosynthesis; phytotoxicity; plant; plant cell; plant growth; plant stress; protein synthesis; Review; toxicity testing; bioaccumulation; ecosystem; plant; water pollutant; Bioaccumulation; Ecosystem; Fluorocarbons; Plants; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier Ltd
Multi-parameter risk assessment of forty-one selected substances with endocrine disruptive properties in surface waters worldwide,"Grobin A., Roškar R., Trontelj J.",2022,Chemosphere,"The increasing use of substances with endocrine disruptive properties (EDs) not only impacts aquatic organisms but can also have a direct negative effect on human health. In this comprehensive worldwide review, we collected ecotoxicology and concentration data observed in surface water for 53 high-potency EDs and performed a risk assessment. The compounds were selected from the EU watchlist of priority substances, expanded with new compounds of emerging concern (total 41), where quantifiable data were available for the past three years (2018–2020). The risk quotients ranged from <0.01 for 22 substances to 1974 for tamoxifen. The frequency of samples in which the predicted no-effect concentrations were exceeded also varied, from 1.8% to 92.7%. By using the comprehensive multi-parameter risk assessment in our study, the most current to date, we determined that tamoxifen, imidacloprid, clothianidin, four bisphenols (BPA, BPF, BPS, and BPAF), PFOA, amoxicillin, and three steroid hormones (estriol, estrone, and cyproterone) pose significant risks in the environment. Comparing two structurally very similar bisphenols, BPA and BPB, suggested that the risk from BPB is currently underestimated by at least four orders of magnitude due to the lack of ecotoxicological data availability. The methodological limitations encountered suggest that a standardized methodology for data selection and assessment is necessary, highlighting the fact that some substances are currently under-represented in the field of ecotoxicological research. A new prioritization system is therefore presented, which provides a potential basis for new substances to be included in environmental monitoring lists. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Ecotoxicology; Endocrine disruptors; Multi-parameter risk assessment; Priority index; Surface water,Aquatic organisms; Ecology; Endocrine disrupters; Endocrinology; Phenols; Steroid hormones; Surface waters; Bisphenols; Eco-toxicology; Ecotoxicological; Endocrine-disruptors; Multi-parameter risk assessment; Multiparameters; Priority index; Property; Risks assessments; Tamoxifen; Risk assessment; acetamiprid; amoxicillin; androstenedione; azithromycin; bazedoxifene; beta lactam antibiotic; ciprofloxacin; clarithromycin; clomifene; clothianidin; corticosterone; cyproterone; desogestrel; endocrine disruptor; erythromycin; estradiol; estriol; estrone; ethinylestradiol; gentamicin; imidacloprid; macrolide; metaflumizone; methiocarb; ospemifene; perfluorooctanoic acid; pesticide; phenol derivative; progesterone; quinolone derivative; raloxifene; surface water; tamoxifen; testosterone; thiacloprid; thiamethoxam; tibolone; tobramycin; toremifene; unclassified drug; endocrine disruptor; ecotoxicology; endocrine disruptor; environmental monitoring; methodology; risk assessment; secondary metabolite; surface water; acute toxicity; aquatic environment; aquatic species; Article; data availability; ecotoxicology; effective concentration; environmental monitoring; geographic distribution; health hazard; information retrieval; no-observed-effect concentration; peer review; persistent organic pollutant; publication; risk assessment; sampling; Scopus; search engine; surface property; Web of Science; ecotoxicology; human; Aquatic Organisms; Ecotoxicology; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Risk Assessment,Elsevier Ltd
Identification of partial denitrification granulation enhanced by low C/N ratio in the aspect of metabolomics and quorum sensing,"Ma C., Zeng W., Meng Q., Wang C., Peng Y.",2022,Chemosphere,"Partial denitrification granular sludge (PDGS) and denitrification granular sludge (DGS) play an important role in nitrogen removal from wastewater. However, the inherent cause of aggregation capacity related to the ratio of COD to nitrogen (COD/N) is still unclear. In this study, metabolomics analysis was combined with microbiological analyses, granular performance and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) structure to explore the granulation mechanism at different influent COD/N ratios. The results showed that the higher COD/N ratio selectively enhanced the gluconeogenesis pathway, purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathway, resulting in more extracellular polysaccharide (PS) excretion and floc sludge. The absence of carbon source weakened tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) reaction, resulting in NAD+ and ADP decrease, nitrite accumulation and change of microbial community structure. The amino acids biosynthesis pathway was enhanced under low COD/N ratio, which promoted the hydrophobicity of EPS. PDGS had stronger Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs)-based quorum sensing (QS) than DGS during the operational period. CO8-HSL, C8-HSL and C6-HSL, as the main form of AHLs, played a dominating role in DGS and PDGS. Batch tests illustrated that adding AHLs obviously improved the synthesis of the amino acids, threonine (Thr), tryptophan (Trp), methionine (Met) and glycine (Gly). Dosing AHLs regulated PS synthesis only at a high COD/N ratio. The glucose-6P, glycerate-3p and UDP-Glc were up-regulated only in DSG, which increased the hydrophilic groups in EPS. The results not only provided the new insights into the metabolism of denitrifying granular sludge, but also indicated the application potential of the technologies regarding start-up and operation of granule sludge. © 2021",Denitrification granular sludge; Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS); Metabolomics; Partial denitrification granular sludge; Quorum sensing (QS),Amino acids; Aspect ratio; Biochemistry; Granular materials; Granulation; Metabolism; Nitrogen removal; Denitrification granular sludge; Extracellular; Extracellular polymeric substance; Granular sludge; Homoserine lactones; Metabolomics; Partial denitrification granular sludge; Polymeric substance; Quorum sensing; Quorum-sensing; Denitrification; denitrification; hydrophobicity; metabolism; microbial community; nitrogen; polysaccharide; sludge; wastewater; gamma butyrolactone derivative; bioreactor; denitrification; metabolomics; quorum sensing; sewage; Acyl-Butyrolactones; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Metabolomics; Quorum Sensing; Sewage,Elsevier Ltd

Elevated levels of perfluoroalkyl substances in breast cancer patients within the Greater Manila Area,"Velarde M.C., Chan A.F.O., Sajo M.E.J.V., Zakharevich I., Melamed J., Uy G.L.B., Teves J.M.Y., Corachea A.J.M., Valparaiso A.P., Macalindong S.S., Cabaluna N.D., Dofitas R.B., Giudice L.C., Gerona R.R.",2022,Chemosphere,"Several studies have reported exposure of humans to various endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) worldwide. However, there is a lack of data regarding EDC exposures in humans living in Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines. Hence, this study measured levels of 41 EDCs in women residing in the Greater Manila Area, home to the second largest city in Southeast Asia. Urine samples from women with versus without breast cancer were analyzed for 11 phthalate metabolites, 8 environmental phenols, and 10 bisphenols, while serum samples were analyzed for 12 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Out of the four groups of EDCs analyzed, PFAS were significantly associated with breast cancer (adjusted OR = 13.63, 95% CI: 3.24–94.88 p-trend = 0.001 for PFDoA; adjusted OR = 9.26, 95% CI 2.54–45.10, p-trend = 0.002 for PFDA; and adjusted OR = 2.66, 95% CI: 0.95–7.66, p-trend = 0.004 for PFHxA). Long-chain PFAS levels were positively correlated with age and were significantly higher in women from Region IV-A, a heavily industrialized region, than from the National Capital Region.

Integrative omics analysis reveals the protective role of vitamin C on perfluorooctanoic acid-induced hepatoxicity,"Li R., Guo C., Lin X., Chan T.F., Su M., Zhang Z., Lai K.P.",2022,Journal of Advanced Research,"Introduction: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a compound used as an industrial surfactant in chemical processes worldwide. Population and cross-sectional studies have demonstrated positive correlations between PFOA levels and human health problems. Objectives: Many studies have focused on the hepatotoxicity and liver problems caused by PFOA, with little attention to remediation of these problems. As an antioxidant, vitamin C is frequently utilized as a supplement for hepatic detoxification. Methods: In this study, we use a mouse model to study the possible role of vitamin C in reducing PFOA-induced liver damage. Based on comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of vitamin C. Results: Our results show that vitamin C supplementation reduces signs of PFOA-induced liver damage including total cholesterol and triglyceride levels increase, liver damage markers aspartate, transaminase, and alanine aminotransferase elevation, and liver enlargement. Further, we show that the protective role of vitamin C is associated with signaling networks control, suppressing linoleic acid metabolism, reducing thiodiglycolic acid, and elevating glutathione in the liver. Conclusion: The findings in this study demonstrate, for the first time, the utility of vitamin C for preventing PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity. © 2021",Liver; Metabolism; Metabolomic; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Vitamin C,ascorbic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; animal; cross-sectional study; mouse; Animals; Ascorbic Acid; Caprylates; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fluorocarbons; Mice,Elsevier B.V.
Recent progress in adsorptive removal of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from water/wastewater,"Vu C.T., Wu T.",2022,Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology,"Due to chemical and physiological inertness and wide usage in nearly every aspect of our daily life, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are now ubiquitous in the environment, including drinking water sources. As most biological and chemical destruction methods have so far shown limited efficiencies, adsorption, a simple and cost-effective treatment, is widely adopted for the removal of PFAS from water/wastewater. This paper aims to review the recent progress in PFAS adsorption using various adsorbents. The performance of different types of adsorbents, including the traditional carbonaceous materials and resins as well as the newly-synthesized minerals, biomaterials, and polymers, in PFAS removal was summarized. Furthermore, the adsorption characteristics and mechanisms were critically reviewed. Real-life adsorption applications (large-scale setups, adsorption-involved treatment trains and point-of-use/point-of-entry systems) were also examined. Learned lessons, current challenges and recommendations on future research were provided regarding results of tests in real environmental matrices, pilot and/or field scale studies of promising newly-developed adsorbents, and the improvement of the removal of alternative PFAS (mostly short-chained ones). © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Adsorption; environmental matrices; large-scale testing; PFAS; short-chained compounds,Adsorption; Biomaterials; Cost effectiveness; Potable water; Water treatment; Adsorption characteristic; Adsorptive removal; Carbonaceous materials; Cost effective treatments; Drinking water sources; Environmental matrixes; Point of use; Recent progress; Driers (materials); adsorption; chemical compound; drinking water; pollutant removal; testing method,Taylor and Francis Ltd.
Progress on the photo aging mechanism of microplastics and related impact factors in water environment [水环境中微塑料的光老化过程及影响因素研究进展],"Wu X., Huang H., Shi Y., Liu P., Wang H., Gao S.",2021,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,"As an emerging pollutant, microplastics (MPs, plastic particles with size < 5 mm) pollution in water has acquired extensive attention in recent years due to their small particle size and stable properties, which can act as a carrier for pollutants in water environment and have toxic hazards to aquatic organisms. After entering into water environment, MPs are readily undergone varied types of weathering processes (i.e., hydrolysis, photo oxidation, mechanical abrasion, and biodegradation), leading to shifted surface morphology (i.e., surface roughness, specific surface area, and size) and physicochemical properties (i.e., melting temperature, surface charge, molecular weight, crystallinity, and hydrophobicity). Among different weathering processes of MPs in water, sunlight induced photo aging process has been considered as primary contributor, which will further impact the MPs behaviors, such as aggregation and deposition in water column, adsorption to organic and inorganic pollutants, leaching of additives, as well as toxicity to organisms in water. From the perspective of MPs aging mechanism, photo aging process of MPs in water environment is a free radical associated chain reaction process and readily to be affected by polymer types, plastic additives, halogen ions, and natural organic matters. These components are generally photochemical activated and prone to involved in the direct or free radical associated indirect photo aging process processed. However, limited information has referred the impact of plastic additives and water constitutes on the long term weathering process for MPs in water, which will pose a great difference between laboratoryaccelerated weathering and long-term natural weathering. Studying the photo aging mechanism of MPs in water environment is of great significance for evaluating their formation process and potential ecological risks. Based on the above considerations, we systematically reviewed the photo aging and fragmentation processes of MPs in water environment. The content of this work contains: (1) Photo aging mechanism and changes of MPs physicochemical properties during aging process in water. Research results revealed that photo aging process could affect the molecular arrangement and mechanical properties of MPs, and further fragment into smaller size secondary MPs even in nano-scale particles, which is important to explain the formation of MPs in current water environment. (2) Critical effect of plastic properties, such as polymer type, size, and plastic additives on the aging of MPs in water; for the impact of plastic additives on the aging process of MPs, results in this work suggested that photo aging mechanism of MPs could be modified due to the presence of plastic additive (i.e., antioxidant and colorant). (3) Role of water constitutes (i.e., Cl-, Br, and NOM) on the photo aging process of MPs in water. The results emphasized the multiple impacts of water constitutes (halogen ions and natural organic matter) in the photo aging process of MPs in the water environment, illustrating that MPs may have different aging time and mechanisms in different water matrices. Moreover, impact of microorganism induced biodegradation for MPs in water is also proposed. In further study, more concentration should be concerned on the combined effects of plastic additives and water quality conditions on the aging process of MPs, which is helpful to shorten the distance between laboratory accelerated weathering and long-term aging process of MPs in natural waters. Besides, results of this paper can also provide theoretical support for comprehensively and systematically assessing the environmental behavior, toxicological effects and ecological risks of aged MPs in natural water environment. © 2021, Science Press.

Exposure to GenX and its novel analogs disrupts fatty acid metabolism in male mice,"Guo H., Sheng N., Guo Y., Wu C., Xie W., Dai J.",2021,Environmental Pollution,"Perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (PFECAs), including hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA, GenX), have been widely used as alternatives to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and subsequently detected in various environmental matrices. Despite this, public information regarding their hepatotoxicity remains limited. Here, to compare the hepatotoxicity of PFECAs and identify better alternatives for GenX, adult male mice were exposed to different concentrations (0.4, 2, and 10 mg/kg/d) of PFOA, GenX, and its analogs (PFMO2HpA and PFMO3NA) for 28 d. Results demonstrated increased hepatomegaly and disturbed fatty acid metabolism with increasing treatment doses. After dimensionality reduction analysis, significant differences were observed in the relative liver weights and liver and serum biochemical parameters among the four clusters. Furthermore, when chemical concentrations in the liver were similar, no differences in the indicators of liver injury associated with fatty acid metabolism were observed among groups in the same clusters. Our results suggest that dimensionality reduction analysis is a useful strategy for analyzing samples exposed to multiple compounds at different doses. Furthermore, PFECAs exhibit similar hepatotoxicities at the same cumulative hepatic concentration in mice with constant body weight, while PFMO2HpA exhibits lower hepatotoxicity compared to GenX at the same dose. © 2021",Dimensionality reduction analysis; Fatty acid metabolism; Hepatotoxicity; PFECAs; PFOA,Chemical analysis; Dimers; Fatty acids; Indicators (chemical); Metabolism; Reduction; Dimensionality reduction analysis; Dimer acids; Environmental matrixes; Exposed to; Fatty acid metabolism; Hepatotoxicity; Hexafluoropropylene oxide; Male mouse; Perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acid; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Mammals; GenX; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; carboxylic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; oxide; body size; concentration (composition); dose-response relationship; enzyme activity; fatty acid; metabolism; rodent; toxicity test; adult; aging; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; biochemical analysis; blood analysis; body weight; comparative study; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental exposure; fatty acid metabolism; hepatomegaly; liver injury; liver toxicity; liver weight; male; mouse; nonhuman; animal; lipid metabolism; Animals; Caprylates; Carboxylic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Hepatomegaly; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Mice; Oxides,Elsevier Ltd
Treatment technologies to mitigate the harmful effects of recalcitrant fluoroquinolone antibiotics on the environ- ment and human health,"Mathur P., Sanyal D., Callahan D.L., Conlan X.A., Pfeffer F.M.",2021,Environmental Pollution,"Antibiotic proliferation in the environment and their persistent nature is an issue of global concern as they induce antibiotic resistance threatening both human health and the ecosystem. Antibiotics have therefore been categorized as emerging pollutants. Fluoroquinolone (FQs) antibiotics are an emerging class of contaminants that are used extensively in human and veterinary medicine. The recalcitrant nature of fluoroquinolones has led to their presence in wastewater, effluents and water bodies. Even at a low concentration, FQs can stimulate antibacterial resistance. The main sources of FQ contamination include waste from pharmaceutical manufacturing industries, hospitals and households that ultimately reaches the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The conventional WWTPs are unable to completely remove FQs due to their chemical stability. Therefore, the development and implementation of more efficient, economical, convenient treatment and removal technologies are needed to adequately address the issue. This review provides an overview of the technologies available for the removal of fluoroquinolone antibiotics from wastewater including adsorptive removal, advanced oxidation processes, removal using non-carbon based nanomaterials, microbial degradation and enzymatic degradation. Each treatment technology is discussed on its merits and limitations and a comparative view is presented on the choice of an advanced treatment process for future studies and implementation. A discussion on the commercialization potential and eco-friendliness of each technology is also included in the review. The importance of metabolite identification and their residual toxicity determination has been emphasized. The last section of the review provides an overview of the policy interventions and regulatory frameworks that aid in retrofitting antibiotics as a central key focus contaminant and thereby defining the discharge limits for antibiotics and establishing safe manufacturing practices. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Adsorptive removal; Advanced materials; Advanced oxidation processes; Enzymatic treatment; Fluoroquinolones; Microbial degradation; Modelling; Regulations; Wastewater,"Biodegradation; Chemical stability; Effluents; Manufacture; Metabolites; Veterinary medicine; Wastewater treatment; Adsorptive removal; Advanced materials; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Enzymatic treatments; Fluoroquinolone antibiotics; Fluoroquinolones; Microbial degradation; Modeling; Regulation; Treatment technologies; Antibiotics; carbon nanotube; graphene; metal organic framework; nanomaterial; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; antiinfective agent; quinolone derivative; adsorption; antibiotics; enzyme; health impact; industrial waste; manufacturing; modeling; oxidation; pharmaceutical industry; technological development; waste technology; wastewater treatment; adsorption; antibiotic resistance; drug contamination; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental policy; enzymatic degradation; human; human impact (environment); manufacturing; microbial degradation; oxidation; process technology; Review; safety; structure analysis; toxicity testing; waste component removal; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; ecosystem; sewage; technology; wastewater; water pollutant; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Ecosystem; Fluoroquinolones; Humans; Technology; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier Ltd
Metabolic syndrome and endocrine disrupting chemicals: An overview of exposure and health effects,"Haverinen E., Fernandez M.F., Mustieles V., Tolonen H.",2021,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is causing a significant health burden among the European population. Current knowledge supports the notion that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) interfere with human metabolism and hormonal balance, contributing to the conventionally recognized lifestyle-related MetS risk factors. This review aims to identify epidemiological studies focusing on the association between MetS or its individual components (e.g., obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension) and eight HBM4EU priority substances (bisphenol A (BPA), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides and heavy metals (cadmium, arsenic and mercury)). Thus far, human biomonitoring (HBM) studies have presented evidence supporting the role of EDC exposures on the development of individual MetS components. The strength of the association varies between the components and EDCs. Current evidence on metabolic disturbances and EDCs is still limited and heterogeneous, and mainly represent studies from North America and Asia, highlighting the need for well-conducted and harmonized HBM programmes among the European population. Rigorous and ongoing HBM in combination with health monitoring can help to identify the most concerning EDC exposures, to guide future risk assessment and policy actions. © 2021 by the authors.

Obesogens in children—an uncharted territory,"Močnik M., Varda N.M.",2021,Metabolites,"Obesogens are exogenous chemicals belonging to the group of endocrine-disrupting chemicals and are believed to interfere in obesity development. In children, several chemicals are under investigation, most commonly bisphenol A, phthalates, perfluorinated alkyl substances, and persistent organic pollutants, including organochlorinated pesticides, tributyltin, polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins. Several associations have been studied between chemical exposure in utero and postnatally. Current opinion among researchers indicates that the obesogen theory is very likely; however, limited published studies show inconsistent support for the obesogenic effects of most substances in children and are limited by difficulty in providing the exact mechanisms of action, nor is their mutual effect in humans known, let alone in children. Existing data indicate that we have only scratched the surface and have much more to learn about obesogens. Hopefully, in the future, more information will provide an opportunity for policy makers to take action and protect public health. © 2021 by the authors.

Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals and Risk of Testicular Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Bräuner E.V., Lim Y.-H., Koch T., Uldbjerg C.S., Gregersen L.S., Pedersen M.K., Frederiksen H., Petersen Jø.H., Coull B.A., Andersson A.-M., Hickey M., Skakkebæk N.E., Hauser R., Juul A.",2021,Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,"The incidence of many hormone-dependent diseases, including testicular cancer, has sharply increased in all high-income countries during the 20th century. This is not fully explained by established risk factors. Concurrent, increasing exposure to antiandrogenic environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in fetal life may partially explain this trend. This systematic review assessed available evidence regarding the association between environmental EDC exposure and risk of testicular cancer (seminomas and nonseminomas). Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of English peer-reviewed literature published prior to December 14, 2020 in the databases PubMed and Embase® was performed. Among the 279 identified records, 19 were eligible for quality assessment and 10 for further meta-analysis. The completeness of reporting was high across papers, but over 50% were considered subject to potential risk of bias. Mean age at diagnosis was 31.9 years. None considered effects of EDC multipollutant mixtures. The meta-analyses showed that maternal exposure to combined EDCs was associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer in male offspring [summary risk ratios: 2.16, (95% CI:1.78-2.62), 1.93 (95% CI:1.49-2.48), and 2.78 (95% CI:2.27-3.41) for all, seminoma, and nonseminoma, respectively]. Similarly, high maternal exposures to grouped organochlorines and organohalogens were associated with higher risk of seminoma and nonseminoma in the offspring. Summary estimates related to postnatal adult male EDC exposures were inconsistent. Maternal, but not postnatal adult male, EDC exposures were consistently associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer, particularly risk of nonseminomas. However, the quality of studies was mixed, and considering the fields complexity, more prospective studies of prenatal EDC multipollutant mixture exposures and testicular cancer are needed. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Paper-based devices as new smart analytical tools for sustainable detection of environmental pollutants,"Colozza N., Caratelli V., Moscone D., Arduini F.",2021,Case Studies in Chemical and Environmental Engineering,"The use of paper as a multifunctional material in electrochemical sensing has been intensively explored over the last decade. The combination among different kinds of paper as well as their coupling with different electrochemical cell configurations have been demonstrated, disclosing innovative sensing performances and features that are still to be fully investigated. This ongoing research has found applications in a variety of fields, including the biomedical, agri-food, security, and environmental ones, thanks to the high versatility and adaptability of the paper material. In this review, we report a critical and comparative analysis of electrochemical devices based on paper published within 2010–2021 and applied for the detection of pollutants of environmental interest in fresh water, seawater, and other real environmental matrices. Several paper types, from common office paper to Whatman filter paper with different filtering grades, were proved to be useful in this field. In detail, the multifarious roles played by the paper are discussed, highlighting how the paper can be a suitable material for electrochemical sensing while being capable of simplifying the measurement of complex real matrices or realizing programmable origami-like structures. Among the most important pollutants, a special focus is dedicated to the emerging pollutants. Furthermore, the unique advantages achieved by the paper have been analyzed and highlighted, reporting the future perspectives regarding the use of this surprising material. © 2021 The Authors",Eco sustainable device; Electrochemical sensor; Emerging pollutant; Environmental monitoring,,Elsevier Ltd
Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in integrated crop–livestock systems: Environmental exposure and human health risks,"Jha G., Kankarla V., McLennon E., Pal S., Sihi D., Dari B., Diaz D., Nocco M.",2021,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are highly persistent synthetic organic contaminants that can cause serious human health concerns such as obesity, liver damage, kidney cancer, hypertension, immunotoxicity and other human health issues. Integrated crop–livestock systems combine agricultural crop production with milk and/or meat production and processing. Key sources of PFAS in these systems include firefighting foams near military bases, wastewater sludge and industrial discharge. Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances regularly move from soils to nearby surface water and/or groundwater because of their high mobility and persistence. Irrigating crops or managing livestock for milk and meat production using adjacent waters can be detrimental to human health. The presence of PFAS in both groundwater and milk have been reported in dairy production states (e.g., Wisconsin and New Mexico) across the United States. Although there is a limit of 70 parts per trillion of PFAS in drinking water by the U.S. EPA, there are not yet regional screening guidelines for conducting risk assessments of livestock watering as well as the soil and plant matrix. This systematic review includes (i) the sources, impacts and challenges of PFAS in integrated crop–livestock systems, (ii) safety measures and protocols for sampling soil, water and plants for determining PFAS concentration in exposed integrated crop–livestock systems and (iii) the assessment, measurement and evaluation of human health risks related to PFAS exposure. © 2021 by the authors.

Endoscopic treatment of obesity and nutritional aspects of bariatric endoscopy,"Král J., Machytka E., Horká V., Selucká J., Doleček F., Špičák J., Kovářová V., Haluzík M., Bužga M.",2021,Nutrients,"Obesity is a significant problem worldwide. Several serious diseases that decrease patient quality of life and increase mortality (high blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes etc.) are associated with obesity. Obesity treatment is a multidisciplinary and complex process that requires maximum patient compliance. Change of lifestyle is fundamental in the treatment of obesity. While pharmacotherapeutic options are available, their efficacy is limited. Surgical treatment though highly effective, carries the risk of complications and is thus indicated mostly in advanced stages of obesity. Endoscopic treatments of obesity are less invasive than surgical options, and are associated with fewer complications and nutritional deficits. Currently, there is a large spectrum of endoscopic methods based on the principles of gastric volume reduction, size restriction and gastric or small bowel bypass being explored with only few available in routine practice. The aim of this publication is to present an up‐to‐date summary of available endoscopic methods for the treatment of obesity focusing on their efficacy, safety and nutritional aspects. © 2021 by the authors.

Emerging pollutants and their removal using visible-light responsive photocatalysis – A comprehensive review,"Ahmed S., Khan F.S.A., Mubarak N.M., Khalid M., Tan Y.H., Mazari S.A., Karri R.R., Abdullah E.C.",2021,Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering,"Emerging pollutants (EP) are the group of contaminants newly detected in aquatic environments around the globe. Conventional water purification systems are less efficient in removing these pollutants; therefore, innovative, and eco-friendly technologies are needed. Recently, semiconductor-supported photocatalysis has attracted attention in environmental remediation for removing EP's owing to their unique characteristics of low-cost, higher thermal and mechanical stability, and excellent pollutant removal efficiency. The charge separation and effective light absorption, particularly in the visible region, are two essential characteristics in photocatalyst which are hard to achieve. Several approaches have been adopted to enhance the charge separation and light-absorption ability in the visible range, including elemental-doping, morphology-engineering, and composite photocatalyst formation. This review concisely discusses the several recently discovered EP's, their fate and transport properties, as well as recent progress in the design and development of visible light-responsive photocatalysts for degradation of EP's. Furthermore, synthesis methods, key features such as optical properties, energy-bandgap structure, crystallinity, and surface features are emphasized in this review. The influencing process parameters, reusability, and stability of photocatalyst are also outlined. Finally, the summary and future perspectives for designing a sustainable photocatalysis system are presented. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Emerging pollutants; Graphene; Heterostructure; MXene; Pesticides visible light; Pharmaceuticals; Photocatalysis,Crystallinity; Heterojunctions; Light; Mechanical stability; Morphology; Optical properties; Photocatalytic activity; Reusability; Semiconductor doping; Water pollution; Water treatment; Aquatic environments; Charge-separation; Eco-friendly technologies; Emerging pollutants; Mxene; Pesticide visible light; Supported photocatalysis; Visible light; Visible-light-responsive; Water purification systems; Light absorption,Elsevier Ltd
"Membrane-based technologies for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) removal from water: Removal mechanisms, applications, challenges and perspectives","Jin T., Peydayesh M., Mezzenga R.",2021,Environment International,"Water purification from per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), as a group of persistent and mobile fluoro-organic contaminants, is receiving increasing attention worldwide due to the ubiquitous presence of these highly toxic compounds. To reduce the risk of exposure of human life to PFASs and their dispersion in the environment, various techniques, primarily based on membrane technologies, have been rapidly developed. Here we critically review and analyze the current state-of-the-art of membrane-based techniques for PFASs removal, including direct membrane filtrations, adsorption-based membranes, and hybrid membrane processes. Membranes performance, treatment efficiencies, characteristic parameters and mechanisms for PFASs removal are discussed in detail. We highlight and discuss advantages and limitations, as well as challenges and prospects of individual membrane-based PFASs treatments, pointing towards the practical and sustainable application of these technologies. © 2021 The Author(s)",Adsorption membrane; Hybrid membrane processes; Mechanisms; Nanofiltration; PFASs; Reverse osmosis,"Membrane technology; Nanofiltration; Osmosis membranes; Water filtration; Adsorption membranes; Hybrid membrane process; Membrane-based; Membrane-based technology; Organic contaminant; Poly-fluoroalkyl substance; Removal mechanism; Toxic compounds; Water purification; Water removal; Reverse osmosis; membrane; nanomaterial; performance assessment; polymer; purification; reverse osmosis; sustainability; ultrafiltration; wastewater treatment; fluorocarbon; water; adsorption; human; water management; water pollutant; Adsorption; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Elsevier Ltd
Tooth biomarkers to characterize the temporal dynamics of the fetal and early-life exposome,"Yu M., Tu P., Dolios G., Dassanayake P.S., Volk H., Newschaffer C., Fallin M.D., Croen L., Lyall K., Schmidt R., Hertz-Piccioto I., Austin C., Arora M., Petrick L.M.",2021,Environment International,"Background: Teeth have unique histology that make this biomatrix a time-capsule for retrospective exposure analysis of fetal and early life. However, most analytic methods require pulverizing the whole tooth, which eliminates exposure timing information. Further, the range of chemicals and endogenous exposures that can be measured in teeth has yet to be fully characterized. Methods: We performed untargeted metabolomics on micro-dissected layers from naturally shed deciduous teeth. Using four liquid-chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry analytical modes, we profiled small molecules (<1000 Da) from prenatal and postnatal tooth fractions. In addition, we employed linear regression on the tooth fraction pairs from 31 children to identify metabolites that discriminate between prenatal and postnatal exposures. Results: Of over 10,000 features measured in teeth dentin, 390 unique compounds were annotated from 62 chemical classes. The class with the largest number of compounds was carboxylic acids and their derivatives (36%). Of the annotated exogenous metabolites (phthalates, parabens, perfluoroalkyl compounds, and cotinine) and endogenous metabolites (fatty acids, steroids, carnitines, amino acids, and others), 91 are linked to 256 health conditions through published literature. Differential analysis revealed 267 metabolites significantly different between the prenatal and the postnatal tooth fractions (adj. p-value < 0.05, Bonferroni correction), and 21 metabolites exclusive to the prenatal fraction. Conclusions: The prenatal and early postnatal exposome revealed from dental biomarkers represents a broad range of endogenous and exogenous metabolites for a comprehensive characterization in environmental health research. Most importantly, this technology provides a direct window into fetal exposures that is not possible by maternal biomarkers. Indeed, we identified several metabolites exclusively in the prenatal fraction, suggesting unique fetal exposures that are markedly different to postnatal exposures. Expansion of databases that include tooth matrix metabolites will strengthen biological interpretation and shed light on exposures during gestation and early life that may be causally linked with later health conditions. © 2021 The Authors",Environment; Exposome; Exposure; Fetal; Metabolomics; Prenatal; Tooth,"Biomarkers; Environmental technology; Fatty acids; Health; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; Earliest life; Environment; Exogenous metabolites; Exposome; Exposure; Fetal; Metabolomics; Postnatal exposure; Prenatal; Tooth; Biomolecules; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; amino acid; aromatic compound; biological marker; carboxylic acid; carboxylic acid derivative; carnitine; cotinine; fatty acid; perfluoroalkyl compound; phthalic acid; steroid; unclassified drug; biological marker; biomarker; histology; metabolism; metabolite; spatiotemporal analysis; tooth; Article; deciduous tooth; dentin; human; human tissue; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; metabolomics; perinatal exposure; prenatal exposure; tooth; child; environmental exposure; female; liquid chromatography; pregnancy; retrospective study; Biomarkers; Child; Chromatography, Liquid; Environmental Exposure; Exposome; Female; Humans; Metabolomics; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies",Elsevier Ltd
Environmental occurrence and remediation of emerging organohalides: A review,"He H., Li Y., Shen R., Shim H., Zeng Y., Zhao S., Lu Q., Mai B., Wang S.",2021,Environmental Pollution,"As replacements for “old” organohalides, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), “new” organohalides have been developed, including decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs), and perfluorobutyrate (PFBA). In the past decade, these emerging organohalides (EOHs) have been extensively produced as industrial and consumer products, resulting in their widespread environmental distribution. This review comprehensively summarizes the environmental occurrence and remediation methods for typical EOHs. Based on the data collected from 2015 to 2021, these EOHs are widespread in both abiotic (e.g., dust, air, soil, sediment, and water) and biotic (e.g., bird, fish, and human serum) matrices. A significant positive correlation was found between the estimated annual production amounts of EOHs and their environmental contamination levels, suggesting the prohibition of both production and usage of EOHs as a critical pollution-source control strategy. The strengths and weaknesses, as well as the future prospects of up-to-date remediation techniques, such as photodegradation, chemical oxidation, and biodegradation, are critically discussed. Of these remediation techniques, microbial reductive dehalogenation represents a promising in situ remediation method for removal of EOHs, such as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Dehalogenation; Emerging organohalides; HFRs; PFASs; POPs; Remediation,"Biodegradation; Consumer products; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Remediation; Decabromodiphenyl ethane; Emerging organohalide; Environmental occurrence; Environmental remediation; Halogenated flame retardant; Organohalides; Polybrominated diphenylethers; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; POP; Remediation methods; Flame retardants; 1 (1,2 dibromoethyl) 3,4 dibrom ocyclohexane; 1,2 bis (2,4,6 tribromophenoxy)ethane; 2 ethylhexyl 2,3,4,5 tetrabromobenzoic acid; bis(2 ethylhexyl)tetrabromophthalate; bisphenol A hexafluoride; decabromodiphenyl ethane; dechlorane plus; hexabromobenzene; hexabromocyclododecane; medium chain chlorinated paraffin; organohalogen derivative; pentabromoethylbenzene; pentabromotoluene; perfluorobutanesulfonic acid; perfluorobutyric acid; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; short chain chlorinated paraffin; tetrabromobisphenol A; triclosan; tris(1 chloro 2 propyl)phosphate; tris(1,3 dichloroisopropyl)phosphate; unclassified drug; water; diphenyl ether derivative; flame retardant; paraffin; polychlorinated biphenyl; abiotic factor; biotic factor; flame retardant; halide; halogen; persistent organic pollutant; pollution control; remediation; air; alkaline hydrothermal reaction; Article; biodegradation; bioremediation; bird; boiling point; chemical degradation; chemical oxidation; concentration (parameter); contamination; dust; electrochemical degradation; fish; human; LD50; melting point; microbial reductive dehalogenation; molecular formula; molecular weight; nanoscale zero valent iron reduction; nonhuman; ozonation; photodegradation; physical chemistry; sediment; serum; soil; sonochemical degradation; vapor pressure; water solubility; animal; environmental monitoring; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Flame Retardants; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Paraffin; Polychlorinated Biphenyls",Elsevier Ltd
"Effect of exogenous N-acyl-homoserine lactones on the anammox process at 15 ℃: Nitrogen removal performance, gene expression and metagenomics analysis","Liu L., Xu S., Wang F., Yan Z., Tian Z., Ji M.",2021,Bioresource Technology,"In this study, C6-HSL and C8-HSL were separately introduced into anammox biofilm reactors to facilitate the anammox performance at 15 ℃. After operation 138 d, total nitrogen removal efficiencies in reactors with amendment C6-HSL or C8-HSL at 15 ℃ reached 76.2% and 74.6%, respectively. Content of extracellular polymeric substances increased by 19.8%, 67.7% and 121.2% in control group, C6-HSL and C8-HSL addition group, respectively. Genes associated with nitrogen removal (i.e., hzo, hzsB, nirS, and ccsB) showed higher expression level at amendment C6-HSL or C8-HSL group. Metagenomics analysis found that amendment of C6-HSL or C8-HL resulted in an increased abundance of genes related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, and also genes associated with amino acid biosynthesis pathways. Overall, amendment C6-HSL or C8-HSL had been confirmed as the effective method to improve the performance of anammox bioreactor at 15 ℃. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Anammox; Co-occurrence network analysis; Low temperature; Metagenomes; N-acyl-homoserine lactones,Biochemistry; Electric network analysis; Gene expression; Nitrogen removal; Temperature; Wastewater treatment; ANAMMOX; Biofilm reactor; Co-occurrence network analyse; Gene expression analysis; Lows-temperatures; Metagenomes; Metagenomic analysis; N-Acyl Homoserine lactones; Removal performance; Esters; amino acid; aminosugar; n acylhomoserine lactone; nitrogen; nucleotide; sugar; tricarboxylic acid; gamma butyrolactone; gamma butyrolactone derivative; amino acid; ammonium compound; biofilm; bioreactor; gene expression; genomics; nitrogen; oxidation; performance assessment; pollutant removal; anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Article; biosynthesis; gene expression; genetic association; low temperature; metabolism; metagenome; metagenomics; microbial community; network analysis; nonhuman; denitrification; gene expression; metagenomics; quorum sensing; 4-Butyrolactone; Acyl-Butyrolactones; Denitrification; Gene Expression; Metagenomics; Nitrogen; Quorum Sensing,Elsevier Ltd
"Absorption separation of fluorinated refrigerant gases with ionic liquids: Equilibrium, mass transport, and process design","Asensio-Delgado S., Pardo F., Zarca G., Urtiaga A.",2021,Separation and Purification Technology,"Interest in recovering and reclaiming refrigerant gases is growing as a consequence of increasing concern about the high global warming potential of some hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). However, advanced separation processes, like extractive distillation, are required to selectively separate azeotropic and close-boiling refrigerant mixtures. In this regard, ionic liquids (ILs) arise as promising entrainers because of their favorable properties, including nonvolatility and good HFC solubility selectivity. The aim of this review is to become a reference text for the research and design of novel separation processes for mixtures of fluorinated gases based on the use of ILs. We include an extensive compilation of publications on equilibrium, mass transport, and absorption and membrane separation related to the use of ILs to selectively separate, not only the most relevant refrigerants employed nowadays, namely, HFCs, hydrofluoroolefins, and hydrochlorofluoroolefins, but also other relevant refrigerant families, such as chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons. The UC-RAIL database provided as Supplementary Information compiles more than 5000 data points that are comprehensively analyzed in the review focusing on process design. Finally, we provide a set of directions that lead to the recovery of fluorinated refrigerant gases, to shift the refrigeration and air conditioning sector towards a more circular economy. © 2021 The Author(s)",Diffusivity; Hydrofluorocarbons; Hydrofluoroolefins; Ionic liquids; Membrane separation; Solubility,Air conditioning; Design; Diffusion; Distillation; Fluorocarbons; Gas permeable membranes; Gases; Global warming; Ionic liquids; Mixtures; Process design; Solubility; Close-boiling; Extractive distillation; Global warming potential; Hydrofluorocarbons; Hydrofluoroolefin; Liquid equilibrium; Membrane separation; Refrigerant gas; Refrigerants mixtures; Separation process; Refrigerants,Elsevier B.V.
The relationship between maternal perfluoroalkylated substances exposure and low birth weight of offspring: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Cao T., Qu A., Li Z., Wang W., Liu R., Wang X., Nie Y., Sun S., Zhang X., Liu X.",2021,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Some studies have shown that maternal perfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS) exposure may be associated with low birth weight (LBW) of offspring. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the association between maternal PFASs exposure and LBW in offspring. The researchers searched PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Embase to find all the articles before October 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the studies. Finally, six articles were included for meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis showed no significant correlation between maternal perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure and LBW of offspring: odds ratio (OR) = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.80–1.01, with low heterogeneity (I2 = 18.4%, P = 0.289); there was a significant positive correlation between maternal perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure and LBW of offspring (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.09–1.55) with no heterogeneity (I2 = 0.00%, P = 0.570). The grouping analysis of PFOS showed was a significant positive correlation between maternal PFOS exposure and LBW of offspring in American (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.15–1.72). This study provided a systematic review and meta-analysis evidence for the relationship between maternal PFASs exposure and LBW of offspring through a small number of studies.

The association between maternal perfluoroalkyl substances exposure and early attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Qu A., Cao T., Li Z., Wang W., Liu R., Wang X., Nie Y., Sun S., Liu X., Zhang X.",2021,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Some studies have shown that maternal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may be associated with early attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to verify this association by reviewing existing studies and to provide a strong basis for preventing ADHD. The researchers searched electronic databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Embase for all studies published before October 2020. Finally, we included nine articles for analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that maternal exposure to PFASs was not significantly associated with the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD (perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), odds ratio (OR) = 1.00, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.75–1.25; perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.88–1.14; perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.80–1.09; perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.99–1.28; perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.15–2.32). Due to significant heterogeneity, we subsequently performed subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. Through subgroup analysis, we found that PFOS concentration of children’s blood and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD were statistically positively correlated, and there was also a positive correlation between PFOS exposure and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD in the America. Moreover, there was also a statistically positive correlation between PFNA concentration in maternal blood and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD. Sensitivity analysis showed that the final results did not change much, the sensitivity was low, and the results were relatively stable. In conclusion, a causal relationship between maternal PFASs exposure and ADHD in children was unlikely. Among them, PFOS, PFNA, and ADHD might have positive associations worthy of further investigation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Children; Maternal exposure; Meta-analysis; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Systematic review,"blood; chemical substance; child health; confidence interval; disease prevalence; meta-analysis; Central America; North America; South America; Scopus; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; adverse event; attention deficit disorder; child; female; human; maternal exposure; meta analysis; pollutant; preschool child; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Child; Child, Preschool; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Maternal Exposure",Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
Probiotic intervention mitigates the metabolic disturbances of perfluorobutanesulfonate along the gut-liver axis of zebrafish,"Hu C., Liu M., Tang L., Liu H., Sun B., Chen L.",2021,Chemosphere,"Probiotic supplementation is effective to modulate the metabolic disorders caused by perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS). However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To this end, the present study exposed adult zebrafish to PFBS (0 and 10 μg/L), probiotics, or their binary combinations for 40 days. After the exposure, the nutritional stores, intestinal organization, and metabolic activities along the gut-liver axis were investigated. The results showed that PFBS exposure decreased the nutrient reserves significantly, especially the lipid content, which was alleviated by the probiotic administration. Intestinal mucus secretion was promoted remarkably in the presence of the probiotic, which enhanced epithelial protection against PFBS damage. Metagenomic analysis showed that PFBS alone induced gut microbial dysbiosis, which was efficiently antagonized by the probiotic bacteria. Intestinal metabolomic profiling revealed that ferroptosis occurred because of the unrestricted lipid peroxidation following PFBS exposure. However, probiotic administration prevented the ferroptotic symptoms induced by PFBS, further highlighting the beneficial effects of the probiotic on the host. In PFBS-exposed livers, high levels of bile acid metabolites (e.g., taurochenodeoxycholic acid) accumulated, implying the induction of cholestasis. Notably, probiotic addition recovered the metabolomic homeostasis under PFBS stress, probably resulting from the activation of detoxification pathways based on the pentose and glucuronate interconversion. Overall, the present study provides systematic evidence of the antagonistic interaction between PFBS and the probiotic regarding the metabolic activities along the microbe, gut and liver axis, highlighting the application values of probiotic recipe in aquaculture industry and ecological reservation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Antagonistic interaction; Gut-liver axis; Microbiome; PFBS; Probiotic,Aquaculture; Bacteria; Body fluids; Detoxification; Metabolism; Metabolites; Antagonistic interactions; Binary combinations; Gut-liver axis; Lipid content; Metabolic activity; Metabolic disorders; Microbiome; Perfluorobutanesulphonate; Probiotics; Zebrafish; Probiotics; bile acid; glucuronic acid; lipid; organofluorine derivative; pentose; perfluorobutanesulfonic acid; probiotic agent; sulfonic acid derivative; taurochenodeoxycholic acid; unclassified drug; lipid; probiotic agent; activation energy; cyprinid; detoxification; digestive system; genetic analysis; homeostasis; induced response; lipid; mucus; secretion; symptom; adult; animal experiment; animal tissue; aquaculture; Article; cholestasis; controlled study; detoxification; drug potency; dysbiosis; feed conversion ratio; ferroptosis; gastrointestinal tract; homeostasis; host pathogen interaction; intestine; intestine flora; intestine injury; intestine tissue; lipid peroxidation; liver; male; metabolic disorder; metabolic fingerprinting; metagenomics; mucus secretion; nonhuman; nutrient; nutritional status; physiological stress; zebra fish; animal; liver; metabolomics; Danio rerio; Animals; Lipids; Liver; Metabolomics; Probiotics; Zebrafish,Elsevier Ltd
The short-term effectiveness and safety of second-generation patellofemoral arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty on isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Li C., Li Z., Shi L., Gao F., Sun W.",2021,Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research,"Background: We aimed to compare second-generation patellofemoral arthroplasty (2G PFA) with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in treating isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) by assessing the percentages of revisions, complications, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Methods: Studies that compared the outcomes of 2G PFA and TKA in the treatment of isolated PFOA were searched in electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. Two researchers independently identified eligible studies, extracted the data, and evaluated the quality of the literature. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) or weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using either fixed or random effects models. Descriptive analysis was used when data could not be pooled. Results: A total of six studies were included in the review. For the revision percentage and complications, there were no significant differences between 2G PFA and TKA (RR = 2.29, 95% CI 0.69–7.58, P = 0.17; RR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.23–1.40, P = 0.22, respectively). Second, the results demonstrated that the differences in the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score between 2G PFA and TKA were not significant (WMD −4.68, 95% CI −16.32 to 6.97, p = 0.43; WMD 0.16, 95% CI −1.21 to 1.53, P = 0.82). The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the American Knee Society Score (AKSS), and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were presented in a narrative form due to methodological heterogeneity. Conclusion: For isolated PFOA, 2G PFA demonstrated similar results to TKA with respect to the percentages of revisions, complications, and PROMs. © 2021, The Author(s).",Isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis; Second-generation patellofemoral arthroplasty; Total knee arthroplasty,"adverse event; arthroplasty; comparative study; female; human; knee osteoarthritis; knee replacement; male; meta analysis; patellofemoral joint; patient-reported outcome; postoperative complication; procedures; reoperation; safety; time factor; treatment outcome; Arthroplasty; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Female; Humans; Male; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Patellofemoral Joint; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Postoperative Complications; Reoperation; Safety; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",BioMed Central Ltd
Identification of key methylation differentially expressed genes in posterior fossa ependymoma based on epigenomic and transcriptome analysis,"Wang G., Jia Y., Ye Y., Kang E., Chen H., Wang J., He X.",2021,Journal of Translational Medicine,"Background: Posterior fossa ependymoma (EPN-PF) can be classified into Group A posterior fossa ependymoma (EPN-PFA) and Group B posterior fossa ependymoma (EPN-PFB) according to DNA CpG island methylation profile status and gene expression. EPN-PFA usually occurs in children younger than 5 years and has a poor prognosis. Methods: Using epigenome and transcriptome microarray data, a multi-component weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to systematically identify the hub genes of EPN-PF. We downloaded two microarray datasets (GSE66354 and GSE114523) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The Limma R package was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and ChAMP R was used to analyze the differential methylation genes (DMGs) between EPN-PFA and EPN-PFB. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using the Metascape database. Results: GO analysis showed that enriched genes were significantly enriched in the extracellular matrix organization, adaptive immune response, membrane raft, focal adhesion, NF-kappa B pathway, and axon guidance, as suggested by KEGG analysis. Through WGCNA, we found that MEblue had a significant correlation with EPN-PF (R = 0.69, P = 1 × 10–08) and selected the 180 hub genes in the blue module. By comparing the DEGs, DMGs, and hub genes in the co-expression network, we identified five hypermethylated, lower expressed genes in EPN-PFA (ATP4B, CCDC151, DMKN, SCN4B, and TUBA4B), and three of them were confirmed by IHC. Conclusion: ssGSEA and GSVA analysis indicated that these five hub genes could lead to poor prognosis by inducing hypoxia, PI3K-Akt-mTOR, and TNFα-NFKB pathways. Further study of these dysmethylated hub genes in EPN-PF and the pathways they participate in may provides new ideas for EPN-PF treatment. © 2021, The Author(s).",Differential genes; Epigenome; Posterior fossa ependymoma; Transcriptome; WGCNA,immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; mammalian target of rapamycin; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; tumor necrosis factor; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; transcriptome; adaptive immunity; Akt signaling; Article; ATP4B gene; axon guidance; CCDC151 gene; clinical article; controlled study; differential gene expression; DMKN gene; DNA methylation; ependymoma; epigenetics; focal adhesion; gene; gene identification; gene set enrichment analysis; gene set variation analysis; genetic analysis; genetic database; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; microarray analysis; NF kB signaling; posterior cranial fossa tumor; posterior fossa ependymoma; prognosis; SCN4B gene; software; TNF signaling; transcriptomics; TUBA4B gene; weighted gene co expression network analysis; child; epigenetics; gene expression profiling; genetics; methylation; Child; Ependymoma; Epigenomics; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Methylation; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Transcriptome,BioMed Central Ltd
The efficacy and safety of fast track surgery (FTS) in patients after hip fracture surgery: a meta-analysis,"Jiang M., Liu S., Deng H., Liang X., Bo Z.",2021,Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research,"Background: Fast track surgery (FTS) has been gradually applied in perioperative management of orthopedic surgery, but there still some research suspected that the prognosis of patients is not as expected and the cost is high, the effect of the FTS still urgently needed for support by evidence-based medicine. Methods: We retrieved RCTs from medical research literature databases. Risk ratios (RR), standard mean difference (SMD), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to compare the primary and safety endpoints. Results: Overall, a total of 8886 patients were retrieved from 57 articles, of which 4448 patients (50.06%) were randomized to experimental group whereas 4438 patients (49.94%) were randomized to control group. The result showed that FTS could significantly shorten the length of stay (LOS), decrease the visual analog scale (VAS), reduce the leaving bed time and the hospitalization costs, and improve Harris hip joint function score. The incidence of complications such as respiratory system infection, urinary system infection, venous thrombus embolism (VTE), pressure sore, incision infection, constipation, and prosthesis dislocation also has been decreased significantly. Meanwhile, FTS improved patients’ satisfaction apparently. Conclusions: This meta-analysis reveals that FTS could significantly shorten the length of stay, alleviate the pain, reduce the leaving bed time and the hospitalization costs, and improve hip function. The incidence of complications also has been decreased significantly. Meanwhile, FTS has been spoken highly in patients in terms of nursing satisfaction. Its efficacy and safety were proved to be reliable. © 2021, The Author(s).",Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS); Fast track surgery (FTS); Hip replacement; Meta-analysis,"convalescence; economics; evidence based medicine; female; hip fracture; hospitalization; human; length of stay; male; meta analysis; pathophysiology; patient satisfaction; postoperative complication; postoperative pain; Enhanced Recovery After Surgery; Evidence-Based Medicine; Female; Hip Fractures; Hospitalization; Humans; Length of Stay; Male; Pain, Postoperative; Patient Satisfaction; Postoperative Complications; Recovery of Function",BioMed Central Ltd
Structure-dependent absorption of atypical sphingoid long-chain bases from digestive tract into lymph,"Mikami D., Sakai S., Nishimukai M., Yuyama K., Mukai K., Igarashi Y.",2021,Lipids in Health and Disease,"Background: Dietary sphingolipids have various biofunctions, including skin barrier improvement and anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinoma properties. Long-chain bases (LCBs), the essential backbones of sphingolipids, are expected to be important for these bioactivities, and they vary structurally between species. Given these findings, however, the absorption dynamics of each LCB remain unclear. Methods: In this study, five structurally different LCBs were prepared from glucosylceramides (GlcCers) with LCB 18:2(4E,8Z);2OH and LCB 18:2(4E,8E);2OH moieties derived from konjac tuber (Amorphophallus konjac), from GlcCers with an LCB 18(9Me):2(4E,8E);2OH moiety derived from Tamogi mushroom (Pleurotus cornucopiae var. citrinopileatus), and from ceramide 2-aminoethyphosphonate with LCB 18:3(4E,8E,10E);2OH moiety and LCB 18(9Me):3(4E,8E,10E);2OH moiety derived from giant scallop (Mizuhopecten yessoensis), and their absorption percentages and metabolite levels were analyzed using a lymph-duct-cannulated rat model via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) with a multistage fragmentation method. Results: The five orally administered LCBs were absorbed and detected in chyle (lipid-containing lymph) as LCBs and several metabolites including ceramides, hexosylceramides, and sphingomyelins. The absorption percentages of LCBs were 0.10–1.17%, depending on their structure. The absorption percentage of LCB 18:2(4E,8Z);2OH was the highest (1.17%), whereas that of LCB 18:3(4E,8E,10E);2OH was the lowest (0.10%). The amount of sphingomyelin with an LCB 18:2(4E,8Z);2OH moiety in chyle was particularly higher than sphingomyelins with other LCB moieties. Conclusions: Structural differences among LCBs, particularly geometric isomerism at the C8–C9 position, significantly affected the absorption percentages and ratio of metabolites. This is the first report to elucidate that the absorption and metabolism of sphingolipids are dependent on their LCB structure. These results could be used to develop functional foods that are more readily absorbed. © 2021, The Author(s).",Lipid metabolism; Lipidomics; Long-chain base; Lymphatic absorption; Sphingolipids; Sphingomyelin,"ceramide 2 aminoethyphosphonate; ceramide derivative; glucosylceramide; hexosylceramide; long chain fatty acid; sphingomyelin; unclassified drug; ceramide; sphingolipid; sphingomyelin; absorption; Amorphophallus konjac; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; digestive system; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; lymph; male; Mizuhopecten yessoensis; nonhuman; Pleurotus; Pleurotus cornucopiae; protein structure; rat; animal; chemistry; dietary supplement; drug effect; gastrointestinal tract; genetics; human; liquid chromatography; lymph; metabolism; tandem mass spectrometry; Animals; Ceramides; Chromatography, Liquid; Dietary Supplements; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Lymph; Pleurotus; Rats; Sphingolipids; Sphingomyelins; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",BioMed Central Ltd
Endocrine disrupting chemicals and thyroid cancer: An overview,"Alsen M., Sinclair C., Cooke P., Ziadkhanpour K., Genden E., van Gerwen M.",2021,Toxics,"Endocrine disruptive chemicals (EDC) are known to alter thyroid function and have been associated with increased risk of certain cancers. The present study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of available studies on the association between EDC exposure and thyroid cancer. Relevant studies were identified via a literature search in the National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health PubMed as well as a review of reference lists of all retrieved articles and of previously published relevant reviews. Overall, the current literature suggests that exposure to certain congeners of flame retardants, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and phthalates as well as certain pesticides may potentially be associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. However, future research is urgently needed to evaluate the different EDCs and their potential carcinogenic effect on the thyroid gland in humans as most EDCs have been studied sporadically and results are not consistent. © 2021 by the authors.

Enhancement of polyhydroxyalkanoate production by co-feeding lignin derivatives with glycerol in Pseudomonas putida KT2440,"Xu Z., Pan C., Li X., Hao N., Zhang T., Gaffrey M.J., Pu Y., Cort J.R., Ragauskas A.J., Qian W.-J., Yang B.",2021,Biotechnology for Biofuels,"Background: Efficient utilization of all available carbons from lignocellulosic biomass is critical for economic efficiency of a bioconversion process to produce renewable bioproducts. However, the metabolic responses that enable Pseudomonas putida to utilize mixed carbon sources to generate reducing power and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) remain unclear. Previous research has mainly focused on different fermentation strategies, including the sequential feeding of xylose as the growth stage substrate and octanoic acid as the PHA-producing substrate, feeding glycerol as the sole carbon substrate, and co-feeding of lignin and glucose. This study developed a new strategy—co-feeding glycerol and lignin derivatives such as benzoate, vanillin, and vanillic acid in Pseudomonas putida KT2440—for the first time, which simultaneously improved both cell biomass and PHA production. Results: Co-feeding lignin derivatives (i.e. benzoate, vanillin, and vanillic acid) and glycerol to P. putida KT2440 was shown for the first time to simultaneously increase cell dry weight (CDW) by 9.4–16.1% and PHA content by 29.0–63.2%, respectively, compared with feeding glycerol alone. GC–MS results revealed that the addition of lignin derivatives to glycerol decreased the distribution of long-chain monomers (C10 and C12) by 0.4–4.4% and increased the distribution of short-chain monomers (C6 and C8) by 0.8–3.5%. The 1H–13C HMBC, 1H–13C HSQC, and 1H–1H COSY NMR analysis confirmed that the PHA monomers (C6–C14) were produced when glycerol was fed to the bacteria alone or together with lignin derivatives. Moreover, investigation of the glycerol/benzoate/nitrogen ratios showed that benzoate acted as an independent factor in PHA synthesis. Furthermore, 1H, 13C and 31P NMR metabolite analysis and mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics measurements suggested that the addition of benzoate stimulated oxidative-stress responses, enhanced glycerol consumption, and altered the intracellular NAD+/NADH and NADPH/NADP+ ratios by up-regulating the proteins involved in energy generation and storage processes, including the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway, the reductive TCA route, trehalose degradation, fatty acid β-oxidation, and PHA biosynthesis. Conclusions: This work demonstrated an effective co-carbon feeding strategy to improve PHA content/yield and convert lignin derivatives into value-added products in P. putida KT2440. Co-feeding lignin break-down products with other carbon sources, such as glycerol, has been demonstrated as an efficient way to utilize biomass to increase PHA production in P. putida KT2440. Moreover, the involvement of aromatic degradation favours further lignin utilization, and the combination of proteomics and metabolomics with NMR sheds light on the metabolic and regulatory mechanisms for cellular redox balance and potential genetic targets for a higher biomass carbon conversion efficiency.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2021, The Author(s).",Co-feeding; Glycerol; Lignin derivatives; Polyhydroxyalkanoate; Pseudomonas putida,Bacteria; Benzoic acid; Biochemistry; Biomass; Bioproducts; Carbon; Cobalt compounds; Fatty acids; Feeding; Glycerol; Lignin; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Metabolites; Monomers; Proteins; Proteomics; Bioconversion process; Metabolite analysis; Oxidative stress response; Poly-hydroxyalkanoate; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Quantitative proteomics; Regulatory mechanism; Value added products; Lignocellulosic biomass; biotechnology; experimental study; fermentation; laboratory method; lignin; Bacteria; Benzoic Acid; Biochemistry; Biomass; Carbon; Cobalt Compounds; Pseudomonas putida; Pseudomonas putida KT2440,BioMed Central Ltd
"The concentration of persistent organic pollutants in water resources: A global systematic review, meta-analysis and probabilistic risk assessment","Vasseghian Y., Hosseinzadeh S., Khataee A., Dragoi E.-N.",2021,Science of the Total Environment,"The persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are environmentally stable and highly toxic chemicals that accumulate in living adipose tissue and have a very destructive effect on aquatic ecosystems. To analyze the evolution of the concentration and prevalence of POPs such as α-HCH, β-HCH, γ-HCH, ∑-HCH, Heptachlor, Aldrin, p,p′-DDE, p,p′-DDT, ∑-DDT, and ∑-OCP in water resources, a search between January 01, 1970, to February 10, 2020, was followed using a systematic review and meta-analysis prevalence. Among the 2306 explored articles in the reconnaissance step, 311 articles with 5315 exemplars, 56 countries, and 4 types of water were included in the meta-analysis study. Among all studied POPs, the concentration of p,p′-DDT in water resources was the highest, especially in drinking water resources. The overall rank order based on the concentration and prevalence of POPs were surface water > drinking water > seawater > groundwater. To identify POPs-contaminated areas, the distance from the mean relative to their distribution was considered. The most to the least polluted areas included: South Africa, India, Turkey, Pakistan, Canada, Hong Kong, and China. The highest carcinogenic risk was observed for β-HCH (Turkey and China), followed by α-HCH (Mexico). The highest non-carcinogenic risk was identified for Aldrin (all analyzed countries), followed by Dieldrin (Turkey) and γ-HCH (Mexico). The Monte Carlo analysis (under the assumption that γ-HCH has a normal distribution), the mean obtained was 8.22E−07 for children and 3.83E−07 for adults. This is in accordance with the standard risk assessment approach. In terms of percentiles, the Monte-Carlo approach indicates that 75% of child population is under the 1.07E−06 risk and 95% of adults under 7.35E−06. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Meta-analysis; Persistent organic pollutants; Probabilistic health risk assessment; Uncertainty; Water resources,"Aquatic ecosystems; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Health risks; Insecticides; Monte Carlo methods; Normal distribution; Organic chemicals; Organic pollutants; Potable water; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Surface waters; Carcinogenic risk; Me-xico; Meta-analysis; Organics; Probabilistic health risk assessment; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Systematic Review; Toxic chemicals; Uncertainty; Waters resources; Risk assessment; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; aldrin; alpha hexachlorocyclohexane; beta hexachlorocyclohexane; chlorphenotane; dibenzofuran; dieldrin; drinking water; ground water; heptachlor; hexachlorocyclohexane; lindane; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; sea water; surface water; chlorinated hydrocarbon; chlorphenotane; water; concentration (composition); health risk; literature review; meta-analysis; Monte Carlo analysis; persistent organic pollutant; probability; risk assessment; uncertainty analysis; water resource; Article; carcinogenic activity; health risk assessment; high performance liquid chromatography; liquid liquid extraction; meta analysis; nonhuman; normal distribution; persistent organic pollutant; risk assessment; solid phase extraction; solid phase microextraction; supercritical fluid extraction; systematic review; thermal conductivity; Turkey (republic); uncertainty; water availability; adult; child; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; human; risk assessment; Meleagris gallopavo; Adult; Child; DDT; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Persistent Organic Pollutants; Risk Assessment; Water",Elsevier B.V.
Unravelling the impacts of perfluorooctanoic acid on anaerobic sludge digestion process,"Wang C., Wu L., Zhang Y.-T., Wei W., Ni B.-J.",2021,Science of the Total Environment,"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a type of persistent organic pollutant that has been detected in wastewater treatment systems, subsequently entering the waste activated sludge (WAS) anaerobic digesters. Nevertheless, how PFOA affects the anaerobic digestion of WAS has never been reported till now. In this study, a series of batch digesters were set up to assess the performance of the anaerobic sludge digestion processes with exposures to different levels of PFOA. Experimental results revealed that the increased PFOA concentration (3–60 μg/g-TS) caused the 11.1–19.2% decrease in methane production than the control. Correspondingly, the relative abundances of several key microbes related to acidification (e.g., Longilinea sp.) and methanation (e.g., Methanosaeta sp.) decreased when exposed to PFOA, as demonstrated by microbial community analysis. Further investigations based on modelling and intermediate metabolites analysis confirmed the inhibition of acidification and methanation caused by PFOA, thus decreasing the methane production potential of WAS in anaerobic digestion. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Anaerobic digestion; Methane production; Microbial community; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Waste activated sludge,"Acidification; Metabolites; Methanation; Methane; Microorganisms; Organic pollutants; Sludge digestion; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic digester; Anaerobic sludge digestion; Anaerobics; Digestion process; Methane production; Microbial communities; Organics; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Waste activated sludges; Wastewater treatment system; Anaerobic digestion; acetic acid; biogas; methane; perfluorooctanoic acid; RNA 16S; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; activated sludge; anaerobic digestion; chemical compound; concentration (composition); experimental study; inhibition; methane; microbial community; persistent organic pollutant; water treatment; acidification; Actinobacteria; activated sludge; anaerobic digestion; anaerobic fermentation; anaerobic sludge; Article; Bacteroidetes; Betaproteobacteria; chemical oxygen demand; Chloroflexi; DNA extraction; environmental exposure; Euryarchaeota; hydrolysis; mathematical model; Methanobrevibacter; methanogenesis; Methanosaeta; Methanospirillum; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; photocatalysis; Proteobacteria; pyrosequencing; sludge digestion; solid waste management; Thaumarchaeota; waste water management; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; digestion; sewage; Methanosaeta sp.; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Caprylates; Digestion; Fluorocarbons; Methane; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Elsevier B.V.
Arthroplasty vs proximal femoral nails for unstable intertrochanteric femoral fractures in elderly patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Chen W.-H., Guo W.-X., Gao S.-H., Wei Q.-S., Li Z.-Q., He W.",2021,World Journal of Clinical Cases,"BACKGROUND Proximal femoral nails (PFNs) are the most common method for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric femoral fractures (IFFs), but postoperative bed rest is required. There is a large amount of blood loss during the operation. Osteoporosis in elderly patients may cause nonunion of fractures and other complications. Arthroplasty can give patients early weight bearing and reduce financial burden, but whether it can replace PFNs remains controversial. AIM To compare the clinical outcomes of arthroplasty and PFNs in the treatment of unstable IFFs in elderly patients. METHODS A search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases and included relevant articles comparing arthroplasty and PFN. The search time was limited from January 1, 2005 to November 1, 2020. Two investigators independently screened studies, extracted data and evaluated the quality according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. According to the research results, the fixed effect model or random effect model were selected for analysis. The following outcomes were analyzed: Harris Hip score, mortality, complications, operation time, blood loos, hospital stay, weight-bearing time, fracture classification and type of anesthesia. RESULTS We analyzed four randomized controlled trials that met the requirements. A total of 298 patients were included in these studies. According to the AO/OTA classification, there are 20 A1 types, 136 A2 types, 42 A3 types and 100 unrecorded types. Primary outcome: The Harris Hip Score at the final follow-up of the PFN group was higher [mean difference (MD): 9.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 16.57 to 1.45), P = 0.02]. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the rate of overall mortality [risk ratio (RR): 1.44, P = 0.44] or the number of complications (RR: 0.77, P = 0.05). Secondary outcomes: blood loss of the arthroplasty group was higher (MD: 241.01, 95% CI: 43.06–438.96, P = 0.02); the operation time of the PFN group was shorter (MD: 23.12, 95%CI: 10.46–35.77, P = 0.0003); and the length of hospital stay of the arthroplasty group was shorter [MD: 0.97, 95% CI: 1.29 to 0.66), P<0.00001]. There was no difference between the two groups in the type of anesthesia (RR: 0.99). There were only two studies recording the weight-bearing time, and the time of full weight bearing in the arthroplasty group was significantly earlier. CONCLUSION Compared with PFN, arthroplasty can achieve weight bearing earlier and shorten hospital stay, but it cannot achieve a better clinical outcome. Arthroplasty cannot replace PFNs in the treatment of unstable IFFs in elderly individuals. ©The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Based on the mechanism of olefin formation, four key factors controlling the nature of catalyst functions were reviewed, including active metal/phase, transition metal promoter, alkali promoter, and catalyst support, for improving olefins or aromatics selectivity, while the photocatalytic form as a novel reaction system is also introduced. In the last part, we discussed the challenges in improving product selectivity and catalyst stability, the strategy in catalyst design and catalytic system from a new perspective, the method for understanding the relationship between catalyst structure and catalytic performance, and the potential industrialization for FTO/FTA. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; heterogeneous catalysis; olefin production; SDG7: Affordable and clean energy; syngas conversion,,Elsevier Inc.
Remediation and mineralization processes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in water: A review,"Verma S., Varma R.S., Nadagouda M.N.",2021,The Science of the total environment,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic organic molecules used to manufacture various consumer and industrials products. In PFAS, the CF bond is stable, which renders these compounds chemically stable and prevents their breakdown. Several PFAS treatment processes such as adsorption, photolysis and photocatalysis, bioremediation, sonolysis, electrochemical oxidation, etc., have been explored and are being developed. The present review article has critically summarized degradative technologies and provides in-depth knowledge of photodegradation, electrochemical degradation, chemical oxidation, and reduction mineralization mechanism. Also, novel non-degradative technologies, including nano-adsorbents, natural and surface-modified clay minerals/zeolites, calixarene-based polymers, and molecularly imprinted polymers and adsorbents derived from biomaterials are discussed in detail. Of these novel approaches photocatalysis combined with membrane filtration or electrochemical oxidation via a treatment train approach shows promising results in removing PFAS in natural waters. The photocatalytic mineralization mechanism of PFOA is discussed, leading to recommendations for future research on novel remediation strategies for removing PFAS from water.

Research Progress in Treatment of Antibiotics and Heavy Metals Compound Polluted Wastewater [抗生素与重金属复合污染废水处理的研究进展],"Xu Z., Meng F., Lü Y., Ban Y., Liu J., Zeng H.",2021,Research of Environmental Sciences,"As more and more pollutants enter the environment, the compound pollution of water by antibiotics and heavy metals has attracted the attention of scholars. Based on the analysis of the interaction mechanism between antibiotics and heavy metals, the research progress of the main treatment technologies of wastewater polluted by antibiotics and heavy metals is reviewed, and the mechanism of action and advantages and disadvantages are summarized. The results showed that the interaction between antibiotics and heavy metals was affected by the types of functional groups, the types of heavy metal ions and the pH of the solution. Adsorption is currently the most used method, and photocatalysis and constructed wetland methods have broad application prospects. The modification of flocculant or zero-valent iron can enhance the treatment effect of wastewater with combined antibiotics and heavy metal pollution. The combination of various methods has great potential for treating combined pollution of antibiotics and heavy metals in water. It is recommended that future research should focus on the following aspects: (1) The application of various treatment technologies in actual environmental water bodies; (2) The environmental impact of complex pollution and the formulation and improvement of relevant laws and regulations; (3) The generation mechanism and influencing factors of emerging pollutant resistance genes. © 2021, Editorial Board, Research of Environmental Sciences.

Sediment is an important environmental reservoir for PFOA, while polluted sediment can serve as a long-term contamination source causing pollution to overlying surface water and surrounding groundwater. Here, the source, pollution level, adsorption and transport of PFOA at the sediment-water interface were systematically reviewed. Industrial discharge was the major release for PFOA entering surface water and sediment. PFOA was generally at ng•L-1 and ng•g-1 levels in global surface water and sediment. More serious pollution was found in some parts of China. Sediment composition, hadrochemical condition, natural organic matter, and surfactants could strongly affect PFOA adsorption in sediment, though the controlling mechanisms were controversial. Research on PFOA transport in sediment had just been started with limited progress. There is a great gap in understanding the mechanisms underlying PFOA transport in sediment, which should be strengthened in the future. © 2021, Science Press.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of the perioperative enhanced recovery after surgery concept on the surgical treatment of acute appendicitis in children,"Zhang A., Lu H., Chen F., Wu Y., Luo L., Sun S.",2021,Translational Pediatrics,"Background: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS), as a new concept in surgery, has dramatically changed the mode of perioperative treatment for children with acute appendicitis. Methods: The retrieval strategy developed by the Cochrane Collaboration was conducted using the CNKI database, Wanfang Medical Network, PubMed, EBSCO, Medline, and Cochrane database by combining subject headings and free words. A review of the randomized controlled trials on the use of the ERAS concept in the perioperative treatment of acute appendicitis in children was conducted between the establishment of the database and May 15, 2021. Keywords included enhanced recovery after surgery, fast track surgery, ERAS, FTS, child, infant, and appendicitis. The quality of the literature was evaluated according to the RevMan 5.3 software provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. Results: Five randomized controlled trials on ERAS in children with acute appendicitis were finally included. The heterogeneity of postoperative stay time was tested in 4 studies using continuous variables, with Chi-squared test (Chi2) =221.52, degree of freedom (df) =3, I2=99%>50%. An overall analysis using a random effects model showed that the ERAS group was significantly different compared to the control group [Z=5.26; mean difference (MD) =-1.65; 95% CI: -2.27 to -1.03; P<0.00001]. The heterogeneity of the readmission rate was tested in 5 studies using dichotomous variables, with Chi2=5.11, df =3, I2=41%<50%, P=0.91. Overall analysis using a fixed effects model showed no statistically significant difference between the ERAS group and the control group [Z=0.80; odds ratio (OR) =1.16; 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.66; P=0.42]. The heterogeneity of the recurrence rate was tested in 4 studies using dichotomous variables, with Chi2=3.73, df =3, I2=20%<50%, P=0.29. Overall analysis using a fixed effects model showed no statistically significant difference between the ERAS group and the control group (Z=1.14; OR =0.76; 95% CI: 0.47 to 1.22; P=0.26). Discussion: The results of the meta-analysis confirmed that perioperative application of the ERAS concept in children with acute appendicitis can promote the rehabilitation of children, reduce the postoperative stay time, and reduce the readmission rate and reoperation rate. © 2021 AME Publishing Company.

Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent CRCLM resection at our medical center between 2006 and 2016 were divided into cohorts of “good prognosis” (GP) or “poor prognosis” (PP) based on the time interval between their resection and disease recurrence. Proteomic analysis was performed on the surgical specimen and correlation analysis was carried out with demographics and clinical outcomes. Results: Proteomic analysis revealed 99 differentially expressed proteins of which a third were associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) pathways as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Multivariate analysis yielded a statistically differential proteomic pattern between the cohort regardless of perioperative treatment. Conclusion: Our results indicate a different proteomic landscape in the cohort of patients who had a clinical benefit from CRCLM resection which appears to be correlated with ECM pathways. Further prospective studies are needed to define the role of ECM pathways in prognostics and patient selection for surgical procedures for CRCLM. © 2021 by the authors.

Recent advances in dynamic modeling and process control of pva degradation by biological and advanced oxidation processes: A review on trends and advances,"Lin Y.-P., Dhib R., Mehrvar M.",2021,Environments - MDPI,"Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is an emerging pollutant commonly found in industrial wastewater, owing to its extensive usage as an additive in the manufacturing industry. PVA’s popularity has made wastewater treatment technologies for PVA degradation a popular research topic in industrial wastewater treatment. Although many PVA degradation technologies are studied in bench‐scale processes, recent advancements in process optimization and control of wastewater treatment technologies such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) show the feasibility of these processes by monitoring and controlling processes to meet desired regulatory standards. These wastewater treatment technologies exhibit complex reaction mechanisms leading to nonlinear and nonstationary behavior related to variability in operational conditions. Thus, black‐box dynamic modeling is a promising tool for designing control schemes since dynamic modeling is more complicated in terms of first principles and reaction mechanisms. This study seeks to provide a survey of process control methods via a comprehensive review focusing on PVA degradation methods, including biological and advanced oxidation processes, along with their reaction mechanisms, control‐oriented dynamic modeling (i.e., state‐space, transfer function, and artificial neural network modeling), and control strategies (i.e., proportional‐integral‐derivative control and predictive control) associated with wastewater treatment technologies utilized for PVA degradation. © 2021 by the authors.

Recent advances in biopolymeric membranes towards the removal of emerging organic pollutants from water,"Mamba F.B., Mbuli B.S., Ramontja J.",2021,Membranes,"Herein, this paper details a comprehensive review on the biopolymeric membrane applications in micropollutants’ removal from wastewater. As such, the implications of utilising non-biodegradable membrane materials are outlined. In comparison, considerations on the concept of utilising nanostructured biodegradable polymeric membranes are also outlined. Such biodegradable polymers under considerations include biopolymers-derived cellulose and carrageenan. The advantages of these biopolymer materials include renewability, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and cost-effectiveness when compared to non-biodegradable polymers. The modifications of the biopolymeric membranes were also deliberated in detail. This included the utilisation of cellulose as matrix support for nanomaterials. Furthermore, attention towards the recent advances on using nanofillers towards the stabilisation and enhancement of biopolymeric membrane performances towards organic contaminants removal. It was noted that most of the biopolymeric membrane applications focused on organic dyes (methyl blue, Congo red, azo dyes), crude oil, hexane, and pharmaceutical chemicals such as tetracycline. However, more studies should be dedicated towards emerging pollutants such as micropollutants. The biopolymeric membrane performances such as rejection capabilities, fouling resistance, and water permeability properties were also outlined. © 2021 by the authors.

Micro(nano)plastics as an emerging risk factor to the health of amphibian: A scientometric and systematic review,"Araújo A.P.D.C., Rocha T.L., e Silva D.D.M., Malafaia G.",2021,Chemosphere,"Although the toxicity of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) is recognized at different trophic levels, our know-how about their effects on amphibians is limited. Thus, we present and discuss the current state on studies involving amphibians and plastic particles, based on a broad approach to studies published in the last 5 years. To search for the articles, the ISI Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases were consulted, using different descriptors related to the topic of study. After the systematic search, we identified 848 publications. Of these, 12 studies addressed the relationship “plastic particles and amphibians” (7 studies developed in the laboratory and 5 field studies). The scientometric analysis points to geographic concentration of studies in Brazil and China; low investment in research in the area, and limited participation of international authors in the studies carried out. In the systematic approach, we confirm the scarcity of available data on the toxicity of plastic particles in amphibians; we observed a concentration of studies in the Anura order, only one study explored the toxicological effects of NPs and polystyrene and polyethylene are the most studied plastic types. Moreover, the laboratory tested concentrations are distant from those of the environmentally relevant; and little is known about the mechanisms of action of NPs/MPs involved in the identified (eco)toxicological effects. Thus, we strongly recommend more investments in this area, given the ubiquitous nature of NPs/MPs in aquatic environments and their possible consequences on the dynamics, reproduction, and survival of species in the natural environment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Emerging pollutants; Freshwater environment; Frog; Plastic pollution; Tadpoles; Vertebrates,"Cell proliferation; Health risks; Technology transfer; Toxicity; Emerging pollutants; Freshwater environments; Frog; Micro/nano; Microplastics; Nanoplastics; Plastic particle; Plastic pollutions; Tadpole; Toxicological effects; Pollution; microplastic; polyethylene; polystyrene; plastic; amphibian; laboratory method; nanoparticle; plastic; polymer; risk factor; toxicity; toxicology; Amphibia; Anura; aquatic environment; Brazil; China; field study; health hazard; nonhuman; plastic pollution; Review; risk factor; survival; water pollutant; analysis; animal; risk factor; toxicity; water pollutant; Brazil; China; Amphibia; Scopus; Vertebrata; Animals; Anura; Microplastics; Plastics; Risk Factors; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier Ltd
The degradation mechanisms of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) by different chemical methods: A critical review,"Deng Y., Liang Z., Lu X., Chen D., Li Z., Wang F.",2021,Chemosphere,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a class of artificial compounds comprised of a perfluoroalkyl main chain and a terminal functional group. With them being applied in a wide range of applications, PFASs have drawn increasing regulatory attention and research interests on their reductions and treatments due to their harmful effects on environment and human beings. Among numerous studies, chemical treatments (e.g., photochemical, electrochemical, and thermal technologies) have been proved to be important methods to degradation PFASs. However, the pathways and mechanisms for the degradation of PFASs through these chemical methods still have not been well documented. This article therefore provides a comprehensive review on the degradation mechanisms of two important PFASs (perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)) with photochemical, electrochemical and thermal methods. Different decomposition mechanisms of PFOA and PFOS are reviewed and discussed. Overall, the degradation pathways of PFASs are associated closely with their head groups and chain lengths, and H/F exchange and chain shortening were found to be predominant degradation mechanisms. The clear study on the degradation mechanisms of PFOA and PFOS should be very useful for the complete degradation or mineralization of PFASs in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Degradation mechanisms; Electrochemical; PFOA; PFOS; Photochemical; Thermal treatment,Decomposition; Heat treatment; Chemical method; Critical review; Degradation mechanism; Electrochemicals; Main chains; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Photochemicals; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Thermal; Degradation; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; chemical method; decomposition; degradation; literature review; organic acid; Article; decomposition; electrochemistry; mineralization; photochemistry; photodegradation; thermal analysis; human; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Humans,Elsevier Ltd
Exposure to legacy and novel perfluoroalkyl substance disturbs the metabolic homeostasis in pregnant women and fetuses: A metabolome-wide association study,"Li Y., Lu X., Yu N., Li A., Zhuang T., Du L., Tang S., Shi W., Yu H., Song M., Wei S.",2021,Environment International,"Background: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exist extensively and several of these have been verified to be toxic. Prenatal exposure to PFASs has attracted much attention. Metabolome-wide association analyses can be used to explore the toxicity mechanisms of PFASs by identifying associated biomarkers. Objectives: To evaluate associations between the metabolites in maternal and cord serum and internal exposure to several common PFASs. Methods: Paired maternal and cord serum samples were collected from 84 pregnant women who gave birth between 2015 and 2016. Seven legacy and two novel PFASs were measured. A nontarget metabolomic method and an iterative metabolite annotation based on metabolic pathways were applied to characterize the metabolic profiles. Linear regression adjusted with the false discovery rate and covariates was used to indicate the associations. Results: A total of 279 features in maternal serum and 338 features in cord serum were identified as metabolites associated with PFAS exposure. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) were two PFASs associated with more metabolites, while the two novel chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acids (Cl-PFESAs) showed less relevance to the metabolome. With pathway enrichment analysis, we found that three fatty acid metabolisms and retinol metabolism were correlated with PFAS exposure in maternal blood, and that sterol metabolism showed the correlation in both maternal serum and cord serum. Conclusions: We identified metabolites and pathways in pregnant women and fetuses associated with the exposure to several PFAS, indicating a promising application for metabolome-wide association studies. Additional research is needed to confirm causation. © 2021 The Authors",Fetuses; Metabolomics; Nontarget analysis; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Pregnant women,Body fluids; Fatty acids; Iterative methods; Metabolism; Metabolites; Cord serum; Fetus; Homoeostasis; Maternal serum; Metabolomes; Metabolomics; Non-target analysis; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Pregnant woman; Sulphonic acids; Biomolecules; 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid; 8:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid; environmental marker; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluoroheptane sulfonic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; retinol; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; fatty acid; homeostasis; metabolism; metabolite; serum; toxicity; adult; Article; controlled study; cord serum; disease association; false discovery rate; fatty acid metabolism; female; fetus; homeostasis; human; linear regression analysis; male; maternal blood; maternal exposure; maternal serum; metabolite; metabolome; metabolomics; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prenatal exposure; priority journal; steroidogenesis; sterol metabolism; vitamin metabolism; homeostasis; metabolome; pollutant; pregnant woman; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fetus; Fluorocarbons; Homeostasis; Humans; Metabolome; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women,Elsevier Ltd
"Occurrence, profiles, and ecotoxicity of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances and their alternatives in global apex predators: A critical review","Chen Y., Fu J., Ye T., Li X., Gao K., Xue Q., Lv J., Zhang A., Fu J.",2021,Journal of Environmental Sciences (China),"Certain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exhibit significant bioaccumulation/biomagnification behaviors in ecosystems. PFASs, such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and related precursors, have elicited attention from both public and national regulatory agencies, which has resulted in worldwide restrictions on their production and use. Apex predators occupy the top trophic positions in ecosystems and are most affected by the biomagnification behavior of PFASs. Meanwhile, the long lifespans of apex predators also lead to the high body burden of PFASs. The high body burden of PFASs might be linked to adverse health effects and even pose a potential threat to their reproduction. As seen in previous reviews of PFASs, knowledge is lacking between the current stage of the PFAS body burden and related effects in apex predators. This review summarized PFAS occurrence in global apex predators, including information on the geographic distribution, levels, profiles, and tissue distribution, and discussed the trophic transfer and ecotoxicity of PFASs. In the case where legacy PFASs were restricted under international convention, the occurrence of novel PFASs, such as 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) and perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate (PFECHS), in apex predators arose as an emerging issue. Future studies should develop an effective analytical method and focus on the toxicity and trophic transfer behavior of novel PFASs. © 2021",Apex predators; Biomagnification; Contamination features; Ecological risk; Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs),Biochemistry; Cell proliferation; Ecosystems; Health risks; Adverse health effects; International conventions; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Poly and perfluoroalkyl substance (PFASs); Regulatory agencies; Tissue distributions; Geographical distribution; aliphatic hydrocarbon; bioaccumulation; chemical pollutant; chemical substance; ecological impact; ecotoxicology; food web; pollution incidence; predator; trophic level; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; ecosystem; tissue distribution; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Ecosystem; Fluorocarbons; Tissue Distribution,Chinese Academy of Sciences
"Precision Biotransformation of Emerging Pollutants by Human Cytochrome P450 Using Computational-Experimental Synergy: A Case Study of Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) Phosphate","Chai L., Zhang H., Song R., Yang H., Yu H., Paneth P., Kepp K.P., Akamatsu M., Ji L.",2021,Environmental Science and Technology,"Precision biotransformation is an envisioned strategy offering detailed insights into biotransformation pathways in real environmental settings using experimentally guided high-Accuracy quantum chemistry. Emerging pollutants, whose metabolites are easily overlooked but may cause idiosyncratic toxicity, are important targets of such a strategy. We demonstrate here that complex metabolic reactions of tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) catalyzed by human CYP450 enzymes can be mapped via a three-step synergy strategy: (i) screening the possible metabolites via high-Throughout (moderate-Accuracy) computations; (ii) analyzing the proposed metabolites in vitro by human liver microsomes and recombinant human CYP450 enzymes; and (iii) rationalizing the experimental data via precise mechanisms using high-level targeted computations. Through the bilateral dialogues from qualitative to semi-quantitative to quantitative levels, we show how TDCIPP metabolism especially by CYP3A4 generates bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP) as an O-dealkylation metabolite and bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) 3-chloro-1-hydroxy-2-propyl phosphate (alcoholβ-dehalogen) as a dehalogenation/reduction metabolite via the initial rate-determining H-Abstraction from αC-and βC-positions. The relative yield ratio [dehalogenation/reduction]/[O-dealkylation] is derived from the relative barriers of H-Abstraction at the βC-and αC-positions by CYP3A4, estimated as 0.002 to 0.23, viz., an in vitro measured ratio of 0.04. Importantly, alcoholβ-dehalogen formation points to a new mechanism involving successive oxidation and reduction functions of CYP450, with its precursor aldehydeβ-dehalogen being a key intermediate detected by trapping assays and rationalized by computations. We conclude that the proposed three-step synergy strategy may meet the increasing challenge of elucidating biotransformation mechanisms of substantial synthesized organic compounds in the future. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

GenX is not always a better fluorinated organic compound than PFOA: A critical review on aqueous phase treatability by adsorption and its associated cost,"Heidari H., Abbas T., Ok Y.S., Tsang D.C.W., Bhatnagar A., Khan E.",2021,Water Research,"Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) has been marketed as a substitute for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) to reduce environmental and health risks. GenX and PFOA have been detected in various natural water sources, and adsorption is recognized as a typical treatment process for PFOA removal. In this paper, comparisons of GenX and PFOA adsorption are evaluated, including adsorption potential, adsorption mechanisms, and associated costs. A detailed literature review suggests that anion-exchange resins are more effective in removing GenX than activated carbon. GenX removal efficiency through activated carbon (30%) is lower than that of PFOA (80–95%), while GenX and PFOA removal efficiencies by anion exchange resins are similar (99%). Unconventional adsorbents, such as ionic fluorogels and covalent organic frameworks can effectively remove GenX from water. The review reveals that GenX adsorption is more challenging, requiring almost 4 times the treatment cost of its predecessor, PFOA. Annual operation and maintenance costs for GenX adsorption (initial concentration of GenX and PFOA = 0.2 µg.L−1) by GAC for treating 10,000 m3 per day is almost US$1,000,000 per year, but only around US$240,000 per year for PFOA. Desorption of GenX in the presence of PFOA highlights GenX's inferior treatability by adsorption. It is believed that GenX is a more environmentally friendly compound than PFOA, but this environmental friendliness comes with the price. © 2021",Activated carbon; Drinking water; Emerging contaminants; Remediation technologies; Water treatment,"Activated carbon treatment; Adsorption; Efficiency; Health risks; Ion exchange; Ion exchange resins; Potable water; Remediation; Anion exchange resins; Aqueous phasis; Associated costs; Critical review; Dimer acids; Emerging contaminant; Hexafluoropropylene oxide; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Remediation technologies; Removal efficiencies; Activated carbon; activated carbon; adsorbent; anion exchange resin; beta cyclodextrin; dissolved organic matter; drinking water; hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid; hydrogel; metal organic framework; methyl chloride; molecularly imprinted polymer; organic compound; organofluorine derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; poly [n [3 (dimethylamino)propyl] acrylamide; poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate; polymer; resin; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; water; activated carbon; adsorption; health risk; ion exchange; organic compound; oxide; pollutant removal; adsorption kinetics; controlled study; cost; critical micelle concentration; desorption; hydrogen bond; isotherm; micellization; molecular size; particle size; pH; rate constant; reduction (chemistry); Review; surface area; waste component removal; waste water management; water treatment; adsorption; water pollutant; Adsorption; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier Ltd
"Organic pollutants in deep sea: Occurrence, fate, and ecological implications","Sanganyado E., Chingono K.E., Gwenzi W., Chaukura N., Liu W.",2021,Water Research,"The deep sea - an oceanic layer below 200 m depths – has important global biogeochemical and nutrient cycling functions. It also receives organic pollutants from anthropogenic sources, which threatens the ecological function of the deep sea. In this Review, critically examined data on the distribution of organic pollutants in the deep sea to outline the role of biogeochemical and geophysical factors on the global distribution and regional chemodynamics of organic pollutants in the deep sea. We found that the contribution of deep water formation to the influx of perfluorinated compounds reached a maximum, following peak emission, faster in young deep waters (&lt; 10 years) compared to older deep waters (&gt; 100 years). For example, perfluorinated compounds had low concentrations (&lt; 10 pg L−1) and vertical variations in the South Pacific Ocean where the ocean currents are old (&lt; 1000 years). Steep geomorphologies of submarine canyons, ridges, and valleys facilitated the transport of sediments and associated organic pollutants by oceanic currents from the continental shelf to remote deep seas. In addition, we found that, even though an estimated 1.2–4.2 million metric tons of plastic debris enter the ocean through riverine discharge annually, the role of microplastics as vectors of organic pollutants (e.g., plastic monomers, additives, and attached organic pollutants) in the deep sea is often overlooked. Finally, we recommend assessing the biological effects of organic pollutants in deep sea biota, large-scale monitoring of organic pollutants, reconstructing historical emissions using sediment cores, and assessing the impact of deep-sea mining on the ecosystem. © 2021",Biological pump; Deep sea; Marine pollution; Organochlorine pesticides; Persistent organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls,"Additives; Biogeochemistry; Marine pollution; Ocean currents; River pollution; Anthropogenic sources; Biogeochemical cycling; Biogeochemicals; Biological pumps; Deep sea; Deepwater; Ecological functions; Nutrients cycling; Organochlorine pesticides; Perfluorinated compounds; Organic pollutants; bromine; flame retardant; halide; industrial chemical; microplastic; monomer; organochlorine pesticide; perfluoro compound; polychlorinated biphenyl; plastic; anthropogenic source; deep sea; deep water formation; nutrient cycling; organic pollutant; plastic; river discharge; submarine canyon; bioavailability; biogeochemistry; biota; biotransformation; continental shelf; deep sea; ecology; geomorphology; industrialization; marine environment; microbial kinetics; ocean current; Pacific Ocean; persistent organic pollutant; plastic waste; Review; sea pollution; sediment; urbanization; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; pollutant; sea; water pollutant; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (South); Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Geologic Sediments; Oceans and Seas; Plastics; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier Ltd
Effects of emerging pollutants on the occurrence and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes: A review,"Feng G., Huang H., Chen Y.",2021,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have become major concerns for both public health and environmental ecosystems. Emerging pollutants (EPs) that accumulate in environmental compartments also pose a potential risk for the enrichment of ARGs in indigenous microorganisms. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the effects and intrinsic mechanisms of EPs, including microplastics, engineered nanomaterials, disinfection byproducts, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, on the occurrence and dissemination of ARGs. State-of-the-art methods for identifying culture-independent ARG-host interactions and monitoring horizontal gene transfer (HGT) processes in real-time are first reviewed. The contributions of EPs to the abundance and diversity of ARGs are then summarized. Finally, we discussed the underlying mechanisms related to the regulation of HGT, increased mutagenesis, and the evolution of microbial communities. Further details of three HGT (i.e., conjugation, transformation, and transduction) frequency patterns in response to various EPs are also examined.

Targeting integrated epigenetic and metabolic pathways in lethal childhood PFA ependymomas,"Panwalkar P., Tamrazi B., Dang D., Chung C., Sweha S., Natarajan S.K., Pun M., Bayliss J., Ogrodzinski M.P., Pratt D., Mullan B., Hawes D., Yang F., Lu C., Sabari B.R., Achreja A., Heon J., Animasahun O., Cieslik M., Dunham C., Yip S., Hukin J., Phillips J.J., Bornhorst M., Griesinger A.M., Donson A.M., Foreman N.K., Garton H.J.L., Heth J., Muraszko K., Nazarian J., Koschmann C., Jiang L., Filbin M.G., Nagrath D., Kool M., Korshunov A., Pfister S.M., Gilbertson R.J., David Allis C., Chinnaiyan A.M., Lunt S.Y., Blüml S., Judkins A.R., Venneti S.",2021,Science Translational Medicine,"Childhood posterior fossa group A ependymomas (PFAs) have limited treatment options and bear dismal prognoses compared to group B ependymomas (PFBs). PFAs overexpress the oncohistone-like protein EZHIP (enhancer of Zeste homologs inhibitory protein), causing global reduction of repressive histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), similar to the oncohistone H3K27M. Integrated metabolic analyses in patient-derived cells and tumors, single-cell RNA sequencing of tumors, and noninvasive metabolic imaging in patients demonstrated enhanced glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolism in PFAs. Furthermore, high glycolytic gene expression in PFAs was associated with a poor outcome. PFAs demonstrated high EZHIP expression associated with poor prognosis and elevated activating mark histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac). Genomic H3K27ac was enriched in PFAs at key glycolytic and TCA cycle–related genes including hexokinase-2 and pyruvate dehydrogenase. Similarly, mouse neuronal stem cells (NSCs) expressing wild-type EZHIP (EZHIP-WT) versus catalytically attenuated EZHIP-M406K demonstrated H3K27ac enrichment at hexokinase-2 and pyruvate dehydrogenase, accompanied by enhanced glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolism. AMPKα-2, a key component of the metabolic regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), also showed H3K27ac enrichment in PFAs and EZHIP-WT NSCs. The AMPK activator metformin lowered EZHIP protein concentrations, increased H3K27me3, suppressed TCA cycle metabolism, and showed therapeutic efficacy in vitro and in vivo in patient-derived PFA xenografts in mice. Our data indicate that PFAs and EZHIP-WT–expressing NSCs are characterized by enhanced glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolism. Repurposing the antidiabetic drug metformin lowered pathogenic EZHIP, increased H3K27me3, and suppressed tumor growth, suggesting that targeting integrated metabolic/epigenetic pathways is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating childhood ependymomas.

Rain Amplification of Persistent Organic Pollutants,"Casas G., Martinez-Varela A., Vila-Costa M., Jiménez B., Dachs J.",2021,Environmental Science and Technology,"Scavenging of gas- and aerosol-phase organic pollutants by rain is an efficient wet deposition mechanism of organic pollutants. However, whereas snow has been identified as a key amplification mechanism of fugacities in cold environments, rain has received less attention in terms of amplification of organic pollutants. In this work, we provide new measurements of concentrations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), organophosphate esters (OPEs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in rain from Antarctica, showing high scavenging ratios. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of previously published concentrations in air and rain was performed, with 46 works covering different climatic regions and a wide range of chemical classes, including PFAS, OPEs, PAHs, polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine compounds, polybromodiphenyl ethers, and dioxins. The rain-aerosol (KRP) and rain-gas (KRG) partition constants averaged 105.5and 104.1, respectively, but showed large variability. The high field-derived values ofKRGare consistent with adsorption onto the raindrops as a scavenging mechanism, in addition to gas-water absorption. The amplification of fugacities by rain deposition was up to 3 orders of magnitude for all chemical classes and was comparable to that due to snow.

Per and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) as a contaminant of emerging concern in surface water: A transboundary review of their occurrences and toxicity effects,"Podder A., Sadmani A.H.M.A., Reinhart D., Chang N.-B., Goel R.",2021,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"Per and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been recognized as contaminants of emerging concerns by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) due to their environmental impact. Several advisory guidelines were proposed worldwide aimed at limiting their occurrences in the aquatic environments, especially for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). This review paper aims to provide a holistic review in the emerging area of PFAS research by summarizing the spatiotemporal variations in PFAS concentrations in surface water systems globally, highlighting the possible trends of occurrences of PFAS, and presenting potential human health impacts as a result of PFAS exposure through surface water matrices. From the data analysis in this study, occurrences of PFOA and PFOS in many surface water matrices were observed to be several folds higher than the US EPA health advisory level of 70 ng/L for lifetime exposure from drinking water. Direct discharge and atmospheric deposition were identified as primary sources of PFAS in surface water and cryosphere, respectively. While global efforts focused on limiting usages of long-chain PFAS such as PFOS and PFOA, the practices of using short-chain PFAS such as perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and PFAS alternatives increased substantially. These compounds are also potentially associated with adverse impacts on human health, animals and biota. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental health, health geography; Environmental impact assessment; Global trends; PFAS; Stormwater; Surface water","Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Environmental Protection Agency; Meteorological problems; Potable water; Surface waters; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Environmental health; Environmental health, health geography; Global trends; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Poly-fluoroalkyl substance; Stormwaters; United States environmental protection agency; Water matrices; Health; alkanesulfonic acid; drinking water; fluorocarbon; sulfonic acid derivative; analysis; animal; government; human; toxicity; United States; water pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Drinking Water; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Sulfonic Acids; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier B.V.
Representation of Minority Groups in Key Pelvic Floor Disorder Trials,"Mckay E.R., Davila J.L., Lee J.A., Rolston R., Agalliu I., Abraham N.E.",2021,Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,"BACKGROUND: Multicenter randomized clinical trials on pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) support evidence-based care. However, many of these studies include homogenous study populations lacking diversity. Heterogeneous sampling allows for greater generalizability while increasing knowledge regarding specific subgroups. The racial/ethnic makeup of key pelvic floor disorder (PFD) trials has not been examined. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate racial/ethnic representation in major PFD clinical trials in comparison to racial/ethnic distribution of PFD in the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES). METHODS: Demographic data were extracted from completed PFD Network (PFDN) and Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network studies, which have resulted in nearly 200 publications. Prevalence of PFD by race/ethnicity was obtained from the NHANES. A representative index (Observed ""n"" by PFD study/Expected ""n"" based on the NHANES-reported prevalence) was calculated as a measure of representation. Meta-analyses were performed for each outcome and overall with respect to race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Eighteen PFDN/Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network studies were analyzed. White women comprised 70%-89% of PFD literature; Black women, 6%-16%; Hispanic women, 9%-15%; Asians, 0.5%-6%; and American Indians, 0%-2%. Representation of White women was higher in 13 of 18 PFDN studies compared with the NHANES prevalence data. Representation of Black women was either decreased or not reported in 10 of 18 index studies compared with the NHANES prevalence data. Hispanic women were absent or underrepresented in 7 of 18 PFDN studies compared with the prevalence data. CONCLUSIONS: Our examination of PFDN and other landmark trials demonstrates inconsistent reporting of minority subgroups, limiting applicability with respect to minority populations. Our study suggests that PFD research would benefit from targeted sampling of minority groups. Copyright © 2021 American Urogynecologic Society.

Inducible liver cancer models in transgenic zebrafish to investigate cancer biology,"Lee A.Q., Li Y., Gong Z.",2021,Cancers,"Primary liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers, which incidence continues to increase while treatment response remains poor; thus, in-depth understanding of tu-mour events is necessary to develop more effective therapies. Animal models for liver cancer are powerful tools to reach this goal. Over the past decade, our laboratory has established multiple oncogene transgenic zebrafish lines that can be robustly induced to develop liver cancer. Histolog-ical, transcriptomic and molecular analyses validate the use of these transgenic zebrafish as experimental models for liver cancer. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of our findings with these inducible zebrafish liver cancer models in tumour initiation, oncogene addiction, tumour microenvironment, gender disparity, cancer cachexia, drug screening and others. Induced oncogene expression causes a rapid change of the tumour microenvironment such as inflammatory responses, increased vascularisation and rapid hepatic growth. In several models, histologically-proven carcinoma can be induced within one week of chemical inducer administration. Interest-ingly, the induced liver tumours show the ability to regress when the transgenic oncogene is sup-pressed by the withdrawal of the chemical inducer. Like human liver cancer, there is a strong bias of liver cancer severity in male zebrafish. After long-term tumour progression, liver cancer-bearing zebrafish also show symptoms of cancer cachexia such as muscle-wasting. In addition, the zebrafish models have been used to screen for anti-metastasis drugs as well as to evaluate environmental toxicants in carcinogenesis. These findings demonstrated that these inducible zebrafish liver cancer models provide rapid and convenient experimental tools for further investigation of fundamental cancer biology, with the potential for the discovery of new therapeutic approaches. © 2021 by the authors.

Trends in the regulation of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS): A scoping review,"Brennan N.M., Evans A.T., Fritz M.K., Peak S.A., von Holst H.E.",2021,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Products containing per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been used for decades in industrial and consumer products. These compounds are persistent in the environment, bi-oaccumulative, and some are toxic to humans and other animals. Since the early 2000s, laws, poli-cies, and regulations have been implemented to reduce the prevalence of PFAS in the environment and exposures to PFAS. We conducted a scoping literature review to identify how PFAS are regulated internationally, at the U.S. national level, and at the U.S. state level, as well as drivers of and challenges to implementing PFAS regulations in the U.S. This review captured peer-reviewed scientific literature (e.g., PubMed), grey literature databases (e.g., SciTech Premium Collection), Google searches, and targeted websites (e.g., state health department websites). We identified 454 relevant documents, of which 61 discussed the non-U.S. PFAS policy, 214 discussed the U.S. national-level PFAS policy, and 181 discussed the U.S. state-level PFAS policy. The drivers of and challenges to PFAS regulation were identified through qualitative analysis. The drivers of PFAS policy identified were political support for regulation, social awareness of PFAS, economic resource availability, and compelling scientific evidence. The challenges to implementing PFAS regulations were political limitations, economic challenges, unclear scientific evidence, and practical challenges. The implications for PFAS policy makers and other stakeholders are discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

The implications of membranes used as separators in microbial fuel cells,"Ramirez-Nava J., Martínez-Castrejón M., García-Mesino R.L., López-Díaz J.A., Talavera-Mendoza O., Sarmiento-Villagrana A., Rojano F., Hernández-Flores G.",2021,Membranes,"Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are electrochemical devices focused on bioenergy generation and organic matter removal carried out by microorganisms under anoxic environments. In these types of systems, the anodic oxidation reaction is catalyzed by anaerobic microorganisms, while the cathodic reduction reaction can be carried out biotically or abiotically. Membranes as separators in MFCs are the primary requirements for optimal electrochemical and microbiological performance. MFC configuration and operation are similar to those of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs)—both having at least one anode and one cathode split by a membrane or separator. The Nafion® 117 (NF-117) membrane, made from perfluorosulfonic acid, is a membrane used as a separator in PEMFCs. By analogy of the operation between electrochemical systems and MFCs, NF-117 membranes have been widely used as separators in MFCs. The main disadvantage of this type of membrane is its high cost; membranes in MFCs can represent up to 60% of the MFC’s total cost. This is one of the challenges in scaling up MFCs: finding alternative membranes or separators with low cost and good electrochemical characteristics. The aim of this work is to critically review state-of-the-art membranes and separators used in MFCs. The scope of this review includes: (i) membrane functions in MFCs, (ii) most-used membranes, (iii) membrane cost and efficiency, and (iv) membrane-less MFCs. Currently, there are at least 20 different membranes or separators proposed and evaluated for MFCs, from basic salt bridges to advanced synthetic polymer-based membranes, including ceramic and unconventional separator materials. Studies focusing on either low cost or the use of natural polymers for proton-exchange membranes (PEM) are still scarce. Alternatively, in some works, MFCs have been operated without membranes; however, significant decrements in Coulombic efficiency were found. As the type of membrane affects the performance and total cost of MFCs, it is recommended that research efforts are increased in order to develop new, more economic membranes that exhibit favorable properties and allow for satisfactory cell performance at the same time. The current state of the art of membranes for MFCs addressed in this review will undoubtedly serve as a key insight for future research related to this topic. © 2021 by the authors.

Associations between human internal chemical exposure to Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) outcomes: Systematic review and evidence map of human epidemiological evidence,"Lefebvre T., Fréour T., Ploteau S., Le Bizec B., Antignac J.-P., Cano-Sancho G.",2021,Reproductive Toxicology,"The impact of environmental chemicals like persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on reproductive health is still poorly understood, despite the high societal and economical costs. The aim of the present study was to systematically review and evaluate the human evidence on the associations between internal levels of POPs and in vitro Fertilization (IVF) outcomes among women. We applied a protocol based on the National Toxicology Program Office of Health Assessment and Translation's guidelines for the study search, selection and quality assessment. Fifteen studies were finally retained in the present work. The results showed that main families of POPs are still pervasive in follicular fluid and serum of women undergoing IVF treatments. Globally, we found inconsistent findings across studies for specific exposure-outcome dyads, suggesting that adverse effects of POPs on IVF outcomes cannot be ruled out. Specifically, there is evidence that POPs, notably some polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides, may impair embryo quality and pregnancy rates. Most studies have been performed in small cohorts (n<50) and focused on PCBs and OCPs, whereas major research gaps remain for emerging compounds (e.g. perfluoroalkylated substances) and the most clinically relevant outcome, live birth rate. The overall evidence presented ‘serious’ or ‘very serious’ risk of bias, mainly due to the lack of consideration of relevant confounding variables, low sample size or underreporting of methods. Globally, we judged the level of evidence being “low”. Given the high economical and societal costs associated to infertility and IVF, further well-designed research is urged to fill the highlighted gaps. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Biomarkers; Follicular fluid; In vitro fertilization; Infertility; Persistent organic pollutants; Systematic review,biological marker; organochlorine pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; adult; Article; birth rate; clinical outcome; embryotoxicity; environmental exposure; female; female infertility; human; in vitro fertilization; live birth; major clinical study; ovary follicle fluid; persistent organic pollutant; pregnancy rate; reproductive toxicity; systematic review,Elsevier Inc.
Fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones: An efficient reagent for the synthesis of fluoroalkylated compounds,"Sivaguru P., Bi X.",2021,Science China Chemistry,"Fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones are versatile reagents that can be used to synthesize a wide range of diverse fluoroalkylated organic molecules. Although it has been known since 1975, the chemistry of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones has recently only received great attention from the scientific community. Generally, they are used as either safe and bench-stable diazo precursors in carbene transfer reactions or as 1,3-dipoles in cycloaddition and cyclization reactions. Notably, fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones to replace toxic fluoroalkyl diazo compounds in carbene transfer reactions reduce the risk of rapid accumulation of explosive diazo compounds and improve functional group compatibility and substrate scope. Given the growing importance of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones in chemical synthesis, a comprehensive review of this topic in the literature is essential to demonstrate their synthetic potential. In this review, we critically summarize and comprehensively analyze the publications in various literatures on the chemistry of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones starting from 1990 to date. The classification of the different reactivity profiles of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones and the efficiencies of similar types of reactions or substrates with fluoroalkyl diazo compounds are compared.

Ultrasound as an Advanced Oxidative Process: A Review on Treating Pharmaceutical Compounds,"Reggiane de Carvalho Costa L., Guerra Pacheco Nunes K., Amaral Féris L.",2021,Chemical Engineering and Technology,"Ultrasound treatment, among the various existing water and effluent treatment techniques, is considered an emerging method in recent years due to the degradation of complex organic and inorganic contaminants. It offers substantial advantages, such as cleanliness, safety, and minor or non-existent secondary pollution products, when compared to other advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). A systematic review of the published peer-reviewed literature relating the use of ultrasound as an AOP is provided based on theoretical concepts and factors that influence sonochemical reactions. The synergistic effects of ultrasound with other degradation technologies for the oxidation of medications are investigated and the importance of assessing toxicity and biodegradability for the treatment of water and effluents with emerging pollutants is evaluated. The mechanistic understanding of the sonochemical effects in drugs, classification of intermediates, and the development of new treatment technologies are still the subject of future research, however, the synergy of treatments and cavitation studies must be considered. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH",Advanced oxidative processes; Contaminants; Pharmaceutical compounds; Sonochemistry; Ultrasound,Biodegradability; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Sonochemistry; Ultrasonics; Water pollution; Advanced oxidation process; Emerging pollutants; Inorganic contaminants; Pharmaceutical compounds; Sonochemical reactions; Treatment techniques; Treatment technologies; Ultrasound treatments; Water treatment,John Wiley and Sons Inc
The integration of MS-based metabolomics and multivariate data analysis allows for improved quality assessment of Zingiber officinale Roscoe,"Salem M.A., Zayed A., Alseekh S., Fernie A.R., Giavalisco P.",2021,Phytochemistry,"Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) is consumed for health-promoting effects and as a food condiment. Comprehensive phytochemical analysis, other than gingerols and shogaols, has not yet been deeply investigated. Hence, the current research aimed to establish a non-targeted metabolomics approach for the discrimination between fresh ginger rhizome samples collected from four different producing countries, i.e., China, India, Pakistan, and Peru. In addition, lab-dried samples were analyzed to trace drying-induced metabolites. A comprehensive extraction procedure was carried out resulting in production of polar and non-polar fractions. The polar fraction was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Fourier transform tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-C18-FT-MS/MS) and gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) post derivatization. UPLC-C8-FT-MS/MS was used for analysis of non-polar fraction. Results revealed for identification of a total of 253 metabolites. In addition, multivariate data analysis (MVDA), including principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated clustering of Asian specimens. Several metabolites with a characteristic pattern for the origin revealing the highest contents of bioactive metabolites in the Peruvian product. Moreover, chemical markers identified, including [6]-gingerol and [6]-shogaol discriminating between fresh and dried samples. Furthermore, abundances of some primary metabolites, including amino acids and cinnamic acid, have confirmed the biosynthetic pathway of gingerols and their transformation upon drying to shogaols. The proposed approach can be applied as a potential candidate for quality assessment of ginger and other medicinal plants. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Biosynthesis; Chemometrics; Geographical origin; Ginger; Metabolomics; Quality assessment; Zingiber officinale; Zingiberaceae,"catechol derivative; fatty alcohol; plant extract; data analysis; ginger; high performance liquid chromatography; metabolomics; tandem mass spectrometry; Catechols; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Data Analysis; Fatty Alcohols; Ginger; Metabolomics; Plant Extracts; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Elsevier Ltd
Metabolomic profiles of A-type procyanidin dimer and trimer with gut microbiota in vitro,"Chen W., Zhang L., Zhao L., Yan F., Zhu X., Lu Q., Liu R.",2021,Journal of Functional Foods,"Although intestinal microbiota plays an important role in the metabolism of procyanidins, the microbial metabolic pathway of A-type procyanidins remains elusive. In this study, A-type dimer procyanidin A1 [EC-(2β-O-7,4β-8)-C] and trimer PPD [EC-(4β-6)-EC-(2β-O-7,4β-8)-C] were incubated with rat faecal microbiota in vitro, and their metabolomic profiles were analyzed by UPLC-QTOF/MS. Multivariate statistical analysis identified 24 and 30 discriminant metabolites for A1 and PPD, respectively. The C-ring opened catabolites of procyanidin A1 and PPD and the typical phenolic acid metabolites were identified, including phenylacetic acid, (4′-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid, 3-phenylpropanoic acid, 3-(4′-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 3-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, and 5-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone. Notably, procyanidin A1 and (epi)catechin were identified from the metabolites of PPD; however, no (epi)catechin was found in the metabolites of procyanidin A1, indicating that the faecal microbiota can destroy B-type linkage (C4-C6 interflavan bond) but not A-type linkage (C4-C8 and additional C2-O-C7 interflavan bond) in the metabolism of A-type procyanidins. © 2021 The Authors",A-type procyanidins; Gut microbiota; Metabolism; Metabolomics,,Elsevier Ltd
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances exposure during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Gao X., Ni W., Zhu S., Wu Y., Cui Y., Ma J., Liu Y., Qiao J., Ye Y., Yang P., Liu C., Zeng F.",2021,Environmental Research,"Background: Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) during pregnancy has been suggested to be associated with adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes; however, the findings have been inconsistent. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overview of these associations. Methods: The online databases PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched comprehensively for eligible studies from inception to February 2021. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random- or fixed-effects models, and dose-response meta-analyses were also conducted when possible. Findings: A total of 29 studies (32,905 participants) were included. The pooled results demonstrated that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure during pregnancy was linearly associated with increased preterm birth risk (pooled OR per 1-ng/ml increase: 1.01, 95% CIs: 1.00–1.02, P = 0.009) and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) exposure showed inverted U-shaped associations with preterm birth risk (P values for the nonlinear trend: 0.025 and 0.030). Positive associations were also observed for exposure to perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) and miscarriage (pooled OR per 1-ng/ml increase: 1.87, 95% CIs: 1.15–3.03) and PFOS and preeclampsia (pooled OR per 1-log increase: 1.27, 95% CIs: 1.06–1.51), whereas exposure to perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA) was inversely associated with preeclampsia risk (pooled OR per 1-log increase: 0.81, 95% CIs: 0.71–0.93). Based on individual evidence, detrimental effects were observed between PFDA exposure and small for gestational age and between PFOA and PFOS and intrauterine growth restriction. No significant associations were found between pregnancy PFAS exposure and other adverse pregnancy outcomes (i.e., gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced hypertension, low birth weight, and large and small for gestational age). Interpretation: Our findings indicated that PFOS, PFOA and PFNA exposure during pregnancy might be associated with increased preterm birth risk and that PFAS exposure might be associated with the risk of miscarriage and preeclampsia. Due to the limited evidence obtained for most associations, additional studies are required to confirm these findings. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Adverse birth outcome; Adverse pregnancy outcome; PFAS; Pregnancy,"n methyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide acetate; organofluorine derivative; perfluoroalkanoic acid; perfluorobutane sulfonate; perfluorobutanoate; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctane sulfonamide; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoropentanoate; perfluorotetradecanoate; perfluorotridecanoate; perfluoroundecanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; sulfonamide; sulfonic acid derivative; toxic substance; unclassified drug; chemical substance; concentration (composition); diabetes; health risk; literature review; meta-analysis; pollution exposure; pregnancy; risk factor; adolescent; adult; adverse outcome; case control study; cohort analysis; disease association; Embase; environmental exposure; evidence based practice; female; fetus outcome; high risk pregnancy; human; intrauterine growth retardation; large for gestational age; low birth weight; maternal blood; maternal exposure; maternal hypertension; Medline; mother; newborn disease; nonlinear system; observational study; preeclampsia; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; prenatal exposure; progeny; Review; risk factor; small for date infant; spontaneous abortion; systematic review; trend study; Web of Science; meta analysis; newborn; pregnancy; prematurity; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Premature Birth",Academic Press Inc.
Perfluorobutane contrast-enhanced ultrasonography for the diagnosis of HCC: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Yang Y., Liu C., Yan J., Liu K.",2021,Abdominal Radiology,"Objectives: Perfluorobutane ultrasound contrast agent as a new type of contrast agent has a good performance in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aim to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of Perfluorobutane contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (P-CEUS) in the diagnosis of HCC with a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane, Clinical Key, Wan Fang, CBM and CNKI databases were systematically searched and checked for studies using P-CEUS in HCC, from 2007 to 2020. Data necessary to construct 2 × 2 contingency tables were extracted from included studies. The QUADAS tool was utilized to assess the methodologic quality of the studies. Meta-analysis included data pooling, subgroup analyses, meta-regression and investigation of publication bias was comprehensively performed. Results: Nine studies were included in this meta-analysis and the overall diagnostic accuracy in characterization of HCC was as follows: pooled sensitivity, 0.90 (95% confidence interval: 0.82–0.95); pooled specificity, 0.97 (0.93–0.98); pooled positive likelihood ratio, 27.2 (14.1 to − 52.3); and pooled negative likelihood ratio, 0.10 (0.06–0.18). The area under the comprehensive receiving operation characteristic curve was 0.98 (0.97–0.99). Conclusion: The sensitivity and specificity of P-CEUS are more valuable than other imaging techniques (such as computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging). However, due to the large differences in the data samples collected in this study, statistical heterogeneity results. P-CEUS can significantly improve the diagnostic efficiency of previous contrast-enhanced ultrasound for HCC.

Cathinones in urine samples: A review of recent advances for their determination by chromatographic and related techniques,"Pérez-Alcaraz A., Borrull F., Calull M., Aguilar C.",2021,TrAC - Trends in Analytical Chemistry,"In recent years, the consumption of synthetic cathinones has grown continuously as these drugs represent a more affordable and obtainable alternative to amphetamines. After consumption, cathinones have a stimulant effect and can be found in the human organism in their pure form or metabolized. As these compounds are difficult to monitor by routine drug screening it is very important to develop procedures capable of detecting and monitoring their consumption. Different strategies have been developed for the analysis of cathinones in biological matrices such as blood, hair or oral fluid. However, urine has been most widely used as the procedure is non-invasive and samples can be obtained in larger volumes than other biological matrices. The present review provides a critical discussion of the latest trends for the determination of cathinones in urine samples, focusing particularly on the use of chromatographic techniques, which is the approach most widely reported in the literature. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Capillary electrophoresis; Cathinones; Gas chromatography; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Urine analysis,"Gas chromatography; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Biological matrixes; Cathinone; Chromatographic techniques; Critical discussions; Drug-screening; Human organisms; Large volumes; Oral fluids; Urine analysis; Urine sample; Capillary electrophoresis; 1 (2,3 dihydro 1h inden 5 yl) 2 (pyrrolidine 1 yl)butan 1 one; 2 propanol; 4 methyl n ethyl cathinone; 4' methylmethcathinone; acetic acid ethyl ester; acetone; alpha pyrrolidinobutiophenone; amphetamine; anabolic agent; beta glucuronidase; cannabinoid; cathinone; chloroform; dichloromethane; heptafluoro butyric anhydride; molecularly imprinted polymer; n methyl n (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamid; n,o bis (trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide; narcotic agent; pentafluorobenzoyl chloride; pentafluoropropionic anhydride; perfluoroalkanoic acid; psychotropic agent; recreational drug; trifluoroacetic anhydride; tropane alkaloid; unclassified drug; analytic method; capillary electrophoresis; cation exchange; chromatography; degradation; dilution; drug urine level; electrokinetic supercharging; field amplified sample injection; gas chromatography; human; hydrolysis; liquid chromatography; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liquid liquid extraction; liquid phase microextraction; mass spectrometry; precipitation; preservation and storage; rapidfire mass spectroscopy; Review; solid phase extraction; solid phase microextraction; strong cation exchange; supercritical fluid chromatography; urinalysis; urine dilution; urine sampling; volumetric absorptive microsampling",Elsevier B.V.
Biocompatibility of intraocular liquid tamponade agents: an update,"Romano M.R., Ferrara M., Nepita I., D’Amato Tothova J., Giacometti Schieroni A., Reami D., Mendichi R., Liggieri L., Repetto R.",2021,Eye (Basingstoke),"Intraocular liquids tamponade agents, such as perfluorocarbon liquids (PFCLs), semifluorinated alkanes (SFAs), silicone oils (SOs) and heavy silicone oils (HSOs), are a crucial intraoperative and/or postoperative tool in vitreoretinal surgery, in particular for the management of complex vitreoretinal diseases. However, their use is not without complications, which are potentially severe. Consequently, a growing interest has been devoted to the biocompatibility of these compounds and the adequacy of current regulations that should guarantee their safety. Obviously, an updated knowledge on research findings and potential risks associated to the use of intraocular liquid compounds is essential, not only for vitreoretinal surgeons, but also for any ophthalmologist involved in the management of patients receiving intraocular liquid tamponades.

Effect of microplastics on aquatic biota: A hormetic perspective,"Sun T., Zhan J., Li F., Ji C., Wu H.",2021,Environmental Pollution,"As emerging pollutants, microplastics (MPs) have been found globally in various freshwater and marine matrices. This study recompiled 270 endpoints of 3765 individuals from 43 publications, reporting the onset of enhanced biological performance and reduced oxidative stress biomarkers induced by MPs in aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations (≤1 mg/L, median = 0.1 mg/L). The stimulatory responses of consumption, growth, reproduction and survival ranged from 131% to 144% of the control, with a combined response of 136%. The overall inhibitory response of 9 oxidative stress biomarkers was 71% of the control, and commonly below 75%. The random-effects meta-regression indicated that the extents of MPs-induced responses were independent of habitat, MP composition, morphology, particle size and exposure duration. The results implied that the exposure to MPs at low and high concentrations might induce opposite/non-monotonic responses in aquatic biota. Correspondingly, the hormetic dose response relationships were found at various endpoints, such as reproduction, genotoxicity, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity and behavioral alteration. Hormesis offers a novel perspective for understanding the dose response mode of aquatic organisms exposed to low and high concentrations of MPs, highlighting the necessity to incorporate the hormetic dose response model into the ecological/environmental risk assessment of MPs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Aquatic environment; Dose response; Environmentally relevant concentrations; Plastic pollution; Risk assessment,"Aquatic organisms; Biomarkers; Cell proliferation; Marine pollution; Particle size; Random processes; Risk assessment; Aquatic biota; Aquatic environments; Dose response; Emerging pollutants; Environmentally relevant concentration; Fresh Water; Microplastics; Oxidative stress biomarkers; Plastic pollutions; Risks assessments; Microplastic; biological marker; microplastic; plastic; aquatic organism; biological analysis; biomarker; dose-response relationship; ecological impact; immune response; oxidative stress; plastic waste; pollution effect; risk assessment; aquatic flora; Article; behavior disorder; biota; chemical composition; chemical structure; concentration (parameter); environmental exposure; environmental factor; genotoxicity; growth rate; immunotoxicity; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; oxidative stress; particle size; reproduction; risk assessment; species habitat; stimulus response; survival rate; water pollution; analysis; biota; hormesis; human; toxicity; water pollutant; Biota; Hormesis; Humans; Microplastics; Plastics; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier Ltd
"Early-Life Exposure to Per- and Poly-Fluorinated Alkyl Substances and Growth, Adiposity, and Puberty in Children: A Systematic Review","Lee Y.J., Jung H.W., Kim H.Y., Choi Y.-J., Lee Y.A.",2021,Frontiers in Endocrinology,"Per- or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a family of synthetic polyfluorinated compounds, are widely used in consumer products. Ubiquitous exposures to PFAS, in consideration of their persistence, bioaccumulation potential, and toxicities have led to concerns regarding possible harmful effects during critical periods of development in early-life and long-term consequences on health. The potential effects of PFAS depend on various factors including the type of PFAS and the timing and level of exposure. We performed a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature to assess the effects of early-life PFAS exposure on prenatal and postnatal growth, adiposity, and puberty in children and adolescents. For birth size, most studies indicated that prenatal PFAS exposure, in particular long-chain PFAS, may impair fetal growth, albeit some reports of null associations with maternal PFAS. For growth within 2 years of age, prenatal PFAS exposure showed no associations with height and either null or negative associations with weight. However, postnatal PFAS exposures were inversely related to height and weight at 2 years in a cross-sectional study. For postnatal adiposity, prenatal PFAS may mostly have negative associations with body mass index in the first 2 years of life, but positive relationships with adiposity in childhood and adolescence, although some studies showed null associations. For puberty, the evidence for associations between early-life PFAS exposure and pubertal development or sex hormone levels were limited and inconclusive. From experimental studies, plausible mechanisms through which PFAS may affect early-life growth and puberty include PFAS-induced activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, alterations of thyroid or steroid hormone synthesis and metabolism, and their weak estrogenic or anti-androgenic properties. Although the published literature suggests possible effects of PFAS exposures on early-life growth, adiposity, and puberty, current human evidence is limited in establishing PFAS-induced effects on early-life physical development. Further investigation is warranted to clarify PFAS-induced effects on growth and physical development in consideration of the critical time-window of exposure, concomitant exposure to chemical mixtures including various PFAS types, and possible non-monotonic dose-response relationship for growth and adiposity trajectories. © Copyright © 2021 Lee, Jung, Kim, Choi and Lee.",adiposity; adolescent; birth weight; child; growth; perfluorinated alkylated substances; puberty,alkyl group; estradiol; follitropin; luteinizing hormone; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; polyfluoroalkyl substance; steroid hormone; testosterone; thyroid hormone; unclassified drug; bioaccumulation; birth length; birth weight; body fat; body height; body mass; body weight; childhood obesity; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; environmental exposure; fetus growth; fluorination; gestational age; hormone metabolism; hormone synthesis; human; long term exposure; menarche; meta analysis; physical parameters; ponderal index; postnatal growth; precocious puberty; prenatal exposure; Review; risk assessment; skinfold thickness; systematic review; waist circumference; waist to height ratio,Frontiers Media S.A.
"Perfluoroalkyl acids on suspended particles: Significant transport pathways in surface runoff, surface waters, and subsurface soils","Borthakur A., Wang M., He M., Ascencio K., Blotevogel J., Adamson D.T., Mahendra S., Mohanty S.K.",2021,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"Eroded particles from the source zone could transport a high concentration of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) to sediments and water bodies. Yet, the contribution of suspended particles has not been systematically reviewed. Analyzing reported studies, we quantitatively demonstrate that suspended particles in surface water can contain significantly higher concentrations of PFAAs than the sediment below, indicating the source of suspended particles are not the sediment but particles eroded and carried from the source zone upstream. The affinity of PFAAs to particles depends on the particle composition, including organic carbon fraction and iron or aluminum oxide content. In soils, most PFAAs are retained within the top 5 m below the ground surface. The distribution of PFAAs in the subsurface varies based on site properties and local weather conditions. The depth corresponding to the maximum concentration of PFAA in soil decreases with an increase in soil organic carbon or rainfall amount received in the catchment areas. We attribute a greater accumulation of PFAAs near the upper layer of the subsurface to an increase in the accumulation of particles eroded from source zones upstream receiving heavy rainfall. Precursor transformation in the aerobic zone is significantly higher than in the anaerobic zone, thereby making the aerobic subsurface zone serve as a long-term source of groundwater pollution. Collectively, these results suggest that suspended particles, often an overlooked vector for PFAAs, can be a dominant pathway for the transport of PFAAs in environments. © 2021 The Authors",Colloids; PFAS transport; Rainfall intensity; Soil organic carbon; Source zone; Subsurface leaching,"Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Catchments; Colloids; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Iron oxides; Rain; River pollution; Soil pollution; Soils; Surface waters; Suspended sediments; Perfluoroalkyl acids; PFAS transport; Rainfall intensity; Soil organic carbon; Source zone; Subsurface leaching; Subsurface soil; Surface runoffs; Suspended particles; Transport pathways; Organic carbon; ground water; iron oxide; organic carbon; rain; surface water; carbon; fluorocarbon; ground water; aluminum oxide; chemical compound; concentration (composition); pollutant transport; runoff; soil pollution; surface water; suspended particulate matter; catchment area; colloid; controlled study; maximum concentration; mineralogy; particle resuspension; Review; runoff; soil; surface runoff; weathering; environmental monitoring; soil; water pollutant; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Groundwater; Soil; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier B.V.
"Plant feed additives as natural alternatives to the use of synthetic antioxidant vitamins on livestock mammals’ performances, health, and oxidative status: A review of the literature in the last 20 years","Manuelian C.L., Pitino R., Simoni M., Mavrommatis A., De Marchi M., Righi F., Tsiplakou E.",2021,Antioxidants,"In the last two decades, the interest in natural plant feed additives (PFA) as alternatives to synthetic vitamins in livestock nutrition has increased. After a systematic review, a total of 19 peer-reviewed papers published between 2000 and 2020 were retained to evaluate the antioxidant effects of PFA compared to synthetic antioxidant vitamins (mainly vitamin E; VitE) in livestock nutrition. These studies demonstrated that PFAs could be as efficient as VitE in counteracting oxidative stress in pigs, rabbits, and ruminants. However, PFAs only positively affected animals’ growth performance and feed efficiency in some monogastric studies. The PFA can affect antioxidant enzyme activity in a dose-and method of administration-dependent manner. The antioxidant capacity of both PFA and VitE were depressed in cows fed with diets rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Variability among studies could be related to species differences. Despite the interest of the feed industry sector in PFA, there are still very few studies evaluating their antioxidant effect in species other than poultry. © 2021 by the authors.

Perfluorooctane Sulfonate in US Ambient Surface Waters: A Review of Occurrence in Aquatic Environments and Comparison to Global Concentrations,"Jarvis A.L., Justice J.R., Elias M.C., Schnitker B., Gallagher K.",2021,Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is one of the dominant perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) detected in aquatic ecosystems. It has been used in a wide range of industrial and consumer products for decades. The unique properties of PFOS, including its stability and resistance to degradation, have made it highly persistent in the aquatic environment. Because of its persistence, potential toxicity, and occurrence in aquatic ecosystems, interest in PFOS has increased in recent decades. Despite this interest, current information on the environmental distribution of PFOS in ambient surface waters of the United States is fairly limited. This critical review summarizes the currently available literature on PFOS occurrence in surface waters across the United States and highlights existing data gaps. Available data are largely from a handful of study areas with known PFAS manufacturing or industrial uses, with much of the data collected from freshwater systems in eastern states and the upper Midwest. Measured PFOS concentrations in surface waters vary widely, over 8 orders of magnitude, with the highest concentrations occurring downstream from manufacturing and industrial use plants, areas near aqueous film-forming foam–use sites, and sites where PFOS precursors were used in textile treatment. Non–point source–related occurrences are highest near urbanized areas with high population densities. Current data illustrate the occurrence of PFOS in surface waters across multiple US states. Additional data are needed to better understand PFOS occurrence in US aquatic ecosystems, particularly in estuarine and marine systems and where monitoring data are not available (e.g., southwestern, central, and western United States). Additional PFOS occurrence data would provide valuable information on potential spatial and temporal variability in surface waters and possible risks posed to aquatic ecosystems.

Research Progress on On-Chip Fourier Transform Spectrometer,"Zhang L., Chen J., Ma C., Li W., Qi Z., Xue N.",2021,Laser and Photonics Reviews,"A Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) is recognized as a highly precise analytical instrument for analyzing the constituent elements of matter in the fields of physics, chemistry, aerospace, and so on. With the emergence and development of miniaturized and portable devices in numerous scientific and technological fields, there has been an urgent need for on-chip FTSs due to their benefits of small size, portability, low energy consumption, and robustness. However, the small size of on-chip FTSs hinders the acquisition of a large optical path difference, resulting in a low resolution of the spectrometer. In addition, the sampler spacing is not sufficiently small to satisfy Nyquist's sampling theorem, directly influencing the bandwidth of the spectrometer. Therefore, studies have been performed to investigate the trade-off between the reduced size and performance of spectrometers. This paper aims to systematically review the progress in on-chip FTSs, especially in on-chip static FTSs, including spatially modulated, temporally modulated, and space-time comodulated FTSs, from the aspects of theories, implementations, and performance indicators. Finally, the paper ends with a discussion of the challenges and a view of the prospective development of this exciting field. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH",fourier transform; on-chip; spectrometer,Bolometers; Chemical analysis; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Spectrometers; Analytical instrument; Constituent elements; Fourier transform spectrometers; Low energy consumption; Optical path difference; Performance indicators; Sampling theorems; Spatially modulated; Spacecraft instruments,John Wiley and Sons Inc
Within and between breeding-season changes in contaminant occurrence and body condition in the Antarctic breeding south polar skua,"Midthaug H.K., Hitchcock D.J., Bustnes J.O., Polder A., Descamps S., Tarroux A., Soininen E.M., Borgå K.",2021,Environmental Pollution,"The Antarctic ecosystem represents a remote region far from point sources of pollution. Still, Antarctic marine predators, such as seabirds, are exposed to organohalogen contaminants (OHCs) which may induce adverse health effects. With increasing restrictions and regulations on OHCs, the levels and exposure are expected to decrease over time. We studied south polar skua (Catharacta maccormiciki), a top predator seabird, to compare OHC concentrations measured in whole blood from 2001/2002 and 2013/2014 in Dronning Maud Land. As a previous study found increasing organochlorine concentrations with sampling day during the 2001/2002 breeding season, suggesting dietary changes, we investigated if this increase was repeated in the 2013/2014 breeding season. In addition to organochlorines, we analyzed hydroxy-metabolites, brominated contaminants and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in 2013/2014, as well as dietary descriptors of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, to assess potential changes in diet during breeding. Lipid normalized concentrations of individual OHCs were 63%, 87% and 105% higher for hexachlorobenzene (HCB), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE), and ∑Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), respectively, in 2013/2014 compared to 2001/2002. South polar skuas males in 2013/2014 were in poorer body condition than in 2001/2002, and with higher pollutant levels. Poorer body condition may cause the remobilization of contaminants from stored body reserves, and continued exposure to legacy contaminants at overwintering areas may explain the unexpected higher OHC concentrations in 2013/2014 than 2001/2002. Concentrations of protein-associated PFAS increased with sampling day during the 2013/2014 breeding season, whereas the lipid-soluble chlorinated pesticides, PCBs and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs) showed no change. OHC occurrence was not correlated with stable isotopes. The PFAS biomagnification through the local food web at the colony should be investigated further. © 2021 The Author(s)",Catharacta maccormicki; HCB; Mirex; Organic pollutants; PCB; PFAS; Seabirds,"Contamination; Ecosystems; Ethylene; Isotopes; Marine pollution; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Body condition; Breeding season; Catharactum maccormicki; Contaminant concentrations; Hexachlorobenzene; Organics; Organochlorines; Organohalogen contaminants; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Seabird; Organic pollutants; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; bromine; carbon; hexachlorobenzene; nitrogen; organochlorine derivative; organohalogen derivative; per and polyfluoroalkyl substance; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; stable isotope; unclassified drug; chlorinated hydrocarbon; polychlorinated biphenyl; body condition; breeding season; chemical pollutant; marine pollution; organic pollutant; organochlorine; pollution effect; seabird; Antarctica; Article; blood sampling; body constitution; breeding; Catharacta maccormiciki; chemical analysis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; diet; female; male; metabolite; nonhuman; organic pollution; organism colony; sampling; seabird; season; animal; Charadriiformes; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; pollutant; season; Antarctica; Catharacta; Catharacta maccormicki; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Charadriiformes; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Male; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Seasons",Elsevier Ltd
Association between maternal exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Deji Z., Liu P., Wang X., Zhang X., Luo Y., Huang Z.",2021,Science of the Total Environment,"Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), a class of persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals, are widely used in consumer products due to their unique amphiphilic properties. Previous epidemiological studies suggest association of maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes, while evidences about the association are inconsistent. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the relationship of maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Twenty-one relevant studies were identified from three databases before 2020. The quality, heterogeneity and possibility of publication bias of included studies were evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, Q-statistic and Begg's test, respectively. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained by means of random-effects meta-analysis models. Meta-analysis results revealed that maternal exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) may have a positive association with preterm birth (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.38). The pooled estimates also showed limited evidence of association between maternal perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure and miscarriage (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 0.92, 2.38) with obvious heterogeneity (I2 = 93.9, p &lt; 0.01). However, no such significant associations were found between the other PFASs and miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth. In addition, the subgroup analyses showed that studies on the relationship of maternal PFASs exposure and miscarriage were mainly contributed by developed countries. The meta-analysis results indicated maternal exposure to PFOS can increase the risk of preterm birth. The results of the included studies are inconsistent and the effects of PFASs on human health are complex. Further studies with enough samples are required to verify these findings. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Meta-analysis; Miscarriage; Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances; Preterm birth; Stillbirth,"Consumer products; Endocrine disrupters; Health risks; Quality control; Random processes; Risk assessment; Confidence interval; Maternal exposure; Meta-analysis; Miscarriage; Odd ratios; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Preterm birth; Stillbirth; Systematic Review; Obstetrics; epidemiology; health risk; meta-analysis; pollution exposure; pregnancy; endocrine disruptor; fluorocarbon; adverse event; female; human; maternal exposure; meta analysis; newborn; pollutant; pregnancy; prematurity; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Exposure; Pregnancy; Premature Birth",Elsevier B.V.
Polyaniline-based adsorbents for aqueous pollutants removal: A review,"Samadi A., Xie M., Li J., Shon H., Zheng C., Zhao S.",2021,Chemical Engineering Journal,"Water contamination by a variety of pollutants, such as conventional pollutants (e.g. heavy metals and organics) and emerging micropollutants (e.g. personal care products and endocrine disrupting compounds) is of great concern. Various technologies have been developed to address this critical challenge. Among them, adsorption by polyaniline (PANI)-based nanocomposites, has gained growing research interest recently due to their unique electrical characteristics and many other benefits, such as facile synthesis, low cost, excellent environmental stability, simple acid-base doping/dedoping process, reactive NH– groups, and tunable properties. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the typical PANI-based adsorbents and their properties. Moreover, the removal of various aqueous contaminants (including heavy metals and metalloids, organic dyes and emerging pollutants) by PANI-based adsorbents is discussed and assessed. The unique doping/dedoping of PANI-based adsorbents alters the morphology, pore size, surface charge and functional groups of the adsorbents, leading to enhanced adsorbent-adsorbate interactions and thus adsorption performance. The adsorption mechanisms of aqueous pollutants by PANI-based adsorbents include electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, π–π interactions, hydrogen bonding, chelating and/or complexation effects. Finally, the future outlooks on aqueous pollutants removal by PANI-based adsorbents are presented. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Emerging pollutants; Heavy metal removal; Organic dyes; Polyaniline; Water treatment,Adsorption; Endocrine disrupters; Hydrogen bonds; Polyaniline; Pore size; Stripping (dyes); Van der Waals forces; Water pollution; Water treatment; Doping/dedoping; Emerging pollutants; Endocrine disrupting compound; Heavy metal removal; Micropollutants; Organic dye; Organics; Personal care products; Pollutants removal; Water contamination; Heavy metals,Elsevier B.V.
Early-life exposure to widespread environmental toxicants and children's health risks: A focus on the post-vaccination antibody potency or immunoglobulin levels,"Zeng Z., Ngai S., Wang Q., Liang W., Huo X.",2021,Science of the Total Environment,"Early-life exposure to widespread environmental toxicants including organic pollutants (OPs), heavy metals, and air pollutants is detrimental to human health. The immunotoxicity of these environmental toxicants are well acknowledged and a few studies have focused on the relationship between environmental toxicant exposure and vaccine antibody potency or immunoglobulin (Ig) levels in children. Altered antibody titers or Ig levels in post-vaccination children were correlated with these environmental exposures; however, the effects of environmental toxicants on post-vaccination antibody potency or Ig levels in children have not been summarized. The objectives of this systematic review are therefore 1) to summarize the current studies concerning the associations of early-life exposure to environmental toxicants with vaccine antibody potency or Ig levels in children; and 2) to analyze the possible mechanisms underlying exposure-related alterations of antibody titers or Ig levels against different vaccines. We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database for relevant literature with the key terms and included articles up to September 30, 2020. Based on the eligibility criteria, 28 articles were selected. These studies investigated the associations of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (5 studies), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) (6 studies), other OPs (4 studies), heavy metals (11 studies) and air pollutants, e.g. PM2.5, (3 studies) with the serum-specific antibody concentrations or Ig levels against different vaccines, such as anti-Hib, tetanus, diphtheria toxoid, IgA, IgE, etc. These studies suggest that exposure to these toxicants is generally associated with decreased potency of antibodies produced from childhood immunizations and overall deficiency in vaccines' provided protection. This systematic review provides evidence that exposure-induced changes to humoral immune-related tissue/cells/molecules response to vaccines may play predominant roles in the inverse associations between antibody responsiveness to vaccines and environmental toxicants. This review could thus also help us to conduct better immunization policies for children under environmental toxicant burdens. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Antibody titer; Children; Early-life exposure; Environmental toxicants; Immunoglobulin levels,Health risks; Heavy metals; Immunization; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Vaccines; Air pollutants; Antibody titers; Child; Children's health; Earliest life; Early-life exposure; Environmental toxicants; Immunoglobulin level; Organics; Systematic Review; Antibodies; diphtheria toxoid; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin E; perfluoro compound; polychlorinated biphenyl; antibody; child health; concentration (composition); immunization; pollution exposure; toxic material; vaccination; antibody titer; child; environmental exposure; exposure; health hazard; human; humoral immunity; immunoglobulin blood level; immunotoxicity; particulate matter 2.5; pollutant; priority journal; Review; vaccination,Elsevier B.V.
A Comprehensive Non-targeted Analysis Study of the Prenatal Exposome,"Panagopoulos Abrahamsson D., Wang A., Jiang T., Wang M., Siddharth A., Morello-Frosch R., Park J.-S., Sirota M., Woodruff T.J.",2021,Environmental Science and Technology,"Recent technological advances in mass spectrometry have enabled us to screen biological samples for a very broad spectrum of chemical compounds allowing us to more comprehensively characterize the human exposome in critical periods of development. The goal of this study was three-fold: (1) to analyze 590 matched maternal and cord blood samples (total 295 pairs) using non-targeted analysis (NTA); (2) to examine the differences in chemical abundance between maternal and cord blood samples; and (3) to examine the associations between exogenous chemicals and endogenous metabolites. We analyzed all samples with high-resolution mass spectrometry using liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS) in both positive and negative electrospray ionization modes (ESI+ and ESI-) and in soft ionization (MS) and fragmentation (MS/MS) modes for prioritized features. We confirmed 19 unique compounds with analytical standards, we tentatively identified 73 compounds with MS/MS spectra matching, and we annotated 98 compounds using an annotation algorithm. We observed 103 significant associations in maternal and 128 in cord samples between compounds annotated as endogenous and compounds annotated as exogenous. An example of these relationships was an association between three poly and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and endogenous fatty acids in both the maternal and cord samples indicating potential interactions between PFASs and fatty acid regulating proteins. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",blood samples; exposome; high-resolution mass spectrometry; molecular interaction networks; non-targeted analysis; per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances; pregnancy,"Association reactions; Blood; Electrospray ionization; Indicators (chemical); Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; Biological samples; Chemical abundance; Endogenous metabolites; High resolution mass spectrometry; Liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometries; Negative electrospray ionizations; Poly and perfluoroalkyl substance (PFASs); Technological advances; Fatty acids; fatty acid; advanced technology; fatty acid; mass spectrometry; pollution exposure; protein; adult; Article; blood sampling; chemical analysis; controlled study; electrospray; exposome; female; human; human experiment; liquid chromatography; maternal blood; molecular interaction; prenatal period; quality control; tandem mass spectrometry; time of flight mass spectrometry; umbilical cord blood; electrospray mass spectrometry; pregnancy; tandem mass spectrometry; Chromatography, Liquid; Exposome; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",American Chemical Society
Advanced oxidation processes coupled with nanomaterials for water treatment,"Cardoso I.M.F., Cardoso R.M.F., Esteves da Silva J.C.G.",2021,Nanomaterials,"Water quality management will be a priority issue in the near future. Indeed, due to scarcity and/or contamination of the water, regulatory frameworks will be increasingly strict to reduce environmental impacts of wastewater and to allow water to be reused. Moreover, drinking water quality standards must be improved in order to account for the emerging pollutants that are being detected in tap water. These tasks can only be achieved if new improved and sustainable water treatment technologies are developed. Nanomaterials are improving the ongoing research on advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). This work reviews the most important AOPs, namely: persulfate, chlorine and NH2Cl based processes, UV/H2O2, Fenton processes, ozone, and heterogeneous photocatalytic processes. A critical review of the current coupling of nanomaterials to some of these AOPs is presented. Besides the active role of the nanomaterials in the degradation of water contaminants/pollutants in the AOPs, the relevance of their adsorbent/absorbent function in these processes is also discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

Understanding the impact of perfluorinated compounds on cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors: A meta‐analysis study,"Abdullah Soheimi S.S., Abdul Rahman A., Abdul Latip N., Ibrahim E., Sheikh Abdul Kadir S.H.",2021,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are non‐biodegradable synthetic chemical compounds that are widely used in manufacturing many household products. Many studies have reported the association between PFCs exposure with the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, those reports are still debatable, due to their findings. Thus, this review paper aimed to analyse the association of PFCs compound with CVDs and their risk factors in humans by systematic review and meta‐analysis. Google Scholar, PubMed and ScienceDirect were searched for PFCs studies on CVDs and their risk from 2009 until present. The association of PFCs exposure with the prevalence of CVDs and their risk factors were assessed by calculating the quality criteria, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). CVDs risk factors were divided into serum lipid profile (main risk factor) and other known risk factors. The meta‐analysis was then used to derive a combined OR test for heterogeneity in findings between studies. Twenty‐nine articles were included. Our meta‐analysis indicated that PFCs exposure could be associated with CVDs (Test for overall effect: z= 2.2, p = 0.02; Test for heterogeneity: I2 = 91.6%, CI = 0.92–1.58, p &lt; 0.0001) and their risk factors (Test for overall effect: z= 4.03, p &lt; 0.0001; Test for heterogeneity: I2 = 85.8%, CI = 1.00– 1.14, p &lt; 0.0001). In serum lipids, total cholesterol levels are frequently reported associated with the exposure of PFCs. Among PFCs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) exposure increased the risk of CVDs than other types of PFCs. Although the risk of PFOA and PFOS were positively associated with CVDs and their risk factors, more observational studies shall be carried out to identify the long‐term effects of these contaminants in premature CVDs development in patients. © 2021 by the authors.

Comparative Assessment of Three Posterior Fossa Decompression Techniques and Evaluation of the Evidence Supporting the Efficacy of Syrinx Shunting and Filum Terminale Sectioning in Chiari Malformation Type I. A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis,"Antkowiak L., Tabakow P.",2021,World Neurosurgery,"Background: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of posterior fossa decompression (PFD), posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty (PFDD), and posterior fossa decompression with resection of tonsils (PFDRT) in Chiari malformation type I (CMI). Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the evidence supporting the efficacy of filum terminale sectioning (FTS), syringosubarachnoid shunting (SSS), and syringoperitoneal shunting (SPS) in CMI. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases were screened for English-language studies published from inception until August 11, 2020. A total of 3593 studies were identified through the searching process. Fifteen cohort studies were included in the systematic review and network meta-analysis. Results: No studies concerning FTS, SSS, and SPS were found eligible. Therefore, only PFD, PFDD, and PFDRT were compared. PFDD showed significantly higher incidence of complications (relative risk [RR], 3.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.54–5.64) cerebrospinal fluid leak (RR, 9.74; 95% CI, 2.33–40.78) and neurologic deficit (RR, 8.76; 95% CI, 2.08–36.90) than did PFD. Both PFDD and PFDRT achieved higher syringomyelia improvement (RR, 1.23, 95% CI, 1.09–1.39 and RR, 1.32, 95% CI, 1.15–1.51, respectively) and greater clinical improvement (RR, 1.24, 95% CI, 1.10–1.39 and RR, 1.24, 95% CI, 1.08–1.44, respectively) than did PFD. No differences were found between PFDD and PFDRT. Conclusions: PFDD and PFDRT are superior to PFD, especially in patients with syringomyelia-Chiari complex, because of greater syringomyelia reduction and better clinical improvement. However, PFDD and PFDRT can be considered equally efficient. There is no evidence pleading in favor of SFT, SSS, and SPS over any PFD technique. © 2021 The Author(s)",Chiari malformation type I; Duraplasty; Filum terminale sectioning; Posterior fossa decompression; Syringoperitoneal shunting; Syringosubarachnoid shunting; Tonsillectomy,"Arnold Chiari malformation; cauda equina; cerebrospinal fluid shunting; comparative study; decompression surgery; human; meta analysis; neurosurgery; procedures; Arnold-Chiari Malformation; Cauda Equina; Cerebrospinal Fluid Shunts; Decompression, Surgical; Humans; Neurosurgical Procedures",Elsevier Inc.
Current Situation and Challenges in Vitreous Substitutes,"Mondelo-García C., Bandín-Vilar E., García-Quintanilla L., Castro-Balado A., del Amo E.M., Gil-Martínez M., Blanco-Teijeiro M.J., González-Barcia M., Zarra-Ferro I., Fernández-Ferreiro A., Otero-Espinar F.J.",2021,Macromolecular Bioscience,"Vitreo-retinal disorders constitute a significant portion of treatable ocular diseases. These pathologies often require vitreo-retinal surgery and, as a consequence, the use of vitreous substitutes. Nowadays, the vitreous substitutes that are used in clinical practice are mainly divided into gases (air, SF6, C2F6, C3F8) and liquids (perfluorocarbon liquids, silicone oils, and heavy silicone oils). There are specific advantages and drawbacks to each of these, which determine their clinical indications. However, developing the ideal biomaterial for vitreous substitution continues to be one of the most important challenges in ophthalmology, and a multidisciplinary approach is required. In this sense, recent research has focused on the development of biocompatible, biodegradable, and injectable hydrogels (natural, synthetic, and smart), which also act as medium and long-term internal tamponade agents. This comprehensive review aims to cover the main characteristics and indications for use of the extensive range of vitreous substitutes that are currently used in clinical practice, before going on to describe the hydrogels that have been developed recently and which have emerged as promising biomaterials for vitreous substitution. © 2021 The Authors.

Association between urinary per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances and COVID-19 susceptibility,"Ji J., Song L., Wang J., Yang Z., Yan H., Li T., Yu L., Jian L., Jiang F., Li J., Zheng J., Li K.",2021,Environment International,"Background and Objective: The growing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the urgency of identifying individuals most at risk of infection. Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are manufactured fluorinated chemicals widely used in many industrial and household products. The objective of this case-control study was to assess the association between PFASs exposure and COVID-19 susceptibility and to elucidate the metabolic dysregulation associated with PFASs exposure in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Total 160 subjects (80 COVID-19 patients and 80 symptom-free controls) were recruited from Shanxi and Shandong provinces, two regions heavily polluted by PFASs in China. Twelve common PFASs were quantified in both urine and serum. Urine metabolome profiling was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: In unadjusted models, the risk of COVID-19 infection was positively associated with urinary levels of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (Odds ratio: 2.29 [95% CI: 1.52–3.22]), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (2.91, [1.95–4.83], and total PFASs (∑ (12) PFASs) (3.31, [2.05–4.65]). After controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), the associations remained statistically significant (Adjusted odds ratio of 1.94 [95% CI: 1.39–2.96] for PFOS, 2.73 [1.71–4.55] for PFOA, and 2.82 [1.97–3.51] for ∑ (12) PFASs). Urine metabolome-PFASs association analysis revealed that 59% of PFASs-associated urinary endogenous metabolites in COVID-19 patients were identified to be produced or largely regulated by mitochondrial function. In addition, the increase of PFASs exposure was associated with the accumulation of key metabolites in kynurenine metabolism, which are involved in immune responses (Combined β coefficient of 0.60 [95% CI: 0.25–0.95, P = 0.001]). Moreover, alternations in PFASs-associated metabolites in mitochondrial and kynurenine metabolism were also correlated with clinical lab biomarkers for mitochondrial function (serum growth/differentiation factor-15) and immune activity (lymphocyte percentage), respectively. Conclusion: Elevated exposure to PFASs was independently associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. PFASs-associated metabolites were implicated in mitochondrial function and immune activity. Larger studies are needed to confirm our findings and further understand the underlying mechanisms of PFASs exposure in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection. © 2021 The Author(s)",COVID-19; Metabolic abnormalities; Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances; Susceptibility; Urine,"Health; Industrial chemicals; Liquid chromatography; Magnetic susceptibility; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; Risk assessment; COVID-19; Immune activity; Metabolic abnormality; Metabolomes; Mitochondrial function; Odd ratios; Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substance; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Susceptibility; Urine; Metabolism; growth differentiation factor 15; kynurenine; perfluoroalkanoic acid; perfluorobutane sulfonic acid; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorododecanoic acid; perfluoroheptanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluorotetradecanoic acid; perfluorotridecanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; virus RNA; COVID-19; metabolism; organofluorine; pollution exposure; serum; urine; adult; age; albumin to creatinine ratio; amino acid metabolism; Article; body mass; case control study; China; comorbidity; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease predisposition; female; human; immune response; incidence; infection risk; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; major clinical study; male; metabolic fingerprinting; middle aged; mitochondrial respiration; priority journal; sex; epidemiology; liquid chromatography; pandemic; pollutant; tandem mass spectrometry; toxicity; China; Shandong; Shanxi; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Case-Control Studies; China; Chromatography, Liquid; COVID-19; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Pandemics; RNA, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Elsevier Ltd
"Sensors for detecting per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS): A critical review of development challenges, current sensors, and commercialization obstacles","Menger R.F., Funk E., Henry C.S., Borch T.",2021,Chemical Engineering Journal,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of compounds that have become environmental contaminants of emerging concern. They are highly persistent, toxic, bioaccumulative, and ubiquitous which makes them important to detect to ensure environmental and human health. Multiple instrument-based methods exist for sensitive and selective detection of PFAS in a variety of matrices, but these methods suffer from expensive costs and the need for a laboratory and highly trained personnel. There is a big need for fast, inexpensive, robust, and portable methods to detect PFAS in the field. This would allow environmental laboratories and other agencies to perform more frequent testing to comply with regulations. In addition, the general public would benefit from a fast method to evaluate the drinking water in their homes for PFAS contamination. A PFAS sensor would provide almost real-time data on PFAS concentrations that can also provide actionable information for water quality managers and consumers around the planet. In this review, we discuss the sensors that have been developed up to this point for PFAS detection by their molecular detection mechanism as well as the goals that should be considered during sensor development. Future research needs and commercialization challenges are also highlighted. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Fluorosurfactant; Molecularly imprinted polymer; Nanoparticle; PFOA; PFOS; Water quality,Environmental regulations; Industrial laboratories; Nanoparticles; Potable water; Commercialisation; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Critical review; Current sensors; Environmental contaminant; Fluorosurfactants; Molecularly Imprinted Polymer; PFOA; PFOS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Water quality,Elsevier B.V.
Endoscopic stapes surgery outcomes and complication rates: a systematic review,"Bartel R., Sanz J.J., Clemente I., Simonetti G., Viscacillas G., Palomino L., Asarta I., Lao X.",2021,European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology,"Objective: These days, the gold standard procedure for otosclerosis treatment is stapes surgery. The endoscopic approach of the procedure is gaining popularity as endoscopic ear surgery develops across the globe. The main objective of this study is to gather and compile well-documented and reliable data regarding surgical outcomes for the endoscopic approach to stapes surgery up to this date. Materials and methods: Publications in English were searched in the PUBMED/MEDLINE database and were systematically reviewed. A total of 16 articles were reviewed according to the inclusion criteria, obtaining a total of 573 patients managed surgically for otosclerosis, using an endoscopic approach. Data were systematically extracted and compared across variables. Results: Data were obtained as follows: mean age of 43 years; female proportion of 60%; 3 mm endoscope diameter of 51%, 4 mm of 39%; titanium piston-type prostheses of 52% and Teflon of 48%; length of the prosthesis (mode) was 4.5 mm; 0.6 mm diameter of the piston of 81% and 0.4 mm of 19%; mean surgical time was 55 min. Hearing results, mean preoperative air–bone gap (ABG) 31 dB; mean postoperative ABG 9 dB; ABG improvement of 22 dB; an ABG closure rate to 20 dB or less of 92% and an ABG closure rate to 10 dB or less of 77%. Complication rates: intraoperative tympanic membrane perforation of 5%; postoperative vertigo of 11%; postoperative dysgeusia of 10%; reported a postoperative neurosensorial hearing loss of 0.2%; reported gusher phenomenon of one case (0.2%). Conclusion: Endoscopic stapes surgery is completely achievable using 0º angle and 4-mm-diameter sinus surgery endoscope.

The Adipose Tissue at the Crosstalk Between EDCs and Cancer Development,"Bokobza E., Hinault C., Tiroille V., Clavel S., Bost F., Chevalier N.",2021,Frontiers in Endocrinology,"Obesity is a major public health concern at the origin of many pathologies, including cancers. Among them, the incidence of gastro-intestinal tract cancers is significantly increased, as well as the one of hormone-dependent cancers. The metabolic changes caused by overweight mainly with the development of adipose tissue (AT), insulin resistance and chronic inflammation induce hormonal and/or growth factor imbalances, which impact cell proliferation and differentiation. AT is now considered as the main internal source of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) representing a low level systemic chronic exposure. Some EDCs are non-metabolizable and can accumulate in AT for a long time. We are chronically exposed to low doses of EDCs able to interfere with the endocrine metabolism of the body. Importantly, several EDCs have been involved in the genesis of obesity affecting profoundly the physiology of AT. In parallel, EDCs have been implicated in the development of cancers, in particular hormone-dependent cancers (prostate, testis, breast, endometrium, thyroid). While it is now well established that AT secretes adipocytokines that promote tumor progression, it is less clear whether they can initiate cancer. Therefore, it is important to better understand the effects of EDCs, and to investigate the buffering effect of AT in the context of progression but also initiation of cancer cells using adequate models recommended to uncover and validate these mechanisms for humans. We will review and argument here the potential role of AT as a crosstalk between EDCs and hormone-dependent cancer development, and how to assess it. © Copyright © 2021 Bokobza, Hinault, Tiroille, Clavel, Bost and Chevalier.",adipose tissue; cancer; endocrine disrupting chemicals; endocrine disruptor (EDC); model; secretome,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; adipocytokine; androgen; cell nucleus receptor; chemokine receptor CCR3; collagen gel; diethylstilbestrol; dioxin; endocrine disruptor; estrogen; hexachlorobenzene; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; membrane receptor; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; monocyte chemotactic protein 3; perfluorooctanoic acid; platelet derived growth factor; polychlorinated biphenyl; reactive oxygen metabolite; stress activated protein kinase; tributyltin; tumor necrosis factor; vasculotropin; adipocyte; adipose tissue; breast cancer; cancer growth; canonical Wnt signaling; endometrium cancer; endothelium cell; human; hyperplasia; hypertrophy; lipolysis; lipophilicity; mouse; multipotent stem cell; NF kB signaling; nonhuman; obesity; organoid; Pi3K/Akt signaling; prostate cancer; Review; secretomics; systematic review; thyroid cancer; tumor microenvironment; xenograft; zebra fish",Frontiers Media S.A.
Anion exchange resin removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from impacted water: A critical review,"Boyer T.H., Fang Y., Ellis A., Dietz R., Choi Y.J., Schaefer C.E., Higgins C.P., Strathmann T.J.",2021,Water Research,"A key gap in the literature on the treatment of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in impacted water is the absence of a review article dedicated to anion exchange resin (AER) treatment. This gap is important because previous research has consistently shown adsorption by AER to be one of the most effective treatment processes for PFAS removal from impacted water, and AER is one of the most commonly deployed technologies in the field. Given the scope of the previous review articles on PFAS removal by various adsorbent types, the sections on AER do not explore the full depth of PFAS and AER interactions nor cover the breadth of AER testing conditions. Accordingly, the goal of this paper was to critically review the available peer-reviewed literature on PFAS removal from water by AER. The specific objectives of the review were to synthesize the previous literature results on (1) batch adsorption behavior, (2) impact of water chemistry conditions, (3) continuous-flow adsorption, (4) adsorption modeling, (5) regeneration, and (6) weak-base AER. Following from critical review of the literature, the future research priorities discussed include: (i) improving the underlying science that governs PFAS–resin interactions, (ii) improving methods for resin regeneration and management of PFAS-contaminated concentrate streams, and (iii) comparative life cycle environmental and economic analyses for ion exchange treatment systems relative to competing technologies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Natural organic matter; Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS); Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA); Polyacrylic resin; Polystyrene resin; Regeneration,"Adsorption; Biological materials; Economic analysis; Environmental technology; Ion exchange; Ions; Life cycle; Anion exchange resins; Critical review; Natural organic matters; Perfluorooctanesulphonate; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Polyacrylic resins; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Polystyrene resins; Regeneration; Resin removal; Ion exchange resins; adsorbent; anion exchange resin; drinking water; ground water; natural organic matter; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; anion exchange resin; fluorocarbon; water; anion; chemical substance; ion exchange; literature review; pollutant removal; resin; adsorption kinetics; chemical structure; continuous flow adsorption; ion exchange; isotherm; peer review; pH; Review; stoichiometry; water pollution; water treatment; water management; water pollutant; Anion Exchange Resins; Fluorocarbons; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Elsevier Ltd
"Synthesis, structure, and performance of carbide phases in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis: A critical review","Opeyemi Otun K., Yao Y., Liu X., Hildebrandt D.",2021,Fuel,"Iron carbides are of burgeoning interest in both fundamental scientific research and fuel technology due to their electronic, magnetic, and catalytic properties. They are arguably connected with the active phase in iron-based Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS). In FTS, different phases of iron carbide have been identified, including Hägg carbide (χ-Fe5C2), pseudo-hexagonal iron carbide (ἐ-Fe2.2C), hexagonal iron carbide (ɛ-Fe3C), cementite (θ-Fe3C), and Eckstrom-Adcock iron carbide (Fe7C3). However, despite decades of existence of FTS technology, the exact roles played by carbide phases have been the subject of intense debate due to the complex and dynamic nature of carbide phases. This drawback usually frustrates the establishment of a clear-cut structure-perfomance relationship. In light of these concerns, it is very imperative to critically review the challenges and various approaches aimed at demystifying their roles and improving their performance in FTS for sustainable production of clean fuels. First, the structures and essential properties of iron carbides were evaluated and recent research advances in the synthesis of iron carbides were discussed and compared. Second, the structural elucidations of carbide phases using in situ studies, their performances and thermodynamic stability in FT reaction were discussed. Finally, outlooks on future research directions are outlined. This review provides insights into understanding the evolution and performance of carbide phases in FTS, and motivating researchers to further contribute towards designing iron-based FTS catalysts with highly active and selective carbide phase as the predominant phase. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Carbide phases; Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis; Fuel; Hägg carbide; Structure-performance relationship,Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Fuels; Iron compounds; Carbide phasis; Fe$+3+$; Fischer Tropsch; Hagg carbide; Iron carbides; Iron-based; Performance; Structure and performance; Structure-performance relationship; Tropsch synthesis; Carbides,Elsevier Ltd
Carbon xerogels combined with nanotubes as solid-phase extraction sorbent to determine metaflumizone and seven other surface and drinking water micropollutants,"Barbosa M.O., Ribeiro R.S., Ribeiro A.R.L., Pereira M.F.R., Silva A.M.T.",2021,Scientific reports,"Carbon xerogels (CXs) were synthesized by polycondensation of resorcinol and formaldehyde, followed by thermal annealing, and subjected to hydrothermal oxidation. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges were filled with CXs and tested for extraction of metaflumizone and other seven environmental micropollutants (acetamiprid, atrazine, isoproturon, methiocarb, carbamazepine, diclofenac, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) before chromatographic analysis. The recoveries obtained with the pristine CX were low for most analytes, except for metaflumizone (69 ± 5%). Moreover, it was concluded that the adsorption/desorption process of the micropollutants performed better on CXs with a less acidic surface (i.e., pristine CX). Thus, cartridges were prepared with pristine CX and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in a multi-layer configuration. This reusable cartridge was able to simultaneously extract the eight micropollutants and was used to validate an analytical methodology based on SPE followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A widespread occurrence of 6/8 target compounds was observed in surface water collected in rivers supplying three drinking water treatment plants and in the resulting drinking water at the endpoint of each distribution system. Therefore, the first study employing CXs and MWCNTs as sorbent in multi-layer SPE cartridges is herein reported as a proof of concept for determination of multi-class water micropollutants.",,,NLM (Medline)
A comprehensive review on magnetic carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube-based buckypaper for removal of heavy metals and dyes,"Khan F.S.A., Mubarak N.M., Tan Y.H., Khalid M., Karri R.R., Walvekar R., Abdullah E.C., Nizamuddin S., Mazari S.A.",2021,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"Industrial effluents contain several organic and inorganic contaminants. Among others, dyes and heavy metals introduce a serious threat to drinking waterbodies. These pollutants can be noxious or carcinogenic in nature, and harmful to humans and different aquatic species. Therefore, it is of high importance to remove heavy metals and dyes to reduce their environmental toxicity. This has led to an extensive research for the development of novel materials and techniques for the removal of heavy metals and dyes. One route to the removal of these pollutants is the utilization of magnetic carbon nanotubes (CNT) as adsorbents. Magnetic carbon nanotubes hold remarkable properties such as surface-volume ratio, higher surface area, convenient separation methods, etc. The suitable characteristics of magnetic carbon nanotubes have led them to an extensive search for their utilization in water purification. Along with magnetic carbon nanotubes, the buckypaper (BP) membranes are also favorable due to their unique strength, high porosity, and adsorption capability. However, BP membranes are mostly used for salt removal from the aqueous phase and limited literature shows their applications for removal of heavy metals and dyes. This study focuses on the existence of heavy metal ions and dyes in the aquatic environment, and methods for their removal. Various fabrication approaches for the development of magnetic-CNTs and CNT-based BP membranes are also discussed. With the remarkable separation performance and ultra-high-water flux, magnetic-CNTs, and CNT-based BP membranes have a great potential to be the leading technologies for water treatment in future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Buckypaper membrane; Dyes removal; Heavy metals removal; Magnetic carbon nanotubes; Modification approaches,Chemicals removal (water treatment); Effluents; Heavy metals; Magnetism; Metal ions; Pollution; Salt removal; Sewage; Stripping (dyes); Adsorption capability; Aquatic environments; Environmental toxicity; Industrial effluent; Inorganic contaminants; Leading technology; Magnetic carbon nanotubes; Separation performance; Carbon nanotubes; anthraquinone; antibiotic agent; arsenic; cadmium; carbon nanotube; chlorine; chromium; cobalt; copper; cosmetic; dye; fertilizer; fulvic acid; gasoline; heavy metal; humic acid; industrial effluent; ink; insecticide; lead; magnetic carbon nanotube; manganese; mercury; nickel; organomercury compound; paint; perfluoro compound; pesticide; phthalocyanine; single walled nanotube; solvent; steroid; sulfur; triphenylmethane; unclassified drug; zinc; carbon nanotube; detection method; dye; heavy metal; pollutant removal; purification; toxicity; adsorption; aquatic environment; aquatic species; arsenic poisoning; arthralgia; asthma; bone malformation; buckypaper membrane; chemical carcinogenesis; coma; degradation; depression; disinfection; drinking; electrospinning; filtration; flocculation; gas chromatography; gastrointestinal disease; hair loss; headache; health hazard; heavy metal poisoning; heavy metal removal; high performance liquid chromatography; human; hypertension; industrial waste; industrialization; infertility; ion exchange; kidney injury; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; malignant neoplasm; membrane; Minamata disease; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; phytotoxicity; pollutant; porosity; respiratory tract infection; reverse osmosis; Review; sedimentation; skin allergy; supercritical fluid chromatography; surface area; tandem mass spectrometry; ultra performance liquid chromatography; water pollutant; water pollution; water quality; water transport; water treatment,Elsevier B.V.
A roadmap to the structure-related metabolism pathways of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in the early life stages of Zebrafish (Danio Rerio),"Han J., Gu W., Barrett H., Yang D., Tang S., Sun J., Liu J., Krause H.M., Houck K.A., Peng H.",2021,Environmental Health Perspectives,"Background: Thousands of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with diverse structures have been detected in the ambient environment. Apart from a few well-studied PFAS, the structure-related toxicokinetics of a broader set of PFAS remain unclear. Objectives: To understand the toxicokinetics of PFAS, we attempted to characterize the metabolism pathways of 74 structurally diverse PFAS samples from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s PFAS screening library. Methods: Using the early life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model, we determined the bioconcentration factors and phenotypic toxicities of 74 PFAS. Then, we applied high-resolution mass spectrometry-based nontargeted analysis to identify metabolites of PFAS in zebrafish larvae after 5 d of exposure by incorporating retention time and mass spectra. In vitro enzymatic activity experiments with human recombinant liver carboxylesterase (hCES1) were employed to validate the structure-related hydrolysis of 11 selected PFAS. Results: Our findings identified five structural categories of PFAS prone to metabolism. The metabolism pathways of PFAS were highly related to their structures as exemplified by fluorotelomer alcohols that the predominance of β-oxidation or taurine conjugation pathways were primarily determined by the number of hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis was identified as a major metabolism pathway for diverse PFAS, and perfluoroalkyl carboxamides showed the highest in vivo hydrolysis rates, followed by carboxyesters and sulfonamides. The hydrolysis of PFAS was verified with recombinant hCES1, with strong substrate preferences toward perfluoroalkyl carboxamides. Conclusions: We suggest that the roadmap of the structure-related metabolism pathways of PFAS established in this study would provide a starting point to inform the potential health risks of other PFAS. © 2021, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

How could perfluorocarbon affect cytokine storm and angiogenesis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α,"Moasefi N., Fouladi M., Norooznezhad A.H., Yarani R., Rahmani A., Mansouri K.",2021,Inflammation Research,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still a world-class challenge. Inflammation, especially its severe form with excess release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm) which is a life-threatening condition, is among the most important suspects involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis. It has been shown that cytokine storm could cause notable morbidities such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which leads to hypoxia which is significantly associated with mortality of patients with COVID-19. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) which activates following ARDS-induced hypoxia plays a crucial role in pathogenesis of cytokine storm. The expression of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1 β (IL-1β), and IL-6 which are key elements of cytokine storm are by nuclear factor κβ (NFκB). Interestingly, during the hypoxia, HIF-1α activates NFκB to induce expression of pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory factors. These released factors starts a autocrine/paracrine loop and causes deterioration of their etiological pathways of expression: cytokine storm and ARDS. To sum up, it seems HIF-1α is an important target to hit to ameliorate the mentioned pathways. Herein, we suggest perfluorocarbons (PFCs) which are among the organofluorine compounds as a possible co-treatment to reduce hypoxemia and then hypoxia. These substances are known for their high gas solving potential that make them able to be used as a synthetic artificial blood product. Due to the potential of PFCs to affect the fountain of important physiopathological pathway such as inflammation a hypoxia through affecting NFκB, they could be considered as multi-target co-treatment for ARD individuals with COVID-19. It is highly suggested to evaluate this hypothesis in following researches. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Cytokine storm; HIF-1α; Hypoxia; Inflammation; Perfluorocarbon,"fluorocarbon; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; tumor necrosis factor; cytokine; fluorocarbon; HIF1A protein, human; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; protective agent; adult respiratory distress syndrome; angiogenesis; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine response; cytokine storm; human; hypoxemia; hypoxia; inflammation; Note; protein function; systematic review (topic); animal; biosynthesis; cytokine release syndrome; drug effect; hypoxia; metabolism; neovascularization (pathology); respiratory distress syndrome; Animals; COVID-19; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Cytokines; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Hypoxia; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Neovascularization, Pathologic; NF-kappa B; Protective Agents; Respiratory Distress Syndrome",Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
"A review of the occurrence, transformation, and removal of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in wastewater treatment plants","Lenka S.P., Kah M., Padhye L.P.",2021,Water Research,"Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) comprise more than 4,000 anthropogenically manufactured compounds with widescale consumer and industrial applications. This critical review compiles the latest information on the worldwide distribution of PFAS and evaluates their fate in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). A large proportion (>30%) of monitoring studies in WWTPs were conducted in China, followed by Europe (30%) and North America (16%), whereas information is generally lacking for other parts of the world, including most of the developing countries. Short and long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) were widely detected in both the influents (up to 1,000 ng/L) and effluents (15 to >1,500 ng/L) of WWTPs. To date, limited data is available regarding levels of PFAS precursors and ultra-short chain PFAS in WWTPs. Most WWTPs exhibited low removal efficiencies for PFAS, and many studies reported an increase in the levels of PFAAs after wastewater treatment. The analysis of the fate of various classes of PFAS at different wastewater treatment stages (aerobic and/aerobic biodegradation, photodegradation, and chemical degradation) revealed biodegradation as the primary mechanism responsible for the transformation of PFAS precursors to PFAAs in WWTPs. Remediation studies at full scale and laboratory scale suggest advanced processes such as adsorption using ion exchange resins, electrochemical degradation, and nanofiltration are more effective in removing PFAS (~95–100%) than conventional processes. However, the applicability of such treatments for real-world WWTPs faces significant challenges due to the scaling-up requirements, mass-transfer limitations, and management of treatment by-products and wastes. Combining more than one technique for effective removal of PFAS, while addressing limitations of the individual treatments, could be beneficial. Considering environmental concentrations of PFAS, cost-effectiveness, and ease of operation, nanofiltration followed by adsorption using wood-derived biochar and/or activated carbons could be a viable option if introduced to conventional treatment systems. However, the large-scale applicability of the same needs to be further verified. © 2021",Adsorption; Biodegradation; Precursors; Short-chain PFAS; Ultra-short chain PFAS; WWTP,"Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Adsorption; Biodegradation; Chemical analysis; Cost effectiveness; Developing countries; Effluents; Ion exchange; Mass transfer; Nanofiltration; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater treatment; Water filtration; Critical review; Long chains; Perfluoroalkyl acids; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Precursor; Short-chain perfluoroalkyl substance; Shorter chains; Ultra-short chain perfluoroalkyl substance; Water treatment plants; fluorocarbon; China; environmental monitoring; Europe; wastewater; water management; water pollutant; China; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Fluorocarbons; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Elsevier Ltd
"Comparative analysis of the physicochemical, toxicokinetic, and toxicological properties of ether-PFAS","Rice P.A., Cooper J., Koh-Fallet S.E., Kabadi S.V.",2021,Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology,"Perfluoropolyethers, also known as ether-PFAS, are linear or branched alkyl ether polymers, where the substituent hydrogens on the carbon atoms in the chain have been fully replaced by fluorine atoms. Some of these molecules may have a carboxylate functional group attached to one of the terminal carbon atoms to form an ether-PFAS carboxylate. Perfluoropolyethers are used as processing aids in the manufacture of various types of perfluorinated polymeric materials which are used in a variety of consumer applications. Although the physicochemical and toxicological properties of certain perfluoropolyether compounds have been extensively studied, data are relatively sparse for some members of this class of compounds. Moreover, the physicochemical, toxicokinetic, and toxicological properties of ether-PFAS as a class have not been elucidated in previous comprehensive review articles. This article reviews the nomenclature and uses of ether-PFAS and compares the physicochemical properties, toxicokinetic characteristics, apical effects in toxicological studies, and dose-response profiles across four specific ether-PFAS compounds. This comparison, including a description of identified data gaps should help to inform the design of studies to further elucidate the characteristics of ether-PFAS and to propose potential read-across assessment strategies for members of this class. © 2021",ADONA; EEA-NH4; Ether-PFAS; GENX; HFPO-DA,"ether; serpacwa; ether derivative; fluorocarbon; perfluoropolyether; absorption; comparative study; human; immune system; liver tissue; metabolism; nomenclature; physical chemistry; postnatal development; Review; target organ; toxicity testing; toxicokinetics; animal; chemical structure; chemistry; dose response; pollutant; risk assessment; structure activity relation; toxicity; toxicokinetics; Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Environmental Pollutants; Ethers; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Molecular Structure; Risk Assessment; Structure-Activity Relationship; Toxicity Tests; Toxicokinetics",Academic Press Inc.
Onlay Patellofemoral Arthroplasty in Patients With Isolated Patellofemoral Arthritis: A Systematic Review,"Villa J.C., Paoli A.R., Nelson-Williams H.W., Badr R.N., Harper K.D.",2021,Journal of Arthroplasty,"Background: Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) for isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (OA) remains controversial due to variable postoperative outcomes and high failure rates. Second-generation (2G) onlay prostheses have been associated with improved postoperative outcomes. This systematic review was performed to assess the current overall survivorship and functional outcomes of 2G PFA. Methods: A search was performed using PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Thirty-three studies published in the last 15 years (2005-2020) were included; of these 22 studies reported patient-reported outcome measures. Operative and nonoperative complications were analyzed. Pooled statistical analysis was performed for survivorship and functional scores using Excel 2016 and Stata 13. Results: The mean age of the patients was 59.7. When analyzing all studies, weighted survival at mean follow-up of 5.52 was 87.72%. Subanalysis of studies with minimum 5 years of follow up showed a survival of 94.24%. Fifteen studies reported Oxford Knee Score with a weighted mean postoperative Oxford Knee Score of 33.59. Mean American Knee Society Score pain was 79.7 while mean American Knee Society Score function was 79.3. The most common operative complication was OA progression for all implants. The percentage of revisions and conversions reported after analyzing all studies was 1.37% and 7.82% respectively. Conclusion: Safe and acceptable results of functional outcomes and PFA survivorship can result from 2G PFAs at both short and mid-term follow-up for patients with isolated patellofemoral OA. However, long-term follow-up outcomes are still pending for the newer implants. More extensive studies using standardized functional outcomes and long-term cost benefits should be evaluated. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",complications; functional outcomes; patellofemoral arthroplasty; patellofemoral osteoarthritis; survivorship,"American Knee Society Score; arthroplasty; arthroscopy; Article; articular cartilage; biomechanics; clinical assessment; clinical outcome; femoral condyle; follow up; human; infection complication; knee osteoarthritis; knee pain; meta analysis; osteoarthritis; osteotomy; Oxford Knee Score; patellofemoral joint; peroperative complication; prevalence; randomized controlled trial (topic); range of motion; scoring system; stair climbing; survival rate; systematic review; total knee arthroplasty; walking distance; adverse device effect; adverse event; knee osteoarthritis; knee prosthesis; knee replacement; treatment outcome; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Prosthesis; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Patellofemoral Joint; Treatment Outcome",Elsevier B.V.
Emerging pollutants in Nigeria: A systematic review,"Egbuna C., Amadi C.N., Patrick-Iwuanyanwu K.C., Ezzat S.M., Awuchi C.G., Ugonwa P.O., Orisakwe O.E.",2021,Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology,"Emerging pollutants represent a group of synthetic or naturally occurring compounds that are not normally monitored within the environment but can enter into the environment and cause different adverse ecological and health effects. This systematic review identified the various emerging pollutants in Nigeria. The following databases, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Google Scholar, and African Journals OnLine (AJOL) were searched to identify studies on pollutants of emerging concerns in Nigeria. A total of 933 articles were identified out of which 30 articles were selected to be eligible for the study. Over 250 emerging pollutants were identified and divided into 9 major groups which are personal care products, pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, pesticides, mycotoxins, radionuclides and electromagnetic radiations (Gamma radiation) and other pollutants of emerging concerns such as microbes, microplastics, and particulate matter. These pollutants are found in water bodies and underground waters, soils and sediments, biological systems, and ambient air at different concentrations with seasonal variations. Some of these pollutants act as endocrine disruptors, β-adrenergic receptors agonist blockers, oxidative stress inducers and can cause genetic alterations in DNA and epigenetic reprogramming through global DNA methylation, gene-specific CpG methylation and microRNA expression.

Nanoremediation technologies for sustainable remediation of contaminated environments: Recent advances and challenges,"Ganie A.S., Bano S., Khan N., Sultana S., Rehman Z., Rahman M.M., Sabir S., Coulon F., Khan M.Z.",2021,Chemosphere,"A major and growing concern within society is the lack of innovative and effective solutions to mitigate the challenge of environmental pollution. Uncontrolled release of pollutants into the environment as a result of urbanisation and industrialisation is a staggering problem of global concern. Although, the eco-toxicity of nanotechnology is still an issue of debate, however, nanoremediation is a promising emerging technology to tackle environmental contamination, especially dealing with recalcitrant contaminants. Nanoremediation represents an innovative approach for safe and sustainable remediation of persistent organic compounds such as pesticides, chlorinated solvents, brominated or halogenated chemicals, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and heavy metals. This comprehensive review article provides a critical outlook on the recent advances and future perspectives of nanoremediation technologies such as photocatalysis, nano-sensing etc., applied for environmental decontamination. Moreover, sustainability assessment of nanoremediation technologies was taken into consideration for tackling legacy contamination with special focus on health and environmental impacts.

Pelvic floor: vaginal or caesarean delivery? A review of systematic reviews,"López-López A.I., Sanz-Valero J., Gómez-Pérez L., Pastor-Valero M.",2021,International Urogynecology Journal,"Introduction and hypothesis: In recent years the number of caesarean sections has increased worldwide for different reasons. to review the scientific evidence relating to the impact of the type of delivery on pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) such as urinary and faecal incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. Methods: A review of systematic reviews and meta-analysis, drawn from the following databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library and LILACS (Literatura Latinoamericana y del Caribe en Ciencias de la Salud/Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) prior to January 2019. The directives of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses were used in assessing article quality. Results: Eleven systematic reviews were evaluated, 6 of which found a significantly decreased risk of urinary incontinence associated with caesarean section and 3 meta-analyses showed a significant reduction in POP for caesarean section, compared with vaginal delivery. Of 5 reviews that examined delivery type and faecal incontinence, only one indicated a lower incidence of faecal incontinence associated with caesarean delivery. However, most of the studies included in these reviews were not adjusted for important confounding factors and the risk of PFDs was not analysed by category of caesarean delivery (elective or urgent). Conclusion: When compared with vaginal delivery, caesarean is associated with a reduced risk of urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. These results should be interpreted with caution and do not help to address the question of whether elective caesareans are protective of the maternal pelvic floor. © 2020, The International Urogynecological Association.",Cesarean section; Delivery; Fecal incontinence; Obstetric; Parturition; Pelvic floor; Urinary incontinence,"cesarean section; feces incontinence; female; human; pelvic organ prolapse; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; Review; systematic review; urine incontinence; vaginal delivery; adverse event; cesarean section; feces incontinence; meta analysis; obstetric delivery; pelvic floor disorder; pelvic organ prolapse; pelvis floor; pregnancy; Cesarean Section; Delivery, Obstetric; Fecal Incontinence; Female; Humans; Pelvic Floor; Pelvic Floor Disorders; Pelvic Organ Prolapse; Pregnancy",Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH

This review focuses on the broad classifications of membrane materials and the criteria for the selection of membrane materials, describes the various synthesis routes adopted for membrane fabrication, and explains various gas transport mechanisms. A comparison of membrane-based separation technology with other conventional technologies has also been made. The review also discusses the current polymers used for gas separations, current commercially viable membrane-based gas separation processes, and various limitations associated with the development of membrane material and separation processes. Further, various new classes of membranes developed for gas separations, including thermally rearranged polymers, polymers of intrinsic microporosity, room temperature ionic liquids, perfluoro polymers, and mixed matrix membranes, that has high separation performance has also been discussed.

Coordination of the Co2+and Ni2+Ions in Tf2N-Based Ionic Liquids: A Combined X-ray Absorption and Molecular Dynamics Study,"Busato M., Lapi A., D’Angelo P., Melchior A.",2021,Journal of Physical Chemistry B,"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) have been combined to study the coordination of the Co2+and Ni2+ions in ionic liquids (ILs) based on the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Tf2N]−) anion and having different organic cations, namely, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium ([C4mim]+), 1,8-bis(3-methylimidazolium-1-yl)octane ([C8(mim)2]2+),N,N,N-trimethyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ammonium ([choline]+), and butyltrimethylammonium ([BTMA]+). Co and Ni K-edge XAS data have been collected on 0.1 mol L-1Co(Tf2N)2and Ni(Tf2N)2solutions and on the metallic salts. MD simulations have been carried out to obtain structural information on the metal ion coordination. The analysis of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of the solutions has been carried out based on the atomistic description provided by MD, and the studied ILs have been found to be able to dissolve both the Co(Tf2N)2and Ni(Tf2N)2salts giving rise to a different structural arrangement around the metal ions as compared to the solid state. The combined EXAFS and MD results showed that the Co2+and Ni2+ions are surrounded by a first solvation shell formed by six [Tf2N]−anions, each coordinating in a monodentate fashion by means of the oxygen atoms. The nature of the IL organic cation has little or no influence on the overall spatial arrangement of the [Tf2N]−anions, so that stable octahedral complexes of the type [M(Tf2N)6]4-(M = Co, Ni) have been observed in all the investigated ILs. © 2021 The Authors.

"Past, present, and future perspectives on the assessment of bioavailability/bioaccessibility of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: A 20-year systemic review based on scientific econometrics","Chen X., Cheng X., Meng H., Selvaraj K.K., Li H., He H., Du W., Yang S., Li S., Zhang L.",2021,Science of the Total Environment,"Bioaccessibility/bioavailability (bioac-bioav) is an important criterion in the risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), especially in the restoration of contaminated sites. Although, the bioac-bioav concept is widely employed in PAH risk assessment for both humans and wildlife, their growth and integration in risk assessment models are seldom discussed. Consequently, the relevant literature listed on Web of Science (WOS)™ was retrieved and analyzed using the bibliometric software Citespace in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of this issue. Due to the limitations of the literature search software, we manually searched the articles about PAHs bioac-bioav that were published before 2000. This stage focuses on research on the distribution coefficient of PAHs between different environmental phases and laid the foundation for the adsorption-desorption of PAHs in subsequent studies of the bioac-bioav of PAHs. The research progress on PAH bioac-bioav from 2000 to the present was evaluated using the Citespace software based on country- and discipline-wise publication volumes and research hotspots. The development stages of PAH bioac-bioav after 2000 were divided into four time segments. The first three segments (2000–2005, 2006–2010, and 2011–2015) focused on the degradation of PAHs and their in vivo (bioavailability)-in vitro (bioaccessibility) evaluation method and risk assessment. Meanwhile, the current (2016–present) research focuses on the establishment of analytical methods for assessing PAH derivatives at environmental concentrations and the optimization of various in vitro digestion methods, including chemical optimization (sorptive sink) and biological optimization (Caco-2 cell).

Epigenetic changes by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),"Kim S., Thapar I., Brooks B.W.",2021,Environmental Pollution,"Increasing studies are examining per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) induced toxicity and resulting health outcomes, including epigenetic modifications (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modification, microRNA expression). We critically reviewed current evidence from human epidemiological, in vitro, and animal studies, including mammalian and aquatic model organisms. Epidemiological studies identified the associations between perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure and epigenetic changes in both adult populations and birth cohorts. For in vitro studies, various cell types including neuroblasts, preadipocytes, and hepatocytes have been employed to understand epigenetic effects of PFAS. In studies with animal models, effects of early life exposure to PFAS have been examined using rodent models, and aquatic models (e.g., zebrafish) have been more frequently used in recent years. Several studies highlighted oxidative stress as a key mediator between epigenetic modification and health effects. Collectively, previous research clearly suggest involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in PFAS induced toxicity, though these efforts have primarily focused on specific PFASs (i.e. mainly PFOS and PFOA) or endpoints (i.e. cancer). Additional studies are necessary to define specific linkages among epigenetic mechanisms and related biomarkers or phenotypical changes. In addition, future research is also needed for understudied PFAS and complex mixtures. Studies of epigenetic effects elicited by individual PFAS and mixtures are needed within an adverse outcome pathways framework, which will advance an understanding of PFAS risks to public health and the environment, and support efforts to design less hazardous chemicals. © 2021 Elsevier LtdPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) can elicit epigenetic alterations, yet available evidence is limited to a few commonly studied compounds.

Technologies towards antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) removal from aquatic environment: A critical review,"Li S., Zhang C., Li F., Hua T., Zhou Q., Ho S.-H.",2021,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been recognized as emerging pollutants that are widely distributed and accumulated in most of aquatic environment. Although many ARGs-removal technologies are employed, a corresponding discussion of merits and limitations of known technologies is still currently lacking. More importantly, the removal mechanisms of ARGs remain unclear, hindering their ecological feasibility. Thus, further in-depth studies are highly required. In this review, the occurrence and risk of ARGs in aquatic environment are introduced, and the main routes and potential impacts of ARGs dissemination are enumerated. In addition, several novel ARGs detection methods are critically reviewed. Notably, to ensure greater applicability of these technologies, systematic information on how recent technologies impact the ARGs removal and control are comprehensively compared and summarized. Finally, future research directions to alleviate the risk of ARGs in aquatic environment are briefly introduced. Taken together, this review provides useful information to facilitate the development of innovative and feasible ARGs removal technologies and increase their economic viability and ecological sustainability. © 2021",Antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs); Aquatic environment; ARGs detection method; ARGs removal technology; Horizontal gene transfer,"Antibiotics; Ecology; Genes; Antibiotic resistance genes; Aquatic environments; Ecological sustainability; Economic viability; Emerging pollutants; Future research directions; Potential impacts; Removal mechanism; Sustainable development; antibiotics; aquatic ecosystem; feasibility study; gene expression; gene flow; pollutant removal; viability; antibiotic resistance; aquatic environment; article; feasibility study; genetic susceptibility; horizontal gene transfer; pollutant; antibiotic resistance; bacterial gene; genetics; antiinfective agent; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Genes, Bacterial",Elsevier B.V.
Chemical contaminants in Brazilian drinking water: A systematic review,"Zini L.B., Gutterres M.",2021,Journal of Water and Health,"The goals of this research are to evaluate which chemical contaminations were detected in Brazil’s drinking water reported in papers published from 2012 to 2019, to propose guideline values for emerging contaminants and assess which are the priority parameters from a health risk perspective. The methodology used was a systematic review. The chemical contaminants quantified were evaluated according to Brazilian drinking-water standards, and Guideline Values were proposed for emerging pollutants using conservative endpoints from NOAEL and LOAEL available in literature. From 1351 articles evaluated, 15 reached the research goal. Seventy-seven parameters were quantified in Brazilian drinking water from underground, surface and rainwater sources. Soil composition, mining, sewage and agricultural activities were the main sources for the seven classes framed: pesticides, metals, organic, endocrine disruptors, drugs, personal care products and illicit drugs. Twenty-two parameters are listed in the current Brazilian drinking water quality standard and 54 are not. Water was not considered appropriate to drink due to cadmium, aluminum, iron, nickel, mercury, atrazine, propionaldehyde, beryllium, acetone and 17 α-ethinyl estradiol (carcinogenic). Measures to reduce chemical contamination in drinking water need to be taken such as the expansion of sewage treatment and upgrading to tertiary treatment, and controlling and reducing the application of pesticides. © 2021 IWA Publishing.

Inclusion of maintenance energy improves the intracellular flux predictions of CHO,"Széliová D., Štor J., Thiel I., Weinguny M., Hanscho M., Lhota G., Borth N., Zanghellini J., Ruckerbauer D.E., Rocha I.",2021,PLoS Computational Biology,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the leading platform for the production of biopharmaceuticals with human-like glycosylation. The standard practice for cell line generation relies on trial and error approaches such as adaptive evolution and high-throughput screening, which typically take several months. Metabolic modeling could aid in designing better producer cell lines and thus shorten development times. The genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) of CHO can accurately predict growth rates. However, in order to predict rational engineering strategies it also needs to accurately predict intracellular fluxes. In this work we evaluated the agreement between the fluxes predicted by parsimonious flux balance analysis (pFBA) using the CHO GSMM and a wide range of 13C metabolic flux data from literature. While glycolytic fluxes were predicted relatively well, the fluxes of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were vastly underestimated due to too low energy demand. Inclusion of computationally estimated maintenance energy significantly improved the overall accuracy of intracellular flux predictions. Maintenance energy was therefore determined experimentally by running continuous cultures at different growth rates and evaluating their respective energy consumption. The experimentally and computationally determined maintenance energy were in good agreement. Additionally, we compared alternative objective functions (minimization of uptake rates of seven nonessential metabolites) to the biomass objective. While the predictions of the uptake rates were quite inaccurate for most objectives, the predictions of the intracellular fluxes were comparable to the biomass objective function.

"Application of tio2‐based photocatalysts to antibiotics degradation: Cases of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin","Kutuzova A., Dontsova T., Kwapinski W.",2021,Catalysts,"The extensive application of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has led to their widespread occurrence in a natural aquatic environment. Global health crisis is associated with the fast development of antimicrobial resistance, as more and more infectious diseases cannot be treated more than once. Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin are the most commonly detected antibiotics in water systems worldwide. The persistent and toxic nature of these antibiotics makes their elimination by conventional treatment methods at wastewater treatment plants almost impossible. The application of advanced oxidation processes and heterogeneous photocatalysis over TiO2‐based materials is a promising solution. This highly efficient technology has the potential to be sustainable, cost‐efficient and energy‐efficient. A comprehensive review on the application of various TiO2‐based photocatalysts for the degradation of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin is focused on highlighting their photocatalytic performance under various reaction conditions (different amounts of pollutant and photocatalyst, pH, light source, reaction media, presence of inorganic ions, natural organic matter, oxidants). Mineralization efficiency and ecotoxicity of final products have been also considered. Further research needs have been presented based on the literature findings. Among them, design and development of highly efficient under sunlight, stable, recyclable and cost‐effective TiO2‐based materials; usage of real wastewaters for photocata-lytic tests; and compulsory assessment of products ecotoxicity are the most important research tasks in order to meet requirements for industrial application. © 2021 by the authors.

Fingerprinting Plastic-Associated Inorganic and Organic Matter on Plastic Aged in the Marine Environment for a Decade,"Bhagwat G., Carbery M., Anh Tran T.K., Grainge I., O'Connor W., Palanisami T.",2021,Environmental Science and Technology,"The long-term aging of plastic leads to weathering and biofouling that can influence the behavior and fate of plastic in the marine environment. This is the first study to fingerprint the contaminant profiles and bacterial communities present in plastic-associated inorganic and organic matter (PIOM) isolated from 10 year-aged plastic. Plastic sleeves were sampled from an oyster aquaculture farm and the PIOM was isolated from the intertidal, subtidal, and sediment-buried segments to investigate the levels of metal(loid)s, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), per-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and explore the microbial community composition. Results indicated that the PIOM present on long-term aged high-density polyethylene plastic harbored high concentrations of metal(loid)s, PAHs, and PFAS. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the bacterial composition in the PIOM differed by habitat type, which consisted of potentially pathogenic taxa including Vibrio, Shewanella, and Psychrobacter. This study provides new insights into PIOM as a potential sink for hazardous environmental contaminants and its role in enhancing the vector potential of plastic. Therefore, we recommend the inclusion of PIOM analysis in current biomonitoring regimes and that plastics be used with caution in aquaculture settings to safeguard valuable food resources, particularly in areas of point-source contamination. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",aging; aquaculture; mixed contaminants; plastic pollution; plastisphere; weathering,"Aquaculture; Bacteria; Biogeochemistry; Bacterial community; Bacterial composition; Environmental contaminant; Marine environment; Metagenomic analysis; Microbial community composition; Oyster aquaculture; Polyaromatic hydrocarbons; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; decadal variation; inorganic matter; marine environment; organic matter; plastic waste; Bacteria (microorganisms); Ostreidae; Psychrobacter; Shewanella; Vibrio; plastic; polyethylene; sea water; bacterium; environmental monitoring; genetics; microflora; water pollutant; Bacteria; Environmental Monitoring; Microbiota; Plastics; Polyethylene; Seawater; Water Pollutants, Chemical",American Chemical Society
Fate and transport of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in the vadose zone,"Sharifan H., Bagheri M., Wang D., Burken J.G., Higgins C.P., Liang Y., Liu J., Schaefer C.E., Blotevogel J.",2021,Science of the Total Environment,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a heterogeneous group of persistent organic pollutants that have been detected in various environmental compartments around the globe. Emerging research has revealed the preferential accumulation of PFASs in shallow soil horizons, particularly at sites impacted by firefighting activities, agricultural applications, and atmospheric deposition. Once in the vadose zone, PFASs can sorb to soil, accumulate at interfaces, become volatilized, be taken up in biota, or leach to the underlying aquifer. At the same time, polyfluorinated precursor species may transform into highly recalcitrant perfluoroalkyl acids, changing their chemical identity and thus transport behavior along the way. In this review, we critically discuss the current state of the knowledge and aim to interconnect the complex processes that control the fate and transport of PFASs in the vadose zone. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and future research needs. Consequently, this review may serve as an interdisciplinary guide for the risk assessment and management of PFAS-contaminated sites. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Air-water interface; Biodegradation; Microbial community impact; PFAS sources; Plant uptake; Sorption,Agricultural robots; Aquifers; Meteorological problems; Risk assessment; Soils; Atmospheric depositions; Contaminated sites; Environmental compartment; Fate and transport; Perfluoroalkyl acids; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Risk assessment and managements; Organic pollutants; chemical compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; water; air-water interaction; biodegradation; biological uptake; environmental fate; microbial community; pollutant source; pollutant transport; soil horizon; sorption; vadose zone; air; anaerobic metabolism; aquifer; atmospheric deposition; biodegradability; bioremediation; biota; biotransformation; chemical interaction; chemical modification; chemical parameters; chemical phenomena; community structure; earthworm; environment; environmental impact; environmental management; foam; microbial activity; microbial community; microorganism; nonhuman; plant metabolism; plant physiology; plant root; Review; risk assessment; soil acidity; soil pollutant; soil pollution; surface property; vadose zone; volatilization,Elsevier B.V.
13C isotope-based metabolic flux analysis revealing cellular landscape of glucose metabolism in human liver cells exposed to perfluorooctanoic acid,"Zhang R., Chen B., Lin L., Zhang H., Luan T.",2021,Science of the Total Environment,"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is well known to break glucose homeostasis. However, the effects of PFOA on glucose metabolism are difficult to be evaluated because related metabolites may be synthesized from other nutritional substrates. Here, the relative contribution of glucose to metabolites (e.g., pyruvate and citrate) in the PFOA-treated human liver cells (HepG2) was determined using the 13C isotope-based metabolic flux analysis (MFA), i.e., pathway activities. The relative percentage of [U-13C6] glucose-derived pyruvate in cells exposed to PFOA was not significantly different from that in the controls, indicating that the metabolic pattern of glycolysis was not substantially changed by PFOA. The pathway activity of [U-13C6] glucose-driven tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was dramatically inhibited by PFOA. Consequently, mitochondrial respiratory function was phenotypically impaired by PFOA, as observed from the decreasing basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ATP-linked OCR and spare respiratory capacity. This study suggests that PFOA may cause the abnormal glucose metabolism via altering the metabolic pattern of TCA cycle instead of glycolysis. The MFA is strongly recommended as a promising and robust tool to address the toxicity mechanisms of contaminants associated with glucose metabolism. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Cell respiration; Metabolic flux analysis; Mitochondria; PFOA; TCA cycle,Glucose; Isotopes; Metabolites; Pathology; Glucose homeostasis; Metabolic flux analysis; Oxygen consumption rate; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Relative contribution; Respiratory function; Toxicity mechanisms; Tricarboxylic acids; Metabolism; adenosine triphosphate; carbon 13; citric acid; glucose; perfluorooctanoic acid; pyruvic acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; fluorocarbon; isotope; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; carbon isotope; cell; glucose; homeostasis; metabolism; metabolite; mitochondrion; phenotype; respiration; Article; basal metabolic rate; cell viability; citric acid cycle; controlled study; cytotoxicity; fatty acid synthesis; glucose metabolism; glycolysis; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; metabolic flux analysis; mitochondrial respiration; phenotype; priority journal; liver; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Glucose; Humans; Isotopes; Liver; Metabolic Flux Analysis,Elsevier B.V.
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) caused oxidative stress and metabolic disorders in lettuce (Lactuca sativa) root,"Li P., Li J.",2021,Science of the Total Environment,"Eliminating the critical knowledge gaps of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) effects in planta is the imperative target to accomplish accurate and meaningful exposure-risk assessment in the environment. Here, we investigated the effect of environmentally relevant concentrations of PFOA on the oxidative stress and metabolic regulation in lettuce (Lactuca sativa) root. Under the exposure to 5 and 50 μg/L PFOA for 10 days, 137.5 and 1275.0 ng PFOA/g dry weight were accumulated to roots, respectively. H2O2, the dominant reactive oxygen species, was slightly over-generated by 4.7%–9.5%. No signs of oxidative damage, such as lipid peroxidation, cell membrane integrity and soluble protein content, were observed. To deal with PFOA stress, the activities of ascorbate peroxidase and peroxidase and the contents of glutathione were dose-dependently up-regulated. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis revealed metabolite profiles were significantly altered by PFOA, involving the primary metabolism (e.g., sucrose, glucose, fructose-6-phosphate, methionine, γ-aminobutyric acid), and the biosynthesis of (poly)phenol (e.g., shikimate, naringenin) and alkaloid (e.g., geranyl diphosphate, dopamine). Our findings showed that environmentally relevant concentrations of PFOA significantly perturbed metabolisms in plant roots albeit no remarkable cell damage was induced. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Metabolomics; Oxidative stress; Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA); Phytotoxicity; Plant root; Risk assessment,Amines; Amino acids; Cytology; Discriminant analysis; Flavonoids; Hydrogen peroxide; Least squares approximations; Metabolism; Metabolites; Oxidative stress; Risk assessment; Ascorbate peroxidase; Gamma-aminobutyric acids; Membrane integrity; Metabolic disorders; Metabolic regulations; Metabolite profiles; Partial least squares - discriminant analysis; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Chemical resistance; ascorbate peroxidase; glutathione; hydrogen peroxide; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxidase; reactive oxygen metabolite; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; carboxylic acid; discriminant analysis; leafy vegetable; metabolism; oxidative stress; phytotoxicity; risk assessment; root; Article; biosynthesis; cell membrane; concentration (parameter); controlled study; dry weight; enzyme activity; exposure; lettuce; lipid peroxidation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; metabolic disorder; metabolism; metabolomics; nonhuman; oxidative stress; plant root; primary metabolism; priority journal; protein content; secondary metabolism; upregulation; human; lettuce; oxidative stress; Lactuca; Lactuca sativa; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Lettuce; Metabolic Diseases; Oxidative Stress,Elsevier B.V.
"Combined effects of polyethylene and organic contaminant on zebrafish (Danio rerio): Accumulation of 9-Nitroanthracene, biomarkers and intestinal microbiota","Zhang J., Meng H., Kong X., Cheng X., Ma T., He H., Du W., Yang S., Li S., Zhang L.",2021,Environmental Pollution,"Microplastics, as emerging pollutant, are predicted to act as carriers for organic pollutants, but the carrier role and bio-toxic effects with other pollutants in environments are poorly acknowledged. In this study, both the single and combined effects of polyethylene (PE, 10 and 40 mg/L) with the particle size of 100–150 μm and 9-Nitroanthracene (9-NAnt, 5 and 500 μg/L) on zebrafish (Danio rerio) had been investigated. The results illustrated that PE could be as 9-NAnt carrier to enter into zebrafish body, but significantly reduced the bioaccumulation of 9-NAnt, due to the occurrence of adsorption interactions between the simultaneous presence of both PE and 9-NAnt. After 4 days, the enzymes activity of cytochrome P4501A, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the abundance of malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid peroxide (LPO) responded strongly to low-dose PE exposure (10 mg/L). After 7 days exposure to PE-9-NAnt (40 mg/L), the P4501A activity increased significantly, but the activities of AChE and LDH were inhibited clearly, causing certain neurotoxicity and disorders of energy metabolism to zebrafish. The analysis of integrated biomarker response index (IBR) suggested that PE had greater bio-toxicity to zebrafish in all exposure groups after short-term exposure, but the PE-9-NAnt complex showed greater bio-toxicity after 7 days, which indicated that complex exposure of PE-9-NAnt had a delayed effect on the bio-toxicity of zebrafish. Furthermore, analysis of the intestinal microbiota exhibited that under the conditions of the exposure group with 9-NAnt, the relative abundance of the five dominant bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteriota, Bacteroidota and Verrucomicrobiota) changed greatly. Overall, this study confirmed that PE could carry 9-NAnt into fish causing bioaccumulation, but in the case of coexisting exposures, PE reduced 9-NAnt bioaccumulation, suggesting that microplastics with other emerging pollutants in chronic toxicity are probably next objects in future works. The bioaccumulation of 9-NAnt, strongly influenced by PE, caused limited bio-toxicity to zebrafish, but significantly changed the composition of intestinal microbiota. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",9-Nitroanthracene; Combined toxicity; Intestinal microbiota; Polyethylene; Zebrafish,"Aliphatic compounds; Bioaccumulation; Biomarkers; Enzymes; Metabolism; Microplastic; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Polyethylenes; Toxicity; Acetylcholinesterase; Adsorption interactions; Emerging pollutants; Integrated biomarker response; Lactate dehydrogenase; Organic contaminant; Short-term exposure; Superoxide dismutases; Organic pollutants; 9 nitroanthracene; acetylcholinesterase; anthracene; biological marker; catalase; cytochrome P450; cytochrome P4501A; environmental, industrial and domestic chemicals; lactate dehydrogenase; lipid peroxide; malonaldehyde; microplastic; polyethylene; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; 9-nitroanthracene; anthracene derivative; biological marker; plastic; polyethylene; adsorption; bioaccumulation; biomarker; chemical pollutant; cyprinid; cytochrome; experimental study; laboratory method; physiological response; toxicity; adsorption; adult; Article; Bacteroidota; bioaccumulation; chemical interaction; chronic toxicity; concentration (parameter); controlled study; energy metabolism; environmental exposure; enzyme activity; Firmicutes; Fusobacteriota; integrated biomarker response index; intestine flora; metabolic disorder; microplastic pollution; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; particle size; population abundance; Proteobacteria; Verrucomicrobiota; zebra fish; analysis; animal; metabolism; oxidative stress; toxicity; water pollutant; Bacteria (microorganisms); Danio rerio; Firmicutes; Microbiota; Proteobacteria; Animals; Anthracenes; Biomarkers; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Oxidative Stress; Plastics; Polyethylene; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish",Elsevier Ltd
Organic farming: Does it contribute to contaminant-free produce and ensure food safety?,"Ramakrishnan B., Maddela N.R., Venkateswarlu K., Megharaj M.",2021,Science of the Total Environment,"Organic farming for higher ecological and human health benefits has been adopted in about 186 countries, covering a total area of 71.5 Mha worldwide. Because of the associated practices, the flows of several environmental pollutants into the organic products threaten food safety and human health. The contaminants that occur at higher concentrations in organic produce include persistent organic pollutants (61.3–436.9 ng g−1 lamb meat, and 0.28 pg g−1-2.75 ng g−1 bovine meat), heavy metals (0.5–33.0 mg kg−1 lettuce), organochlorine pesticides (11–199 μg g−1 carrots), cyclodienes, hexachlorocyclohexanes, hexabromocyclododecane (2–3 times higher than in conventionally produced porcine meat), hexachlorobenzene (1.38–14.49 ng g−1 fat in milk), and non-brominated flame retardants (1.3–3.2 times higher than in conventional produce of greenhouse-grown tomato and cucumber). Moreover, some pollutants like per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances with a longer half-life (1.50–9.10 yrs) are reported to occur in several organic products. In fact, several legacy persistent organic pollutants are known for their significant trophic magnification in an urban terrestrial ecosystem. In addition, many plant functionalities are adversely affected in organic farming. Therefore, the long-term usage of organic products containing such pollutants poses a significant threat to human health. The major limitation in organic livestock production is the severe shortage of organic feed. Several variable standards and technical regulations set by the government and private agencies are the major obstacles in the global marketing of organic products. The present review critically addresses the impact of organic farming on hidden risks due to the use of composts as the amendment resources that enhance the phytoaccumulation and trophic transfer of pollutants, the functional diversity of the ecosystems, and poor harmonization among the policies and regulations in different countries for organic farming. The future directions of research have been suggested to mitigate unintended flows of pollutants into the organic products. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Biodiversity; Food safety; Human health risk; Organic farming; Pollutants,"Agriculture; Composting; Developing countries; Ecosystems; Flame retardants; Food safety; Health; Health risks; Heavy metals; Mammals; Meats; Brominated flame retardants; Environmental pollutants; Hexabromocyclododecanes; Organochlorine pesticides; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Terrestrial ecosystems; Trophic magnifications; Organic pollutants; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; chlortetracycline; ciprofloxacin; flame retardant; heavy metal; hexabromocyclododecane; hexachlorobenzene; hexachlorocyclohexane; organochlorine pesticide; oxytetracycline; paracetamol; surface water; tap water; tetracycline; theophylline; flame retardant; agricultural policy; bioaccumulation; biodiversity; concentration (composition); flame retardant; food safety; future prospect; health risk; organic farming; persistent organic pollutant; pollutant transport; terrestrial ecosystem; trophic structure; urban area; cattle manure; environmental policy; environmental sustainability; food safety; food shortage; greenhouse; human; lamb meat; livestock; nonhuman; organic farming; persistent organic pollutant; plant growth; priority journal; Review; sewage; soil property; swine manure; animal; bovine; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; food safety; organic farming; pig; Bovinae; Cucumis sativus; Daucus carota; Lactuca; Lycopersicon esculentum; Animals; Cattle; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Flame Retardants; Food Safety; Humans; Organic Agriculture; Swine",Elsevier B.V.
A taxonomy of vulnerable road users for hci based on a systematic literature review,"Hollander K., Colley M., Rukzio E., Butz A.",2021,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,"Recent automotive research often focuses on automated driving, including the interaction between automated vehicles (AVs) and so-called vulnerable road users (VRUs). While road safety statistics and trafc psychology at least defne VRUs as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists, many publications on human-vehicle interaction use the term without even defning it. The actual target group remains unclear. Since each group already poses a broad spectrum of research challenges, a one-fts-all solution seems unrealistic and inappropriate, and a much clearer diferentiation is required. To foster clarity and comprehensibility, we propose a literature-based taxonomy providing a structured separation of (vulnerable) road users, designed to particularly (but not exclusively) support research on the communication between VRUs and AVs. It consists of two conceptual hierarchies and will help practitioners and researchers by providing a uniform and comparable set of terms needed for the design, implementation, and description of HCI applications. © 2021 ACM.",Automated vehicles; Ehmis; External communication; Taxonomy; Vulnerable road users,Human engineering; Motor transportation; Pedestrian safety; Roads and streets; Taxonomies; All solutions; Automated driving; Automated vehicles; Broad spectrum; Conceptual hierarchy; Human vehicle interactions; Research challenges; Systematic literature review; Road vehicles,Association for Computing Machinery
Thermal Regeneration of Spent Granular Activated Carbon Presents an Opportunity to Break the Forever PFAS Cycle,"Sonmez Baghirzade B., Zhang Y., Reuther J.F., Saleh N.B., Venkatesan A.K., Apul O.G.",2021,Environmental Science and Technology,"Extensive use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has caused their ubiquitous presence in natural waters. One of the standard practices for PFAS removal from water is adsorption onto granular activated carbon (GAC); however, this approach generates a new waste stream, i.e., PFAS-laden GAC. Considering the recalcitrance of PFAS molecules in the environment, inadequate disposal (e.g., landfill or incineration) of PFAS-laden GAC may let PFAS back into the aquatic cycle. Therefore, developing approaches for PFAS-laden GAC management present unique opportunities to break its forever circulation within the aqueous environment. This comprehensive review evaluates the past two decades of research on conventional thermal regeneration of GAC and critically analyzes and summarizes the literature on regeneration of PFAS-laden GACs. Optimized thermal regeneration of PFAS-laden GACs may provide an opportunity to employ existing regeneration infrastructure to mineralize the adsorbed PFAS and recover the spent GAC. The specific objectives of this review are (i) to investigate the role of physicochemical properties of PFAS on thermal regeneration, (ii) to assess the changes in regeneration yield as well as GAC physical and chemical structure upon thermal regeneration, and (iii) to critically discuss regeneration parameters controlling the process. This literature review on the engineered regeneration process illustrates the significant promise of this approach that can break the endless environmental cycle of these forever chemicals, while preserving the desired physicochemical properties of the valuable GAC adsorbent. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Granular materials; Physicochemical properties; Waste incineration; Aqueous environment; Granular activated carbons; Literature reviews; Natural waters; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Regeneration process; Standard practices; Thermal regeneration; Activated carbon; activated carbon; adsorbent; charcoal; fluorocarbon; activated carbon; chemical compound; concentration (composition); detection method; temperature effect; Article; biodegradation; carbonization; chemical structure; conformation; critical micelle concentration; decomposition; heat treatment; high temperature; human; low temperature; mineralization; persistent organic pollutant; physical chemistry; pore size distribution; pyrolysis; regeneration; surface area; thermogravimetry; water cycle; water treatment; adsorption; water management; water pollutant; Adsorption; Charcoal; Fluorocarbons; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",American Chemical Society
Exposure to endocrine disruptors and risk of breast cancer: A systematic review,"Rocha P.R.S., Oliveira V.D., Vasques C.I., dos Reis P.E.D., Amato A.A.",2021,Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology,"Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between human exposure to endocrine disruptors (EDs) and the risk of breast cancer. Methods: This was a systematic review conducted by searching Cochrane Library, LILACS, Livivo, PubMed, and Science Direct. Observational studies addressing the association between exposure to EDs and breast cancer risk in adults were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment Translation tool. Results: a total of 37 studies were included. Most studies reported that exposure to organochlorine pesticides, phthalates, heavy metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was associated with increased breast cancer risk. Conclusion: qualitative analysis of observational studies indicates that human exposure to EDs is associated with increased breast cancer risk. Additional studies are needed to determine whether this association is causal. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Breast neoplasms; Endocrine disruptors; Endocrine system; Endocrine-disrupting chemicals; Environmental exposure; Toxicity,"1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethane; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; arsenic; cadmium; calcium; chlorphenotane; copper; dioxin; endocrine disruptor; heavy metal; hexabromocyclododecane; hexachlorobenzene; hexachlorocyclohexane; lead; mono (2 ethyl 5 carboxypentyl)phthalate; monobenzyl phthalate; monobutyl phthalate; organochlorine pesticide; pentachlorothioanisole; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkylated substance; perfluorooctane acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorosulfonated acid; phthalic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; unclassified drug; zinc; pesticide; breast cancer; cancer risk; data analysis; data extraction; endocrine system; environmental exposure; human; information processing; persistent organic pollutant; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; statistical bias; systematic review; adult; breast tumor; pollutant; Adult; Breast Neoplasms; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Pesticides",Elsevier Ireland Ltd
Microbiological Analysis of Two Deep Constructed Wetlands with Special Emphasis on the Removal of Pathogens and Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria,"Rampuria A., Gupta A.B., Kulshreshtha N.M., Brighu U.",2021,"Water, Air, and Soil Pollution","With the global concern on the role of wastewater treatment technologies in manifesting the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), it has now become imperative to analyze the emerging technologies for handling them. This study assesses the efficiency of two deep constructed wetlands (CWs) receiving partially treated sewage from a residential complex and a hospital designed for the removal of organics and pathogens. These systems were further analyzed for the presence of major ARB to identify the role of CWs in mitigating antibiotic resistance among microbial communities. The bacterial community responsible for metabolic conversions was analyzed by metagenomic sequencing. Finally, the efficiencies of deep CWs were analyzed for the removal of specific bacteria resistant to three antibiotics—piperacillin, colistin (polymixin E), and cefoperazone. The overall removal of extended spectrum beta lactamase producers and carbapenemase producers was also studied. Our results indicate that CWs offer decent BOD and COD removal efficiencies of 74.04–78.71% and 53.85–64.37% respectively. However, a zero-order reaction between loading rate and removal rate was obtained after loading rate of 170 g/m2.day indicating the organic loading capacity of the system. Metagenomic analysis revealed the presence of bacteria with diverse metabolic potentials for substrate conversion. Removal of fecal coliforms was high in the CWs, but the most interesting observation was the attenuation in ARB, which was found to be comparable to, or even better, than the reported values from conventional moving bed bioreactor. This observation may be attributed to the high retention times offered by CWs compared to that of conventional systems making them an attractive future alternative for treating domestic as well as hospital sewage for emerging pollutants. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB); Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE); Constructed wetland; Extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL); Pathogen,Antibiotics; Bacteria; Efficiency; Hospitals; Metabolism; Sewage; Wastewater treatment; Wetlands; Antibiotic resistance; Antibiotic-resistant bacteria; COD removal efficiency; Constructed wetlands (CWs); Emerging technologies; Microbial communities; Microbiological analysis; Wastewater treatment technologies; Loading; carbapenemase; cefoperazone; colistin; extended spectrum beta lactamase; piperacillin; antibiotic resistance; chemical pollutant; constructed wetland; fecal coliform; microbial community; microbiology; pathogen; Article; biochemical oxygen demand; chemical oxygen demand; chemical reaction; coliform bacterium; colony forming unit; constructed wetland; controlled study; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; Klebsiella oxytoca; Klebsiella pneumoniae; metagenomics; microbial community; nonhuman; sewage treatment; taxonomy; total coliform; waste water management; zero order reaction; Bacteria (microorganisms); Enterobacteriaceae,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
"Modern, exogenous exposures associated with altered mammary gland development: A systematic review","Kam R.L., Bernhardt S.M., Ingman W.V., Amir L.H.",2021,Early Human Development,"Background: Many women report low milk supply as the reason for premature breastfeeding cessation. Altered mammary gland development may impact a woman's lactation ability. Objective: This review identifies modern exogenous exposures which alter mammary gland development during embryonic life, puberty and pregnancy. Methods: A systematic review was undertaken whereby Medline, CINAHL and Embase articles published from January 1, 2005 to November 20, 2020 were searched using the keywords puberty or embry* or fetal or foetal or foetus or fetus or pregnan* or gestation* AND “mammary gland development” or “breast development” or “mammary development” or “mammary gland function” or “mammary function” or “insufficient glandular tissue” or “mammary hypoplasia” or “breast hypoplasia” or “mammary gland hypoplasia” or “tubular breast*” or “tuberous breast*” or “glandular tissue” or “breast composition” or “mammary composition” or “mammary gland composition”. After initial screening of 1207 records, 60 full texts were assessed for eligibility; 6 were excluded due to lack of information about exposure or outcome, leaving 54 studies. Results: The review included results from 52 animal (rats and mice, monkeys, rabbits, sheep, goats pigs and cows) and 2 human studies. Various endocrine disrupting chemicals and an obesogenic diet were found to be associated with altered mammary gland morphology during key development stages. Conclusions: To improve lactation outcomes, future studies need to focus on lactation as the endpoint and be conducted in a standardised manner to allow for a more significant contribution to the literature that allows for better comparison across studies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Breast; Development; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Lactation; Mammary gland; Obesity,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; endocrine disruptor; ethinylestradiol; perfluorooctanoic acid; endocrine disruptor; animal experiment; body weight; breast hypoplasia; breast tissue; case control study; case report; cell differentiation; clinical article; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; cow; cross-sectional study; embryo; gland tissue; goat; Haplorhini; histology; human; Leporidae; mammary gland; mammary gland function; mouse; nonhuman; obesogenic diet; observational study; pregnancy; puberty; Review; sheep; systematic review; animal; bovine; female; lactation; milk; pig; pregnancy; rat; sexual maturation; udder; Animals; Cattle; Endocrine Disruptors; Female; Lactation; Mammary Glands, Animal; Mice; Milk; Pregnancy; Rabbits; Rats; Sexual Maturation; Sheep; Swine",Elsevier Ireland Ltd
"Integrated analysis of physiological, transcriptomics and metabolomics provides insights into detoxication disruption of PFOA exposure in Mytilus edulis","Li F., Yu Y., Guo M., Lin Y., Jiang Y., Qu M., Sun X., Li Z., Zhai Y., Tan Z.",2021,Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a persistent environmental contaminant, resists environmental degradation and bioaccumulates in food chains. Lots of literatures have proved that PFOA exposure could disrupt detoxifying function in a variety of organisms, however, it still remained poorly known about this in mollusk. Here, we examined physiological, transcriptomic, and metabolomic responses to PFOA in Mytilus edulis, a model organism frequently used in studies of aquatic pollution. We aimed to characterize PFOA-induced stress responses and detoxification mechanisms. PFOA exposure significantly altered antioxidant enzyme activity levels and the abundances of lipid peroxidation products. In addition, transcriptomic analysis indicated that several genes associated with oxidative stress and detoxication were differentially expressed after PFOA exposure. In combination, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses showed that PFOA exposure disturbed several metabolic processes in M. edulis, including the lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism etc. Molecular examination and enzymes assay of PFOA-exposed M. edulis after a 7-day depuration period still did not recover to control levels. The Pathway enrichment analysis proved that several pathways related to detoxification, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) pathway etc, were obviously affected. The present work verifies firstly PFOA disruption to molluscan detoxification and identifies the key pathways to understand the molecular mechanisms thereof. This study provides new insights into the detoxication disruption invoked in response to PFOA exposure in M. edulis. © 2021",Detoxification; Mytilus edulis; Omics analysis; Oxidative stress; Perfluorooctanoic acid,amino acid; carbohydrate; lipid; mitogen activated protein kinase; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; stress activated protein kinase; antioxidant; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; transcriptome; bioaccumulation; bioassay; detoxification; enzyme activity; metabolism; molecular analysis; mollusc; organic acid; oxidative stress; pollution exposure; amino acid metabolism; animal experiment; animal tissue; antioxidant activity; Article; carbohydrate metabolism; controlled study; detoxification; environmental exposure; enzyme activity; gene expression; genetic association; lipid metabolism; lipid peroxidation; metabolomics; Mytilus edulis; nonhuman; oxidative stress; physiological stress; physiology; transcriptomics; water pollution; animal; metabolism; metabolomics; Mollusca; Mytilus edulis; Animals; Antioxidants; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Lipid Metabolism; Metabolomics; Mytilus edulis; Oxidative Stress; PPAR gamma; Transcriptome,Academic Press
"Erratum: Water and health seminar and special issue highlight ideas that will change the field (International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health (2020) 226, (S1438463920303618), (10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113529))","Holcomb D., Palli L., Setty K., Uprety S.",2021,International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health,"The 11th international “Water & Health” seminar took place from June 24–26, 2019 in Cannes, France. The seminar is sponsored annually by Suez, a 150-year-old multinational water and waste management company, to support research into water quality and health carried out by advanced doctoral students. It promotes ongoing communication among students, established scientists, and industry practitioners from all over the world. The seminar aims to: enhance dialogue between junior scientists and senior mentors, spotlight early-breaking research concepts and results, cross disciplinary boundaries to contribute to the advancement of water safety, and identify new critical research needs. This special issue contains a number of articles on challenges such as emerging pollutants and antimicrobial resistance, as well as both high-tech and nature-based solutions. Some key topics from the seminar and this special issue include advancing data modeling to consider heterogeneity of populations, recognizing synergies among environmental health interventions, optimizing health by building resiliency through measured risk exposure, and understanding the role of contextual factors in tailoring intervention strategies to a given population or setting. The winning seminar presentation came from Tanguy Pouzol, who modeled the release of 15 pharmaceuticals in effluents from a semi-urban area of 16,000 inhabitants and a 450-bed hospital. Pharmaceuticals have been detected in all types of water bodies worldwide and have been the subject of numerous risk assessments since the 1970s, as described in several recent comprehensive reviews (Ebele et al., 2017; Kümmerer, 2016; Li, 2014; Palli et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2017). Gosset et al. (2020) report a comparison of ecotoxicological risk assessment approaches for a “cocktail” of chemical pollutants, including pharmaceutical residues, discharged by urban wastewater treatment plants near Lyon, France. Their findings demonstrate the importance of jointly considering all the components of a pollutant mixture for accurate assessment of environmental risks. However, measuring concentrations of pharmaceutical residues in water remains a complex task. Analytical techniques under development that may improve environmental detection of pharmaceuticals include DNA nanobiosensors, which are reviewed by Soukarié et al. (2020) in this special issue. DNA nanobiosensors present a promising approach for an array of water quality monitoring applications, including the detection of microorganisms, as described by one of the review co-authors, Diana Soukarié, in a seminar presentation on her ongoing research. The ongoing challenge of environmental measurement also highlights the need for complementary approaches to characterize pharmaceutical concentrations in environmental waters, such as simulation modeling. The model proposed by Dr. Pouzol (Pouzol et al., 2020) was based on the monthly sales recorded in 6 pharmacies and the daily consumption of the hospital, over 2.5 years, with hypotheses on the frequency of consumption, metabolism and release in wastewaters. For most molecules, the modeled concentrations matched well with the concentrations observed during several monitoring campaigns. The model allowed prediction of wastewater flows and changes in concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the effluents, on an hourly time scale, and thus prediction of important concentration peaks that cannot be observed by random or integrated sampling. Compared to classical approaches, such a model improved the average performance by one-third while giving additional information. Future improvements and perspectives should focus on improving knowledge on pharmaceutical loads, especially their variability at both daily and hourly scales, including in-sewer processes and improving the usability of the model by simplifying it while keeping its stochastic nature. The recent Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Synthesis Report on Water and Sanitation emphasized that the world is not on track to achieve global SDG 6 targets by 2030 and highlighted the need for improved understanding of the baseline status and trends of global indicators to support renewed progress (UN Water, 2018). The seminar and special issue addressed the challenges and interactions among development goals that must be considered to achieve sustainable water and sanitation for all. A microbial source tracking (MST) study conducted by Dr. David Holcomb in Mozambican households found widespread human fecal contamination, highlighting the obstacles to improving sanitary conditions through simple interventions directed at households (Holcomb et al., 2020). A study characterizing human fecal pollution of Thai surface waters using host-associated bacteriophages identified opportunities to reduce diarrheal disease risks at a broader scale through improved coastal water quality management (Chyerochana et al., 2020). These and other recent evaluation studies reflect a growing awareness of the synergies among water and health risks and other development interventions. For instance, efforts to mitigate environmental transmission of fecal pathogens must address sustainable management of fecal wastes throughout the sanitation chain. The decentralized sanitation infrastructure common in rapidly growing urban areas in particular requires effective solutions for fecal sludge removal and treatment. An intervention impact study in Maputo, Mozambique demonstrated how subsidized pour-flush sanitation systems can increase hygienic emptying of fecal sludge, but also highlighted that the use of such services was unaffordable for many users (Capone et al., 2020). Dr. Paul Hunter presented a discussion on how our ongoing knowledge of threats posed by waterborne noroviruses is shifting to account for population variability and the factors that influence susceptibility. Along the same lines, Sital Uprety demonstrated geographic variation in diarrheal disease risk in rural Nepal through a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) informed by a cross-sectional evaluation of household drinking water quality in the aftermath of the 2015 earthquake disaster (Uprety et al., 2020). While Uprety et al. used the fecal indicator bacterium (FIB) Escherichia coli to characterize risk under a reference pathogen approach, the seminar featured a discussion of the limitations of QMRA for predicting pathogen-specific risks. Specifically, QMRA has been found to overestimate disease burdens for pathogens such as norovirus, for which there remains substantial uncertainty around both the dose-response relationships and the implications of population immunity (Van Abel et al., 2017). The growing issue of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) organisms compounds the risks posed by enteric infections. In addition to selection pressure driving an increase in AMR organisms in clinical settings, the presentation and article by Voigt et al. (2020) presented evidence for the introduction of antibiotic residues, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) to environmental waters downstream of wastewater treatment facilities. Such risks are not confined to surface water, as demonstrated in an article by Salazar et al. (2020), which found aerosolized ARB in proximity of a river passing through La Paz, Bolivia, where urban population densities imply an elevated risk of exposure. A seminar presentation by Dr. Karen Setty discussed intervention design, specifically the evidence base to address contextual variability in Water Safety Plan implementation and scale-up (Setty et al., 2019; Setty, 2019). Water safety plans represent a risk management approach developed by the World Health Organization to support safe drinking water provision (Bartram et al., 2009). These plans can be adapted to different resource settings from a community to industrial scale, and have the potential to enhance equitable outcomes (Ross et al., 2019). Dr. Setty borrowed concepts from the emerging field of implementation science to understand and better explain why results of complex interventions often vary among locations. Recognizing these site-specific contextual constraints or “barriers” and matching them to active, proven strategies can help to extend water, sanitation, and hygiene services to all under SDG 6 (United Nations, 2015). Articles in this issue recognize the outstanding needs of underserved populations such as the Roma in Europe (Anthonj et al., 2020), sustainable pit latrine emptying practices in low-income settings such as Mozambique (Capone et al., 2020), and affordable drinking water treatment using local materials such as curry leaf (Mukherjee et al., 2020). Contextual clues also offer a bridge to potential “quality improvement” solutions through rapid experimental cycling of pilots, data collection, and adjusted approaches (Setty et al., 2019; Setty, 2019). Finally, a short communication by Dr. Mark LeChevallier bridges the ideas and challenges raised in the 2019 seminar with other global phenomena underlying access to safe water (namely, climate change). Dr. LeChevallier illustrates how climate shifts are already impacting water and health by heightening risks and requiring innovative adaptation of existing systems (LeChevallier, 2020). Climate adaptation will draw increased attention as the central theme of a future Water and Health seminar. © 2021",,erratum,Elsevier GmbH
Environmental toxicants in the brain: A review of astrocytic metabolic dysfunction,"McCann M.S., Maguire-Zeiss K.A.",2021,Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology,"Exposure to environmental toxicants is linked to long-term adverse outcomes in the brain and involves the dysfunction of glial and neuronal cells. Astrocytes, the most numerous cell type, are increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases of the central nervous system, including neurodegenerative diseases. Astrocytes are critical for proper brain function in part due to their robust antioxidant and unique metabolic capabilities. Additionally, astrocytes are positioned both at the blood-brain barrier, where they are the primary responders to xenobiotic penetrance of the CNS, and at synapses where they are in close contact with neurons and synaptic machinery. While exposure to several classes of environmental toxicants, including chlorinated and fluorinated compounds, and trace metals, have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, their impact on astrocytes represents an important and growing field of research. Here, we review existing literature focused on the impact of a range of synthetic compounds on astrocytic function. We focus specifically on perturbed metabolic processes in response to these compounds and consider how perturbation of these pathways impacts disease pathogenesis. © 2021 The Author(s)",Dioxin; Glia; Glucose; Glutathione; Manganese; Metabolism; Neurodegeneration; Organochlorines; Polychlorinated biphenyls,ammonia; antioxidant; glucose; glutathione; glycogen; manganese; organochlorine derivative; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perperfluoro alkyl; trace metal; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; xenobiotic agent; antioxidant activity; astrocyte; brain dysfunction; brain metabolism; cell function; cell metabolism; environmental exposure; human; metabolic disorder; nerve degeneration; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; pathogenesis; perivascular cell; pollutant; Review; synaptic transmission; animal; brain; drug effect; metabolism; pollutant; toxicity; Animals; Astrocytes; Brain; Environmental Pollutants; Humans,Elsevier B.V.
Efficient photochemical vapor generation of bismuth using a coiled Teflon reactor: Effect of metal sensitizers and analytical performance with flame-in-gas-shield atomizer and atomic fluorescence spectrometry,"Vyhnanovský J., Yildiz D., Štádlerová B., Musil S.",2021,Microchemical Journal,"Photochemical vapor generation (PVG) of bismuth was accomplished in a simple flow–injection system with a standard Hg low-pressure tube lamp and a coiled Teflon reactor. The influence of a reaction medium flow rate (irradiation time) and composition was investigated using a miniature diffusion flame atomizer and high-resolution continuum source atomic absorption spectrometry. Combination of 40% (v/v) acetic acid, 1.25% (v/v) formic acid and a metal sensitizer at a flow rate of 3 mL min−1 (irradiation time of 90 s) was found optimal. The use of various metals as sensitizers was studied to initiate and enhance PVG substantially. The evident positive effect was found for four metal cations and the enhancement effect was in the following order: Cu2+ &lt; Cd2+ &lt; Fe2+ ≪ Co2+. At 50 mg L−1 Co2+ as the sensitizer, the overall PVG efficiency of 54 ± 2% was determined from relative comparison of sensitivities obtained with PVG and liquid nebulization coupled simultaneously to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In order to reach low limits of detection (LOD) at low operation cost, a coupling of PVG to atomic fluorescence spectrometry was tested and conditions of atomization in two flame atomizers were optimized. A blank-limited LOD of 12 ng L−1 was obtained with an advanced flame-in-gas-shield atomizer, which competes with PVG coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (5 ng L−1). Interferences from commonly used inorganic acids (HNO3, HCl and H2SO4) and other elements (As3+, Pb2+, Sb3+, Se4+ and Te4+) were also investigated and the accuracy was verified by analysis of water Standard Reference Material NIST 1643f. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Atomic absorption spectrometry; Atomic fluorescence spectrometry; Bismuth; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Photochemical vapor generation,,Elsevier Inc.
"Climate change and industrial F-gases: A critical and systematic review of developments, sociotechnical systems and policy options for reducing synthetic greenhouse gas emissions","Sovacool B.K., Griffiths S., Kim J., Bazilian M.",2021,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,"Humanity has come to depend on synthetic, factory made gases that have extremely significant global warming potential. Fluorinated greenhouse gases, or F-gases, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) have been termed “super pollutants” and “super greenhouse gases” given their severe and powerful impact on the climate. They are the most potent greenhouse gases known to modern science, with global warming potentials far greater than carbon dioxide, some up to almost 24,000 times more so. Troublingly, they are also the fastest growing class of greenhouse gas emissions around the world, especially in developing countries. Research suggest that almost 40% of their emissions by 2050 will fall outside the scope of international agreements such as the Paris Accord, Montreal Protocol and Kigali Amendment. Without comprehensive and sustained interventions, uncontrolled growth in F-gas emissions could offset all of the gains made by the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, or the cornerstone of existing international climate governance, the Nationally Determined Contributions of the 2015 Paris Accord. This review asks: What options are available to mitigate the environmental impacts of F-gases and thus make their manufacturing or disposal far more sustainable? What technical solutions and innovations exist to make their industrial usage low to zero carbon? What benefits will accrue from F-gas mitigation, and what barriers will need addressed? It undertakes a comprehensive and critical review of more than 140,000 sources of evidence, and a short list of 855 studies on the topic. It utilizes a sociotechnical lens that examines the manufacturing and use of F-gases across multiple sectors (including refrigeration, electronics manufacturing, non-ferrous metals processing, and applications in consumer goods) and components of its lifecycle (including not only manufacturing, but also use, disposal and destruction). We find that there are several policies and regulations that can be employed to address this already serious and growing climate change challenge. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Anthropogenic emissions; Climate change; Climate mitigation; Fluorinated greenhouse gases; Fluorocarbons; Fugitive emissions; HFC-23; High-global warming potential emissions; Industrial decarbonization; NF3; Perfluorocarbons; PFCs; SF6; Short lived climate pollutant; Synthetic greenhouse gas; Trace emissions,Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Developing countries; Electronics industry; Emission control; Fluorocarbons; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Inclusions; International cooperation; Manufacture; Sulfur hexafluoride; Clean Development Mechanism; Electronics manufacturing; Global warming potential; Hydrofluorocarbons; Montreal Protocols; Nitrogen trifluoride; Sociotechnical systems; Technical solutions; Gas emissions,Elsevier Ltd
"Caffeine removal from aqueous media by adsorption: An overview of adsorbents evolution and the kinetic, equilibrium and thermodynamic studies","Bachmann S.A.L., Calvete T., Féris L.A.",2021,Science of the Total Environment,"Caffeine is an emerging pollutant and is considered the most representative pollutant of the Pharmaceutical Active due to its high consumption by the general population. It can be used to track pollution caused by humans. Different technologies have been employed to remove the caffeine from aqueous media, however the adsorption has been preferred due to its simplicity, high removal efficiency, operational and implementation facility and low cost. This paper provides a systematic review of the published peer-reviewed literature concerned with caffeine removal by the adsorption process. The Scopus and ScienceDirect databases were used to identify relevant articles researches on caffeine removal. Many authors have studied caffeine's adsorption equilibrium in aqueous media, different conditions, and different adsorbents. This paper aims to uncover the overall trend of adsorbent used, kinetic and thermodynamic studies. The impact of pH, temperature, adsorbent dosage and competitive effect were presented and analyzed. It was observed that the adsorption capacities ranged between 10 and 1000 mg g−1, according to the nature and properties of the adsorbent. The pseudo-second order (kinetic model) and the Langmuir isotherm model showed the best adjustment of the experimental data from caffeine adsorption in most studies. The mechanistic understanding of adsorption and the development of new adsorbents are still a matter of future research, as well as the use of other kinetic models based on statistical factors and the thermodynamic studies should be considered. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Adsorption; Aqueous media; Caffeine; Isotherm; Kinetic model; Thermodynamic studies,Adsorption isotherms; Caffeine; Kinetic parameters; Kinetic theory; Pollution; Thermodynamic properties; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption equilibria; Competitive effects; Kinetic and thermodynamic studies; Langmuir isotherm models; Pseudo second order; Removal efficiencies; Thermodynamic studies; Adsorption; activated carbon; adsorbent; attapulgite; bentonite; biochar; caffeine; carbon; carbon nanofiber; carbon nanotube; charcoal; clinoptilolite; graphene; polymer; resin; silicate; unclassified drug; xerogel; zeolite; adsorption; aqueous solution; pollutant removal; reaction kinetics; thermodynamics; adsorption; adsorption equilibrium; aqueous solution; coconut; concentration (parameter); contact time; Elaeis guineensis; environmental temperature; evolution; grape; hydrophobicity; isotherm; kinetics; nonhuman; pH; pineapple; pistachio; plant leaf; priority journal; rapeseed; Review; sediment; thermodynamics; waste component removal; Scopus,Elsevier B.V.
Male reproductive toxicity of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA): Rodent studies,"Wang Z., Zhang T., Wu J., Wei X., Xu A., Wang S., Wang Z.",2021,Chemosphere,"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is an artificial organic substance widely used for decades, which seriously threatens human health. This study aimed to identify human-relevant correlates between PFOA exposure and the male rodent reproductive system. We performed a systematic literature review of the relevant literature of PubMed, Cochrane Library databases, Web of Science and Embase from the establishment to April 2020. Studies included the effects of PFOA on the reproductive system of male rodents. The meta-analysis was performed on the basis of the following points: level of testosterone and estradiol in serum, development of reproductive organs, pathological changes of reproduction organs and parameters of semen. A series of 16 studies was enrolled in this study. The standard mean difference (SMD) for PFOA-related reproductive toxicity was summarised as −0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71, −0.07). The lower serum testosterone levels, decreased absolute testicular and epididymal weights, higher serum estradiol levels, elevated relative testicular and seminal vesicle weights and increased incidence of Leydig cell adenoma and percentage of abnormal sperm were observed in the exposed group compared with the control group. However, no statistical difference was found in the day of preputial separation of pups and percentage of motile sperm. In conclusion, PFOA exposure heightens the reproductive system damage in male rodents. However, many studies included in the review did not identify mechanisms by which PFOA induces changes to the male reproductive system, which is an area for additional study. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Male reproductive system; Meta-analysis; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Reproduction toxicity; Rodent,Cell proliferation; Mammals; Confidence interval; Pathological changes; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Reproductive organs; Reproductive systems; Reproductive toxicities; Statistical differences; Systematic literature review; Toxicity; estradiol; perfluorooctanoic acid; testosterone; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; bioaccumulation; cell; ecophysiology; organic pollutant; pathology; pollution effect; pollution exposure; rodent; testosterone; drug exposure; estradiol blood level; incidence; male genital system; nonhuman; reproductive toxicity; seminal plasma; seminal vesicle; testosterone blood level; animal; male; meta analysis; reproduction; rodent; Rodentia; Animals; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Male; Reproduction; Rodentia,Elsevier Ltd
Meta-Analysis on the associations between Prenatal Perfluoroalkyl Substances Exposure and Adverse Birth Outcomes,"Li F., Zhong Z., Xu C., Zhang B., Aamir M., Shen C., Liu S., Yin S.",2021,Journal of Donghua University (English Edition),"The epidemiological associations between the prenatal perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exposure and the reproductive outcomes remain controversial. A continuous evaluation is needed to combine the inconsistent results. In this study, we explored the associations between PFASs exposure and the low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth and small for gestational age (SGA). The quality of selected literature, quantitative estimates, publication bias and subgroup analysis were performed on the basis of 17 retrieved articles published before December 2020. The results showed a significant positive association between the perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure and the risk of LBW[Odds ratio (OR)=1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.36; heterogeneity: P=0.30, I2=17%]. The positive association was also observed between the PFOS and the risk of preterm birth (OR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.39, P=0.007; I2=62%). There was a paucity of evidence regarding the negative effects of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) on the pregnancy outcomes. The findings from the subgroup analysis (the sampling period, the birth gender and biologic specimens) did not substantially altered the results of the overall pooled estimate ORs. The increased prevalence of negative birth outcomes with gestational PFASs exposure warrants further explorations from biological process perspective.

Antibiotics in wastewater: From its occurrence to the biological removal by environmentally conscious technologies,"Langbehn R.K., Michels C., Soares H.M.",2021,Environmental Pollution,"In this critical review, we explored the most recent advances about the fate of antibiotics on biological wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Although the occurrence of these pollutants in wastewater and natural streams has been investigated previously, some recent publications still expose the need to improve the detection strategies and the lack of information about their transformation products. The role of the antibiotic properties and the process operating conditions were also analyzed. The pieces of evidence in the literature associate several molecular properties to the antibiotic removal pathway, like hydrophobicity, chemical structure, and electrostatic interactions. Nonetheless, the influence of operating conditions is still unclear, and solid retention time stands out as a key factor. Additionally, the efficiencies and pathways of antibiotic removals on conventional (activated sludge, membrane bioreactor, anaerobic digestion, and nitrogen removal) and emerging bioprocesses (bioelectrochemical systems, fungi, and enzymes) were assessed, and our concern about potential research gaps was raised. The combination of different bioprocess can efficiently mitigate the impacts generated by these pollutants. Thus, to plan and design a process to remove and mineralize antibiotics from wastewater, all aspects must be addressed, the pollutant and process characteristics and how it is the best way to operate it to reduce the impact of antibiotics in the environment. © 2021 Elsevier LtdThis review approaches the main aspects that influence antibiotic degradation by bioprocesses and assess how those processes affect their removal. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Biodegradation; Emerging pollutants; Metabolite; Mineralization; Process parameter,"Anaerobic digestion; Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Nitrogen removal; Pollution; Sewage treatment plants; Sludge digestion; Wastewater treatment; Antibiotic degradation; Bio-electrochemical systems; Biological wastewater treatment plant; Molecular properties; Potential researches; Process characteristics; Solid retention time; Transformation products; Antibiotics; antibiotic agent; antifungal agent; nitrogen; antiinfective agent; activated sludge; antibiotics; biodegradation; bioreactor; detection method; environmental fate; membrane; metabolite; mineralization; pollution monitoring; wastewater; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; water quality; activated sludge; anaerobic digestion; antifungal therapy; biodegradation; chemical structure; electrochemical analysis; human; hydrophobicity; nonhuman; physical chemistry; protein processing; publication; Review; solids retention time; static electricity; waste water treatment plant; water pollutant; sewage; wastewater; water management; water pollutant; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Elsevier Ltd
In Situ X-ray Diffraction Investigation of the Crystallisation of Perfluorinated CeIV-Based Metal–Organic Frameworks with UiO-66 and MIL-140 Architectures**,"Shearan S.J.I., Jacobsen J., Costantino F., D'Amato R., Novikov D., Stock N., Andreoli E., Taddei M.",2021,Chemistry - A European Journal,"We report on the results of an in situ synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction study of the crystallisation in aqueous medium of two recently discovered perfluorinated CeIV-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), analogues of the already well investigated ZrIV-based UiO-66 and MIL-140A, namely, F4_UiO-66(Ce) and F4_MIL-140A(Ce). The two MOFs were originally obtained in pure form in similar conditions, using ammonium cerium nitrate and tetrafluoroterephthalic acid as reagents, and small variations of the reaction parameters were found to yield mixed phases. Here, we investigate the crystallisation of these compounds, varying parameters such as temperature, amount of the protonation modulator nitric acid and amount of the coordination modulator acetic acid. When only HNO3 is present in the reaction environment, only F4_MIL-140A(Ce) is obtained. Heating preferentially accelerates nucleation, which becomes rate determining below 57 °C. Upon addition of AcOH to the system, alongside HNO3, mixed-phased products are obtained. F4_UiO-66(Ce) is always formed faster, and no interconversion between the two phases occurs. In the case of F4_UiO-66(Ce), crystal growth is always the rate-determining step. A higher amount of HNO3 favours the formation of F4_MIL-140A(Ce), whereas increasing the amount of AcOH favours the formation of F4_UiO-66(Ce). Based on the in situ results, a new optimised route to achieving a pure, high-quality F4_MIL-140A(Ce) phase in mild conditions (60 °C, 1 h) is also identified. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH",cerium; crystallization; in situ X-ray diffraction; kinetics; metal–organic frameworks,Chemical reactions; Crystallization; Nitric acid; Nitrogen compounds; X ray diffraction; Zirconium metallography; Aqueous medium; In-situ synchrotrons; In-situ X-ray diffraction; Interconversions; Rate determining step; Reaction parameters; Small variations; Varying parameters; Cerium compounds,John Wiley and Sons Inc
Investigating molecular mechanisms of immunotoxicity and the utility of toxcast for immunotoxicity screening of chemicals added to food,"Naidenko O.V., Andrews D.Q., Temkin A.M., Stoiber T., Uche U.I., Evans S., Perrone-Gray S.",2021,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"The development of high-throughput screening methodologies may decrease the need for laboratory animals for toxicity testing. Here, we investigate the potential of assessing immunotoxicity with high-throughput screening data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ToxCast program. As case studies, we analyzed the most common chemicals added to food as well as per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) shown to migrate to food from packaging materials or processing equipment. The antioxidant preservative tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) showed activity both in ToxCast assays and in classical immunological assays, suggesting that it may affect the immune response in people. From the PFAS group, we identified eight substances that can migrate from food contact materials and have ToxCast data. In epidemiological and toxicological studies, PFAS suppress the immune system and decrease the response to vaccination. However, most PFAS show weak or no activity in immune-related ToxCast assays. This lack of concordance between toxicological and high-throughput data for common PFAS indicates the current limitations of in vitro screening for analyzing immunotoxicity. High-throughput in vitro assays show promise for providing mechanistic data relevant for immune risk assessment. In contrast, the lack of immune-specific activity in the existing high-throughput assays cannot validate the safety of a chemical for the immune system. © 2021 by the authors.

Prevalence threshold of screening tests in obstetrics and gynecology,"Elfassy L., Lasry A., Gil Y., Balayla J.",2021,European Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Reproductive Biology,"Objective: We define the prevalence threshold as the prevalence level below which a test's positive predictive value (PPV) declines most sharply relative to disease prevalence – and thus the rate of false positive results/false discovery rate increases most rapidly. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence threshold of various screening tests used in obstetrics and gynecology among low-risk women in modern clinical practice. Methods: We searched Medline, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane database, and PubMed to obtain the sensitivity and specificity estimates for the following screening tests: 50 g-oral glucose tolerance test (GDM-50 g), non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), combined first trimester screening (FTS), vagino-rectal swab for group B streptococcus (GBS) in pregnancy, cervical cytology (Pap) and HPV testing, mammography and manual breast exam, urinary PCR and cervical-vaginal swab testing for gonorrhoea and chlamydia as well as AMH for the diagnosis of PCOS. We used these estimates to calculate disease-specific prevalence thresholds, comparing them to the actual estimates of disease prevalence. Results: The prevalence thresholds and average estimates of disease prevalence (shown in brackets) are as follows: GDM-50 g 31 % (6%), NIPT 7% (0.2 %), combined FTS 19.5 % (0.2 %), GBS swab 18 % (15–45 %), Pap 21 % (0.2 %), HPV 27 % (0.2 %), mammography 25 % (12.5 %), breast exam 25 % (12.5 %), gonorrhoea -chlamydia 6–13 % (4.2–4.7 %), AMH for PCOS 32 % (10 %). Conclusion: The prevalence thresholds of various screening tests used in obstetrics and gynecology are well above the estimated disease prevalence. This implies that when undertaking population-level screening a significant proportion of positive screening tests obtained are likely false-positives. Attempts at individualizing pre-test probability when undertaking population-level screening are needed in order to best interpret the results of screening tests. © 2021",Bayes’ theorem; Prevalence; Prevalence threshold; Screening,Muellerian inhibiting factor; aneuploidy; Article; bacterial colonization; breast cancer; breast examination; Chlamydia; clinical practice; Cochrane Library; diagnostic test accuracy study; Embase; false positive result; female; first trimester pregnancy; gonorrhea; gynecology; human; Human papillomavirus test; mammography; Medline; noninvasive prenatal testing; nucleic acid amplification; obstetrics; oral glucose tolerance test; ovary polycystic disease; Papanicolaou test; papillomavirus infection; polymerase chain reaction; predictive value; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnancy test; prevalence; priority journal; Scopus; screening test; sensitivity and specificity; Streptococcus agalactiae; systematic review; trisomy 21; uterine cervix cancer; uterine cervix cytology; vagina smear; Web of Science; mass screening; pregnancy; prevalence; Female; Gynecology; Humans; Mass Screening; Obstetrics; Pregnancy; Prevalence; Sensitivity and Specificity; Vaginal Smears,Elsevier Ireland Ltd
Environmental exposures and the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease: The potential role of BACE1 as a critical neurotoxic target,"Syeda T., Cannon J.R.",2021,Journal of Biochemical and Molecular Toxicology,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health crisis due to devastating cognitive symptoms, a lack of curative treatments, and increasing prevalence. Most cases are sporadic (>95% of cases) after the age of 65 years, implicating an important role of environmental factors in disease pathogenesis. Environmental neurotoxicants have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's Disease and AD. Animal models of AD and in vitro studies have shed light on potential neuropathological mechanisms, yet the biochemical and molecular underpinnings of AD-relevant environmental neurotoxicity remain poorly understood. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a potentially critical pathogenic target of environmentally induced neurotoxicity. BACE1 clearly has a critical role in AD pathophysiology: It is required for amyloid beta production and expression and activity of BACE1 are increased in the AD brain. Though the literature on BACE1 in response to environmental insults is limited, current studies, along with extensive AD neurobiology literature suggest that BACE1 deserves attention as an important neurotoxic target. Here, we critically review research on environmental neurotoxicants such as metals, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, polyfluoroalkyl substances, heterocyclic aromatic amines, advanced glycation end products, and acrolein that modulate BACE1 and potential mechanisms of action. Though more research is needed to clearly understand whether BACE1 is a critical mediator of AD-relevant neurotoxicity, available reports provide convincing evidence that BACE1 is altered by environmental risk factors associated with AD pathology, implying that BACE1 inhibition and its use as a biomarker should be considered in AD management and research. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",Alzheimer's disease; BACE1; environmental neurotoxicants; oxidative stress,"acrolein; advanced glycation end product; alkyl group; amyloid beta protein; aromatic amine; beta secretase 1; fungicide; herbicide; metal derivative; pesticide; aspartic proteinase; BACE1 protein, human; neurotoxin; secretase; aging; Alzheimer disease; environmental exposure; enzyme activity; human; in vitro study; mild cognitive impairment; neurobiology; neuropathology; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; protein expression; protein function; protein protein interaction; Review; risk factor; upregulation; adverse event; aged; animal; biosynthesis; brain; disease model; environmental exposure; enzymology; female; gene expression regulation; male; pathology; toxicity and intoxication; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Animals; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Environmental Exposure; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Humans; Male; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Neurotoxins",John Wiley and Sons Inc
Perfluorinated polymer modified vertical silicon nanowires as ultra low noise laser desorption ionization substrate for salivary metabolites profiling,"Jiang X., Chen X., Wang T., Li Y., Pan A., Wu J.",2021,Talanta,"Metabolites in the body fluid are becoming a rich source of disease biomarkers. Developing an effective and high throughput detection and analysis platform of metabolites is of great importance for potential biomarker discovery and validation. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) has been successfully applied in rapid biomolecules detection in large scale. However, non-negligible background interference in low molecule-weight region still constitutes a main challenge even though various nanomaterials have been developed as an alternative to traditional organic matrix. In this work, a novel composite chip, silicon nanowires loaded with fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP@SiNWs) was fabricated. It can serve as an excellent substrate for nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS) detection with ultra-low background noise in low molecular weight region (<500 Da). Ion desorption efficiency and internal energy transfer of FEP@SiNWs were studied using benzylpyridinium salt and tetraphenylboron salt as thermometer chemicals. The results indicated that a non-thermal desorption mechanism might be involved in the LDI process on FEP@SiNWs. Owing to the higher LDI efficiency and low background interference of this novel substrate, the metabolic fingerprint of complex bio-fluids, such as human saliva, can be sensitively and stably acquired. As a proof of concept, FEP@SiNWs chip was successfully used in the detection of salivary metabolites. With the assistance of multivariate analysis, 22 metabolic candidates (p < 0.05) which can discriminate type 2 diabetes mellitus (2-DM) and healthy volunteers were found and identified. The role of these feature metabolites in the metabolic pathway involved in 2-DM was confirmed by literature mining. This work demonstrates that FEP@SiNWs-based NIMS might be served as an efficient and high throughput platform for metabolic biomarker exploration and clinical diagnosis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Disease diagnosis; Low background noise; Metabolomics; Nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry; Saliva detection,"Biomarkers; Biomolecules; Body fluids; Desorption; Diagnosis; Energy transfer; Ethylene; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Multivariant analysis; Nanowires; Silicon; Substrates; Fluorinated ethylene propylene; High-throughput detection; Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry; Metabolic fingerprints; Multi variate analysis; Perfluorinated polymers; Type 2 diabetes mellitus; Ultra low backgrounds; Metabolites; nanowire; polymer; silicon; human; laser; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Lasers; Nanowires; Polymers; Silicon; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization",Elsevier B.V.

In vivo and in vitro studies, case reports, review articles, cadaveric studies, biomechanical studies, histological studies, oncological studies, technical notes, studies dealing with radiological classifications and studies on revision surgery were excluded. Results: A total of 5 studies involving 301 patients were included. Patients had a mean age of 84.6 years and were followed up for a mean period of 11 months. The proximal femoral fractures were stabilized with implantation of the PFNA or Gamma nail and augmentation was performed with two different cements: polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in 4 studies and calcium phosphate (CP) in one study. Overall, 57.5% of patients reached the same or greater preoperative mobility, and postoperative Parker Mobility Score and Harris Hip Score were acceptable. No significantly complications were observed, and no additional surgery related to the implant was required. Conclusion: The results of this systematic review show that cement augmentation is a safe and effectiveness method of fixation to treat trochanteric fractures. © 2020 Delhi Orthopedic Association",Cement augmentation; Cut-out risk; Femur fracture; Osteoporosis; Screw mobilization,,Elsevier B.V.
Fragile-to-strong transitions in glass forming liquids,Lucas P.,2021,Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,"Since they were first reported almost two decades ago, fragile-to-strong (FTS) transitions have been observed in all categories of glass-forming systems including metallic, covalent, ionic and molecular liquids. In these systems, a transition from Arrhenius to non-Arrhenius viscosity behavior is observed in conjunction with anomalies in multiple thermodynamic variables including the heat capacity, the thermal expansion coefficient and the isothermal compressibility. A review of experimental evidences supporting the existence of FTS transitions is presented. In particular FTS transitions are found to be concomitant with a peak in heat-capacity as well as density extrema associated with a negative expansion coefficient in the region of the transition. Moreover, spectroscopic analyses also show distinct structural changes across these liquid-liquid transitions. Reports of FTS transitions in each category of liquid are reviewed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,Expansion; Glass; Specific heat; Spectroscopic analysis; Thermal expansion; Expansion coefficients; Experimental evidence; Glass-forming liquid; Glass-forming systems; Isothermal compressibility; Liquid-liquid transition; Thermal expansion coefficients; Thermodynamic variables; Liquids,Elsevier B.V.
Mixtures of persistent organic pollutants increase ovarian granulosa tumor cell line migration and spheroid invasion by upregulating MMP2 expression and activity via IGF1R,"Gogola-Mruk J., Hoffmann-Młodzianowska M., Kamińska K., Ptak A.",2021,Toxicology,"Granulosa cell tumors (GCT) of the ovary have a good prognosis. Recurrence tends to be late; however, > 66 % of patients with recurrent GCT die from the disease. Most recurrences are abdominopelvic, although distant metastases have been documented. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a mixture of persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) stimulates the invasion of GCT cells. We selected perfluorooctanoate (PFOA, 2 ng/mL), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS, 8 ng/mL), 2,2-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p’-DDE, 1 ng/mL), polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (PCB153, 100 pg/mL), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB, 50 pg/mL), which have the highest measured concentrations in follicular fluid of women undergoing treatment with assisted reproductive technology. The human GCT cell lines COV434 and KGN have been used as in vitro models of juvenile (JGCT) and adult (AGCT) GCT subtypes, respectively. Cells were treated with a mixture of the test compounds for 15 min prior to analysis of protein phosphorylation; for 4 h prior to analysis in a circular chemorepellent-induced defect assay; for 6 h prior to analysis of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) activity; for 24 h prior to analysis of migration, invasion, and gene expression; and for 48 h prior to analysis of protein expression. First, we showed that KGN cells migrated and exhibited invasive behavior. By contrast, COV434 cells lacked migration and invasion potential. Moreover, expression of mesenchymal genes and the gene encoding MMP2 was higher in KGN cells, and that of epithelial genes lower, than that in COV434 cells. Treatment of KGN cells with the EDC mixture stimulated cell migration, invasion, and lymphatic dissemination. The results suggest that the role of the EDC mixture in AGCT invasion is not related to changes in expression of epithelial and mesenchymal genes; rather, it is related to increased expression and activity of MMP2. Additionally, silencing insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1R) in AGCT abolished the stimulatory effect of the EDC mixture on KGN spheroid invasion. These results demonstrate that the EDC mixture increased KGN spheroid invasion by stimulating expression and activity of MMP2 via IGF1R. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Granulosa cell tumor spheroid; Insulin-like growth factor 1; Metalloproteinase 2; Migration; Persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals; Spheroid invasion,"chemorepellent; claudin 1; claudin 3; claudin 4; endocrine disruptor; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; hexachlorobenzene; nerve cell adhesion molecule; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; small interfering RNA; somatomedin C; transcription factor ZEB1; uvomorulin; vimentin; gelatinase A; IGF1R protein, human; MMP2 protein, human; somatomedin C receptor; adult; Article; autophosphorylation; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; female; GCT cell line; gene expression; gene silencing; granulosa cell tumor; human; human cell; in vitro study; infertility therapy; KGN cell line; ovary follicle fluid; persistent organic pollutant; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; real time polymerase chain reaction; upregulation; Western blotting; wound healing assay; biosynthesis; cell culture technique; cell motion; dose response; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; granulosa cell tumor; metabolism; multicellular spheroid; ovary tumor; pathology; physiology; toxicity; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Granulosa Cell Tumor; Humans; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Ovarian Neoplasms; Persistent Organic Pollutants; Receptor, IGF Type 1; Spheroids, Cellular; Up-Regulation",Elsevier Ireland Ltd
The Role of Inflammation and Infection in Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases: Lessons From Bacterial Meningitis Applied to Alzheimer Disease and Age-Related Macular Degeneration,"Too L.K., Hunt N., Simunovic M.P.",2021,Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience,"Age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), are multifactorial and have diverse genetic and environmental risk factors. Despite the complex nature of the diseases, there is long-standing, and growing, evidence linking microbial infection to the development of AD dementia, which we summarize in this article. Also, we highlight emerging research findings that support a role for parainfection in the pathophysiology of AMD, a disease of the neurosensory retina that has been shown to share risk factors and pathological features with AD. Acute neurological infections, such as Bacterial Meningitis (BM), trigger inflammatory events that permanently change how the brain functions, leading to lasting cognitive impairment. Neuroinflammation likewise is a known pathological event that occurs in the early stages of chronic age-related neurodegenerative diseases AD and AMD and might be triggered as a parainfectious event. To date, at least 16 microbial pathogens have been linked to the development of AD; on the other hand, investigation of a microbe-AMD relationship is in its infancy. This mini-review article provides a synthesis of existing evidence indicating a contribution of parainfection in the aetiology of AD and of emerging findings that support a similar process in AMD. Subsequently, it describes the major immunopathological mechanisms that are common to BM and AD/AMD. Together, this evidence leads to our proposal that both AD and AMD may have an infectious aetiology that operates through a dysregulated inflammatory response, leading to deleterious outcomes. Last, it draws fresh insights from the existing literature about potential therapeutic options for BM that might alleviate neurological disruption associated with infections, and which could, by extension, be explored in the context of AD and AMD. © Copyright © 2021 Too, Hunt and Simunovic.",age-related macular degeneration; Alzheimer disease; bacterial meningitis; infection; neurodegenerative disease; neuroinflammation,alternative complement pathway C3 C5 convertase; amyloid beta protein; apolipoprotein E; C reactive protein; chemokine; complement; complement component C3; complement component C3b receptor; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement factor H; complement factor I; cytokine; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; membrane cofactor protein; nucleotide binding oligomerization domain like receptor; presenilin 1; presenilin 2; toll like receptor; toll like receptor 2; tumor necrosis factor; vasculotropin inhibitor; age related macular degeneration; Alzheimer disease; bacterial meningitis; Candida albicans; central nervous system infection; Chlamydia pneumoniae; cryptococcal meningitis; cytokine storm; Cytomegalovirus; dementia; Epstein Barr virus; genetic linkage; genetic polymorphism; Helicobacter pylori; Hepatitis C virus; heredity; homeostasis; human; Human alphaherpesvirus 1; Human herpesvirus 6; Human immunodeficiency virus; immune dysregulation; immune response; immunosenescence; infection; lead poisoning; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Neisseria meningitidis; nervous system inflammation; oxidative stress; parainfection; Review; risk factor; systematic review; Toxoplasma gondii; traumatic brain injury; Varicella zoster virus,Frontiers Media S.A.
A review on contaminants of emerging concern in European raptors (2002−2020),"González-Rubio S., Ballesteros-Gómez A., Asimakopoulos A.G., Jaspers V.L.B.",2021,Science of the Total Environment,"Raptors (birds of prey and owls) have been widely used as suitable bioindicators of environmental pollution. They occupy the highest trophic positions in their food chains and are documented to bioaccumulate high concentrations of persistent pollutants such as toxic metals and legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs).Whereas raptors played a critical role in developing awareness of and policy for chemical pollution, they have thus far played a much smaller role in current research on contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Given the critical knowledge obtained from monitoring ‘legacy contaminants’ in raptors, more information on the levels and effects of CECs on raptors is urgently needed. This study critically reviews studies on raptors from Europe reporting the occurrence of CECs with focus on the investigated species, the sampled matrices, and the bioanalytical methods applied. Based on this, we aimed to identify future needs for monitoring CECs in Europe. Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), novel flame retardants (NFRs), and to a lesser extent UV-filters, neonicotinoids, chlorinated paraffins, parabens and bisphenols have been reported in European raptors. White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), Peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) were the most frequently studied raptor species. Among matrices, eggs, feathers and plasma were the most widely employed, although the potential role of the preen gland as an excretory organ for CECs has recently been proposed. This review highlights the following research priorities for pollution research on raptors in Europe: 1) studies covering all the main classes of CECs; 2) research in other European regions (mainly East Europe); 3) identification of the most suitable matrices and species for the analysis of different CECs; and 4) the application of alternative sample treatment strategies (e.g. QuEChERS or pressurized liquid extraction) is still limited and conventional solvent-extraction is the preferred choice. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Birds of prey; Bisphenols; Emerging organic contaminants; Neonicotinoids; Novel flame retardants; Perfluoroalkyl substances,"Birds; Flame retardants; Solvent extraction; Bioanalytical methods; Chlorinated paraffins; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Environmental pollutions; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Persistent organic pollutants; Pressurized liquid extraction; Research priorities; Organic pollutants; 1,2 bis(2,4,6 tribromophenoxy)ethane; 2 ethylhexyl 2,3,4,5 tetrabromobenzoic acid; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzoic acid; benzyl paraben; bis(2 ethylhexyl) 3,4,5,6 tetrabromo phthalic acid; bisphenol AF; bisphenol F; bisphenol S; bisphenol Z; butyl paraben; decabromodiphenyl ethane; dechlorane; dechlorane plus; flame retardant; long carbon chain paraffin; medium carbon chain paraffin; organofluorine derivative; paraffin; pentylparaben; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; phenol derivative; phenylparaben; phthalic acid; propyl paraben; short carbon chain paraffin; unclassified drug; flame retardant; chemical pollutant; concentration (composition); extraction method; flame retardant; persistent organic pollutant; plasma; raptor; solvent; Accipiter gentilis; Belgium; bioaccumulation; blood; body fat; concentration (parameter); egg; Falco peregrinus; falcon; feather; food availability; Haliaeetus albicilla; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liver; nonhuman; Norway; peer review; persistent organic pollutant; priority journal; pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry; raptor; Review; sediment; solvent extraction; Spain; Sweden; toxicity testing; trend study; trophic level; animal; environmental monitoring; Europe; pollutant; Europe; Accipiter gentilis; Falco peregrinus; Haliaeetus albicilla; Raptores; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Europe; Flame Retardants; Raptors",Elsevier B.V.
Comparison of clinical outcomes with hip replacement versus PFNA in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly: A systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA),"Chen J., Yue C., He P., Huang Z., Li L., Zhang X., Fan Y., Liu Y.",2021,Medicine,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of HR and PFNA in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly. METHODS: We carried out this review according to the principle of preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline. The clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies (RCSs), and case-control studies involving HR and PFNA in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly from 2000 to 2020 were compared by searching Web of Science, Pubmed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase. The quality of the included cohort study (CS) lines was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The quality of the included RCT lines was evaluated using Jadad. Forest plots were drawn by RevMan5.4 software based on the results and the data were analyzed. RESULTS: After screening, a total of 9 articles were included, of which one was a clinical RCT and eight were RCSs with 1374 patients. The operative time of the PFNA group was shorter [WMD = 15.20; 95% CI (13.17, 17.23), P < .05] and the intraoperative blood loss was less [WMD = 178.81; 95% CI (97.24, 260.38), P < .05] than the HR group, while the first weight-bearing time of the HR group was shorter [WMD = -7.70; 95% CI (-10.54, -4.86), P  < .05] than the PFNA group. There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay, HHS, postoperative orthopedic complications, and postoperative medical complications between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: With the development of HR technology and minimally invasive technology, the trauma caused by surgery is decreasing. Under the premise of improving perioperative management, such as optimizing the preoperative preparation and postoperative management, shortening the operative time, reducing intraoperative blood loss, and actively managing co-existing diseases, HR has more advantages than PFNA in the treatment of senile intertrochanteric fractures.

Adverse outcome pathway in immunotoxicity of perfluoroalkyls,"Neagu M., Constantin C., Bardi G., Duraes L.",2021,Current Opinion in Toxicology,"Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a broad class of synthetic compounds produced since the 1940s that are found in environment and in most consumer products, including food and drinking water. PFAS induce several toxicological effects, as the epidemiological studies have revealed immunotoxicity and neurotoxicity effects included. Although epidemiological studies have shown that the long-term exposure would affect various organisms and human health, the intimate molecular mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. Appropriate adverse outcome pathways can be used in the future to develop mechanistic assays to predict adverse effects upon human's exposure to PFAS and bring new information on interspecies circulation of these ubiquitous compounds. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Adverse outcome pathway; Immunotoxicity; Neurotoxicity; Perfluoroalkyls,aliphatic compound; aryldialkylphosphatase 1; cytokine; gamma interferon; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin G; interleukin 10; interleukin 13; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; interleukin 6; mitogen activated protein kinase; n methyl dextro aspartic acid; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; regulatory associated protein of mTOR; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; adverse outcome pathway; bioaccumulation; C57BL 6 mouse; cell function; coronavirus disease 2019; diphtheria; eczema; epidemiological data; genotoxicity; Haemophilus influenzae type b; helper cell; homeostasis; immunopathology; immunotoxicity; lipid homeostasis; long term exposure; lymphocyte; malignant neoplasm; measles; metabolic disorder; mouse; neuroblastoma; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; pharmacokinetics; plasma; respiratory tract infection; Review; systematic review; tetanus; Th1 Th2 balance; vaccination,Elsevier B.V.
"Beyond bulk δ15N: Combining a suite of stable isotopic measures improves the resolution of the food webs mediating contaminant signals across space, time and communities","Elliott K.H., Braune B.M., Elliott J.E.",2021,Environment International,"Top predators are used as indicators of contaminant trends across space and time. However, signals are integrated over complex food webs, and variation in diet may confound such signals. Trophic position, assessed by bulk δ15N, is widely used to infer the variation in diet relevant to contamination, yet a single variable cannot completely describe complex food webs. Thus, we examined relationships across three aquatic systems varying from a single species to a small food web using bulk values from four isotopes and 21 amino acid-specific values. Because variation in baseline ('source') δ15N can confound estimates of trophic position, we calculated trophic position from the difference between δ15Ntrophic (δ15N for amino acids that change with trophic position) and δ15Nsource (δ15N for amino acids that do not change with trophic position). Across all three systems, variation in δ15Nsource explained over half of the variation in bulk δ15N, and stable isotope values that reflected the base of the food web (δ13C, δ18O, δ34S) predicted contaminants as well or better than δ15N—which was supported by a meta-analysis of other studies. In ospreys feeding in lakes, variation in δ15Nsource across space created a spurious relationship between ΣDDT and apparent trophic position, and masked a relationship between ΣPCB and trophic position. In a seabird guild, changes in diet over time obscured temporal variation in contaminants over five decades. In Arctic fish and invertebrates, more accurate trophic magnification factors were calculated using δ15Ntrophic-source. Thus, (1) using δ15Ntrophic-source, instead of bulk δ15N, avoided incorrect conclusions and improved accuracy of trophic magnification factors necessary to assess risk to top predators; and (2) diet assessed with multiple spatial isotopes, rather than δ15N alone, was essential to understand patterns in contaminants across space, time and biological communities. Trophic position was most important for lipophilic ‘legacy’ contaminants (ΣDDT, ΣPCB) and habitat was most important for other contaminants (ΣPBDE, ΣPFAS, mercury). We argue that the use of amino acid-specific analysis of δ15N alongside ‘non-trophic’ isotopes should be a core feature of any study that examines the influence of trophic position on chemical pollution, as required for a chemical to be added to international conventions such as the Stockholm Convention. © 2020 The Authors",Compound-specific stable isotope analysis; environmental monitoring and processes; fate of contaminants in ecosystems; food webs; indicator species,Amino acids; Chemical analysis; Ecology; Isotopes; Risk assessment; Biological community; Chemical pollution; International conventions; Single variable; Stable isotopes; Temporal variation; Trophic magnifications; Trophic position; Contamination; alanine; aspartic acid; chemical compound; glutamic acid; glycine; isoleucine; leucine; lysine; mercury; methionine; nitrogen 15; per and polyfluoroalkyl substance; phenylalanine; polybrominated diphenyl ether; proline; serine; threonine; unclassified drug; valine; mercury; nitrogen; aquatic ecosystem; bioindicator; chemical pollutant; environmental fate; environmental monitoring; fish; food web; invertebrate; isotopic analysis; predator; stable isotope; adult; animal tissue; Article; community; controlled study; diet; environmental monitoring; fish; food web; habitat; indicator organism; invertebrate; isotope analysis; lake; measurement accuracy; nonhuman; Pandion haliaetus; pollution; priority journal; space; time; trophic level; volume; animal; Arctic; food chain; meta analysis; Indicator indicator; Invertebrata; Pandion; Animals; Arctic Regions; Food Chain; Invertebrates; Mercury; Nitrogen Isotopes,Elsevier Ltd
Endocrine disrupting chemicals: Impacts on human fertility and fecundity during the peri-conception period,"Green M.P., Harvey A.J., Finger B.J., Tarulli G.A.",2021,Environmental Research,"It is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid exposure to man-made endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and environmental toxicants. This escalating yet constant exposure is postulated to partially explain the concurrent decline in human fertility that has occurred over the last 50 years. Controversy however remains as to whether associations exist, with conflicting findings commonly reported for all major EDC classes. The primary aim of this extensive work was to identify and review strong peer-reviewed evidence regarding the effects of environmentally-relevant EDC concentrations on adult male and female fertility during the critical periconception period on reproductive hormone concentrations, gamete and embryo characteristics, as well as the time to pregnancy in the general population. Secondly, to ascertain whether individuals or couples diagnosed as sub-fertile exhibit higher EDC or toxicant concentrations. Lastly, to highlight where little or no data exists that prevents strong associations being identified. From the greater than 1480 known EDCs, substantial evidence supports a negative association between exposure to phthalates, PCBs, PBDEs, pyrethroids, organochloride pesticides and male fertility and fecundity. Only moderate evidence exists for a negative association between BPA, PCBs, organochloride pesticides and female fertility and fecundity. Overall fewer studies were reported in women than men, with knowledge gaps generally evident for both sexes for all the major EDC classes, as well as a paucity of female fertility studies following exposure to parabens, triclosans, dioxins, PFAS, organophosphates and pyrethroids. Generally, sub-fertile individuals or couples exhibit higher EDC concentrations, endorsing a positive association between EDC exposure and sub-fertility. This review also discusses confounding and limiting factors that hamper our understanding of EDC exposures on fertility and fecundity. Finally, it highlights future research areas, as well as government, industry and social awareness strategies required to mitigate the negative effects of EDC and environmental toxicant exposure on human fertility and fecundity. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Infertility; IVF; Periconception; Reproduction; Toxicant,"1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; alkyl group; dioxin; endocrine disruptor; herbicide; hormone; insecticide; organochlorine derivative; organophosphate; perfluoroalkanoic acid; pesticide; phytoestrogen; polybrominated biphenyl; polychlorinated biphenyl; pyrethroid; triclosan; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; adult; DNA determination; embryo; environmental exposure; female; female fertility; gamete; hormonal regulation; human; human cell; implantation; male; male fertility; oocyte; persistent organic pollutant; pregnancy rate; priority journal; Review; sperm quality; spermatogenesis; spermatozoon motility; subfertility; time to pregnancy; adverse event; fertility; pollutant; pregnancy; toxicity; Adult; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fertility; Humans; Male; Parabens; Pregnancy",Academic Press Inc.
"PFAS and cancer, a scoping review of the epidemiologic evidence","Steenland K., Winquist A.",2021,Environmental Research,"Background: The number of studies addressing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and cancer is increasing. Many communities have had water contaminated by PFAS, and cancer is one of the important community concerns related to PFAS exposure. Objectives: We critically reviewed the evidence relating to PFAS and cancer from an epidemiologic standpoint to highlight directions for future research that would be the most likely to meaningfully increase knowledge. Methods: We conducted a search in PubMed for studies of cancer and PFAS (through 9/20/2020). We identified epidemiologic studies that provided a quantitative estimate for some measure of the association between PFAS and cancer. Here, we review that literature, including several aspects of epidemiologic study design that impact the usefulness of study results. Results: We identified 16 cohort (or case-cohort) studies, 10 case-control studies (4 nested within cohorts and 6 non-nested), 1 cross sectional study and 1 ecologic study. The cancer sites with the most evidence of an association with PFAS are testicular and kidney cancer. There are also some suggestions in a few studies of an association with prostate cancer, but the data are inconsistent. Discussion: Each study's design has strengths and limitations. Weaknesses in study design and methods can, in some cases, lead to questionable associations, but in other cases can make it more difficult to detect true associations, if they are present. Overall, the evidence for an association between cancer and PFAS remains sparse. A variety of studies with different strengths and weaknesses can be helpful to clarify associations between PFAS and cancer. Long term follow-up of large-sized cohorts with large exposure contrasts are most likely to be informative. © 2021",Cancer; PFAS; PFOA; PFOS; Review,perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; water; adult; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer localization; case control study; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; human; kidney cancer; male; malignant neoplasm; Medline; priority journal; prostate cancer; quantitative analysis; Review; systematic review; testis cancer; kidney tumor; pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Water,Academic Press Inc.
Transition of aromatic volatile and transcriptome profiles during melon fruit ripening,"Nagashima Y., He K., Singh J., Metrani R., Crosby K.M., Jifon J., Jayaprakasha G.K., Patil B., Qian X., Koiwa H.",2021,Plant Science,"Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is an important diploid crop with a wide variety of flavors due to its distinct aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOC). To understand the development of VOC profiles during fruit development, we performed metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis of two cantaloupe varieties over the course of fruit development. A total of 130 metabolites were detected in fruit samples, and 449014207 reads were mapped to the melon genome. A total of 4469 differentially expressed genes in fruits were identified and used to visualize the transition of VOC and transcriptomic profiles during the fruit development. A shift of VOC profiles in both varieties was observed from early-fruit profiles enriched in C5-C8 lipid-derived VOCs to late-fruit profiles abundant in C9 lipid-derived VOCs, apocarotenoids, and esters. The shift coincided with the expression of specific isoforms of lipid and carotenoid metabolizing enzymes as well as transcription factors involved in fruit ripening, metabolite regulation, and hormone signaling. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Apocarotenoids; Aromatic volatiles; Carotenoids; Cucumis melo; Lipids; RNA-seq,"amino acid; carotenoid; plant RNA; transcriptome; volatile organic compound; Cucurbitaceae; fruit; genetics; growth, development and aging; high performance liquid chromatography; mass fragmentography; metabolism; multigene family; polymerase chain reaction; sequence alignment; Amino Acids; Carotenoids; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Cucurbitaceae; Fruit; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Multigene Family; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Plant; Sequence Alignment; Transcriptome; Volatile Organic Compounds",Elsevier Ireland Ltd
Porous monolithic materials for extraction and preconcentration of pollutants from environmental waters,"Masini J.C., do Nascimento F.H., Vitek R.",2021,Trends in Environmental Analytical Chemistry,"This review presents the strengths and weaknesses of monolithic materials for the enrichment of inorganic and organic contaminants in environmental waters. We describe the most common materials (silica, organic, and hybrid organic silica) and strategies for constructing monoliths in different moulds and shapes (tubes, cartridges, stir bars, fibers) published since 2015. The functionalization of the pore surfaces enhances their affinity towards different classes of pollutants. For instance, the incorporation of chelating groups enables the enrichment of potentially toxic metals and semi-metals in aquatic environments before the analyses by spectrometric techniques. Monolithic materials for extracting emerging pollutants, diverse classes of herbicides, and fungicides were proposed recently. Incorporation of carbon-based and magnetic nanoparticles, metal-organic frameworks, and ionic liquids enhanced their adsorption capacity by either increasing the surface area or providing multiple retention mechanisms. Monoliths with molecular recognition properties for highly selective extractions have been synthesized, including boronic functionalities and molecularly imprinted cavities. The final part describes the hybrid organic silica monoliths, emphasizing metal ions and speciation analysis hyphenated with ICP-MS. In the outlook section, we point to some fields we believe monoliths will benefit, such as their 3-D technologies preparation. We also pointed their potential applicability in portable chromatographic systems, restricted access materials, and enhanced use to preconcentrate viruses from aquatic environments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Chromatography; Emerging pollutants; Environmental monitoring; Hormones; Nanomaterials; Pesticides; Pharmaceuticals; Potentially toxic metals; Sample preparation; Solid-phase extraction,,Elsevier B.V.
A Critical Review of a Recommended Analytical and Classification Approach for Organic Fluorinated Compounds with an Emphasis on Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances,"Fiedler H., Kennedy T., Henry B.J.",2021,Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management,"Organic fluorinated compounds have been detected in various environmental media and biota. Some of these compounds are regulated locally (e.g., perfluorononanoic acid maximum contaminant level in drinking water by the New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection), nationally (e.g., perfluorooctanoic acid maximum acceptable concentration in drinking water by Health Canada), or internationally (e.g., Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants). Globally, regulators and researchers seek to identify the organic fluorinated compounds associated with potential adverse effects, bioaccumulation, mobility, and persistence to manage their risks, and, to understand the beneficial attributes they bring to products such as first responder gear, etc. Clarity is needed to determine the best analytical method for the goal of the analyses (e.g., pure research or analysis to determine the extent of an accidental release, monitoring groundwater for specific compounds to determine regulatory compliance, and establish baseline levels in a river of organic fluorinated substances associated with human health risk prior to a clean-up effort). Analytical techniques that identify organic fluorine coupled together with targeted chemical analysis will yield information sufficient to identify public health or environmental hazards.

Algae-induced photodegradation of antibiotics: A review,"Wei L., Li H., Lu J.",2021,Environmental Pollution,"Antibiotics are a typical group of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) with emerging pollutant effects. The presence of residual antibiotics in the environment is a prominent issue owing to their potential hazards, toxic effects, and persistence. Several treatments have been carried out in aquatic environments in order to eliminate antibiotic residues. Among these, photodegradation is regarded as an environmentally-friendly and efficient option. Indirect photodegradation is the main pathway for the degradation of residual antibiotics in natural water, as opposed to direct photodegradation. Algae, working as photosensitizers, play an important role in the indirect photolysis of residual antibiotics in natural water bodies. They promote this reaction by secreting extracellular organic matters (EOMs) and inducing the generation of active species. In order to provide a thorough understanding of the effects of algae on residual antibiotic degradation in the environment, this paper comprehensively reviews the latest research regarding algae-induced antibiotic photodegradation. The summary of the different pathways and photosensitive mechanisms involved in this process show that EOMs are indispensable to antibiotic photodegradation. The influencing factors of algae-induced photodegradation are also discussed here: these include algae species, antibiotic types, and environmental variables such as light source, ferric ion presence, temperature, and ultrasound treatment. Based on the review of existing literature, this paper also considers several pathways for the future study of algae-induced antibiotic photodegradation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Algae; Antibiotics; Extracellular organic matters; Photodegradation; Photosensitizers,"Algae; Light sources; Photodegradation; Photolysis; Photosensitizers; Water treatment; Antibiotic degradation; Antibiotic photodegradation; Direct photodegradation; Environmental variables; Extracellular organic matters; Natural water bodies; Pharmaceutical and personal care products; Ultrasound treatments; Antibiotics; antibiotic agent; cefradine; cephalosporin; chlortetracycline; ciprofloxacin; enrofloxacin; extracellular organic matter; ferric ion; gatifloxacin; nordifloxacin; norfloxacin; organic matter; photosensitizing agent; antiinfective agent; iron; water; algal bloom; antibiotics; drug; environmental degradation; literature review; organic matter; photodegradation; PPCP; alga; Chlorella vulgaris; concentration (parameter); environmental temperature; green chemistry; humic substance; light; microalga; Microcystis aeruginosa; molecular weight; nonhuman; pH; photodegradation; photolysis; Scenedesmus; Scenedesmus meyen; surface property; ultrasound; waste component removal; water pollutant; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Iron; Photolysis; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier Ltd
Early-life perfluorooctanoic acid exposure induces obesity in male offspring and the intervention role of chlorogenic acid,"Shao W., Xu J., Xu C., Weng Z., Liu Q., Zhang X., Liang J., Li W., Zhang Y., Jiang Z., Gu A.",2021,Environmental Pollution,"Chlorogenic acid (CGA) ameliorates gestational PFOA exposure induced obesity and metabolic disorder in male oﬀspring. © 2020 Elsevier LtdPerfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is an emerging organic pollutant (EOP) hazardous to human health. Effects of maternal PFOA exposure on offspring as well as the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, ICR mouse models of gestational low PFOA exposure (0.05 mg/kg/day) were established to investigate the roles on metabolic disorders of offspring. Body weight, body composition, hepatic lipid levels, transcriptome and metabolome were analyzed. Expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, inflammasome formation and gut barrier integrity were measured. Furthermore, oral administration of chlorogenic acid (CGA) (100 mg/kg/day) was performed to observe the rescue effect on lipid disorders caused by PFOA exposure. Our findings demonstrated that gestational exposure to PFOA resulted in obesity, hepatic inflammation, disorders of lipid metabolism, and disruption of gut barrier integrity in male offspring. Notably, these adverse effects were attenuated by CGA supplementation. These data suggested that PFOA exposure during early life stage induced potential risks for later onset of obesity and metabolic disorder which could be ameliorated by CGA treatment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Chlorogenic acid; Gestational exposure; Metabolic disorder; Obesity; Perfluorooctanoic acid,"Biochemistry; Nutrition; Organic pollutants; Adverse effect; Body composition; Chlorogenic acids; Lipid metabolisms; Metabolic disorders; Oral administration; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Potential risks; Metabolism; acylcarnitine; alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; CD14 antigen; chlorogenic acid; claudin 1; claudin 5; connexin 43; cryopyrin; diacylglycerol; fatty acid binding protein 2; fatty acid binding protein 3; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A lyase; inflammasome; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; monoacylglycerol; perfluorooctanoic acid; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylglycerol; phosphatidylserine; phosphorylcholine; sphingomyelin; toll like receptor 4; triacylglycerol; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; male; metabolism; obesity; organic pollutant; organofluorine; pregnancy; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alkaline phosphatase blood level; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; body composition; body weight; controlled study; disorders of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism; energy metabolism; enteritis; Fabp1 gene; Fabp2 gene; Fabp3 gene; gene; gene expression; hepatitis; intestine mucosa permeability; lipid liver level; lipid metabolism; male; metabolomics; mouse; mouse model; nonhuman; obesity; progeny; RNA sequencing; supplementation; transcriptomics; animal; female; human; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; liver; obesity; Animals; Caprylates; Chlorogenic Acid; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Obesity",Elsevier Ltd
Recent US State and Federal Drinking Water Guidelines for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances,Post G.B.,2021,Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a class of synthetic chemicals produced for over 70 years, are of increasing concern because of their widespread environmental presence, extreme persistence, bioaccumulative nature, and evidence for health effects from environmentally relevant exposures. In 2016, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) established nonregulatory drinking water Health Advisories of 70 ng/L for individual and total concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), the 8-carbon perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) that are the most thoroughly studied PFAS. As of May 2020, 9 US states had concluded that the USEPA Health Advisories are insufficiently protective and developed more stringent PFOA and PFOS guidelines. In addition, 10 states had developed guidelines for other PFAS, primarily PFAAs. This Critical Review discusses the scientific basis for state and USEPA drinking water guidelines for PFOA and PFOS; the same principles apply to guidelines for other PFAS. Similarities and differences among guidelines arise from both toxicity and exposure considerations. The approximately 4-fold range among state guidelines (8–35 ng/L for PFOA, 10–40 ng/L for PFOS) is not large or unexpected for guidelines developed by different scientists at different time points, especially when compared with older USEPA and state guidelines that were generally several orders of magnitude higher. Additional state guidelines for PFOA, PFOS, and other PFAS are expected to become available.

A critical review of modeling Poly- and Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in the soil-water environment,"Sima M.W., Jaffé P.R.",2021,Science of the Total Environment,"Due to their health effects and the recalcitrant nature of their C[sbnd]F bonds, Poly- and Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) are widely investigated for their distribution, remediation, and toxicology in ecosystems. However, very few studies have focused on modeling PFAS in the soil-water environment. In this review, we summarized the recent development in PFAS modeling for various chemical, physical, and biological processes, including sorption, volatilization, degradation, bioaccumulation, and transport. PFAS sorption is kinetic in nature with sorption equilibrium commonly quantified by either a linear, the Freundlich, or the Langmuir isotherms. Volatilization of PFAS depends on carbon chain length and ionization status and has been simulated by a two-layer diffusion process across the air water interface. First-order kinetics is commonly used for physical, chemical, and biological degradation processes. Uptake by plants and other biota can be passive and/or active. As surfactants, PFAS have a tendency to be sorbed or concentrated on air-water or non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL)-water interfaces, where the same three isotherms for soil sorption are adopted. PFAS transport in the soil-water environment is simulated by solving the convection-dispersion equation (CDE) that is coupled to PFAS sorption, phase transfer, as well as physical, chemical, and biological transformations. As the physicochemical properties and concentration vary greatly among the potentially thousands of PFAS species in the environment, systematic efforts are needed to identify models and model parameters to simulate their fate, transport, and response to remediation techniques. Since many process formulations are empirical in nature, mechanistic approaches are needed to further the understanding of PFAS-soil-water-plant interactions so that the model parameters are less site dependent and more predictive in simulating PFAS remediation efficiency. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Interface; PFAS; Plants; Soil; Sorption; Transport,Air; Biochemistry; Degradation; Ionization of liquids; Isotherms; Physicochemical properties; Remediation; Soil moisture; Solute transport; Sorption; Air water interfaces; Biological degradation; Biological transformation; Convection-dispersion equations; First order kinetics; Nonaqueous phase liquids; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Remediation efficiency; Phase interfaces; carbon; organofluorine derivative; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; surfactant; unclassified drug; water; critical analysis; diffusion; hydrological modeling; reaction kinetics; soil remediation; soil water; soil-vegetation interaction; sorption; transport process; volatilization; air; bioaccumulation; bioremediation; biotransformation; concentration (parameter); degradation; desorption; diffusion; dispersion; ionization; isotherm; Michaelis Menten kinetics; physical chemistry; priority journal; Review; simulation; soil; thermodynamics; volatilization,Elsevier B.V.
Persistent organic pollutants and couple fecundability: a systematic review,"Kahn L.G., Harley K.G., Siegel E.L., Zhu Y., Factor-Litvak P., Porucznik C.A., Klein-Fedyshin M., Hipwell A.E., program collaborators for Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes Program",2021,Human reproduction update,"BACKGROUND: Despite increasing regulation, exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) remains a serious public health concern due to their accumulation in the environment and ability to biomagnify up the food chain. POPs are associated with endocrine-disrupting effects including adverse reproductive outcomes that could affect fecundability, i.e. the capacity to conceive a pregnancy, quantified as time to pregnancy (TTP). OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Results of epidemiologic studies that examine the impact of various chemical classes of POPs on TTP have not been synthesised. We undertook a systematic review to summarise the strength of evidence for associations of four common groups of POPs with couple fecundability and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature in order to inform policy decisions and future research. SEARCH METHODS: We performed an electronic search of literature published between 1 January 2007 and 6 August 2019 in MEDLINE, EMBASE.com, Global Health, DART/TOXLINE and POPLINE. We included empirical research papers that examined human exposure to organochlorine (OC) pesticides, brominated flame retardants, polychlorinated organic compounds and/or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and considered TTP or fecundability as an outcome. Standardised forms for screening, data extraction and study quality were developed using DistillerSR software, and all reviews were completed in duplicate. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias and devised additional quality metrics based on specific methodological features of fecundability studies. OUTCOMES: The search returned 4573 articles, and 28 papers from 19 different studies met inclusion criteria. Among them, four studies measured TTP prospectively, three had data on participants' prenatal exposure, three examined associations in both male and female partners and one focused exclusively on males. Analyses varied widely in terms of exposure characterisation, precluding a meta-analytic approach. Evidence was strongest for adverse associations of female exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls with TTP, with some additional support for associations of female exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers and PFAS with longer TTP. Our review provided little or no support for associations between female exposure to OC pesticides or male exposure to any of the POP groups and TTP. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Evidence suggests that female exposure to at least some POPs may reduce fecundability. Although many of these chemicals are no longer in production, they are still detectable in human biosamples because of their persistence in the environment. Replacement chemicals that are being introduced as older ones are restricted may have similar reproductive consequences. Future studies should examine these newer POPs, assess interactions between POPs and other chemical and non-chemical exposures, investigate how POPs are distributed in and metabolised by the human body and focus on populations that may be disproportionately exposed. © The Author(s) 2020.

Organic solvent reverse osmosis membranes for organic liquid mixture separation: A review,"Liu C., Dong G., Tsuru T., Matsuyama H.",2021,Journal of Membrane Science,"The separation of organic liquid mixtures by organic solvent reverse osmosis (OSRO) technology is promising owing to the high energy-efficiency. This article presents an overview of the endeavors made in the OSRO separation of organic liquid mixtures. First, the sub-nanometer separation characteristic of OSRO is introduced, and compared with pervaporation and organic solvent nanofiltration. Next, the mixtures of interest which may benefit from OSRO technology such as polar/nonpolar mixtures and their application scenarios are presented. The energy evaluation of OSRO, pervaporation, and distillation processes is also performed, highlighting the energy conservation feature of OSRO process. Subsequently, the OSRO membranes developed to date are comprehensively reviewed in term of their membrane materials, diving into organic (mainly cellulose types, polyethylene, polyamide, perfluoropolymer), inorganic (carbon molecular sieves, silica, zeolite), and composite (polymers of intrinsic microporosity-1/AlOx) materials. The OSRO separation performances of the developed membranes are summarized and compared in term of flux and separation factor. Finally, we provide perspectives regarding the challenges and state the concluding remarks, in the hope that this review will inspire future studies to address efficient OSRO separations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Energy-efficient process; Microporous material; Organic liquid separation; Organic solvent reverse osmosis membrane,"Composite membranes; Distillation; Energy efficiency; Evaporation; Liquids; Mixtures; Molecular sieves; Organic polymers; Organic solvents; Pervaporation; Reverse osmosis; Silica; Zeolites; Application scenario; Carbon molecular sieve; Distillation process; High energy efficiency; Organic solvent nanofiltration; Polymers of intrinsic microporosities; Separation of organic liquids; Separation performance; Osmosis membranes; 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidinone; alcohol derivative; alkane; aromatic compound; carbon molecular sieve; cellulose; dimethyl sulfoxide; inorganic compound; metal organic framework; n,n dimethylacetamide; n,n dimethylformamide; nanocomposite; organic solvent; perfluoropolymer; polyamide; polyethylene; polymer; silicon dioxide; water; zeolite; chemical reaction; comparative study; crystal; distillation; energy; energy conservation; evaluation study; isomer; membrane technology; molecular size; nanofiltration; organic chemistry; organic liquid mixture; pervaporation; porosity; priority journal; reverse osmosis; separation technique; Distillation; Evaporation; Liquids; Mixtures; Molecular Sieves; Reverse Osmosis",Elsevier B.V.
Network Analysis to Identify Communities Among Multiple Exposure Biomarkers Measured at Birth in Three Flemish General Population Samples,"Ottenbros I., Govarts E., Lebret E., Vermeulen R., Schoeters G., Vlaanderen J.",2021,Frontiers in Public Health,"Introduction: Humans are exposed to multiple environmental chemicals via different sources resulting in complex real-life exposure patterns. Insight into these patterns is important for applications such as linkage to health effects and (mixture) risk assessment. By providing internal exposure levels of (metabolites of) chemicals, biomonitoring studies can provide snapshots of exposure patterns and factors that drive them. Presentation of biomonitoring data in networks facilitates the detection of such exposure patterns and allows for the systematic comparison of observed exposure patterns between datasets and strata within datasets. Methods: We demonstrate the use of network techniques in human biomonitoring data from cord blood samples collected in three campaigns of the Flemish Environment and Health Studies (FLEHS) (sampling years resp. 2002–2004, 2008–2009, and 2013–2014). Measured biomarkers were multiple organochlorine compounds, PFAS and metals. Comparative network analysis (CNA) was conducted to systematically compare networks between sampling campaigns, smoking status during pregnancy, and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. Results: Network techniques offered an intuitive approach to visualize complex correlation structures within human biomonitoring data. The identification of groups of highly connected biomarkers, “communities,” within these networks highlighted which biomarkers should be considered collectively in the analysis and interpretation of epidemiological studies or in the design of toxicological mixture studies. Network analyses demonstrated in our example to which extent biomarker networks and its communities changed across the sampling campaigns, smoking status during pregnancy, and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. Conclusion: Network analysis is a data-driven and intuitive screening method when dealing with multiple exposure biomarkers, which can easily be upscaled to high dimensional HBM datasets, and can inform mixture risk assessment approaches. © Copyright © 2021 Ottenbros, Govarts, Lebret, Vermeulen, Schoeters and Vlaanderen.",community detection; human biomonitoring; mixtures; multiple exposure biomarkers; network analysis; risk assessment,"biological marker; chlorinated hydrocarbon; metal; biological monitoring; environmental monitoring; female; human; newborn; pregnancy; Biological Monitoring; Biomarkers; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Infant, Newborn; Metals; Pregnancy",Frontiers Media S.A.
Scoping review—the association between asthma and environmental chemicals,"Mattila T., Santonen T., Andersen H.R., Katsonouri A., Szigeti T., Uhl M., Wąsowicz W., Lange R., Bocca B., Ruggieri F., Kolossa-Gehring M., Sarigiannis D.A., Tolonen H.",2021,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide affecting all age groups from children to the elderly. In addition to other factors such as smoking, air pollution and atopy, some environmental chemicals are shown or suspected to increase the risk of asthma, exacerbate asthma symptoms and cause other respiratory symptoms. In this scoping review, we report environmental chemicals, prioritized for investigation in the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU), which are associated or possibly associated with asthma. The substance groups con-sidered to cause asthma through specific sensitization include: diisocyanates, hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) and possibly p-phenylenediamine (p-PDA). In epidemiological studies, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organophosphate insecticides are associated with asthma, and phthalates, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), pyrethroid insecticides, mercury, cad-mium, arsenic and lead are only potentially associated with asthma. As a conclusion, exposure to PAHs and some pesticides are associated with increased risk of asthma. Diisocyanates and Cr(VI) cause asthma with specific sensitization. For many environmental chemicals, current studies have provided contradicting results in relation to increased risk of asthma. Therefore, more research about exposure to environmental chemicals and risk of asthma is needed. © 2021 by the authors.

Antibiofilm peptides as a promising strategy: comparative research,"Li J., Chen D., Lin H.",2021,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,"Abstract: Biofilms lead to approximately 65% of infections, and these infections are hard to treat. Thus, it is crucial to identify effective antibiofilm agents with low cytotoxicity. Peptides with antibiofilm activity have been regarded as promising solutions, and peptides with MBICs (minimal biofilm inhibitory concentrations) that are lower than their minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) (minimal inhibitory concentrations) are appealing. Therefore, we systematically summarized and classified previously reported peptides with antibiofilm activity. A total of 51 peptides with antibiofilm activity were classified into 14 categories. The MICs and MBICs of these fourteen representative peptides, one selected from each category, were compared against the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus mutans, the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the fungus Candida albicans. Six representative peptides (C5-pleurocidin, C6-Pac-525, C9-protegrin-1, C11-TetraF2W-RR, C13-WLBU2, and C14-melittin) showed antibiofilm activity against both bacteria and fungi, and among these 6 representative peptides, 4 peptides (C9-protegrin-1, C11-TetraF2W-RR, C13-WLBU2, and C14-melittin) could prevent biofilm formation with lower MBIC values than their MICs. CLSM (confocal laser scanning microscopy), SEM (scanning electron microscopy), and TEM (transmission electron microscopy) were further used to observe the morphologies of the biofilms after treatment with the peptides. Among the above 4 peptides, WLBU2 and melittin sparsely scattered the biofilms without destroying the bacteria. In conclusion, the currently reported peptides with antibiofilm activity are limited in number, but peptides with lower MBICs than MICs exist as promising candidates against biofilm-related infections and need further study. Key points: • Antibiofilm peptides could inhibit biofilm formation with MBICs that are lower than MICs. • The mechanism of antibiofilm peptides is not only due to antimicrobial activity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.",Antibiofilm agents; Antibiofilm peptides; Antimicrobial peptides; Biofilm,Bacteria; Biofilms; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Microwave integrated circuits; Scanning electron microscopy; Anti-microbial activity; Confocal laser scanning microscopy; Gram-negative bacteria; Gram-positive bacterium; Inhibitory concentration; Minimal inhibitory concentration; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; TEM (transmission electron microscopy); Peptides; c1 hbd3; c10 peptide 3002; c11 tetraf2w rr; c12 p1; c13 wlbu2; c14 melittin; c3 muc7; c5 pleurocidin; c6 pac 525; c7 peptide 1037; c8 indolicidin; c9 protegrin 1; cathelicidin; indolicidin; melittin; nisin; polypeptide antibiotic agent; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; antimicrobial activity; bacterium; biofilm; comparative study; detection method; fungus; inhibition; inhibitor; microbial activity; peptide; amino acid sequence; antibiofilm activity; antimicrobial activity; Article; Candida albicans; concentration response; confocal laser scanning microscopy; data analysis software; effective concentration; minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; peptide synthesis; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; scanning electron microscopy; Streptococcus mutans; systematic review; transmission electron microscopy; biofilm; microbial sensitivity test; Candida albicans; Negibacteria; Posibacteria; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Streptococcus mutans; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Biofilms; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Streptococcus mutans,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
Metabolic engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chassis [代谢工程改造酿酒酵母底盘细胞],"Zhang Y., He D., Lu H., Huang J., Luo X.",2021,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae acts as a bio-foundry for producing natural products. S. cerevisiae's intrinsic pathways highlight microbial cell factories to produce pharmaceutics, food additive, and fine chemicals. For high-titer, yield, and conversion of target compounds, the critical point is that fine-tuning and optimizing intracellular metabolic flux in the yeast cell. Acetyl- CoA is the fundamental precursor for central metabolism and heterologous pathway. In comparison, acetyl-CoA compartmentalizes in mitochondria, nucleus, peroxisome subcellular, and cytosol. Most of the pathway enzymes are expressed in S. cerevisiae cytosol. So, we summarized the fine-tuning strategies of acetyl-CoA synthesis in cytosol matrix. The new acetyl-CoA pathway (phosphoketolase, phosphotransacetylase, and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, PK/PTA-ADA) shows a high conversion ratio from the carbon source. The PK/PTA-ADA pathway presents improved redox balance, limited ATP requirement, and reduced carbon loss to CO2. Moreover, the heterologous ATP-dependent citrate lyase precisely converts mitochondria metabolism into acetyl-CoA. Knock-out acetyl-CoA depletion pathways retain high acetyl-CoA titer in the cytosol. The continuous metabolic engineering on PK/PTA-ADA pathway is expected for higher acetyl-CoA titer. The Mevalonate pathway has been engineered to produce terpenoids in S. cerevisiae. The exogenous HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase boost mevalonate pathway from acetyl-CoA. Further, the diversified terpenoids are generated from C5 unite Isopentenyl diphosphate and its' isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate. Intrinsic farnesyl diphosphate synthase (Erg20) shows both dimethylallyltransferase (geranyl diphosphate, C10 product) and geranyltransferase (farnesyl diphosphate, C15 product) activity. The F96W/N127W mutations in Erg20 caused steric hindrance for geranyl diphosphate substrate. So, geranyl diphosphate is accumulated to produce C10 terpenoids or meroterpenoids. Moreover, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (CrtE) convert farnesyl diphosphate (C15) into geranylgeranyl diphosphate (C20) for carotene, lycopene, astaxanthin, and taxol, etc. Interestingly, the novel isopentenol utilization pathway has been constructed in E. coli and Y. lipolytica to supply IPP and IMAPP precursors from isopentanol. This alternative pathway could relieve the acetyl- CoA supply burden in the mevalonate pathway. Fatty acid synthase (FAS) produces fatty acid with specific carbon length and derivatives from acetyl-CoA and malonyl- CoA. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1) catalyzes acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA, which is utilized as the carbon unite in fatty acid pathway. Overexpression of ACC1 and mitochondria located isoenzyme Hfa1 significantly improves fatty acid production. FAS in S. cerevisiae is an α6β6 heterodimer protein and these catalytic domains are engineered to produce specific fatty acids. Directed mutations in ketoacyl synthase (KS), acetyltransferase (AT), and malonyl/palmitoyl transferase (MPT) domains engage FAS to generate high-yield short/medium fatty acid (C6 and C8). Furthermore, fatty acid reductase and acyl-ACP reductase convert fatty acid or fatty acyl-ACP to fatty aldehydes, respectively. Aldehyde deformylating oxygenase produces alkanes from fatty aldehydes substrate. Significantly, fatty acid-derived bio hydrocarbons showed closets properties to petroleum fuel. We reviewed the metabolic strategies of acetyl-CoA synthesis, the novel mevalonate pathway and fatty acid synthesis. These strategies may be valuable for producing high-yield terpene and fatty acid derivatives in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. © 2021, Science Press.

"Meteorological patterns, technical validation, and chemical comparison of atmospheric dust depositions and bulk sand in the Arabian Gulf region","Elsayed Y., Kanan S., Farhat A.",2021,Environmental Pollution,"This study reports seasonal variations of meteorological parameters, atmospheric dust and dust-borne heavy metals concentrations measured, over a period of two years, next to two major airports (Dubai International Airport and Abu Dhabi International Airport) in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. On-line monitoring stations were installed at each location next to dust samplers used to frequently collect PM2.5 and PM10 on Teflon filters for metal analysis. Clear seasonal variation in meteorological parameters were identified. The particulate matter concentrations depicted from the two locations were continuously monitored. The PM2.5 concentration ranged from 50 to 100 μg/m3 on normal days but reached 350–400 μg/m3 per day during mild storms. The PM10 levels ranged between 100 and 250 μg/m3 during normal days and spiked to 750 μg/m3 during mild storms. Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDS) revealed the presence of significant amounts of alkali and alkaline earth metals, which pose potential harm to aircraft engines. ICP analysis showed the presence of heavy and toxic metals in concentrations that may pose harm to human health. Bulk sand samples from Abu Dhabi sites showed chemical similarities to the atmospheric dust samples. The concentrations of heavy metals, PM2.5, and PM10 are at levels that require further monitoring due to their impact on human health. The two years meteorological monitoring, with the seasonal variations, provided additional regional data in the Arabian Gulf. Furthermore, the study concluded that Sand and Dust storms (SDS) occur more frequently at the northern Arabian Gulf compared to its southern region. The chemical correlation between atmospheric dust and regional desert sand suggests the localized origin of the smaller dust particles that may form by breaking apart of the ground sand grains. As a result of the ongoing urbanization in the region, it is essential to collect additional data from various locations for a longer period of time. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Arabian gulf; Dust; Dust storm; Heavy metals; PM10; PM2.5,Aircraft engines; Airports; Alkalinity; Atmospheric chemistry; Energy dispersive X ray analysis; Heavy metals; Location; Metal analysis; Sand; Storms; X ray diffraction analysis; Abu Dhabi international airport; Dubai International Airport; Gulf Cooperation Council; Metals concentrations; Meteorological monitoring; Meteorological parameters; Meteorological patterns; Northern arabian gulfs; Dust; alkali; alkaline earth metal; heavy metal; atmospheric deposition; concentration (composition); dust; dust storm; heavy metal; meteorology; sand; seasonal variation; Abu Dhabi; aircraft; airport; Article; chemical composition; comparative study; concentration (parameter); dust storm; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; health status; human; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; meteorological phenomena; online monitoring; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; Persian Gulf; seasonal variation; urbanization; air pollutant; dust; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; sand; season; Arabian Sea; Indian Ocean; Persian Gulf; Air Pollutants; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Sand; Seasons,Elsevier Ltd
Environmental substances associated with osteoporosis-a scoping review,"Elonheimo H., Lange R., Tolonen H., Kolossa-Gehring M.",2021,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Introduction: Osteoporosis is a disease having adverse effects on bone health and causing fragility fractures. Osteoporosis affects approximately 200 million people worldwide, and nearly 9 million fractures occur annually. Evidence exists that, in addition to traditional risk factors, certain environmental substances may increase the risk of osteoporosis. Methods: The European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU) is a joint program coordinating and advancing human biomonitoring in Europe. HBM4EU investigates citizens’ exposure to several environmental substances and their plausible health effects aiming to contribute to policymaking. In HBM4EU, 18 priority substances or substance groups were selected. For each, a scoping document was prepared summarizing existing knowledge and health effects. This scoping review is based on these chemical-specific scoping documents and complementary literature review. Results: A possible link between osteoporosis and the body burden of heavy metals, such as cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), and industrial chemicals such as phthalates and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) was identified. Conclusions: Evidence shows that environmental substances may be related to osteoporosis as an adverse health effect. Nevertheless, more epidemiological research on the relationship between health effects and exposure to these chemicals is needed. Study results are incoherent, and pervasive epidemiological studies regarding the chemical exposure are lacking. © 2021 by the authors.

From environmental to possible occupational exposure to risk factors: What role do they play in the etiology of endometriosis?,"Caporossi L., Capanna S., Viganò P., Alteri A., Papaleo B.",2021,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Endometriosis is a gynecological disorder characterized by the presence of endometrial stroma and glands outside the uterine cavity. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to clarify, starting from environmental exposure data, whether possible occupational risk factors may correlate with the onset of the disease. The guidelines for reporting systematic reviews of the “PRISMA” statement were followed and two databases, Scopus and PubMed, were used. Of the 422 studies selected with specific keywords, 32 publications were eligible, 28 of which referred to chemical agents and 4 related to night work. Conflicting data emerged among these studies. Although some compounds seemed to be more involved than others in the onset of endometriosis. Association with exposure to organochlorine compounds is the most supported by the epidemiological data, while other pesticide exposure did not show any clear correlation. Likewise, the hypothesis of a correlation with perfluoroalkyls exposure is not currently supported by data. The involvement of metals as risk factors has not been confirmed, while the role of night work, in the case of long service, seems to play an etiological role. In order to clarify the potential occupational risk of endometriosis development, well-designed studies are needed to evaluate the potential association between chemical compounds and disease etiology. © 2021 by the authors.

Accurate Removal of Toxic Organic Pollutants from Complex Water Matrices,"Cai J., Niu B., Xie Q., Lu N., Huang S., Zhao G., Zhao J.",2021,Environmental Science and Technology,"Characteristic emerging pollutants at low concentration have raised much attention for causing a bottleneck in water remediation, especially in complex water matrices where high concentration of interferents coexist. In the future, tailored treatment methods are therefore of increasing significance for accurate removal of target pollutants in different water matrices. This critical review focuses on the overall strategies for accurately removing highly toxic emerging pollutants in the presence of typical interferents. The main difficulties hindering the improvement of selectivity in complex matrices are analyzed, implying that it is difficult to adopt a universal approach for multiple targets and water substrates. Selective methods based on assorted principles are proposed aiming to improve the anti-interference ability. Thus, typical approaches and fundamentals to achieve selectivity are subsequently summarized including their mechanism, superiority and inferior position, application scope, improvement method and the bottlenecks. The results show that different methods may be applicable to certain conditions and target pollutants. To better understand the mechanism of each selective method and further select the appropriate method, advanced methods for qualitative and quantitative characterization of selectivity are presented. The processes of adsorption, interaction, electron transfer, and bond breaking are discussed. Some comparable selective quantitative methods are helpful for promoting the development of related fields. The research framework of selectivity removal and its fundamentals are established. Presently, although continuous advances and remarkable achievements have been attained in the selective removal of characteristic organic pollutants, there are still various substantial challenges and opportunities. It is hopeful to inspire the researches on the new generation of water and wastewater treatment technology, which can selectively and preferentially treat characteristic pollutants, and establish a reliable research framework to lead the direction of environmental science. ©",accurate removal; advanced treatment; complex water matrices; selective mechanism; toxic organic pollutants,Chemicals removal (water treatment); Environmental technology; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Accurate removal; Advanced treatment; Complex water matrix; Emerging pollutants; Interferents; Research frameworks; Selective mechanism; Target pollutants; Toxic organic pollutant; Water matrices; Organic pollutants,American Chemical Society
Molecular Gatekeeper Discovery: Workflow for Linking Multiple Exposure Biomarkers to Metabolomics,"Yu M., Teitelbaum S.L., Dolios G., Dang L.-H.T., Tu P., Wolff M.S., Petrick L.M.",2021,Environmental Science and Technology,"The exposome reflects multiple exposures across the life-course that can affect health. Metabolomics can reveal the underlying molecular basis linking exposures to health conditions. Here, we explore the concept and general data analysis framework of ""molecular gatekeepers""-key metabolites that link single or multiple exposure biomarkers with correlated clusters of endogenous metabolites-to inform health-relevant biological targets. We performed untargeted metabolomics on plasma from 152 adolescent girls participating in the Growing Up Healthy Study in New York City. We then performed network analysis to link metabolites to exposure biomarkers including five trace elements (Cd, Mn, Pb, Se, and Hg) and five perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs; n-PFOS, Sm-PFOS, n-PFOA, PFHxS, and PFNA). We found 144 molecular gatekeepers and annotated 22 of them. Lysophosphatidylcholine (16:0) and taurodeoxycholate were correlated with both n-PFOA and n-PFOS, suggesting a shared dysregulation from multiple xenobiotic exposures. Sphingomyelin (d18:2/14:0) was significantly associated with age at menarche; yet, no direct association was detected between any exposure biomarkers and age at menarche. Thus, molecular gatekeepers can also discover molecular linkages between exposure biomarkers and health outcomes that may otherwise be obscured by complex interactions in direct measurements. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

Effects of enhanced recovery after surgery on robotic radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Xing J., Wang J., Liu G., Jia Y.",2021,Gland Surgery,"Background: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) has been shown to be an effective, reliable and practical clinical nursing method to support operations on a range of physiological systems, but its effects on robotic radical prostatectomy (RRP) are still unclear. This study assesses the clinical effects of ERAS in RRP. Methods: Various databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and China National Knowledge were searched for relevant studies, in particular full-text articles comparing ERAS groups and conventional groups for RRP. All included articles were subject to a quality assessment, and the data analysis was conducted with Review Manager (5.3). Forest plots, sensitivity analyses, and bias analyses were also prepared based on the included articles. Results: In total, 8 studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that ERAS groups exhibited significantly reduced time of flatus [mean difference (MD) =-0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.88, -0.29; P=0.0001], time of catheter removal (MD =-1.65; 95% CI: -2.15, -1.16; P<0.00001), and length of stay (LOS) (MD =-1.49; 95% CI: -2.65, -0.34; P=0.01), and there was no significant difference in terms of postoperative complications between ERAS groups and conventional groups (P=0.07). Discussion: This study provides further evidence that ERAS improves postoperative recovery in patients undergoing RRP through reduced time of first flatus, time of catheter removal and LOS. Given the limited quality and quantity of the articles included in this study, further work is needed to validate these findings. © 2021 Gland Surgery.

Drug-disease interactions of differentially expressed genes in COVID-19 liver samples: an in-silico analysis [Interacciones fármaco –enfermedad de genes diferencialmente expresados en muestras de hígado de COVID-19: un análisis in-silico.],"Rasool S.O., Nahr A.M., Eskandari S., Hosseinzadeh M., Moghanloo S.A., Ebrahimzadeh F.",2021,Investigacion Clinica (Venezuela),"While COVID-19 liver injuries have been reported in various stud-ies, concerns are raised about disease-drug reactions in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we examined the hypothesis of gene-disease interactions in an in-silico model of gene expression to seek changes in cytochrome P450 genes. The Gene Expression Omnibus dataset of the liver autopsy in deceased COVID-19 patients (GSE150316) was used in this study. Non-alcoholic fatty liver biopsies were used as the control (GSE167523). Besides, gene expression analysis was performed using the DESeq/EdgeR method. The GO databases were used, and the paths were set at p<0.05. The drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb) was searched for in-teractions. According to the results, 5,147 genes were downregulated, and 5,122 genes were upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 compared to healthy livers. Compared to the cytochromes, 34 cytochromes were downregulated, while 4 cytochromes were upregulated among the detected differentially expressed genes (DEG). The drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb) provided a list of medications with potential interactions with COVID-19 as well as metacetamol, phenethyl iso-cyanate, amodiaquine, spironolactone, amiloride, acenocoumarol, clopidogrel, phenprocoumon, trimipramine, phenazepam, etc. Besides, dietary compounds of isoflavones, valerian, and coumarin, as well as caffeine metabolism were shown to have possible interactions with COVID-19 disease. Our study showed that expression levels of cytochrome P450 genes could get altered following COVID-19.

EDC-induced mechanisms of immunotoxicity: a systematic review,"Sabuz Vidal O., Deepika D., Schuhmacher M., Kumar V.",2021,Critical Reviews in Toxicology,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) refer to a group of chemicals that cause adverse effects in human health, impairing hormone production and regulation, resulting in alteration of homeostasis, reproductive, and developmental, and immune system impairments. The immunotoxicity of EDCs involves many mechanisms altering gene expression that depend on the activation of nuclear receptors such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the estrogen receptor (ER), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which also results in skin and intestinal disorders, microbiota alterations and inflammatory diseases. This systematic review aims to review different mechanisms of immunotoxicity and immunomodulation of T cells, focusing on T regulatory (Treg) and Th17 subsets, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) caused by specific EDCs such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), bisphenols (BPs) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). To achieve this objective, a systematic study was conducted searching various databases including PubMed and Scopus to find in-vitro, in-vivo, and biomonitoring studies that examine EDC-dependent mechanisms of immunotoxicity. While doing the systematic review, we found species- and cell-specific outcomes and a translational gap between in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. Finally, an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework is proposed, which explains mechanistically toxicity endpoints emerging from different EDCs having similar key events and can help to improve our understanding of EDCs mechanisms of immunotoxicity. In conclusion, this review provides insights into the mechanisms of immunotoxicity mediated by EDCs and will help to improve human health risk assessment. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",AOP; EDCs; immune cells; immunotoxicity; NRs,"endocrine disruptor; estrogen receptor; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; human; immune system; Endocrine Disruptors; Humans; Immune System; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Receptors, Estrogen",Taylor and Francis Ltd.
Nanofiltration for drinking water treatment: a review,"Guo H., Li X., Yang W., Yao Z., Mei Y., Peng L.E., Yang Z., Shao S., Tang C.Y.",2021,Frontiers of Chemical Science and Engineering,"In recent decades, nanofiltration (NF) is considered as a promising separation technique to produce drinking water from different types of water source. In this paper, we comprehensively reviewed the progress of NF-based drinking water treatment, through summarizing the development of materials/fabrication and applications of NF membranes in various scenarios including surface water treatment, groundwater treatment, water reuse, brackish water treatment, and point of use applications. We not only summarized the removal of target major pollutants (e.g., hardness, pathogen, and natural organic matter), but also paid attention to the removal of micropollutants of major concern (e.g., disinfection byproducts, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and arsenic). We highlighted that, for different applications, fit-for-purpose design is needed to improve the separation capability for target compounds of NF membranes in addition to their removal of salts. Outlook and perspectives on membrane fouling control, chlorine resistance, integrity, and selectivity are also discussed to provide potential insights for future development of high-efficiency NF membranes for stable and reliable drinking water treatment.

Recent Advances in Sensor-Based Detection of Toxic Dyes for Bioremediation Application: a Review,"Bhattacharjee J., Mishra S., Das A.P.",2021,Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology,"Extensive use of these harmful dyes has resulted in the surplus presence of these emerging pollutants in the environment, thus demanding an instant and sensitive detection method. Various synthetic dyes are illegitimately mixed into food and other consuming items for displaying bright colours that attracts consumers. The synthetic dyes cause a number of environmental health hazards and promote toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity in humans. Despite these serious health glitches, synthetic dyes are widely used due to their much lower cost. As a result, a faster, more selective and extremely sensitive technology for detecting and quantifying hazardous dyes in trace amount is urgently needed. This topic is currently in its initial phases of development and needs continuous refinements, such as explaining various sensing methods and potential future uses linked with dye detection technologies. The present review encompasses a comprehensive literature survey on detection of dyes and latest progress in developing sensors for dye detection and summarizes different detection mechanisms, including biosensor-, optical- and electrochemical-based sensors.

Challenges of TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis on cytostatic compounds degradation: state of the art,"González-Burciaga L.A., Núñez-Núñez C.M., Proal-Nájera J.B.",2021,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"The following work provides a perspective on the degradation of cytostatic pollutants through TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis. Cytostatic drugs are emerging pollutants used for cancer treatment found in hospital and domestic wastewater. Small amounts of cytostatic pollutants may pose severe health problems in human beings, animals, and plants after prolonged contact. This research presents a general review of some water treatment methods, such as aerobic activated sludge, enzymatic degradation, nanofiltration and chlorination, that have been used for the degradation or elimination of cytostatic drugs in wastewater. In recent years, photocatalysis has become important to solve this problem; these advanced oxidation process uses pure and modified TiO2 to degrade cytostatic contaminants and convert them into non-harmful substances or to eliminate them completely. This work contains a comprehensive review of the heterogeneous photocatalysis process and mechanism, and its application on the removal of cytostatic pollutants.

Surveying the Chemical Anthropocene Chemical Imaginaries and the Politics of Defining Toxicity,Hendlin Y.H.,2021,Environment and Society: Advances in Research,"Faced with the non-optional acceptance of toxic chemical artifacts, the ubiquitous interweaving of chemicals in our social fabric often exists out of sight and out of mind. Yet, for many, toxic exposures signal life-changing or life-ending events, phantom threats that fail to appear as such until they become too late to mitigate. Assessments of toxicological risk consist of what Sheila Jasanoff calls “sociotechnical imaginaries,” arbitrations between calculated costs and benefits, known risks and scientifically wrought justifications of safety. Prevalent financial conflicts of interest and the socially determined hazards posed by chemical exposure suggest that chemical safety assessments and regulations are a form of postnormal science. Focusing on the histories of risk assessments of pesticides such as DDT, atrazine, PFAS, and glyphosate, this article critically reviews Michel Serres's notion of “appropriation by contamination.” © 2021.

Stem Cells in Clinical Trials for Pelvic Floor Disorders: a Systematic Literature Review,"Manodoro S., Frigerio M., Barba M., Bosio S., de Vitis L.A., Marconi A.M.",2021,Reproductive Sciences,"Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) include a series of conditions that can be poorly tolerated, negatively affecting the quality of life. Current treatment options show unsatisfactory results and new ones are therefore needed. Stem cell (SC) therapy might be an alternative treatment strategy. This systematic review aims to define the state of art of SC therapy for PFDs in clinical trials, by systematically reviewing the available evidence. A systematic search strategy was conducted up to November 7, 2020, in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Science. Preclinical studies on animal models were not considered. Studies were included when the patients were affected by any PFDs and cells were isolated, cultured, and characterized as SC. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020216551). A total of 11 prospective clinical studies were included in the final assessment, specifically 7 single-arm studies dealing with SC therapy for stress urinary incontinence and 4 with anal incontinence. Among the latter, there were two prospective, single-arm studies and two randomized controlled trials. No papers concerning the use of SC for prolapse repair were retrieved. Due to the great heterogeneity, data pooling was not possible. Stem cell injection resulted in a safe procedure, with few mild adverse side effects, mostly related to harvesting sites. However, a clear beneficial impact of SC treatment for the treatment of pelvic floor disorders could not be demonstrated. Further larger targeted studies with control arms are needed before any conclusions can be made. © 2021, The Author(s).",Anal incontinence; Pelvic floor disorders; Regenerative medicine; Stem cells; Stress urinary incontinence; Systematic review; Tissue engineering,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
Free throw shooting performance under pressure: a social psychology critical review of research,"Goldschmied N., Raphaeli M., Moothart S., Furley P.",2021,International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology,"The Free-Throw Shot (FTS) in basketball is a unique uncontested closed skill undertaken during a stoppage in play at a uniform distance. In recent years, FTS has emerged as a prime target for stress research due to its highly controlled nature and its significant impact on the game outcome. In this narrative review, we appraise empirical research with a social-psychological focus on studying FTS success under pressure. This critical review comprises 44 empirical studies published up to June 2020. We first assess the importance of FTS within the game of basketball and study historical trends. We then elaborate on the unique psychological features of FTS. Subsequently, research on the undermining effects of pressure from both archival game studies and experiments is critically evaluated. We conclude with a discussion of performance in relationship to expertise and sources of threat. The review highlights current research deficiencies, provides recommendations for theoretical research and applied practice. © 2021 International Society of Sport Psychology.",choking; expertise; Free-throw shot; performance; pressure,,Routledge
Identification and Characterization of a Novel Carboxylesterase Belonging to Family VIII with Promiscuous Acyltransferase Activity Toward Cyanidin-3-O-Glucoside from a Soil Metagenomic Library,"Zhang Y., Ding L., Yan Z., Zhou D., Jiang J., Qiu J., Xin Z.",2021,Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology,"An alkaline esterase, designated as EstXT1, was identified through functional screening from a metagenomic library. Sequence analysis revealed that EstXT1 belonged to the family VIII carboxylesterases and contained a characteristic conserved S-x-x-K motif and a deduced catalytic triad Ser56-Lys59-Tyr165. EstXT1 exhibited the strongest activity toward methyl ferulate at pH 8.0 and temperature 55°C and retained over 80% of its original activity after incubation in the pH range of 7.0–10.6 buffers. Biochemical characterization of the recombinant enzyme showed that it was activated by Zn2+ and Co2+ metal ion, while inhibited by Cu2+ and CTAB. EstXT1 exhibited significant promiscuous acyltransferase activity preferred to the acylation of benzyl alcohol acceptor using short-chain pNP-esters (C2-C8) as acyl-donors. A structure–function analysis indicated that a WAG motif is essential to acyltransferase activity. This is the first report example that WAG motif plays a pivotal role in acyltransferase activity in family VIII carboxylesterases beside WGG motif. Further experiment indicated that EstXT1 successfully acylated cyanidin-3-O-glucoside in aqueous solution. The results from the current investigation provided new insights for the family VIII carboxylesterase and lay a foundation for the potential applications of EstXT1 in food and biotechnology fields. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Acyltransferase activity; Carboxylesterases; Enzymatic properties; Functional screening; Metagenomic approaches,Acylation; Carbohydrates; Enzymes; Esters; Metal ions; Metals; Biochemical characterization; Carboxylesterases; Catalytic triad; Function analysis; Functional screening; Metagenomic libraries; Recombinant enzymes; Sequence analysis; Alkalinity,Springer
"A Critical Review on Transplacental Transfer of Per- And Polyfluoroalkyl Substances: Prenatal Exposure Levels, Characteristics, and Mechanisms","Ma D., Lu Y., Liang Y., Ruan T., Li J., Zhao C., Wang Y., Jiang G.",2021,Environmental Science and Technology,"Prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) has aroused public concerns as it can pose multiple health threats to pregnant women and cause adverse birth outcomes for fetuses. In previous studies, the prenatal exposure levels and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTE) of PFASs have been reported and discussed. Specifically, the binding affinities between PFASs and some transporters were determined, demonstrating that the TTE values of PFASs are highly dependent on their binding behaviors. To summarize primary findings of previous studies and propose potential guidance for future research, this article provides a systematic overview on levels and characteristics of prenatal exposure to PFASs worldwide, summarizes relationships between TTE values and structures of PFASs, and discusses possible transplacental transfer mechanisms, especially for the combination between PFASs and transporters. Given the critical roles of transporters in the transplacental transfer of PFASs, we conducted molecular docking to further clarify the binding behaviors between PFASs and the selected transporters. We proposed that the machine learning can be a superior method to predict and reveal behaviors and mechanisms of the transplacental transfer of PFASs. In total, this is the first review providing a comprehensive overview on the prenatal exposure levels and transplacental transfer mechanisms of PFASs. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",molecular docking; perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances; prenatal exposure; quantitative structure-activity relationship; transplacental transfer,Binding energy; Binding affinities; Binding behaviors; Critical review; Molecular docking; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Prenatal exposure; Public concern; Transplacental transfers; Health risks; human; molecular docking; placental transfer; prenatal exposure; quantitative structure activity relation; review,American Chemical Society
Employing in vitro metabolism to guide design of F-labelled PET probes of novel α-synuclein binding bifunctional compounds,"Nwabufo C.K., Aigbogun O.P., Allen K.J.H., Owens M.N., Lee J.S., Phenix C.P., Krol E.S.",2021,Xenobiotica,"A challenge in the development of novel 18F-labelled positron emission tomography (PET) imaging probes is identification of metabolically stable sites to incorporate the 18F radioisotope. Metabolic loss of 18F from PET probes in vivo can lead to misleading biodistribution data as displaced 18F can accumulate in various tissues. In this study we report on in vitro hepatic microsomal metabolism of novel caffeine containing bifunctional compounds (C8-6-I, C8-6-N, C8-6-C8) that can prevent in vitro aggregation of α-synuclein, which is associated with the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease. The metabolic profile obtained guided us to synthesize stable isotope 19F-labelled analogues in which the fluorine was introduced at the metabolically stable N7 of the caffeine moiety. An in vitro hepatic microsomal metabolism study of the 19F-labelled analogues resulted in similar metabolites to the unlabelled compounds and demonstrated that the fluorine was metabolically stable, suggesting that these analogues are appropriate PET imaging probes. This straightforward in vitro strategy is valuable for avoiding costly stability failures when designing radiolabelled compounds for PET imaging. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",alpha-synuclein; Imaging probe design; Microsomal metabolism; Parkinson’s disease; Positron Emission Tomography,alpha synuclein; caffeine; chlorzoxazone; drug metabolite; fluorine 18; fluorine derivative; radioisotope; stable isotope; alpha synuclein; fluorine; animal cell; Article; biotransformation; controlled study; drug design; drug metabolism; drug stability; drug structure; drug synthesis; hydroxylation; in vitro study; liver microsome; microsome; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; pathophysiology; positron emission tomography; protein aggregation; radiolabeling; rat; tandem mass spectrometry; positron emission tomography; tissue distribution; alpha-Synuclein; Fluorine Radioisotopes; Positron-Emission Tomography; Tissue Distribution,Taylor and Francis Ltd.
To which extent are per-and poly-fluorinated substances associated to metabolic syndrome?,"Zare Jeddi M., Soltanmohammadi R., Barbieri G., Fabricio A.S.C., Pitter G., Dalla Zuanna T., Canova C.",2021,Reviews on Environmental Health,"Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), ubiquitous persistent environmental contaminants, has led to substantial global concern due to their potential environmental and human health effects. Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between PFAS exposure and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the results are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFAS and MetS. We performed a systematic search strategy using three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies concerning the associations of PFAS with MetS and its clinical relevance from inception until January 2021. We undertook meta-analyses where there were five or more studies with exposure and outcomes assessments that were reasonably comparable. The pooled odd ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects models and heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 index and Q test. A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (10 studies on the general population and two studies in the occupational settings) investigated the association between PFAS exposure and MetS. We pooled data from seven studies on the general population for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and five studies for perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Predominately, most studies reported no statistically significant association between concentrations of PFAS and MetS. In the meta-analysis, the overall measure of effect was not statistically significant, showing no evidence of an association between concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS and the risk of MetS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, current small body of evidence does not support association between PFAS and MetS. However, due to limited number of studies and substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Further scrutinizing cohort studies are needed to evaluate the association between various and less well-known PFAS substances and their mixture with MetS and its components in both adults and children in different settings. © 2021 Maryam Zare Jeddi et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2021.",cardiometabolic risk factors; forever chemicals; insulin resistance; metabolic outcome; systematic review,,De Gruyter Open Ltd
"Critical review on PFOA, kidney cancer, and testicular cancer","Bartell S.M., Vieira V.M.",2021,Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association,"The carcinogenicity of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been reviewed previously by several different regulatory agencies and researchers, with contradictory conclusions–especially regarding epidemiological findings on kidney cancer and testicular cancer. In addition, previous dose-response assessments have focused primarily on evidence from animal studies. This critical review summarizes peer reviewed epidemiological studies on PFOA and cancers of the kidneys and testes, using modified Hill’s criteria to assess the evidence for causation. We converted exposures to a common scale based on serum PFOA concentrations and applied meta-analysis to estimate the average increase in cancer risk reported by the studies with sufficient information to estimate serum PFOA. Using random effects meta-analysis, we found that the average relative increase in cancer risk per 10 ng/mL increase in serum PFOA for these studies is 16% (95% CI: 3%, 30%) for kidney cancer and 3% (95% CI: 2%, 4%) for testicular cancer. These associations are most likely causal, but results are limited by the small number of studies for testicular cancer, the overlapping study populations for several studies, and the lack of measured or modeled serum PFOA concentrations for several studies. Implications: Our review meta-analysis indicates an average increase in cancer risk per 10 ng/mL increase in serum PFOA for kidney and testicular cancers. These associations are most likely causal, but results are limited by the small number of studies for testicular cancer, the overlapping study populations for several studies, and the lack of measured or modeled serum PFOA concentrations for several studies. The weight of evidence could be even stronger with the addition of future studies conducted in large cohorts. © 2021 A&WMA.",,Random processes; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Animal studies; Critical review; Dose-response assessments; Epidemiological studies; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Random effects; Regulatory agencies; Weight of evidences; Diseases; biological product; perfluorooctanoic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; biological monitoring; cancer risk; carcinogenicity; dose response; human; kidney cancer; male; meta analysis (topic); nonhuman; peer review; priority journal; Review; study design; testis cancer; animal; kidney tumor; meta analysis; testis tumor; Animals; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Testicular Neoplasms,"Bellwether Publishing, Ltd."

The Diagnostic Conundrum of Retinitis and a Pigmented Scar,"Khandwala N.S., Miller J.M.L., Hyde R.A., Conrady C.D., Rao R.C., Besirli C.G.",2021,Case Reports in Ophthalmology,"We report a finding of a pigmented chorioretinal scar with acute retinal necrosis (ARN) caused by herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection rather than toxoplasma, creating an initial diagnostic dilemma. A 53-year-old functionally monocular male presented with painless floaters and blurry vision in his seeing eye over a period of 4 days. An exam demonstrated anterior chamber (AC) reaction, vitritis, multifocal patches of whitening, and an occlusive retinal vasculitis. A superior pigmented chorioretinal scar with overlying contracted vitreous was noted in the periphery with no adjacent retinal whitening. The patient was treated for both ARN and toxoplasma chorioretinitis until PCR study of the vitreous and AC returned positive for HSV-2 and negative for toxoplasmosis. Management consisted of a dual therapy regimen of both oral and intravitreal antiviral agents as well as oral corticosteroids. The patient's clinical course was complicated by rhegmatogenous retinal detachment within 2 weeks after symptom onset, requiring pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil and intraoperative intraocular incubation with foscarnet. We review emerging evidence for pigmented chorioretinal scars in ARN specifically caused by HSV-2, as well as diagnostic and treatment dilemmas in the management of ARN and ARN detachments. © 2021 S.

Efficacy of new emerging surgical approaches for macular hole retinal detachment in myopic patients; a systematic review,"Bagheri M., Najafi A., Eftekhari Milani A., Hazeri S.",2021,Expert Review of Ophthalmology,"Introduction: Despite recent developments, surgical treatment of retinal detachment secondary to macular hole (MHRD) in myopic patients remains a challenge. This review aims to compare the success rate of two recently emerged surgical approaches: internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling or inverted flap with intraocular tamponade as surgical treatment for MHRD in high myopia. Areas covered: This article primarily includes the following sections: literature searches, selection study and assessment, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and statistical analysis. Fifteen studies covering 362 patients were included and reviewed to compare the success rate of different surgical approaches, ILM peeling vs. inverted flap and intraocular tamponade as an adjunct to pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for treatment of MHRD. Expert opinion: There is evidence that the anatomical surgical success rate (macular hole closure and retinal reattachment) of the PPV with inverted ILM flap is higher than the conventional ILM peeling. Also, regarding the proper intraocular tamponade, long-term types have increased the success rate of surgery, so perfluoropropane (C3F8) and silicone oil (SO) are preferred over sulfur-hexafluoride (SF6). So, this review introduces PPV combined with inverted ILM flap and adjuvant long-term intraocular endotamponade as mainstream surgical methods for MHRD in myopic patients. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Macular hole; pars plana vitrectomy; pathologic myopia; retinal detachment; silicone oil,perflutren; silicone; silicone oil; sulfur hexafluoride; disease severity; dispersity; endotamponade; human; intraocular pressure; meta analysis; outcome assessment; Review; vitrectomy; vitreoretinopathy,Taylor and Francis Ltd.
Midterm results of modern patellofemoral arthroplasty versus total knee arthroplasty for isolated patellofemoral arthritis: systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative studies,"Elbardesy H., McLeod A., Gul R., Harty J.",2021,Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery,"Background: Both Patellofemoral Arthroplasty (PFA) and Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) are accepted surgical options for end-stage isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare outcomes of PFA and TKA by evaluation of the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Methods: We systematically identified publications reporting on patients that underwent either TKA or modern PFA for isolated PFOA. Meta-analysis software was used to screen for potential articles with at least two years’ follow-up. Data were extracted and analysed for all PROMs operating time, postoperative inpatient time, complications and cost. We included five studies in our cumulative meta-analysis and reviewed them using Review Manager V.5.0. We computed the risk ratio as a measure of the treatment effect, taking into account heterogeneity. We used random-effect models. Results: No significant difference was found between both TKA and PFA in the context of operating time. No significant difference after five years’ follow-up was found between the two treatment options in terms of UCLA score and patient satisfaction. PFA showed significant improvement in WOMAC score at five-year follow-up, less postoperative inpatient time, better cost-effectiveness and significantly less blood loss. Conclusion: PFA seems to be a viable alternative to TKA for treatment of isolated PFOA in appropriately selected patients. PFA showed less postoperative inpatient time and blood loss with similar PROMs to the TKA. Moreover, it is an economically beneficial joint-preserving procedure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Arthroplasty; Meta-analysis; Patellofemoral arthritis; Patellofemoral replacement; Total knee replacement,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
Endocrine disrupting chemicals and breast cancer: a systematic review of epidemiological studies,"Wan M.L.Y., Co V.A., El-Nezami H.",2021,Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition,"Background: Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) are ubiquitous substances that are found in our everyday lives, including pesticides, plasticizers, pharmaceutical agents, personal care products, and also in food products and food packaging. Increasing epidemiological evidence suggest that EDCs may affect the development or progression of breast cancer and consequently lead to lifelong harmful health consequences, especially when exposure occurs during early life in humans. Yet so far no appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic. Objective: To systematically review all the available epidemiological studies about the association of the levels of environmental exposures of EDCs with breast cancer risk. Methods: The search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved articles from PubMed (MEDLINE) until 10 March 2021. The key words used in this research were: “Endocrine disruptor(s)” OR “Endocrine disrupting chemical(s)” OR any of the EDCs mentioned below AND “Breast cancer” to locate all relevant articles published. We included only cohort studies and case-control studies. All relevant articles were accessed in full text and were evaluated and summarized in tables. Results: We identified 131 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. EDCs reviewed herein included pesticides (e.g. p,p’-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), atrazine, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin)), synthetic chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), parabens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contraceptive pills), phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein, resveratrol), and certain mycotoxins (e.g. zearalenone). Most studies assessed environmental EDCs exposure via biomarker measurements. Conclusion: We identified certain EDC exposures could potentially elevate the risk of breast cancer. As majority of EDCs are highly persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative, it is essential to assess the long-term impacts of EDC exposures, especially multi-generational and transgenerational. Also, since food is often a major route of exposure to EDCs, well-designed exposure assessments of potential EDCs in food and food packing are necessary and their potential link to breast cancer development need to be carefully evaluated for subsequent EDC policy making and regulations. © 2021 The Author(s).

Enantioselective behavior of environmental chiral pollutants: A comprehensive review,"Arenas M., Martín J., Santos J.L., Aparicio I., Alonso E.",2021,Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology,"Enantiomeric profiling of chiral environmental contaminants is an actual and imperative issue. Despite having similar physicochemical properties, enantiomers may differ in their interactions with enzymes, receptors and other chiral molecules leading to different biological response. Their differences in bio-degradation, transformation or accumulation should be carefully considered when assessing health risks since they can affect living organisms in a different way. This work reviews the behavior of several groups of environmentally relevant chiral contaminants including pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, perfluoroalkyl substances, brominated flame retardants, pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls and their main metabolites. The enantioselectivity and fate of these compounds in: i) wastewater treatment plants, ii) aquatic and terrestrial environments; and iii) living organisms is discussed. It cannot be predicted whether each specific enantiomer of a chiral compound will be preferably enriched or degraded. The extent of stereoselectivity is associated to several factors, including the specific chiral pollutant, the environmental matrix, the treatment technology used, as well as the season and local environmental factors (pH, soil texture, porosity, organic amended), which are in turn influenced by the activity of the microbial communities. Therefore the environmental fate of enantiomers always needs to be investigated. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Chiral pollutants; degradation; enantiomeric fraction; environment; fate,Aquatic organisms; Enantiomers; Enantioselectivity; Environmental technology; Flame retardants; Health risks; Metabolites; Organic pollutants; Physicochemical properties; Risk assessment; Sewage treatment plants; Textures; Wastewater treatment; Brominated flame retardants; Environmental contaminant; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Personal care products; Pharmaceutical compounds; Terrestrial environments; Treatment technologies; Wastewater treatment plants; Stereochemistry,"Bellwether Publishing, Ltd."
Advances and ongoing controversies in PFO closure and cryptogenic stroke,"Cheng T., Gonzalez J.B., Testai F.D.",2021,Handbook of Clinical Neurology,"Approximately one-third of strokes are cryptogenic in origin. These patients have a higher prevalence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) compared to individuals with stroke of known origin. It has been proposed that some cryptogenic strokes (CSs) can be caused by paradoxical embolism across a PFO. PFOs can be treated medically with antithrombotic agents and percutaneously with occluder devices. Large randomized clinical trials have found transcatheter PFO closure to be superior to medical treatment for the prevention of recurrent stroke in young patients with CS. However, the superiority of PFO closure over medical treatment in unselected populations has not been demonstrated. In this chapter, we review the evidence supporting PFO closure and the selection of patients for such intervention. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Cryptogenic stroke; Embolic stroke of undetermined source; Patent foramen ovale; PFO closure,"brain ischemia; complication; heart catheterization; human; paradoxical embolism; patent foramen ovale; secondary prevention; treatment outcome; Cardiac Catheterization; Embolism, Paradoxical; Foramen Ovale, Patent; Humans; Ischemic Stroke; Secondary Prevention; Treatment Outcome",Elsevier B.V.

Methods: The Smith & Nephew InterTan IDL was compared with SL CMN group consisting of the Stryker Gamma-3 (G3) and Synthes Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA) CMN. A multi-database search was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Data from studies assessing the clinical and radiological outcomes, complications and perioperative parameters of InterTan versus G3 or PFNA CMN in patients with intertrochanteric femoral fractures were extracted and analysed. Results: 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis, consisting of 2643 patients. InterTan was associated with lower complication rates in terms of all-cause revisions (OR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22–0.51; p < 0.001), cut-outs (OR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.17–0.51; p < 0.001), medial or lateral screw migration (OR 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06–0.65; p = 0.008) as well as persistent hip and thigh pain (OR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47–0.90; p = 0.008). In terms of perioperative parameters, InterTan is associated with longer operative times (MD 5.57 minutes; 95% CI, 0.37–10.78 minutes, p = 0.04) and fluoroscopy times (MD 38.89 seconds, 95% CI, 15.88–61.91 seconds; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of clinical Harris Hip Score and radiological outcomes, non-union, haematoma, femoral fractures, varus collapse, length of stay and mean intraoperative blood loss between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Integrated dual lag screw cephalomedullary nails are associated with fewer revisions and complications. However, there is insufficient data to suggest that either nail construct is associated with better functional outcomes. © The Author(s) 2021.",Gamma-3; hip fracture; InterTan; intramedullary nail; Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA),,SAGE Publications Ltd
"Low-cost adsorbents for environmental pollution control: a concise systematic review from the prospective of principles, mechanism and their applications",Tony M.A.,2021,Journal of Dispersion Science and Technology,"Nowadays, water scarcity is an identifiable problem facing society. However, as a result of modernization, water consumption is dramatically in increase although the water supply remains constant. Unfortunately every sector consumes water resulting in massive amounts of wastewater that requires treatment prior to their final disposal that still a challenge to the modern societies. Among the various technologies investigated, adsorption considered the most widely applied technology for safe environmental remediation. In this regard, the term of green adsorbents is introduced that is meant the low-cost materials originated from waste, i.e., agriculture waste to be valuable adsorbents. Thus, extensive list of different adsorbents from natural, industrial waste, agriculture bio-products or modified materials have been applied for the elimination of various contaminants from aqueous matrix are compiled here as a demanding area since it has double benefits as an industrial ecology approach. Also, this article discusses the basic principles of adsorption process including the adsorption isotherm and kinetic models. Although numerous review articles are dealing with low-cost adsorption performances, there is insufficient information on the emerging pollutants elimination. The major focus of this work is highlighting the research on the application of the low-cost adsorbents on the emerging pollutants, namely, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, personal care products and perfluorinated compounds. Scattered information on using various adsorbents are provided information in adsorbing emerging pollutants uptake reached to 920 mg/g. The main parameters that affect the adsorption process and the economic prospective is also discussed. Desorption and recycling scenario is concluded and desorption efficiency could reach to 99%. Finally, the future development of further research and few suggestions are also prospected. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Adsorption; industrial ecology; natural waste; waste management; wastewater treatment,Adsorption; Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Bioproducts; Costs; Desorption; Efficiency; Environmental technology; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Water supply; Adsorption performance; Desorption efficiency; Emerging pollutants; Environmental pollution control; Environmental remediation; Perfluorinated compounds; Personal care products; Various technologies; Pollution control,"Bellwether Publishing, Ltd."
On the Calculation of Optical Characteristics and Dimensional Shifts of Surface Plasmons of Spherical Bimetallic Nanoparticles,"Korotun A.V., Pogosov V.V.",2021,Physics of the Solid State,"Abstract: Formulas of efficient relaxation time are obtained for the cases when the free length of electrons is less or comparable with the characteristic dimensions of metallic regions. The frequency dispersion of optical characteristics of spherical bimetallic particles is calculated near plasma resonance in the absence of quantum-size effects. Retaining the style of common description of metallic particles based on the Mie–Drude theories, the frequency dependence of electric dipole polarizability of a two-layered metallic nanosphere was analyzed. The appearance of two polarizability maxima is the result of a difference in core and shell metals. The calculations are conducted for the following particles immersed into teflon: Au@Ag, Ag@Au, Au@Pt, Pt@Au, and Pt@Pd. It is demonstrated that the optical characteristics of bimetallic particles can be controlled by means of changing their composition and volumetric metal content. Cross-sections of absorption and scattering, as well as optical radiation efficiency of the particles in a wide spectrum range are calculated. Possible temperature of bimetallic particles at the absorption of an electromagnetic wave (for the photothermal therapy of malignant tumors) is estimated. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",absorption cross-section; bimetallic nanoparticle; polarizability; relaxation time; scattering cross-section; surface plasmon,,Pleiades journals
"Hydroprocessing of oleic acid for the production of aviation turbine fuel range hydrocarbons over bimetallic Fe-Cu/SiO2-Al2O3 catalysts promoted by Sn, Ti and Zr","Ayandiran A.A., Boahene P.E., Nanda S., Dalai A.K., Hu Y.",2021,Molecular Catalysis,"In this work, the synergistic effects of 1 wt.% Ti, 1 wt.% Zr, and Sn in the range of 0.5−2 wt.% on Fe(3)-Cu(13)/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst were ascertained through extensive characterization and their subsequent evaluation for the production of aviation turbine fuel range hydrocarbons (C8-C16) via hydroprocessing of oleic acid. The largest surface area (571 m2/g) and pore volume (0.65 cm3/g) were obtained from the N2 physisorption analysis of 1 wt.% Sn-promoted catalyst (E). Cu2O and CuO were identified in the X-ray diffractograms (XRD) of all the catalysts except for catalyst E, which revealed only the peaks of Cu2O owing to the small particle size of CuO below the threshold of detection of XRD. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed the presence of both oxidized and reduced phases of Cu, Fe, Ti, Zr and Sn in their respective catalysts, with the highest and lowest atomic compositions of reduced Fe and CuO, respectively, detected in catalyst E; corroborating findings from XRD analyses. The relatively homogeneous dispersion of phases present in catalyst E (revealed by its smallest crystallite size of 5.1 nm) was also evidenced by the weakest metal-support interaction from the H2-TPR analysis of the same catalyst. Hydroprocessing of oleic acid using catalyst E at 320 °C under H2 pressure of 2.1 MPa and reaction time of 8 h resulted in the highest aviation turbine fuel range hydrocarbons selectivity of 76.8 % and yield of 71.7 %. This was due to its high metal dispersion, desirable textural properties and high oxophilic reduced iron content. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Aviation turbine fuel; Hydroprocessing; metal–support interaction; Oleic acid; Sn-promoted catalyst,Copper metallography; Copper oxides; Crystallite size; Dispersions; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Hydrocracking; Iron metallography; Metal analysis; Monounsaturated fatty acids; Oleic acid; Oxide minerals; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Tin; Tin compounds; Tin metallography; Titanium; Titanium metallography; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Zirconium metallography; Atomic compositions; Aviation turbine fuels; Homogeneous dispersions; Metal-support interactions; Promoted catalysts; Small particle size; Textural properties; X-ray diffractograms; Catalyst selectivity,Elsevier B.V.
Comparison of clinical and radiological outcomes in intertrochanteric fractures treated with InterTAN nail against conventional cephalomedullary nails: A systematic review,"Date A., Panthula M., Bolina A.",2021,Future Science OA,"Intertrochanteric fractures, accountable for 50% of hip fractures, can be fixed with cephalomedullary devices such as Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA™), Gamma3 nailing system and TRIGEN™ InterTAN™ nail (IT). IT uniquely uses two cephalocervical screws that allow for linear compression and provide additional resistance to femoral head rotation. A literature review assessing clinical outcomes of these devices was conducted, with 14 studies enrolling 3104 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. PFNA and Gamma3 had better intraoperative outcomes compared with IT; however, IT had superior implant-related outcomes of cut-out and screw migration. No difference was found between IT and PFNA or Gamma3 in Harris Hip Scores, time to union, malunion and nonunion. Further long-term studies are needed to evaluate clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of cephalomedullary devices. Hip fractures remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality within healthcare systems, with an estimated global incidence of 1.6 million fractures annually. Certain intertrochanteric fractures - a specific subtype of hip fractures - are treated surgically using intramedullary nailing devices such as Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA™), Gamma3 nailing system and InterTAN™ nail (IT). IT is unique, in that it uses two proximal screws. This study assessed the clinical and radiological outcomes of using IT over the traditional one-screw devices PFNA and Gamma3. © 2020 Akshay Date.",,bone density; debridement; drug delivery system; femoral neck fracture; femur intertrochanteric fracture; fluoroscopy; fracture fixation; fracture healing; fracture nonunion; hip fracture; hospital readmission; human; intramedullary nailing; length of stay; life expectancy; lung embolism; morbidity; mortality; nonhuman; operation duration; osteoporosis; outcome assessment; periprosthetic fracture; postoperative complication; postoperative pain; primary osteoporosis; Review; robot-assisted prostatectomy; spondylolisthesis; systematic review; urinary tract infection; wound infection,Future Medicine Ltd.
Human exposure pathways to poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from indoor media: A systematic review protocol,"DeLuca N.M., Angrish M., Wilkins A., Thayer K., Cohen Hubal E.A.",2021,Environment International,"Background: Human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been primarily attributed to contaminated food and drinking water. However, additional PFAS exposure pathways have been raised by a limited number of studies reporting correlations between commercial and industrial products and PFAS levels in human media and biomonitoring. Systematic review (SR) methodologies have been widely used to evaluate similar questions using an unbiased approach in the fields of clinical medicine, epidemiology, and toxicology, but the deployment in exposure science is ongoing. Here we present a systematic review protocol that adapts existing systematic review methodologies and study evaluation tools to exposure science studies in order to investigate evidence for important PFAS exposure pathways from indoor media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, plus indoor air and dust. Objectives: We will systematically review exposure science studies that present both PFAS concentrations from indoor exposure media and PFAS concentrations in blood serum or plasma. Exposure estimates will be synthesized from the evidence to answer the question, “For the general population, what effect does exposure from PFAS chemicals via indoor media have on blood, serum or plasma concentrations of PFAS?” We adapt existing systematic review methodologies and study evaluation tools from the U.S. EPA's Systematic Review Protocol for the PFBA, PFHxA, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDA IRIS Assessments and the Navigation Guide for exposure science studies, as well as present innovative developments of exposure pathway-specific search strings for use in artificial intelligence screening software. Data Sources: We will search electronic databases for potentially relevant literature, including Web of Science, PubMed, and ProQuest. Literature search results will be stored in EPA's Health and Environmental Research Online (HERO) database. Study eligibility and criteria: Included studies will present exposure measures from indoor media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, plus indoor air and dust, paired with PFAS concentrations in blood, serum or plasma from adults and/or children in the general population. We focus on a subset of PFAS chemicals including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Studies will be prefiltered at the title and abstract level using computationally intelligent search strings to expedite the screening process for reviewers. Two independent reviewers will screen the prefiltered studies against inclusion criteria at the title/abstract level and then full-text level, after which the reviewers will assess the studies’ risk of bias using an approach modified from established systematic review tools for exposure studies. Exposure estimates will be calculated to investigate the proportion of blood, serum or plasma) PFAS concentrations that can be explained by exposure to PFAS in indoor media. © 2020",Exposure pathways; Human exposure; Indoor; PFAS; Systematic review,Air cleaners; Consumer products; Diagnosis; Dust; Environmental Protection Agency; Intelligent computing; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Potable water; Risk assessment; Environmental researches; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Perfluorononanoic acids; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Personal care products; Plasma concentration; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Blood; domestic chemical; perfluoroalkanoic acid; perfluorobutanesulfonic acid; perfluorobutanoic acid; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; drinking water; fluorocarbon; concentration (composition); drinking water; food; health risk; indoor air; pollution exposure; surfactant; ambient air; Article; artificial intelligence; blood level; concentration (parameter); consumer; dust exposure; environmental exposure; exposure science; household; human; indoor environment; population; priority journal; systematic review; adult; biological monitoring; child; dust; pollutant; United States; Adult; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Artificial Intelligence; Biological Monitoring; Child; Drinking Water; Dust; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Systematic Reviews as Topic,Elsevier Ltd
Biometric assessments of the posterior fossa by fetal MRI: A systematic review,"Mckinnon K., Kendall G.S., Tann C.J., Dyet L., Sokolska M., Baruteau K.P., Marlow N., Robertson N.J., Peebles D., Srinivasan L.",2021,Prenatal Diagnosis,"Background: Posterior fossa abnormalities (PFAs) are commonly identified within routine screening and are a frequent indication for fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although biometric measurements of the posterior fossa (PF) are established on fetal ultrasound and MRI, qualitative visual assessments are predominantly used to differentiate PFAs. Objectives: This systematic review aimed to assess 2-dimensional (2D) biometric measurements currently in use for assessing the PF on fetal MRI to delineate different PFAs. Methods: The protocol was registered (PROSPERO ID CRD42019142162). Eligible studies included T2-weighted MRI PF measurements in fetuses with and without PFAs, including measurements of the PF, or other brain areas relevant to PFAs. Results: 59 studies were included – 6859 fetuses had 62 2D PF and related measurements. These included linear, area and angular measurements, representing measures of PF size, cerebellum/vermis, brainstem, and supratentorial measurements. 11 measurements were used in 10 or more studies and at least 1200 fetuses. These dimensions were used to characterise normal for gestational age, diagnose a range of pathologies, and predict outcome. Conclusion: A selection of validated 2D biometric measurements of the PF on fetal MRI may be useful for identification of PFA in different clinical settings. Consistent use of these measures, both clinically and for research, is recommended. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"brain stem; cerebellum vermis; fetus; gestational age; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; posterior fossa; review; systematic review; biometry; cerebellum; diagnostic imaging; female; fetus echography; organ size; posterior fossa; pregnancy; Biometry; Brain Stem; Cerebellum; Cranial Fossa, Posterior; Female; Fetus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Organ Size; Pregnancy; Ultrasonography, Prenatal",John Wiley and Sons Ltd
Drinking water pollutants may affect the immune system: concerns regarding COVID-19 health effects,"Quinete N., Hauser-Davis R.A.",2021,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"The current coronavirus pandemic is leading to significant impacts on the planet, changing our way of life. Although the COVID-19 virus mechanisms of action and pathogenesis are still under extensive research, immune system effects are evident, leading, in many cases, to respiratory distress. Although apparent pollution reduction has been noticed by the population, environmental and human health impacts due to the increased use of plastic waste and disinfectants is concerning. One of the main routes of human exposure to pollutants is through drinking water. Thus, this point of view discusses some major contaminants in drinking water known to be immunotoxic, exploring sources and drinking water routes and emphasizing the known mechanisms of action that could likely compromise the effective immune response of humans, particularly raising concerns regarding people exposed to the COVID-19 virus. Based on a literature review, metals, plastic components, plasticizers, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances may display the potential to exacerbate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms, although epidemiological studies are still required to confirm the synergistic effects between these pollutants and the virus. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cytokines; Immune response; Metals; PFAS, plastic components and plasticizers; SARS-CoV-2",drinking water; health impact; immune response; immune system; pathogenicity; viral disease; water pollution; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Coronavirus infection; human; immune system; water pollutant; Coronavirus Infections; COVID-19; Humans; Immune System; SARS-CoV-2; Water Pollutants,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
"A review of the transplacental transfer of persistent halogenated organic pollutants: Transfer characteristics, influential factors, and mechanisms","Zhang X., Cheng X., Lei B., Zhang G., Bi Y., Yu Y.",2021,Environment International,"Persistent halogenated organic pollutants (HOPs) are a class of toxic chemicals, which may have adverse effects on fetuses via transplacental transfer from their mothers. Here, we review reported internal exposure levels of various HOPs (organochlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, short- and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) in placenta, and both maternal and umbilical cord sera. We also present analyses of the transplacental transfer and placental distribution characteristics of each class of compounds, and discuss effects of several factors on the transfer and accumulation efficiencies of HOPs, as well as the main mechanisms of HOPs’ transfer across the placental barrier. Reported compound-specific transplacental transfer efficiencies and distribution efficiencies, expressed as umbilical cord:maternal serum and placental:maternal serum concentration ratios (RCM and RPM, respectively), are summarized. Average published RCM values of the HOPs range from 0.24 to 3.08 (lipid-adjusted) and from 0.04 to 3.1 (based on wet weights), and are highest for perfluoroalkylcarboxylates (PFCAs) and tetrabromobisphenol A. Average published RPM values range from 0.14 to 1.02 (lipid-adjusted) and from 0.30 to 1.4 (based on wet weights). The broad RCM and RPM ranges may reflect effects of various factors, inter alia physicochemical properties of HOPs, metabolic capacities of mothers and fetuses, placental maturity, and differential expression of influx/efflux transporters in the placenta. Generally, HOPs’ RCM values decline linearly with molecular size, and are curvilinearly related to solubility. Plasma protein binding affinity and the difference between maternal and fetal metabolic capacities may also affect some HOPs’ transfer efficiencies. HOPs’ molecular size may be influential. Transplacental transport of HOPs likely occurs mostly through passive diffusion, although influx/efflux transporters expressed on maternal and/or fetal sides of the placenta may also facilitate or hinder their transport. Overall, the review highlights clear gaps in our understanding of mechanisms involved in HOPs’ transplacental transport. © 2020 The Author(s)",Halogenated persistent organic pollutants; Physicochemical properties; Solubility; Transfer mechanisms; Transfer ratio; Transplacental transfer,Binding energy; Biochemistry; Efficiency; Halogenation; Metabolism; Organic chemicals; Physicochemical properties; Distribution characteristics; Distribution efficiency; Medium-chain chlorinated paraffins; Organochlorinated pesticides; Plasma protein binding; Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Transfer characteristics; Transplacental transfers; Organic pollutants; organochlorine pesticide; paraffin; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkylcarboxylate; plasma protein; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; tetrabromobisphenol A; unclassified drug; diphenyl ether derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; halogen; health impact; metabolism; persistent organic pollutant; physicochemical property; plasma; pollution exposure; serum; solubility; active transport; anthropometric parameters; binding affinity; bioaccumulation; halogenated organic pollutant; human; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; isomer; maternal blood; metabolic capacity; molecular size; passive transport; persistent organic pollutant; physical chemistry; placenta; placental transfer; pollution transport; prenatal exposure; priority journal; protein expression; Review; risk factor; solubility; systematic review; transport kinetics; umbilical cord blood; chemistry; female; fetomaternal transfusion; pollutant; pregnancy; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Persistent Organic Pollutants; Placenta; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Pregnancy,Elsevier Ltd
A systematic review and ecological risk assessment for organic ultraviolet filters in aquatic environments,"Carve M., Nugegoda D., Allinson G., Shimeta J.",2021,Environmental Pollution,"Organic ultraviolet filters (OUVFs) are used in a wide range of manufactured products including personal care (e.g. sunscreens) and plastic items. This review summarizes the available data regarding the toxic effects of OUVFs on marine and freshwater organisms and generates the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) values necessary for assessing ecological risk. Through a systematic search of the literature, 89 studies were identified and ecotoxicological data extracted. Collectively, these studies described toxicity testing with 39 OUVF from 10 structural classes, with derivatives of benzophenones (49%) and camphors (16%) most studied. There was a bias towards selecting freshwater species (61%), and evaluating single OUVF effects (87%) rather than OUVF mixtures. Short-term (acute) experimentation (58%) was marginally more common than long-term (chronic) testing (42%). Reproductive, developmental, genetic, and neurological toxicity were the most commonly identified effects in aquatic organism, and were associated with molecular interactions with steroid receptors, DNA, or the production of reactive oxygen species. Species sensitivity distribution and/or assessment factors were used to calculate PNECs for 22 OUVFs and the risk quotients for 12 OUVFs. When using maximum concentrations, high risk was observed for six OUVFs in marine environments (4-methylbenzylidene-camphor, octocrylene, padimate-O, benzophenone-1, and oxybenzone, ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate), and for four OUVFs in freshwater environments (ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, avobenzone and oxybenzone). When using median concentrations, a risk to marine environments was observed for oxybenzone. The results of this review underline that there is limited knowledge of the pathological effects of OUVFs and their metabolites in aquatic environments, and this inhibits the development of informed water-quality guidelines. © 2020 Elsevier LtdOUVF research has focused on effects in freshwater more than marine organisms, yet evidence indicates OUVFs pose a risk to both; but current knowledge gaps inhibit the development of informed water-quality guidelines. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Emerging pollutant; Predicted no effect concentration (PNEC); Taxonomic trends; Toxicity; Ultraviolet light stabilizer; UV filter,"Aquatic organisms; Ecology; Marine biology; Metabolites; Molecular oxygen; Plastic products; Plastics industry; Polypropylenes; Search engines; Toxicity; Water quality; Ecological risk assessment; Freshwater environments; Manufactured products; Maximum concentrations; Median concentration; Predicted no-effect concentrations; Species sensitivity distributions; Water quality guidelines; Risk assessment; 3 (4 methylbenzylidene)camphor; 4 methoxycinnamic acid 2 ethylhexyl ester; avobenzone; benzophenone; benzophenone 1; camphor; chemical agent; octocrylene; organic ultraviolet filter; oxybenzone; padimate; reactive oxygen metabolite; steroid receptor; unclassified drug; fresh water; sunscreen; aquatic environment; concentration (composition); DNA; ecotoxicology; freshwater ecosystem; gene expression; reactive oxygen species; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; taxonomy; toxicity; water quality; aquatic environment; chemical analysis; concentration (parameter); developmental toxicity; DNA determination; ecotoxicity; genotoxicity; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; physical chemistry; physical parameters; reproductive toxicity; Review; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; water quality; analysis; aquatic species; risk assessment; toxicity; water pollutant; Dryobalanops; Aquatic Organisms; Fresh Water; Risk Assessment; Sunscreening Agents; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier Ltd
Development of Proteomic Prediction Models for Transition to Psychotic Disorder in the Clinical High-Risk State and Psychotic Experiences in Adolescence,"Mongan D., Föcking M., Healy C., Susai S.R., Heurich M., Wynne K., Nelson B., McGorry P.D., Amminger G.P., Nordentoft M., Krebs M.-O., Riecher-Rössler A., Bressan R.A., Barrantes-Vidal N., Borgwardt S., Ruhrmann S., Sachs G., Pantelis C., Van Der Gaag M., De Haan L., Valmaggia L., Pollak T.A., Kempton M.J., Rutten B.P.F., Whelan R., Cannon M., Zammit S., Cagney G., Cotter D.R., McGuire P.",2021,JAMA Psychiatry,"Importance: Biomarkers that are predictive of outcomes in individuals at risk of psychosis would facilitate individualized prognosis and stratification strategies. Objective: To investigate whether proteomic biomarkers may aid prediction of transition to psychotic disorder in the clinical high-risk (CHR) state and adolescent psychotic experiences (PEs) in the general population. Design, Setting, and Participants: This diagnostic study comprised 2 case-control studies nested within the European Network of National Schizophrenia Networks Studying Gene-Environment Interactions (EU-GEI) and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). EU-GEI is an international multisite prospective study of participants at CHR referred from local mental health services. ALSPAC is a United Kingdom-based general population birth cohort. Included were EU-GEI participants who met CHR criteria at baseline and ALSPAC participants who did not report PEs at age 12 years. Data were analyzed from September 2018 to April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: In EU-GEI, transition status was assessed by the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States or contact with clinical services. In ALSPAC, PEs at age 18 years were assessed using the Psychosis-Like Symptoms Interview. Proteomic data were obtained from mass spectrometry of baseline plasma samples in EU-GEI and plasma samples at age 12 years in ALSPAC. Support vector machine learning algorithms were used to develop predictive models. Results: The EU-GEI subsample (133 participants at CHR (mean [SD] age, 22.6 [4.5] years; 68 [51.1%] male) comprised 49 (36.8%) who developed psychosis and 84 (63.2%) who did not. A model based on baseline clinical and proteomic data demonstrated excellent performance for prediction of transition outcome (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.95; positive predictive value [PPV], 75.0%; and negative predictive value [NPV], 98.6%). Functional analysis of differentially expressed proteins implicated the complement and coagulation cascade. A model based on the 10 most predictive proteins accurately predicted transition status in training (AUC, 0.99; PPV, 76.9%; and NPV, 100%) and test (AUC, 0.92; PPV, 81.8%; and NPV, 96.8%) data. The ALSPAC subsample (121 participants from the general population with plasma samples available at age 12 years (61 [50.4%] male) comprised 55 participants (45.5%) with PEs at age 18 years and 61 (50.4%) without PEs at age 18 years. A model using proteomic data at age 12 years predicted PEs at age 18 years, with an AUC of 0.74 (PPV, 67.8%; and NPV, 75.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: In individuals at risk of psychosis, proteomic biomarkers may contribute to individualized prognosis and stratification strategies. These findings implicate early dysregulation of the complement and coagulation cascade in the development of psychosis outcomes. © 2021 American Medical Association.

Interlocking intramedullary nail for proximal femur versus proximal femoral anti-rotation intramedullary nail or proximal femoral anti-rotation intramedullary nail of asian for intertrochanteric fractures in older adults: A meta-analysis,"Chang L., Shufeng H.",2021,Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research,"OBJECTIVE: The most commonly used intramedullary fixation systems for the treatment of elderly intertrochanteric fractures include the proximal femoral anti-rotation intramedullary nail (PFNA), the proximal femoral anti-rotation intramedullary nail of Asian (PFNA-II) and interlocking intramedullary nail for proximal femur (Inter-TAN), but the clinical effect of the three in the treatment of A2 and A3 type intertrochanteric fractures is still controversial. Meta-analysis was used to compare the clinical efficacy of Inter-TAN, PFNA, and PFNA-II in the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly. METHODS: A computer was used to search databases such as Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Sinomed, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP to collect and compare the literatures of Inter-TAN, PFNA, and PFNA-II in the treatment of elderly unstable intertrochanteric fractures. The search period was from the establishment of the database to December 2019. Two reviewers independently read the screening literature, extracted data and evaluated the quality. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.3 software. RESULTS: (1) A total of eight studies were included, with 1 349 patients, including two randomized controlled studies and six cohort studies. The evidence level was ≥ III. (2) Meta-analysis showed that the operation time and intraoperative fluoroscopy time were longer, and intraoperative blood loss was more in the Inter-TAN group than those of the PFNA-II group [MD=-16.60, 95%CI (-23.22,-9.99), P <0.05; MD=-1.85, 95%CI (-2.53,-1.16), P <0.05; MD=-9.83, 95%CI (-12.66,-6.99), P <0.000 01], with no significant difference compared with PFNA group (P >0.05). There was no significant difference in tip-apex distance, length of hospital stay, and Harris score of Inter-TAN group compared with PFNA group and PFNA-II group (P > 0.05). The incidence of postoperative screw cut-out in the Inter-TAN group was less than in the PFNA group and the PFNA-II group [OR=6.47, 95%CI(2.79, 15.00), P < 0.05; OR=5.88, 95%CI(1.29, 26.69), P <0.05]. The incidence of hip or thigh pain in the Inter-TAN group was less than that in the PFNA group and the PFNA-II group [OR=2.57, 95%CI(1.19, 5.52), P < 0.05; OR=3.20, 95%CI(-1.56, 6.55), P <0.05]. Postoperative femoral shaft fractures in the Inter-TAN group were less than those in the PFNA group and PFNA-II group [OR=3.87, 95%CI(1.75, 8.57), P <0.05; OR=7.06, 95%CI(1.24, 40.07), P <0.05]. The incidence of postoperative secondary surgery in the Inter-TAN group was less than in the PFNA group [OR=4.10, 95%CI(2.45, 6.86), P <0.05], and there was no significant difference compared with PFNA-II group (P >0.05). CONCLUSION: For patients with osteoporosis and poor stability, Inter-TAN can provide better stability and reduce postoperative complications. For patients with poor general conditions and greater surgical risk, PFNA-II internal fixation can be selected. © 2021, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

"Uptake, accumulation and metabolism of PFASs in plants and health perspectives: A critical review","Jiao X., Shi Q., Gan J.",2021,Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are man-made persistent organic compounds of significant health and environmental concern because of their resistance to degradation, tendency for global transport, and ability to bioaccumulate. The widespread use and stability of PFASs provide many opportunities for human exposure to these contaminants. In recent years, our understanding of PFASs as contaminants in vegetation has increased considerably. PFASs are taken up, transformed and accumulated in various compartments of plants, and the rate of these processes depends on environmental conditions, compound-specific characteristics, plant species, and other competing factors. This review summarizes the recent findings on the uptake, accumulation, distribution and metabolism of PFASs in higher plants, with a specific focus on plant metabolism pathways of representative polyfluoroalkyl compounds. The potential risk of PFASs in plant-origin food for human exposure is also discussed. Further studies on plant metabolism of polyfluoroalkyl chemicals are in urgent need to fill the data gaps and allow a comprehensive understanding of plant metabolism pathways. Additional research questions are proposed, including the behavior and fate of new PFASs and PFOS/PFOA replacements in environmental systems in the presence of plants, and the phytoremediation potential of different plant species. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",PFAS; plant metabolism; plant uptake,Bioremediation; Environmental concerns; Environmental conditions; Environmental systems; Persistent organic compounds; Phytoremediation potentials; Polyfluoroalkyl compounds; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Research questions; Metabolism; alcohol derivative; alkyl group; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctane; perfluorooctanoic acid; phosphate; sulfonamide; sulfone derivative; accumulation; metabolism; phytoremediation; research; risk; vegetation; bioaccumulation; biotransformation; degradation; environmental exposure; health hazard; human; nonhuman; phytoremediation; plant leaf; plant metabolism; plant root; Review; risk assessment; vascular plant; vegetation; Embryophyta,Taylor and Francis Ltd.
“Drop-in” fuel production from biomass: Critical review on techno-economic feasibility and sustainability,"Kargbo H., Harris J.S., Phan A.N.",2021,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,"This paper reviews the technological and economical feasibilities as well as sustainable assessment of approaches (thermochemical and biochemical) applied for sustainable “drop-in” fuel production from lignocellulosic sources. The challenges for each pathway to produce “drop-in” fuels are covered. Currently “drop-in” fuel production cost is approximately 2 times (~5–6$/gallon) higher than fossil fuels (3$/gallon), especially with the use of 2nd generation feedstocks. The primary sources of cost with “drop-in” fuel production are feedstock cost (40–60% of the total production cost), syngas cleaning and conditioning to meet Fischer-Tropsch synthesis requirement (12–15% of the total production cost) and bio oil upgrading (14–18% of the total production cost) in the case of pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The most influential factors on the life cycle analysis (LCA) were biomass cultivation, harvesting, biomass pre-treatment, and transportation. Therefore, robust processes that can use local waste biomass are far more environmental and economically viable, especially as biofuel from second generation have a greater potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (50–100%) than first generation biofuels (50–90%) when land use changes are omitted in the LCA. The sustainability of biofuels is pre-dominantly dependant on the sustainability of the initial biomass, with 2nd generation feedstocks being more sustainable than 1st generation. Gasification-FTS is considered as the most promising technique for “drop-in” fuel production over pyrolysis and HTL due to its flexibility towards feedstock acceptance and the ability to produced high yields of liquid fuel together with other economically viable biofuels such as electricity and heat. Biochemical routes (i.e.fermentation) to “drop-in” fuels are still in their early development stages, and therefore require more studies and pilot-scale experiments in order to discover an economic and sustainable means of using these methods. © 2020",Biomass; Conversion technologies; Life cycle assessment; Techno-economic analysis; “Drop-in” fuels,Biomass; Costs; Drops; Economics; Feedstocks; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrothermal synthesis; Land use; Life cycle; Lignocellulosic biomass; Pyrolysis; Sustainable development; Synthesis gas manufacture; Biomass pre treatments; Economical feasibility; Economically viable; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Pilot-scale experiments; Sustainable assessment; Techno-economic feasibility; Total production cost; Biofuels,Elsevier Ltd
Nexus between perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) and human thyroid dysfunction: A systematic review evidenced from laboratory investigations and epidemiological studies,"Xie W., Zhong W., Appenzeller B.M.R., Zhang J., Junaid M., Xu N.",2021,Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology,"Perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) have attracted massive attention in recent years for their endocrine-disrupting potential. This review summarizes the underlying evidence on the primary fate and in vitro/vivo toxic effects of PFCs and their interactions and relationships with thyroid dysfunction and cancer induction in exposed groups, including the general population, occupationally exposed groups, highly exposed individuals, and prone subjects (pregnant women and neonates). The potential endocrine-disrupting mechanism of PFCs may include multiple processes of thyroid malfunction or hormonal imbalance. The increased level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was observed as the most consistent outcome of PFC exposure among generally exposed populations. Specifically, the levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and TSH were significantly correlated among pregnant women. In some instances, the maternal PFC level was negatively correlated with the neonatal thyroxine (T4) level in serum. The PFCs and thyroid malfunction or thyroid hormone (TH) levels also revealed a potential association among the population under high-level environmental exposure, albeit not always following a strict exposure-response relationship. Moreover, occupational exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) showed a probable link with TH (excluding TSH) alterations in serum. Importantly, no concrete and statistically significant evidence highlighted the risk of thyroid cancer in humans exposed to PFCs. Highlights The first robust review describing the effects of PFCs on thyroid dysfunctions. PFC exposure induces sex- and age-specific responses in the human thyroid system. Serum PFOS exposure is positively correlated with TSH in pregnant women. Maternal serum PFC levels are negatively correlated with the neonate’s T4 levels. No statistical evidence supported a concrete association between PFCs and thyroid cancer. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs); Perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs); thyroid disruption,Diseases; Environmental exposure; Epidemiological studies; Exposure-response relationships; Laboratory investigations; Occupational exposure; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Thyroid stimulating hormones; Endocrine disrupters; alkyl group; perfluoroalkyl derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; thyroid hormone; thyrotropin; thyroxine; unclassified drug; cancer; chemical compound; endocrine system disorder; epidemiology; laboratory method; literature review; occupational exposure; serum; Article; environmental exposure; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; maternal serum; nonhuman; occupational exposure; pregnant woman; protein expression; systematic review; thyroid disease,Taylor and Francis Ltd.
Transcriptional regulation of organohalide pollutant utilisation in bacteria,"Maucourt B., Vuilleumier S., Bringel F.",2021,FEMS Microbiology Reviews,"Organohalides are organic molecules formed biotically and abiotically, both naturally and through industrial production. They are usually toxic and represent a health risk for living organisms, including humans. Bacteria capable of degrading organohalides for growth express dehalogenase genes encoding enzymes that cleave carbon-halogen bonds. Such bacteria are of potential high interest for bioremediation of contaminated sites. Dehalogenase genes are often part of gene clusters that may include regulators, accessory genes and genes for transporters and other enzymes of organohalide degradation pathways. Organohalides and their degradation products affect the activity of regulatory factors, and extensive genome-wide modulation of gene expression helps dehalogenating bacteria to cope with stresses associated with dehalogenation, such as intracellular increase of halides, dehalogenase-dependent acid production, organohalide toxicity and misrouting and bottlenecks in metabolic fluxes. This review focuses on transcriptional regulation of gene clusters for dehalogenation in bacteria, as studied in laboratory experiments and in situ. The diversity in gene content, organization and regulation of such gene clusters is highlighted for representative organohalide-degrading bacteria. Selected examples illustrate a key, overlooked role of regulatory processes, often strain-specific, for efficient dehalogenation and productive growth in presence of organohalides. © FEMS 2020.

Vibration-based structural monitoring of bi-clamped metal-composite bonded joint: Experimental and numerical analyses,"Medeiros R., Souza G.S.C., Marques D.E.T., Flor F.R., Tita V.",2021,Journal of Adhesion,"The present study verifies the applicability of vibration-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) to identify debonding in bi-clamped metal-composite bonded joints, which can be applied in aeronautical structures. The method compares the Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) of the case studies with and without debonding damage. This analysis is done mainly through metrics of damage detection based on a comparison between the magnitude and phase angles of FRFs. The same metrics were also used after the application of a data filtering process. The specimens were manufactured from carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers and titanium and were joined by epoxy resin. Half of the specimens have a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) attached to the titanium adherent. The debonding damage was simulated for the damaged specimens by having 50% of the overlap area covered by a layer of Teflon. Three case studies have been reported: first, it verifies the influence of the PZT on FRFs; second, it evaluates the influence of the debonding damage by using accelerometers, and third, it performs the damage detection analysis by using the electrical responses of the PZT. Numerical and experimental analyses are compared, evaluating limitations and potentialities of the computational models. The results support the applicability of the metrics for damage quantification. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Aeronautical application; Damage detection; Finite element analysis; Metal-composite bonded joints; Vibration mechanics; Vibration-based method,Adhesive joints; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Damage detection; Debonding; Epoxy resins; Finite element method; Frequency response; Metal analysis; Structural health monitoring; Titanium; Aeronautical applications; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer; Experimental and numerical analysis; Metal composites; Numerical and experimental analysis; Vibration mechanics; Vibration-based method; Vibration-based structural health monitoring; Vibration analysis; Damage; Debonding; Detection; Monitoring; Polyepoxides; Samples; Titanium; Vibration Analysis,"Bellwether Publishing, Ltd."
"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in soil and sediments: Occurrence, fate, remediation and future outlook","Ahmed M.B., Johir M.A.H., McLaughlan R., Nguyen L.N., Xu B., Nghiem L.D.",2020,Science of the Total Environment,"Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are contaminants of great concern due to their wide-spread occurrence and persistence in the environments (i.e., in water, soil and sediment) and potential toxicology even at very low concentration. The main focus of this review is on the PFASs in soil and sediments. More specifically, this review systematically examines the occurrence and toxicological effects with associated risks, fate (i.e., PFASs adsorption by soil and sediment, transportation and transformation, and bioaccumulation), and remediation practices of PFASs in soil and sediment. Various models and equations such as fugacity-based multimedia fate and hydrodynamic models are used to study the fate, transport, and transformation of PFASs. Among different remediation practices, sorption is the dominant process for the removal of PFASs from soil and sediments. Results also indicate that PFASs adsorption onto activated carbon decrease with the increase of carbon chain length in the PFASs. The longer-chain PFASs have larger partition coefficient values than shorter-chained PFASs. Sorption of PFASs to soil and sediments are mainly governed by different electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds formation, hydrophobic interactions, organic content in soil and sediments, and ligand exchange. Other technology such as thermal treatment might be potential in the removal of PAFSs, but need further study to elucidate a conclusion. Finally, the associated challenges and future outlook have been included. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Occurrence; PFASs; Remediation; Soil and sediments; Sorption,Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Biochemistry; Hydrogen bonds; Hydrophobicity; Sediments; Soils; Carbon-chain length; Hydrodynamic model; Hydrophobic interactions; Low concentrations; Partition coefficient; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Soil and sediment; Toxicological effects; Soil pollution; activated carbon; chemical compound; ligand; organic carbon; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; activated carbon; environmental fate; organic pollutant; organohalogen; pollutant removal; remediation; sediment pollution; soil pollution; toxicology; adsorption; Article; bioaccumulation; biotransformation; ecosystem restoration; electrodialysis; human; hydrodynamics; hydrogen bond; hydrophobicity; nonhuman; priority journal; risk assessment; sediment; soil; soil pollutant; static electricity; traffic and transport,Elsevier B.V.
Nanomaterial-based fluorescent biosensors for monitoring environmental pollutants: A critical review,"Gaviria-Arroyave M.I., Cano J.B., Peñuela G.A.",2020,Talanta Open,"The growing interest in nanomaterials with advanced optoelectronic properties has promoted the advancement of biosensors with various applications. In the environmental field, the need for rapid detection of pollutants in water sources has opened the door to fluorescent biosensors. These systems are quite sensitive and simple. Nanomaterials such as carbon dots (CD), quantum dots (QD), gold nanoparticles, nanoclusters, graphene (G), graphene oxide (GO), transition metal dialcogens (TMDC) and organometallic frameworks (MOF), have been used in the development of fluorescent detection systems. They are usually based on the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) quenching principle. Nanomaterials can be bioconjugated with molecules such as antibodies, enzymes or aptamers, to achieve specific detection of the target pollutant, even in real samples. This review conducts a critical analysis of the operating principle of different nanomaterial-based fluorescent biosensors. We discuss the detection of substances of high concern like heavy metals, pesticides, and so-called emerging contaminants. The advantages and disadvantages of the methods are discussed, as well as recommendations for future approaches and a possible massification of these systems. © 2020 The Authors",Bioconjugation; Emerging pollutants; FRET; Heavy metals; Nanostructures; Pesticides,,Elsevier B.V.
Metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis of mcf-7 cells exposed to 23 chemicals at human-relevant levels: Estimation of individual chemical contribution to effects,"Liu M., Jia S., Dong T., Zhao F., Xu T., Yang Q., Gong J., Fang M.",2020,Environmental Health Perspectives,"BACKGROUND: Humans are constantly being exposed to various xenobiotics at relatively low concentrations. To date, limited evidence is available to ascertain whether a complex xenobiotic mixture at human-relevant levels causes any health effect. Moreover, there is no effective method to pinpoint the contribution of each chemical toward such an effect. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to understand the responses of cells to a mixture containing 23 xenobiotics at human-relevant levels and develop a fea-sible method to decipher the chemical(s) that contribute significantly to the observed effect. METHODS: We characterized the metabolome and transcriptome of breast cancer cells (MCF-7) before and after exposure to the mixture at human-relevant levels; preexposure levels were derived from existing large-scale biomonitoring data. A high-throughput metabolomics-based “leave-one-out” method was proposed to understand the relative contribution of each component by comparing the metabolome with and without the particular chemical in the mixture. RESULTS: The metabolomic analysis suggested that the mixture altered metabolites associated with cell proliferation and oxidative stress. For the tran-scriptomes, gene ontology terms and pathways including “cell cycle,” “cell proliferation,” and “cell division” were significantly altered after mixture exposure. The mixture altered genes associated with pathways such as “genotoxicity” and “nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2).” Through joint pathways analysis, metabolites and genes were observed to be well-aligned in pyrimidine and purine metabolisms. The leave-one-out results showed that many chemicals made their contributions to specific metabolic pathways. The overall metabolome pattern of the absence of 2,4-dihyroxybenzophenone (DHB) or bisphenol A (BPA) showed great resemblance to controls, suggesting their higher relative contribution to the observed effect. DISCUSSION: The omics results showed that exposure to the mixture at human-relevant levels can induce significant in vitro cellular changes. Also, the leave one out method offers an effective approach for deconvoluting the effects of the mixture. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

"Impurities in biogas: Analytical strategies, occurrence, effects and removal technologies","Bragança I., Sánchez-Soberón F., Pantuzza G.F., Alves A., Ratola N.",2020,Biomass and Bioenergy,"The growing concerns on the sustainability of our planet have been leading the way to the development of alternative and renewable forms of energy. One example is the use of waste (e.g. sewage sludge, forest residues, agroindustry and food processing) to produce biogas. Comprised mostly of methane and carbon dioxide, it can be used as fuel in cogeneration systems, automotive mobility and domestic heating, among other applications. The increasing interest in the use of biogas has raised some questions regarding its quality for energy valorization. To start, the carbon dioxide content must be adjusted to upgrade the calorific power and economic value and then common potentially hazardous and even toxic impurities such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfur, halogens, or ammonia should be removed to ensure a correct operation. Recently, a close attention was drawn to the presence of siloxanes. These widespread emerging pollutants compromise the use of biogas for energy production due to the formation of abrasive silicon oxides after combustion that deposit on and damage several engine parts. In addition, some of them are potentially toxic and persistent, involving a threat to humans and the environment, which increased drastically the literature devoted to them in the last years. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of the literature available on biogas impurities, presenting their main effects, sampling and analytical strategies, and concentrations. A summary of removal methodologies is also presented to address the technological challenges to cope with these unwanted compounds. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Ammonia; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Halogenated compounds; Hydrogen sulfide; Siloxanes,Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Carbon monoxide; Food processing; Hydrodesulfurization; Removal; Sewage sludge; Silicon compounds; Silicon oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Sustainable development; Waste incineration; Analytical strategy; Cogeneration systems; Comprehensive assessment; Domestic heating; Emerging pollutants; Energy productions; Technological challenges; Toxic impurities; Biogas; agroindustry; ammonia; analytical method; biogas; carbon dioxide; cogeneration; combustion; sampling; sustainability; waste,Elsevier Ltd
Genomic and resistance epidemiology of gram-negative bacteria in Africa: A systematic review and phylogenomic analyses from a one health perspective,"Sekyere J.O., Reta M.A.",2020,mSystems,"Antibiotic resistance (AR) remains a major threat to public and animal health globally. However, AR ramifications in developing countries are worsened by limited molecular diagnostics, expensive therapeutics, inadequate numbers of skilled clinicians and scientists, and unsanitary environments. The epidemiology of Gram-negative bacteria, their AR genes, and geographical distribution in Africa are described here. Data were extracted and analyzed from English-language articles published between 2015 and December 2019. The genomes and AR genes of the various species, obtained from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) and NCBI were analyzed phylogenetically using Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood (RAxML) and annotated with Figtree. The geographic location of resistant clones/clades was mapped manually. Thirty species from 31 countries and 24 genera from 41 countries were analyzed from 146 articles and 3,028 genomes, respectively. Genes mediating resistance to β-lactams (including blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M, blaNDM, blaIMP, blaVIM, and blaOXA-48/181), fluoroquinolones (oqxAB, qnrA/B/ D/S, gyrA/B, and parCE mutations, etc.), aminoglycosides (including armA and rmtC/ F), sulfonamides (sul1/2/3), trimethoprim (dfrA), tetracycline [tet(A/B/C/D/G/O/M/39)], colistin (mcr-1), phenicols (catA/B, cmlA), and fosfomycin (fosA) were mostly found in Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and also in Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter baumannii, etc., on mostly IncF-type, IncX3/4, ColRNAI, and IncR plasmids, within IntI1 gene cassettes, insertion sequences, and transposons. Clonal and multiclonal outbreaks and dissemination of resistance genes across species and countries and between humans, animals, plants, and the environment were observed; Escherichia coli ST103, K. pneumoniae ST101, S. enterica ST1/2, and Vibrio cholerae ST69/515 were common strains. Most pathogens were of human origin, and zoonotic transmissions were relatively limited. IMPORTANCE Antibiotic resistance (AR) is one of the major public health threats and challenges to effective containment and treatment of infectious bacterial diseases worldwide. Here, we used different methods to map out the geographical hot spots, sources, and evolutionary epidemiology of AR. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., Neisseria meningitis/gonorrhoeae, Vibrio cholerae, Campylobacter jejuni, etc., were common pathogens shuttling AR genes in Africa. Transmission of the same clones/strains across countries and between animals, humans, plants, and the environment was observed. We recommend Enterobacter spp. or K. pneumoniae as better sentinel species for AR surveillance. Copyright © 2020 Osei Sekyere and Reta.

Does patellofemoral osteoarthritis affect functional outcomes and survivorship after medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty? A meta-analysis,"Lu F., Yan Y., Wang W., Zhang Q., Guo W.",2020,Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research,"Purpose: The argument that patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) is a contraindication to unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) remains to be resolved. The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to determine whether PFOA affects functional outcomes and survivorship after medial UKA. Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library and Web of science to identify studies published in English (the last search was updated on June 1, 2020). The primary outcome measure was the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), whereas the secondary outcomes included range of motion (ROM) and the revision rate. Patients with patellofemoral joint narrowing or cartilage lesions as assessed intraoperatively or by radiography were assigned to the PFOA group. Results: A total of 8 studies involving 3504 patients and 3975 knees were included in this meta-analysis. No patients had a severe lateral patellar groove. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the OKS, revision rate and ROM between PFOA patients and patients without PFOA. Conclusions: No significant difference in functional outcomes and survivorship was found between patients with and without PFOA. Patients with PFOA assessed by radiographs or intraoperatively but without a lateral patellar groove should be considered candidates for medial UKA. © 2020, The Author(s).",Meta-analysis; Patellofemoral osteoarthritis; UKA,"aged; convalescence; female; human; knee osteoarthritis; knee replacement; male; meta analysis; middle aged; mortality; patellofemoral joint; pathophysiology; procedures; survival rate; treatment outcome; Aged; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Patellofemoral Joint; Recovery of Function; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome",BioMed Central Ltd
"Environmental chemicals, breast cancer progression and drug resistance","Koual M., Tomkiewicz C., Cano-Sancho G., Antignac J.-P., Bats A.-S., Coumoul X.",2020,Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source,"Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common causes of cancer in the world and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Mortality is associated mainly with the development of metastases. Identification of the mechanisms involved in metastasis formation is, therefore, a major public health issue. Among the proposed risk factors, chemical environment and pollution are increasingly suggested to have an effect on the signaling pathways involved in metastatic tumor cells emergence and progression. The purpose of this article is to summarize current knowledge about the role of environmental chemicals in breast cancer progression, metastasis formation and resistance to chemotherapy. Through a scoping review, we highlight the effects of a wide variety of environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants and endocrine disruptors, on invasion mechanisms and metastatic processes in BC. We identified the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer-stemness (the stem cell-like phenotype in tumors), two mechanisms suspected of playing key roles in the development of metastases and linked to chemoresistance, as potential targets of contaminants. We discuss then the recently described pro-migratory and pro-invasive Ah receptor signaling pathway and conclude that his role in BC progression is still controversial. In conclusion, although several pertinent pathways for the effects of xenobiotics have been identified, the mechanisms of actions for multiple other molecules remain to be established. The integral role of xenobiotics in the exposome in BC needs to be further explored through additional relevant epidemiological studies that can be extended to molecular mechanisms. © 2020, The Author(s).",Breast cancer; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Environmental exposure; Environmental pollutants; aryl hydrocarbon receptor; cancer stem cells; drug resistance; Organochlorine pesticides; Perfluoroalkyl acid; Polychlorinated biphenyls,"1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 2 amino 1 methyl 6 phenylimidazo[4,5 b]pyridine; 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; 7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene; alcohol; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; arsenic; benzophenone; benzo[a]pyrene; cadmium; chlorphenotane; chromium; cigarette smoke; environmental chemical; hexachlorobenzene; nickel; nonylphenol; organochlorine pesticide; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; phthalic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; tungsten; biological development; cancer; drug resistance; emergence; mortality; phenotype; public health; xenobiotics; breast cancer; cancer growth; cancer stem cell; carcinogenicity; drug resistance; environmental exposure; environmental health; epithelial mesenchymal transition; human; metastasis; nonhuman; persistent organic pollutant; priority journal; Review; risk factor; systematic review; animal; breast tumor; disease exacerbation; female; pathology; pollutant; toxicity; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Disease Progression; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans",BioMed Central Ltd
Comparison of clinical outcomes with proximal femoral nail anti-rotation versus InterTAN nail for intertrochanteric femoral fractures: a meta-analysis,"Liu W., Liu J., Ji G.",2020,Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research,"Background: A meta-analysis to access the pros and cons of proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA) versus InterTAN nail for intertrochanteric femoral fractures including available evidence extracted from literature. Methods: According to the Cochrane systemic analysis method, randomized control trials (RCTs) and retrospective comparative observational studies which were related to the comparison of PFNA and InterTAN nail in the treatment of the elderly with intertrochanteric fractures were retrieved. Data were independently extracted from the included studies by two reviewers and analyzed using RevMan 5.3, and the quality of the studies was assessed. Results: Two RCTs and seven observational studies were recruited, which consisted of 681 patients with PFNA and 651 patients with InterTAN nail. The meta-analyses showed no significant differences between the two approaches on Harris Hip Score, operation time, blood loss, time to union, mean hospital stay, union problems, intraoperative complications, hematoma, infection, and other complications in both RCTs and observational studies. In terms of other outcomes, for the RCTs, results showed that there were shorter tip–apex distance and reduced pain at thigh or hip in InterTAN nail than in PFNA; however, InterTAN nail was not superior to PFNA in cutout, reoperation, and femoral shaft fracture; for observational studies, the risk of the screw migration (RR = 5.13, 95%CI [1.33,19.75], P = 0.02), cutout (RR = 3.26, 95%CI [1.64,6.47], P = 0.0008), the varus collapse of the femoral head (RR = 7.19, 95%CI [2.18,23.76], P = 0.001), femoral shaft fracture (RR = 5.73, 95%CI [2.24,14.65], P = 0.0003) treated by InterTAN nail were significantly decreased, compared with those by PFNA; however, no significant differences were observed in the aspects of tip–apex distance and pain at thigh or hip between these two groups. Conclusion: Analysis of a large number of relevant clinical indicators available shows that InterTAN nail has better clinical manifestation than PFNA in treating unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures. © 2020, The Author(s).",InterTAN nail; Meta-analysis; Proximal femoral nail anti-rotation; Unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures,"aged; bone nail; comparative study; female; femur fracture; human; length of stay; male; meta analysis; middle aged; observational study; operation duration; operative blood loss; osteosynthesis; peroperative complication; postoperative pain; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); rotation; treatment outcome; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Blood Loss, Surgical; Bone Nails; Female; Femoral Fractures; Fracture Fixation, Internal; Humans; Intraoperative Complications; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Observational Studies as Topic; Operative Time; Pain, Postoperative; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rotation; Treatment Outcome",BioMed Central Ltd
A critical review of antibiotic removal strategies: Performance and mechanisms,"Lu Z.-Y., Ma Y.-L., Zhang J.-T., Fan N.-S., Huang B.-C., Jin R.-C.",2020,Journal of Water Process Engineering,"Environmental pollution by antibiotics has severely affected human health and development. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have also been recognized as emerging pollutants because of their persistence and adverse impacts in aquatic ecosystems, even at low concentrations. For the alleviation and elimination of antibiotics stress, several approaches have been proposed, some of which have been applied in practice. This review systematically summarizes the removal strategies for various antibiotics and their corresponding mechanisms, including chemical, physical, biological, condition-based and combined strategies. Moreover, a comparison among these methods is made with a focus on the performance and efficiency. Further research needs are also proposed, which provides a guidance for the establishment of a control strategy to achieve simultaneous removal of nitrogen, antibiotics and ARGs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Antibiotics; ARGs; Mechanism; Removal strategy,,Elsevier Ltd
Review: Evolution of evidence on PFOA and health following the assessments of the C8 Science Panel,"Steenland K., Fletcher T., Stein C.R., Bartell S.M., Darrow L., Lopez-Espinosa M.-J., Barry Ryan P., Savitz D.A.",2020,Environment International,"Background: The C8 Science Panel was composed of three epidemiologists charged with studying the possible health effects of PFOA in a highly exposed population in the mid-Ohio Valley. The Panel determined in 2012 there was a ‘probable link’ (i.e., more probable than not based on the weight of the available scientific evidence) between PFOA and high cholesterol, thyroid disease, kidney and testicular cancer, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. Objective: Here, former C8 Science Panel members and collaborators comment on the PFOA literature regarding thyroid disorders, cancer, immune and auto-immune disorders, liver disease, hypercholesterolemia, reproductive outcomes, neurotoxicity, and kidney disease. We also discuss developments regarding fate and transport, and pharmacokinetic models, and discuss causality assessment in cross-sectional associations among low-exposed populations. Discussion: For cancer, the epidemiologic evidence remains supportive but not definitive for kidney and testicular cancers. There is consistent evidence of a positive association between PFOA and cholesterol, but no evidence of an association with heart disease. There is evidence for an association with ulcerative colitis, but not for other auto-immune diseases. There is good evidence that PFOA is associated with immune response, but uneven evidence for an association with infectious disease. The evidence for an association between PFOA and thyroid and kidney disease is suggestive but uneven. There is evidence of an association with liver enzymes, but not with liver disease. There is little evidence of an association with neurotoxicity. Suggested reductions in birthweight may be due to reverse causality and/or confounding. Fate and transport models and pharmacokinetic models remain central to estimating past exposure for new cohorts, but are difficult to develop without good historical data on emissions of PFOA into the environment. Conclusion: Overall, the epidemiologic evidence remains limited. For a few outcomes there has been some replication of our earlier findings. More longitudinal research is needed in large populations with large exposure contrasts. Additional cross-sectional studies of low exposed populations may be less informative. © 2020",Health effects; PFOA; Review,Cholesterol; Pharmacokinetics; Cross-sectional study; Fate and transport; Hypercholesterolemia; Longitudinal research; Pharmacokinetic model; Pregnancy-induced hypertensions; Scientific evidence; Ulcerative colitis; Diseases; cholesterol; liver enzyme; octanoic acid derivative; perfluoroctanoate; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; environmental fate; enzyme; health impact; immune response; infectious disease; pollutant transport; public health; autoimmune disease; birth weight; cancer risk; environmental exposure; environmental health; genital system disease; health hazard; human; hypercholesterolemia; immune response; immunotoxicity; kidney cancer; liver disease; maternal hypertension; neurotoxicity; Ohio; population research; population size; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; testis cancer; thyroid disease; toxicokinetics; ulcerative colitis; cross-sectional study; female; male; pregnancy; testis tumor; Caprylates; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Male; Ohio; Pregnancy; Testicular Neoplasms,Elsevier Ltd
Exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances and allergic outcomes in children: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Luo Y., Deji Z., Huang Z.",2020,Environmental Research,"Background: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent organic pollutants and widespread throughout the environment. Although exposure to PFASs may contribute to the development of allergic diseases in children, evidence about this association remains inconclusive. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between PFASs exposure and allergic diseases in children based on current evidence. Methods: The databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched to identify all observational studies that examined the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of childhood allergic diseases. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of case-crossover studies, and a previously validated quality assessment framework was used for observational studies lacking control groups. Random-effects meta-analysis models were applied to pool odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: From an initial 94 articles (after duplicate removal), 13 studies through full-text assessment were included for quantitative assessment and descriptive synthesis. They are ten cohort studies, two cross-sectional studies, and one case-control study. The pooled estimates showed that perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was associated with eczema (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.80–0.99), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) with atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.01–1.58), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) with allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.13–1.56). However, no such significant associations were found for wheeze and asthma. Conclusions: The meta-analysis results suggest that PFASs exposure could potentially be associated with eczema, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis during childhood, but not with childhood asthma or wheeze. Future studies are needed to verify these findings. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Asthma; Childhood allergy; Meta-analysis; Perfluoroalkyl substances,perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; allergy; asthma; child health; confidence interval; meta-analysis; model validation; pollution exposure; software; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; childhood; disease association; eczema; human; persistent organic pollutant; priority journal; systematic review; wheezing; case control study; child; cross-sectional study; female; meta analysis; pollutant; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; toxicity; Case-Control Studies; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Academic Press Inc.
Dysregulated lipid and fatty acid metabolism link perfluoroalkyl substances exposure and impaired glucose metabolism in young adults,"Chen Z., Yang T., Walker D.I., Thomas D.C., Qiu C., Chatzi L., Alderete T.L., Kim J.S., Conti D.V., Breton C.V., Liang D., Hauser E.R., Jones D.P., Gilliland F.D.",2020,Environment International,"Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exposure is ubiquitous among the US population and has been linked to adverse health outcomes including cardiometabolic diseases, immune dysregulation and endocrine disruption. However, the metabolic mechanism underlying the adverse health effect of PFASs exposure is unknown. Objective: The aim of this project is to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and altered metabolic pathways linked to increased cardiometabolic risk in young adults. Methods: A total of 102 young adults with 82% overweight or obese participants were enrolled from Southern California between 2014 and 2017. Cardiometabolic outcomes were assessed including oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measures, body fat and lipid profiles. High-resolution metabolomics was used to quantify plasma exposure levels of three PFAS congeners and intensity profiles of the untargeted metabolome. Fasting concentrations of 45 targeted metabolites involved in fatty acid and lipid metabolism were used to verify untargeted metabolomics findings. Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) was used to examine the associations between PFAS exposure mixture and cardiometabolic outcomes adjusting for covariates. Mummichog pathway enrichment analysis was used to explore PFAS-associated metabolic pathways. Moreover, the effect of PFAS exposure on the metabolic network, including metabolomic profiles and cardiometabolic outcomes, was investigated. Results: Higher exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was associated with higher 30-minute glucose levels and glucose area under the curve (AUC) during the OGTT (p < 0.001). PFAS exposure was also associated with altered lipid pathways, which contributed to the metabolic network connecting PFOA and higher glucose levels following the OGTT. Targeted metabolomics analysis indicated that higher PFOA exposure was associated with higher levels of glycerol (p = 0.006), which itself was associated with higher 30-minute glucose (p = 0.006). Conclusions: Increased lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation could contribute to the biological mechanisms linking PFAS exposure and impaired glucose metabolism among young adults. Findings of this study warrants future experimental studies and epidemiological studies with larger sample size to replicate. © 2020 The Author(s)",Cardiometabolic dysfunction; Lipolysis; Metabolomics; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Young adults; β-oxidation,Glucose; Metabolism; Metabolites; Adverse health effects; Epidemiological studies; Fatty acid metabolism; High-resolution metabolomics; Oral glucose tolerance tests; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Fatty acids; alkyl group; glucose; glycerol; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fatty acid; fluorocarbon; glucose; lipid; adult; epidemiology; fatty acid; lipid; metabolism; oxidation; adult; Article; body composition; body fat; body mass; cardiometabolic risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disorders of carbohydrate metabolism; environmental exposure; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; female; glucose level; human; lipid fingerprinting; lipid metabolism; lipolysis; male; metabolic fingerprinting; metabolite; metabolome; metabolomics; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; phenotype; priority journal; young adult; Bayes theorem; lipid metabolism; pollutant; toxicity; Fundulus heteroclitus; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Bayes Theorem; Environmental Pollutants; Fatty Acids; Fluorocarbons; Glucose; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Young Adult,Elsevier Ltd
Uptake and accumulation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in plants,"Wang W., Rhodes G., Ge J., Yu X., Li H.",2020,Chemosphere,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a class of persistent organic contaminants that are ubiquitous in the environment and have been found to be accumulated in agricultural products. Consumption of PFAS-contaminated agricultural products represents a feasible pathway for the trophic transfer of these toxic chemicals along food chains/webs, leading to risks associated with human and animal health. Recently, studies on plant uptake and accumulation of PFASs have rapidly increased; consequently, a review to summarize the current knowledge and highlight future research is needed. Analysis of the publications indicates that a large variety of plant species can take up PFASs from the environment. Vegetables and grains are the most commonly investigated crops, with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) as the most studied PFASs. The potential sources of PFASs for plant uptake include industrial emissions, irrigation with contaminated water, land application of biosolids, leachates from landfill sites, and pesticide application. Root uptake is the predominant pathway for the accumulation of PFASs in agricultural crops, and uptake by plant aboveground portions from the ambient atmosphere could play a minor role in the overall PFAS accumulation. PFAS uptake by plants is influenced by physicochemical properties of compounds (e.g., perfluorocarbon chain length, head group functionality, water solubility, and volatility), plant physiology (e.g., transpiration rate, lipid and protein content), and abiotic factors (e.g., soil organic matters, pH, salinity, and temperature). Based on literature analysis, the current knowledge gaps are identified, and future research prospects are suggested. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Bioaccumulation; Contamination sources; Influencing factors; PFASs; Plant uptake,"Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Crops; Health risks; Industrial emissions; Leachate treatment; Physicochemical properties; Veterinary medicine; Water pollution; Literature analysis; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Persistent organic contaminants; Pesticide applications; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Soil organic matters; Transpiration rates; Uptake and accumulations; Chemical contamination; alkyl group; organic compound; per and polyfluoroalkyl substance; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pesticide; soil organic matter; unclassified drug; water; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; biological uptake; biosolid; landfill; leachate; organic pollutant; pesticide; pesticide residue; protein; toxicity; transpiration; Article; atmosphere; biosolid; crop; food chain; grain; landfill; nonhuman; pH; physical chemistry; plant; plant physiology; protein content; publication; salinity; solubility; temperature; vegetable; water contamination; agriculture; animal; chemistry; human; metabolism; plant; soil; soil pollutant; Animalia; Agriculture; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Caprylates; Crops, Agricultural; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Plants; Soil; Soil Pollutants",Elsevier Ltd
Medical interventions for patellofemoral pain and patellofemoral osteoarthritis: A systematic review,"Macri E.M., Hart H.F., Thwaites D., Barton C.J., Crossley K.M., Bierma-Zeinstra S.M.A., van Middelkoop M.",2020,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Patellofemoral pain (PFP) and patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) are common, persistent conditions that may lie along a pathological spectrum. While evidence supports exercise-therapy as a core treatment for PFP and PFOA, primary care physicians commonly prescribe medication, or refer for surgical consults in persistent cases. We conducted a systematic review of medical interventions (pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and surgical) for PFP and PFOA to inform primary care decision making. Methods: Following protocol registration, we searched seven databases for randomized clinical trials of our target interventions for PFP and PFOA. Our primary outcome was pain. We assessed risk of bias, calculated standardized mean differences (SMDs) and determined the level of evidence for each intervention. Results: We included 14 publications investigating pharmaceutical or nutraceutical interventions, and eight publications investigating surgical interventions. Two randomized control trials (RCTs) provided moderate evidence of patellofemoral arthroplasty having similar pain outcomes compared to total knee arthroplasty in isolated PFOA, with SMDs ranging from -0.3 (95% CI -0.8, 0.2, Western Ontario McMaster Pain Subscale, 1 year post-surgery) to 0.3 (-0.1, 0.7, SF-36 Bodily Pain, 2 years post-surgery). Remaining studies provided, at most, limited evidence. No efficacy was demonstrated for oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories or arthroscopic surgery. Conclusions: Pharmaceutical and nutraceutical prescriptions, and surgical referrals are currently being made with little supporting evidence, with some interventions showing limited efficacy. This should be considered within the broader context of evidence supporting exercise-therapy as a core treatment for PFP and PFOA. © 2020 by the authors.",Nutraceuticals; Patellofemoral osteoarthritis; Patellofemoral pain; Pharmaceuticals; Surgery,aloxiprin; botulinum toxin A; chloroquine; corticosteroid; dexamethasone; diflunisal; glucosamine; glycosaminoglycan polysulfate; hyaluronic acid; nandrolone phenpropionate; naproxen; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; olive oil; paracetamol; piroxicam; adult; arthroscopic surgery; Article; clinical protocol; controlled study; decision making; early intervention; evidence based practice; female; human; iontophoresis; kinesiotherapy; knee osteoarthritis; major clinical study; male; meta analysis; middle aged; Ontario; pain assessment; patellofemoral pain syndrome; primary medical care; randomized controlled trial; risk assessment; Short Form 36; systematic review; total knee arthroplasty; treatment outcome; ultrasound,MDPI

A critical review on metal-organic frameworks and their composites as advanced materials for adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of emerging organic pollutants from wastewater,"Zango Z.U., Jumbri K., Sambudi N.S., Ramli A., Bakar N.H.H.A., Saad B., Rozaini M.N.H., Isiyaka H.A., Jagaba A.H., Aldaghri O., Sulieman A.",2020,Polymers,"Water-borne emerging pollutants are among the greatest concern of our modern society. Many of these pollutants are categorized as endocrine disruptors due to their environmental toxicities. They are harmful to humans, aquatic animals, and plants, to the larger extent, destroying the ecosystem. Thus, effective environmental remediations of these pollutants became necessary. Among the various remediation techniques, adsorption and photocatalytic degradation have been single out as the most promising. This review is devoted to the compilations and analysis of the role of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their composites as potential materials for such applications. Emerging organic pollutants, like dyes, herbicides, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and perfluorinated alkyl substances, have been extensively studied. Important parameters that affect these processes, such as surface area, bandgap, percentage removal, equilibrium time, adsorption capacity, and recyclability, are documented. Finally, we paint the current scenario and challenges that need to be addressed for MOFs and their composites to be exploited for commercial applications. © 2020 by the authors.

"Are concentrations of pollutants in sharks, rays and skates (Elasmobranchii) a cause for concern? A systematic review","Tiktak G.P., Butcher D., Lawrence P.J., Norrey J., Bradley L., Shaw K., Preziosi R., Megson D.",2020,Marine Pollution Bulletin,"This review represents a comprehensive analysis on pollutants in elasmobranchs including meta-analysis on the most studied pollutants: mercury, cadmium, PCBs and DDTs, in muscle and liver tissue. Elasmobranchs are particularly vulnerable to pollutant exposure which may pose a risk to the organism as well as humans that consume elasmobranch products. The highest concentrations of pollutants were found in sharks occupying top trophic levels (Carcharhiniformes and Lamniformes). A human health risk assessment identified that children and adults consuming shark once a week are exposed to over three times more mercury than is recommended by the US EPA. This poses a risk to local fishing communities and international consumers of shark-based products, as well as those subject to the widespread mislabelling of elasmobranch products. Wider screening studies are recommended to determine the risk to elasmobranchs from emerging pollutants and more robust studies are recommended to assess the risks to human health. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Cadmium; DDT; Elasmobranch; Mercury; PCB; Pollution,"Health risks; Mercury (metal); Pollution; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Comprehensive analysis; Emerging pollutants; Human health; Human health risk assessment; Meta analysis; Pollutant exposures; Systematic Review; Trophic level; Risk assessment; cadmium; chlorphenotane; mercury; polychlorinated biphenyl; mercury; cadmium; concentration (composition); DDT; literature review; mercury (element); meta-analysis; muscle; PCB; pollution exposure; shark; bioaccumulation; chemical analysis; concentration (parameter); environmental exposure; food intake; health hazard; health impact assessment; human; liver; muscle; nonhuman; Review; risk assessment; shark; skate (fish); water pollution; animal; child; elasmobranch; meta analysis; pollutant; sea food; water pollutant; Carcharhiniformes; Chondrichthyes; Elasmobranchii; Lamniformes; Animals; Child; Elasmobranchii; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Mercury; Seafood; Sharks; Skates, Fish; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier Ltd
Emerging disinfection byproducts: A review on their occurrence and control in drinking water treatment processes,"Gilca A.F., Teodosiu C., Fiore S., Musteret C.P.",2020,Chemosphere,"The occurrence of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) is related both to drinking water treatment (DWT) processes and to raw water's characteristics. Emerging pollutants typically occur in low concentrations and are not removed by conventional DWT processes. Emerging DBPs appear within the DWT or in the distribution system due to the combination of disinfection agents (especially chlorine) with precursors as: natural organic matter (NOM), algal organic matter (AOM), anthropogenic contaminants (pesticides, pharmaceuticals, detergents etc.), brominated and iodinated compounds. This study has as main goal a consistent analysis of the major problems caused by emerging DBPs to drinking water supplies. It presents a comprehensive review of the research efforts related to emerging DBPs considering three viewpoints: 1. an overview of their classification, legislative framework, methods of analysis, disinfection operational conditions and removal processes; 2. their occurrence, fate, health effects and impacts; 3. the analysis of the advanced DWT processes that might be used for the removal and control of precursors and DBPs, with a focus on pilot and full-scale installations. All presented case studies considered pollutants removed, process conditions and efficiencies, and a critical assessment of processes based on membranes, advanced oxidation and adsorption on activated carbon or other materials.

However, compared to well-established noble-metal-catalyzed carbonylation reactions, analogue coupling via base-metal, nickel catalysis has received less attention because of the easy formation of highly toxic and unreactive Ni(CO)4 species between Ni(0) and CO. To date, the use of inexpensive and widely available carbon monoxide (CO) gas for nickel-catalyzed carbonylation reaction remains challenging, and nickel-catalyzed four-component carbonylative reaction has not been reported yet. Here, we report a highly selective nickel-catalyzed four-component carbocarbonylation of alkenes under 1 atm (1 atm) of CO gas to efficiently achieve an array of complex carbonyl compounds, including fluorinated amino acids and oligopeptides of great interest in medicinal chemistry and chemical biology. This reaction relies on a nickel-catalyzed one-pot cascade process to assemble CO, arylboronic acids, and difluoroalkyl electrophiles across the carbon-carbon double bond of alkenes, paving a new way for base-metal-catalyzed carbonylative cascade reaction. © 2020 ACS.

Are Fluoropolymers Really of Low Concern for Human and Environmental Health and Separate from Other PFAS?,"Lohmann R., Cousins I.T., Dewitt J.C., Glüge J., Goldenman G., Herzke D., Lindstrom A.B., Miller M.F., Ng C.A., Patton S., Scheringer M., Trier X., Wang Z.",2020,Environmental Science and Technology,"Fluoropolymers are a group of polymers within the class of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the evidence regarding the environmental and human health impacts of fluoropolymers throughout their life cycle(s). Production of some fluoropolymers is intimately linked to the use and emissions of legacy and novel PFAS as polymer processing aids. There are serious concerns regarding the toxicity and adverse effects of fluorinated processing aids on humans and the environment. A variety of other PFAS, including monomers and oligomers, are emitted during the production, processing, use, and end-of-life treatment of fluoropolymers. There are further concerns regarding the safe disposal of fluoropolymers and their associated products and articles at the end of their life cycle. While recycling and reuse of fluoropolymers is performed on some industrial waste, there are only limited options for their recycling from consumer articles. The evidence reviewed in this analysis does not find a scientific rationale for concluding that fluoropolymers are of low concern for environmental and human health. Given fluoropolymers' extreme persistence; emissions associated with their production, use, and disposal; and a high likelihood for human exposure to PFAS, their production and uses should be curtailed except in cases of essential uses. ©",,Health; Life cycle; Recycling; Adverse effect; End of life treatments; Environmental health; Human exposures; Human health impacts; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Polymer processing; Processing aids; Fluorine containing polymers; monomer; oligomer; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; polymer; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; polyethylene; chemical substance; polymer; public health; recycling; Article; cell membrane; environmental health; human; industrial waste; leaching; life cycle; macromolecule; molecular weight; pollution; recycling; synthesis; environmental health; Environmental Health; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Polyethylene,American Chemical Society
Oxalic Acid in Root Exudates Enhances Accumulation of Perfluorooctanoic Acid in Lettuce,"Xiang L., Chen X.-T., Yu P.-F., Li X.-H., Zhao H.-M., Feng N.-X., Li Y.-W., Li H., Cai Q.-Y., Mo C.-H., Li Q.X.",2020,Environmental Science and Technology,"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is bioaccumulative in crops. PFOA bioaccumulation potential varies largely among crop varieties. Root exudates are found to be associated with such variations. Concentrations of low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) in root exudates from a PFOA-high-accumulation lettuce variety are observed significantly higher than those from PFOA-low-accumulation lettuce variety (p < 0.05). Root exudates and their LMWOAs components exert great influences on the linear sorption-desorption isotherms of PFOA in soils, thus activating PFOA and enhancing its bioavailability. Among root exudate components, oxalic acid is identified to play a key role in activating PFOA uptake, with >80% attribution. Oxalic acid at rhizospheric concentrations (0.02-0.5 mM) can effectively inhibit PFOA sorption to soils by decreasing hydrophobic force, electrostatic attraction, ligand exchange, and cation-bridge effect. Oxalic acid enhances dissolution of metallic ions, iron/aluminum oxides, and organic matters from soils and forms oxalate-metal complexes, based on nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, ultraviolet spectra, and analyses of metal ions, iron/aluminum organometallic complexes, and dissolved organic carbon. The findings not only reveal the activation process of PFOA in soils by root exudates, particularly oxalic acid at rhizospheric concentrations, but also give an insight into the mechanism of enhancing PFOA accumulation in lettuce varieties. ©",bioaccumulation; bioavailability; desorption; food safety; perfluorinated alkyl substance; PFAS; root exudate,Biochemistry; Chemical activation; Crops; Iron oxides; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Metal complexes; Metal ions; Metals; Organic carbon; Organometallics; Oxalic acid; Soils; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Activation process; Bioaccumulation potential; Dissolved organic carbon; Electrostatic attractions; Hydrophobic forces; Low molecular weight organic acid; Organo-metallic complexes; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Soil pollution; acetic acid; aluminum oxide; carboxylic acid; cation; citric acid; dissolved organic matter; iron; ligand; malonic acid; metal complex; metal ion; organic carbon; organic matter; organometallic compound; oxalic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; oxalic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; bioaccumulation; cultivar; dissolution; exudation; leafy vegetable; ligand; nuclear magnetic resonance; oxalic acid; sorption; Article; bioaccumulation; bioavailability; concentration (parameter); controlled study; desorption; fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance; hydrophobicity; isotherm; lettuce; molecular weight; nonhuman; rhizosphere; root exudate; soil; ultraviolet radiation; ultraviolet spectroscopy; exudate; Lactuca; Caprylates; Exudates and Transudates; Fluorocarbons; Lettuce; Oxalic Acid,American Chemical Society
Environmental levels and human body burdens of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances in Africa: A critical review,"Ssebugere P., Sillanpää M., Matovu H., Wang Z., Schramm K.-W., Omwoma S., Wanasolo W., Ngeno E.C., Odongo S.",2020,Science of the Total Environment,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are known organic pollutants with adverse health effects on humans and the ecosystem. This paper synthesises literature about the status of the pollutants and their precursors, identifies knowledge gaps and discusses future perspectives on the study of PFASs in Africa. Limited data on PFASs prevalence in Africa is available because there is limited capacity to monitor PFASs in African laboratories. The levels of PFASs in Africa are higher in samples from urban and industrialized areas compared to rural areas. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are the dominant PFASs in human samples from Africa. Levels of PFOS and PFOA in these samples are lower than or comparable to those from industrialized countries. PFOA and PFOS levels in drinking water in Africa are, in some cases, higher than the EPA drinking water guidelines suggesting potential risk to humans. The levels of PFASs in birds' eggs from South Africa are higher, while those in other environmental media from Africa are lower or comparable to those from industrialized countries. Diet influences the pollutant levels in fish, while size and sex affect their accumulation in crocodiles. No bioaccumulation of PFASs in aquatic systems in Africa could be confirmed due to small sample sizes. Reported sources of PFASs in Africa include municipal landfills, inefficient wastewater treatment plants, consumer products containing PFASs, industrial wastewater and urban runoff. Relevant stakeholders need to take serious action to identify and deal with the salient sources of PFASs on the African continent. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Africa; Human body burdens; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances; PFOA; PFOS,"Biochemistry; Consumer products; Environmental Protection Agency; Organic pollutants; Potable water; Sewage; Wastewater treatment; Adverse health effects; Environmental levels; Industrial wastewaters; Industrialized countries; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Wastewater treatment plants; Industrial water treatment; drinking water; organic compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; bioaccumulation; critical analysis; drinking water; landfill; organic pollutant; organofluorine; pollution monitoring; wastewater treatment plant; Africa; ambient air; aquatic environment; body burden; developed country; diet; environmental monitoring; fish; human; nonhuman; pollutant; prevalence; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; rural area; sediment; sludge; urban area; urban rural difference; waste management; wildlife; animal; body burden; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; pollutant; South Africa; waste water; water pollutant; South Africa; Aves; Crocodylidae (all crocodiles); Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Body Burden; Caprylates; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; South Africa; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier B.V.
Fluorometer for Screening of Doxorubicin in Perfusate Solution and Tissue with Solid-Phase Microextraction Chemical Biopsy Sampling,"Galievsky V., Pawliszyn J.",2020,Analytical Chemistry,"The recent development of an in vivo solid-phase microextraction (SPME) method capable of analyzing drugs and metabolic products in biofluids and living tissues holds great promise. The standard in vivo SPME protocol based on mass spectrometry is a very powerful analytical approach, but it is not practical for on-site analysis in many cases. In this paper, we present a fluorescence-based SPME method and a prototype of a portable fluorometer that is capable of quickly quantifying concentrations of the anticancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX). The instrument uses thin coated, biocompatible SPME fibers, which we have previously presented as a chemical biopsy tool for use during in vivo lung perfusion (IVLP) procedures within a hospital setting. In this research, we test SPME fibers with C8-SCX, C18, and HLB coatings with our fluorometer. The mixed-mode C8-SCX fibers showed the best sensitivity of the three and were therefore used to examine DOX extraction from perfusate solution and a homogenized lamb lung tissue. The maximum concentration of free active sites in the C8-SCX fiber and the adsorption equilibrium constant were determined to be (9.1 ± 0.3) × 10-7 mol m-2 and 420 ± 30 m3 mol-1, respectively. Finally, the detection limits for DOX extracted from buffer, perfusate, and lung tissue were 40, 100, and 3700 μg L-1, respectively.

Microtubule cytoskeleton and spermatogenesis-lesson from studies of toxicant models,"Wang L., Yan M., Wu S., Mao B., Wong C.K.C., Ge R., Sun F., Cheng C.Y.",2020,Toxicological Sciences,"Studies have shown that mammalian testes, in particular the Sertoli cells, are highly susceptible to exposure of environmental toxicants, such as cadmium, perfluorooctanesulfonate, phthalates, 2,5-hexanedione and bisphenol A. However, important studies conducted by reproductive toxicologists and/or biologists in the past have been treated as toxicology reports per se. Yet, many of these studies provided important mechanistic insights on the toxicant-induced testis injury and reproductive dysfunction, relevant to the biology of the testis and spermatogenesis. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that findings obtained from toxicant models are exceedingly helpful tools to unravel the biology of testis function in particular spermatogenesis, including specific cellular events associated with spermatid transport to support spermiogenesis and spermiation. In this review, we critically evaluate some recent data, focusing primarily on the molecular structure and role of microtubules in cellular function, illustrating the importance of toxicant models to unravel the biology of microtubule cytoskeleton in supporting spermatogenesis, well beyond information on toxicology. These findings have opened up some potential areas of research which should be carefully evaluated in the years to come. © The Author(s) 2020.",+TIPs; -TIPs; GTPases; MAPs; MARKs; Microtubules; PCP proteins; Spermatogenesis; Testis,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; acetonylacetone; binding protein; cadmium; guanosine triphosphatase; microtubule associated protein; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; phosphotransferase; phthalic acid derivative; toxic substance; animal model; cell function; cell structure; cytoskeleton; male; microtubule; nonhuman; protein binding; protein domain; protein function; protein targeting; Review; spermatid; spermatogenesis; testis; animal; dangerous goods; microtubule; Sertoli cell; toxicity; Animals; Cytoskeleton; Hazardous Substances; Male; Microtubules; Sertoli Cells; Spermatogenesis; Testis",Oxford University Press
Urbanization in China is associated with pronounced perturbation of plasma metabolites,"Wang Y., Sha W., Wang H., Howard A.G., Tsilimigras M.C.B., Zhang J., Su C., Wang Z., Zhang B., Fodor A.A., Gordon-Larsen P.",2020,Metabolomics,"Introduction: Urbanization is associated with major changes in environmental and lifestyle exposures that may influence metabolic signatures. Objectives: We investigated cross-sectional urban and rural differences in plasma metabolome analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry platform in 500 Chinese adults aged 25–68 years from two neighboring southern Chinese provinces. Methods: We first examined the overall metabolome differences by urban and rural residential location, using Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) and random forest classification. We then tested the association between urbanization status and individual metabolites using a linear regression adjusting for age, sex, and province and conducted pathway analysis (Fisher’s exact test) to identify metabolic pathways differed by urbanization status. Results: We observed distinct overall metabolome by urbanization status in OPLS-DA and random forest classification. Using linear regression, out of a total of 1108 unique metabolite features identified in this sample, we found that 266 metabolites were differed by urbanization status (positive false discovery rate-adjusted p-value, q-value < 0.05). For example, the following metabolites were positively associated with urbanization status: caffeine metabolites from xanthine metabolism, hazardous pollutants like 4-hydroxychlorothalonil and perfluorooctanesulfonate, and metabolites implicated in cardiometabolic diseases, such as branched-chain amino acids. In pathway analysis, we found that xanthine metabolism pathways differed by urbanization status (q-value = 1.64E−04). Conclusion: We detected profound differences in host metabolites by urbanization status. Urban residents were characterized by metabolites signaling caffeine metabolism and toxic pollutants and metabolites on known pathways to cardiometabolic disease risks, compared to their rural counterparts. Our findings highlight the importance of considering urbanization in metabolomics analysis. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",China; Plasma metabolomics; Pollution; Urbanization,"4 hydroxychlorothalonil; branched chain amino acid; caffeine; chlorothalonil; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; unclassified drug; xanthine; biological marker; adult; Article; cardiovascular risk; China; cross-sectional study; dietary intake; discriminant analysis; environmental health; female; human; income; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; major clinical study; male; meat; metabolic fingerprinting; metabolome; metabolomics; physical activity; plasma metabolomics; population density; principal component analysis; public health; receiver operating characteristic; social behavior; urbanization; xanthine metabolism; aged; blood; chemistry; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; metabolism; metabolome; middle aged; physiology; plasma; procedures; urban population; urbanization; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers; China; Chromatography, Liquid; Cross-Sectional Studies; Discriminant Analysis; Female; Humans; Male; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Middle Aged; Plasma; Urban Population; Urbanization",Springer
Functional traits in macrophyte studies: Current trends and future research agenda,"Dalla Vecchia A., Villa P., Bolpagni R.",2020,Aquatic Botany,"The use of functional traits (FTs) can provide quantitative information to explain macrophyte ecology more effectively than traditional taxonomic-based methods. This research aims to elucidate the trait-based approaches used in recent macrophyte studies to outline their applications, shortcomings, and future challenges. A systematic literature review focused on macrophytes and FTs was carried out on Scopus database (last accessed May 2020). The latest 520 papers published from 2010 to 2020, which represent 70 % of the whole literature selected since 1969, were carefully screened. Reviewed studies mainly investigated: 1) the role of FTs in shaping communities; 2) the responses of macrophytes to environmental gradients; 3) the application of FTs in monitoring anthropic pressures; and 4) the reasons for success of invasive species. Studied areas were concentrated in Europe (41 %) and Asia (32 %), overlooking other important biodiversity hotspots, and only 6.2 % of the world macrophytes species were investigated in dedicated single species studies. The FTs most commonly used include leaf economic and morphological traits, and we noticed a lack of attention on root traits and in general on spatial traits patterns, as well as a relatively poor understanding of how FTs mediate biotic interactions. High-throughput techniques, such as remote sensing, allow to map fine-scale variability of selected traits within and across systems, helping to clarify multiple links of FTs with ecological drivers and processes. We advise to promote investigations on root traits, and to push forward the integration of multiple approaches to better clarify the role of macrophytes at multiple scales. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Anthropic pressures; Aquatic environments; Leaf economics; Macrophytes; Remote sensing; Root traits,biodiversity; environmental gradient; future prospect; invasive species; literature review; macrophyte; morphology; taxonomy; trend analysis; Asia; Europe; Scopus,Elsevier B.V.

On-line microcolumn-based dynamic leaching method for investigation of lead bioaccessibility in shooting range soils,"Joon N.K., Ek P., Zevenhoven M., Hupa L., Miró M., Bobacka J., Lisak G.",2020,Chemosphere,"In this work, a miniaturized flow-through leaching test is presented for rapid screening of potential chemical extractants to explore the bioaccessibility of lead (Pb) in contaminated shooting range soils in Valkeala, Finland. The method combines the versatility of microcolumn-based extraction methods with on-line inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) analysis for expedient assessment of the magnitude of the bioaccessible pools and the leaching kinetics of lead from polluted soils under variable physicochemical scenarios. Acids and salt solutions were studied as potential extractants. The efficiency of the extractants relative to the initial total amount of lead in the soil sample (509 ± 21 mg/kg) were found to increase in the following order: 0.11 M acetic acid (55%) &lt; 1 M MgCl2 (58%) &lt; 0.1 M NH2OH·HCl (61%) &lt; 0.1 M citric acid (93%) &lt; 0.1 M HCl (96%). The proposed on-line microcolumn-based method was further explored for implementation of the modified BCR (now termed Standards, Measurements and Testing Programme, SM&amp;T) sequential extraction procedure to avail the information about different fractions available in the solid sample, and validated by mass balance calculations. The equivalent sequential procedure in a batch format was then studied and compared against the on-line microcolumn extraction method. The on-line dynamic extraction system presented in this work accepts a substantial amount of sample (2.5 g) as compared to previous flow-through mini-column setups (generally accommodating &lt; 0.25 g of sample), thus maintaining sample representativeness and fostering comprehension of the extraction patterns for non-homogenous soil materials. The use of cotton buds and Teflon membranes and holders in the microcolumn setup facilitates the repeatable flow-through leaching of trace elements and restrict formation of preferential channels. Monitoring of the leachable trace elements in real time delivers detailed insight into the ongoing extraction process and provides a time-saving assessment of potential chemical extractants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",ICP OES assays; Leaching kinetics; Metal bioaccessibility; On-line column extraction; Real-time metal analysis,"Chlorine compounds; Extraction; Inductively coupled plasma; Leaching; Magnesium compounds; Optical emission spectroscopy; Soils; Trace elements; Extraction patterns; Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry; Lead bioaccessibility; Mass-balance calculations; Sequential extraction procedure; Sequential procedures; Shooting range soils; Standards , measurements and testing; Soil pollution; acetic acid; citric acid; deionized water; hydrochloric acid; hydrogen peroxide; hydroxylamine; lead; magnesium chloride; nitric acid; politef; sodium chloride; trace element; lead; trace element; acetic acid; citric acid; cotton; extraction method; leaching; reaction kinetics; real time; sequential extraction; Article; batch process; bioaccessibility; biotransformation; extraction; Finland; fractionation; heavy metal removal; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry; intermethod comparison; leaching; lead poisoning; measurement repeatability; miniaturization; modified bcr sequential extraction; online monitoring; physical chemistry; shooting range soil; soil; soil pollution; solid; chemistry; kinetics; online system; soil; soil pollutant; Finland; Gossypium hirsutum; Finland; Kinetics; Lead; Online Systems; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Trace Elements",Elsevier Ltd
Chinese clinical practice guideline for patellofemoral osteoarthritis (2020 edition) [中国髌股关节骨关节炎诊疗指南(2020年版)],"National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders (Xiangya Hospital), Joint Surgery Branch of the Chinese Orthopaedic Association",2020,Chinese Journal of Orthopaedics,"Patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) is a subtype of knee osteoarthritis, featuring high prevalence and heavy disease burden. Previous clinical practice guidelines of knee osteoarthritis mainly focused on tibiofemoral joint osteoarthritis, whereas PFOA has drawn more attention in recent years. Therefore, it is necessary to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of PFOA in the clinical setting. The Guideline Working Panel, consisted of clinical specialists in the field of orthopaedic joint surgery, adopted methods in accordance to WHO guideline handbook when making the present guideline. Firstly, several rounds of online survey of clinicians was conducted to determine important clinical questions. After reviewing of the literatures concerning published systematic reviews, clinical trials, and observational studies in the field of PFOA and evaluation of quality of the evidence found, determination of consensus recommendations and strength of these recommendations were performed following several rounds of Delphi process. Ultimately, a total of 12 recommendations, involving the diagnosis (symptoms, signs and imaging changes), non-surgical (primary treatment and pharmacotherapy) and surgical interventions (repair and reconstruction) of PFOA, were developed. The present guideline aimed to guide decision-making of diagnosis and treatment of PFOA in clinical practices in China.

Chemical identity and cardiovascular toxicity of hydrophobic organic components in PM2.5,"Qi Z., Zhang Y., Chen Z.-F., Yang C., Song Y., Liao X., Li W., Tsang S.Y., Liu G., Cai Z.",2020,Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Numerous experimental and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that exposure to PM2.5 may result in pathogenesis of several major cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which can be attributed to the combined adverse effects induced by the complicated components of PM2.5. Organic materials, which are major components of PM2.5, contain thousands of chemicals, and most of them are environmental hazards. However, the contamination profile and contribution to overall toxicity of PM2.5-bound organic components (OCs) have not been thoroughly evaluated yet. Herein, we aim to provide an overview of the literature on PM2.5-bound hydrophobic OCs, with an emphasis on the chemical identity and reported impairments on the cardiovascular system, including the potential exposure routes and mechanisms. We first provide an update on the worldwide mass concentration and composition data of PM2.5, and then, review the contamination profile of PM2.5-bound hydrophobic OCs, including constitution, concentration, distribution, formation, source, and identification. In particular, the link between exposure to PM2.5-bound hydrophobic OCs and CVDs and its possible underlying mechanisms are discussed to evaluate the possible risks of PM2.5-bound hydrophobic OCs on the cardiovascular system and to provide suggestions for future studies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Cardiovascular toxicity; Contamination profile; Hydrophobic organic components; Mechanisms; PM2.5,"2,2',4,4' tetrabromodiphenyl ether; 2,2',4,4',5,5' hexabromodiphenyl ether; 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; benzo[a]pyrene; benzo[b]fluoranthene; benzo[ghi]perylene; benzo[k]fluoranthene; decabromodiphenyl ether; heptachlor; indeno[1,2,3 cd]pyrene; lindane; mirex; organic compound; organochlorine pesticide; organohalogen derivative; organophosphorus compound; paraffin; polybrominated biphenyl; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative; organic compound; cardiovascular system; chemical analysis; future prospect; health risk; hydrophobicity; literature review; particulate matter; pathogenicity; toxicity; air pollution; air quality; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; chemical composition; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; gene mutation; health hazard; human; human activities; hydrophobicity; particle size; particulate matter; Review; secondary organic aerosol; systematic review; air pollutant; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular system; chemical phenomena; chemistry; drug effect; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; procedures; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular System; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Organic Chemicals; Particulate Matter",Academic Press
MSC-based therapy in female pelvic floor disorders,"Sima Y., Chen Y.",2020,Cell and Bioscience,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), also referred to as multipotent stromal cells or mesenchymal stromal cells, are present in multiple tissues and capable of differentiating into diverse cell lineages, holding a great promise in developing cell-based therapy for a wide range of conditions. Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is a common degenerative disease in women and may diminish a woman's quality of life at any age. Since the treatments for this disease are limited by the high rates of recurrence and surgical complications, seeking an ideal therapy in the restoration of pelvic floor function is an urgent issue at present. Herein, we summarize the cell sources of MSCs used for PFDs and discuss the potential mechanisms of MSCs in treating PFDs. Specifically, we also provide a comprehensive review of current preclinical and clinical trials dedicated to investigating MSC-based therapy for PFDs. The novel therapy has presented promising therapeutic effects which include relieving the symptoms of urinary or fecal incontinence, improving the biological properties of implanted meshes and promoting the injured tissue repair. Nevertheless, MSC-based therapies for PFDs are still experimental and the unstated issues on their safety and efficacy should be carefully addressed before their clinical applications. © 2020 The Author(s).",Cell-A nd tissue-based therapy; Mesenchymal stem cells; Mesenchymal stem cells transplantation; Pelvic floor disorders,adipose derived stem cell; bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell; cell homing; cell survival; clinical trial (topic); endometrium; feces incontinence; female; human; immunomodulation; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; muscle stem cell; nonhuman; paracrine signaling; pelvic floor disorder; preclinical study; Review; secretomics; tissue engineering; tissue repair; urine incontinence,BioMed Central Ltd
Optimal surgical methods to treat intertrochanteric fracture: A Bayesian network meta-analysis based on 36 randomized controlled trials,"Cheng Y.-X., Sheng X.",2020,Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research,"Background: There are several surgical methods to treat intertrochanteric fracture: dynamic hip screw (DHS), compression hip screw (CHS), percutaneous compression plate (PCCP), Medoff sliding plate, less invasive stabilization system (LISS), Gamma nail, proximal femoral nail (PFN), and proximal femoral nail anti-rotating (PFNA). We therefore conducted a network meta-analysis to compare eight surgical interventions, including DHS, CHS, PCCP, Medoff sliding plate, LISS, Gamma nail, PFN, and PFNA, to provide the optimal surgical intervention for intertrochanteric fracture. Methods: An electronic search of 4 databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, and Web of Science) from inception to July 2020. Two or more of the eight surgical interventions, including the DHS, CHS, PCCP, Medoff sliding plate, LISS, Gamma nail, PFN, and PFNA, for intertrochanteric fracture were included. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias (ROB) tool. Network meta-analysis was conducted by using R-3.5.1 software with the help of package ""gemtc"". The odd ratios (ORs) with 95% credibility interval (CrI) were used to assess complications and standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% CrI to calculate the continuous outcomes (operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and Harris hip score). Surfaces under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA) were used to rank the intervention. Results: A total of 36 RCTs were included in this study. The results of this network meta-analysis showed that, compared with the CHS and DHS group, PFNA exhibited a beneficial role in reducing the blood loss (SMD, 152.50; 95% CrI, 72.93 to 232.45; and SMD, 184.40; 95% CrI, 132.99 to 235.90, respectively). PFNA achieved the lowest value for the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for the blood loss (SURCA = 0.072) and highest of Harris hip score (SURCA = 0.912).

Pathogenetic substantiation of therapeutic and preventive measures in severe coronavirus infection [Patogenetski dokaz o terapeutskim i preventivnim merama kod ozbiljne infekcije koronavirusom],"Novikov A.A., Bolevich S., Vorobjov S.I., Novikova N.A., Bolotov D.D., Yakovchenko A.V.",2020,Serbian Journal of Experimental and Clinical Research,"The basis of coronavirus disease is an infectious process, ac-companied by a varying degree of activity of pathological pro-cesses. Based on the study of the pathological course of infection, modern approaches to the treatment and prevention of complications of coronavirus infection are presented. The main strategic pathogenetic direction in the creation of effective programs for the treatment of COVID-19, as well as the prevention of fatal com-plications, should be a set of measures enhancing permissive regulatory influences and events. Endothelium, being a source of inflammatory mediators and a transducer of their regulatory effects on the vascular tone, is involved in the development and alterna-tion of vascular reactions, changing the volume of perfusion. The main mechanism for the development of endothelial dysfunction and damage is associated with an imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species and the power of the antioxidant defense system. Any measures to protect the endothelium, reduc-ing the severity of microcirculatory disorders and hypoxia, will have a therapeutic and preventive effect on fatal complications. In this regard, in the treatment of COVID-19, the use of synthetic gas transport preparations based on perfluorocarbon nanodispersed emulsions with a clinical effect directed at once to several patho-genetic links underlying the progression of COVID-19 disease can be quite effective. The necessity of a comprehensive effect on pathogenesis using sanogenetic principles of treatment, allowing influencing the speed and time of onset of resolution of inflamma-tion, which can reduce the number of complications and deaths of the disease, is substantiated.

"Are persistent organic pollutants linked to lipid abnormalities, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease? A review","Monica Lind P., Lind L.",2020,Journal of Lipid and Atherosclerosis,"The term persistent organic pollutants (POPs) denotes chemicals with known or suspected adverse health effects in animals or humans and with chemical properties that make them accumulate in the environment, including animals or humans. Lipid-soluble POPs, like dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides are transported by lipoproteins and accumulate in adipose tissue. High levels of these compounds in the circulation have been associated with elevated cholesterol and triglycerides in cross-sectional studies and with an increase in mainly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a longitudinal study. Also, non-lipid-soluble POPs, such as perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) compounds have been associated with increased total cholesterol levels. Carotid artery atherosclerosis has been related to elevated levels of mainly highly chlorinated PCBs and to highly fluorinated PFASs, but in this case only in women. Both cross-sectional and prospective studies have shown dioxins, PCBs, as well as PFASs to be linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. In conclusion, as highlighted in this review, several lines of evidence support the view that POPs of different chemical classes could be linked to lipid abnormalities, carotid atherosclerosis and overt CVD like myocardial infarction and stroke. © 2020 The Korean Society of Lipid and Atherosclerosis.",Atherosclerosis; Cardiovascular diseases; Fatty liver; Lipids; Toxicology,,Korean Society of Lipid and Atherosclerosis
Assessment of transcriptomic constraint-based methods for central carbon flux inference,"Bhadra-Lobo, Kim M.K., Lun D.S.",2020,PLoS ONE,"Motivation Determining intracellular metabolic flux through isotope labeling techniques such as 13C metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) incurs significant cost and effort. Previous studies have shown transcriptomic data coupled with constraint-based metabolic modeling can determine intracellular fluxes that correlate highly with 13C-MFA measured fluxes and can achieve higher accuracy than constraint-based metabolic modeling alone. These studies, however, used validation data limited to E. coli and S. cerevisiae grown on glucose, with significantly similar flux distribution for central metabolism. It is unclear whether those results apply to more diverse metabolisms, and therefore further, extensive validation is needed. Results In this paper, we formed a dataset of transcriptomic data coupled with corresponding 13C-MFA flux data for 21 experimental conditions in different unicellular organisms grown on varying carbon substrates and conditions. Three computational flux-balance analysis (FBA) methods were comparatively assessed. The results show when uptake rates of carbon sources and key metabolites are known, transcriptomic data provides no significant advantage over constraint-based metabolic modeling (average correlation coefficients, transcriptomic E-Flux2 0.725 and SPOT 0.650 vs non-transcriptomic pFBA 0.768). When uptake rates are unknown, however, predictions obtained utilizing transcriptomic data are generally good and significantly better than those obtained using constraint-based metabolic modeling alone (E-Flux2 0.385 and SPOT 0.583 vs pFBA 0.237). Thus, transcriptomic data coupled with constraint-based metabolic modeling is a promising method to obtain intracellular flux estimates in microorganisms, particularly in cases where uptake rates of key metabolites cannot be easily determined, such as for growth in complex media or in vivo conditions. © 2020 Bhadra-Lobo et al.",,"Article; Bacillus subtilis; carbon source; cell metabolism; controlled study; Escherichia coli; gene expression; in vivo study; metabolic flux analysis; metabolite; microarray analysis; mixotrophy; nonhuman; prediction; RNA sequence; Synechocystis; transcriptomics; bacterium; carbon cycle; decision tree; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; Synechococcus; carbon; transcriptome; Bacillus subtilis; Bacteria; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Decision Trees; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Synechococcus; Synechocystis; Transcriptome",Public Library of Science
Evidence-Based Women’s Health Physical Therapy Across the Lifespan,Badillo S.A.,2020,Current Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Reports,"Purpose of Review: The aim of this paper is to review the current evidence for physical therapy (PT) in the treatment of pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) in women throughout the female lifespan. Recent Findings: Although trials are small and heterogeneous, there is an increase in evidence to support PT as a safe, effective treatment option for women with PFDs at various life stages. Evidence to support PT interventions for pelvic floor conditions including dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause are discussed. Clinicians are recommended to consider prevention and wellness strategies to promote pelvic health for women and screen for PFDs for early intervention. Summary: At various stages along the lifespan, a woman may be at risk for PFDs, impacting function, and quality of life. Knowledge of the potential risk factors based on a women’s history and life stage to appropriately screen for PFDs may facilitate early intervention. Pelvic health PT is considered to be a low risk, effective treatment option for women with PFDs. Future research is needed to determine longer term outcomes and potential prevention strategies for women on a larger scale. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Incontinence; Pelvic floor disorders; Pelvic floor muscle training; Pelvic pain; Pelvic physical therapy; Women’s health,,Springer
"Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) and Their Effects on the Placenta, Pregnancy, and Child Development: a Potential Mechanistic Role for Placental Peroxisome Proliferator–Activated Receptors (PPARs)","Szilagyi J.T., Avula V., Fry R.C.",2020,Current Environmental Health Reports,"Purpose of Review: This review summarizes studies highlighting perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and their effects on the placenta, pregnancy outcomes, and child health. It highlights human population-based associations as well as in vitro-based experimental data to inform an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these health effects. Among the mechanisms by which PFAS may induce toxicity is via their interaction with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), nuclear receptors that regulate lipid metabolism and placental functions important to healthy pregnancies, as well as fetal and child development. Recent Findings: In utero exposure to prevalent environmental contaminants such as PFAS is associated with negative health outcomes during pregnancy, birth outcomes, and later in life. Specifically, PFAS have been associated with increased incidence of gestational diabetes, childhood obesity, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. In terms of placental molecular mechanisms underlying these associations, studies demonstrate that PFAS interfere with trophoblast lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and invasion. Moreover these effects could be mediated in part by the interaction between PFAS and PPARs, as well as other biological mechanisms. Summary: This review summarizes how PFAS, critical environmental contaminants, may contribute to diseases of pregnancy as well as early and later child health. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Development; In utero; PFAS; Placenta; PPAR; Preeclampsia; Pregnancy,"fluorocarbon; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; adult; adverse event; child; child development; child health; drug effect; environmental exposure; female; fetus; human; maternal exposure; metabolism; placenta; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnancy outcome; prenatal exposure; Adult; Child; Child Development; Child Health; Diabetes, Gestational; Environmental Exposure; Female; Fetus; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Placenta; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects",Springer

The reaction regioselectivity is supported by the data of quantum-chemical calculations. Molecular and crystal structures of the obtained nitronyl nitroxides were solved by monocrystal X-ray diffraction analysis, and the nature of the radical was ascertained by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Heterospin complexes of Cu(hfac)2 with the synthesized quinoline-substituted nitronyl nitroxides were prepared. According to X-ray diffraction analysis, seven-membered metallocycles are formed in the complexes owing to simultaneous coordination of the nitroxyl and N-oxide groups by the Cu atom. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Fluorinated hetarenes; Nitronyl nitroxides; Nucleophilic substitution; X-ray diffraction analysis,,Elsevier B.V.
"Occurrence, fate, sources and toxicity of PFAS: What we know so far in Florida and major gaps","Cui D., Li X., Quinete N.",2020,TrAC - Trends in Analytical Chemistry,"Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants that have been the subject of several investigations worldwide due to their persistence and significant adverse health effects to humans and animals. In Florida, high PFAS levels have been detected in the ground water, surface water, soils and sediments near military bases, airports, and firefighting training facilities. Recently, a drinking water assessment conducted by the EWG has identified Miami, Florida as the U.S city with the third highest levels of PFAS among 44 locations assessed. This critical review presents a summary of the recent literature, databases, and investigations of PFAS contamination in Florida, focusing on PFAS occurrence, major sources and treatment methods. The major PFAS sources identified are divided into the usage of aqueous film forming foams (AFFF), landfills, and wastewater treatment plants. Despite the lack of comprehensive studies in Florida, toxicity concerns are also discussed.

Metagenomic analysis of soil microbial community under PFOA and PFOS stress,"Cai Y., Chen H., Yuan R., Wang F., Chen Z., Zhou B.",2020,Environmental Research,"Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) contamination of soil has attracted global attention in recent years but influences of PFCs on microorganisms in the soil environment have not been fully described. In this study, the effects of perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA) on bacterial communities were determined by Illumina Miseq sequencing and Illumina Hiseq Xten. The stimulation of PFCs pollutants on soil bacterial richness and community diversity were observed. Sequencing information indicated that Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Gemmatimonadetes were the dominant bacterial phyla. Two genera, Bacillus and Sphingomonas, exhibited adverse responses toward PFCs pollution. Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and NCBI databases were used to elucidate the proteins and function action of soil microbial to PFCs pollution. Pathways such as Carbohydrate metabolism, Global and overview maps and Membrane transport in the soil microbes were affected by PFCs stress. CAZy analysis revealed that glycosyl transferases (GTs) in PFCs-polluted soils showed more active, while glycoside hydrolases (GHs) were inhibited severely. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Illumina miseq sequencing; Microbial function; PFCs,glycosidase; glycosyltransferase; perfluoro compound; perfluoroctanoic acid; perfluorooctane sulphonate; RNA 16S; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; bacterium; carbohydrate; enzyme activity; metabolism; microbial community; protein; soil microorganism; soil pollution; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Article; Bacillus; carbohydrate metabolism; Chloroflexi; DNA extraction; Firmicutes; Gemmatimonadetes (phylum); gene sequence; genome analysis; membrane transport; metagenome; metagenomics; nonhuman; priority journal; Proteobacteria; RNA analysis; soil microflora; Sphingomonas; analysis; microbiology; microflora; soil; soil pollutant; toxicity; Kyoto [Kinki]; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Bacillus (bacterium); Bacteria (microorganisms); Chloroflexi; Chloroflexi (class); Firmicutes; Gemmatimonadetes; Proteobacteria; Sphingomonas; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Microbiota; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants,Academic Press Inc.
"Biomonitoring in firefighters for volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, persistent organic pollutants, and metals: A systematic review","Engelsman M., Toms L.-M.L., Banks A.P.W., Wang X., Mueller J.F.",2020,Environmental Research,"This systematic review examines biomonitoring studies that have assessed firefighter occupational exposure to chemicals due to combustion. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Firefighters are exposed to a wide range of toxic chemicals due to combustion, with numerous biomonitoring studies completed that have assessed exposure. Many of these studies focus on individual classes of chemicals, with a few considering a broad range of systemic exposures. As yet, no review process has been undertaken to comprehensively examine these studies. The aims of this review are to: (1) ascertain whether biomonitoring studies pertaining to firefighters demonstrate occupational exposure to volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, and metals; (2) determine and present results of biomonitoring studies; (3) provide any recommendations presented from the literature that may support exposure mitigation; and (4) suggest future study parameters that may assist in providing a greater understanding surrounding the occupational exposure of firefighters. A systematic review was undertaken with regards to firefighters and biomonitoring studies utilising the matrices of blood, urine, semen and breast milk. This yielded 5690 results. Following duplicate removal, inclusion and exclusion criteria screening and full text screening, 34 studies remained for review. Results of over 80% of studies analysed determined firefighters to experience occupational exposure. Results also show firefighters to be exposed to a wide range of toxic chemicals due to fire smoke; potentially exceeding the range of exposure of other occupations. As firefighters may face increased risk of health effects due to the additive, synergistic, and/or antagonistic effects of chemical exposure, all care must be taken to reduce exposure. This may be achieved by considering tactical decisions, increased personal hygiene, and thorough decontamination procedures. Future biomonitoring studies recognising and assessing the range of chemical exposure firefighters face would be beneficial. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Biomonitoring; Exposure; Fire fighters; Firefighting; Metals; Semi-volatile organic compounds; Volatile organic compounds,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; arsenic; beta hexachlorocyclohexane; butyl paraben; cadmium; ethyl paraben; flame retardant; hexachlorobenzene; hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene; insecticide; lead; manganese; mercury; metal; muconic acid; organic compound; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorododecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; propyl paraben; semivolatile organic compound; triclosan; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; metal; volatile organic compound; biomonitoring; chemical pollutant; combustion; health risk; metal; occupational exposure; persistent organic pollutant; toxic substance; volatile organic compound; Article; biological monitoring; dangerous goods; fire; fire fighter; human; limit of detection; male; nonhuman; occupational exposure; persistent organic pollutant; priority journal; skin absorption; systematic review; urine sampling; air pollutant; analysis; biological monitoring; environmental monitoring; female; occupational exposure; pollutant; toxicity; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Biological Monitoring; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Firefighters; Humans; Metals; Occupational Exposure; Volatile Organic Compounds",Academic Press Inc.
Polystyrene microplastics decrease F–53B bioaccumulation but induce inflammatory stress in larval zebrafish,"Yang H., Lai H., Huang J., Sun L., Mennigen J.A., Wang Q., Liu Y., Jin Y., Tu W.",2020,Chemosphere,"There is growing concern that microplastics (MPs), which act as carriers of other organic contaminants, are mistakenly ingested by aquatic organisms, consequently causing unpredictable adverse effects. In this study, zebrafish larvae (6 d post fertilization) were exposed to either 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F–53B), polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) or their combination for 7 d to evaluate the effects of the presence of PS-MPs on the bioaccumulation and immunomodulation of F–53B. PS-MPs greatly promoted the sorption of F–53B, which reduced the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of F–53B in zebrafish larvae. F–53B, PS-MPs, or their mixture significantly reduced the body weight of zebrafish larvae. Combined exposure of PS-MPs and F–53B resulted in a significant reduction in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lysozyme activity, indicating the occurrence of oxidative stress and inflammatory response in zebrafish larvae. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) was not affected by F–53B or PS-MPs, but significantly increased in their combined exposure. Furthermore, co-exposure of F–53B and PS-MPs significantly upregulated the transcripts of pro-inflammatory cxcl-clc and il-1β genes and increased the levels of iNOS protein in zebrafish larvae. In addition, enhanced protein expression of NF-κB paralleled the upregulation in the expression of most immune-related genes, suggesting NF-κB pathway was mechanistically involved in these responses. Collectively, the presence of MPs decreased F–53B bioaccumulation, but induced inflammatory stress in larval zebrafish. These findings highlight the health risks of co-contamination of MPs and F–53B in aquatic environments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",F-53B; Immune system; Oxidative stress; PS-MPs; Zebrafish,"Aquatic organisms; Bioaccumulation; Enzymes; Genes; Health risks; Microplastic; Polystyrenes; Aquatic environments; Immuno modulations; Inflammatory response; Organic contaminant; Post-fertilization; Protein expressions; Superoxide dismutases; Zebrafish larvae; Biochemistry; catalase; ether; glutathione peroxidase; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; immunoglobulin M; interleukin 1beta; lysozyme; malonaldehyde; microplastic; nitric oxide synthase; polystyrene; superoxide dismutase; 2-((6-chloro-1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6-dodecafluorohexyl)oxy)-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethanesulfonic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; malonaldehyde; polystyrene derivative; bioaccumulation; bioavailability; cyprinid; enzyme; enzyme activity; gene; gene expression; larva; plastic; protein; sorption; sulfonate; animal experiment; aquatic environment; Article; bioaccumulation; bioavailability; body weight; chlorination; chronic stress; clinical evaluation; developmental toxicity; fertilization; health hazard; immune response; immune-related gene; immunomodulation; inflammation; larva; nonhuman; oxidative stress; protein expression; systematic review; upregulation; zebra fish; animal; drug effect; immunology; metabolism; toxicity; water pollutant; Danio rerio; Alkanesulfonates; Animals; Bioaccumulation; Biological Availability; Larva; Malondialdehyde; Microplastics; Oxidative Stress; Polystyrenes; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish",Elsevier Ltd
A review of the influences of microplastics on toxicity and transgenerational effects of pharmaceutical and personal care products in aquatic environment,"Zhou R., Lu G., Yan Z., Jiang R., Bao X., Lu P.",2020,Science of the Total Environment,"PPCPs (pharmaceutical and personal care products) and microplastics (MPs) are two types of emerging pollutants that are ubiquitous and widely concerned in the environment. Both of them can accumulate in fish or aquatic invertebrates and transfer to offspring, thereby producing toxic effects on both parents and offspring, in which the characteristics of MPs also enable them to adsorb PPCPs thus producing carrier effects. In this study, we have conducted a comprehensive review of MPs and PPCPs and found that MPs can act as a carrier of PPCPs to influence the bioaccumulation of PPCPs. MPs and PPCPs have toxicity and transgenerational effects on both fish and aquatic invertebrates in many aspects, and MPs can also affect the toxicity and transgenerational effects of PPCPs due to their carrier effects. This paper revealed that MPs may have an important impact on the bioavailability of PPCPs and the interaction between MPs and PPCPs is a hot topic in future research. This study also puts forward the shortcomings of the current research and related suggestions, and relevant research should be carried out as soon as possible to provide the basis for the prevention and treatment of fresh water. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Carrier effect; Microplastics; Pharmaceutical and personal care products; Transgenerational effect,"Biochemistry; Fish; Microplastic; Water treatment; Aquatic environments; Aquatic invertebrates; Carrier effects; Emerging pollutants; Fresh Water; Microplastics; Pharmaceutical and personal care products; Toxic effect; Toxicity; chemical compound; drug; fresh water; microplastic; personal care product; unclassified drug; cosmetic; drug; aquatic ecosystem; bioaccumulation; chemical pollutant; invertebrate; PPCP; research work; toxicity; aquatic environment; aquatic species; bioaccumulation; bioavailability; biochemical composition; chemical analysis; chemical parameters; developmental toxicity; ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; fish; genotoxicity; gonad development; gonadal disease; human; invertebrate; nonhuman; physiological process; priority journal; progeny; reproductive toxicity; Review; toxicity testing; waste water management; water pollutant; animal; environmental monitoring; water pollutant; Invertebrata; Animals; Cosmetics; Environmental Monitoring; Microplastics; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier B.V.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and male reproductive health: a systematic review of the epidemiological evidence,"Petersen K.U., Larsen J.R., Deen L., Flachs E.M., Hærvig K.K., Hull S.D., Bonde J.P.E., Tøttenborg S.S.",2020,Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health - Part B: Critical Reviews,"Exposure to environmental pollutants may produce impairment of male reproductive health. The epidemiological literature evaluating potential consequences of human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has grown in recent years with concerns for both pre- and postnatal influences. The aim of this systematic review was to assess available evidence on associations between PFAS exposures in different stages of life and semen quality, reproductive hormones, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and testicular cancer. A systematic search of literature published prior to March 9th, 2020, was performed in the databases PubMed and Embase®. Predefined criteria for eligibility were applied by two authors screening study records independently. Among the 242 study records retrieved in the literature search, 26 studies were eligible for qualitative assessment. While several investigations suggested weak associations for single compounds and specific outcomes, a lack of consistency across studies limited conclusions of overall evidence. The current gap in knowledge is particularly obvious regarding exposures prior to adulthood, exposure to combinations of both PFAS and other types of environmental chemicals, and outcomes such as cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and testicular cancer. Continued efforts to clarify associations between PFAS exposure and male reproductive health through high-quality epidemiological studies are needed. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.",male reproduction; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS); reproductive hormones; semen quality; systematic review,hormone; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; fluorocarbon; sex hormone; clinical outcome; cryptorchism; disease association; human; hypospadias; male; reproductive health; reproductive toxicity; Review; sperm quality; systematic review; testis cancer; adverse event; drug effect; environmental exposure; metabolism; pollutant; reproductive health; sperm; testis tumor; toxicity; Cryptorchidism; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Humans; Hypospadias; Male; Reproductive Health; Semen; Testicular Neoplasms,Taylor and Francis Inc.

A critical review on recent proton exchange membranes applied in microbial fuel cells for renewable energy recovery,"Shabani M., Younesi H., Pontié M., Rahimpour A., Rahimnejad M., Zinatizadeh A.A.",2020,Journal of Cleaner Production,"This paper proposes a critical review of the proton exchange membranes currently available or under development for use in batch-mode microbial fuel cell (MFC) systems in order to suggest a suitable cost-effective membrane in terms of energy recovery. To prepare the present review, the relevant papers were identified by searching the Scopus database and extracting papers from 2007 to 2020. There is a wide variety of different membranes, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Perfluorinated and non-fluorinated membranes were evaluated based on different properties, including proton conductivity, power density (PD), water uptake, and ion exchange capacity. Results reveal that non-fluorinated membranes such as sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK), graphene oxide/SPEEK (GO/SPEEK), polyethersulfone (PES) and polysulfone (PS) and sulfonated polybenzimidazole (S-OPBI) are a good choice to replace the commonly used membrane Nafion™ because of their lower cost and higher energy recovery. Sulfonated membranes such as polyethersulfone/SPEEK (PES/SPEEK) and Sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES) show the highest normalized energy recovery. Although Nafion™ has the highest proton conductivity and is an excellent choice as proton exchange membrane (PEM) for MFCs, its energy recovery capacity is lower than that of porous and microfiltration membranes. It can also be very sensitive to biofouling. In the following, different parameters of membrane characterization and also wastewater treatment are discussed. The energy recovery of the membranes and systems studied was measured in order to recommend a suitable membrane for MFCs to improve the efficiency of these systems in terms of clean electricity generation and wastewater treatment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Cost-effective membrane; Energy recovery; MFC; Perfluorinated and non-fluorinated membranes,Cost effectiveness; Ethers; Graphene; Ion exchange; Ion exchange membranes; Ketones; Membranes; Microbial fuel cells; Microfiltration; Molecular biology; Proton conductivity; Recovery; Wastewater treatment; Membrane characterization; Micro-filtration membranes; Non-fluorinated membranes; Proton exchange membranes; Proton-exchange membrane; Sulfonated polybenzimidazole; Sulfonated polyetheretherketone; Sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES); Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC),Elsevier Ltd
In silico co-factor balance estimation using constraint-based modelling informs metabolic engineering in Escherichia coli,"de Arroyo Garcia L., Jones P.R.",2020,PLoS Computational Biology,"In the growing field of metabolic engineering, where cells are treated as ‘factories’ that synthesize industrial compounds, it is essential to consider the ability of the cells’ native metabolism to accommodate the demands of synthetic pathways, as these pathways will alter the homeostasis of cellular energy and electron metabolism. From the breakdown of substrate, microorganisms activate and reduce key co-factors such as ATP and NAD(P)H, which subsequently need to be hydrolysed and oxidized, respectively, in order to restore cellular balance. A balanced supply and consumption of such co-factors, here termed co-factor balance, will influence biotechnological performance. To aid the strain selection and design process, we used stoichiometric modelling (FBA, pFBA, FVA and MOMA) and the Escherichia coli (E.coli) core stoichiometric model to investigate the network-wide effect of butanol and butanol precursor production pathways differing in energy and electron demand on product yield. An FBA-based co-factor balance assessment (CBA) algorithm was developed to track and categorise how ATP and NAD(P)H pools are affected in the presence of a new pathway. CBA was compared to the balance calculations proposed by Dugar et al. (Nature Biotechnol. 29 (12), 1074–1078). Predicted solutions were compromised by excessively underdetermined systems, displaying greater flexibility in the range of reaction fluxes than experimentally measured by 13C-metabolic flux analysis (MFA) and the appearance of unrealistic futile co-factor cycles. With the assumption that futile cycles are tightly regulated in reality, the FBA models were manually constrained in a step-wise manner. Solutions with minimal futile cycling diverted surplus energy and electrons towards biomass formation. As an alternative, the use of loopless FBA or constraining the models with measured flux ranges were tried but did not prevent futile co-factor cycles. The results highlight the need to account for co-factor imbalance and confirm that better-balanced pathways with minimal diversion of surplus towards biomass formation present the highest theoretical yield. The analysis also suggests that ATP and NAD(P)H balancing cannot be assessed in isolation from each other, or even from the balance of additional co-factors such as AMP and ADP. We conclude that, through revealing the source of co-factor imbalance CBA can facilitate pathway and host selection when designing new biocatalysts for implementation by metabolic engineering.

Disposable and low-cost electrode based on graphene paper-nafion-bi nanostructures for ultra-trace determination of pb(II) and cd(II),"Scandurra A., Ruffino F., Urso M., Grimaldi M.G., Mirabella S.",2020,Nanomaterials,"There is a huge demand for rapid, reliable and low-cost methods for the analysis of heavy metals in drinking water, particularly in the range of sub-part per billion (ppb). In the present work, we describe the preparation, characterization and analytical performance of the disposable sensor to be employed in Square Wave Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (SWASV) for ultra-trace simultaneous determination of cadmium and lead. The electrode consists of graphene paper-perfluorosulfonic ionomer-bismuth nano-composite material. The electrode preparation implies a key step aimed to enhance the Bi3+ adsorption into nafion film, prior to the bismuth electro-deposition. Finely dispersed bismuth nanoparticles embedded in the ionomer film are obtained. The electrode was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The electrode shows a linear response in the 5–100 ppb range, a time-stability tested up to almost three months, and detection limits up to 0.1 ppb for both Pb2+ and Cd2+. The electrode preparation method is simple and low in cost and the obtained analytical performance is very competitive with the state of art for the SWASV determination of Pb2+ and Cd2+ in solution. © 2020 by the authors.

Poly‐and perfluoroalkyl substances in water and wastewater: A comprehensive review from sources to remediation,"Phong Vo H.N., Ngo H.H., Guo W., Hong Nguyen T.M., Li J., Liang H., Deng L., Chen Z., Hang Nguyen T.A.",2020,Journal of Water Process Engineering,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are pollutants have attracted major concern due to their high persistence and bioaccumulation. They are causing increasingly serious epidemiological problems in many communities globally due to consuming PFAS-contaminated water sources. Necessarily, the behavior of PFAS in water and wastewater needs to be understood better. This study attempts to comprehensively review, analyze and discuss PFAS based on the following key aspects: (i) sources, (ii) occurrence in water and wastewater, (iii) transformation, fate and migration, and (iv) remediation technologies. Studies indicated that modern water and wastewater treatment plants cannot deal completely with PFAS and in some cases, the removal efficiency is minus -3500-fold. The main reasons are the high hydrophobicity of PFAS and presence of PFAS precursors. Precursors can account for 33–63% of total PFAS concentration in water and wastewater. Detection and identification of precursors are challenging due to the requirement of advanced analytical instrument and standard chemicals. Several technologies have been developed for PFAS remediation involving two main mechanisms: separation-concentration and destruction. The most widespread in-use technology is adsorption because it is reasonably affordable. Anion exchange resin and synthesized materials are the most effective sorbents having a sorption capacity of 100–2000 mg PFAS/g sorbent, effective within a few hours. The destruction technology such as plasma can also be a promising one for degrading PFAS to below health-based standard in 1 min. However, plasma is costly and not yet ready for full scale application. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Fate; Occurrence; Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances; Precursors; Remediation,,Elsevier Ltd
Environmental exposures and breast cancer risk in the context of underlying susceptibility: A systematic review of the epidemiological literature,"Zeinomar N., Oskar S., Kehm R.D., Sahebzeda S., Terry M.B.",2020,Environmental Research,"Background: The evidence evaluating environmental chemical exposures (ECE) and breast cancer (BC) risk is heterogeneous which may stem in part as few studies measure ECE during key BC windows of susceptibility (WOS). Another possibility may be that most BC studies are skewed towards individuals at average risk, which may limit the ability to detect signals from ECE. Objectives: We reviewed the literature on ECE and BC focusing on three types of studies or subgroup analyses based on higher absolute BC risk: BC family history (Type 1); early onset BC (Type 2); and/or genetic susceptibility (Type 3). Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed database to identify epidemiologic studies examining ECE and BC risk published through June 1, 2019. Results: We identified 100 publications in 56 unique epidemiologic studies. Of these 56 studies, only 2 (3.6%) were enriched with BC family history and only 11% of studies (6/56) were specifically enriched with early onset cases. 80% of the publications from these 8 enriched studies (Type 1: 8/10 publications; Type 2: 8/10 publications) supported a statistically significant association between ECE and BC risk including studies of PAH, indoor cooking, NO2, DDT; PCBs, PFOSA; metals; personal care products; and occupational exposure to industrial dyes. 74% of Type 3 publications (20/27) supported statistically significant associations for PAHs, traffic-related air pollution, PCBs, phthalates, and PFOSAs in subgroups of women with greater genetic susceptibility due to variants in carcinogen metabolism, DNA repair, oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis and tumor suppressor genes. Discussion: Studies enriched for women at higher BC risk through family history, younger age of onset and/or genetic susceptibility consistently support an association between an ECE and BC risk. In addition to measuring exposures during WOS, designing studies that are enriched with women at higher absolute risk are necessary to robustly measure the role of ECE on BC risk. © 2020 The Authors",Breast cancer; Early onset breast cancer; Environmental contaminants; Family history; Gene-environment interaction,cancer; carcinogen; epidemiology; gene expression; health risk; literature review; pollution exposure; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; breast tumor; cooking; environmental exposure; female; human; Breast Neoplasms; Cooking; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons,Academic Press Inc.
"Intranasal delivery of topiramate nanoemulsion: Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and brain uptake studies","Patel R.J., Parikh R.H.",2020,International Journal of Pharmaceutics,"Epilepsy is the noncommunicable and chronic central nervous system disorder characterized by frequent, unprovoked seizures, or electrical disturbances in the brain. Topiramate is used as an antiepileptic drug for the treatment of partial onset seizures, generalized seizures and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Topiramate, a BCS class II drug, has a relatively low bioavailability. It is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein and Blood Brain Barrier restricts its entry into the brain. This investigation was aimed to prepare O/W nanoemulsion delivery system of topiramate to improve its brain bioavailability. Topiramate loaded nanoemulsion was prepared by phase titration method. It was consisting of 2% w/w Capmul MCM C8, 32% w/w Tween 20:Carbitol (2:1) and 66% w/w water. It was characterized for globule size, viscosity, polydispersibility index, zeta potential, pH, conductivity values, transmittance and TEM. Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and brain drug uptake study was carried out using wistar albino rats post intranasal and oral administration. Topiramate loaded nanoemulsion was having a globule size of 4.73 ± 0.52 nm. It was stable for six months. Brain uptake of topiramate post intranasal administration of topiramate loaded nanoemulsion was significantly (P &lt; 1.86 × 10−8) higher when it was compared with oral administration of topiramate loaded nanoemulsion. This study indicates that intranasal administration of topiramate containing nanoemulsion could be an encouraging approach for the treatment of epilepsy to minimize the dose of topiramate in direction to avoid dose related adverse events. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Brain Drug Uptake Study; Intranasal Delivery; Nanoemulsion; Pharmacodynamic Study; Pharmacokinetic Study; Topiramate,"topiramate; anticonvulsive agent; nanoparticle; topiramate; animal model; Article; blood brain barrier; conductance; controlled study; drug bioavailability; drug uptake; epilepsy; febrile convulsion; female; male; nanoemulsion; nonhuman; pH; priority journal; rat; seizure; surface area; systematic review; thermodynamics; viscosity; zeta potential; animal; brain; drug delivery system; drug effect; emulsion; intranasal drug administration; metabolism; procedures; Wistar rat; Administration, Intranasal; Animals; Anticonvulsants; Brain; Drug Delivery Systems; Emulsions; Female; Male; Nanoparticles; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Topiramate",Elsevier B.V.
Decanoic Acid and Not Octanoic Acid Stimulates Fatty Acid Synthesis in U87MG Glioblastoma Cells: A Metabolomics Study,"Damiano F., De Benedetto G.E., Longo S., Giannotti L., Fico D., Siculella L., Giudetti A.M.",2020,Frontiers in Neuroscience,"Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are dietary components with a chain length ranging from 6 to 12 carbon atoms. MCFA can cross the blood-brain barrier and in the brain can be oxidized through mitochondrial β-oxidation. As components of ketogenic diets, MCFA have demonstrated beneficial effects on different brain diseases, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer’s disease, drug-resistant epilepsy, diabetes, and cancer. Despite the interest in MCFA effects, not much information is available about MCFA metabolism in the brain. In this study, with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics approach, coupled with multivariate data analyses, we followed the metabolic changes of U87MG glioblastoma cells after the addition of octanoic (C8), or decanoic (C10) acids for 24 h. Our analysis highlighted significant differences in the metabolism of U87MG cells after the addition of C8 or C10 and identified several metabolites whose amount changed between the two groups of treated cells. Overall, metabolic pathway analyses suggested the citric acid cycle, Warburg effect, glutamine/glutamate metabolism, and ketone body metabolism as pathways influenced by C8 or C10 addition to U87MG cells. Our data demonstrated that, while C8 affected mitochondrial metabolism resulting in increased ketone body production, C10 mainly influenced cytosolic pathways by stimulating fatty acid synthesis. Moreover, glutamine might be the main substrate to support fatty acids synthesis in C10-treated cells. In conclusion, we identified a metabolic signature associated with C8 or C10 addition to U87MG cells that can be used to decipher metabolic responses of glioblastoma cells to MCFA treatment. © Copyright © 2020 Damiano, De Benedetto, Longo, Giannotti, Fico, Siculella and Giudetti.",citric acid cycle; decanoic acid; lipid synthesis; metabolomics; octanoic acid,decanoic acid; glutamic acid; glutamine; ketone body; octanoic acid; amino acid metabolism; Article; cell metabolism; citric acid cycle; controlled study; cytosol; drug mechanism; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid synthesis; glioma cell line; mass fragmentography; metabolomics; mitochondrial respiration; U87MG cell line,Frontiers Media S.A.
"Emerging pollutants (EPs) in Latin América: A critical review of under-studied EPs, case of study -Nonylphenol-","Vargas-Berrones K., Bernal-Jácome L., Díaz de León-Martínez L., Flores-Ramírez R.",2020,Science of the Total Environment,"Emerging contaminants (EPs) represent a significant risk to human, ecological and environmental health. Although progress has been made in establishing monitoring in environmental matrices, health effects, legislation and control, there are still problems associated with regional bias and the types of EPs commonly assessed, which may underestimate the risk to health. In Latin America there are limited reports on environmental monitoring of EPs and it is generally focused on wastewater. This review identifies the current research deficiencies for emerging contaminants in the Latin American region, and we address the case of nonylphenol as an under-studied EP in the region. Nonylphenol is a degradation product of nonylphenol ethoxylate, which is a surfactant widely used in the manufacture of detergents in Latin America, environmental concentrations have been reported, predominantly in water, and the possible effects on species in this region have been also described. The importance of the review of this compound in the region lies in the fact that the Rotterdam Convention has catalogued nonylphenol as a severely restricted compound, so it is necessary to establish measures for its restriction and change to a sustainable technology. Finally, the example of NP presented in this review highlights the lack of regulation in Latin America regarding to EPs, resulting in the contamination of wastewater, effluents, rivers and drinking water. It is imperative to determine the potential effects, occurrence and concentration levels to improve the regulation of these pollutants in a timely manner. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Ecological risk; Emerging pollutants; Human risk; Latin America; Nonylphenol,Degradation; Health; Health risks; Laws and legislation; Phenols; Pollution; Potable water; Risk assessment; Soaps (detergents); Water treatment; Concentration levels; Degradation products; Environmental concentration; Environmental health; Environmental matrixes; Environmental Monitoring; Nonylphenol ethoxylates; Sustainable technology; Effluents; drinking water; nonylphenol; environmental risk; health impact; health risk; literature review; medical geography; phenol; public health; chemical structure; concentration (parameter); degradation; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; health hazard; health impact assessment; human; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; South and Central America; waste water; water pollution; water supply; Latin America,Elsevier B.V.
Application of a fluorous derivatization method for characterization of glutathione-trapped reactive metabolites with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis,"Nishijo N., Hayama T., Tomita R., Yamaguchi M., Fujioka T.",2020,Journal of Chromatography A,"The glutathione (GSH) trapping assay is commonly utilized for the screening and characterization of reactive metabolites produced by drug metabolism. This study describes a fluorous derivatization method for a more sensitive and selective analysis of reactive metabolites trapped by GSH using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). In this study, the GSH-trapped reactive metabolites, which were obtained after incubation of the test compounds with human liver microsome (HLM) in the presence of GSH and NADPH, were derivatized using the perfluoroalkylamine reagent through oxazolone chemistry. Since this reaction enabled the selective modification of the α-carboxyl group in GSH, the structural compositions of the metabolites were not affected by the derivatization. Furthermore, the selective analysis of the resulting derivatives could be performed using perfluoroalkyl-modified stationary phase LC separation via the interaction between the perfluoroalkyl-containing compounds, such as fluorous affinity, followed by detection with the precursor ion and/or enhanced product ion scan modes in MS/MS. Finally, we demonstrated the applicability of this method by analyzing perfluoroalkyl derivatives of some drug metabolites trapped by GSH in HLM incubation. © 2020",Fluorous derivatization; Glutathione; LC–MS/MS; Oxazolone chemistry; Reactive metabolite,"Biomolecules; Chemical reactions; Liquid chromatography; Liver; Mass spectrometry; Peptides; Derivatization method; Human liver microsomes; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Perfluoroalkyl derivatives; Reactive metabolites; Selective modification; Structural composition; Tandem mass spectrometry; Metabolites; carboxyl group; fluorine; glutathione; oxazolone; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; drug; glutathione; Article; chemical composition; chemical modification; chemical structure; chemistry; controlled study; derivatization; human; human cell; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liver microsome; metabolite; priority journal; reaction analysis; separation technique; chemistry; liquid chromatography; metabolism; procedures; tandem mass spectrometry; Chromatography, Liquid; Fluorine; Glutathione; Humans; Microsomes, Liver; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Elsevier B.V.
Adsorptive removal of trace thallium(I) from wastewater: A review and new perspectives,"Zhao Z., Xiong Y., Cheng X., Hou X., Yang Y., Tian Y., You J., Xu L.",2020,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"Thallium is an emerging pollutant reported in wastewater along with the increasing mining and smelting of thallium-containing ores in recent years. The complete removal of Tl(I) from wastewater is of significant emergency due to its high toxicity and mobility, however, Tl(I) removal is always confronted with numerous technical difficulties because of the extremely low Tl(I) concentration in wastewater and the disturbances of many accompanying impurity ions. Adsorption is currently the most widely used method for Tl(I) removal on industrial scale and varied kinds of adsorbents such as Prussian blue analogues, biosorbents, and metal oxides have been developed. However, the adsorption process of Tl(I) is always affected by the co-existing cations, resulting in low Tl(I) removal efficiency. Recently, the development of a variety of novel adsorbents or ion sensors based on macrocyclic compounds for enrichment and accurate determination of trace Tl(I) in aqueous solutions exhibits great potential for application in Tl(I) removal from wastewater with high selectivity and process efficiency. This paper provides an overview of the adsorption methods for Tl(I) removal from wastewater with emphasis on complexation properties between varied types of adsorbents and Tl(I). Future directions of research and development of adsorptive Tl(I) removal from industrial wastewater are proposed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Adsorption; Macrocyclic compounds; Technology overview; Thallium removal; Wastewater,Adsorption; Efficiency; Industrial research; Macromolecules; Removal; Research and development management; Smelting; Wastewater; Complexation properties; Emerging pollutants; Industrial wastewaters; Macrocyclic compounds; Prussian blue analogues; Removal efficiencies; Research and development; Technical difficulties; Thallium compounds; activated carbon; adsorbent; aluminum oxide; base; crown ether; ferric ferrocyanide; iron oxide; macrocyclic compound; manganese dioxide; metal oxide; thallium; titanium dioxide; adsorption; complexation; mining industry; pollutant removal; research and development; smelting; technological development; thallium; wastewater treatment; adsorption; complex formation; heavy metal removal; Review; stereospecificity; surface property; waste water management,Elsevier B.V.
Recent developments of PFAS-detecting sensors and future direction: A review,"Rodriguez K.L., Hwang J.-H., Esfahani A.R., Sadmani A.H.M.A., Lee W.H.",2020,Micromachines,"Per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have recently been labeled as toxic constituents that exist in many aqueous environments. However, traditional methods used to determine the level of PFASs are often not appropriate for continuous environmental monitoring and management. Based on the current state of research, PFAS-detecting sensors have surfaced as a promising method of determination. These sensors are an innovative solution with characteristics that allow for in situ, low-cost, and easy-to-use capabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent developments in PFAS-detecting sensors, and why the literature on determination methods has shifted in this direction compared to the traditional methods used. PFAS-detecting sensors discussed herein are primarily categorized in terms of the detection mechanism used. The topics covered also include the current limitations, as well as insight on the future direction of PFAS analyses. This paper is expected to be useful for the smart sensing technology development of PFAS detection methods and the associated environmental management best practices in smart cities of the future. © 2020 by the authors.",Per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs); PFAS detection sensor; Smart cities; Smart sensing technology,Environmental technology; Aqueous environment; Current limitation; Detection mechanism; Determination methods; Environmental Monitoring; Innovative solutions; Smart-sensing technology; State of research; Environmental management,MDPI AG
Intestinal environmental disorders associate with the tissue damages induced by perfluorooctane sulfonate exposure,"Wang G., Sun S., Wu X., Yang S., Wu Y., Zhao J., Zhang H., Chen W.",2020,Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a recently identified and persistent organic pollutant that becomes enriched in living organisms via bioaccumulation and the food chain. PFOS can induce various disorders, including liver toxicity, neurotoxicity and metabolic dysregulation. Most recent studies have shown a close association of the gut microbiota with the occurrence of diseases. However, few studies have explored the effects of PFOS on the gut environment, including the intestinal flora and barrier. In this study, we evaluated the effects of PFOS in C57BL/6J male mice and explored the relationship between tissue damage and the gut environment. Mice were orally exposed to PFOS for 16 days. Liver damage was assessed by examining the inflammatory reaction in the liver and serum liver enzyme concentrations. Metabolic function was assessed by the hepatic cholesterol level and the serum concentrations of glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides. Intestinal environmental disorders were assessed by evaluating the gut microbiota, SCFAs production, inflammatory reactions and intestinal tight junction protein expression. Our results indicated that PFOS affected inflammatory reactions in the liver and colon and promoted the development of metabolic disorders (especially of cholesterol and glucose metabolism). Moreover, PFOS dysregulated various populations in the gut microbiota (e.g., Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Clostridiales, Enterobacteriales, Lactobacillales, Erysipelotrichaceae, Rikenellaceae, Ruminococcaceae and Blautia) and induced a loss of gut barrier integrity by reducing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production and intestinal tight junction protein expression. A Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis mainly identified metabolic pathways (e.g., the adipocytokine signalling pathway), endocrine system pathways (e.g., steroid hormone biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis), the latter of which is widely considered to be associated with metabolism. Overall, our results suggest that PFOS damages various aspects of the gut environment, including the microbiota, SCFAs and barrier function, and thereby exacerbates the toxicity associated with liver, gut and metabolic disorders. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Gut barrier; Gut microbiota; Inflammation; PFOS; Short-chain fatty acid; Tight junction,"acetic acid; adipocytokine; alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; bacterial DNA; biological marker; catalase; cholesterol 7alpha monooxygenase; claudin 1; flavonoid; gamma glutamyltransferase; glucose; glutathione; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; malonaldehyde; messenger RNA; occludin; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; protein ZO1; short chain fatty acid; steroid hormone; superoxide dismutase; tight junction protein; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; valeric acid; alkanesulfonic acid; cholesterol; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; volatile fatty acid; bioaccumulation; cell; microbial activity; persistent organic pollutant; pollution exposure; surfactant; Absidia; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alkaline phosphatase blood level; anatomical concepts; animal behavior; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; Bacteroides; bile acid synthesis; Blautia; body weight gain; body weight loss; cell degeneration; cell enlargement; cell infiltration; cell swelling; cholesterol blood level; cholesterol liver level; cholesterol metabolism; cholesterol transport; Clostridiales; colitis; controlled study; edema; Enterobacteriales; enteropathy; environmental disease; environmental exposure; enzyme activity; Erysipelotrichaceae; fatty acid synthesis; feces analysis; Firmicutes; food intake; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; Gammaproteobacteria; gene expression; glucose blood level; glucose metabolism; gut barrier; hepatic nucleus shrinkage; hepatocytic degeneration; hepatocytic edema; hepatomegaly; histopathology; immune deficiency; inflammatory cell; intestine flora; kidney mass; Lactobacillales; lipid degradation; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; liver cell; liver protection; liver weight; locomotion; male; metabolic disorder; mouse; nonhuman; nucleus migration; oxidative stress; persistent organic pollutant; phylogeny; population abundance; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; Proteobacteria; Rikenellaceae; Ruminococcaceae; signal transduction; spleen atrophy; spleen disease; spleen weight; steroidogenesis; tight junction; tissue distribution; tissue injury; toxic hepatitis; trend study; triacylglycerol blood level; adverse event; animal; C57BL mouse; dietary exposure; drug effect; inflammation; intestine; liver; metabolism; microbiology; pathology; pollutant; toxicity; Bacteroides; Clostridiales; Enterobacteriales; Erysipelotrichaceae; Firmicutes; Gammaproteobacteria; Lactobacillales; Mus; Proteobacteria; Rikenellaceae; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Blood Glucose; Cholesterol; Dietary Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Fluorocarbons; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Inflammation; Intestines; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL",Academic Press
Placenta Disrupted: Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals and Pregnancy,"Gingrich J., Ticiani E., Veiga-Lopez A.",2020,Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism,"Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are chemicals that can interfere with normal endocrine signals. Human exposure to EDCs is particularly concerning during vulnerable periods of life, such as pregnancy. However, often overlooked is the effect that EDCs may pose to the placenta. The abundance of hormone receptors makes the placenta highly sensitive to EDCs. We have reviewed the most recent advances in our understanding of EDC exposures on the development and function of the placenta such as steroidogenesis, spiral artery remodeling, drug-transporter expression, implantation and cellular invasion, fusion, and proliferation. EDCs reviewed include those ubiquitous in the environment with available human biomonitoring data.

Macular optical coherence tomography findings after vitreoretinal surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment,"Coppola M., Marchese A., Cicinelli M.V., Rabiolo A., Giuffrè C., Gomarasca S., Querques G., Bandello F.",2020,European Journal of Ophthalmology,"The primary aim of this study was to summarize and illustrate the main structural cross-sectional optical coherence tomography findings encountered after vitreoretinal surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. This was a non-systematic review of literature on structural cross-sectional optical coherence tomography findings after vitreoretinal surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Adequate illustrations of the main findings described were found after a retrospective analysis of imaging and charts of patients operated at the department where this study was performed. The main structural cross-sectional optical coherence tomography findings after vitreoretinal surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment included persistent subretinal fluid, subretinal blebs, retinal folds, subretinal perfluorocarbon liquids, macular alterations related to silicone oil, epiretinal membranes, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, cystoid macular edema, macular holes, and recurrent retinal detachment. In conclusion, optical coherence tomography was a useful tool after vitreoretinal surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Some optical coherence tomography findings may not be evident on fundus examination, and optical coherence tomography can reveal essential details for the clinical management and the visual prognosis. Other findings, despite being visible on funduscopic examination, may be better assessed with the aid of optical coherence tomography. All these elements contribute to support the importance of tomographic assessment in the follow-up of eyes treated for vitreoretinal conditions. © The Author(s) 2020.",optical coherence tomography; pars plana vitrectomy; retina; retinal breaks; Retinal detachment; techniques of retinal examination; vitreous,"fluorocarbon; ranibizumab; best corrected visual acuity; chorioretinopathy; epiretinal membrane; fluorescence angiography; follow up; human; laser coagulation; macular edema; optical coherence tomography; priority journal; retina detachment; retina fold; retina macula cystoid edema; retina macula hole; retinal ganglion cell layer; Review; scanning laser ophthalmoscopy; subretinal fluid; visual acuity; vitreoretinal surgery; vitreoretinopathy; vitreous body detachment; diagnostic imaging; female; male; procedures; retina detachment; vitrectomy; Female; Humans; Male; Retinal Detachment; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Vitrectomy; Vitreoretinal Surgery",SAGE Publications Ltd

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and anthropometric measures of obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Ribeiro C.M., Beserra B.T.S., Silva N.G., Lima C.L., Rocha P.R.S., Coelho M.S., Neves F.D.A.R., Amato A.A.",2020,BMJ Open,"Objective Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are viewed as a major potential link between the environment and obesity development. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between exposure to EDCs and obesity. Data sources, design and eligibility criteria PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched from inception to 6 June 2018 for studies primarily addressing the association between exposure to EDCs after the age of 2 years and anthropometric measures of obesity or body fat. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias. Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers screened and conducted data extraction and synthesis. A third reviewer resolved disagreements. Results A total of 73 studies investigating bisphenol A (32 286 individuals), organochlorine compounds (34 567 individuals), phthalates (21 401 individuals), polybrominated biphenyls (2937 individuals), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (5174 individuals), parabens (4097 individuals), benzoic acid (3671 individuals) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (349 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Most had a cross-sectional design and low or medium risk of bias. In qualitative analysis, bisphenol A and phthalates were consistently associated with general and abdominal obesity, in children and adults, and some studies suggested this association was age-dependent and gender-dependent. Meta-analysis indicated a significant association between exposure to bisphenol A and overweight (OR 1.254, 95% CI 1.005 to 1.564), obesity (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.273 to 1.774) and increased waist circumference (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.267 to 1.783) in adults, and between exposure to 2,5-dichlorophenol and obesity in children (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1018 to 3.184). Conclusion Most observational studies supported a positive association between obesity and exposure to EDCs. Although causality cannot be determined from these data, they underscore the need to limit human exposure to EDCs in light of the evidence from animal and cell-based studies indicating the effects of these chemicals on adiposity.

Worldwide bottled water occurrence of emerging contaminants: A review of the recent scientific literature,"Akhbarizadeh R., Dobaradaran S., Schmidt T.C., Nabipour I., Spitz J.",2020,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) have recently been detected in bottled water and have brought about discussions on possible risks for human health. However, a systematic review of CECs in bottled water is currently lacking due to the relatively new introduction and/or detection of these pollutants. Hence, this paper reviews the existing studies on the presence of six major groups of emerging contaminants including microplastics (MPs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, alkylphenols (APs), and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in bottled water from different countries. Also, the findings related to CECs’ levels, their possible sources, and their risks are summarized. The gathered data indicate that MPs within the size range of 1−5 μm are the most predominant and potentially toxic classes of MPs in bottled water. In addition, PPCPs, PFASs, APs, and BPA occur in concentration levels of ng/L, while phthalates occur in the μg/L level in bottled water. The bottle type plays an important role in the contamination level. As expected, water in plastic bottles with plastic caps is more polluted than in glass bottles. However, other sources of contamination such as contact materials during cleaning, bottling, and storage are not negligible. Based on the gathered data in this review, the CEC levels except for MPs (no threshold values) in bottled water of most countries do not raise a safety concern for the human. However, the occurrence of individual CECs and their association in bottled water need more accurate data to understand their own/synergistic effects on human health. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Alkylphenols; Bisphenol A; Microplastics; Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances; Pharmaceuticals and personal care products; Phthalates,"Contamination; Digital storage; Esters; Glass bottles; Health risks; Microplastic; Phenols; Plastic bottles; Pollution detection; Alkylphenols; Bis-phenol a; Microplastics; Pharmaceuticals and personal care products; Phthalates; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Water pollution; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; alkylphenol; industrial chemical; microplastic; perfluoroalkyl substance; phthalic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; drinking water; accuracy assessment; phenol; phthalate; plastic; PPCP; safety; Review; water contamination; environmental monitoring; water pollutant; Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier B.V.
A Narrative and Critical Review of Randomized-Controlled Clinical Trials on Patent Foramen Ovale Closure for Reducing the Risk of Stroke Recurrence,"Safouris A., Kargiotis O., Psychogios K., Kalyvas P., Ikonomidis I., Drakopoulou M., Toutouzas K., Tsivgoulis G.",2020,Frontiers in Neurology,"Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a common cardiac anatomic variant that has been increasingly found in young (<60 years) cryptogenic stroke patients. Despite initial neutral randomized-controlled clinical trials (RCTs), there have been four recent RCTs providing consistent data in favor of the efficacy and safety of PFO closure compared to medical therapy for secondary stroke prevention. However, taking into consideration the high prevalence of PFO, the low risk of stroke recurrence under medical treatment and the uncommon yet severe adverse events of the intervention, patient selection is crucial for attaining meaningful clinical benefits. Thorough workup to exclude alternative causes of stroke and identification of high-risk PFOs through clinical, neuroimaging and echocardiographic criteria are essential. Cost effectiveness of the procedure cannot be proven for the time being, since there are no robust data on clinical outcome after PFO-associated stroke but only limited anecdotal data suggesting low risk for long-term disability. © Copyright © 2020 Safouris, Kargiotis, Psychogios, Kalyvas, Ikonomidis, Drakopoulou, Toutouzas and Tsivgoulis.",cryptogenic; patent foramen oval; PFO closure; randomized controlled (clinical) trial; stroke,anticoagulant agent; anticoagulant therapy; atherosclerosis; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular accident; clinical outcome; comparative study; cost effectiveness analysis; disease association; human; meta analysis (topic); paradoxical embolism; patent foramen ovale; patient selection; practice guideline; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent disease; Review; risk reduction; scoring system; systematic review,Frontiers Media S.A.
Update on pollen-food allergy syndrome,"Poncet P., Sénéchal H., Charpin D.",2020,Expert Review of Clinical Immunology,"Introduction: Allergies affect 20-30% of the population and respiratory allergies are mostly due to pollen grains from anemophilous plants. One to 5% of people suffer from food allergies and clinicians report increasing numbers of pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS), such that the symptoms have broadened from respiratory to gastrointestinal, and even to anaphylactic shock in the presence of cofactors. Thirty to 60% of food allergies are associated with pollen allergy while the percentage of pollen allergies associated to food allergy varies according to local environment and dietary habits Areas covered: Articles published in peer-reviewed journals, covered by PubMed databank, clinical data are discussed including symptoms, diagnosis, and management. A chapter emphasizes the role of six well-known allergen families involved in PFAS: PR10 proteins, profilins, lipid transfer proteins, thaumatin-like proteins, isoflavone reductases, and β-1,3 glucanases. The relevance in PFAS of three supplementary allergen families is presented: oleosins, polygalacturonases, and gibberellin-regulated proteins. To support the discussion a few original relevant results were added. Expert opinion: Both allergenic sources, pollen and food, are submitted to the same stressful environmental changes resulting in an increase of pathogenesis-related proteins in which numerous allergens are found. This might be responsible for the potential increase of PFAS. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","gibberellin-regulated proteins; isoflavone reductase; lipid transfer protein; oleosin; Pollen-food allergy syndrome; polygalacturonase; PR-10; profilin; thaumatin-like protein; β-1,3 glucanase","1,3 beta glucanase; antihistaminic agent; bet v 1 like protein; glycosylated protein; isoflavone reductase; lipid transfer protein; oleosin; polygalacturonase; profilin; snakin gibberellin regulated protein; thaumatin; thaumatin like protein; unclassified drug; allergen; plant protein; clinical examination; cross reaction; desensitization; food allergy; human; pathogenesis; pollen allergy; prevalence; prick test; protein family; Review; systematic review; food allergy; immunology; pollen; pollen allergy; syndrome; Allergens; Cross Reactions; Food Hypersensitivity; Humans; Plant Proteins; Pollen; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal; Syndrome",Taylor and Francis Ltd
Impact of enhanced recovery after surgery or fast track surgery pathways in minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Lv Z., Cai Y., Jiang H., Yang C., Tang C., Xu H., Li Z., Fan B., Li Y.",2020,Translational Andrology and Urology,"Background: The enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) and fast track surgery (FTS) protocols have been applied to a variety of surgeries and have been proven to reduce complications, accelerate rehabilitation, and reduce medical costs. However, the effectiveness of these protocols in minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (miRP) is still unclear. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of ERAS and FTS protocols in miRP. Methods: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases to collect randomized and observational studies comparing ERAS/FTS versus conventional care in miRP up to July 1, 2019. After screening for inclusion, data extraction, and quality assessment by two independent reviewers, the meta-analysis was performed with the RevMan 5.3 and STATA 15.1 software. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: In total, 11 studies involving 1,207 patients were included. Pooled data showed that ERAS/FTS was associated with a significant reduction in length of stay (LOS) (WMD: -2.41 days, 95% CI: -4.00 to -0.82 days, P=0.003), time to first anus exhaust (WMD: -0.74 days, 95% CI: -1.14 to -0.34 days, P=0.0003), and lower incidence of postoperative complications (RR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.92, P=0.01). No significant differences were found between groups for operation time, estimated blood loss, postoperative pain, blood transfusion rate, and readmission rate (P>0.01). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that the ERAS/FTS protocol is safe and effective in miRP. However, more extensive, long-term, prospective, multicenter follow-up studies, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are required to validate our findings. © Translational Andrology and Urology.

Synthesis and gas transport properties of addition polynorbornene with perfluorophenyl side groups,"Karpov G.O., Borisov I.L., Volkov A.V., Finkelshtein E.S., Bermeshev M.V.",2020,Polymers,"Polynorbornenes represent a fruitful class of polymers for structure-property study. Recently, vinyl-addition polynorbornenes bearing side groups of different natures were observed to exhibit excellent gas permeation ability, along with attractive C4H10/CH4 and CO2/N2 separation selectivities. However, to date, the gas transport properties of fluorinated addition polynorbornenes have not been reported. Herein, we synthesized addition polynorbornene with fluoroorganic substituents and executed a study on the gas transport properties of the polymer for the first time. A norbornene-type monomer with a C6F5 group, 3-pentafluorophenyl-exo-tricyclononene-7, was successfully involved in addition polymerization, resulting in soluble, high-molecular-weight products obtained in good or high yields. By varying the monomer concentration and monomer/catalyst ratio, it was possible to reach Mw values of (2.93-4.35) × 105. The molecular structure was confirmed by NMR and FTIR analysis. The contact angle with distilled water revealed the hydrophobic nature of the synthesized polymer as expected due to the presence of fluoroorganic side groups. A study of the permeability of various gases (He, H2, O2, N2, CO2, and CH4) through the prepared polymer disclosed a synergetic effect, which was achieved by the presence of both bulky perfluorinated side groups and rigid saturated main chains. Addition poly(3-pentafluorophenyl-exo-tricyclononene-7) was more permeable than its metathesis analogue by a factor of 7-21, or the similar polymer with flexible main chains, poly(pentafluorostyrene), in relation to the gases tested. Therefore, this investigation opens the door to fluorinated addition polynorbornenes as new potential polymeric materials for membrane gas separation. © 2020 by the authors.",Addition polynorbornenes; Gas permeability; Membrane gas separation; Norbornenes,Carbon dioxide; Contact angle; Gases; Monomers; Transport properties; Addition polymerization; Gas transport properties; High molecular weight; Monomer concentration; Poly(pentafluorostyrene); Separation selectivity; Structure property; Synthesized polymers; Gas permeable membranes,MDPI AG
Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) neurotoxicity in sentinel and non-traditional laboratory model systems: Potential utility in predicting adverse outcomes in human health,"Foguth R., Sepúlveda M.S., Cannon J.",2020,Toxics,"Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of chemicals that were widely used in manufacturing and are now present in the environment throughout the world. It is known that various PFAS are quantifiable in human in blood, but potential adverse health outcomes remain unclear. Sentinel and non-traditional model species are useful to study potential toxicity of PFAS in order to understand the relationship between environmental and human health. Here, we present a critical review of studies on the neurotoxicity of PFAS in sentinel and non-traditional laboratory model systems, including Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode), Dugesia japonica (planarian), Rana pipiens (frogs), Danio rerio and Oryzias melastigma (fish), and Ursus maritimus (polar bears). PFAS have been implicated in developmental neurotoxicity in non-traditional and traditional model systems as well as sentinel species, including effects on neurotransmitter levels, especially acetylcholine and its metabolism. However, further research on the mechanisms of toxicity needs to be conducted to determine if these chemicals are affecting organisms in a similar manner. Overall, findings tend to be similar among the various species, but bioaccumulation may vary, which needs to be taken into account in future studies by quantifying target organ concentrations of PFAS to better compare different species. Furthermore, data on the majority of PFAS is lacking in neurotoxicity testing, and additional studies are needed to corroborate findings thus far. © 2020 by the authors.",Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances; Perfluorobutane sulfonate; Perfluorooctane sulfonate; Perfluorooctanoate; Sentinel species,acetylcholine; perfluoroalkanoic acid; perfluorobutane sulfonate; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; adverse outcome; Anura; bioaccumulation; Caenorhabditis elegans; drinking; Dugesia japonica; human; motor performance; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; Oryzias melastigma; polar bear; prediction; Rana pipiens; Review; sentinel species; walking; zebra fish,MDPI AG
Innovations in extractive phases for in-tube solid-phase microextraction coupled to miniaturized liquid chromatography: A critical review,"Ponce-Rodríguez H.D., Verdú-Andrés J., Herráez-Hernández R., Campíns-Falcó P.",2020,Molecules,"Over the past years, a great effort has been devoted to the development of new sorbents that can be used to pack or to coat extractive capillaries for in-tube solid-phase microextraction (IT-SPME). Many of those efforts have been focused on the preparation of capillaries for miniaturized liquid chromatography (LC) due to the reduced availability of capillary columns with appropriate dimensions for this kind of system. Moreover, many of the extractive capillaries that have been used for IT-SPME so far are segments of open columns from the gas chromatography (GC) field, but the phase nature and dimensions are very limited. In particular, polar compounds barely interact with stationary GC phases. Capillary GC columns may also be unsuitable when highly selective extractions are needed. In this work, we provide an overview of the extractive capillaries that have been specifically developed for capillary LC (capLC) and nano LC (nanoLC) to enhance the overall performance of the IT-SPME, the chromatographic separation, and the detection. Different monolithic polymers, such as silica C18 and C8 polymers, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), polymers functionalized with antibodies, and polymers reinforced with different types of carbon nanotubes, metal, and metal oxide nanoparticles (including magnetic nanoparticles), and restricted access materials (RAMs) will be presented and critically discussed. © 2020 by the authors.

Prenatal Diagnosis of Glutaric Acidemia I Based on Amniotic Fluid Samples in 42 Families Using Genetic and Biochemical Approaches,"Xiao B., Qiu W., Ye J., Zhang H., Zhu H., Wang L., Liang L., Xu F., Chen T., Xu Y., Yu Y., Gu X., Han L.",2020,Frontiers in Genetics,"Direct mutation analysis is the major method for glutaric acidemia I (GA-I) prenatal diagnosis, while systemic application of a biochemical strategy is rare. We describe our experiences with metabolite measurement together with mutation analysis in GA-I prenatal diagnosis at a single center over 10 years. The data of genetic analysis and metabolite measurement using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry(GC/MS) and tandem mass spectrometry(MS/MS) in amniotic fluid samples of 44 fetuses from 42 GA-I families referred to our center from 2009 to 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Among these 44 fetuses, genetic and biochemical results were both available in 39 fetuses. Of these, 6 fetuses were judged as affected and 33 fetuses as unaffected by mutation analysis. The levels of glutarylcarnitine (C5DC), C5DC/octanoylcarnitine (C8), and glutaric acid in the supernatant of amniotic fluid from affected fetuses were significantly higher than those in unaffected fetuses [1.73μmol/L (0.89–4.19) vs. 0.16μmol/L (0.06–0.37), 26.26 (12.4–55.55) vs. 2.23 (1.04–8.44), and 103.94 mmol/mol creatinine (30.37–148.31) vs. 1.01mmol/mol creatinine (0–9.81), respectively; all P < 0.0001]. Among all families, two were found to have one causative mutation in the proband, in four pregnancies from these two families, three fetuses were judged as “unaffected” and one was judged as “affected” according to metabolites results. Postnatal follow-up showed a normal phenotype in all unaffected fetuses judged by mutation or metabolite analysis. C5DC, C5DC/C8, and glutaric acid levels in the supernatant of amniotic fluid showed significant differences and no overlap between the affected and unaffected fetuses. Biochemical strategy could be implemented as a quick and convenient method for the prenatal diagnosis of GA-I. © Copyright © 2020 Xiao, Qiu, Ye, Zhang, Zhu, Wang, Liang, Xu, Chen, Xu, Yu, Gu and Han.",glutaric acid; glutaric acidemia I; glutarylcarnitine; mass spectrometry; prenatal diagnosis,creatinine; genomic DNA; glutaric acid; glutarylcarnitine; octanoylcarnitine; unclassified drug; amniocentesis; amnion cell; amnion fluid; Article; autosomal recessive disorder; fetus; follow up; genetic analysis; glutaric acidemia I; high risk pregnancy; human; mass fragmentography; metabolic disorder; mutation; phenotype; prenatal diagnosis; retrospective study; Sanger sequencing; tandem mass spectrometry,Frontiers Media S.A.
Metabolomic profiles of the endangered St. Lawrence Estuary beluga population and associations with organohalogen contaminants,"Simond A.E., Houde M., Lesage V., Michaud R., Verreault J.",2020,Science of the Total Environment,"The endangered beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) population residing in the St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE; Eastern Canada) is declining. The elevated tissue concentrations of a wide range of organohalogen contaminants might play a role in the non-recovery of this whale population. Organohalogens have been reported to impair the regulation of several metabolic products from cellular reactions in mammals such as amino acids and fatty acids. The objective of this study was to investigate a suite of organohalogens including polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and selected emerging flame retardants in blubber (biopsy) collected from 40 SLE male belugas, and their relationships to skin concentrations of targeted metabolites (i.e., 21 amino acids, 22 biogenic amines, 18 fatty acids, and 17 energy metabolites). A cluster analysis based on metabolomic profiles distinguished two main subgroups of belugas in the upper and lower sector of their summer habitat in the SLE. These results indicate that ecological factors such as local prey availability and diet composition played a role in shaping the metabolite profiles of belugas. Moreover, SCCP concentrations in SLE male belugas correlated negatively with those of four unsaturated fatty acids (C16:1ω7, C22:5ω3c1, C22:5ω3c2, and C22:6ω3), and positively with those of acetylornithine (biogenic amine). These findings suggest that biological functions such as lipid metabolism represent potential targets for organohalogens in this population, and further our understanding on potential health risks associated with elevated organohalogen exposure in cetaceans. Our results also underscore the necessity of considering ecological factors (e.g., diet and habitat use) in metabolomic studies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Halogenated flame retardant; Lipid metabolism; Marine mammal; Metabolomic; Organochlorine; Short-chain chlorinated paraffin,"Amines; Amino acids; Biomolecules; Cluster analysis; Ecosystems; Flame retardants; Health risks; Mammals; Metabolism; Organic pollutants; Paraffins; Unsaturated fatty acids; Halogenated flame retardant; Lipid metabolisms; Marine mammals; Metabolomics; Organochlorines; Short-chain chlorinated paraffins; Metabolites; alanine; amino acid; biogenic amine; fatty acid; flame retardant; glutamic acid; glutamine; glycine; histidine; methionine; organochlorine pesticide; organohalogen derivative; ornithine; paraffin; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; serine; taurine; unsaturated fatty acid; gelatin; isinglass; cetacean; concentration (composition); endangered species; estuarine environment; estuarine pollution; flame retardant; lipid; marine mammal; metabolism; metabolite; organochlorine; animal tissue; Article; Canada; Cetacea; cluster analysis; concentration (parameter); correlation analysis; dietary intake; endangered species; environmental exposure; environmental factor; estuary; food composition; habitat use; health hazard; high performance liquid chromatography; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; lipid metabolism; male; mass fragmentography; metabolomics; nonhuman; prey; priority journal; skin biopsy; summer; animal; beluga whale; water pollutant; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Saint Lawrence Estuary; Cetacea; Delphinapterus; Delphinapterus leucas; Mammalia; Animals; Beluga Whale; Canada; Gelatin; Male; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier B.V.
Tamponade in surgery for retinal detachment associated with proliferative vitreoretinopathy,"Schwartz S.G., Flynn Jr H.W., Wang X., Kuriyan A.E., Abariga S.A., Lee W.-H.",2020,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,"Background: Retinal detachment (RD) with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) often requires surgery to restore normal anatomy and to stabilize or improve vision. PVR usually occurs in association with recurrent RD (that is, after initial retinal re-attachment surgery), but occasionally may be associated with primary RD. Either way, for both circumstances a tamponade agent (gas or silicone oil) is needed during surgery to reduce the rate of postoperative recurrent RD. Objectives: The objective of this review was to assess the relative safety and effectiveness of various tamponade agents used with surgery for RD complicated by PVR. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to January 2019), Embase (January 1980 to January 2019), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2019), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 January 2019. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on participants undergoing surgery for RD associated with PVR that compared various tamponade agents. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors screened the search results independently. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results: We identified four RCTs (601 participants) that provided data for the primary and secondary outcomes. Three RCTs provided data on visual acuity, two reported on macular attachment, one on retinal reattachment and another two on adverse events such as RD, worsening visual acuity and intraocular pressure. Study Characteristics. Participants' characteristics varied across studies and across intervention groups, with an age range between 21 to 89 years, and were predominantly men. The Silicone Study was conducted in the USA and consisted of two RCTs: (silicone oil versus sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas tamponades; 151 participants) and (silicone oil versus perfluropropane (C3F8) gas tamponades; 271 participants). The third RCT compared heavy silicone oil (a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8) and silicone oil) with standard silicone oil (either 1000 centistokes or 5000 centistokes; 94 participants). The fourth RCT compared 1000 centistokes with 5000 centistokes silicone oil in 85 participants. We assessed most RCTs at low or unclear risk of bias for most 'Risk of bias' domains. Findings. Although SF6 gas was reported to be associated with worse anatomic and visual outcomes than was silicone oil at one year (quantitative data not reported), at two years, silicone oil compared to SF6 gas showed no evidence of a difference in visual acuity (33% versus 51%; risk ratio (RR) 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 2.66; 1 RCT, 87 participants; low-certainty evidence). At one year, another RCT comparing silicone oil and C3F8 gas found no evidence of a difference in visual acuity between the two groups (41% versus 39%; RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.31; 1 RCT, 264 participants; low-certainty evidence). In a third RCT, participants treated with standard silicone oil compared to those receiving heavy silicone oil also showed no evidence of a difference in the change in visual acuity at one year, measured on logMAR scale (mean difference -0.03 logMAR; 95% CI -0.35 to 0.29; 1 RCT; 93 participants; low-certainty evidence). The fourth RCT with 5000-centistoke and 1000-centistoke comparisons did not report data on visual acuity. For macular attachment, participants treated with silicone oil may probably experience more favorable outcomes than did participants who received SF6 at both one year (quantitative data not reported) and two years (58% versus 79%; RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.86; 1 RCT; 87 participants; low-certainty evidence). In another RCT, silicone oil compared to C3F8 at one year found no evidence of difference in macular attachment (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 1 RCT, 264 participants; low-certainty evidence). One RCT that compared 5000 centistokes to 1000 centistoke reported that retinal reattachment was successful in 67 participants (78.8%) with first surgery and 79 participants (92.9%) with the second surgery, and no evidence of between-group difference (1 RCT; 85 participants; low-certainty evidence). The fourth RCT that compared standard silicone oil with heavy silicone oil did not report on macular attachment. Adverse events. In one RCT (86 participants), those receiving standard 1000 centistoke silicone oil compared with those of the 5000 centistoke silicone oil showed no evidence of a difference in intraocular pressure elevation at 18 months (24% versus 22%; RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.41 to 1.94; low-certainty evidence), visually significant cataract (49% versus 64%; RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.89; low-certainty evidence), and incidence of retina detachment after the removal of silicone oil (RR 0.36 95% CI 0.08 to 1.67; low-certainty evidence). Another RCT that compared standard silicone oil with heavy silicone oil suggests no difference in retinal detachment at one year (25% versus 22%; RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.48; 1 RCT; 186 participants; low-certainty evidence). Retinal detachment was not reported in the RCTs that compared silicone oil versus SF6 and silicone oil versus to C3F8. Authors' conclusions: There do not appear to be any major differences in outcomes between C3F8 and silicone oil. Silicone oil may be better than SF6 for macular attachment and other short-term outcomes. The choice of a tamponade agent should be individualized for each patient. The use of either C3F8 or standard silicone oil appears reasonable for most patients with RD associated with PVR. Heavy silicone oil, which is not available for routine clinical use in the USA, may not demonstrate evidence of superiority over standard silicone oil. Copyright © 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Early life exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and ADHD: A meta-analysis of nine European population-based studies,"Forns J., Verner M.-A., Iszatt N., Nowack N., Bach C.C., Vrijheid M., Costa O., Andiarena A., Sovcikova E., Høyer B.B., Wittsiepe J., Lopez-Espinosa M.-J., Ibarluzea J., Hertz-Picciotto I., Toft G., Stigum H., Guxens M., Liew Z., Eggesbø M.",2020,Environmental Health Perspectives,"INTRODUCTION: To date, the evidence for an association between perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between early life exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and ADHD in a collaborative study including nine European population-based studies, encompassing 4,826 mother–child pairs. METHODS: Concentrations of PFOS and PFOA were measured in maternal serum/plasma during pregnancy, or in breast milk, with different timing of sample collection in each cohort. We used a validated pharmacokinetic model of pregnancy and lactation to estimate concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in children at birth and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of age. We classified ADHD using recommended cutoff points for each instrument used to derive symptoms scores. We used multiple imputation for missing covariates, logistic regression to model the association between PFAS exposure and ADHD in each study, and combined all adjusted study-specific effect estimates using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 399 children were classified as having ADHD, with a prevalence ranging from 2.3% to 7.3% in the studies. Early life exposure to PFOS or PFOA was not associated with ADHD during childhood [odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 0.96 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.06) to 1.02 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.11)]. Results from stratified models suggest potential differential effects of PFAS related to child sex and maternal education. CONCLUSION: We did not identify an increased prevalence of ADHD in association with early life exposure to PFOS and PFOA. However, stratified analyses suggest that there may be an increased prevalence of ADHD in association with PFAS exposure in girls, in children from nulliparous women, and in children from low-educated mothers, all of which warrant further exploration. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5444. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The key role of purine metabolism in the folate-dependent phenotype of autism spectrum disorders: An in silico analysis,"Geryk J., Krsička D., Vlčková M., Havlovicová M., Macek M., Jr., Pourová R.K.",2020,Metabolites,"Folate deficiency in the critical developmental period has been repeatedly associated with an increased risk of Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but the key pathophysiological mechanism has not yet been identified. In this work, we focused on identifying genes whose defect has similar consequences to folate depletion in the metabolic network. Within the Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) framework, we developed a method of blocked metabolites that allowed us to define the metabolic consequences of various gene defects and folate depletion. We identified six genes (GART, PFAS, PPAT, PAICS, ATIC, and ADSL) whose blocking results in nearly the same effect in the metabolic network as folate depletion. All of these genes form the purine biosynthetic pathway. We found that, just like folate depletion, the blockade of any of the six genes mentioned above results in a blockage of purine metabolism. We hypothesize that this can lead to decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and subsequently, an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) pool in neurons in the case of rapid cell division. Based on our results, we consider the methylation defect to be a potential cause of ASD, due to the depletion of purine, and consequently S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), biosynthesis. © 2020 by the authors.

Synthesis and Сharacterization of Soft-Bridged Iminopyridyl Iron and Cobalt Complexes and Their Catalytic Behavior toward Ethylene Oligomerization,"Na Zhang, Chen L., Li C., Wang J.",2020,Russian Journal of Physical Chemistry A,"Abstract: Two kinds of soft-bridged iminopyridyl ligands and their metal (iron and cobalt) complexes were synthesized. All soft-bridged iminopyridyl ligands and metal complexes were fully characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, UV–Vis, ESI-MS, and ICP-MS. Upon activation with methylaluminoxane (MAO), these metal complexes exhibited moderate catalytic activity up to the range of 105 g/(mol Me h) for ethylene oligomerization, and butene was the major product, while for the cobalt complexes, activation with EtAlCl2 in toluene produced Friedel–Crafts toluene alkylation products. In the catalytic systems, cobalt complexes exhibited better catalytic activity and selectivity towards higher carbon number olefins (≥C8) than their iron analogues. The correlations between metal complexes and their catalytic activities and product distribution were investigated in detail under various reaction parameters such as reaction temperature, ethylene pressure and amount of co-catalyst. Under optimized conditions ([Co] = 7 μmol, 35°C, 1.0 MPa, MAO-to-Co = 500), soft-bridged iminopyridyl cobalt catalyst Co1 led to catalytic activity of 6.18 × 105 g/(mol Co h) and 29.97% selectivity for higher carbon number olefins. However, under optimized conditions ([Fe] = 7 μmol, 25°C, 1.0 MPa, MAO-to-Fe = 500), soft-bridged iminopyridyl iron catalyst Fe1 led to catalytic activity of 4.73 × 105 g/(mol Fe h) and 22.60% selectivity for higher carbon number olefins. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",cobalt complex; ethylene oligomerization; hyperbranched macromolecule; iminopyridyl ligand; iron complex,Aliphatic compounds; Carbon; Catalyst selectivity; Chemical activation; Cobalt compounds; Ethylene; Iron compounds; Ligands; Metal complexes; Metals; Oligomerization; Oligomers; Synthesis (chemical); Toluene; Catalytic behavior; Ethylene oligomerizations; Iron and cobalt complex; Optimized conditions; Product distributions; Reaction parameters; Reaction temperature; Toluene alkylation; Catalyst activity,Pleiades Publishing
The incidence and risk of infusion phlebitis with peripheral intravenous catheters: A meta-analysis,"Lv L., Zhang J.",2020,Journal of Vascular Access,"Introduction: Phlebitis is a common complication associated with the use of peripheral intravenous catheters. The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of phlebitis with peripheral intravenous catheter use and to identify risk factors for phlebitis development. Method: Literature survey was conducted in electronic databases (CINAHL, Embase, Google Scholar, Ovid, and PubMed), and studies were included if they used peripheral intravenous catheter for therapeutic or volumetric infusion and reported phlebitis incidence rates. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to obtain overall and subgroup phlebitis incidence rates and odds ratio between males and females in phlebitis incidence. Results: Thirty-five studies were included (20,697 catheters used for 15,791 patients; age 57.1 years (95% confidence interval: 55.0, 59.2); 53.9% males (95% confidence interval: 42.3, 65.5)). Incidence of phlebitis was 30.7 per 100 catheters (95% confidence interval: 27.2, 34.2). Incidence of severe phlebitis was 3.6% (95% confidence interval: 2.7%, 4.6%). Incidence of phlebitis was higher in non-intervened (30% (95% confidence interval: 27%, 33%)) than in intervened (21% (95% confidence interval: 15%, 27%)) groups, and with Teflon (33% (95% confidence interval: 25%, 41%)) than Vialon (27% (95% confidence interval: 21%, 32%)) cannula use. Odds of developing phlebitis was significantly higher in females (odds ratio = 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.93); p = 0.02). Longer dwelling time, antibiotics infusion, female gender, forearm insertion, infectious disease, and Teflon catheter are important risk factors for phlebitis development identified by the included studies. Conclusion: Incidence of phlebitis with the use of peripheral intravenous catheters during infusion is 31%. Severe phlebitis develops in 4% of all patients. Risk of phlebitis development can be reduced by adapting appropriate interventions. © The Author(s) 2019.",catheter; incidence; intravenous infusion; Phlebitis; thrombophlebitis,"antibiotic agent; politef; polyurethan; potassium chloride; antibiotic therapy; Article; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; dwell time; human; meta analysis; phlebitis; risk factor; sex difference; adult; adverse event; aged; catheterization; female; incidence; intravenous drug administration; male; middle aged; phlebitis; risk assessment; severity of illness index; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Catheterization, Peripheral; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infusions, Intravenous; Male; Middle Aged; Phlebitis; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Young Adult",SAGE Publications Ltd
Cobalt hybrid catalysts in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis,"Adeleke A.A., Liu X., Lu X., Moyo M., Hildebrandt D.",2020,Reviews in Chemical Engineering,"Currently, cobalt and zeolites are used in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) to produce gasoline-range hydrocarbons (GRHs) that constitute clean and environmentally friendly fuels. This technology has earned a great deal of attention from researchers across the world, as it provides a substitute for fuel derived from fossil crudes, which have hitherto been the sole source of the petrol and diesel required by the industry. However, owing to the depletion of the earth's oil and coal reserves and the unfavourable environmental impact of conventional fuel production, an alternative source of fuel is needed. This article provides a critical review of the technological challenges involved in producing middle isoparaffins and olefins (gasoline hydrocarbons) by FTS. These involve combining cobalt-based catalysts and zeolites to form hybrid catalysts. In this review, we address most of these by setting out each method of creating cobalt and zeolite hybrid catalysts in turn, so that researchers can identify which applications are most effective for producing GRHs. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",cobalt hybrid catalysts; cobalt-based catalysts; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; gasoline-range hydrocarbons; isoparaffins and olefins in FTS; zeolites,Catalysts; Coal; Cobalt; Environmental impact; Gasoline; Olefins; Proven reserves; Reserves to production ratio; Zeolites; Alternative source; Cobalt-based catalysts; Environmentally friendly fuels; Gasoline hydrocarbon; Gasoline-range hydrocarbons; Hybrid catalysts; Isoparaffins; Technological challenges; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis,De Gruyter
Destruction of Per- A nd Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) with Advanced Reduction Processes (ARPs): A Critical Review,"Cui J., Gao P., Deng Y.",2020,Environmental Science and Technology,"Advanced reduction processes (ARPs) have emerged as a promising method for destruction of persistent per- A nd polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in water due to the generation of short-lived and highly reductive hydrated electrons (eaq -). This study provides a critical review on the mechanisms and performance of reductive destruction of PFAS with eaq -. Unique properties of eaq - and its generation in different ARP systems, particularly UV/sulfite and UV/iodide, are overviewed. Different degradation mechanisms of PFAS chemicals, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and others (e.g., short chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs), per- A nd polyfluoro dicarboxylic acids, and fluorotelomer carboxylic acids), are reviewed, discussed, and compared. The degradation pathways of these PFAS chemicals rely heavily upon their head groups. For specific PFAS types, fluoroalkyl chain lengths may also affect their reductive degradation patterns. Degradation and defluorination efficiencies of PFAS are considerably influenced by solution chemistry parameters and operating factors, such as pH, dose of chemical solute (i.e., sulfite or iodide) for eaq - photoproduction, dissolved oxygen, humic acid, nitrate, and temperature. Furthermore, implications of the state-of-the-art knowledge on practical PFAS control actions in water industries are discussed and the priority research needs are identified.

Understanding the interaction of estrogenic ligands with estrogen receptors: a survey of the functional and binding kinetic studies,"Jin J., Wu P., Zhang X., Li D., Wong W.-L., Lu Y.-J., Sun N., Zhang K.",2020,"Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part C: Toxicology and Carcinogenesis","The investigation of estrogen actions and their interaction characteristics with estrogen receptors (ERs) to induce unique functional features inside cells have allowed us to understand better the regulation of many vital physiological and cellular processes in humans. The biological effects of estrogenic ligands or compounds are mediated via estrogen receptors that act as the ligand-activated transcription factors. Therefore, the study on ligand-ER interaction properties and mechanism of ligand-ER complexes binding to specific estrogen response elements located in the promoters of target genes are very critical to realize the complicated biological process regulated by the endogenous estrogens. Several reviews have provided comprehensive and updated information on the influence of estrogen receptors in health and disease. However, the mechanism of estrogen–ERs binding and affinity aspects at molecular level is relatively under-investigated. This review thus aims to shed light on the significance of the binding kinetics of ligand-ER interactions because the information provide great assistance to define how a ligand or a drug can communicate with physiology to produce a desired therapeutic response. In addition, the most frequently used methodologies for the binding kinetic study are highlighted over the last decade. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Endocrine disruptors; estrogen receptors; estrogen–estrogen receptor interactions,"Kinetic theory; Kinetics; Physiology; Transcription; Biological effects; Biological process; Estrogen receptor; Estrogen response elements; Functional features; Interaction characteristics; Interaction properties; Updated informations; Ligands; 4 octylphenol; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; aldosterone; alkylphenol; alpha zearalenol; antiestrogen; apigenin; atrazine; butylated hydroxyanisole; corticosterone; coumestrol; dichlorophen; dieldrin; diethylstilbestrol derivative; endosulfan; estradiol; estriol; estrogen; estrogen receptor; estrogen receptor alpha; estrogen receptor beta; estrone; ethinylestradiol; genistein; hydroxytamoxifen; ligand; monobenzone; naringenin; nonylphenol; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; phthalic acid; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; phthalic acid dibutyl ester; phthalic acid diethyl ester; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; prasterone; progesterone; raloxifene; resveratrol; selective estrogen receptor modulator; simazine; sitosterol; testosterone; zearalenone; Article; binding kinetics; breast cancer; cancer therapy; DNA sequence; drug design; EC50; endometrium cancer; hormone receptor interaction; IC50; maximum binding capacity; mutation; osteoporosis; reproductive health; surface plasmon resonance; Xenopus laevis; DNA responsive element; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; human; kinetics; promoter region; Estrogens; Estrone; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Kinetics; Ligands; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Receptors, Estrogen; Response Elements; Transcription, Genetic","Bellwether Publishing, Ltd."
Endocrine disrupting chemicals and type 1 diabetes,"Predieri B., Bruzzi P., Bigi E., Ciancia S., Madeo S.F., Lucaccioni L., Iughetti L.",2020,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the most common chronic metabolic disease in children and adolescents. The etiology of T1D is not fully understood but it seems multifactorial. The genetic background determines the predisposition to develop T1D, while the autoimmune process against β-cells seems to be also determined by environmental triggers, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Environmental EDCs may act throughout different temporal windows as single chemical agent or as chemical mixtures. They could affect the development and the function of the immune system or of the β-cells function, promoting autoimmunity and increasing the susceptibility to autoimmune attack. Human studies evaluating the potential role of exposure to EDCs on the pathogenesis of T1D are few and demonstrated contradictory results. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize experimental and epidemiological studies on the potential role of exposure to EDCs in the development of T1D. We highlight what we know by animals about EDCs’ effects on mechanisms leading to T1D development and progression. Studies evaluating the EDC levels in patients with T1D were also reported. Moreover, we discussed why further studies are needed and how they should be designed to better understand the causal mechanisms and the next prevention interventions. © 2020 by the authors.

A Neural basis for Octanoic acid regulation of energy balance,"Haynes V.R., Michael N.J., van den Top M., Zhao F.-Y., Brown R.D., De Souza D., Dodd G.T., Spanswick D., Watt M.J.",2020,Molecular Metabolism,"Objectives: Nutrient sensing by hypothalamic neurons is critical for the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. We aimed to identify long- and medium-chain fatty acid species transported into the brain, their effects on energy balance, and the mechanisms by which they regulate activity of hypothalamic neurons. Methods: Simultaneous blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling was undertaken in rats and metabolic analyses using radiolabeled fatty acid tracers were performed on mice. Electrophysiological recording techniques were used to investigate signaling mechanisms underlying fatty acid-induced changes in activity of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. Results: Medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) octanoic acid (C8:0), unlike long-chain fatty acids, was rapidly transported into the hypothalamus of mice and almost exclusively oxidized, causing rapid, transient reductions in food intake and increased energy expenditure. Octanoic acid differentially regulates the excitability of POMC neurons, activating these neurons directly via GPR40 and inducing inhibition via an indirect non-synaptic, purine, and adenosine receptor-dependent mechanism. Conclusions: MCFA octanoic acid is a central signaling nutrient that targets POMC neurons via distinct direct and indirect signal transduction pathways to instigate changes in energy status. These results could explain the beneficial health effects that accompany MCFA consumption. © 2020 The Authors",Cerebrospinal fluid; Electrophysiology; Energy expenditure; Fatty acid metabolism; Food intake; Pro-opiomelanocortin neuron,"adenosine receptor; G protein coupled receptor 40; long chain fatty acid; octanoic acid; proopiomelanocortin; purine; octanoic acid; octanoic acid derivative; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; brain nerve cell; controlled study; energy balance; energy expenditure; fat intake; fatty acid transport; food intake; hypothalamus; male; nerve cell excitability; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; regulatory mechanism; signal transduction; animal; energy metabolism; metabolism; nerve cell; Wistar rat; Animals; Caprylates; Energy Metabolism; Male; Neurons; Rats; Rats, Wistar",Elsevier GmbH
High-throughput non-targeted metabolomics study of the effects of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) on the metabolic characteristics of A. thaliana leaves,"Guo Q., He Z., Liu X., Liu B., Zhang Y.",2020,Science of the Total Environment,"The ecotoxicity of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is complex and has been reported in animals (including fish and mice), but the effects of PFOS in plants, especially the toxic mechanisms, have rarely been studied. High-throughput nontargeted metabolomics methods for comprehensive assessment were selected to study changes in metabolic characteristics in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves by exposure to different concentrations of PFOS throughout the growth period (30 days). All the metabolites were analyzed by PCA and OPLS-DA methods, by the cutoff of VIP and p-value, 53 biomarkers were found and significantly regulated, all amino acids except glutamate were inhibited and probably associated with binding to protein, auxin and cytokinin of phytohormones were significantly down-regulated. In response mechanism to oxidative stress from PFOS, the phenylpropanoid pathway were fully activated to form several polyphenols and further enhanced into several flavonoids against the reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the primary defend pathway, in addition, ascorbate, trehalose and nicotinamide also were activated and help decrease the damage from oxidative stress. These results provide insights into the mechanism underlying the phytotoxicity of PFOS. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Metabolic mechanism; Metabolomics; PFOS; Phytotoxicity,Fish; Mammals; Metabolites; Plants (botany); Comprehensive assessment; Metabolic characteristics; Metabolic mechanism; Metabolomics; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; PFOS; Phenylpropanoid pathways; Phytotoxicity; Metabolism; environmental marker; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; polyphenol; reactive oxygen metabolite; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; angiosperm; dose-response relationship; leaf; metabolism; metabolite; persistent organic pollutant; phytotoxicity; Arabidopsis thaliana; Article; chemical structure; controlled study; environmental exposure; high throughput analysis; metabolomics; nonhuman; oxidative stress; phytotoxicity; plant leaf; plant stress; priority journal; Arabidopsis; plant leaf; Animalia; Arabidopsis thaliana; Mus; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Arabidopsis; Fluorocarbons; Metabolomics; Plant Leaves,Elsevier B.V.
"Removal of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from water by adsorption: Role of PFAS chain length, effect of organic matter and challenges in adsorbent regeneration","Gagliano E., Sgroi M., Falciglia P.P., Vagliasindi F.G.A., Roccaro P.",2020,Water Research,"Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a wide group of environmentally persistent organic compounds of industrial origin, which are of great concern due to their harmful impact on human health and ecosystems. Amongst long-chain PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) are the most detected in the aquatic environment, even though their use has been limited by recent regulations. Recently, more attention has been posed on the short-chain compounds, due to their use as an alternative to long-chain ones, and to their high mobility in the water bodies. Therefore, short-chain PFAS have been increasingly detected in the environmental compartments. The main process investigated and implemented for PFAS removal is adsorption. However, to date, most adsorption studies have focused on synthetic water. The main objective of this article is to provide a critical review of the recent peer-reviewed studies on the removal of long- and short-chain PFAS by adsorption. Specific objectives are to review 1) the performance of different adsorbents for both long- and short-chain PFAS, 2) the effect of organic matter, and 3) the adsorbent regeneration techniques. Strong anion-exchange resins seem to better remove both long- and short-chain PFAS. However, the adsorption capacity of short-chain PFAS is lower than that observed for long-chain PFAS. Therefore, short-chain PFAS removal is more challenging. Furthermore, the effect of organic matter on PFAS adsorption in water or wastewater under real environmental conditions is overlooked. In most studies high PFAS levels have been often investigated without organic matter presence. The rapid breakthrough of PFAS is also a limiting factor and the regeneration of PFAS exhausted adsorbents is very challenging and needs more research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Adsorption; Adsorption mechanism; Anion-exchange; Long- and short-chain PFAS; Organic matter; Regeneration,"Adsorption; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Driers (materials); Ion exchange resins; Adsorption mechanism; Anion exchange; Long- and short-chain PFAS; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; Persistent organic compounds; Regeneration; Strong-anion exchange resins; Chemicals removal (water treatment); activated carbon; adsorbent; alkyl group; anion exchange resin; molecularly imprinted polymer; multi walled nanotube; nanoparticle; organic matter; poly and perfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; water; fluorocarbon; water; adsorption; environmental conditions; ion exchange; limiting factor; organic compound; organic matter; wastewater; adsorption; anion exchange; priority journal; regeneration; Review; waste water; ecosystem; human; water pollutant; Adsorption; Ecosystem; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier Ltd
Treatment train approaches for the remediation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS): A critical review,"Lu D., Sha S., Luo J., Huang Z., Zhang Jackie X.",2020,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have recently drawn great attention due to their ubiquitous presence in aquatic environments and potential toxicity to human health and the environment. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that “passive” removal approaches, such as adsorption, filtration, and reverse osmosis or “active” degradation technologies, such as enhanced photolysis, electrochemical oxidation, and sonochemical destruction, are all able to individually conduct remedial measures for PFAS contamination at some level. However, drawbacks, specifically high energy consumption, low cost-efficiency, and extreme operating conditions, are commonly observed from these studies which significantly suppress the future for commercialization of these innovative technologies. Since 2015, a new trend of PFAS remediation has emerged that uses multiple synergetic technologies simultaneously (known as treatment train processes) to effectively achieve in-situ remediation of PFAS. This paper provides new insight of the recently reported treatment train studies selected from approximately 150 different publications with regards to the remediation of PFAS and discusses their innovative designs, remediation performances, present limits, and possible improvements. Based on a comprehensive review of the current treatment train studies, this review work proposes a new design that consists of three individual technologies, namely, nanofiltration, electrochemical anodic oxidation, and electro-Fenton degradation, to maximize economic and environmental benefits of PFAS remedial measures. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Electro-Fenton; Electrochemical anodic oxidation; In-situ remediation; Nanofiltration; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS); Treatment train study,Costs; Electrochemical oxidation; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Nanofiltration; Photodegradation; Photolysis; Remediation; Electro-fenton; Electrochemical anodic oxidation; In-situ remediation; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Treatment train study; Anodic oxidation; biochar; charcoal; hydrocarbon; hydrogen peroxide; ion exchange resin; iron nanoparticle; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; aquatic environment; commercialization; degradation; electrochemical method; innovation; oxidation; photolysis; pollutant removal; remediation; reverse osmosis; adsorption; degradation; diatom; electrochemical anodic oxidation; electrolysis; electron beam; mineralization; nanofiltration; oxidation; photolysis; Review; thermal mineralization; ultrafiltration,Elsevier B.V.
"Metabolomics reveals that tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP) causes disruption of membrane lipids in microalga Scenedesmus obliquus","Wang L., Huang X., Laserna A.K.C., Li S.F.Y.",2020,Science of the Total Environment,"Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP) is one of the most widely used organophosphate ester flame retardants. The presence of TDCPP in surface waters and aquatic organisms have been reported worldwide, yet the ecological risk of TDCPP on microalgae is rarely studied. We investigated the biotransformation of TDCPP and its toxicity on the microalga Scenedesmus obliquus using an untargeted metabolomics approach. Exposure to TDCPP resulted in a dose-response decrease of micoalgal biomass. In the presence of microalgae, TDCPP concentration in the media decreased by 25.3–40.6% after 5 days. TDCPP metabolites were identified in the media including hydrolysis and hydroxyl-substituted dechlorination products. A dose-response separation of metabolic profiles of microalgae was observed, with effect seen at the lowest concentration of 10 µg/L tested, which is slightly higher than environmentally relevant concentrations. Differentiated metabolites identified include 52 lipids and 6 polar metabolites. Analysis of altered lipid pathways suggests that microalgal cells reinforce thylakoid membranes (function to protect photosynthesis) by compromising the integrity of plasma membrane (function to protect cellular substances) and extraplastidial cellular membranes. Changes in the polar metabolites might indicate osmotic stress and improved NO signaling after TDCPP exposure. Consistent with perturbation of membrane lipids, further experiment confirmed that exposure to 10 mg/L TDCPP resulted in significant (p < 0.01) plasma membrane damage. This study indicates biotransformation and the membrane damage toxicity mechanism of TDCPP on S. obliquus, demonstrating the usefulness of metabolomics for the toxicity mechanism elucidation of emerging pollutants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",LC-QTOF; Lipid remodeling; Membrane damage; Metabolic profile; Organophosphate flame retardant,"Algae; Aquatic organisms; Biomolecules; Cell membranes; Dechlorination; Flame retardants; Lipids; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Toxicity; LC-QTOF; Lipid remodeling; Membrane damage; Metabolic profiles; Organophosphate flame retardants; Metabolites; flame retardant; hydroxyl group; membrane lipid; tris(1,3 dichloro 2 propyl)phosphate; unclassified drug; flame retardant; membrane lipid; organophosphate; organophosphorus compound; phosphate; tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate; concentration (composition); flame retardant; lipid; membrane; metabolism; microalga; organophosphate; Acutodesmus obliquus; Article; biomass; biotransformation; cell membrane; controlled study; cytotoxicity; dechlorination; exposure; extraplastidial cellular membrane; hydrolysis; membrane damage; metabolite; metabolomics; nonhuman; pollutant; priority journal; thylakoid membrane; microalga; Scenedesmus; Scenedesmus obliquus; Flame Retardants; Membrane Lipids; Metabolomics; Microalgae; Organophosphates; Organophosphorus Compounds; Phosphates; Scenedesmus",Elsevier B.V.
Impact of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) on seed germination and seedling growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.),"Lian J., Wu J., Xiong H., Zeb A., Yang T., Su X., Su L., Liu W.",2020,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"Microplastics and nanoplastics are emerging pollutants of global concern. However, the understanding of their ecological effects on terrestrial plants is still limited. We conducted the systematic research to reveal the impact of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) (0.01–10 mg/L) on seed germination and seedling growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The results showed that PSNPs had no discernible effect on seed germination rate whereas significantly (p < 0.01) increased root elongation by 88.6 %–122.6 % when compared with the control. Similarly, remarkable increases in carbon, nitrogen contents, and plant biomass were also observed after exposure to PSNPs. Moreover, PSNPs could reduce the shoot to root biomass ratio (S:R ratio) of wheat seedlings. Furthermore, the imagings of a 3D laser confocal scanning microscopy (LCSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that PSNPs were taken up and subsequently down-top transported to shoot. The absorption and accumulation of four micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) in wheat were generally reduced in varying degrees. Notably, metabolomics analysis revealed that all PSNPs treatments altered the leaf metabolic profiles mainly by regulating energy metabolisms and amino acid metabolisms. These findings are expected to provide new insights into the effects of PSNPs on crop plants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Metabolomics; Nutrient element; Plant growth; Polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs); Uptake; Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.),Crops; Cultivation; Ecology; Metabolism; Nutrients; Polystyrenes; Scanning electron microscopy; Metabolomics; Nanoplastics; Nutrient elements; Plant growth; Uptake; Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); Seed; carbon; copper; iron; manganese; nanoparticle; nitrogen; plastic; polystyrene derivative; polystyrene nanoplastic; zinc; chlorophyll; polystyrene derivative; amino acid; bioaccumulation; biomass; carbon; crop plant; germination; growth rate; metabolism; nitrogen; plastic; research work; root-shoot ratio; seedling; wheat; absorption; amino acid metabolism; bioaccumulation; biomass; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; energy metabolism; germination; nonhuman; plant growth; plant leaf; scanning electron microscopy; Triticum aestivum; drug effect; embryology; genetics; germination; metabolism; photosynthesis; plant root; plant seed; seedling; shoot; toxicity; wheat; Triticum aestivum; Biomass; Chlorophyll; Germination; Microplastics; Photosynthesis; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Polystyrenes; Seedlings; Seeds; Triticum,Elsevier B.V.
Endocrine-disrupting chemicals and their effects during female puberty: A review of current evidence,"Lucaccioni L., Trevisani V., Marrozzini L., Bertoncelli N., Predieri B., Lugli L., Berardi A., Iughetti L.",2020,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,"Puberty is the process of physical changes between childhood and adulthood during which adolescents reach sexual maturity and become capable of reproduction. It is considered one of the main temporal windows of susceptibility for the influence of the endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). EDCs may act as single chemical agents or as chemical mixtures; they can be pubertal influencers, accelerating and anticipating the processing of maturation of secondary sexual characteristics. Moreover, recent studies have started to point out how exposure to EDCs during puberty may predispose to breast cancer later in life. In fact, the estrogen-mimicking endocrine disruptors (EEDs) may influence breast tissue development during puberty in two main ways: the first is the action on the proliferation of the breast stromal cells, the second concerns epigenetic mechanisms. The aim of this mini-review was to better highlight what is new and what is not completely known regarding the role of EDCs during puberty. © 2020 by the authors.

Morphometric Features of Patent Foramen Ovale as a Risk Factor of Cerebrovascular Accidents: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Hołda M.K., Koziej M.",2020,Cerebrovascular Diseases,"Introduction: It is still disputable whether specific morphometric features of the patent foramen ovale (PFO) may stratify patients by the related probability that a discovered PFO is incidental or stroke related. Objective: We aimed to determine whether certain morphometrical characteristics of PFO are associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents, using a meta-analytical approach. Methods: We performed a systematic review of electronic databases for studies that compared morphometric parameters of PFO assessed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in subjects with cryptogenic cerebrovascular accidents (Group 1) and control (Group 2). Data were extracted and pooled into a meta-analysis. Results: A total of 895 patients with PFO were reported (Group 1: 493, Group 2: 402). No difference was found in the PFO channel length (Group 1: 10.8 [8.6-12.9] mm vs. Group 2: 10.4 [9.1-11.7] mm), as well as in PFO height measured at rest (Group 1: 2.4 [1.5-3.3] mm vs. Group 2: 1.8 [1.4-2.2] mm). The PFO height measured during a Valsalva maneuver was larger in Group 1 (3.5 [2.8-4.1] mm) than in Group 2 (1.7 [1.2-2.2] mm). Also, the septal excursion distance was found to be larger in Group 1 (6.4 [5.1-7.8] mm) than in Group 2 (3.1 [1.8-4.4] mm). The risk of cerebrovascular accident was higher in patients with PFO and concomitant septal aneurysm (OR 4.00; 95% CI 2.63-6.09; p < 0.001) and with large right-to-left shunt PFO (OR 3.81; 95% CI 2.21-6.55; p < 0.001), no such relationship was found for the presence of a Eustachian valve or Chiari's network (OR 1.90; 95% CI 0.90-4.05; p = 0.094). Conclusions: The TEE may help in identifying PFO that are of high risk of cerebrovascular accident. Greater PFO height during a Valsalva maneuver, larger septal excursion distance, concomitant atrial septal aneurysm, and large right-to-left shunt are associated with stroke-related PFOs. © 2020 S.

Reprint of “Metabolome Wide Association Study of Serum Poly and Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs) in Pregnancy and Early Postpartum”,"Hu X., Li S., Cirillo P.M., Krigbaum N.Y., Tran V., Jones D.P., Cohn B.A.",2020,Reproductive Toxicology,"High-resolution metabolomics (HRM) profiling of metabolic fingerprints can improve understanding of how poly and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) induce metabolic alterations of in utero environment and impact fetal health. HRM profiling and quantification of PFASs were performed for 397 maternal perinatal serum samples collected from 1959-1967 in the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS). We used Metabolome-Wide Association Studies (MWAS) and pathway enrichment analysis for metabolic associations with PFOS, its precursor EtFOSAA, and EtFOSAA-to-PFOS ratio. Distinct metabolic profiles were found with EtFOSAA and PFOS. Urea cycle metabolites such as arginine, lysine and creatine had opposite associations with EtFOSAA (negative) and PFOS (positive); whereas, carnitine shuttle metabolites were found to be exclusively and positively associated with PFOS indicating perturbation in fatty acid metabolism. These differential metabolic associations for precursor and end-product represent an important first step in identifying how PFASs alter the in utero environment and potentially leads to disease risk. © 2020",breast cancer; CHDS; EtFOSAA; in utero; metabolomics; PFOS,2 (n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid; 2 (n methyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid; industrial chemical; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorododecanoic acid; perfluoroheptanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonamide; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; adult; amino acid metabolism; Article; blood level; blood sampling; chemical analysis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental exposure; ethnic difference; fatty acid metabolism; female; high performance liquid chromatography; human; lipid metabolism; mass spectrometry; metabolomics; pregnancy; puerperium; randomized controlled trial; risk assessment,Elsevier Inc.
Understanding mixed environmental exposures using metabolomics via a hierarchical community network model in a cohort of California women in 1960’s,"Li S., Cirillo P., Hu X., Tran V., Krigbaum N., Yu S., Jones D.P., Cohn B.",2020,Reproductive Toxicology,"Even though the majority of population studies in environmental health focus on a single factor, environmental exposure in the real world is a mixture of many chemicals. The concept of “exposome” leads to an intellectual framework of measuring many exposures in humans, and the emerging metabolomics technology offers a means to read out both the biological activity and environmental impact in the same dataset. How to integrate exposome and metabolome in data analysis is still challenging. Here, we employ a hierarchical community network to investigate the global associations between the metabolome and mixed exposures including DDTs, PFASs and PCBs, in a women cohort with sera collected in California in the 1960s. Strikingly, this analysis revealed that the metabolite communities associated with the exposures were non-specific and shared among exposures. This suggests that a small number of metabolic phenotypes may account for the response to a large class of environmental chemicals. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Breast cancer; DDT; Exposome; Gene environment interaction; Hierarchical community network; Metabolic phenotype; Metabolomics; Mixed exposures; Multi-omics integration; MWAS; PCB; PFAS; Variance analysis,"alkyl group; biphenyl derivative; chlorphenotane; perfluoroalkyl substance; polychlorinated biphenyl compound; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; adult; algorithm; Article; blood analysis; breast cancer; California; cancer risk; cohort analysis; community care; community structure; concentration (parameter); environmental exposure; exposome; female; genotype environment interaction; hierarchical community network model; human; major clinical study; metabolomics; phenotype; progeny; women's health; epidemiology; metabolome; metabolomics; California; Cohort Studies; Exposome; Female; Humans; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Neural Networks, Computer",Elsevier Inc.

Embryo bioassays with aquatic animals for toxicity testing and hazard assessment of emerging pollutants: A review,"Capela R., Garric J., Castro L.F.C., Santos M.M.",2020,Science of the Total Environment,"This review article gathers the available information on the use of embryo-tests as high-throughput tools for toxicity screening, hazard assessment and prioritization of new and existing chemical compounds. The approach is contextualized considering the new legal trends for animal experimentation, fostering the 3R policy, with reduction of experimental animals, addressing the potential of embryo-tests as high-throughput toxicity screening and prioritizing tools. Further, the current test guidelines, such as the ones provided by OECD and EPA, focus mainly in a limited number of animal lineages, particularly vertebrates and arthropods. To extrapolate hazard assessment to the ecosystem scale, a larger diversity of taxa should be tested. The use of new experimental animal models in toxicity testing, from a representative set of taxa, was thoroughly revised and discussed in this review. Here, we critically review current tools and the main advantages and drawbacks of different animal models and set researcher priorities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Biodiversity; Embryo-bioassay; Molecular resources; Risk assessment; Toxicity test,Biodiversity; Biohazards; Chemical hazards; Risk assessment; Toxicity; Animal experimentation; Aquatic animals; Emerging pollutants; Experimental animals; Hazard Assessment; Molecular resources; Toxicity test; Toxicity testing; Animals; aquatic organism; bioassay; biodiversity; embryo; hazard assessment; molecular ecology; pollutant; prioritization; toxicity test; animal experiment; animal model; bioassay; biodiversity; ecosystem; embryo; hazard assessment; nonhuman; pollutant; review; risk assessment; toxicity testing; animal; pollutant; risk assessment; toxicity testing; Animalia; Arthropoda; Vertebrata; Animals; Biological Assay; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollutants; Risk Assessment; Toxicity Tests,Elsevier B.V.
Perfluorooctane sulfonate alters gut microbiota-host metabolic homeostasis in mice,"Zhang L., Rimal B., Nichols R.G., Tian Y., Smith P.B., Hatzakis E., Chang S.-C., Butenhoff J.L., Peters J.M., Patterson A.D.",2020,Toxicology,"Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a persistent environmental chemical whose biological effects are mediated by multiple mechanisms. Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiome may be directly impacted by and/or alter the fate and effects of environmental chemicals in the host. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether PFOS influences the gut microbiome and its metabolism, and the host metabolome. Four groups of male C57BL/6 J mice were fed a diet with or without 0.003 %, 0.006 %, or 0.012 % PFOS, respectively. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metabolomic, and molecular analyses were used to examine the gut microbiota of mice after dietary PFOS exposure. Dietary PFOS exposure caused a marked change in the gut microbiome compared to controls. Dietary PFOS also caused dose-dependent changes in hepatic metabolic pathways including those involved in lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, TCA cycle, glucose, and amino acid metabolism. Changes in the metabolome correlated with changes in genes that regulate these pathways. Integrative analyses also demonstrated a strong correlation between the alterations in microbiota composition and host metabolic profiles induced by PFOS. Further, using isolated mouse cecal contents, PFOS exposure directly affected the gut microbiota metabolism. Results from these studies demonstrate that the molecular and biochemical changes induced by PFOS are mediated in part by the gut microbiome, which alters gene expression and the host metabolome in mice. © 2020",Metabolism; Metabolome; Microbiome; Perfluorooctane sulfonate,"perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; RNA 16S; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; RNA 16S; amino acid metabolism; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; cecum; citric acid cycle; controlled study; gene sequence; glucose metabolism; homeostasis; host; inflammation; intestine flora; lipid metabolism; male; metabolomics; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; animal; biosynthesis; C57BL mouse; diet; dose response; drug effect; genetics; homeostasis; intestine flora; liver; metabolism; metabolome; microbiology; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Cecum; Diet; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Fluorocarbons; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Homeostasis; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",Elsevier Ireland Ltd
In utero exposure to persistent and nonpersistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals and anogenital distance. A systematic review of epidemiological studies,"Nelson W., Liu D.-Y., Yang Y., Zhong Z.-H., Wang Y.-X., Ding Y.-B.",2020,Biology of Reproduction,"Anti-androgenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can cross the placenta to modify early offspring sexual dimorphic markers. These changes are linked to anogenital distance (AGD), which is an androgen-sensitive anthropometric parameter used as a biomarker of perineal growth and caudal migration of the genital tubercle. This review aimed to summarize strength of evidence for associations of in utero exposure to EDCs with AGD and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature so as to inform future research. We performed an electronic search of English literature in September 2019 in medical literature analysis and retrieval system online (MEDLINE), Web of Science and Toxline. We included epidemiological studies that examined in utero exposure to persistent and nonpersistent EDCs and considered AGD in offspring as an outcome. Our review contained 16 investigations examining exposure to persistent EDCs (nine studies) and nonpersistent EDCs (seven studies). Some individual studies reported an inverse association between exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), dioxins, perfluoroalkyl substances, and organochlorides and AGD in both male and female offspring. Meta-analysis of three studies found a small reduction of AGD in female offspring exposed to BPA. The number of studies per chemical is small, and number of subjects examined is limited; so, replication of these results is needed. To achieve more specificity and better replication of results, future studies should establish the association of nonpersistent EDCs using multiple urine samples, evaluate the cumulative impact of exposure to a mixture of anti-androgenic chemicals, and offer adequate consideration of more maternal- and children-related confounding factors. © 2019 The Author(s).

Teflon™ or Ivalon®: a scoping review of implants used in microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia,"Pressman E., Jha R.T., Zavadskiy G., Kumar J.I., van Loveren H., van Gompel J.J., Agazzi S.",2020,Neurosurgical Review,"Background: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is characterized by jolts of pain along the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. If patients fail conservative management, microvascular decompression (MVD) is the next step in treatment. MVD is largely done by placing implant pads between the nerve and compressing vessels. We conducted a literature review to assess effectiveness and safety of Teflon™ and Ivalon® sponges for treatment of TN with MVD. Methods: In January 2019, PubMed was searched for manuscripts published in English using permutations of “Microvascular decompression”, “Teflon”, “Ivalon”, “Granuloma”, “Polytetrafluoroethylene”, “Trigeminal Neuralgia”, and “Exploration”. Success and relapse rates, causes of relapse, and complication rates were analyzed. We analyzed for relationships with ANCOVA at an alpha threshold of.05. Results: Thirty-six studies representing 4273 patients fit inclusion criteria. Twenty-five dealt with initial MVD, 12 with re-do MVD. Initial MVD initial success rates were 85% in patients receiving Teflon™ (57–100%*) and 91% in patients receiving Ivalon® (79–100%*). Recurrence rates were 12% in Teflon™ patients (0*–30%) and 9.1% in Ivalon® patients (0*–19%). In patients with relapses, implants were the cause in 49% of Teflon™ patients (0*–100%*) and 50% of Ivalon® patients (0*–100%*). Complication rates for patients receiving Teflon™ were 12% (0*–34%) and 19% for patients receiving Ivalon® (0*–40%). Conclusion: Teflon™ and Ivalon® are two materials used in MVD for TN. It is an effective treatment with long-term symptom relief and recurrence rates of 1–5% each year. Ivalon® has been used less than Teflon™ though is associated with similar success rates and similar complication rates. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Ivalon; Microvascular decompression; Teflon; Trigeminal neuralgia,politef; polyvinyl acetate; biomaterial; politef; polyvinyl alcohol sponge; polyvinyl derivative; analgesia; brain edema; clinical effectiveness; clinical evaluation; clinical practice; cranial nerve injury; device safety; facial nerve paralysis; follow up; hearing impairment; human; liquorrhea; lung embolism; microvascular decompression; pneumonia; postoperative complication; priority journal; recurrence risk; reoperation; Review; risk assessment; surgical infection; treatment outcome; trigeminus neuralgia; urinary tract infection; adverse device effect; comparative study; microvascular decompression; procedures; stent; trigeminus neuralgia; Biocompatible Materials; Humans; Microvascular Decompression Surgery; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Polyvinyls; Reoperation; Stents; Treatment Outcome; Trigeminal Neuralgia,Springer
A review on recent developments in the adsorption of surfactants from wastewater,"Siyal A.A., Shamsuddin M.R., Low A., Rabat N.E.",2020,Journal of Environmental Management,"The pollution of the world's water resources is a growing issue which requires remediation. Surfactants used in many domestic and industrial applications are one of the emerging contaminants that require immediate attention. Treating water contaminated with surfactants using adsorption provides better performance when compared to other techniques. A variety of materials have been developed for adsorbing surfactants. Activated carbon is the most suitable adsorbent for removing surfactants but is expensive to synthesize and difficult to regenerate. Therefore, a variety of new adsorbents such as zeolites, nanomaterials, resins, biomaterials and clays have been developed as alternatives. The developed adsorbents are promising but considerable research is still required to develop highly efficient, economical, environment friendly and sustainable adsorbents to replace activated carbon. This paper critically reviews the characteristics of adsorbents, the performance of adsorbents, kinetics, isotherms and thermodynamics, mechanisms of adsorption, regeneration of adsorbents and future perspectives in the adsorption of surfactants. Developing novel adsorbents, testing adsorbents in real wastewaters and recycling the adsorbents are required in future studies in the removal of surfactants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Adsorption; Emerging pollutants; Mechanism; Surfactants; Wastewater,"activated carbon; adsorbent; aluminum oxide; carbon; cellulose; chitosan; iron oxide; nanomaterial; resin; silica gel; surfactant; tannin; zeolite; surfactant; adsorption; chemical pollutant; crustal recycling; detection method; pollutant removal; recycling; wastewater; wastewater treatment; adsorption; adsorption kinetics; diffusion; gel; hazard; hydrogen bond; hydrophobicity; ion exchange; isotherm; pinus tannin gel; regeneration; Review; static electricity; thermodynamics; waste water management; waste water recycling; adsorption; waste water; water management; water pollutant; Adsorption; Surface-Active Agents; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Academic Press
External validation of ELASTIC NET regression models including newborn metabolomic markers for postnatal gestational age estimation in East and South-East Asian infants,"Hawken S., Murphy M.S.Q., Ducharme R., Bota A.B., Wilson L.A., Cheng W., Tumulak M.-A., Alcausin M.M.L., Reyes M.E., Qiu W., Potter B.K., Little J., Walker M., Zhang L., Padilla C., Chakraborty P., Wilson K.",2020,Gates Open Research,"Background: Postnatal gestational age (GA) algorithms derived from newborn metabolic profiles have emerged as a novel method of acquiring population-level preterm birth estimates in low resource settings. To date, model development and validation have been carried out in North American settings. Validation outside of these settings is warranted. Methods: This was a retrospective database study using data from newborn screening programs in Canada, the Philippines and China. ELASTICNET machine learning models were developed to estimate GA in a cohort of infants from Canada using sex, birth weight and metabolomic markers from newborn heel prick blood samples. Final models were internally validated in an independent group of infants, and externally validated in cohorts of infants from the Philippines and China. Results: Cohorts included 39,666 infants from Canada, 82,909 from the Philippines and 4,448 from China. For the full model including sex, birth weight and metabolomic markers, GA estimates were within 5 days of ultrasound values in the Canadian internal validation (mean absolute error (MAE) 0.71, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.72), and within 6 days of ultrasound GA in both the Filipino (0.90 (0.90, 0.91)) and Chinese cohorts (0.89 (0.86, 0.92)). Despite the decreased accuracy in external settings, our models incorporating metabolomic markers performed better than the baseline model, which relied on sex and birth weight alone. In preterm and growth-restricted infants, the accuracy of metabolomic models was markedly higher than the baseline model. Conclusions: Accuracy of metabolic GA algorithms was attenuated when applied in external settings. Models including metabolomic markers demonstrated higher accuracy than models using sex and birth weight alone. As innovators look to take this work to scale, further investigation of modeling and data normalization techniques will be needed to improve robustness and generalizability of metabolomic GA estimates in low resource settings, where this could have the most clinical utility. © 2020 Hawken S et al.",Biological modelling; Gestational age; Newborn screening; Preterm birth,alanine; apolipoprotein C2; arginine; biological marker; biotinidase; c0; c10; c16; c18; c2; c3; c3d6; c5; c5d6; c6; c8; carbon; carbon 14; citrulline; cyclosporine; galactose 1 phosphate uridylyltransferase; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; glycine; hemoglobin; hemoglobin A; hemoglobin F; hydroxyprogesterone; leucine; marker; metabolomic marker; methionine; ornithine; phenylalanine; thyrotropin; tyrosine; unclassified drug; valine; adult; Article; bibliographic database; birth weight; blood sampling; Canada; Chinese; computer model; congenital adrenal hyperplasia; data accuracy; elastic net regression model; female; Filipino (people); gestational age; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; human; hypothyroidism; infant; machine learning; major clinical study; male; newborn; newborn screening; phenylketonuria; postnatal gestational age; prick test; regression analysis; retrospective study; Southeast Asian; tandem mass spectrometry; theory validation; ultrasound,F1000 Research Ltd
Birth weight and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid: A random-effects meta-regression analysis,"Dzierlenga M.W., Crawford L., Longnecker M.P.",2020,Environmental Epidemiology,"Background: Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant. Most people in developed countries have detectable serum concentrations. Lower birth weight has been associated with serum PFOS in studies world-wide, many of which have been published only recently. Methods: To facilitate a causal assessment of the birth weight and PFOS association, we updated previous meta-analyses of the association and employed a method that facilitated inclusion of all available data in one analysis. Our analysis was based on observations from 29 studies. Results: The random effects summary was -3.22 g/ng/ml (95% confidence interval [CI] = -5.11, -1.33). In a subgroup analysis stratified by when in pregnancy the PFOS concentration was measured, the summary for the early group was -1.35 (95% CI = -2.33, -0.37) and for the later group was -7.17 (95% CI = -10.93, -3.41). In a meta-regression model including a term for timing of blood draw, the intercept was slightly positive but essentially zero (0.59 g/ng/ml, 95% CI = -1.94, 3.11). In other words, the model indicated that when blood was drawn at the very beginning of pregnancy, there was essentially no relation of birth weight to PFOS. The results from the subgroup analyses differed from those from the model because the average gestational age at blood draw in the early group was 14 weeks, when bias would still be expected. A stronger inverse association in Asian studies was not completely explained by their blood draws being from later in pregnancy. Conclusions: The evidence was weakly or not supportive of a causal association. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health.

Photothermal therapies to improve immune checkpoint blockade for cancer,"Balakrishnan P.B., Sweeney E.E., Ramanujam A.S., Fernandes R.",2020,International Journal of Hyperthermia,"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) comprising monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against immune ‘checkpoints’, such as CTLA-4 and the PD1/PDL1 axis have dramatically improved clinical outcomes for patients with cancer. However, ICB by itself has failed to provide benefit in a wide range of solid tumors, where recurrence still occurs with high incidence. These poor response rates may be due to the therapeutic shortcomings of ICB; namely, a lack of cancer-specific cytotoxicity and ability to debulk tumors. To overcome these limitations, effective ICB therapy may require the combination with other complementary therapeutic platforms. Here, we propose that photothermal therapy (PTT) is an ideal therapeutic modality for combination with ICB because it can generate both tumor-specific cytotoxicity and immunogenicity. PTT elicits these specific effects because it is a localized thermal ablation technique that utilizes light-responsive nanoparticles activated by a wavelength-matched laser. While ICB immunotherapy alone improves cancer immunogenicity but does not generate robust antitumor cytotoxicity, nanoparticle-based PTT elicits targeted and controlled cytotoxicity but sub-optimal long-term immunogenicity. Thus, the two platforms offer complementary and potentially synergistic antitumor effects, which will be detailed in this review. We highlight three classes of nanoparticles used as agents of PTT (i.e., metallic inorganic nanoparticles, carbon-based nanoparticles and organic dyes), and illustrate the potential for nanoparticle-based PTT to potentiate the effects of ICB in preclinical models. Through this discussion, we aim to present PTT combined with ICB as a potent synergistic combination treatment for diverse cancer types currently refractory to ICB as well as PTT monotherapies. © 2021 The Author(s).

Introduction and Historical Findings That Focused Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs as Emerging Pollutant,"Elizalde-Velázquez G.A., Gómez-Oliván L.M.",2020,Handbook of Environmental Chemistry,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most consumed pharmaceuticals worldwide due to their significant anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. These drugs are mainly excreted from the body in their metabolized form and may enter into the environment through different pathways. In wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), these contaminants are mainly removed by biological treatment processes. However, even after these treatments, high concentrations of these drugs have been found in WWTPs effluents, surface water, and drinking water. NSAIDs are likely to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms such as Mytilus galloprovincialis. Furthermore, toxic effects such as oxidative stress, developmental abnormalities, hepatotoxicity, immunosuppressive effects, and hematological alterations have been found in several freshwater species exposed to these pollutants. Therefore, NSAIDs are a threat to the human being as well as to our environment. This review comprehensively discusses the worldwide consumption of NSAIDs, their occurrence in the aquatic environments, and the toxic effects produced by these drugs in nontarget organisms. This is to raise awareness of the negative consequences of their occurrence in freshwater ecosystems and promote the creation of new alternatives for their removal from water. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Fate; NSAIDs; Occurrence; Toxic effects,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
Anesthetic Considerations in Facial Transplantation: Experience at NYU Langone Health and Systematic Review,"Alfonso A.R., Ramly E.P., Kantar R.S., Rifkin W.J., Diaz-Siso J.R., Gelb B.E., Yeh J.S., Espina M.F., Jain S.K., Piper G.L., Rodriguez E.D.",2020,Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery - Global Open,"Background: Anesthetic considerations are integral to the success of facial transplantation (FT), yet limited evidence exists to guide quality improvement. This study presents an institutional anesthesia protocol, defines reported anesthetic considerations, and provides a comprehensive update to inform future directions of the field. Methods: An institutional ""FT Anesthesia Protocol""was developed and applied to 2 face transplants. A systematic review of 3 databases captured FTs in the peer-reviewed literature up to February 2020. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts to include all clinical articles with FT recipient and/or donor-specific preoperative, intraoperative, and relevant postoperative anesthetic variables. Data charting guided a narrative synthesis, and quantitative synthesis reported variables as median (range). Results: Our institutional experience emphasizes the importance of on-site rehearsals, anticipation of patient-specific anesthetic and resuscitative requirements, and long-term pain management. Systematic search identified 1092 unique records, and 129 met inclusion criteria. Reports of 37 FTs in the literature informed the following anesthetic axes: donor pre- and intraoperative management during facial allograft procurement, recipient perioperative care, immunotherapy, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and pain management. Quantitative synthesis of 30 articles showed a median operative time of 18 hours (range, 9-28) and fluid replacement with 13 L (5-18) of crystalloids, 13 units (0-66) of packed red blood cells, 10 units (0-63) of fresh frozen plasma, and 1 unit (0-9) of platelets. Conclusions: Anesthetic considerations in FT span the continuum of care. Future efforts should guide standard reporting to establish evidence-based strategies that promote quality improvement and patient safety. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and their effects on the ovary,"Ding N., Harlow S.D., Randolph J.F., Jr., Loch-Caruso R., Park S.K.",2020,Human Reproduction Update,"BACKGROUND: Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are found widespread in drinking water, foods, food packaging materials and other consumer products. Several PFAS have been identified as endocrine-disrupting chemicals based on their ability to interfere with normal reproductive function and hormonal signalling. Experimental models and epidemiologic studies suggest that PFAS exposures target the ovary and represent major risks for women's health. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: This review summarises human population and toxicological studies on the association between PFAS exposure and ovarian function. SEARCH METHODS: A comprehensive review was performed by searching PubMed. Search terms included an extensive list of PFAS and health terms ranging from general keywords (e.g. ovarian, reproductive, follicle, oocyte) to specific keywords (including menarche, menstrual cycle, menopause, primary ovarian insufficiency/premature ovarian failure, steroid hormones), based on the authors' knowledge of the topic and key terms. OUTCOMES: Clinical evidence demonstrates the presence of PFAS in follicular fluid and their ability to pass through the blood-follicle barrier. Although some studies found no evidence associating PFAS exposure with disruption in ovarian function, numerous epidemiologic studies, mostly with cross-sectional study designs, have identified associations of higher PFAS exposure with later menarche, irregular menstrual cycles, longer cycle length, earlier age of menopause and reduced levels of oestrogens and androgens. Adverse effects of PFAS on ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis have been confirmed in experimental models. Based on laboratory research findings, PFAS could diminish ovarian reserve and reduce endogenous hormone synthesis through activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, disrupting gap junction intercellular communication between oocyte and granulosa cells, inducing thyroid hormone deficiency, antagonising ovarian enzyme activities involved in ovarian steroidogenesis or inhibiting kisspeptin signalling in the hypothalamus. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The published literature supports associations between PFAS exposure and adverse reproductive outcomes; however, the evidence remains insufficient to infer a causal relationship between PFAS exposure and ovarian disorders. Thus, more research is warranted. PFAS are of significant concern because these chemicals are ubiquitous and persistent in the environment and in humans. Moreover, susceptible groups, such as foetuses and pregnant women, may be exposed to harmful combinations of chemicals that include PFAS. However, the role environmental exposures play in reproductive disorders has received little attention by the medical community. To better understand the potential risk of PFAS on human ovarian function, additional experimental studies using PFAS doses equivalent to the exposure levels found in the general human population and mixtures of compounds are required. Prospective investigations in human populations are also warranted to ensure the temporality of PFAS exposure and health endpoints and to minimise the possibility of reverse causality. © The Author(s) 2020.

"Flammability standards for furniture, building insulation and electronics: Benefit and risk","Charbonnet J.A., Weber R., Blum A.",2020,Emerging Contaminants,"Flammability standards for furniture, building insulation and electronics were established in an attempt to mitigate fire risk. However, research suggests that some of these flammability standards should be reconsidered. High levels of flame retardant chemicals, primarily organohalogens, are added to these products in order to comply with fire safety standards. Organohalogen and organophosphate flame retardants are associated with adverse health effects such as diminished immune function, endocrine disruption, and cancer. Further, flame retardants may not provide a significant fire safety benefit as used in many products, and these chemicals can hinder material recycling. We reviewed evidence of how flammability standards drive the continued use of harmful flame retardants and investigated cases in which flame retardants are used to achieve standard compliance without providing a significant fire safety benefit. The widespread continuous use of toxic flame retardant chemicals demonstrates that toxicological evidence and chemical-by-chemical regulation alone are not sufficient to prevent their inclusion in consumer products. However, recent experiences show that updated flammability standards can reduce the use of flame retardants while maintaining, or even increasing, fire safety. Additional opportunities exist for improved standards that could further decrease flame retardant use and maintain fire safety. © 2020 The Authors",,,KeAi Communications Co.
Molecular Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Contrast Agents for Assessment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review,"Luo Y., Gao C., Chen W., Zhou K., Xu M.",2020,Contrast Media and Molecular Imaging,"Background and Aims. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has taken an important role in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In the wake of current advances in nanotechnology, the drug delivery industry has seen a surge of nanoparticles advertising high specificity in target imaging. Given the rapid development of the field, this review has assembled related articles to explore whether molecular contrast agents can improve the diagnostic capability on gastrointestinal imaging, especially for IBD. Methods. Relevant articles published between 1998 and 2018 from a literature search of PubMed and EMBASE were reviewed. Data extraction was performed on the studies' characteristics, experimental animals, modelling methods, nanoparticles type, magnetic resonance methods, and means of quantitative analysis. Results. A total of 8 studies were identified wherein the subjects were animals, and all studies employed MR equipment. One group utilized a perfluorocarbon solution and the other 7 groups used either magnetic nanoparticles or gadolinium- (Gd-) related nanoparticles for molecular contrast. With ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles and Gd-related nanoparticles, signal enhancements were found in the mucosa or with focal lesion of IBD-related model in T1-weighted images (T1WI), whereas superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles showed a signal decrease in the intestinal wall of the model in T1WI or T2-weighted images. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was employed to analyze bowel intensity in 3 studies. And the percentage of normalized enhancement was used in 1 study for assessing the severity of inflammation. Conclusion. Molecular MRI with contrast agents can improve the early diagnosis of IBD and quantitate the severity of inflammation in experimental studies. © 2020 Yifan Luo et al.",,"casein; chitosan nanoparticle; contrast medium; fluorescein isothiocyanate; fluorocarbon; gadolinium; gadolinium pentetate; indocyanine green; macrogol; magnetic nanoparticle; nanoparticle; superparamagnetic iron oxide; contrast medium; gadolinium; adenoma; disease assessment; disease association; dysplasia; early diagnosis; endocytosis; image analysis; image quality; inflammatory bowel disease; intestine epithelium cell; intestine wall; macrophage; macrophage migration; molecular imaging; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Review; signal noise ratio; single photon emission computed tomography; systematic review (topic); animal; C57BL mouse; chemistry; diagnostic imaging; human; inflammatory bowel disease; molecular imaging; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Contrast Media; Gadolinium; Humans; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Molecular Imaging; Nanoparticles; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",Hindawi Limited
Physiotherapy and pelvic floor muscle exercises for the prevention and treatment of pregnancy-related pelvic floor dysfunctions: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Khorasani F., Ghaderi F., Sarbakhsh P., Ahadi P., Khorasani E., Ansari F., Vahed N.",2020,International Journal of Women's Health and Reproduction Sciences,"Objectives: The present systematic review focused on the prevention or treatment of three main types of pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFDs) specifically pelvic organ prolapse (POP), urinary incontinence (UI), and fecal incontinence (FI) using physiotherapy and pelvic floor muscle exercises (PFMEs). With regard to the breadth of the problem, there is not much evidence grounded on the best management. The main purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of physiotherapy and PFMEs on the prevention and treatment of pregnancy-related PFDs; namely, POP, FI, and UI. Therefore, this review incorporated studies comparing the use of physiotherapy and PFMEs with every other existing interventions. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on randomized-controlled-trial (RCT) articles and quasi-RCT designs through a search in the studies published with no time limits until December 2017 in the databases of PubMed (Medline), Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest. The meta-analysis was also applied for data synthesis. Moreover, heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran’s Q test and I2 index. Results: A total number of 26 RCTs were examined in this review in which the outcome variables were related to POP, UI, and FI prevalence; POP, UI, and FI severity, as well as pelvic floor muscle (PFM) strength and endurance. In most articles, UI prevalence or severity in intervention groups had significantly improved compared with those in controls. The number of studies examining POP and FI was also relatively low. In two studies, FI severity or prevalence in intervention groups had significantly enhanced in comparison with those in control groups; however, FI prevalence in two articles had been reported lower in intervention groups than that in control groups although no significant difference had been observed. There was also no significant improvement in intervention groups in two other studies in this respect. Besides, three articles had not reported traces of improvement in POP, as well as a significant difference between intervention and control groups. Nevertheless, two studies had found a significant improvement in POP in this regard. Based on meta-analysis results for the variable of PFM strength, Cochran’s Q test (P &lt; 0.001) and I2 index (90.02) indicated heterogeneity between studies; so, a random-effect meta-analysis was applied to estimate overall effect sizes. The overall mean differences following intervention between the study groups were also equal to 6.94, with a 95% CI (1.36 to 12.52). Conclusions: It was concluded that physiotherapy and PFMEs might have effects on pregnancy-related UI, but they had not consistently reduced FI severity or prevalence and failed to constantly improve POP. © 2020 The Author(s).",Fecal incontinence; Pelvic floor muscle exercise; Pelvic organ prolapse; Physiotherapy; Urinary incontinence,disease severity; feces incontinence; human; meta analysis; muscle exercise; muscle strength; pelvic floor disorder; pelvic floor muscle training; pelvic organ prolapse; perinatal period; physiotherapy; pregnancy; pregnancy disorder; prenatal period; puerperium; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; second trimester pregnancy; systematic review; third trimester pregnancy; urine incontinence,Aras Part Medical International Press
Genomic epidemiology of an outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae st471 producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases in a neonatal intensive care unit,"Wang Y., Luo C., Du P., Hu J., Zhao X., Mo D., Du X., Xu X., Li M., Lu H., Zhou Z., Cui Z., Zhou H.",2020,Infection and Drug Resistance,"Purpose: Klebsiella pneumoniae producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) causes nosocomial infections worldwide. The present study aimed to determine the molecular subtyping characteristics and antibiotic resistance mechanisms of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains collected during an outbreak. Moreover, we attempted to reveal the fine transmission route of the strains within this outbreak using whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Methods: Collecting cases and strain information were carried out. Outbreak-related strains were identified using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The antibiotic susceptibility, drug-resistant genes, and molecular subtype characteristics of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae were analyzed. The fine transmission route of the strains within this outbreak was revealed using WGS and minimum core genome (MCG) sequence typing. Results: In mid-January, 2015, five cases of neonatal pneumonia caused by ESBLproducing K. pneumoniae were observed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the Affiliated Hospital of Chifeng University, China. Eight ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae were isolated from these five cases, and two additional strains from another two cases were identified using PFGE. All ten isolates harbored blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1, blaSHV-108, and blaOXA-1 genes, and belonged to the sequence type 471 (ST471) clone. A putative transmission map was constructed via comprehensive consideration of genomic and epidemiological information. WGS identified the initial case and the “superspreader”. The genomic epidemiological investigation revealed that the outbreak was caused by the introduction of the bacteria one month before the first case appeared. Conclusion: As far as we know, this is the first report to describe the characteristics of an ST471 ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae outbreak. The data showed that epidemiological inferences could be greatly improved by interpretation in the context of WGS and that K. pneumoniae strains isolated from the same outbreak contain sufficient genomic differences to refine epidemiological linkages on the basis of genetic lineage. These findings suggested that integration of genomic and epidemiological data can help us to have a clearer understanding of when and how outbreaks occur, so as to better control nosocomial transmission. © 2020 Wang et al.",Minimum core genome; Superspreader; Transmission; Whole-genome sequencing,amikacin; aminoglycoside; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; ampicillin; azithromycin; aztreonam; beta lactamase TEM 1; cefazolin; cefepime; cefotaxime; cefoxitin; ceftazidime; chloramphenicol; ciprofloxacin; colistin; cotrimoxazole; doxycycline; extended spectrum beta lactamase; fosfomycin; imipenem; kanamycin; levofloxacin; meropenem; polymyxin; sulfonamide; sultamicillin; tetracycline; tigecycline; trimethoprim; unindexed drug; aac 3 II gene; aac 6 Ib gene; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; aph 33 Ib gene; aph 6 Id gene; arnA gene; Article; bacA gene; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterial transmission; bacterium isolation; blaCTX M 15 gene; blaOXA 1 gene; blaSHV 108 gene; blaTEM 1 gene; catB3 gene; China; clinical article; dfrA14 gene; dfrA22 gene; epidemic; fosA gene; human; Klebsiella pneumoniae; minimum core genome sequence typing; molecular biology; molecular subtyping; neonatal intensive care unit; neonatal pneumonia; newborn; nonhuman; protein synthesis; pulsed field gel electrophoresis; single nucleotide polymorphism; strain identification; sul2 gene; whole genome sequencing,Dove Medical Press Ltd.
Serum metabolomic patterns in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease,"Liu J., Fu J., Jia Y., Yang N., Li J., Wang G.",2020,Endocrine Practice,"Objective: Autoimmune thyroid disease, including Graves disease (GD) and Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT), is one of the most common endocrine diseases. GD and HT are the main etiologies for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, respectively. This study aimed to provide a metabolomic analysis of GD patients with hyperthyroidism and HT patients with hypothyroidism. Methods: This study investigated serum metabolomics in 43 GD patients with hyperthyroidism, 45 HT patients with hypothyroidism, and 52 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The metabolomic data were analyzed by performing multivariate statistical analysis. Results: The 186 metabolites including amino acids, bile acids, free fatty acids, and lipids were identified in all participants. Multivariate models indicated systematic differences in the hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and control groups. Compared to healthy controls, the 22 metabolites in the hyperthyroidism group and the 17 metabolites in the hypothyroidism group were significantly changed. Pathway analysis showed that hyperthyroidism had a significant impact on arginine and proline metabolism and aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid biosynthesis, while hypothyroidism had a significant impact on alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. Conclusion: The serum metabolomic pattern changes in patients with autoimmune thyroid dysfunction.

A Highly Selective and Sensitive Fluorescent Turn-Off Probe for Al3+ Based on Polypyrimidine,"Maimaiti Y., Maimaitiyiming X.",2020,Fibers and Polymers,"The polyfluorene copolymers with different pyrimidine content has been synthesized and characterized by 1HNMR, 13CNMR and FT-IR spectrum. The aggregation, acidochromicity, and metallochromicity of copolymers has been investigated. The pyrimidine content of polymer has great affect in acidochromic properties for methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and selectivity for Al3+. The colour change of copolymer/Al3+ complexes can be detected by the naked eye. The copolymers are found to be good linearly proportional to the concentration of Al3+ ions in a range from 1.0×10-6 to 1.0×10-3 M with a detection limit of 1.895×10-8 M.

Association between exposure to persistent organic pollutants during pregnancy and thyroid function during childhood : a pilot longitudinal study and literature review [Associations entre exposition aux polluants organiques persistants durant la grossesse et fonction thyroïdienne durant la petite enfance : étude longitudinale pilote et revue de la littérature],"Dufour P., Pirard C., Seghaye M.C., Boemer F., Charlier C.",2020,Revue medicale de Liege,"OBJECTIVE: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are chemicals widely employed in the industry. Long term consequences of the newborns' contamination by PFAS on thyroid function are of concern. The aim of this study is to assess the potential associations between PFAS contamination measured at birth and thyroid function assessed few months later. PFAS levels were previously determined in cord blood from a cohort of newborns recruited in Liege. METHOD: Parents of the children belonging to the first and the fifth quintiles of exposure to PFAS were contacted in order to measure the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in their child few months after birth. Twenty-eight children participated in the study. Moreover, we performed a literature review about associations between pre- or perinatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants and thyroid function during early childhood. RESULT: No significant difference was highlighted between both groups of contamination (Mann-Whitney, p-value = 0.91). Literature review highlighted the critical need of new longitudinal data about this problematic. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the PFAS levels at birth are not associated with TSH levels later in life. Large scale studies are required to confirm our results.Objectif : Notre but est d’étudier les associations potentielles entre contamination par les composés perfluorés (PFC) mesurée à la naissance et fonction thyroïdienne évaluée quelques mois plus tard. Les niveaux de PFC ont été déterminés précédemment dans le sang de cordon de nouveau-nés recrutés à Liège. Méthode : Les parents des enfants appartenant au premier et cinquième quintiles d’exposition aux PFC ont été contactés pour mesurer les niveaux de thyréostimuline (TSH) chez leurs enfants quelques mois après la naissance. Vingt-huit enfants ont été recrutés. De plus, nous avons réalisé une revue de littérature concernant les associations entre exposition pré- ou périnatale aux polluants organiques persistants (POP) et fonction thyroïdienne pendant la petite enfance. Résultat : Aucune différence significative n’a été mise en évidence entre les deux groupes de contamination (Mann-Whitney, p = 0,91). Selon, la revue de la littérature, il est indispensable de disposer de nouvelles données longitudinales relatives à la relation entre contamination par les POP et fonction thyroïdienne. Conclusion : Nos résultats suggèrent que les concentrations de PFC à la naissance ne sont pas associées aux niveaux de TSH au cours de la vie.

GESgnExt: Gene Expression Signature Extraction and Meta-Analysis on Gene Expression Omnibus,"Yan S., Wong K.-C.",2020,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,"The gene expression omnibus (GEO) repository harbours an exponentially increasing number of gene expression studies. The expression data, as well as the related metadata, provides an abundant resource for knowledge discovery. Each study in GEO focuses on the gene expression perturbation of a specific subject (e.g., gene, drug, and disease). The identification of those subjects and the associations among them are beneficial for further in-depth studies. However, they cannot be directly inferred from the studies. A unified representation of those subjects (i.e., gene expression signatures) is desired. We developed GESgnExt for the automatic construction of gene expression signatures. The resultant 6542 signatures are built on 1934 series and 35 919 samples from GEO. To evaluate its significance, we calculated the similarities among those signatures and compared the discovered associations against the existing interaction databases. The signatures connect the genes, drugs, and diseases, covering most of the experimentally validated interactions. Besides, we have discovered 3307 novel signatures and their related associations, complementing the existing signature knowledge. The biomedical relevance of GESgnExt is demonstrated further in multiple case studies, providing mechanistic insights into its knowledge discovery process. © 2013 IEEE.",biomedical text mining; Gene expression omnibus; gene expression signature; meta-analysis,"Association reactions; Natural language processing systems; Orbits; Automatic construction; Biomedical text minings; Gene expression signatures; Gene expression studies; Interaction database; Knowledge discovery process; Meta analysis; Multiple-case study; Gene expression; carboplatin; cobalt chloride; decitabine; dextro serine; estradiol; fluoxetine; hemoglobin; perfluorooctanoic acid; retinoic acid; antineoplastic agent; adaboost Tree; algorithm; anemia; Article; classification; controlled study; down regulation; extra tree; gene expression; gradient boosting; hierarchical clustering; human; hypertension; mathematical model; meta analysis; molecular interaction; ovary cancer; random forest; support vector machine; upregulation; data mining; database management system; drug resistance; gene expression profiling; genetic database; genetics; genomics; meta analysis (topic); neoplasm; procedures; Antineoplastic Agents; Data Mining; Database Management Systems; Databases, Genetic; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Gene Expression Profiling; Genomics; Humans; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Neoplasms",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
A Review on Evidence-Based Treatments for Meibomian Gland Dysfunction,"Lam P.Y., Shih K.C., Fong P.Y., Chan T.C.Y., Ng A.L.-K., Jhanji V., Tong L.",2020,Eye and Contact Lens,"Objectives:To evaluate recent studies on available therapies for meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD).Methods:A literature search on recent publications, within the last five years, concerning treatment options for MGD was performed.Results:A total of 35 articles were reviewed after curation by the authors for relevance. In general, all modalities of treatments were shown to have clinical efficacy in alleviating dry eye signs and symptoms, although the extent of improvement and persistency of outcomes varied between the different treatments. Evidence from published studies demonstrate that thermal pulsation produces the longest lasting effect per treatment, but it also incurs the highest per-treatment cost. Reusable methods for warm compress with lipid/semi-fluorinated alkane-containing eye drops are recommended as first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate dry eye patients, because this option is most technically feasible and cost-effective in clinical practice. Intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy and thermal pulsation may be suitable as second line for patients unresponsive to warm compress therapy; however, their respective limitations need to be considered. For refractory MGD with features of periductal fibrosis or severe blepharitis, supplementary treatment with meibomian gland probing or oral antibiotics may be used.Conclusions:All eight forms of treatments, including self-applied eyelid warming, thermal pulsation, IPL, MG probing, antibiotics, lipid-containing eye drops, and perfluorohexyloctane, were effective against MGD, although with varying extent of clinical improvements. A better understanding on the mechanisms of actions may guide physicians to make better treatment decisions targeting the root causes.

A Toxicokinetic Framework and Analysis Tool for Interpreting Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Guideline 305 Dietary Bioaccumulation Tests,"Gobas F.A.P.C., Lee Y.-S., Lo J.C., Parkerton T.F., Letinski D.J.",2020,Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guideline 305 for bioaccumulation testing in fish includes the option to conduct a dietary test for assessing a chemical's bioaccumulation behavior. However, the one-compartment toxicokinetic model that is used in the guidelines to analyze the results from dietary bioaccumulation tests is not consistent with the current state of the science, experimental practices, and information needs for bioaccumulation and risk assessment. The present study presents 1) a 2-compartment toxicokinetic modeling framework for describing the bioaccumulation of neutral hydrophobic organic chemicals in fish and 2) an associated toxicokinetic analysis tool (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion [ADME] B calculator) for the analysis and interpretation of dietary bioaccumulation test data from OECD-305 dietary tests. The model framework and ADME-B calculator are illustrated by analysis of fish dietary bioaccumulation test data for 238 substances representing different structural classes and susceptibilities to biotransformation. The ADME of the chemicals is determined from dietary bioaccumulation tests and bioconcentration factors, biomagnification factors, and somatic and intestinal biotransformation rates. The 2-compartment fish toxicokinetic model can account for the effect of the exposure pathway on bioaccumulation, which the one-compartment model cannot. This insight is important for applying a weight-of-evidence approach to bioaccumulation assessment where information from aqueous and dietary test endpoints can be integrated to improve the evaluation of a chemical's bioaccumulation potential.

Recent trends in disposal and treatment technologies of emerging-pollutants- A critical review,"Khan N.A., Khan S.U., Ahmed S., Farooqi I.H., Yousefi M., Mohammadi A.A., Changani F.",2020,TrAC - Trends in Analytical Chemistry,"Recently pharmaceuticals are emerging as a major source of pollution for the environment. It has been well observed that the effluent discharge from hospitals has an eminent quantity of chemical waste as antibiotics, disinfectants and other treatments wastes. Pharmaceutical effluents are bioactive and their existence in the environment has been found harmful to both aquatic life and humans. In developing countries, untreated wastewaters are discharged to local water bodies by just following the local regulations. The current global challenges including high population growth rate and climate change have contributed to the widespread epidemics and emergence of diseases. Besides intractable and decaying antibiotic system, hospitals emit pathogenic waste during treatment process that can lead to situations where a total ban on hospital effluent are needed, for instance in multiple cases where discharge lead to strain on nature and quality of water. In case of pharmaceutical residues, it has been observed that only 18–32% of the pharmaceutical residues could be degraded by the secondary treatment of these seven technologies and it has been increased to 30–65% by tertiary treatment. As far as the pharmaceutical residues are concerned, it has been observed that MBR removes the residues with the efficiency of 28–100%, varying for each pharmaceutical.

"Occurrence, formation, environmental fate and risks of environmentally persistent free radicals in biochars","Odinga E.S., Waigi M.G., Gudda F.O., Wang J., Yang B., Hu X., Li S., Gao Y.",2020,Environment International,"Biochars are used globally in agricultural crop production and environmental remediation. However, environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs), which are stable emerging pollutants, are generated as a characteristic feature during biomass pyrolysis. EPFRs can induce the formation of reactive oxygen species, which poses huge agro-environmental and human health risks. Their half-lives and persistence in both biochar residues and in the atmosphere may lead to potentially adverse risks in the environment. This review highlights the comprehensive research into these bioreactive radicals, as well as the bottlenecks of biochar production leading up to the formation and persistence of EPFRs. Additionally, a way forward has been proposed, based on two main recommendations. A global joint initiative to create an all-encompassing regulations policy document that will improve both the technological and the quality control aspects of biochars to reduce EPFR generation at the production level. Furthermore, environmental impact and risk assessment studies should be conducted in the extensive applications of biochars in order to protect the environmental and human health. The highlighted key research directions proposed herein will shape the production, research, and adoption aspects of biochars, which will mitigate the considerable concerns raised on EPFRs. © 2019 The Authors",Biochar; Environmental fate; Environmentally persistent free radicals; Reactive oxygen species; Risk,Agricultural robots; Crops; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Free radicals; Health risks; Reactive oxygen species; Risk assessment; Risks; Agricultural crops; Bio chars; Comprehensive research; Emerging pollutants; Environmental fate; Environmental remediation; Human health risks; Quality control aspects; Environmental protection; biochar; charcoal; free radical; unclassified drug; biochar; charcoal; free radical; biochar; bioremediation; environmental fate; environmental risk; reactive oxygen species; risk assessment; carbonization; cation exchange; chemical analysis; chemical bond; decomposition; depolymerization; ecosystem restoration; electron spin resonance; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental monitoring; germination; priority journal; pyrolysis; Review; risk assessment; soil acidity; chemistry; ecosystem restoration; human; Charcoal; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Free Radicals; Humans; Pyrolysis,Elsevier Ltd
Impact of Bariatric Surgery on Female Sexual Function in Obese Patients: a Meta-Analysis,"Gao Z., Liang Y., Deng W., Qiu P., Li M., Zhou Z.",2020,Obesity Surgery,"We aimed to make a meta-analysis regarding the effect of bariatric surgery on female sexual function. PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched from database inception through August 2019. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they examined the effect of bariatric surgery on obese women’s sexual function assessed by the Female Sexual Functioning Index (FSFI) or/and the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12). Twenty articles were included into meta-analysis. Bariatric surgery was associated with significant increase in the total FSFI score. When parameters included in the FSFI scoring system were separately evaluated, significant improvements were observed in sexual desire, sexual arousal, lubrication, orgasm, sexual satisfaction, and sexual pain. However, the PISQ-12 and FSFI scores in women with pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) were not significantly changed postoperatively.

Recent advancements in visible-light-assisted photocatalytic removal of aqueous pharmaceutical pollutants,"Majumdar A., Pal A.",2020,Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,"Abstract: Pharmaceuticals are one of the persistent emerging contaminants that are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment due to their extensive application as human and veterinary medicines. The ecotoxicity and microbial resistance are considered to be major adverse environmental and health impact of pharmaceuticals even in trace amounts, which raise global concern. The recalcitrant nature of these pollutants restricts the application of the conventional treatment system for their remediation and triggers extensive research on the various advanced oxidation processes as a promising treatment system. Among them, visible-light-assisted semiconductor photocatalysis has significant potential as an efficient, low-cost, and green technology, which can use even solar energy as a clean and sustainable light source. A comprehensive review on the application of various visible light photocatalysts on the degradation of aqueous pharmaceutical pollutants was attempted to highlight their physiochemical properties, reaction mechanism, and catalytic activity in the laboratory- as well as field-scale operations. The challenges and gaps in the current literature have been identified, and recommendations for prospective research opportunities have been placed based on the findings.

"Occurrence, interactive effects and ecological risk of diclofenac in environmental compartments and biota - a review","Sathishkumar P., Meena R.A.A., Palanisami T., Ashokkumar V., Palvannan T., Gu F.L.",2020,Science of the Total Environment,"Diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug has turned into a contaminant of emerging concern; hence, it was included in the previous Watch List of the EU Water Framework Directive. This review paper aims to highlight the metabolism of diclofenac at different trophic levels, its occurrence, ecological risks, and interactive effects in the water cycle and biota over the past two decades. Increased exposure to diclofenac not only raises health concerns for vultures, aquatic organisms, and higher plants but also causes serious threats to mammals. The ubiquitous nature of diclofenac in surface water (river, lake canal, estuary, and sea) is compared with drinking water, groundwater, and wastewater effluent in the environment. This comprehensive survey from previous studies suggests the fate of diclofenac in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and may predict its persistence in the environment. This review offers evidence of fragmentary available data for the water environment, soil, sediment, and biota worldwide and supports the need for further data to address the risks associated with the presence of diclofenac in the environment. Finally, we suggest that the presence of diclofenac and its metabolites in the environment may represent a high risk because of their synergistic interactions with existing contaminants, leading to the development of drug-resistant strains and the formation of newly emerging pollutants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Diclofenac; Ecological risk; Emerging contaminant; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; Pain killer; Water environment,"Aquatic organisms; Environmental regulations; Groundwater; Health risks; Mammals; Potable water; Surface waters; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Diclofenac; Ecological risks; Emerging contaminant; Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; Pain killer; Water environments; Effluents; 1 (2,6 dichloro 4 hydroxyphenyl) 2 indolinone; 1 (2,6 dichlorophenyl) 5 hydroxy 2 indolinone; 2' hydroxy 3' (glutathione S yl) monoclofenac; 3 hydroxy 4'methoxydiclofenac; 3' hydroxydiclofenac; 3' hydroxydiclofenac acyl glucuronide; 4' glucopyranosyloxy diclofenac; 4' hydroxy 3' (glutathione S yl) monoclofenac; 4' hydroxy glutathionyl diclofenac; 4' hydroxydiclofenac; 4' hydroxydiclofenac acyl glucuronide; 4',5' dihydroxydiclofenac; 5 glucopyranosyloxy diclofenac; 5 hydroxydiclofenac acyl glucuronide; 5 hydroxydiclofenac glucuronide; 5' hydroxydiclofenac; acyl glutamatyl diclofenac; diclofenac; diclofenac 2,5 iminoquinone; diclofenac acyl glucuronide; diclofenac derivative; diclofenac glucuronide; diclofenac glutathione thioester; diclofenac taurine; drinking water; ground water; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; sea water; surface water; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; diclofenac; drug resistance; ecological impact; environmental fate; environmental monitoring; environmental risk; metabolite; pollutant source; surface water; wastewater treatment plant; aquatic environment; aquatic species; biota; controlled study; drug exposure; drug metabolism; drug structure; drug transformation; effluent; environmental factor; estuary; European Union; high risk patient; hydrophilicity; lake; metabolite; pollutant; priority journal; Review; river; sea; sediment; soil analysis; waste water; waste water management; water cycle; environmental monitoring; Embryophyta; Mammalia; Biota; Diclofenac; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants",Elsevier B.V.
Metabolomic analysis reveals metabolic alterations of human peripheral blood lymphocytes by perfluorooctanoic acid,"Li R., Guo C., Tse W.K.F., Su M., Zhang X., Lai K.P.",2020,Chemosphere,"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a dispersive persistent organic pollutant in the environment. Accumulating reports suggest that PFOA is toxic to human lymphocytes; however, the toxicological effects of PFOA on these cells remain largely unclear. In this study, ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-based metabolomic analysis was employed to identify metabolites in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and to assess the metabolic alterations caused by PFOA exposure. Our comparative metabolomic analysis results demonstrated that PFOA treatment could increase the level of organic acids and reduce the level of lipid molecules. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation further highlighted the fact that the PFOA treatment interfered with the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids, which may lead to disruption of the immune system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Lymphocytes; Metabolism; Metabolomics; Perfluorooctanoic acid,"Liquid chromatography; Lymphocytes; Metabolism; Metabolites; Organic pollutants; Human lymphocytes; Human peripheral blood; Metabolomic analysis; Metabolomics; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Toxicological effects; Ultra performance liquid chromatography; Blood; alanine aminotransferase; albumin; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; bilirubin glucuronide; carboxylic acid derivative; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; nucleoside derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; amino acid; fluorocarbon; lipid; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; amino acid; blood; genetic analysis; lipid; liquid chromatography; metabolism; metabolite; organic acid; persistent organic pollutant; toxicology; adult; amino acid metabolism; Article; biochemical analysis; bioinformatics; carbohydrate metabolism; clinical article; female; human; human cell; immune system; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; immunophenotyping; ionization; lipid metabolism; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; metabolomics; peripheral lymphocyte; persistent organic pollutant; pH; pollutant; retention time; staining; toxicology; ultra performance liquid chromatography; young adult; blood cell; cell culture; drug effect; high performance liquid chromatography; lymphocyte; metabolism; metabolomics; pharmacology; procedures; toxicity; Amino Acids; Blood Cells; Caprylates; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Cells, Cultured; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Lymphocytes; Metabolomics",Elsevier Ltd
Insights into the isotherm and kinetic models for the coadsorption of pharmaceuticals in the absence and presence of metal ions: A review,"Ahmed M.J., Hameed B.H.",2019,Journal of Environmental Management,"Pharmaceuticals are a wide class of emerging pollutants due to their continuous and the increasing consumption of users. These pollutants are usually found in the real environment as mixtures alone or with metal ions. Thus, the migration risk increases, which complicates the removal of pharmaceuticals because of the combined and synergistic effects. The focus of treatment of pharmaceutical mixtures and their coexistence with metals is of considerable importance. For this purpose, adsorption has been efficiently applied to several studies for the treatment of such complex systems. In this article, the coadsorption behavior of pharmaceuticals in the absence and existence of metals on several adsorbents has been reviewed. The adsorption isotherms and kinetics of these two systems have been analyzed using different models and discussed. Important challenges and promising routes are suggested for the future development of the coadsorption of the studied systems. This article provides an overview on the most utilized and effective adsorbents, widely studied adsorbates, best applied isotherm and kinetic models, and competitive effect in coadsorption of pharmaceuticals, both with and without metals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Coadsorption; Emerging pollutant; Metal ion; Modeling; Pharmaceuticals,"activated carbon; adsorbent; atenolol; atorvastatin; biochar; carbon; chitosan; ciprofloxacin; diazepam; diclofenac; estradiol; estriol; ethinylestradiol; gemfibrozil; graphene oxide; ibuprofen; ketoprofen; mestranol; metal ion; metoprolol; naproxen; oxytetracycline; paracetamol; penicillin G; propranolol; sulfadiazine; sulfadimidine; sulfamethoxazole; tetracycline; trimethoprim; unclassified drug; heavy metal; ion; metal; adsorption; chemical pollutant; drug; ion; isotherm; metal; model; modeling; pollutant removal; reaction kinetics; adsorption; adsorption kinetics; analytic method; analytical error; diffusion; freundlich multi component model; intraparticle diffusion model; isotherm; langmuir multi component model; multi component isotherm model; multi component kinetic model; pollutant; pseudo first order model; pseudo second order model; rate constant; Review; kinetics; water pollutant; Adsorption; Ions; Kinetics; Metals; Metals, Heavy; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Academic Press
Efficient PFAS Removal by Amine-Functionalized Sorbents: Critical Review of the Current Literature,"Ateia M., Alsbaiee A., Karanfil T., Dichtel W.",2019,Environmental Science and Technology Letters,"Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of persistent and mobile fluoro-organic chemicals that have been detected in many water supplies, and their recommended safe concentrations in drinking water are as low as 6 ng/L. Current technological advances suggest that amine-containing sorbents can provide alternative solutions to PFAS control in the treatment of municipal water and wastewater at relatively low PFAS concentrations. The objective of this review is to provide critical analysis of the development and application of amine-containing sorbents for PFAS removal. The removal of PFAS by aminated sorbents relies on the combined effects of three main factors: (i) electrostatic interactions with functional groups of the sorbent, (ii) hydrophobic interactions with the sorbent and between PFAS molecules, and (iii) sorbent morphology. The design of next-generation sorbents should take into consideration these three factors and their relative contribution. We also provide an outlook and highlight of the key areas of innovative research needs to develop more efficient sorbents that will enable compliance with the increasingly stringent regulations of PFAS.

Research and technological advances regarding the study of the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes and antimicrobial-resistant bacteria related to animal husbandry,"Li N., Liu C., Zhang Z., Li H., Song T., Liang T., Li B., Li L., Feng S., Su Q., Ye J., Zhu C.",2019,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"The extensive use of antimicrobials in animal farms poses serious safety hazards to both the environment and public health, and this trend is likely to continue. Antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) are a class of emerging pollutants that are difficult to remove once introduced. Understanding the environmental transfer of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) and ARGs is pivotal for creating control measures. In this review, we summarize the research progress on the spread and detection of ARB and ARG pollution related to animal husbandry. Molecular methods such as high-throughput sequencing have greatly enriched the information about ARB communities. However, it remains challenging to delineate mechanisms regarding ARG induction, transmission, and tempo-spatial changes in the whole process, from animal husbandry to multiple ecosystems. As a result, future research should be more focused on the mechanisms of ARG induction, transmission, and control.

Replacement for patellofemoral arthritis,"Johnson D.S., Turner P.G.",2019,Knee,"Background: Patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) is relatively common, affecting 24% females and 11% males over the age of 55 years. Most patients can be treated conservatively. Arthroplasty remains the ultimate procedure for end stage PFOA. Debate continues as to whether total knee replacement (TKR) or patellofemoral replacement (PFR) is better for this group of patients. The aim of this article is to review the current evidence for use of these two procedures in this condition. Methods: Recent meta-analyses, systematic reviews and appropriate cohort publications concerning surgical management of PFOA were sourced. A cohort of patients from the authors' own institution was also reviewed. An instructional lecture was then created and delivered at the British Association for Surgery of the Knee 2019 annual conference, on behalf of the British Patellofemoral Society. This article has been written based on this lecture. Results: It is clear that PFOA is a different disease process than tibiofemoral osteoarthritis (TFOA). There is no doubt that PFR has a higher failure rate than TKR, but evidence suggests that outcomes and recovery may be better in the PFR group. This is complicated by subsets of those with PFOA faring better than others, the reasons for which are likely to be multifactorial. Conclusions: Both PFR and TKR may be used appropriately for PFOA. In keeping with a shared decision-making process, patients should be counselled appropriately preoperatively when deciding between these procedures. Further research is required to understand the differences in outcome between procedures and in subsets of patients with PFOA. © 2019",Arthroplasty; Osteoarthritis; Patellofemoral; Patient related outcome measures; Survivorship,"Article; clinical effectiveness; cost benefit analysis; human; knee arthritis; length of stay; meta analysis; outcome assessment; patellofemoral joint; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; survival analysis; survival time; survivorship; systematic review; total knee arthroplasty; aged; female; knee osteoarthritis; knee replacement; male; middle aged; treatment outcome; Aged; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Patellofemoral Joint; Treatment Outcome",Elsevier B.V.
"Children's environmental health based on birth cohort studies of Asia (2) – air pollution, pesticides, and heavy metals","Tsai M.-S., Chen M.-H., Lin C.-C., Liu C.-Y., Chen P.-C.",2019,Environmental Research,"The life style and child raising environment in Asia are quite different compared with Western countries. Besides, the children's environmental threats and difficulties in conducting studies could be different. To address children's environmental health in Asia area, the Birth Cohort Consortium of Asia (BiCCA) was co-established in 2011. We reviewed the mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluoroalkyl substances, phthalates, and environmental tobacco smoke in pervious based on birth cohort studies in Asia. The aim of this study was to summarize the traditional environmental pollution and the target subjects were also based on the birth cohort in Asia area. Environmental pollutants included air pollutants, pesticides focusing on organochlorine pesticides, diakylphosphates, and pyrethroid, and heavy metals including lead, arsenic, cadmium, manganese, vanadium, and thallium. Fetal growth and pregnancy outcomes, childhood growth and obesity, neurodevelopment and behavioral problems, and allergic disease and immune function were classified to elucidate the children's health effects. In total, 106 studies were selected in this study. The evidences showed air pollution or pesticides may affect growth during infancy or childhood, and associated with neurodevelopmental or behavioral problems. Prenatal exposure to lead or manganese was associated with neurodevelopmental or behavioral problems, while exposure to arsenic or cadmium may influence fetal growth. In addition to the harmonization and international collaboration of birth cohorts in Asia; however, understand the whole picture of exposure scenario and consider more discipline in the research are necessary. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Air pollution; Asia; Birth cohort; Heavy metals; Pesticides,"arsenic; cadmium; heavy metal; lead; manganese; organochlorine pesticide; pesticide; pyrethroid; thallium; vanadium; heavy metal; pesticide; atmospheric pollution; child health; cohort analysis; environmental quality; heavy metal; PCB; pesticide residue; phthalate; pollution exposure; pregnancy; smoke; tobacco; air pollutant; air pollution; allergic disease; Article; Asia; child; child growth; child health; childhood; childhood obesity; environmental exposure; environmental health; fetus growth; human; infancy; pregnancy outcome; prenatal exposure; priority journal; problem behavior; systematic review; air pollution; cohort analysis; environmental health; female; pollutant; pregnancy; Asia; Nicotiana tabacum; Air Pollution; Asia; Child; Child Health; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Pesticides; Pregnancy",Academic Press Inc.
Persistent pollutants: Focus on perfluorinated compounds and kidney,"Ferrari F., Orlando A., Ricci Z., Ronco C.",2019,Current Opinion in Critical Care,"Purpose of reviewThere is increasing interest in the environmental and human damage caused by pollutants. Big efforts are continuously made to monitor their levels and identify safe thresholds. For this purpose, an essential step is to prioritize harmful substances and understand their effect on human body. Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) deserve particular attention because of their wide diffusion and potential correlation with different diseases including glucose intolerance, hyperlipidaemia, thyroid diseases, gestational diabetes mellitus and hypertension, testicular and genitourinary cancer as well as impaired kidney function. This review focuses on the renal effects of PFCs, with the attempt to clarify their occurrence and pathogenetic mechanisms.Recent findingsWe reviewed MEDLINE and EMBASE citations between 31 October 2017 and 31 May 2019 and selected human studies measuring PFCs exposure, kidney function markers and the ability of haemodialysis to remove PFCs from the circulating blood. It has been currently clarified that exposure to PFCs is linked with an impaired kidney function and that they can be removed by blood purification.SummaryFurther studies are required on the potential synergic negative effect of PFCs co-exposure with other pollutants as well as animal studies about the removal capacity of different haemodialysis membranes.

Fragile-to-strong transitions in glass forming liquids,Lucas P.,2019,Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids: X,"Since they were first reported almost two decades ago, fragile-to-strong (FTS) transitions have been observed in all categories of glass-forming systems including metallic, covalent, ionic and molecular liquids. In these systems, a transition from Arrhenius to non-Arrhenius viscosity behavior is observed in conjunction with anomalies in multiple thermodynamic variables including the heat capacity, the thermal expansion coefficient and the isothermal compressibility. A review of experimental evidences supporting the existence of FTS transitions is presented. In particular FTS transitions are found to be concomitant with a peak in heat-capacity as well as density extrema associated with a negative expansion coefficient in the region of the transition. Moreover, spectroscopic analyses also show distinct structural changes across these liquid-liquid transitions. Reports of FTS transitions in each category of liquid are reviewed. © 2019 The Author(s)",Entropy; Fragility; Polyamorphism; Viscosity,Entropy; Expansion; Glass; Glass forming machines; Specific heat; Spectroscopic analysis; Thermal expansion; Viscosity; Expansion coefficients; Experimental evidence; Fragility; Isothermal compressibility; Liquid-liquid transition; Polyamorphism; Thermal expansion coefficients; Thermodynamic variables; Liquids,Elsevier B.V.
An Efficient New Process for the Selective Production of Odd-Chain Carboxylic Acids by Simple Carbon Elongation Using Megasphaera hexanoica,"Kim H., Jeon B.S., Sang B.-I.",2019,Scientific Reports,"The caproate-producing bacterium, Megasphaera hexanoica, metabolizes fructose to produce C2~C8 carbon-chain carboxylic acids using various electron acceptors. In particular, odd-chain carboxylic acids (OCCAs) such as valerate (C5) and heptanoate (C7), were produced at relatively high concentrations upon propionate supplementation. Using a statistical experimental design method, the optimal culture medium was established for the selective production of OCCAs among the total produced acids. In a medium containing 2.42 g L−1 sodium acetate and 18.91 g L−1 sodium propionate, M. hexanoica produced 9.48 g L−1 valerate, 2.48 g L−1 heptanoate, and 0.12 g L−1 caproate. To clarify the metabolism of the exogenous added propionate for OCCAs production, 13C tracer experiments were performed by supplementing the culture broth with [1,2,3-13C3] propionate. The metabolites analysis based on mass spectrometry showed that the propionate was only used to produce valerate and heptanoate without being participated in other metabolic pathways. Furthermore, the carbon elongation pathway in M. hexanoica was explained by the finding that the incorporation of propionate and acetate in the produced valerate occurred in only one orientation. © 2019, The Author(s).",,carbon; carboxylic acid; chemical engineering; fermentation; mass spectrometry; Megasphaera; metabolism; Carbon; Carboxylic Acids; Chemical Engineering; Fermentation; Mass Spectrometry; Megasphaera; Metabolic Networks and Pathways,Nature Publishing Group
Adsorption of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) from aqueous solution - A review,"Zhang D.Q., Zhang W.L., Liang Y.N.",2019,Science of the Total Environment,"Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have gained increasingly global attention in recent years. Due to their unique amphiphilic properties and stability, PFASs are recognized as highly persistent, toxic, and environmentally bioaccumulative. Among several physicochemical technologies, adsorption has been extensively used and proved to be an effective method for removing PFASs from aqueous environment. In this review article, the technical feasibility of the use of different adsorbents, such as activated carbon, ion exchange resins, minerals, molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and a wide range of potentially low-cost biosorbents, for PFASs removal from water or wastewater is critically reviewed. The evaluation and comparison of their PFASs sorption behavior in terms of kinetics and isotherms is presented. The mechanisms involved in PFASs adsorption processes, such as diffusion, electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interaction, ion exchange and hydrogen bond, are discussed. The effects of the parameters variability on sorption process are highlighted. Based on the literature reviewed, a few recommendations for future research on PFASs adsorption are also elaborated.

Prevalence of symptomatic pelvic floor disorders in community-dwelling women in low and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Islam R.M., Oldroyd J., Rana J., Romero L., Karim M.N.",2019,International Urogynecology Journal,"Introduction and hypothesis: Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), including urinary incontinence (UI), faecal incontinence (FI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP), are common debilitating conditions globally, with considerable variation of prevalence reported in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). It was hypothesised that the variation could be due to both random and non-random errors. The aim was to determine the pooled prevalence estimates of PFDs among community-dwelling women in LMICs and to examine possible reasons for the variations of prevalence reported. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Maternity & Infant Care was conducted to retrieve eligible studies. A meta-analysis with a random effects model and a meta-regression were performed. The manuscript was structured using the PRISMA checklist. Results: A total of 49 studies were included. The overall pooled prevalence of PFDs in LMICs was 25% (95% CI 22–29%). The pooled prevalence of UI, FI and POP was 30% (95% CI 25–35%), 8% (95% CI 4–11%) and 15% (95% CI 10–20%), respectively. A significant difference in the prevalence of UI was found between studies conducted in low and lower middle-income and upper middle-income countries and for FI between studies that used validated and non-validated questionnaires. Other methodological features did not show any effect on the variation of prevalence estimates of UI, FI and POP. Conclusions: PFDs affect a substantial proportion of women in LMICs. Since methodological heterogeneity was unexplained, this review suggests the need for large nationally representative population-based surveys to provide reliable estimates of the prevalence of PFDs in LMICs. © 2019, The International Urogynecological Association.",Faecal incontinence; Low and middle-income countries; Pelvic floor disorders; Pelvic organ prolapse; Urinary incontinence,clinical feature; community dwelling person; feces incontinence; female; human; low income country; middle income country; pelvic floor disorder; pelvic organ prolapse; priority journal; questionnaire; Review; systematic review; urine incontinence,Springer London
An overview of omics approaches to characterize the effect of perfluoroalkyl substances in environmental health,"Yao X., Cao D., Wang F., Zhang W., Ma C., Song M.",2019,TrAC - Trends in Analytical Chemistry,"The production and widespread use of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) has led to their presence in the environment, wildlife, and the human body. PFAS exposure has been indicated that could adversely affect human health. PFASs trigger chemical signals to cells, which further emit new signals to tissues and even to organs, and finally cause diseases. Detection of these signals and understanding of the meaning behind them are great challenges, which may be tackled through high-throughput ‘omics’ technologies, including transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. This review summarizes the analytical methodologies, such as sequencing, microarray, mass spectrometry (MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), used in these ‘omics’ technologies and therefore applied in the bioanalysis of PFAS-related health risks. We provide a summary of the important roles that analytic methodologies have played in the study of human health.

A critical review on passive sampling in air and water for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs),"Lai F.Y., Rauert C., Gobelius L., Ahrens L.",2019,TrAC - Trends in Analytical Chemistry,"Passive sampling methods have been widely used for monitoring pollutants in different environments due to their advantages including simplicity to use and time-integrated sampling. Despite the advantages, challenges still exist and are associated with the calibration and implementation of passive sampling, in particular for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) due to their unique physicochemical properties. In the current review, we focus on the calibration and use of passive samplers for PFASs in air and water. The comparison of the sampling rates generally showed a higher variability for the aqueous passive samplers compared to the passive air samplers. A better standardization for calibration methods for PFASs in air and water is needed. Nevertheless, passive samplers are an ideal tool for monitoring PFASs in air and water and can identify spatial or temporal trends and pollution sources, variations in water quality and ultimately improve our understanding of the global distribution of PFASs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Application; Calibration; Environmental monitoring; Passive sampler; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Sampling rate; Spatial and temporal trends,Applications; Calibration; Pollution detection; Water quality; Environmental Monitoring; Passive samplers; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Sampling rates; Spatial and temporal trends; Water pollution; chemical compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution; air sampling; calibration; comparative study; controlled study; environmental monitoring; priority journal; Review; sampling; standardization; water pollutant; water pollution; water quality; water sampling,Elsevier B.V.
Analytical methodologies for the determination of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in sewage sludge: A critical review,"Pérez-Lemus N., López-Serna R., Pérez-Elvira S.I., Barrado E.",2019,Analytica Chimica Acta,"Several analytical approaches have been developed for the determination of emerging pollutants (EPs), including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in environmental matrices. This paper reviews the sample preparation and instrumental methods proposed in the last few years (2012–2018) to assess PPCPs in sewage sludge. Three main steps are examined: extraction, clean-up and analysis. Sample preparation is critical as target compounds are normally found at low concentrations in complex matrices. Most procedures include sewage sludge pretreatment mostly through ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) although other novel techniques such as QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) or MSPD (matrix solid-phase dispersion) have been also employed. In one report, no differences in extraction efficiency were detected among the most commonly used extraction techniques such as ultrasound, microwave and pressurized liquid. Clean-up usually involves a conventional method such as solid phase extraction (SPE). This step is needed to appreciably reduce matrix suppression, and is followed by an instrumental analysis using techniques of preference such as gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC), mostly coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). A fully automated on-line system that includes extraction, chromatographic separation, and mass spectrometry in one-stage is here presented as a novel way of determining PPCPs in sewage sludge. This review also discusses the advantages and limitations of the different techniques used. Miniaturizing analytical techniques and the use of novel solid and liquid phase materials are emerging as efficient options that fulfill the principles of so-called ""green chemistry"". © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Gas chromatography; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; PPCPs; Sample pretreatment; Sewage sludge,"Gas chromatography; Liquid chromatography; Liquids; Mass spectrometry; Matrix solid phase dispersion; Phase separation; Sewage sludge; Ultrasonics; Analytical methodology; Chromatographic separations; Extraction efficiencies; Pharmaceuticals and personal care products; PPCPs; Sample pretreatment; Solid-phase extraction; Ultrasound-assisted extraction; Extraction; analytic method; gas chromatography; green chemistry; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; microwave radiation; review; sewage; solid phase extraction; ultrasound assisted extraction; chemical analysis; fractionation; procedures; sewage; water pollutant; cosmetic; drug; Chemical Fractionation; Chemistry Techniques, Analytical; Cosmetics; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Sewage; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier B.V.
Persistence and impact of steroidal estrogens on the environment and their laccase-assisted removal,"Bilal M., Iqbal H.M.N.",2019,Science of the Total Environment,"Steroidal estrogens are widespread water contaminants with potential carcinogenic and endocrine-disrupting activities. The World Health Organization has listed estrogens as group 1 carcinogens. These contaminants are of substantial concern because of potential threats to human health, and aquatic organisms on long-term exposure. A range of methods, including oxidation, adsorption, electrochemical, and irradiation techniques have been employed for their remediation from aqueous systems. However, inadequate removal, toxic sludge generation, high operating costs, and the requisite for skilled operating and maintenance personnel commercially hampered the application of many methods. An interesting alternative treatment approach based on the use of oxidoreductases, particularly laccases, has recently gained amicability for the biotransformation of emerging pollutants. The use of immobilized enzymes is more cost-effective from an industrial perspective due to improved catalytic stability, reusability, reduction of product inhibition, and easier product separation. This review provides comprehensive knowledge on the use of laccases in the biodegradation of steroidal estrogens, including estrone, 17β-estradiol, and 17α-ethinylestradiol with endocrine-disrupting potency from the environment. After an overview of estrogens and catalytic properties of laccase, the use of free, as well as immobilized laccases with a particular emphasis on estrogens removal by laccase-based fed-batch, packed bed bioreactors, and membrane reactors, is discussed. A comparison of existing treatment technologies with enzyme technology for the removal of estrogens from different environmental matrices is made. Lastly, along with concluding remarks, future research direction aimed at bridging knowledge gaps for estrogenic compounds removal are also proposed in this very important research area. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Biodegradation; Environmental impact; Enzymatic membrane reactor; Fed-batch bioreactor; Laccase; Steroidal estrogens,"Aquatic organisms; Batch reactors; Biodegradation; Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Endocrine disrupters; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Enzyme inhibition; Health risks; Operating costs; Packed beds; Reusability; Endocrine disrupting activity; Environmental matrixes; Enzymatic membrane reactors; Fed-batch bioreactors; Future research directions; Laccases; Steroidal estrogens; World Health Organization; Water pollution; estradiol; estrogen; estrone; ethinylestradiol; laccase; endocrine disruptor; estrogen; immobilized enzyme; laccase; biodegradation; bioreactor; endocrine disruptor; environmental impact; enzyme activity; estrogenic compound; membrane; persistence; steroid; water treatment; biodegradation; catalysis; concentration (parameter); environmental impact; enzyme activity; immobilization; ozonation; priority journal; Review; waste component removal; waste water management; bioremediation; biotransformation; metabolism; water pollutant; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biotransformation; Endocrine Disruptors; Enzymes, Immobilized; Estrogens; Laccase; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier B.V.
"In-utero stress and mode of conception: Impact on regulation of imprinted genes, fetal development and future health","Argyraki M., Damdimopoulou P., Chatzimeletiou K., Grimbizis G.F., Tarlatzis B.C., Syrrou M., Lambropoulos A.",2019,Human Reproduction Update,"BACKGROUND: Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic gene regulatory mechanism; disruption of this process during early embryonic development can have major consequences on both fetal and placental development. The periconceptional period and intrauterine life are crucial for determining long-term susceptibility to diseases. Treatments and procedures in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and adverse in-utero environments may modify the methylation levels of genomic imprinting regions, including insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)/H19, mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST), and paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10), affecting the development of the fetus. ART, maternal psychological stress, and gestational exposures to chemicals are common stressors suspected to alter global epigenetic patterns including imprinted genes. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Our objective is to highlight the effect of conception mode and maternal psychological stress on fetal development. Specifically, we monitor fetal programming, regulation of imprinted genes, fetal growth, and long-term disease risk, using the imprinted genes IGF2/H19, MEST, and PEG10 as examples. The possible role of environmental chemicals in genomic imprinting is also discussed. SEARCH METHODS: A PubMed search of articles published mostly from 2005 to 2019 was conducted using search terms IGF2/H19, MEST, PEG10, imprinted genes, DNA methylation, gene expression, and imprinting disorders (IDs). Studies focusing on maternal prenatal stress, psychological well-being, environmental chemicals, ART, and placental/fetal development were evaluated and included in this review. OUTCOMES: IGF2/H19, MEST, and PEG10 imprinted genes have a broad developmental effect on fetal growth and birth weight variation. Their disruption is linked to pregnancy complications, metabolic disorders, cognitive impairment, and cancer. Adverse early environment has a major impact on the developing fetus, affecting mostly growth, the structure, and subsequent function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and neurodevelopment. Extensive evidence suggests that the gestational environment has an impact on epigenetic patterns including imprinting, which can lead to adverse long-term outcomes in the offspring. Environmental stressors such as maternal prenatal psychological stress have been found to associate with altered DNA methylation patterns in placenta and to affect fetal development. Studies conducted during the past decades have suggested that ART pregnancies are at a higher risk for a number of complications such as birth defects and IDs. ART procedures involve multiple steps that are conducted during critical windows for imprinting establishment and maintenance, necessitating long-term evaluation of children conceived through ART. Exposure to environmental chemicals can affect placental imprinting and fetal growth both in humans and in experimental animals. Therefore, their role in imprinting should be better elucidated, considering the ubiquitous exposure to these chemicals. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Dysregulation of imprinted genes is a plausible mechanism linking stressors such as maternal psychological stress, conception using ART, and chemical exposures with fetal growth. It is expected that a greater understanding of the role of imprinted genes and their regulation in fetal development will provide insights for clinical prevention and management of growth and IDs. In a broader context, evidence connecting impaired imprinted gene function to common diseases such as cancer is increasing. This implies early regulation of imprinting may enable control of long-term human health, reducing the burden of disease in the population in years to come. © 2019 The Author(s)..

Spatial and temporal variability of perfluoroalkyl substances in the Laurentian Great Lakes,Remucal C.K.,2019,Environmental Science: Processes and Impacts,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a diverse group of fluorinated organic chemicals that have been used in industrial and consumer applications since the 1950s. PFAS are resistant to chemical and biological degradation and are ubiquitous in the environment, including in water, sediment, and biota in the Laurentian Great Lakes. This critical review evaluates the spatial and temporal variability of commonly studied perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) in the Great Lakes by synthesizing data collected in water, surface sediment, sediment cores, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and herring gull (Larus argentatus) eggs. The lowest PFAS concentrations in all matrices are detected in Lake Superior, which is located in the most pristine region of the Great Lakes Basin. In contrast, higher concentrations are observed in Lakes Erie and Ontario, which are more impacted by industrial activity and wastewater discharge. The distribution of individual PFAS compounds also varies across the lakes in response to changes in PFAS sources, with higher proportions of PFSAs in the eastern lakes. Sediment and biota are enriched in long chain PFSAs and PFCAs relative to concentrations in the water column, as expected based on predicted partitioning behavior. Sediment cores and bioarchives consistently demonstrate that PFAS concentrations increased in the Great Lakes from the initial time points until the early 2000s. The available data indicate that PFOS and PFOA concentrations decline after this period in the upper Great Lakes, but are stable in Lake Ontario. However, these trends depend on the lake, the individual compound, and the organism considered. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carboxylation; Industrial chemicals; Organic chemicals; Sedimentation; Sediments; Chemical and biological degradation; Consumer applications; Industrial activities; Laurentian Great Lakes; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Spatial and temporal variability; Wastewater discharge; Lakes; alkyl group; carboxylic acid derivative; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl carboxylate; perfluoroalkyl sulfonate; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; water; carboxylic acid; fluorocarbon; biota; bird; concentration (parameter); fish; herring; lake; lake trout; Neovison vison; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; sediment; animal; Charadriiformes; chemistry; environmental monitoring; lake; metabolism; procedures; salmonine; spatiotemporal analysis; United States; water pollutant; Animals; Carboxylic Acids; Charadriiformes; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Geologic Sediments; Great Lakes Region; Lakes; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Trout; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Royal Society of Chemistry

In Germany it is currently being examined whether and for whom these tests should be paid for by statutory health insurance in the future. Objective: (I) Diagnostic properties of NIPTs for the detection of trisomy 13, 18 and 21, and (II) hypothetical calculation of the possible use of NIPTs in different groups. Methods: (I) Systematic search for primary literature and systematic reviews in MEDLINE and four other databases. Inclusion criteria: Studies in pregnant women; index test: NIPT using molecular genetic analysis of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood to determine the trisomy risk; reference test: cytogenetic diagnostics or postnatal clinical examination. (II) Exploratory search. Hypothetical calculations for (1) all pregnant women following the current procedure without NIPTs using the example of first-trimester screening (FTS), (2) application in pregnant women with an increased risk (e.g., after preceding FTS), and (3) application of NIPT in a population with and without an increased trisomy risk. Results: In the 22 studies included, sensitivity and specificity for trisomy 21 detection were 99.13% (95% CI: [97.39%; 99.72%]) and 99.95% (95% CI: [99.88%; 99.98%]). The possible influence of test failures was not considered in the calculations, and thus the sensitivity or specificity of NIPTs may have been overestimated. For the detection of trisomy 13 and 18, the sensitivity could not be robustly estimated. Discussion: In pregnant women with an increased risk, NIPT can probably reduce the number of invasive tests and thus the number of test-related miscarriages. © 2019, The Author(s).",Chromosome disorders; Pregnancy; Prenatal diagnosis; Systematic review; Trisomy,DNA; clinical examination; cytogenetics; diagnostic test accuracy study; genetic analysis; human; Medline; molecular diagnosis; non invasive molecular genetic prenatal test; Review; screening; sensitivity and specificity; systematic review; trisomy 13; trisomy 18; trisomy 21,Springer Medizin
"Treatment of per- And polyfluoroalkyl substances in landfill leachate: Status, chemistry and prospects","Wei Z., Xu T., Zhao D.",2019,Environmental Science: Water Research and Technology,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been widely detected in municipal landfills due to the massive uses of PFAS in everyday consumer products. PFAS in landfill leachate can contaminate the neighbouring soil and groundwater and pose serious health concerns to human and ecosystems. Yet, information is lacking on the distribution, transformation and fate of various PFAS in landfills, and on the treatment technologies to remove or degrade PFAS in landfill leachate. As the relevant regulations are rapidly evolving, the research and technology development have been gaining momentum in recent years. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the state of the science on the occurrence and treatment technologies of PFAS in landfills. Specifically, this review aims to overview the following aspects: 1) the occurrence and transformation of PFAS under typical landfill environmental conditions, 2) the chemistry and state-of-art technologies for treating PFAS in landfill leachate, including adsorption, biodegradation, photo-degradation, and membrane processes, and 3) the key knowledge gaps and future research/technology needs for controlling PFAS from landfills. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Biodegradation; Consumer products; Environmental technology; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Environmental conditions; Landfill leachates; Membrane process; Municipal landfills; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Research and Technology Development; State-of-art technology; Treatment technologies; Leachate treatment; environmental conditions; landfill; leachate; organohalogen; technological development,Royal Society of Chemistry
Seminal plasma metabolites mediate the associations of multiple environmental pollutants with semen quality in Chinese men,"Huang Q., Liu L., Wu Y., Wang X., Luo L., Nan B., Zhang J., Tian M., Shen H.",2019,Environment International,"Environmental exposure to arsenic, phthalate esters (PAEs) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) has been associated with human semen quality. However, the epidemiological “black-box” of these associations remains poorly uncovered. In this study, based on the association analysis between arsenic, PAE and PFC exposure and semen quality parameters (i.e., semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm count, progressive motility, total motility and normal morphology) in a Chinese male population, we explored the seminal plasma metabolic signatures that may mediate the exposure-outcome relations by using the meet-in-metabolite-analysis (MIMA) approach. As a result, a negative association was found between DMA and sperm concentration, whereas MEHP and PFHxS were positively associated with sperm count and concentration, respectively. Metabolomics analysis revealed that sixteen and twenty-two seminal plasma metabolites were related to sperm concentration and count, respectively, and they are mainly involved in fatty acid, lipid and amino acid metabolism. Moreover, it was further indicated that eicosatetraenoate, carnitines and DHA may impact the inverse association between DMA and sperm concentration, while eicosatetraenoate, carnitines, DHA, PGB2 and tocotrienol are possible mediators of the positive association between PFHxS and sperm concentration. As these metabolic biomarkers are relevant to antioxidation and fatty acid β-oxidation, we suggest that redox balance and energy generation shifts in seminal plasma are involved in the association of human semen quality with environmental DMA and PFHxS exposure. © 2019 The Authors",Arsenic; Human semen quality; Mode of action; Perfluorinated compounds; Phthalates; Seminal plasma metabolomics,"Arsenic; Biomolecules; Chemical resistance; Esters; Fatty acids; Metabolism; Metabolites; Mode of action; Perfluorinated compounds; Phthalates; Plasma metabolomics; Semen qualities; Quality control; alpha tocotrienol; amino acid; arsenic; cacodylic acid; carnitine; docosahexaenoic acid; fatty acid; icosatetraenoic acid; lipid; perfluoro compound; phthalic acid ester; prostaglandin B2; arsenic; fluorinated hydrocarbon; phthalic acid derivative; arsenic; male; metabolite; phthalate; plasma; pollution exposure; sperm; adult; amino acid metabolism; antioxidant activity; Article; cell structure; Chinese; controlled study; energy metabolism; environmental exposure; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; human; human cell; lipid metabolism; male; male genital tract parameters; metabolomics; oxidation reduction state; priority journal; semen analysis; semen volume; seminal plasma; sperm quality; spermatozoon count; spermatozoon density; spermatozoon motility; Asian continental ancestry group; chemistry; environmental exposure; metabolism; physiology; pollutant; sperm; spermatozoon; China; Adult; Arsenic; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Male; Phthalic Acids; Semen; Semen Analysis; Sperm Count; Sperm Motility; Spermatozoa",Elsevier Ltd
"Perfluoro-3-ethyl-2,4-dimethyl-3-pentyl persistent radical: A new reagent for direct, metal-free radical trifluoromethylation and polymer initiation","Mei H., Han J., White S., Butler G., Soloshonok V.A.",2019,Journal of Fluorine Chemistry,"This review comprehensively profiles perfluoro-3-ethyl-2,4-dimethyl-3-pentyl persistent radical (PPFR) as a new reagent for radical trifluoromethylation, trifluoromethylation/fluorination and polymer initiation. The PPFR is perfectly stable at ambient conditions, but at temperatures above 80 °C undergoes β-scission to generate trifluoromethyl radical. This property can be used to initiate various chain-polymerization or trifluoromethylation reactions. The unique feature of this process, distinguishing it from all other known methods for ·CF3-radical generation, is that the radical is produced under neutral, inert and additive-free conditions. Hopefully, the mild reaction conditions and commercial availability of PPFR will generate research interest for practical applications of this novel perfluorination reagent for fluorination and polymerization processes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Fluorination; Fluorine; Persistent radical; Polymer; Trifluoromethylation,,Elsevier B.V.
Synergistic Effect of Metal-Organic Framework/Gallic Acid in Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry,"Wu J., Ouyang D., He Y., Su H., Yang B., Li J., Sun Q., Lin Z., Cai Z.",2019,ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,"Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has become an indispensable tool for high-throughput analysis of macromolecules, but many challenges still remain in detection of small molecules due to the severe matrix-related background interference in the low-molecular-weight ranges (MW < 700 Da). Herein, a gallic acid (GA)-functionalized zirconium 1,4-dicarboxybenzene metal-organic framework (MOF) (denoted as UiO-66-GA) was designed to serve as a new substrate, and a novel strategy on the basis of the synergistic effect of MOF and GA was developed to enhance the LDI process. In comparison with conventional organic matrices, the UiO-66-GA substrate showed superior LDI performance in the analysis of a wide variety of molecules including amino acids, unsaturated fatty acids, bisphenols (BPs), oligosaccharides, peptides, protein, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) of various average molecular weights from 200 to 10000. Perfluorooctanoic sulfonate (PFOS) was used to evaluate the ability of quantitative analysis, and its corresponding limit of detection as low as 1 fmol was achieved. High sensitivity and good salt tolerance of the UiO-66-GA-assisted LDI-MS were allowed to determine ultratrace PFOS in the spiked human urine and serum samples. In addition, the synergistic mechanism of MOF and GA in the enhanced LDI process was investigated by comprehensively comparing GA-and its analogue-functionalized UiO-66, and the results revealed that two aspects contributed to the enhanced LDI process: (1) an enhancement in the metal-phenolic coordination system of UiO-66-GA promoted laser absorption and energy transfer; (2) introduction of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of GA onto UiO-66 facilitated the LDI process in both positive and negative ion modes. This work expands a new domain for the MOF applications and provides a promising alternative for various molecule analyses.

Lett. 512 (2019) 134–146](S0012821X19300913)(10.1016/j.epsl.2019.02.001),"Xie R.C., Rehkämper M., Grasse P., van de Flierdt T., Frank M., Xue Z.",2019,Earth and Planetary Science Letters,"The authors regret an error in the published paper regarding the sampling procedure. The second paragraph of section 2.1 should read: “All samples were collected directly from Niskin bottles into 10 L polyethylene cubitainers. Samples were then filtered within 2 hours through 0.45 μm Millipore nitrocellulose acetate filters into acid-cleaned polyethylene cubitainers/bottles and acidified to pH ∼2 using distilled 12 M HCl in a general laboratory on board. All sample bottles were double-bagged and shipped to the home laboratory.” A number of observations demonstrate that our published Cd concentrations and isotope compositions, as well as the related discussion and interpretation, are not significantly affected by Cd contamination from the vessel, the sampling system or the initial sample handling. Firstly, the Cd concentration and isotope data for two profiles of our study show excellent agreement with results obtained for profiles from nearby stations of the GEOTRACES P16 section, which were collected with Teflon lined GO-FLO bottles and a trace metal clean sampling system (see detailed discussion in the last paragraph of section 3.2 in the original article). The most significant differences between the datasets are observed for shallow depths. In this case, however, our samples show lower Cd concentrations than samples from the nearby GEOTRACES P16 stations (Figure S2 in the original article). Secondly, Cd concentrations at St. 93 of cruise M77/4 in this study show good agreement between samples collected with Niskin bottles and those collected with GO-FLO bottles (unpublished data of Peter Croot and Kathrin Wuttig) deployed on a Kevlar line from the side of the ship (Wuttig et al., 2013) (Fig. 1). The collection and analysis procedures for these GO-FLO samples provided by Peter Croot and Kathrin Wuttig are briefly described here. Upon recovery, Teflon coated GO-FLO bottles (General Oceanics) with Teflon stop cocks were immediately brought into an over-pressurized ISO class 5 clean container. Seawater samples were filtered in-line through 0.2 μm filter cartridges (Sartorious Sartobran) under slight N2 overpressure into acid cleaned 1 L LDPE bottles (Nalgene) and acidified with sub-boiled quartz-distilled hydrochloric acid to pH 1.7. Cadmium concentrations of the GO-FLO samples were analyzed in a trace-metal clean laboratory at GEOMAR by graphite furnace atomic absorption (ETAAS, Perkin-Elmer Model 4100ZL) after Klinkhammer (1980). The handling of the samples collected with Niskin and GO-FLO samples on board therefore differed significantly, which includes using different rosette systems that were deployed at different times, the types and pore sizes of filters used for filtration and the bottles into which samples were filtered. Yet Cd concentrations agree well, particularly at shallow depths where Cd concentrations are at pmol/kg levels. A difference of ∼0.1 nmol/kg is observed between the two datasets at 200 m water depth, whereby the sample collected with the Niskin bottle shows a higher Cd concentration. This difference in Cd concentrations is within the natural variability of the Peruvian upwelling system and is also present between our Niskin bottle dataset and that of the nearby stations from the GEOTRACES P16 transect (Niskin samples in this case showing lower Cd concentrations; Figure S2 in the original article). This essentially excludes any significant artifacts originating from contamination of our samples. The authors apologize for any inconvenience caused. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,,Elsevier B.V.
Regulation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) in drinking water: A comprehensive review,Pontius F.,2019,Water (Switzerland),"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) are receiving global attention due to their persistence in the environment through wastewater effluent discharges and past improper industrial waste disposal. They are resistant to biological degradation and if present in wastewater are discharged into the environment. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) issued drinking water Health Advisories for PFOA and PFOS at 70 ng/L each and for the sum of the two. The need for an enforceable primary drinking water regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) is currently being assessed. The USEPA faces stringent legal constraints and technical barriers to develop a primary drinking water regulation for PFOA and PFOS.

Occurrence and distribution of organic and inorganic pollutants in groundwater,Kurwadkar S.,2019,Water Environment Research,"Depletion of groundwater resources and continued decline in overall groundwater quality is a cause of concern because large human population around the world uses groundwater as a source of drinking water. This paper presents a comprehensive review of studies published in the year 2018 that documented issues of groundwater pollution, sources, and distribution reported from across the world due to anthropogenic, hydroclimatogical, and natural processes. Groundwater pollution due to organic contaminants focuses particularly on pesticides, herbicides, and contaminants of emerging concern. Pollution due to inorganic pollutants such as arsenic and other heavy metals is also reviewed with particular emphasis on regions that have reported a significantly higher incidence of these pollutants in groundwater. A compilation of various studies is also included in the review paper that showed increased incidences of waterborne illnesses due to fecal and microbial contamination due to poor sanitary practices. Reviews of groundwater contaminants such as fluoride and nitrate are included to provide readers a holistic understanding of groundwater pollution problem around the world. Practitioner points: Groundwater pollution issues during 2018 are reviewed and documented. Occurrence of organic and inorganic pollutants in groundwater is reported. Groundwater pollution vulnerability remains a critical issue. © 2019 Water Environment Federation",arsenic; chromium; fluoride; heavy metals; herbicides; microbial pollution; nitrogen; perfluorinated compounds; pesticides; Pharmaceuticals,"Arsenic; Chromium; Chromium compounds; Contamination; Drug products; Fluorine compounds; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Heavy metals; Herbicides; Nitrogen; Organic pollutants; Pesticides; Population statistics; Potable water; Water quality; Weed control; Contaminants of emerging concerns; fluoride; Groundwater contaminants; Groundwater pollution vulnerabilities; Microbial contamination; Microbial pollution; Occurrence and distribution; Perfluorinated compounds; Groundwater pollution; arsenic; drug; fluoride; ground water; heavy metal; herbicide; nitrogen; perfluoro compound; pesticide; pesticide; arsenic; chromium; drug; fluoride; groundwater pollution; groundwater resource; heavy metal; herbicide; inorganic compound; organic pollutant; water quality; waterborne disease; arsenic poisoning; drug contamination; drug toxicity; ecotoxicity; ecotoxicology; feces; fluorosis; heavy metal poisoning; human; inorganic pollutant; microbial contamination; nonhuman; organic pollutant; pollutant; priority journal; Review; risk; water contamination; water pollutant; environmental monitoring; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Groundwater; Humans; Pesticides; Water Pollutants, Chemical",John Wiley and Sons Inc.
On the role of review papers in the face of escalating publication rates - a case study of research on contaminants of emerging concern (CECs),"Oberg G., Leopold A.",2019,Environment International,"In the past few decades, there has been a dramatic increase in scientific publications dealing with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and the escalating publication rate makes it close to impossible for individual researchers to get an overview of the field. Assuring the relevance and quality of the research conducted in any research field is a crucially important task. The rapidly increasing publication rates imply that review papers will play a progressively more central role to that end. The aim of the present paper is to critically assess whether reviews dealing with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are effective vehicles for a healthy dialogue about methodological weaknesses, uncertainties, research gaps and the future direction of the field. We carried out a tiered content-analysis of CEC review papers. Relevant papers were identified through searches in Web of Science (Clarivate), leading to the identification of 6391 original research papers of which 193 are review papers. We find that the majority of CEC reviews are written as if they are comprehensive, even though this clearly is not the case. A minority (~20%) take a critical-analytical approach to the reviewing task and identify weaknesses and research gaps. The following widespread tendencies in CEC research papers are commonly noted as concerning: to equate removal of CECs to ‘decreased concentrations in the effluent’; to focus on parent substances and not concern oneself with degradation products; to focus on most commonly studied substances rather than those of most concern; to not deal with the corollary of our inability to detect or assess the risk for all substances, and to give insufficient attention to uncertainties and the unknown. Several critical-analytical reviews are among the highest cited, which suggests that they have the potential to function as effective vehicles for a healthy dialogue on these topics. On the other hand, it would appear that the concerns expressed in these reviews have a limited impact, as the same concerns are repeated over time. This might be due to a tendency among review authors to express their concerns implicitly, instead of clearly spelling them out. Our study suggests that CEC reviews presently fail to provide adequate and reliable guidance regarding the relevance and quality of research in the field. We argue that the overwhelming number of publications in combination with a lack of quality criteria for review papers are reasons to this failure: it is well documented that choices made during the reviewing process have a major impact on the outcome of a review. These choices include: search engine; the criteria used to include or exclude papers; the criteria used to assess the quality of the data generated in the research papers included; the criteria used for the choice of substances/ organisms/ technologies reported on. The lack of transparent procedures makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to assess the quality of the findings presented or to put those findings in context. In this light, it is noteworthy that criteria for a good review paper are rarely spelled out by peer-reviewed journals or included in instructions on scientific writing. The dramatic increase in publications is a challenge for the entire research community, particularly for research fields that are expected to provide policy-relevant data. We argue that only when peer-reviewed journals start specifying quality criteria for review papers, can such papers be relied upon to provide adequate and strategic guidance on the development of CEC research. We anticipate that our findings and conclusions are valid for many other research fields. © 2019 The Authors",CECs; Contaminants of emerging concern; Critical analysis; ECs; Emerging contaminants; Emerging pollutants; Emerging substances of concern; ESOCs; Quality assessment; Research quality; Review papers,Contamination; Degradation; Effluents; Paper; Quality control; Risk assessment; Search engines; Uncertainty analysis; CECs; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Critical analysis; Emerging contaminant; Emerging pollutants; Emerging substances; ESOCs; Quality assessment; Research quality; Review papers; Publishing; critical analysis; data quality; literature review; pollutant; research; attention; content analysis; effluent; human; human experiment; publication; quality control; review; risk assessment; search engine; spelling; systematic review; uncertainty; Web of Science; writing; literature; medical research; pollutant; publishing; Biomedical Research; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Publishing; Review Literature as Topic,Elsevier Ltd
Persistent organic pollutants in typical lake ecosystems,"Li C., Yang L., Shi M., Liu G.",2019,Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are highly toxic organic chemicals. Lakes are one of the main sinks of POPs. POPs can be accumulated in multiple matrices in lake ecosystems and biomagnified through the food web, and thus pose a potential threat not only to lake ecosystems, but also to human health. Given their potential persistent risks, they have received much attention over the past decades. This review comprehensively summarizes the data on the levels and distributions of POPs in selected typical lake ecosystems in China and worldwide, involving water, sediments, organisms, and surrounding soils and atmosphere. It was found that current publications on POPs in Chinese lakes are mainly related to lakes in the developed eastern plain area, with only a few studies concerning the less-developed Qinghai-Tibet Plateau area. Similarly, around the world, there are more research on POPs in developed countries and less in relatively less-developed areas. Moreover, there are significant differences in the levels of POPs in different matrices in different lake ecosystems. Legacy POPs, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), were commonly detected and reported in different lakes, while emerging POPs like perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), and hexabromocyclododecane (HCBD) were relatively less detected or reported. A comprehensive summarization on the levels and distributions of traditional and emerging POPs in lake ecosystems could be significant for further understanding the behaviors and risks of POPs in lake ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Brominated flame retardants; Lake; Persistent organic pollutants; Polychlorinated naphthalenes; Water,"dibenzofuran; hexabromocyclododecane; organochlorine pesticide; perfluoro compound; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated naphthalene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; tetrabromobisphenol A; water; halogenated hydrocarbon; organic compound; bioaccumulation; flame retardant; food web; lake ecosystem; PCN; persistent organic pollutant; risk assessment; toxic substance; Article; atmosphere; China; lake ecosystem; nonhuman; North America; organisms; persistent organic pollutant; sediment; soil; analysis; chemistry; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; food chain; human; lake; statistics and numerical data; water pollutant; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Food Chain; Geologic Sediments; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Halogenated; Lakes; Organic Chemicals; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Academic Press
New Ratios for Performance Improvement for Identifying Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiencies in Expanded Newborn Screening: A Retrospective Study,"Wang B., Zhang Q., Gao A., Wang Q., Ma J., Li H., Wang T.",2019,Frontiers in Genetics,"Some success in identifying acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD) deficiencies before they are symptomatic has been achieved through tandem mass spectrometry. However, there has been several challenges that need to be confronted, including excess false positives, the occasional false negatives and indicators selection. To select ideal indicators and evaluate their performance for identifying ACAD deficiencies, data from 352,119 newborn babies, containing 20 cases, were used in this retrospective study. A total of three new ratios, C4/C5DC+C6-OH, C8/C14:1, and C14:1/C16-OH, were selected from 43 metabolites. Around 903 ratios derived from pairwise combinations of all metabolites via multivariate logistic regression analysis were used. In the current study, the regression analysis was performed to identify short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency, and very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency. In both model-building and testing data, the C4/C5DC+C6-OH, C8/C14:1 and C14:1/C16-OH were found to be better indicators for SCAD, MCAD and VLCAD deficiencies, respectively, compared to [C4, (C4, C4/C2)], [C8, (C6, C8, C8/C2, C4DC+C5-OH/C8:1)], and [C14:1, (C14:1, C14:1/C16, C14:1/C2)], respectively. In addition, 22 mutations, including 5 novel mutations and 17 reported mutations, in ACADS, ACADM, and ACADL genes were detected in 20 infants with ACAD deficiency by using high-thorough sequencing based on target capture. The pathogenic mutations of c.1031A > G in ACADS, c.449_452delCTGA in ACADM and c.1349G > A in ACADL were found to be hot spots in Suzhou patients with SCAD, MCAD, and VLCAD, respectively. In conclusion, we had identified three new ratios that could improve the performance for ACAD deficiencies compared to the used indicators. We considered to utilize C4/C5DC+C6-OH, C8/C14:1, and C14:1/C16-OH as primary indicators for SCAD, MCAD, and VLCAD deficiency, respectively, in further expanded newborn screening practice. In addition, the spectrum of mutations in Suzhou population enriches genetic data of Chinese patients with one of ACAD deficiencies. © Copyright © 2019 Wang, Zhang, Gao, Wang, Ma, Li and Wang.",C14:1/C16-OH; C4/C5DC+C6-OH; C8/C14:1; expanded newborn screening; medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency; short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency; very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; butyryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; long chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; medium chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency; Article; clinical article; enzyme deficiency; gene mutation; genetic analysis; high performance liquid chromatography; high throughput sequencing; human; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; medium chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency; metabolite; newborn; newborn screening; retrospective study; short chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency; very long chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency,Frontiers Media S.A.
A critical review on organic micropollutants contamination in wastewater and removal through carbon nanotubes,"Ahmad J., Naeem S., Ahmad M., Usman A.R.A., Al-Wabel M.I.",2019,Journal of Environmental Management,"The prevalence of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in various environmental compartments is posing a serious health risks to all kinds of lives on the planet. The levels of OMPs such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, antibiotics, pesticides, contraceptive medicines, and personal care products in water bodies are increasing with each passing day. It is an urgent need of time to limit the release of OMPs into the environment, and to remove the prevailing OMPs for sustainable environmental management. The majority of the conventional means of water decontamination are either inefficient or expensive. However, due to nanosize, high surface area, and hollow and layered structure, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) serve as excellent sorbents for the removal of a diverse range of OMPs. The occurrence of emerging OMPs and their detrimental effects on human and animal health are collected and discussed in this review. The characteristics and efficacy of various CNTs (pristine and modified) for the efficient removal of different OMPs, and the removal mechanisms have been reviewed and discussed. The literature demonstrated that adsorption of OMPs onto CNTs is very complicated and rely on multiple factors including the properties of adsorbent and the adsorbate as well as solution chemistry. It was found that H–bonding, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, H-π bongs, and π-π interactions were the major mechanisms responsible for the adsorption of OMPs onto various kinds of CNTs. Despite of higher affinities for OMPs, hydrophobicity and higher costs restrain the practical application of CNTs for wastewater treatment on large scale. However, continuous production may lead to the development of cost-effective, efficient and eco-friendly CTNs technology for wastewater treatments in future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Antibiotics; Emerging pollutants; Mechanism; Pesticide,"adsorbent; carbon nanotube; double walled nanotube; drinking water; endocrine disruptor; fungicide; ground water; herbicide; insecticide; multi walled nanotube; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; single walled nanotube; sorbent; surface water; surfactant; adsorption; antibiotics; carbon nanotube; chemical pollutant; hydrophobicity; organic pollutant; pesticide; pollutant removal; wastewater; wastewater treatment; adsorption; Article; binding affinity; chemical interaction; environmental management; force; health hazard; hydrogen bond; hydrophobicity; organic pollution; pore volume; surface area; waste water; waste water management; water pollutant; water management; Animalia; Adsorption; Nanotubes, Carbon; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Academic Press
PFAS health effects database: Protocol for a systematic evidence map,"Pelch K.E., Reade A., Wolffe T.A.M., Kwiatkowski C.F.",2019,Environment International,"Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) confer waterproof, greaseproof, and non-stick properties when added to consumer products. They are also used for industrial purposes including in aqueous film forming foams for firefighting. PFAS are ubiquitous in the environment, are widely detected in human biomonitoring studies, and are of growing regulatory concern across federal, state, and local governments. Regulators, scientists, and citizens need to stay informed on the growing health and toxicology literature related to PFAS. Objectives: The goal of this systematic evidence map is to identify and organize the available health and toxicology related literature on a set of 29 PFAS of emerging and growing concern. Search and study eligibility: We will search the electronic database PubMed for health or toxicological studies on 29 PFAS of emerging concern. Eligible studies must contain primary research investigating the link between one or more of the PFAS of interest and a health effect, toxicological, or biological mechanistic endpoint. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Title and abstract screening and full text review will require a single reviewer for inclusion to the next level and two independent reviewers for exclusion. Study quality will not be conducted for this evidence mapping. Study characteristics will be extracted and coded from the included studies and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer. The extracted and coded information will be visualized in a publicly available, interactive database hosted on Tableau Public. Results of the evidence mapping will be published in a narrative summary. © 2019",Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances; PFAS; Systematic evidence map; Toxicology,"Abstracting; Consumer products; Database systems; Mapping; Aqueous film forming foams; Electronic database; Human biomonitoring; Interactive database; PFAS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Synthesis method; Toxicology; Health; chemical compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; concentration (composition); database; health risk; pollution exposure; public health; surfactant; toxicology; accuracy; biological trait; chemical analysis; clinical protocol; data base; ecotoxicity; environmental health; evidence based medicine; ex vivo study; health hazard; in vivo study; priority journal; Review; systematic review; toxicity testing; animal; factual database; health status; human; Animals; Databases, Factual; Fluorocarbons; Health Status; Humans",Elsevier Ltd
A critical review of the impact of water on cobalt-based catalysts in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis,"Okoye-Chine C.G., Moyo M., Liu X., Hildebrandt D.",2019,Fuel Processing Technology,"Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) is the catalytic conversion of syngas into several products such as hydrocarbons, oxygenates and H2O. H2O is a key by-product of the FTS process and because a Co based catalyst has a low water-gas shift activity, the concentration of H2O increases with time on stream in FTS. While H2O has a positive influence on C5+ selectivity and a negative impact on CH4 selectivity, for virtually every Co based catalyst, the same cannot be said for the activity of all Co based catalysts, because H2O affects the activity of various Co based catalysts in different ways. Most authors observe a positive H2O effect for SiO2-supported Co catalysts and TiO2-supported Co catalysts; however, with γ-Al2O3-supported Co catalysts, a negative influence of H2O is widely reported. In addition, the impact of H2O on carbon nanofiber-supported Co catalysts is reported in literature to be positive. We propose that the phase of H2O in FTS and the water-affinity and/or resistance behavior of catalyst supports could influence the activity and selectivity of Co-based catalysts and that this could help in explaining the kinetic effect of H2O in FT synthesis. © 2019",Activity; Cobalt; Fischer-Tropsch; Selectivity; Water,Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Carbon nanofibers; Catalyst selectivity; Cobalt; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Nanocatalysts; Silica; Thermodynamic properties; Titanium dioxide; Water; Water gas shift; Catalytic conversion; Co-based catalysts; Cobalt-based catalysts; Critical review; Fischer Tropsch; Resistance behaviors; Time on streams; Water affinity; Catalyst supports,Elsevier B.V.

Methods: In 1230 mother–child pairs of three cohorts from the Spanish INMA-Project, we analyzed perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) in first-trimester maternal plasma (collection: 2003–2008). We measured abdominal circumference (AC), femur length (FL), biparietal diameter (BPD), and estimated fetal weight (EFW) by ultrasounds at 12, 20, and 34 gestational weeks. We conducted multivariable linear regression analyses between log2-transformed (PFASs) and SD-scores of fetal parameters in each cohort and subsequent meta-analysis. We also assessed effect modification by sex and maternal smoking. Results: PFHxS, PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA medians were: 0.58, 2.35, 6.05, and 0.65 ng/mL, respectively. There were no associations for the whole population in any trimester of pregnancy. However, we found an indication that maternal smoking modified the effect in different directions depending on the PFAS. Among smokers (31%), we found negative associations between both PFOA and PFNA and FL or EFW at week 20 (% change ranging between −6.8% and −5.7% per twofold PFAS increase) and positive associations between PFHxS or PFOS and BPD at week 34 (6.8% and 6.3%, respectively). Conclusions: Results did not suggest an overall association between prenatal PFASs and fetal growth. The results among smokers should be taken with caution and further studies are warranted to elucidate the possible role of smoking in this association. © 2019 The Authors",Fetal growth; PFASs; PFHxS; PFNA; PFOA; PFOS,"Fetal monitoring; Obstetrics; Regression analysis; Fetal growth; PFASs; PFHxS; PFNA; PFOA; PFOS; Smoke; industrial chemical; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; fluorine derivative; chemical pollutant; concentration (composition); growth response; maternal care; pregnancy; regression analysis; abdominal circumference; adult; Article; biometry; biparietal distance; blood level; cohort analysis; female; femur; fetus; fetus growth; fetus weight; first trimester pregnancy; human; male; maternal plasma; maternal smoking; priority journal; fetus development; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; Adult; Cohort Studies; Female; Fetal Development; Fetus; Fluorine Compounds; Humans; Male; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Pregnancy Trimester, First",Elsevier Ltd
"Mass Spectrometry-Based Metabolomics Reveals Occupational Exposure to Per- And Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Relates to Oxidative Stress, Fatty Acid β-Oxidation Disorder, and Kidney Injury in a Manufactory in China","Lu Y., Gao K., Li X., Tang Z., Xiang L., Zhao H., Fu J., Wang L., Zhu N., Cai Z., Liang Y., Wang Y., Jiang G.",2019,Environmental Science and Technology,"Occupational workers are usually exposed to high levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), placing them under greater health risks compared to the general population. Herein, 40 occupational workers from a factory in China and 52 control subjects from the general population were involved in an investigation on the potential health concerns of occupational exposure to PFASs by mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analysis. The PFAS levels in plasma from both groups were analyzed. Six PFAS congeners (ς6PFASs) were found to be the main components of the 13 detected PFASs, with a geometric mean of 1770 and 22.2 ng mL-1 in occupational workers and the general population, respectively. Metabolic profiles of the plasma samples were acquired using liquid chromatography coupled with orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The partial least-squares-discriminant analysis model indicated that the plasma metabolic profiles of the two groups could be clearly separated. Differential and correlation analyses were applied to discover potential biomarkers. A total of 14 potential biomarkers were identified, and they were found to be associated with oxidative stress, fatty acid β-oxidation disorder, and kidney injury. The obtained results indicated that the health effects of occupational exposure to PFASs on workers should not be ignored.

Neurodevelopmental and Metabolomic Responses from Prenatal Coexposure to Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and Methylmercury (MeHg) in Sprague-Dawley Rats,"Reardon A.J.F., Karathra J., Ribbenstedt A., Benskin J.P., Macdonald A.M., Kinniburgh D.W., Hamilton T.J., Fouad K., Martin J.W.",2019,Chemical Research in Toxicology,"Methylmercury (MeHg) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) are major contaminants of human blood that are both common in dietary fish, thereby raising questions about their combined impact on human development. Here, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats ingested a daily dose, from gestational day 1 through to weaning, of either 1 mg/kg bw PFOS (PFOS-only), 1 mg/kg MeHg (MeHg-only), a mixture of 0.1 mg/kg PFOS and 1 mg/kg MeHg (Low-Mix), or of 1 mg/kg of PFOS and 1 mg/kg MeHg (High-Mix). Newborns were monitored for physical milestones and reflexive developmental responses, and in juveniles the spontaneous activity, anxiety, memory, and cognition were assessed. Targeted metabolomics of 199 analytes was applied to sectioned brain regions of juvenile offspring. Newborns in the High-Mix group had decreased weight gain as well as delayed reflexes and innate behavioral responses compared to controls and individual chemical groups indicating a toxicological interaction on early development. In juveniles, cumulative mixture effects increased in a dose-dependent manner in tests of anxiety-like behavior. However, other developmental test results suggested antagonism, as PFOS-only and MeHg-only juveniles had increased hyperactivity and thigmotaxic behavior, respectively, but fewer effects in Low-Mix and High-Mix groups. Consistent with these behavioral observations, a pattern of antagonism was also observed in neurochemicals measured in rat cortex, as PFOS-only and MeHg-only juveniles had altered concentrations of metabolites (e.g., lipids, amino acids, and biogenic amines), while no changes were evident in the combined exposures. The cortical metabolites altered in PFOS-only and MeHg-only exposed groups are involved in inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission. These proof-of-principle findings at relatively high doses indicate the potential for toxicological interaction between PFOS and MeHg, with developmental-stage specific effects. Future mixture studies at lower doses are warranted, and prospective human birth cohorts should consider possible confounding effects from PFOS and mercury exposure on neurodevelopment.

On the relation between the Mason number and the durability of MR fluids,"Lucking Bigué J.-P., Landry-Blais A., Pin A., Pilon R., Plante J.-S., Chen X., Andrews M.",2019,Smart Materials and Structures,"The durability of magnetorheological (MR) fluid is a fundamental aspect of any MR device, as MR fluid is submitted to shear stresses that cause its degradation. While various studies have identified MR fluid degradation behaviors and proposed improvements, there exists no generalized failure theory to help understand the in-use degradation of MR fluids. In this regard, this study suggests that a relation exists between the Mason number and the maximum achievable lifetime dissipated energy (LDE) of MR fluids. To validate this hypothesis, custom (perfluoropolyether) and commercial (hydrocarbon) MR fluids are aged in various Mason number conditions using a clutch-type durability device. Experimental results show that under a critical Mason number of ∼1, LDE of the MR fluids can be related to the Mason Number using an analogy to metal fatigue failure. Above this critical Mason number, the fundamental degradation mechanism appears to change from a dominant mechanical wear of the particles (i.e. particle-limited) to another mechanism (i.e. fluid-limited) which is not yet fully understood. Since MR generally operate well below the critical Mason number of ∼1, the relation between the Mason number and the particle-limited regime durability of MR fluids can be very useful to design novel MR fluids or MR devices, as it provides a way to estimate the impact of various design strategies on the total expected life of the device. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Durability; Life dissipated energy; Magnetorheological clutch; Magnetorheological fluid; Mason number; Perfluoropolyether (PFPE),Degradation; Durability; Energy dissipation; Magnetorheological fluids; Mechanisms; Shear stress; Degradation behavior; Degradation mechanism; Design strategies; Dissipated energy; Fatigue failures; Magneto-rheological; Mason number; Perfluoropolyethers; Yield stress,Institute of Physics Publishing
"Endocrine disrupters, semen quality and anogenital distance",Jensen T.K.,2019,Current Opinion in Endocrine and Metabolic Research,"The literature on effects of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (organochlorine compounds, phthalates, perfluorinated alkylated substances [PFAS], and bisphenol A [BPA]) on anogenital distance (AGD) and semen quality will be reviewed and challenges discussed. Generally, AGD appears to be a promising, easily obtainable marker of male reproductive health. Maternal exposure to phthalates has been associated with shorter AGD in male offspring although not consistently, whereas too few studies on the effects of exposure to PFAS and BPA on AGD are found to draw firm conclusion. Meta-analyses suggest that adult phthalate exposure may affect semen quality, whereas the results for the effect of PFAS and BPA exposure on semen quality are contradictory. Interestingly, few studies suggest that maternal exposure to these chemicals may affect semen quality in the offspring. It is therefore important to conduct birth cohort studies focusing on the effect of exposures during vulnerable time windows. They should include biological material and focus on multiple exposures and have the necessary size and long-term follow-up with clinical examinations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; endocrine disruptor; organochlorine derivative; perfluoro compound; phthalic acid; anogenital distance; human; male; maternal exposure; priority journal; reproduction; reproductive health; Review; sperm quality; spermatozoon count; spermatozoon density",Elsevier Ltd
Metabolome Wide Association Study of Serum Poly and Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs) in Pregnancy and Early Postpartum,"Hu X., Li S., Cirillo P.M., Krigbaum N.Y., Tran V., Jones D.P., Cohn B.A.",2019,Reproductive Toxicology,"High-resolution metabolomics (HRM) profiling of metabolic fingerprints can improve understanding of how poly and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) induce metabolic alterations of in utero environment and impact fetal health. HRM profiling and quantification of PFASs were performed for 397 maternal perinatal serum samples collected from 1959-1967 in the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS). We used Metabolome-Wide Association Studies (MWAS) and pathway enrichment analysis for metabolic associations with PFOS, its precursor EtFOSAA, and EtFOSAA-to-PFOS ratio. Distinct metabolic profiles were found with EtFOSAA and PFOS. Urea cycle metabolites such as arginine, lysine and creatine had opposite associations with EtFOSAA (negative) and PFOS (positive); whereas, carnitine shuttle metabolites were found to be exclusively and positively associated with PFOS indicating perturbation in fatty acid metabolism. These differential metabolic associations for precursor and end-product represent an important first step in identifying how PFASs alter the in utero environment and potentially leads to disease risk. © 2019",breast cancer; CHDS; EtFOSAA; in utero; metabolomics; PFOS,2 (n ethylperfluorooctanesulfonamido)acetic acid; 2 (n methylperfluorooctanesulfonamido)acetic acid; arginine; carnitine; creatine; lysine; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorododecanoic acid; perfluoroheptanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonamide; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; Article; controlled study; fatty acid metabolism; female; human; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; major clinical study; metabolic fingerprinting; metabolite; metabolome wide association study; metabolomics; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; puerperium; quantitative analysis; urea cycle; adult; biological monitoring; blood; metabolome; pregnancy; puerperium; young adult; Adult; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Biological Monitoring; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Metabolome; Postpartum Period; Pregnancy; Young Adult,Elsevier Inc.
Bioaccumulation in the gut and liver causes gut barrier dysfunction and hepatic metabolism disorder in mice after exposure to low doses of OBS,"Wang C., Zhang Y., Deng M., Wang X., Tu W., Fu Z., Jin Y.",2019,Environment International,"The compound sodium ρ-perfluorous nonenoxybenzene sulfonate (OBS), a new kind of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl compound, is a surfactant for increasing oil production, and it has been widely detected in various organisms. Because of its wide use, OBS is detectable in the environment. However, knowledge about the biological toxicity of OBS to animals is very limited. Here, male mice were exposed to 0, 0.1, 1 or 10 μg/L of OBS for 6 weeks via drinking water. It was demonstrated that OBS was highly bioaccumulated both in the liver and gut in the mice after low doses of OBS exposure. Curiously, a low dose of OBS exposure also caused gut barrier dysfunction by decreasing mucus secretion and altering Ionic transport in the gut via the CFTR pathway. In addition, liver function was influenced by OBS at both the histopathological and physiological levels. Hepatic transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis showed a total of 1157 genes, and multiple metabolites changed significantly in the livers of mice exposed to low-dose OBS for 6 weeks. The functions of these changed genes and metabolites are tightly related to glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid transport, and β-oxidation. All these results indicate that the liver and gut are important target tissues for OBS exposure. Importantly, it is possible that high levels of bioaccumulation of OBS in the gut and liver might directly cause gut barrier dysfunction and hepatic metabolism disorder in mice. © 2019 The Authors",Gut barrier; Hepatotoxicity; Metabolism; Mice; OBS,Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Diseases; Fatty acids; Genes; Metabolism; Metabolites; Petroleum industry; Potable water; Biological toxicity; Fatty acid synthesis; Fatty acid transport; Gut barrier; Hepatotoxicity; Mice; Physiological levels; Polyfluoroalkyl compounds; Mammals; cholesterol; glucose; nonenoxybenzene sulfonate; surfactant; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; benzene; sulfone; bioaccumulation; digestive system; gene; metabolism; metabolite; pollution exposure; rodent; surfactant; toxicity; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioaccumulation; chemical analysis; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; environmental exposure; fatty acid synthesis; fatty acid transport; gene identification; glucose blood level; glycolysis; histopathology; immunohistochemistry; intestine; liver; liver disease; liver metabolism; male; mass spectrometry; membrane permeability; metabolomics; mouse; mucus secretion; nonhuman; oxidation; physiological process; priority journal; quantitative analysis; transcriptomics; triacylglycerol blood level; ultra performance liquid chromatography; animal; intestine; intestine mucosa; liver; metabolism; Animalia; Mus; Animals; Benzene; Intestinal Mucosa; Intestines; Liver; Male; Metabolomics; Mice; Sulfones,Elsevier Ltd
Interspecies differences in perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)toxicokinetics and application to health-based criteria,"Pizzurro D.M., Seeley M., Kerper L.E., Beck B.D.",2019,Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology,"Toxicokinetics are important for extrapolating health effects and effect levels observed in laboratory animals to humans for purposes of establishing health-based criteria. We conducted a comprehensive review of key absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)parameters across different mammalian species for five perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)and discussed how these data can be used to inform human health risk assessment of these substances. Our analysis revealed several notable differences among the different PFAS regarding species- and substance-specific tissue partitioning, half-life, and transfer to developing offspring via the placenta or lactation, as well as highlighted data gaps for certain substances. We incorporated these observations in an analysis of whether health-based values for specific PFAS can be applied to other PFAS of differing chain length or toxicological mode of action. Overall, our analysis provides one of the first syntheses of available empirical PFAS toxicokinetic data to facilitate interpreting human relevance of animal study findings and developing health-based criteria for PFAS from such studies. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Perfluorinated; PFAS; PFBA; PFBS; PFHxS; PFOA; PFOS; Toxicokinetics,perfluoro compound; perfluorobutane sulfonate; perfluorobutanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; absorption; biliary clearance; bioaccumulation; chemical structure; excretion; half life time; hazard assessment; health hazard; lactation; mammal; menstruation; metabolism; placenta; priority journal; renal clearance; Review; sex difference; tissue distribution; toxicokinetics; vertical transmission; volume of distribution; chemistry; classification; environmental monitoring; human; pharmacokinetics; pollutant; risk assessment; toxicity; toxicokinetics; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Risk Assessment; Toxicokinetics,Academic Press Inc.
Return to the operating room after patellofemoral arthroplasty versus total knee arthroplasty for isolated patellofemoral arthritis—a systematic review,"Woon C.Y.L., Christ A.B., Goto R., Shanaghan K., Shubin Stein B.E., Gonzalez Della Valle A.",2019,International Orthopaedics,"Purpose: Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are accepted treatments for end-stage isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). However, complications and re-operations have historically differed between the two procedures. We performed a systematic review to report on the re-operation rates between TKA and modern PFA for isolated PFOA. Methods: Systematically identified publications reporting on patients that underwent either TKA or modern PFA for isolated PFOA were reviewed. Meta-analysis software was used to screen potential articles with at least one year follow-up that detailed reasons for re-operation. Data was extracted and analyzed for all re-operations. Survival of the implant was used as the primary outcome; return to the operating room (OR) for any reason was used as a secondary outcome. Results: The weighted rate of either conversion or revision arthroplasty in the PFA group and the TKA group was 6.34 and 0.11, respectively. The weighted rate of return to the OR for bony and soft tissue procedures was 1.06 and 0.79, respectively. The weighted rate of manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA) was 0.32 and 1.23, respectively. Conclusion: Patients who undergo PFA may be more likely to return to the operating room for conversion to TKA and/or revision surgery than those who undergo TKA. © 2019, SICOT aisbl.",Isolated patellofemoral arthritis; Isolated patellofemoral replacement; Total knee replacment,"anesthesia; arthritis; arthroplasty; Cochrane Library; Embase; follow up; human; Medline; meta analysis; outcome assessment; patella dislocation; patellar ligament; patellofemoral arthritis; patellofemoral arthroplasty; priority journal; Review; revision arthroplasty; second look surgery; soft tissue; systematic review; total knee arthroplasty; traffic accident; adverse event; comparative study; knee; knee osteoarthritis; knee replacement; patellofemoral joint; procedures; reoperation; treatment outcome; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Humans; Knee Joint; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Patellofemoral Joint; Reoperation; Treatment Outcome",Springer Verlag
Patient satisfaction reporting for patellofemoral arthroplasty is significantly lacking: a systematic review,"Tishelman J.C., Kahlenberg C.A., Nwachukwu B.U., Gruskay J., Strickland S.M.",2019,Physician and Sportsmedicine,"Background: Patellofemoral Arthroplasty (PFA) has been shown to be successful in restoring knee function and quality of life in patients with the isolated patellofemoral disease. Patient satisfaction has been suggested as an indicator of the quality of elective orthopedic operations, although there remains no standardized method to collect and evaluate satisfaction. The present study offers a systematic review of the available literature concerning patient satisfaction following PFA to assess common methodologies for reporting patient satisfaction. Methods: A query of the Medline database produced 116 articles that were reviewed for inclusion in the review. The following inclusion criteria were used to identify suitable articles: English language, clinical outcomes study related to PFA, and patient-reported satisfaction as an outcome measure. Results: Seven studies met inclusion criteria and were eligible for review. The highest level of evidence was level-III. The study publication dates ranged from 2009 to 2016, with six published in 2015 & 2016. In total, 320 PFAs were performed on 267 patients. Four articles reported the proportion of included patients who had previous knee surgeries (range: 20–60%). Three studies used ordinal scales to rate patient satisfaction. Four studies (57.1%) reported the numeric proportion of patients satisfied following PFA, which ranged from 76% to 96.5%. Two studies used Visual Analog Scale methods. For these two studies, one of them reported the mean satisfaction score as 7.5/10, and the other reported a median of 90/100.

Effects of Maternal Reproductive Investment on Sex-Specific Pollutant Accumulation in Seabirds: A Meta-Analysis,"Hitchcock D.J., Andersen T., Varpe Ø., Borgå K.",2019,Environmental Science and Technology,"Avian egg production demands resources such as lipids and proteins. Relative egg size and mass varies across species, reflecting differences in maternal investment. This variability may affect the maternal transfer of anthropogenic pollutants including lipophilic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and protein-associated per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mercury (Hg). We conducted a meta-analysis on seabirds and investigated whether interspecies variation in maternal investment contributes toward skewed pollutant concentration ratios between males and females, as Cmale/Cfemale (80 studies). Overall concentrations of PCBs and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were 1.6 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, in males than females, whereas mercury was similar between sexes. Few studies compared females and eggs (n = 6), highlighting a knowledge gap. We found that an increasing maternal investment as a clutch-to-female mass ratio resulted in lower PCB concentrations in females than in males during the incubation period, but no sex-specific differences were observed for mercury and PFOS. Egg production is both a lipid dominated and protein-limited process. Females transfer lipophilic pollutants more easily to eggs, and to a higher degree with increasing maternal investment, but feeding ecology may be more important. Interspecies variation in maternal pollutant transfer may lead to negative effects scaling from an offspring to population level. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,Mercury (metal); Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Proteins; Anthropogenic pollutants; Incubation periods; Interspecies variation; Lipophilic pollutants; Pollutant concentration; Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Sex-specific differences; Investments; mercury; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; anthropogenic source; chemical compound; chemical pollutant; concentration (composition); egg production; egg size; feeding ecology; meta-analysis; PCB; pollution effect; seabird; Article; clutch size; concentration ratio; egg production; feeding ecology; incubation time; investment; meta analysis; nonhuman; progeny; seabird; sex difference; egg; female; human; male; ovum; pollutant; reproduction; Aves; Eggs; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Male; Ovum; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Reproduction,American Chemical Society
Composite membranes for high temperature PEM fuel cells and electrolysers: A critical review,"Sun X., Simonsen S.C., Norby T., Chatzitakis A.",2019,Membranes,"Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells and electrolysers offer efficient use and production of hydrogen for emission-free transport and sustainable energy systems. Perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membranes like Nafion® and Aquivion® are the state-of-the-art PEMs, but there is a need to increase the operating temperature to improve mass transport, avoid catalyst poisoning and electrode flooding, increase efficiency, and reduce the cost and complexity of the system. However, PSFAs-based membranes exhibit lower mechanical and chemical stability, as well as proton conductivity at lower relative humidities and temperatures above 80 °C. One approach to sustain performance is to introduce inorganic fillers and improve water retention due to their hydrophilicity. Alternatively, polymers where protons are not conducted as hydrated H3O+ ions through liquid-like water channels as in the PSFAs, but as free protons (H+) via Brønsted acid sites on the polymer backbone, can be developed. Polybenzimidazole (PBI) and sulfonated polyetheretherketone (SPEEK) are such materials, but need considerable acid doping. Different composites are being investigated to solve some of the accompanying problems and reach sufficient conductivities. Herein, we critically discuss a few representative investigations of composite PEMs and evaluate their significance. Moreover, we present advances in introducing electronic conductivity in the polymer binder in the catalyst layers. © 2019 by the authors.",Composite membrane; Electrolysers; Fuel cells; Inorganic fillers; Mixed proton electron conducting membranes; Negatrode; Positrode; Proton conductivity; Proton exchange membrane,Catalyst poisoning; Chemical stability; Composite membranes; Fillers; Fuel cells; Gas fuel purification; Hydrogen production; Membranes; Polyelectrolytes; Proton conductivity; Electrolysers; Electron conducting; Inorganic fillers; Negatrode; Positrode; Proton exchange membranes; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC),MDPI AG
Artificial oxygen carriers and red blood cell substitutes: A historic overview and recent developments toward military and clinical relevance,"Bialas C., Moser C., Sims C.A.",2019,The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,"Packed red blood cells are a critical component in the resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock.

Metabolomics of childhood exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances: a cross-sectional study,"Kingsley S.L., Walker D.I., Calafat A.M., Chen A., Papandonatos G.D., Xu Y., Jones D.P., Lanphear B.P., Pennell K.D., Braun J.M.",2019,Metabolomics,"Introduction: Exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), synthetic and persistent chemicals used in commercial and industrial processes, are associated with cardiometabolic dysfunction and related risk factors including reduced birth weight, excess adiposity, and dyslipidemia. Identifying the metabolic changes induced by PFAS exposure could enhance our understanding of biological pathways underlying PFAS toxicity. Objective: To identify metabolic alterations associated with serum concentrations of four PFAS in children using a metabolome-wide association study. Methods: We performed untargeted metabolomic profiling by liquid chromatography with ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry, and separately quantified serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) for 114 8-year old children from Cincinnati, OH. We evaluated associations between each serum PFAS concentration and 16,097 metabolic features using linear regression adjusted for child age, sex, and race with a false discovery rate < 20%. We annotated PFAS-associated metabolites and conducted pathway enrichment analyses. Results: Serum PFAS concentrations were associated with metabolic features annotated primarily as lipids and dietary factors. Biological pathways associated with all four PFAS included arginine, proline, aspartate, asparagine, and butanoate metabolism. Conclusions: In this cross-sectional study, childhood serum PFAS concentrations were correlated with metabolic pathways related to energy production and catabolism. Future studies should determine whether these pathways mediate associations between PFAS exposure and childhood cardiometabolic health. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; lipid; octanoic acid derivative; sulfonic acid derivative; Article; child; cross-sectional study; electrospray; exposure; female; high performance liquid chromatography; human; hydrophilic interaction chromatography; limit of detection; liquid chromatography; male; mass spectrometry; metabolomics; retention time; reversed phase liquid chromatography; blood; energy metabolism; environmental exposure; metabolism; statistical model; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Energy Metabolism; Environmental Exposure; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Linear Models; Lipids; Male; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metabolomics; Sulfonic Acids,Springer New York LLC
Characterization of the binding of per- and poly-fluorinated substances to proteins: A methodological review,"Liu X., Fang M., Xu F., Chen D.",2019,TrAC - Trends in Analytical Chemistry,"Per- and poly-fluorinated substances (PFASs) are known to have the potential of binding to certain proteins. Protein binding is important to the understanding of cellular toxicities, biotransformation pathways, and the fate of selected PFASs. In this work, we provide a systematic review of major approaches to characterizing PFAS-protein binding, including the techniques based on separation, calorimetry, spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance, molecular docking, and surfactant nature of PFASs. These approaches enable qualitative and/or quantitative characterization of binding parameters, such as the binding affinity constant and binding stoichiometry.

"Analysis of F-53B, Gen-X, ADONA, and emerging fluoroalkylether substances in environmental and biomonitoring samples: A review","Munoz G., Liu J., Vo Duy S., Sauvé S.",2019,Trends in Environmental Analytical Chemistry,"The persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic properties of certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) raise concerns for environmental and human health. This has led to the gradual phase-out from production and commerce of some legacy PFAS. Fluoroalkylether compounds (ether-PFAS) are among the fluorinated alternative chemicals that are beginning to be reported in impacted and background environments. Extensive monitoring activities were conducted since 2015–2019 to bridge knowledge gaps on the environmental fate and effects of ether-PFAS including F-53B (6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate [6:2 Cl-PFAES] and 8:2 Cl-PFAES), Gen-X (hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid [HFPO-DA]), and ADONA (dodecafluoro-3H-4,8-dioxanonanoate). In recent years, advances in nontarget screening using high-resolution mass spectrometry have revealed the identities of other infrequently monitored ether-PFAS. In this critical review, we provide an up-to-date inventory of the structures of ether-PFAS discovered in the recent literature. Their environmental occurrence, fate, and effects are discussed on a comparative perspective with some legacy PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). Information on the methods employed for the quantitative and semi-quantitative analysis of ether-PFAS is also provided, including sample preparation and mass spectrometry analysis, analytical performance, and limitations. In particular, the compiled database of MS/MS fragment ions (n = 111) can be useful in spectrum interpretation of novel ether-PFAS. The concluding remarks open on possible research avenues and the challenges that remain to be addressed. © 2019",6:2 Cl-PFAES; ADONA; Chlorinated ether PFAS; F-53 B; Fluoroalkylether compounds; Gen-X; HFPO-DA; HFPO-TA; LC–MS/MS analysis; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs),,Elsevier B.V.
"Microwave-assisted extraction of pharmaceuticals, personal care products and industrial contaminants in the environment","Llompart M., Celeiro M., Dagnac T.",2019,TrAC - Trends in Analytical Chemistry,"Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE)is a well-established automated green extraction technique, offering many advantages such as the combined reduction of the extraction time, solvent and energy consumptions, as well as the possibility of performing simultaneous multiple extractions, thus increasing the number of samples processed daily. This review provides a comprehensive description of the most relevant analytical methods and applications, proposed from year 2012, for the extraction of selected emerging pollutants, including pharmaceuticals and veterinary drugs, personal care products, as well as industrial contaminants, in environmental matrices. The novel developments and last technological trends such as the implementation of organic solvent-free extraction methods, the use of surfactants and ionic liquids, the combination with microextraction approaches or the introduction of systems that sequentially process the samples, are also addressed. Overall, MAE appears to be an excellent alternative for the determination of emerging organic pollutants, thereby enabling its application within the regulatory environmental field. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Bisphenol A; Flame retardants; Microwave assisted extraction; Personal care products; Pharmaceuticals; Phenolic compounds; Plasticizers; Veterinary drugs,"Drug products; Energy utilization; Flame retardants; Ionic liquids; Organic pollutants; Phenols; Plasticizers; Solvents; Bis-phenol a; Microwave-assisted extraction; Personal care products; Phenolic compounds; Veterinary drugs; Solvent extraction; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzenesulfonamide derivative; benzophenone; benzotriazole derivative; cetrimide; ciprofloxacin; danofloxacin; enrofloxacin; gasoline; industrial chemical; levofloxacin; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; nordifloxacin; norfloxacin; perfluoro compound; polybrominated diphenyl ether; sulfamerazine; sulfamethoxazole; triclosan; aqueous solution; derivatization; dispersion; extraction and extracts; gel permeation chromatography; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liquid liquid extraction; mass fragmentography; matrix solid phase dispersion; microwave assisted extraction; pressurized liquid extraction; priority journal; Review; sediment; sludge; solid phase microextraction; solvent extraction; solvent free extraction; supercritical fluid extraction; ultra performance liquid chromatography; ultrasound assisted extraction; waste water treatment plant",Elsevier B.V.
Similar postoperative patient-reported outcome in both second generation patellofemoral arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty for treatment of isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis: a systematic review,"Bunyoz K.I., Lustig S., Troelsen A.",2019,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy","Introduction: Due to inconsistent results and high failure rates, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is more often used to treat isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) despite the theoretical advantage of patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA). It is perceived that second-generation PFA may have improved the outcomes of surgery. In this systematic review, the primary aim was to compare outcomes of second-generation PFA and TKA by assessment of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Methods: A systematic search was made in PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and MeSH to identify studies using second-generation PFA implants or TKA for treatment of PFOA. Only studies using The American Knee Society (AKSS), The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) or The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) to report on PROMs were included. Results: The postoperative weighted mean AKSS knee scores were 88.6 in the second-generation PFA group and 91.8 in the TKA group. The postoperative weighted mean AKSS function score was 79.5 in the second-generation PFA group and 86.4 in the TKA group. There was no significant difference in the mean AKSS knee or function scores between the second-generation PFA group and the TKA group. The postoperative weighted mean OKS score was 36.7 and the postoperative weighted mean WOMAC score was 24.4. The revision rate was higher in the second-generation PFA group (113 revisions [8.4%]) than in the TKA group (3 revisions [1.3%]). Progression of OA was most commonly noted as the reason for revision of PFA, and it was noted in 60 cases [53.1%]; this was followed by pain in 33 cases [29.2%]. Conclusion: Excellent postoperative weighted mean AKSS knee scores were found in both the second-generation PFA group and in the TKA group, suggesting that both surgical options can result in a satisfying patient-reported outcome. Higher revision rates in the second-generation PFA studies may in part be due to challenges related to patient selection. Based on evaluation of PROMs, the use of second-generation PFA seems to be an equal option to TKA for treatment of isolated PFOA in appropriately selected patients. Hopefully, this can be considered by physicians in their daily clinical work.

Proximal femoral nails antirotation and dynamic hip screws for fixation of unstable intertrochanteric fractures of femur: A meta-analysis,"Zhang Y.R., Rao F., Pi W., Zhang P.X., Jiang B.G.",2019,Beijing da xue xue bao. Yi xue ban = Journal of Peking University. Health sciences,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) and dynamic hip screw (DHS) for unstable intertrochanteric fractures using meta-analysis. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Cocharane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, China Science and Technology Papers and Citation Database (CSTPCD) and China Journal Full-text Database (CNKI) were searched for published randomized controlled trials before January 1, 2019. Two researchers independently screened the literature in the light of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, evaluated the quality of the studies and extracted the data which were consisted of clinical efficacy indexes, such as incision length, operation time,intraoperative blood loss, weight-bearing time,fracture-healing time, Harris hip score and safety indicators like complications. Meta-analysis was performed with the Revman 5.3 software provided by Cochrane Community in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) standard. RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled trials met the requirement with a total of 779 patients, of whom 383 were fixed with PFNA and 396 with DHS. Meta-analysis demonstrated that PFNA was associated with smaller surgical incision length [MD=-7.43, 95%CI (-9.31, -5.55), P<0.05], shorter operation time [MD=-22.76, 95%CI (-29.57, -11.95), P<0.05], less intraoperative blood loss [MD=-216.34, 95%CI (-275.18, - 157.49), P<0.05], earlier weight bearing after surgery [MD=-12.34, 95%CI (-17.71, -6.97), P<0.05], shorter fracture healing time [MD=-5.00, 95%CI (-7.73, -2.26), P<0.05], higher postoperative Harris hip score [MD=12.22, 95%CI (3.88, 20.55), P<0.05], higher rate of excellent Harris hip score [OR=3.56, 95%CI (1.44, 8.81), P<0.05] and lower incidence rate of postoperative complications [OR=0.48, 95%CI (0.33, 0.70), P<0.05], such as hip varus, wound infection, urinary tract infection, pulmonary infection, pressure sore, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, heart failure and cerebral infraction when compared with DHS. No statistical difference was shown between the groups when it came to subgroup analysis by age. However, there was no significant difference (P>0.05) in the duration of hospitalization and the complications resulting in the occurrences of internal fixation loosening, such as femoral shaft fracture (during or post operation), internal fixation fracture, cut-out, displacement or retraction. CONCLUSION: Current published evidence supports the superiority of PFNA to DHS for unstable intertrochanteric fractures in terms of clinical efficacy. The conclusion was limited because of the relatively low quality of evidence with low strength of confidence. Large scale and high-quality randomized controlled trials are required to validate the safety of PFNA and DHS for unstable intertrochanteric fractures.",,"bone nail; bone screw; China; femur; femur fracture; hip fracture; human; meta analysis; osteosynthesis; Bone Nails; Bone Screws; China; Femoral Fractures; Femur; Fracture Fixation, Internal; Hip Fractures; Humans",NLM (Medline)
Simultaneous debromination and mineralization of bromophenol in an up-flow electricity-stimulated anaerobic system,"Chen D., Shen J., Jiang X., Su G., Han W., Sun X., Li J., Mu Y., Wang L.",2019,Water Research,"Due to highly recalcitrant and toxicological nature of halogenated organic compounds, conventional anaerobic dehalogenation is often limited by low removal rate and poor process stability. Besides, the reduction intermediates or products formed during dehalogenation process, which are still toxic, required further energy-intensive aerobic post-treatment. In this study, an up-flow electricity-stimulated anaerobic system (ESAS) was developed by installing cathode underneath and anode above to realize simultaneous anaerobic debromination and mineralization of 4-bromophenol (4-BP). When cathode potential was −600 mV, high TOC removal efficiency (98.78 ± 0.96%), complete removal of 4-BP and phenol could be achieved at 4-BP loading rate of 0.58 mol m−3 d−1, suggesting debrominated product of 4-BP from cathode (i.e., phenol) would be utilized as the fuel by the bioanode of ESAS. Under high 4-BP loading rate (2.32 mol m−3 d−1) and low electron donor dosage (4.88 mM), 4-BP could be completely removed at acetate usage ratio as low as 4.21 ± 1.42 mol acetate mol−1 4-BP removal in ESAS, whereas only 13.45 ± 1.38% of 4-BP could be removed at acetate usage ratio as high as 31.28 ± 3.38 mol acetate mol−1 4-BP removal in control reactor. Besides, electrical stimulation distinctly facilitated the growth of various autotrophic dehalogenation species, phenol degradation related species, fermentative species, homoacetogens and electrochemically active species in ESAS. Moreover, based on the identified intermediates and the bacterial taxonomic analysis, possible metabolism mechanism involved in enhanced anaerobic debromination and mineralization of 4-BP in ESAS was proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Anaerobic reduction; Debromination; Electrochemical stimulation; Microbial community; Mineralization,Biodegradation; Cathodes; Dehalogenation; Phenols; Reduction; Anaerobic reduction; Debromination; Electrochemical stimulation; Microbial communities; Mineralization; Mineralogy; 4 bromophenol; acetic acid; organohalogen derivative; unclassified drug; phenol; anoxic conditions; bacterium; biomineralization; chemical compound; chemical reaction; degradation; metabolism; microbial activity; microbial community; mineralization; phenol; pollutant removal; reduction; simulation; total organic carbon; anaerobic digestion; Arcobacter; Article; autotrophy; Bacteroidetes; biofilm; Comamonas; community structure; controlled study; current density; debromination; dehalogenation; Desulfovibrio; electrochemical analysis; electron; electrostimulation; Flavobacterium; microbial community; microbial diversity; mineralization; Mollicutes; nonhuman; priority journal; Proteobacteria; spirochete; taxonomy; Thermotogae; Thiobacillus; Treponema; waste component removal; anaerobic growth; electricity; electrode; halogenation; Bacteria (microorganisms); Anaerobiosis; Electricity; Electrodes; Halogenation; Phenol,Elsevier Ltd
Advances in environmental research. volume 68,Daniels J.A.,2019,Advances in environmental research. volume 68,"Chapter one of Advances in Environmental Research. Volume 68 contains a rudimentary inferential analysis concerning conditions in the US such as the variation of the atmospheric content of carbon dioxide over two hundred and seventy two years up to 2016, and the contribution of major environmental sources to the atmospheric amount of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and methane along with emissions caused by hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphurhexafluoride and nitrogentrifluoride. The following chapter aims to present an overview of environmentally exploitable properties, as well as present and potential prospects of bacterial extracellular polymeric substances in addressing real life environmental problems. The authors go on to review the heavy metal processes that occur in the soil and leafy vegetables, particularly in cabbage, and the relationships between the soil levels and metal contents in plants.An approach for the utilization of microorganisms from shallow hydrothermal vent sediments in environmental biotechnology is also presented. Next, it is shown that that SDG 13 and SDG 15 can be addressed simultaneously if policy makers and practitioners focus on reducing the costs of telecommunications and the internet, as this would reduce the costs for tablets and mobile phones, enabling improved access to information and practice on Ecosystem Based Adaptation and microforestry schemes. The authors discuss the responsibility of the Water Board of Nicosia to operate the water distribution network that covers more than 91 sq. km, water mains of 1,280 km length, and the management of the 13 water reservoirs. They also show how water management is governed and how it affects theiIsland of Cyprus. The subsequent study indicates that concentrations of trace elements in sediments and brackish wate,r and even interstitious waters, may not provide an accurate view of the levels of contamination and their potential ecotoxicity in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. The closing paper focuses on the land-use/cover dynamicity and its impact on the land surface temperature of Lodhama river basin in Darjeeling Hill area during the period of 2001 and 2016. © 2019 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

General metallic-dielectric structures: A characteristic mode analysis using volume-surface formulations,Wu Q.,2019,IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine,"In this article, the characteristic mode analysis (CMA) of general metallic-dielectric structures is performed using the volume-surface integral equation (VSIE). The whole-structure and substructure formulations for the CMA are presented and discussed. It is proven that only the substructure operator is symmetrical and therefore fulfills CMA's theoretic requirements. Such a symmetrical operator ensures that the computed eigencurrents are orthogonal and the eigenvalues are real numbers. Numerical analysis verifies that the substructure formulation yields more accurate results than the whole-structure one. A smartphone chassis on an FR-4 substrate and a split-ring resonator (SRR) on a Teflon substrate are analyzed using the presented method. The influence of the mesh size is discussed and it is shown that the volume mesh density increases at a rate similar to the surface mesh. In short, the volume-surface integral formulation with a substructure treatment is versatile, stable, and reasonably efficient for the CMA of thin metallicdielectric structures with planar or curved shapes. © 1990-2011 IEEE.",,Dielectric materials; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Integral equations; Mesh generation; Characteristic modes; Curved shapes; Dielectric structure; FR4 substrates; Split-ring resonators (SRR); Surface integrals; Teflon substrate; Volume surface integral equations; Ring gages,IEEE Computer Society
Socioeconomic position and exposure to multiple environmental chemical contaminants in six European mother-child cohorts,"Montazeri P., Thomsen C., Casas M., de Bont J., Haug L.S., Maitre L., Papadopoulou E., Sakhi A.K., Slama R., Saulnier P.J., Urquiza J., Grazuleviciene R., Andrusaityte S., McEachan R., Wright J., Chatzi L., Basagaña X., Vrijheid M.",2019,International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health,"Background: Human exposure to environmental chemical contaminants at critical periods of development can lead to lifelong health consequences. Traditionally, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are thought to experience higher contaminant exposures; however, this relationship may not hold for all contaminants. Methods: Using data from six European birth cohorts (1301 mother-child pairs), we determined biomarkers of exposure to 41 contaminants in biological samples from children (6–12 years) and their mothers during pregnancy, including organochlorine compounds (OCs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), metals, phthalate metabolites, phenols, and organophosphate (OP) pesticide metabolites. We analyzed these biomarkers with several socioeconomic position (SEP) indicators (maternal education, employment status and family affluence scale). Results: Higher SEP was associated with higher concentrations of several chemicals during pregnancy, including certain PFASs, mercury, arsenic, several phenols, and OP pesticides. Similarly, childhood concentrations of OCs, PFASs, mercury, arsenic, and bisphenol A were higher in higher SEP groups. Conversely, cadmium exposure during pregnancy and exposure to lead and phthalate metabolites in childhood were higher in lower SEP. Principal components representing multiple pollutant exposures showed similar association with SEP. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that environmental chemical contaminant exposure during fetal and childhood life is not exclusively associated to lower SEP and that for several contaminants higher SEP groups incur higher exposure levels. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH",,biological marker; adult; analysis; child; cohort analysis; environmental exposure; female; human; maternal exposure; metabolism; pollutant; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; socioeconomics; toxicity; Adult; Biomarkers; Child; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Socioeconomic Factors,Elsevier GmbH

As a bioelectrochemical hybrid system, microbial fuel cells involved in electricity generation and wastewater treatment including nutrients recovery with tremendous benefits such as energy saving, reduced sludge generation and energy conversion. In this review, we mainly emphasize the developments and advancements of electrode and membrane materials for increasing the microbial fuel cell performances in recent years. We reviewed and discussed the different categories of electrode (anode and cathode) materials with various structural, dimensional, compositions and integrations. Moreover, it encloses the cost-effective, biocompatible and highly stable electrode materials with improved microbial fuel cell performance. Using hetero-atom doped 3-Dimensional porous carbon with ultra-fine metal nanoparticles, a large surface area of the electrode material with different dimensional, and new core@shell structure can considerably enhance the oxygen reduction reaction performance during the microbial fuel cell operation. Following this overview, development in membrane materials such as perfluorinated polymer, hydrocarbon polymer, organic-organic hybrid polymer, organic-inorganic hybrid composite, ceramics, and biopolymer membranes are explained in detail. Based on the physical, chemical, mechanical and biocompatible properties, the hybrid composite biopolymer membrane with organic and inorganic additives are recommended as a suitable membrane candidate for increasing the ion conductivity and rectifying the biofouling issues during the long term operation. Finally, the future viewpoints in the microbial fuel cell for effective wastewater treatment process with electricity generation are suggested through various aspects and strategies to afford clean energy and environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Alternative energy; Electrodes; Membranes; Microbial fuel cells; Microorganisms; Wastewater treatment,Additives; Anodes; Biocompatibility; Biological materials; Biomolecules; Cathodes; Composite membranes; Cost effectiveness; Electric power generation; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Energy conservation; Fuel cells; Gas fuel purification; Hybrid systems; Metal fuels; Metal nanoparticles; Microbial fuel cells; Microorganisms; organic-inorganic materials; Polymers; Porous materials; Reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Alternative energy; Electricity generation; Fuel cell performance; Fuel cell technologies; Organic-inorganic hybrid composites; Oxygen reduction reaction; Perfluorinated polymers; Wastewater treatment process; Membranes,Elsevier Ltd
"Roflumilast analogs with improved metabolic stability, plasma protein binding, and pharmacokinetic profile","Moussa B.A., El-Zaher A.A., El-Ashrey M.K., Fouad M.A.",2019,Drug Testing and Analysis,"With the aim of studying their in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetics, new chromatographic methods were developed for the determination of three new roflumilast synthetic analogs (I−III) as PDE-4B inhibitors in rat liver S9 fraction, phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, and human and rat plasma. The developed high performance liquid chromatography−ultra violet (HPLC−UV) methods were performed on a Zorbax Eclipse C8 column and UV detection was carried out at 215 nm. The three compounds were tested for their metabolic stability and were found to be metabolically more stable than roflumilast especially the 2-mercaptobenzothiazol-6-yl analog (III) which displayed an in vitro half-life time (247.55 minutes) higher than that of roflumilast (12.29 minutes) and a low in vitro clearance of 5.67 mL/min./kg. Possible phase I metabolites were investigated using ultra-performance liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) showing hydroxylation of the unsubstituted benzothiazol-2-yl (I) and benzothiazole-6-yl (II) analogs and a cleaved benzothiazole metabolite of the 2-mercaptobenzothiazol-6-yl analog (III). Plasma protein binding affinity was tested using equilibrium membrane dialysis method showing a very high percentage (more than 95%) of plasma protein binding of compounds I and II where compound III exhibited lower percentage (53.71%) demonstrating its accessibility for tissue distribution. Also, a UPLC–MS/MS method was developed using an Acquity UPLC BEH shield RP C18 column to be applied to an in vivo pharmacokinetic study in rats following a subcutaneous dose (1 mg/kg). Compounds I−III showed improved in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters especially compound III which displayed a half-life 3-fold greater than roflumilast (21 hours) and a Cmax value of 113.958 ng/mL. Accordingly, this new chemical entity should be subjected to further investigation as it can be a good drug candidate for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",metabolic stability; pharmacokinetics; phosphodiesterase 4B inhibitors; plasma protein binding; roflumilast,"2 mercaptobenzothiazol 6 yl; benzothiazol 2 yl derivative; benzothiazole 6 yl derivative; benzothiazole derivative; buffer; drug metabolite; phosphate; phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor; roflumilast; roflumilast derivative; sodium chloride; unclassified drug; aminopyridine derivative; benzamide derivative; cyclopropane derivative; phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor; plasma protein; protein binding; roflumilast; animal tissue; Article; binding affinity; chemical analysis; chromatography; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; drug clearance; drug half life; drug metabolism; drug stability; equilibrium membrane dialysis; high performance liquid chromatography; human; hydroxylation; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver; nonhuman; pH; pharmacokinetics; priority journal; protein binding; rat; tissue distribution; triple quadrupole mass spectrometry; ultra performance liquid chromatography; ultraviolet spectroscopy; animal; blood; chemistry; male; metabolism; procedures; Sprague Dawley rat; tandem mass spectrometry; validation study; Aminopyridines; Animals; Benzamides; Blood Proteins; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Cyclopropanes; Humans; Liver; Male; Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors; Protein Binding; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",John Wiley and Sons Ltd

"Optimized gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for 1,1′-sulfonylbis[2-(methylthio) ethane] quantification in human urine","Eyison R.K., Sezigen S., Ortatatli M., Kenar L.",2019,Journal of Chromatographic Science,"Sulfur mustard (SM) which is a bifunctional alkylating vesicant is one of the mostly used chemical warfare agent in First World War and the Iran-Iraq War. β-Lyase metabolites of SM especially 1,1′-sulfonylbis[2-(methylthio)ethane] (SBMTE) is an unequivocal biomarker of the exposure. An optimized gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the retrospective detection of SBMTE in human urine. Urine samples were treated with acidic titanium trichloride to reduce β-lyase metabolites to the single analyte SBMTE. After neutralization and precipitation, SBMTE was extracted from urine by C8 solid-phase extraction cartridge and analyzed in the multiple-reaction monitoring mode. The lower limit of quantification was 1 ng/mL with relative standard deviation of <10%. Acceptable intra-day and inter-day precisions and accuracies were obtained. The developed method was successfully measured various levels of SBMTE which could be used as the forensic evidence of such a chemical attack. © 2019 The Author(s).

Emerging pollutants in the urban water cycle in Latin America: A review of the current literature,"Peña-Guzmán C., Ulloa-Sánchez S., Mora K., Helena-Bustos R., Lopez-Barrera E., Alvarez J., Rodriguez-Pinzón M.",2019,Journal of Environmental Management,"Emerging pollutants (EP) are increasingly studied and characterized worldwide to improve the understanding of their environmental and toxicological impacts and their occurrence and behaviors in different environmental systems. Latin America has been subject to both environmental and toxicological impacts due to EP. To better understand these impacts, studies concerning pollutants have increased for the last ten years. The current study presents a critical review on the occurrence of different emerging pollutants in various components of the urban water cycle (UWC) in Latin America. The review is based on studies performed in 11 different countries between 1999 and 2018. The countries where the higher number of investigations were conducted are Brazil (53%) and Mexico (15%). The EP most often studied within the literature are pharmaceuticals, followed by personal care products. The most common EP reported were 17β-estradiol, bisphenol A and estrone; The UWC component with the greatest number of measurements in the reported studies were effluents from wastewater treatment plants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Emerging pollutants; Latin America; Urban water cycle,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; chemical agent; drinking water; drug metabolite; endocrine disruptor; estradiol; estrone; flame retardant; food additive; hydrocarbon; illicit drug; pesticide; pharmaceutical vehicles and additives; surface water; chemical compound; chemical pollutant; effluent; environmental impact; hydrological cycle; literature review; pollutant removal; PPCP; toxicology; wastewater; wastewater treatment plant; effluent; emerging pollutant; human; pollutant; Review; South and Central America; urban area; urban population; waste water management; water cycle; water pollutant; water supply; Brazil; environmental monitoring; Mexico; waste water; water cycle; water pollutant; Brazil; Latin America; Mexico [North America]; Brazil; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Latin America; Mexico; Waste Water; Water Cycle; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Academic Press
Trace metals and persistent organic pollutants contamination in batoids (Chondrichthyes: Batoidea): A systematic review,"Bezerra M.F., Lacerda L.D., Lai C.-T.",2019,Environmental Pollution,"Batoids (Chondrichthyes: Batoidea; e.g. stingrays, skates, and guitarfish) comprise more than 55% of elasmobranch taxa and represent ecologically important predators in benthic and pelagic habitats. Although overexploitation and habitat degradation are the two biggest threats to batoid populations, coastal and oceanic pollution is also a pervasive potential threat. In this systematic review, we compile published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea superorder and present contamination patterns, exposure effects, and potential human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found batoids to accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Accumulation of POPs is reported for chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Hg levels in muscle tissue were significantly different among oceanic basins and habitats, consistent with previous global assessments of Hg oceanic background levels. Some batoid species presented Hg levels higher than large pelagic teleost fishes and comparable to sharks. Ecological traits such as, bottom feeding, upper trophic position and elasmobranch-specific physiology and metabolism are discussed as potential factors associated with Hg uptake and accumulation in batoids. Some species exceeded USEPA's maximum contamination safety limits in edible tissues for Hg, As and ΣPCBs. For most trace metals and POPs, there is a lack of studies focusing on contamination levels in batoids. We recommend future research increasing reporting on POPs and trace metals besides Hg in batoids to further investigate the role of Elasmobranch as a bioindicator for marine pollution. © 2019 Elsevier LtdWe surveyed literature on 65 batoids species and found a large range of reported inorganic and organic contaminants at levels below food safety limits, except for Hg, As and PCB. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Elasmobranch; Inorganic contaminants; Mercury; Organochlorine; Pollution,"Chemical contamination; Contamination; Ecosystems; Insecticides; Marine pollution; Mercury (metal); Metals; Pollution; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Tissue; Trace elements; Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane; Elasmobranch; Inorganic contaminants; Organochlorines; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Persistent organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB); Organic pollutants; alkyl group; arsenic acid; bismuth; cadmium; chlordane; chlorphenotane; chromium; cobalt; copper; dieldrin; heptachlor epoxide; hexachlorobenzene; iron; lead; manganese; mercury; nickel; palladium; perfluoro compound; platinum; polychlorinated biphenyl; rhodium; rubidium; selenium; strontium; tin; trace metal; unindexed drug; vanadium; zinc; chlorinated hydrocarbon; environmental marker; heavy metal; trace element; bioindicator; chemical pollutant; literature review; marine pollution; mercury (element); organochlorine; persistent organic pollutant; pollution exposure; shark; teleost; trace metal; bioaccumulation; cartilaginous fish; concentration (parameter); egg; egg yolk; environmental exposure; fin (organ); foraging; geographical variation (species); gill; health hazard; intestine tissue; kidney tissue; liver tissue; muscle; nonhuman; ovum; persistent organic pollutant; pollution transport; population exposure; Review; systematic review; tissue level; water contamination; analysis; animal; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; human; metabolism; procedures; skate (fish); water pollutant; Batoidea; Chondrichthyes; Dasyatidae; Rhinobatidae; Teleostei; Animals; Ecosystem; Environmental Biomarkers; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Metals, Heavy; Skates (Fish); Trace Elements; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier Ltd
Assessing the human health risks of perfluorooctane sulfonate by in vivo and in vitro studies,"Zeng Z., Song B., Xiao R., Zeng G., Gong J., Chen M., Xu P., Zhang P., Shen M., Yi H.",2019,Environment International,"The wide use of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has led to increasing concern about its human health risks over the past decade. In vivo and in vitro studies are important and effective means to ascertain the toxic effects of PFOS on humans and its toxic mechanisms. This article systematically reviews the human health risks of PFOS based on the currently known facts found by in vivo and in vitro studies from 2008 to 2018. Exposure to PFOS has caused hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, immunotoxicity, thyroid disruption, cardiovascular toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, and renal toxicity in laboratory animals and many in vitro human systems. These results and related epidemiological studies confirmed the human health risks of PFOS, especially for exposure via food and drinking water. Oxidative stress and physiological process disruption based on fatty acid similarity were widely studied mechanisms of PFOS toxicity. Future research for assessing the human health risks of PFOS is recommended in the chronic toxicity and molecular mechanisms, the application of various omics, and the integration of toxicological and epidemiological data. © 2019",Human health risk; In vitro; In vivo; PFOS,Fatty acids; Health; Potable water; Risk assessment; Toxicity; Epidemiological studies; Human health risks; In-vitro; In-vivo; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; PFOS; Physiological process; Reproductive toxicities; Health risks; fatty acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; assessment method; epidemiology; health risk; oxidative stress; physiology; public health; sulfonate; toxicity; cardiotoxicity; chronic toxicity; disease surveillance; epidemiological data; exposure; fatty acid analysis; food contamination; health hazard; human; immunotoxicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver toxicity; lung toxicity; molecular interaction; nephrotoxicity; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; omics; oxidative stress; physiological process; priority journal; reproductive toxicity; Review; risk assessment; systematic review; thyroid disease; toxicology; water contamination; animal; pollutant; risk assessment; toxicity; Animalia; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Risk Assessment,Elsevier Ltd
Physiology-based toxicokinetic modelling in the frame of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative,"Sarigiannis D.A., Karakitsios S., Dominguez-Romero E., Papadaki K., Brochot C., Kumar V., Schumacher M., Sy M., Mielke H., Greiner M., Mengelers M., Scheringer M.",2019,Environmental Research,"Given the opportunities provided by internal dosimetry modelling in the interpretation of human biomonitoring (HBM) data, the assessment of the links between exposure to chemicals and observed HBM data can be effectively supported by PBTK modelling. This paper gives a comprehensive review of available human PBTK models for compounds selected as a priority by the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU). We highlight their advantages and deficiencies and suggest steps for advanced internal dose modelling. The review of the available PBTK models highlighted the conceptual differences between older models compared to the ones developed recently, reflecting commensurate differences in research questions. Due to the lack of coordinated strategies for deriving useful biomonitoring data for toxicokinetic properties, significant problems in model parameterisation still remain; these are further increased by the lack of human toxicokinetic data due to ethics issues. Finally, questions arise as well as to the extent they are really representative of interindividual variability. QSARs for toxicokinetic properties is a complementary approach for PBTK model parameterisation, especially for data poor chemicals. This approach could be expanded to model chemico-biological interactions such as intestinal absorption and renal clearance; this could serve the development of more complex generic PBTK models that could be applied to newly derived chemicals. Another gap identified is the framework for mixture interaction terms among compounds that could eventually interact in metabolism. From the review it was concluded that efforts should be shifted toward the development of generic multi-compartmental and multi-route models, supported by targeted biomonitoring coupled with parameterisation by both QSAR approach and experimental (in-vivo and in-vitro) data for newly developed and data poor compounds. © 2019",HBM4EU; Human biomonitoring; Internal dose; PBTK modelling,"aniline; bromine derivative; cadmium; chlorpyrifos; chromium derivative; flame retardant; perfluoro compound; phenol derivative; phthalic acid; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; absorption; biomonitoring; developmental biology; dose-response relationship; metabolism; modeling; physiology; toxicology; biological monitoring; experimental model; intestine absorption; metabolism; physiologically based pharmacokinetic model; priority journal; quantitative structure activity relation; renal clearance; Review; toxicokinetics; biological model; biological monitoring; human; Biological Monitoring; Humans; Models, Biological; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Toxicokinetics",Academic Press Inc.
Selectivity evaluation of phenyl based stationary phases for the analysis of amino acid diastereomers by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry,"Moldovan R.-C., Bodoki E., Servais A.-C., Crommen J., Oprean R., Fillet M.",2019,Journal of Chromatography A,"D-amino acids (AA) analysis is becoming more and more relevant for metabolomics, therefore new analytical tools need to be developed. A common approach to achieve AA enantioseparation is chiral derivatization. Among the chiral derivatization reagents, (+) or (-)-1-(9-fluorenyl) ethyl chloroformate ((+) or (-)-FLEC) has proved to be one of the most versatile. Suitable chiral selectivity for FLEC derivatives of amino acids could be obtained in reversed-phase HPLC using nonpolar stationary phases (C4, C8 and C18) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) based mobile phases. This study is meant to provide alternatives to the use of THF as organic modifier by evaluating the selectivity obtained on two phenyl based stationary phases for 19 FLEC-DL-AA pairs of diastereomers using UHPLC-MS. Several mobile phases consisting of ammonium acetate and different common organic solvents (acetonitrile (ACN), methanol (MeOH), 2-propanol (IPA)) were tested using gradient elution. Experimental design was employed for the optimization of the separation conditions. In the optimized conditions, complete chiral separation can be achieved for 18 out of 19 FLEC-DL-AAs in less than 30 min. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Amino acids; Biphenyl; Chiral separations; Derivatization; Diphenyl; FLEC,"Amino acids; Chirality; High performance liquid chromatography; Isomers; Mass spectrometry; Organic solvents; Separation; Biphenyl; Chiral separations; Derivatizations; Diphenyl; FLEC; Ascorbic acid; 1 (9 fluorenyl)ethyl chloroformate; 2 propanol; acetonitrile; alanine; amino acid derivative; ammonium acetate; arginine; asparagine; biphenyl; cysteine; glutamic acid; glutamine; histidine; isoleucine; leucine; lysine; methanol; methionine; phenylalanine; proline; reagent; serine; tetrahydrofuran; threonine; tryptophan; tyrosine; unclassified drug; valine; 1-(9-fluorenyl)ethyl chloroformate; amino acid; fluorene derivative; Article; chiral separation; controlled study; diastereoisomer; diastereoselectivity; elution; experimental design; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; mass spectrometry; pH; priority journal; reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; stereoselectivity; ultra performance liquid chromatography; chemistry; liquid chromatography; procedures; stereoisomerism; Amino Acids; Chromatography, Liquid; Fluorenes; Mass Spectrometry; Stereoisomerism",Elsevier B.V.
The overlooked short- and ultrashort-chain poly- and perfluorinated substances: A review,"Ateia M., Maroli A., Tharayil N., Karanfil T.",2019,Chemosphere,"Poly- and perfluorinated substances (PFAS) comprise more than 3000 individual compounds; nevertheless, most studies to date have focused mainly on the fate, transport and remediation of long-chain PFAS (C > 7). The main objective of this article is to provide the first critical review of the peer-reviewed studies on the analytical methods, occurrence, mobility, and treatment for ultra-short-chain PFAS (C = 2–3) and short-chain PFAS (C = 4–7). Previous studies frequently detected ultra-short-chain and short-chain PFAS in various types of aqueous environments including seas, oceans, rivers, surface/urban runoffs, drinking waters, groundwaters, rain/snow, and deep polar seas. Besides, the recent regulations and restrictions on the use of long-chain PFAS has resulted in a significant shift in the industry towards short-chain alternatives. However, our understanding of the environmental fate and remediation of these ultra-short-chain and short-chain PFAS is still fragmentary. We have also covered the handful studies involving the removal of ultra-short and short-chain PFAS and identified the future research needs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Mobility; Occurrence; Poly- and perfluorinated substances; Short-chain; Treatment technologies; Ultra-short-chain,Atmospheric chemistry; Carrier mobility; Chemistry; Analytical method; Aqueous environment; Critical review; Environmental fate; Occurrence; Poly- and perfluorinated substances; Research needs; Treatment technologies; Groundwater; drinking water; organofluorine derivative; perfluoro compound; polyfluorinated substance; rain; snow; sorbent; unclassified drug; water; chemical substance; element mobility; environmental fate; fatty acid; literature review; pollutant removal; pollutant transport; waste technology; waste treatment; analytic method; biotransformation; comprehension; environmental impact; high performance liquid chromatography; hydrophilicity; lipophilicity; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; polymerization; regulatory mechanism; Review; river; runoff; sea; surface property; total organic carbon,Elsevier Ltd
"Perfluorohexanoic acid toxicity, part I: Development of a chronic human health toxicity value for use in risk assessment","Luz A.L., Anderson J.K., Goodrum P., Durda J.",2019,Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology,"Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) is a short-chain, six-carbon perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) and is a primary impurity, degradant, and metabolite associated with the short-chain fluorotelomer-based chemistry used globally today. The transition to short-chain fluorotelomer-based products as a cornerstone in replacement fluorochemistry has raised questions regarding potential human health risks associated with exposure to fluorotelomer-based substances and therefore, PFHxA. Here, we present a critical review of data relevant to such a risk assessment, including epidemiological studies and in vivo and in vitro toxicity studies that examined PFHxA acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicity. Key findings from toxicokinetic and mode-of-action studies are also evaluated. Sufficient data exist to conclude that PFHxA is not carcinogenic, is not a selective reproductive or developmental toxicant, and does not disrupt endocrine activity. Collectively, effects caused by PFHxA exposure are largely limited to potential kidney effects, are mild and/or reversible, and occur at much higher doses than observed for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). A chronic human-health-based oral reference dose (RfD) for PFHxA of 0.25 mg/kg-day was calculated using benchmark dose modeling of renal papillary necrosis from a chronic rat bioassay. This RfD is four orders of magnitude greater than the chronic oral RfD calculated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for PFOA. The PFHxA RfD can be used to inform public health decisions related to PFHxA and fluorotelomer precursors for which PFHxA is a terminal degradant. These findings clearly demonstrate that PFHxA is less hazardous to human health than PFOA. The analyses presented support site-specific risk assessments as well as product stewardship initiatives for current and future short-chain fluorotelomer-based products. © 2019 The Authors",Benchmark dose; Fluorotelomers; Human health; Oral reference dose; Perfluorohexanoic acid; PFHxA,"perfluorohexanoic acid; thyroglobulin antibody; fluorocarbon; hexanoic acid derivative; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; animal experiment; Article; bioaccumulation; bioassay; chemical analysis; chemical structure; controlled study; electrochemistry; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; female; good laboratory practice; homozygosity; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; kidney cortex necrosis; liver toxicity; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; risk assessment; toxicokinetics; dose response; risk assessment; Caproates; Caprylates; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Risk Assessment",Academic Press Inc.
"Perfluorohexanoic acid toxicity, part II: Application of human health toxicity value for risk characterization","Anderson J.K., Luz A.L., Goodrum P., Durda J.",2019,Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology,"Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) is a short-chain, six-carbon PFAA and is a primary impurity, degradant, and metabolite associated with the short-chain fluorotelomer-based chemistry used in the United States, Europe and Japan today. With the shift towards short-chain PFAA chemistry, uncertainties remain regarding human health risks associated with current exposure levels. Here, we present a critical review and assessment of data relevant to human health risk assessment to today's short-chain PFAA chemistry. Human biomonitoring surveys indicate that PFHxA is infrequently detected in the environment as well as in human serum and urine; however, human health concerns may persist in locations where PFHxA is detected. In a companion paper (Luz et al., 2019) we comprehensively evaluate the available toxicity data for PFHxA, and derive a chronic human health-based reference dose (RfD) for PFHxA of 0.25 mg/kg-day based on benchmark dose modeling of renal papillary necrosis in chronically exposed female rats. In this paper, we apply this RfD in human health-based screening levels calculations, and derive a drinking water lifetime health advisory of 1400 μg/L and a residential groundwater screening level for children of 4000 μg/L. Compared to environmental concentration data, even sites with more elevated concentrations of PFHxA in the environment are at least an order of magnitude lower than these screening levels. Available PFHxA human serum and urine biomonitoring data, used as a biomarker for general population exposure, demonstrates that the general human population exposures to PFHxA are low. Previous estimates of daily intake rates for infants exposed to PFHxA through breast milk, formula, and baby foods (Lorenzo et al., 2016) combined with the most conservative PFHxA peer-reviewed toxicity value (Luz et al., 2019) demonstrate that the margin of safety for PFHxA is high. Therefore, PFHxA and related fluorotelomer precursors currently appear to present negligible human health risk to the general population and are not likely to drive or substantially contribute to risk at sites contaminated with PFAS mixtures. PFHxA may also represent a suitable marker for the safety of fluorotelomer replacement chemistry used today. © 2019",Fluorotelomers; Human health; Perfluorohexanoic acid; PFHxA; Risk characterization,"drinking water; ground water; perfluorohexanoic acid; biological marker; fluorocarbon; hexanoic acid derivative; perfluorohexanoic acid; animal experiment; animal model; Article; artificial milk; baby food; benchmarking; biological monitoring; blood analysis; breast milk; child; controlled study; female; health hazard; health survey; human; kidney papilla necrosis; male; newborn; nonhuman; peer review; population exposure; preschool child; priority journal; rat; residential area; risk assessment; screening test; toxicity; urinalysis; analysis; water pollutant; Biomarkers; Caproates; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Academic Press Inc.
Analysis of drug resistance genes and molecular typing of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella variicola strains [耐碳青霉烯类变栖克雷伯菌的耐药基因和分子分型研究],"Huang H., Huang Y., Gu D., Zhang R., Zhou H.",2019,Chinese Journal of Microbiology and Immunology (China),"Objective: To investigate the prevalence and drug resistance of clinical Klebsiella variicola (K.variicola) isolates and to illuminate the mechanism of drug resistance in carbapenem-resistant strains. Methods: Clinical K. variicola isolates were identified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The antimicrobial susceptibility profile of these strains was determined using broth microdilution. Resistance genes carried by carbapenem-resistant K. variicola strains were detected by PCR with specific primers. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used for molecular typing. A pan-drug resistant strain which was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid sample was analyzed with whole genome sequencing (WGS). Results: Twenty-six isolates were identified as K. variicola by MALDI-TOF MS. Results of the antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that there were 15.4% (4/26) resistant to carbapenem and 11.5% (3/26) unsusceptible to tigecycline. These strains were highly susceptible to amikacin and gentamicin, which accounted for 96.2% (25/26). As for the third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, the resistance rate was 23.1% (6/26). All of the four carbapenem-resistant isolates carried the resistance genes of blaIMP-4, qnrA/B and blaTEM, and one of them was also positive for blaNDM-1 gene. The fosfomycin resistance gene, fosA, was detected in three of them. Molecular typing analysis indicated these isolates belonged to two sequence types (ST) of ST357 (three strains) and ST1737 (one strain). Two plasmids were obtained from the pan-drug resistant strain by WGS, including IncFⅡ/FIB(k) type plasmid (160 kb) that was highly homologous to LMG 23571 plasmid (GenBank: CP013986.1) and IncHⅠ1B/FIB type plasmid (260 kb) sharing high homology with pIMP4_LL34 (GenBank: CP025964.1). Besides the resistance genes mentioned above, the two plasmids also carried a variety of other genes that mediated the resistance to aminoglycosides (strB, strA, armA, aac3-Ⅱd, aadA2), macrolides (msrE, mphE), chloramphenicol (catA2), sulfonamides (sulⅠ) tigecycline (tetA variant) and trimethoprim (dfrA16). However, no virulence genes were detected. Conclusions: In general, the resistance profile of K. variicola was similar to that of Klebsiella pneumoniae, but the differences were that carbapenem-resistant K. variicola strains mainly belonged to ST357 and the leading causes of resistance were carrying the genes encoding IMP-4 and NDM-1 metal β-lactamases. WGC analysis revealed that the pan-drug resistant K. variicola strain carried multiple drug resistance genes without virulence determinants, which might be resulted from the evolution of drug resistance.

Unfortunately, WWTPs are not designed to remove CECs and secondary (e.g., conventional activated sludge process, CAS) and tertiary (such as filtration and disinfection) treatments are not effective in the removal of most CECs entering WWTP. Accordingly, several advanced treatment methods have been investigated for the removal of CECs from wastewater, including consolidated (namely, activated carbon (AC) adsorption, ozonation and membranes) and new (such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)) processes/technologies. This review paper gathers the efforts of a group of international experts, members of the NEREUS COST Action ES1403 who for three years have been constructively discussing the state of the art and the best available technologies for the advanced treatment of urban wastewater. In particular, this work critically reviews the papers available in scientific literature on consolidated (ozonation, AC and membranes) and new advanced treatment methods (mainly AOPs) to analyse: (i) their efficiency in the removal of CECs from wastewater, (ii) advantages and drawbacks, (iii) possible obstacles to the application of AOPs, (iv) technological limitations and mid to long-term perspectives for the application of heterogeneous processes, and (v) a technical and economic comparison among the different processes/technologies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Activated carbon; Advanced oxidation processes; Oxidation by-products; Ozonation; Photocatalysis; Urban wastewater,"Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Activated sludge process; Aquatic organisms; Oxidation; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Photocatalysis; Advanced oxidation process; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Best available technologies; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Conventional activated sludges; Oxidation by-products; Urban wastewater; Urban wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; acesulfame; activated carbon; azithromycin; bezafibrate; carbamazepine; ciprofloxacin; clarithromycin; diclofenac; drinking water; erythromycin; estradiol; ethinylestradiol; iopromide; mecoprop; metformin; metoprolol; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; primidone; sulfamethoxazole; activated carbon; adsorption; catalysis; oxidation; ozonation; photolysis; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; acidity; adsorption; bacterial growth; chemical reaction; electrochemiluminescence; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; human; hydrodynamics; hydrophobicity; nanofiltration; osmosis; oxidation; ozonation; particle size; pH; photocatalysis; physical chemistry; priority journal; Review; sludge; surface property; turbidity; urban area; waste component removal; waste water; waste water treatment plant; water contamination; water pollution; water supply",Elsevier B.V.

Brachial plexus neuropathy by hibernoma compression: An unusual presentation of peripheral non-neural sheath nerve tumor and a systematic review of literature,"Sousa L.H.A., Chaves J.P.G., Marques R.A.M., Silva L.L.G.",2019,Neurology India,"Brachial plexus neuropathies are uncommon and are rarely caused by a tumor. The clinical presentation of a brachial plexus neuropathy caused by a tumor depends on the degree of malignancy of the tumor and its localization. We report an illustrative case of a 27-year old female subject with a progressively increasing mass lesion causing brachial plexus compression, ipsilateral shoulder pain, C8 dermatomal paresthesia, and impairment of motor power. The patient underwent surgical resection of the mass and neurolysis of the nerves in the vicinity. Following the surgical procedure, the patient had improvement in the pain and paresthesia that he was suffering from. The histopathological diagnosis revealed a hibernoma, an extremely rare tumor described only once previously in this location.

Removal of antibiotics from aqueous solutions by nanoparticles: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Malakootian M., Yaseri M., Faraji M.",2019,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Antibiotics, as one of the emerging pollutants, are non-biodegradable compounds and long-term exposure to them may affect endocrine, hormonal, and genetic systems of human beings, representing a potential risk for both the environment and human health. The presence of antibiotics in surface waters and drinking water causes a global health concern. Many researches have stated that conventional methods used for wastewater treatment cannot fully remove antibiotic residues, and they may be detected in receiving waters. It is reported that nanoparticles could remove these compounds even at low concentration and under varied conditions of pH. The current study aimed to review the most relevant publications reporting the use of different nanoparticles to remove antibiotics from aqueous solutions. Moreover, meta-analysis was conducted on the results of some articles. Results of meta-analysis proved that different nanoparticles could remove antibiotics with an acceptable efficiency of 61%. Finally, this review revealed that nanoparticles are promising and efficient materials for degradation and removal of antibiotics from water and wastewater solutions. Furthermore, future perspectives of the new generation nanostructure adsorbents were discussed in this study. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Adsorption; Drug; Emerging pollutants; Green synthesis; Nanotechnology; Water and wastewater treatment,"adsorption; antibiotics; aqueous solution; chemical pollutant; concentration (composition); degradation; drinking water; drug; literature review; meta-analysis; nanoparticle; nanotechnology; pollutant removal; surface water; wastewater; wastewater treatment; antiinfective agent; nanomaterial; nanoparticle; water; adsorption; analysis; chemistry; meta analysis; procedures; waste water; water management; water pollutant; Adsorption; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Nanoparticles; Nanostructures; Waste Water; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Springer Verlag
Mapping Salmonella typhimurium pathways using 13C metabolic flux analysis,"Correia D.M., Sargo C.R., Silva A.J., Santos S.T., Giordano R.C., Ferreira E.C., Zangirolami T.C., Ribeiro M.P.A., Rocha I.",2019,Metabolic Engineering,"In the last years, Salmonella has been extensively studied not only due to its importance as a pathogen, but also as a host to produce pharmaceutical compounds. However, the full exploitation of Salmonella as a platform for bioproduct delivery has been hampered by the lack of information about its metabolism. Genome-scale metabolic models can be valuable tools to delineate metabolic engineering strategies as long as they closely represent the actual metabolism of the target organism. In the present study, a 13C-MFA approach was applied to map the fluxes at the central carbon pathways of S. typhimurium LT2 growing at glucose-limited chemostat cultures. The experiments were carried out in a 2L bioreactor, using defined medium enriched with 20% 13C-labeled glucose. Metabolic flux distributions in central carbon pathways of S. typhimurium LT2 were estimated using OpenFLUX2 based on the labeling pattern of biomass protein hydrolysates together with biomass composition. The results suggested that pentose phosphate is used to catabolize glucose, with minor fluxes through glycolysis. In silico simulations, using Optflux and pFBA as simulation method, allowed to study the performance of the genome-scale metabolic model. In general, the accuracy of in silico simulations was improved by the superimposition of estimated intracellular fluxes to the existing genome-scale metabolic model, showing a better fitting to the experimental extracellular fluxes, whereas the intracellular fluxes of pentose phosphate and anaplerotic reactions were poorly described. © 2018 International Metabolic Engineering Society",13C-MFA; Chemostat culture; Genome-scale metabolic model; In silico simulation; Salmonella typhimurium,Carbon; Chemostats; Genes; Glucose; Metabolism; Physiology; Salmonella; Chemostat culture; Genome scale metabolic model; In-silico; Salmonella typhimurium; ^13C-MFA; Metabolic engineering; carbon; carbon 13; glucose; pentose phosphate; protein hydrolysate; carbon; accuracy; Article; bacterial genome; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterium culture; biomass; carbon metabolism; catabolism; computer simulation; glycolysis; mass fragmentography; metabolic engineering; metabolic flux analysis; nonhuman; priority journal; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; software; statistical analysis; bioreactor; chromosomal mapping; genetics; metabolic flux analysis; metabolism; procedures; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; Biomass; Bioreactors; Carbon Isotopes; Chromosome Mapping; Computer Simulation; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Glucose; Glycolysis; Metabolic Engineering; Metabolic Flux Analysis; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Salmonella typhimurium,Academic Press Inc.
Environmental applications of solid-phase microextraction,"Llompart M., Celeiro M., García-Jares C., Dagnac T.",2019,TrAC - Trends in Analytical Chemistry,"Solid-phase microextraction is a well-established green solvent free extraction technique with a large number of applications in different fields such as food, forensic, biomedical, and the environment. The present review comprehensively describes the most recent applications mostly reported from 2013 of SPME for the extraction of environmental pollutants including persistent organic pollutants (POPs), pesticides, and emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), in different environmental matrices. This review also covers the last technological developments including the use of novel extraction coatings (MOFs, CNTs, ILs), formats (e.g. TFSE), approaches (e.g. vacuum, cold fiber, and in-tube SPME), and on-site devices. The hyphenation of SPME with other techniques, especially mass spectrometry will be described, as well.

Ultraclean paired sampling for metal analysis in neurodegenerative disorders,Roos P.M.,2019,Journal of Trace Elements in Medicine and Biology,"The causes of neurodegenerative disorders are largely unknown. Environmental factors seem to contribute to neurodegeneration in genetically susceptible individuals. Increasing evidence point towards a key role for environmental exposure in the causation of neurodegenerative disorders and specifically for metal exposure. Alterations of metalloproteins seem to be a common motif in neurodegeneration and enough evidence has now accumulated to designate these disorders as metallopathies. Paired sampling refers to the simultaneous sampling of CSF and blood and by comparing metal concentrations between CSF and blood conclusions about exposure and barrier properties can be drawn. However previous reports on metal concentrations in body fluids in neurodegenerative disorders show a wide variation in results hampering firm conclusions on the role of metals in degeneration of nerve cells. Here we suggest some steps and measures to minimise this variation, most important sampling performed in a cleanroom with filtered air and the use of acid washed perfluoroalkoxy vials. By strict adherence to ultraclean paired sampling technique conclusive results concerning the role of metals in neurodegenerative disorders can be generated. © 2018",Cerebrospinal fluid; ICP-MS; Metallopathies; Metals; Neurodegenerative; Sampling,copper; lead; magnesium; manganese; polypropylene; trace metal; vanadium; zinc; trace element; air quality; blood analysis; blood brain barrier; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; chemical analysis; degenerative disease; environmental factor; human; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; lubrication; lumbar puncture; molecular weight; priority journal; Review; trace metal blood level; analysis; blood; degenerative disease; environmental exposure; mass spectrometry; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Trace Elements,Elsevier GmbH
PFNA and InterTAN intramedullary nailing in elderly patients with femoral intertrochanteric fractures: a Meta analysis,"Yu C., Jiang L.-H., Cai D.-W., Wu J., Qin J.",2019,Zhongguo gu shang = China journal of orthopaedics and traumatology,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of proximal femoral nail antirotation(PFNA) vs InterTAN nail in treating the elderly intertrochanteric femoral fractures. METHODS: Data of the randomized controlled trials(RCTs) about PFNA vs InterTAN for the treatment of the elderly intertrochanteric femoral fractures were searched in as the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMbase, Wanfang, CNKI, CBM and VIP from their establishment to January 2018 for collecting. After study selection, assessment and data extraction conducted by two reviewers independently, meta-analyses were performed by using the RevMan 5.3 sofware. The level of evidence was assessed by using the GRADEpro system. RESULTS: Twelve studies involving 1 015 patients were included. The results of meta, analyses showed that: (1)safety indicator: compared with the InterTAN, PFNA had shorter operation time, and less intraoperative bleeding. But InterTAN had less total postoperative complications and internal fixation failure, but there was no significant difference in the operative incision lengths, fracture healing time and other postoperative complications. (2)efficacy indicator: compared with the InterTAN, the Harris hip score was lower after 3 months, but Harris hip score had no significant difference between the two groups after 6, 12 months. Based on GRADEpro system, all the evidence was at level C and weak recommendation(2C). CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence indicates that PFNA had a similar effect compared with the InterTAN. But InterTAN could provide better stability against rotation and axial pressure effect, can allow patients do functional exercise early such as ambulation to recovery the hip function. It also had less total postoperative complications and internal fixation failure for the poor quality of the original studies and the limited number of studies, a prudent choice is suggested and more high-quality, large-sample studies are need.

Performance Analysis of Flame Retardant 4 Copper Plate Antenna for Lightning Remote Sensing,"Periannan D., Mohamad S.A., Ahmad M.R., Esa M.R.M., Sabri M.H.M., Seah B.Y., Lu G., Yusop N., Ismail M.M., Abdul-Malek Z., Cooray V., Alkahtani A.A., Kadir M.Z.A.A.B.",2019,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,"Lightning remote sensing has been used widely to measure the electromagnetic (EM) fields in various frequencies bands. Circular metal plate capacitive antenna made of iron or aluminium have been used widely for the front-end design of the remote sensing system. The circular metal plates are arranged in parallel and separated by insulators made of Teflon. However, three common problems encountered with the existing setting. First, both metals rust easily and could affect the reading of the EM fields. Second, the insulation Teflon separating the metal plates could become weak conductor during heavy rain and thus distort the EM fields reading. Third, the use of Teflon in between the parallel plates changes the overall permittivity value. In this paper, we propose a cheaper and lighter alternative to iron and aluminium plates by changing to FR4 copper plate. Rectangular FR4 copper plate capacitive antennas with 2 sizes, A4 and A3 have been designed and constructed. The rectangular A3 FR4 copper plate has been found to have similar impedance and capacitance values to the iron-based circular metal plate. Analysis of wave shape and peak amplitude ratio showed similar performance between both antennas. Therefore, we conclude that rectangular A3 FR4 copper plate antenna can be used as replacement for the existing iron- or aluminium-based circular metal plates antenna. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Aluminum; Antennas; Climate change; Copper plating; Iron; Lightning; Polytetrafluoroethylenes; Remote sensing; Aluminium plates; Capacitance values; Front-end design; Parallel plates; Performance analysis; Permittivity values; Plate antennas; Remote sensing system; Plate metal,Institute of Physics Publishing
Occurrence and levels of micropollutants across environmental and engineered compartments in Austria,"Zoboli O., Clara M., Gabriel O., Scheffknecht C., Humer M., Brielmann H., Kulcsar S., Trautvetter H., Kittlaus S., Amann A., Saracevic E., Krampe J., Zessner M.",2019,Journal of Environmental Management,"Occurrence and concentration of a broad spectrum of micropollutants are investigated in Austrian river catchments, namely polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), organotin compounds, perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) and metals. The parallel analysis across multiple environmental and engineered compartments sheds light on the ratio of dissolved and particulate transport and on differences in concentration levels between point and diffuse emission pathways. It is found that some PAHs and organotins are present in rivers, groundwater and bulk deposition at higher concentrations than in municipal wastewater effluents. Among PFAAs and metals, highest concentrations were recorded either in atmospheric deposition or in discharges from wastewater treatment plants. The relevance of the analysis across compartments is best shown by the case of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Despite municipal wastewater effluents being the emission pathway with highest concentrations, this study reveals that not only rivers, but also atmospheric deposition and groundwater sometimes exceed the environmental quality standard for surface waters. Moreover, this work reveals partially counterintuitive patterns. In rivers with treated wastewater discharges, increasing levels of dissolved compounds were measured at rising flow conditions, whereas the opposite would be expected owing to the dilution effect. This might derive from the mobilisation from soil or suspended particulate matter or rather find its explanation in high concentrations in atmospheric deposition. These hypotheses require however being tested through targeted studies. Additional future research includes the analysis of how regional or catchment specific characteristics might alter the relative importance of different emission pathways, and the modelling of emission and river loads to assess their relative contribution to river pollution. © 2018 The Author(s)",Metals; Organotin compounds; Perfuoroalkyl acids; Polybrominated diphenyl ethers; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; River catchments,"2,2',4,4' tetrabromodiphenyl ether; cadmium; copper; ground water; lead; mercury; metal; nickel; organotin compound; perfluoroalkyl acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polyfunctional group; river water; unclassified drug; zinc; atmospheric deposition; catchment; chemical compound; chemical pollutant; concentration (composition); emission; environmental quality; groundwater; metal; PAH; PBDE; river pollution; river water; suspended particulate matter; wastewater; wastewater treatment plant; Article; atmospheric deposition; Austria; catchment; effluent; hydrophobicity; limit of quantitation; micropollutant; molecular weight; pollutant; sludge; suspended particulate matter; environmental monitoring; river; water pollutant; Austria; Austria; Environmental Monitoring; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Academic Press
Spectral mapping methods applied to LiDAR data: Application to fuel type mapping,"Huesca M., Riaño D., Ustin S.L.",2019,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,"Originally developed to classify multispectral and hyperspectral images, spectral mapping methods were used to classify Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to estimate the vertical structure of vegetation for Fuel Type (FT) mapping. Three spectral mapping methods generated spatially comprehensive FT maps for Cabañeros National Park (Spain): (1) Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA), (2) Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), and (3) Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). The Vegetation Vertical Profiles (VVPs) describe the vertical distribution of the vegetation and are used to define each FT endmember in a LiDAR signature library. Two different approaches were used to define the endmembers, one based on the field data collected in 1998 and 1999 (Approach 1) and the other on exploring spatial patterns of the singular FT discriminating factors (Approach 2). The overall accuracy is higher for Approach 2 and with best results when considering a five-FT model rather than a seven-FT model. The agreement with field data of 44% for MESMA and SMA and 40% for SAM is higher than the 38% of the official Cabañeros National Park FTs map. The principal spatial patterns for the different FTs were well captured, demonstrating the value of this novel approach using spectral mapping methods applied to LiDAR data. The error sources included the time gap between field data and LiDAR acquisition, the steep topography in parts of the study site, and the low LiDAR point density among others. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Fuel types; LiDAR; Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis; Spectral angle mapper; Spectral mixture analysis; Vegetation vertical profile; Wildfires,data set; image analysis; lidar; mapping method; spatiotemporal analysis; spectral analysis; vegetation mapping; Cabaneros National Park; Castilla-La Mancha; Spain,Elsevier B.V.
Perfluoropolymer/molecular sieve mixed-matrix membranes,"Golemme G., Santaniello A.",2019,Membranes,"Despite the outstanding chemical, thermal and transport properties of amorphous and glassy perfluorinated polymers, only few works exist on the preparation and transport properties of perfluoropolymer/molecular sieves mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs), probably because of their poor compatibility. In this review, the compatibilization of ceramic molecular sieves with perfluorinated matrices is considered first, examining the effect of the surface treatment on the gas transport properties of the filler. Then the preparation of the defect-free hybrid membranes and their gas separation capabilities are described. Finally, recent modelling of the gas transport properties of the perfluoropolymer MMMs is reviewed. The systematic use of molecular sieves of different size and shape, either permeable or impermeable, and the calculation of the bulk transport properties of the molecular sieves-i.e., the unrestricted diffusion and permeability-allow to understand the nature of the physical phenomena at work in the MMMs, that is the larger the perfluoropolymer fractional free volume at the interface, and restricted diffusion at the molecular sieves. This knowledge led to the formulation of a new four-phase approach for the modelling of gas transport. The four-phase approach was implemented in the frame of the Maxwell model and also for the finite element simulation. The four-phase approach is a convenient representation of the transport in MMMs when more than one single interfacial effect is present. © 2019 by the authors.

Removal of poly- and per-fluoroalkyl substances from aqueous systems by nano-enabled water treatment strategies,"Saleh N.B., Khalid A., Tian Y., Ayres C., Sabaraya I.V., Pietari J., Hanigan D., Chowdhury I., Apul O.G.",2019,Environmental Science: Water Research and Technology,"Exceptional properties at the nano-scale, if appropriately harnessed, will lead to innovations in water treatment. Nanomaterials can enable treatment processes with accelerated reaction kinetics, self-healing or self-regeneration abilities, and a high degree of selectivity for targeted pollutant removal. These materials can also introduce new pathways for the removal of contaminants that are challenging to degrade employing traditional techniques. One such class of contaminants is poly- and per-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are widely detected in waterways of the U.S. and drinking water supplies. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has listed two PFAS (i.e., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid or PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid or PFOA) in the Contaminant Candidate List and recently has revised the lifetime health advisories. PFAS molecules are persistent in the environment over long periods because they are not photolyzed or biodegraded. Current mitigation technologies mostly depend on non-destructive phase transfer processes (e.g., adsorption, filtration, or ion exchange) which results in a concentrated waste stream. Few destructive mitigation methods transform PFAS by cleaving C-C bonds but it is not clear if the transformation products (e.g., shorter chain PFAS) are less toxic or less persistent. Thus, the central challenge for PFAS transformation lies in cleaving the strong C-F bonds. Nanomaterials can enable treatment options by providing high-energy reaction pathways; e.g., electrolysis, thermolysis, or photolysis. This perspective aims to present a critical review on reported PFAS removal/destruction techniques, provide molecular-level insights into possible removal/destruction pathways, and propose potential nano-enabled remediation options for these persistent contaminants. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Contamination; Environmental Protection Agency; Ion exchange; Nanostructured materials; Nanotechnology; Photolysis; Potable water; Reaction kinetics; Water supply; Water treatment; Mitigation methods; Molecular-level insights; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Phase transfer process; Reaction pathways; Traditional techniques; Transformation products; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Lead removal (water treatment); chemical bonding; nanotechnology; photolysis; pollutant removal; reaction kinetics; remediation; water treatment; United States,Royal Society of Chemistry
The state of POPs in Ghana- A review on persistent organic pollutants: Environmental and human exposure,"Bruce-Vanderpuije P., Megson D., Reiner E.J., Bradley L., Adu-Kumi S., Gardella J.A., Jr.",2019,Environmental Pollution,"Ghana is one of the top pesticide users and highest persistent organic pollutant (POP) emitters in sub-saharan Africa. Despite recent increases in published data, there is limited information on how POP concentrations have changed, post ratification of the Stockholm Convention. As a result, this review aims to address these knowledge gaps by collating available data that reported POPs in Ghanaian environmental matrices, identify spatial and temporal trends, and establish potential health risks. It is worth noting that Ghana has not developed its own regulatory standards for POPs, but adapts United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) standards. Results obtained showed concentrations in excess of USEPA regulatory standards for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl sulphonates (PFASs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) in water, polychlorinated and polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs) in e-waste soils, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in aquatic organisms and dairy products. The published studies do not cover major regions nationwide. The inconsistency in methods and analytes measured, along with data scarcity in some regions, makes it challenging to identify temporal trends. However, the data did indicate decreasing concentrations of some legacy POPs in soil/sediment and aquatic organisms, with increasing concentrations of some POPs in water, fish, fruits and vegetables. Studies that performed health risks assessments were limited although the data indicated risks to e-waste workers, some farmers and vulnerable sub-populations. This review identified potential human health risks from POPs in the Ghanaian environment and the need for more consistent and widespread monitoring program. This paper provides a critical review of studies of POPs in Ghana which can be used as a reference for all of Africa, as well as other developing countries, for compliance with the requirements for POPs monitoring in the e-waste, food and environmental sectors to inform the mitigation of health risks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Africa; Environment; Ghana; Human health; Persistent organic pollutants,"Aquatic organisms; Dairies; Developing countries; Electronic Waste; Environmental Protection Agency; Health; Health risks; Population statistics; Wastes; Africa; Environment; Ghana; Human health; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Organic pollutants; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethane; environmental, industrial and domestic chemicals; oil; perfluoroalkyl sulphonate; polybrominated dibenzo 4 dioxin; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated dibenzo 4 dioxin; polyfluoroalkyl sulphonate; unclassified drug; water; diphenyl ether derivative; fresh water; pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; concentration (composition); environmental impact; health risk; persistent organic pollutant; pollution exposure; spatiotemporal analysis; trend analysis; agricultural worker; aquatic species; blood; breast milk; cereal; cocoa bean; controlled study; cowpea; dairy product; data analysis; data scarcity; e-waste soil; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; fish; fruit; Ghana; government; health hazard; honey; human; knowledge; maize; meat; nonhuman; occupational exposure; persistent organic pollutant; plastic resin pellet; practice gap; Review; sediment; serum; soil; spatial analysis; standard; temporal analysis; trend study; vegetable; waste; analysis; animal; chemistry; e-waste; pollutant; procedures; Ghana; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Dairy Products; Electronic Waste; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Fresh Water; Ghana; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Pesticides; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Soil",Elsevier Ltd

Flux tope analysis: Studying the coordination of reaction directions in metabolic networks,"Gerstl M.P., Müller S., Regensburger G., Zanghellini J.",2019,Bioinformatics,"Motivation Elementary flux mode (EFM) analysis allows an unbiased description of metabolic networks in terms of minimal pathways (involving a minimal set of reactions). To date, the enumeration of EFMs is impracticable in genome-scale metabolic models. In a complementary approach, we introduce the concept of a flux tope (FT), involving a maximal set of reactions (with fixed directions), which allows one to study the coordination of reaction directions in metabolic networks and opens a new way for EFM enumeration. Results A FT is a (nontrivial) subset of the flux cone specified by fixing the directions of all reversible reactions. In a consistent metabolic network (without unused reactions), every FT contains a ' €' maximal pathway', carrying flux in all reactions. This decomposition of the flux cone into FTs allows the enumeration of EFMs (of individual FTs) without increasing the problem dimension by reaction splitting. To develop a mathematical framework for FT analysis, we build on the concepts of sign vectors and hyperplane arrangements. Thereby, we observe that FT analysis can be applied also to flux optimization problems involving additional (inhomogeneous) linear constraints. For the enumeration of FTs, we adapt the reverse search algorithm and provide an efficient implementation. We demonstrate that (biomass-optimal) FTs can be enumerated in genome-scale metabolic models of B.cuenoti and E.coli, and we use FTs to enumerate EFMs in models of M.genitalium and B.cuenoti.

Heavy metal content in plastic children toys,"Pehlic E., Sapcanin A., Srabovic M., Nuhanovic M., Nanic H., Dzaferovic A.",2019,Journal of Environmental Protection and Ecology,"In the children toys market, manufacturers are struggling to make the most profits, offering different products, some of which are of questionable quality and pose a potential danger to the health of children. The aim of the paper was to determine the content of heavy metals: cadmium, lead, zinc, iron and cobalt in coloured plastic toys. Another aim was to compare the concentration of these heavy metals in toys manufactured in China and the EU. Samples were prepared by wet digestion in the microwave oven Anton Paar Multiwave 3000. The sample was discharged in a mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide in Teflon vessels in a ratio of 1 ml H2 O2 and 6 ml HNO3. The measurement was performed by atomic absorption spectrometry by flame technique, on the instrument ‘Perkin Elmer’ Analyst-800 with Zeeman correction. Six different types of children toys were analysed. The largest measured concentration for Cd was in sample 1 and it was 0.9 μg/kg, while in samples 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, Cd concentrations were below instrument detection for said heavy metal. The Pb content in all samples was below the limit of detection of flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The highest concentration of Co was in sample number 3 and it amounted to 5.6 μg/kg while in the sample 2 the value was 3.5 μg/kg. The content of Zn in sample 2 was 213.7 μg/kg, while the other values were slightly lower. The lowest Fe concentration value was in sample number 1 from 6.8 μg/ kg and the highest 617.7 μg/kg in the sample 5. The concentrations of all the analysed heavy metals in the scabbard parts from the toy for children were within the permissible concentration limits that have been prescribed by Directive 2009/48/EC on the safety of toys, and therefore these toys do not pose a risk to children health. Also, there were no major rejections of heavy metal concentrations in children toys, regardless of the origin of production (China or the EU). © 2019, Scibulcom Ltd..

Proximal femoral nail antirotation versus hemiarthroplasty in treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fracture in older adults: A meta-analysis,"Ouyang J.F., Li B.Q., Xuan W.H., Wang S.W.",2019,Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research,"BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment is an accepted method for intertrochanteric fractures. For the older adults accompanied by severe osteoporosis and other diseases, how to treat intertrochanteric fractures still remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of proximal femoral nail antirotation versus hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in older adults through meta-analysis. METHODS: According to the Cochrane system evaluation, a computer-based retrieval of Medline, PubMed, SPINGER, John Wiley, Science Direct, EBSCO, CNKI, WanFang, and VIP databases between 2008 and 2018 was performed. The keywords were “proximal femoral nail antirotation or PFNA, hemiarthroplasty, unstable intertrochanteric fractures” in English and Chinese, respectively. The literate was screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then quality evaluation was conducted. Meta-analysis was undergone on the Rev-Man 5.1 software. RUSULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Thirteen clinical trials were included, involving 1 223 patients, and including 6 randomized controlled trials. (2) Meta-analysis results showed that the operation time in the proximal femoral nail antirotation group was shorter [MD=-6.54, 95%Cl (-12.81, -0.21), P < 0.01], intraoperative blood loss was lower [MD=-130.83, 95%CI (-190.99, -70.68), P < 0.01], and the incidence of implant complications was higher [RR=2.32, 95%Cl (1.12, 4.84), P < 0.01] compared with the hemiarthroplasty group. (3) In the hemiarthroplasty group, the ambulation time was earlier [MD=18.06, 95%CI (10.3±25.79), P < 0.000 1], and the Harris scores were increased [MD=-8.19, 95%Cl (-9.45, -6.93), P < 0.01] compared with the proximal femoral nail antirotation group. (4) There was no significant difference in the postoperative complications, hospitalization time or excellent and good rate in Harris scores between two groups (P > 0.05). (5) In summary, the operation time in the proximal femoral nail antirotation group is shorter and the amount of bleeding was less than those in the hemiarthroplasty group, but the incidence of implant complications is higher than that in the hemiarthroplasty group. The hemiarthroplasty group has an advantage in postoperative Harris score and postoperative loading time. © 2019, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

"Monitoring for particulates, airborne metals, and explosives in a remote environment","Lee J., Lindsay M.",2019,AQM 2019 - Air Quality Measurement Methods and Technology Conference 2019,"The Vieques Naval Training Range (VNTR) was used for military training by the United States and allied nations from the early 1940s until 2003. The Live Impact Area (LIA) on VNTR covers roughly 400 acres and was used for air-to-ground ordnance, artillery, and individually served weapons training. When the VNTR was decommissioned in 2003, the Navy began removal and disposal of munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) under both a time critical and non-time critical removal action (TCRA and NTCRA) in accordance with CERCLA guidance. Air monitoring was performed between 2005 – 2013 at remote locations on the LIA and elsewhere inside the VNTR to evaluate any potential impact on air quality associated with munitions removal. During that time, air quality as represented by PM10, was monitored using beta attenuation monitors that were configured with a Teflon tape to allow subsequent analysis for metals and explosives residues. Due to the remote location with limited infrastructure, these systems were powered with solar and batteries. The monitoring included over 1,400 air samples collected during more than 160 detonation events. No explosives were detected during any of the air monitoring events. There were no detections of mercury, lead, cadmium, tin, or phosphorus. The naturally occurring metals iron, nickel, copper, chromium, and arsenic were detected at concentrations well below health-based standards. In 2016, EPA equivalent monitors for PM10, PM2.5, and CO using municipal power grid service were installed in nearby populated areas for follow-on monitoring. After the destruction caused by Hurricane Maria, there was a need to transition back to low power systems due to the absence of reliable, on-island electrical power. Low power systems that do not require a climate-controlled environment were implemented for use in response to ongoing power grid reliability issues. These systems were installed in 2018 to monitor for PM10, PM2.5, and CO at three locations and metals and explosives at one of the three locations. The air monitoring program at the VNTR illustrates how to adapt to changing circumstances while still achieving program objectives, as detailed in this paper. © 2019 Air and Waste Management Association.

Accurate determination of major elements of alloys using low power XRF spectrometer,Kuniya J.,2019,Bunseki Kagaku,"An accurate determination procedure of major elements of metal alloy was studied by a home-made compact X-ray fluorescence (XRF) instrument. This XRF instrument was composed with a low-power X-ray tube, silicon drift detector and home-made small volume of liquid flow cell. The flow cell has volume of 0.2 mL and a window covered with 12 micron polypropylene film. A metallic alloy of 0.2 g was dissolved with a small portion of acidic reagent in a Teflon bottle, and then diluted to sample solution of 10 mL. A portion of the sample solution and internal element solution were mixed by weight and prepared to a sample solution of about 5 mL. We then flowed about 2 mL of this sample solution to the XRF instrument. All spectra of the sample solution were obtained at 3 W of the X-ray tube power output and a 60 sec accumulation time. Major elements of metallic alloy were determined from gross counts or net counts using an internal standard correction method. The recovered weight, that is, the sum weight of the major elements determined by the procedure described above for three kind of iron alloy and two kind of brass, were exactly matched with actually dissolved alloy weight. Concretely, value which was divided by the actually dissolved alloy weight of recovered weight, was obtained in the range of 99.9% to 103.0%. The statistical error was under 2 percent in all cases. Additionally, peak overlapping effects on the accuracy of the elemental determination values for neodymium magnet, which was contained with four rare earth elements was discussed. From the experiment, elemental determination analysis in solution was easily and quickly able to carried out by this compact XRF instrument with liquid flow cell. So that, it is concluded that this method by this XRF instrument with liquid flow cell is effective for the accurate determination of the major element analysis of a metal alloy. © 2019 The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry.",Accurate quantitative analysis; Fixed liquid flow cell; Major element determination; Small power X-ray tube; X-ray fluorescence spectrometry,,Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry
Do Women have Adequate Knowledge about Pelvic Floor Dysfunctions? A Systematic Review,"Fante J.F., Silva T.D., Mateus-Vasconcelos E.C.L., Ferreira C.H.J., Brito L.G.O.",2019,Revista Brasileira de Ginecologia e Obstetricia,"Objective  We sought to investigate whether women present adequate knowledge of the main pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) (urinary incontinence - UI, fecal incontinence - FI, and pelvic organ prolapse - POP). Data sources  A systematic review was performed in the MEDLINE, PEDro, CENTRAL, and Cochrane databases for publications from inception to April 2018. Selection of studies  A total of 3,125 studies were reviewed. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of primary outcomes and the diversity of instruments for measuring knowledge. The quality of the articles included in the analysis was evaluated with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) adapted for cross-sectional studies. Data collection  Two authors performed data extraction into a standardized spreadsheet. Data synthesis  Nineteen studies were included, comprising 11,512 women. About the methodological quality (NOS), most of the studies (n = 11) presented a total score of 6 out of 10. Validated questionnaires and designed pilot-tested forms were the most frequently used ways of assessing knowledge. Some studies were stratified by race, age, or group minorities. The most used questionnaire was the prolapse and incontinence knowledge questionnaire (PIKQ) (n = 5). Knowledge and/or awareness regarding PFD was low to moderate among the studies. Urinary incontinence was the most prevalent PFD investigated, and the most important risk factors associated with the lack of knowledge of the pelvic floor were: African-American ethnicity (n = 3), low educational level (n = 4), low access to information (n = 5) and socioeconomic status (n = 3). Conclusion  Most women have a gap in the knowledge of pelvic floor muscle dysfunctions, do not understand their treatment options, and are not able to identify risk factors for these disorders. © 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Differential metabolism of medium-chain fatty acids in differentiated human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes,"Sonnay S., Chakrabarti A., Thevenet J., Wiederkehr A., Christinat N., Masoodi M.",2019,Frontiers in Physiology,"Medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diets increase ketone bodies, which are believed to act as alternative energy substrates in the injured brain. Octanoic (C8:0) and decanoic (C10:0) acids, which produce ketone bodies through β-oxidation, are used as part of MCT ketogenic diets. Although the ketogenic role of MCT is well-established, it remains unclear how the network metabolism underlying β-oxidation of these medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) differ. We aim to elucidate basal β-oxidation of these commonly used MCFA at the cellular level. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC) astrocytes were incubated with [U-13C]-C8:0 or [U-13C]-C10:0, and the fractional enrichments (FE) of the derivatives were used for metabolic flux analysis. Data indicate higher extracellular concentrations and faster secretion rates of β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc) with C8:0 than C10:0, and an important contribution from unlabeled substrates. Flux analysis indicates opposite direction of metabolic flux between the MCFA intermediates C6:0 and C8:0, with an important contribution of unlabeled sources to the elongation in the C10:0 condition, suggesting different β-oxidation pathways. Finally, larger intracellular glutathione concentrations and secretions of 3-OH-C10:0 and C6:0 were measured in C10:0-treated astrocytes. These findings reveal MCFA-specific ketogenic properties. Our results provide insights into designing different MCT-based ketogenic diets to target specific health benefits. © 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

Single- versus double-integrated screws in intramedullary nailing systems for surgical management of extracapsular hip fractures in the elderly: A systematic review,"Cipollaro L., Aicale R., Maccauro G., Maffulli N.",2019,Journal of Biological Regulators and Homeostatic Agents,"Approximately 50% of all hip fractures are extracapsular and typically treated with extramedullary or intramedullary fixation. Modern intramedullary nails used for internal fixation of extracapsular fractures are generally cephalomedullary nails secured by at least one cephalic screw. Different designs have been developed, varying in length, diameter, neck shaft angle, number of cephalic screws or blades, ability to slide and/or compress, ability to control rotation, construction materials and insertion-point. Articles published in all languages up to January 2019, are listed in PubMed and Scopus electronic databases about the association between the number of cephalic screws and the rate of complications and functional outcome. Twenty articles were included following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Sliding hip screws (SHS) were the standard of care for hip fractures from the 1950s to the 1990s, but presently intramedullary nails are more commonly used. There has been a more than 20-fold relative increase in the utilization of intramedullary nails since 1999. With the emergence of value-based healthcare, there is a growing interest of how best to provide high-quality care in a clinical and cost-effective manner, acknowledging limited healthcare budgets. The present systematic review assessed the long-term outcomes of the most commonly used nails using double cephalic screws compared with single screw devices in patients with unstable intertrochanteric fractures. The development of new technologies may allow a lower incidence of complications, a reduction in operative time and a lower intraoperative blood loss. © by BIOLIFE, s.a.s.",Hip fracture; Intertan; Nail; Pfna; Proximal femoral fracture; Screws,"Article; clinical practice; device comparison; femur intertrochanteric fracture; hip fracture; human; intramedullary nailing; long term care; meta analysis; operation duration; systematic review; bone screw; hip fracture; treatment outcome; Bone Screws; Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary; Hip Fractures; Humans; Treatment Outcome",Biolife s.a.s.
Analysis of antibiotic resistance genes fate and its drivers during anaerobic digestion of animal manure [畜禽粪便厌氧发酵过程抗生素抗性基因归趋及驱动因子分析],"Zhi S., Zhou J., Zhao R., Yang F., Zhang K.",2019,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been considered as an emerging pollutant. The occurrence of ARGs is mainly due to the overuse of antibiotics. China is the largest producer and consumer of antibiotics in the world, and it was estimated that about 162 000 t of antibiotics were used in China in 2013, among which 52% was used for animal breeding. However, after used, 30%-90% of these veterinary antibiotics were excreted with feces and urine for partially metabolized by animal body. Therefore, animal manure has been considered as an important reservoir of antibiotic residues and ARGs. If not treated effectively, ARGs can enter into other environmental mediums with land application. And ARGs can eventually enter into the human food chain which may endanger the public safety. Anaerobic digestion is a promising technology which can convert the organic matters to biogas and organic fertilizers. So it is widely used for animal manure disposal in different animal farms. Therefore, the variation of ARGs in anaerobic digestion system has big significance for reducing the risk of ARGs growth and transmission. The paper firstly showed that ARGs were ubiquitous in manure, water, soil, food and even in the air, on the basis of analyzing ARGs levels in different environmental mediums. About the detecting methods of ARGs, the main detecting methods contained PCR, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), high-throughput quantitative PCR and metagenomic technique, among which metagenomic technique was the most promising technology for comprehensive analyzing of ARGs in different types. About the variation of ARGs and its driving factors during anaerobic digestion, the paper analyzed the relating literatures at home and abroad. The results showed that the microbial community composition was the main driving factor of ARGs variation, which was due to the variation of the potential host microbes carrying ARGs during anaerobic digestion. Although many studies had investigated the ARGs and their potential hosts through the statistical method, the further confirmation of the real hosts for ARGs was also need. The determination of ARGs host microbes was the difficulty parts for the future research. Antibiotic residues and heavy metals were also the important driving factors for ARGs variation, so it is important to remove the antibiotic residues and heavy metals thoroughly to reduce the environmental risk of ARGs pollution. The mobile genetic elements played a key role in the horizontal transmission of ARGs, and they could be considered as some indicators for ARGs variation. On the whole, all the factors in anaerobic digestion system could directly or indirectly impact the ARGs variation. The operating parameters were the precondition for the whole system. Under the designed operating parameters, the microbial communities interacted with other physicochemical parameters in the anaerobic digestion system. The microbial communities affected the ARGs transmission by mobile genetic elements. Therefore, it was the research emphasis for future work to control ARGs by comprehensive regulation of different factors of anaerobic digestion system. The paper will provide some theoretical information for researchers about the variation, transmission and driving factors of ARGs in anaerobic digestion system with animal manure. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Removal of pharmaceutical contaminants in wastewater using nanomaterials: A comprehensive review,"Chauhan A., Sillu D., Agnihotri S.",2019,Current Drug Metabolism,"Background: The limitless presence of pharmaceutical contaminants in discharged wastewater has emerged as a threat to aquatic species and humans. Their presence in drinking water has although raised substantial concerns, very little is known about the fate and ecological impacts of these pollutants. As a result, these pollutants are inevitably introduced to our food chain at trace concentrations. Unfortunately, the conventional wastewater treatment techniques are unable to treat pharmaceuticals completely with practical limitations. The focus has now been shifted towards nanotechnology for the successful remediation of these persistent pollutants. Thus, the current review specifically focuses on providing readers brief yet sharp insights into applications of various nanomaterials for the removal of pharmaceutical contaminants. Methods: An exhaustive collection of bibliographic database was done with articles having high impact and citations in relevant research domains. An in-depth analysis of screened papers was done through standard tools. Studies were categorized according to the use of nanoscale materials as nano-adsorbents (graphene, carbon nanotubes), nanophotocatalysts (metal, metal oxide), nano-filtration, and ozonation for promising alternative technologies for the efficient removal of recalcitrant contaminants. Results: A total of 365 research articles were selected. The contemporary advancements in the field of nanomaterials for drinking and wastewater treatment have been thoroughly analyzed along with their future perspectives. Conclusion: The recommendations provided in this article will be useful to adopt novel strategies for on-site removal of the emerging contaminants in pharmaceutical effluents and related industries. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers",Carbon nanotubes; Emerging pollutants; Graphene; Immobilization; Nano adsorbents; Nanocomposites; Photocatalysis,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; activated carbon; amoxicillin; ampicillin; atrazine; carbon nanotube; ciprofloxacin; clarithromycin; clofibric acid; diclofenac; enrofloxacin; erythromycin; graphene oxide; ibuprofen; iron oxide; marbofloxacin; methotrexate; metronidazole; nanocomposite; nanomaterial; norfloxacin; paracetamol; phenazopyridine; resorcinol; sulfachlorpyridazine; sulfamethoxazole; titanium dioxide; unindexed drug; zeolite; zinc oxide; graphite; adsorption; bioremediation; chemical bond; chemical interaction; drug contamination; environmental factor; human; image analysis; irradiation; municipal wastewater; nanofiltration; nonhuman; ozonation; photocatalysis; photosensitivity; Review; scanning electron microscopy; ultraviolet radiation; waste component removal; waste water; waste water management; water contamination; water pollutant; zeta potential; isolation and purification; nanotechnology; pollutant; procedures; waste water; water management; water pollutant; Environmental Pollutants; Graphite; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Nanotubes, Carbon; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Bentham Science Publishers
Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF 6 ) versus Perfluoropropane (C 3 F 8 ) in the Intraoperative Management of Macular Holes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Hecht I., Mimouni M., Blumenthal E.Z., Barak Y., Charles S.",2019,Journal of Ophthalmology,"Purpose. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify and review studies comparing SF to C3F8 as a tamponade agent in the intraoperative management of macular holes. Methods. Publications up to October 2018 that focused on macular hole surgery in terms of primary closure, complications, and clinical outcomes were included. Forest plots were created using a weighted summary of proportion meta-analysis. Analysis was performed separately for SF and C3F8. A random effects model was used, and corresponding I2 heterogeneity estimates were calculated. Results. Nine pertinent publications studying a total of 4,715 patients were identified in 2000 to 2017, including two randomized studies (n=206), two prospective studies (n=170), and five retrospective or registry-based studies. Similar rates of closure between SF and C3F8 were reported in eight out of nine studies, regardless of subgroup analyses. All studies reporting visual outcomes showed similar results when comparing SF to C3F8 at one to six months of follow-up. Neither agent was clearly associated with increased risk of ocular hypertension, cataract formation, or other adverse events. Meta-analytic pooling of the closure rates in the SF group resulted in 91.73% (95% confidence interval: 88.40 to 94.55, I2: 38.03%), and for C3F8, the closure rate was 88.36% (95% confidence interval: 85.88 to 90.63, I2: 0.0%). Conclusions. Both SF and C3F8 appear to have achieved similar visual outcomes and primary closure rates and neither was associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Considering the more rapid visual recovery with SF, there appears to be no evidence to support C3F8 as the tamponade agent of choice for macular hole surgery. © 2019 Idan Hecht et al.",,,Hindawi Limited
Tranexamic acid can reduce blood loss in patients undergoing intertrochanteric fracture surgery A meta-analysis,"Jiang W., Shang L.",2019,Medicine (United States),"Background: This meta-analysis aimed to assess whether administration tranexamic acid (TXA) could reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients undergoing intertrochanteric fracture surgery. Methods: We performed an electronic search of PubMed (1950-October 2018), EMBASE (1974-October 2018), the Cochrane Library (October 2018 Issue 3), the Google database (1950-October 2018), and the Chinese Wanfang database (1950-October 2018). Studies were included in accordance with Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Setting (PICOS) including criteria. Intertrochanteric fracture patients prepared for surgery were selected. Administration with TXA and the placebo or no interventions were considered as an intervention and comparators, respectively. Measures related to total blood loss, blood loss in drainage, hemoglobin on postoperative day were analyzed. A fixed/random-effects model was used according to the heterogeneity assessed by the I2 statistic. Data analysis was performed using Stata 12.0 software. Results:A total of five RCTs with 584 patients (TXA group=289, control group=298) were included in the meta-analysis. Based on the results, administration of TXA was associated with a reduction in total blood loss, blood loss in drainage, need for transfusion, length of hospital stay, and occurrence of hematoma (P<.05). Administration of TXA increased the hemoglobin level at 3 days after surgery (P<.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the occurrence of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or infection (P>.05). Conclusion: Administration of TXA is associated with reduced total blood loss, postoperative hemoglobin decline, and transfusion requirements in patients with intertrochanteric fractures. Additional high-quality RCTs should be conducted in the future.

Thermal Compatibility between Perfluoroisobutyronitrile-CO2 Gas Mixture with Copper and Aluminum Switchgear,"Li Y., Zhang X., Zhang J., Chen Q., Li Y., Xiao S., Cui Z., Tang J.",2019,IEEE Access,"Perfluoroisobutyronitrile (C4F7N) has received extensive attention over the past three years as an environmental friendly gas insulating medium. At present, there are few studies on the compatibility of C4F7N with metal materials used in the electrical equipment. In this paper, we constructed a gas-solid interfacial reaction platform and carried out aging tests for C4F7N-CO2 gas mixture at different temperatures. The composition of the gas mixture and the surface morphology and the elemental composition of copper, aluminum were explored. The interaction mechanism between C4F7N-CO2 gas mixture and metal surface was also analyzed. It was found that C4F7N-CO2 gas mixture has better compatibility with aluminum than copper. The reaction between C4F7N-CO2 gas mixture and heated copper at 220 °C produces the gaseous by-product C3F6. The surface color of copper deepens and the corrosive degree increases with temperature, while the interaction between C4F7N and heated aluminum does not cause gas decomposition and metal corrosion. In general, the thermal stability of C4F7N-CO2 gas mixture associated with heated copper and aluminum is inferior to that of SF6 © 2019 IEEE.",aluminum; C4F7N-CO2; copper; SF6 alternative gas; thermal compatibility,Aluminum; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum corrosion; Carbon dioxide; Copper; Copper corrosion; Gas mixtures; Morphology; SF6 insulation; Sulfur hexafluoride; Surface morphology; Testing; Thermodynamic stability; C4F7N-CO2; Electrical equipment; Elemental compositions; Environmental-friendly; Gas decomposition; Interaction mechanisms; SF6-alternative; Thermal compatibility; Gases,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.

Exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances during fetal life and pubertal development in boys and girls from the Danish national birth cohort,"Ernst A., Brix N., Lauridsen L.L.B., Olsen J., Parner E.T., Liew Z., Olsen L.H., Ramlau-Hansen C.H.",2019,Environmental Health Perspectives,"BACKGROUND: It remains unsettled whether prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) affects human reproductive health through potential endocrine disruption. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to explore the associations between prenatal exposure to several PFASs and various aspects of pubertal development in boys and girls. METHODS: We studied two samples (n=722 and 445) from the Puberty Cohort, nested within the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), measuring PFAS in maternal plasma from early gestation. Data on pubertal development were collected biannually from the age of 11 y until full maturation, using web-based questionnaires. Outcomes were age at menarche, voice break, first ejaculation, and Tanner stages 2 to 5 for pubic hair, breast, genital development, and a combined puberty indicator. A regression model for censored data was used to estimate mean difference (months) in age at achieving the pubertal outcomes across tertiles of PFAS concentrations and with a doubling of PFAS concentrations (continuous). For perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), a meta-analysis was used to provide a weighted average of the point estimates from samples 1 and 2. RESULTS: Overall, prenatal exposure to PFOS, perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluoroheptane sulfonate (PFHpS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PDFA) (girls) and PFHxS and PFHpS (boys) was associated with lower mean age at puberty marker onset. PFDA and PFNA exposure was associated with higher mean age at onset of puberty in boys. Nonmonotonic associations in girls (PFOS, PFHpS, PFDA) and boys (PFDA, PFNA) were observed, showing larger mean age differences for the combined puberty indicator in the middle tertile [girls: PFOS: -3:73 mo, 95% confidence interval (CI): -6:59, -0:87; PFHpS: -4:92 mo, 95% CI: -11:68, 1.85; PFDA: -3:60 mo, 95% CI: -9:03, 1.83; and boys: PFNA: 4.45 mo, 95% CI: -1:30, 10.21; PFDA: 4.59 mo, 95% CI: -0:93, 10.11] than in the highest tertile with the lowest as reference. CONCLUSIONS: Our population-based cohort study suggests sex-specific associations of altered pubertal development with prenatal exposure to PFASs.

Partitioning of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances from soil to groundwater within aqueous film-forming foam source zones,"Hunter Anderson R., Adamson D.T., Stroo H.F.",2019,Journal of Contaminant Hydrology,"Metadata from on-going site investigations at U.S. Air Force sites impacted by Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF) were used to evaluate primary factors that affect transport of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) within source zones. Soil-to-groundwater ratios (γ Soil-GW ) were calculated for each site and PFAS as an empirical transport metric and regressed against select soil chemical and physical properties, as well as relevant interactions thereof, using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Total organic carbon and percent total clay content were significant covariates and best fit log-transformed γ Soil-GW with a parallel lines model. Regression parameters were used to derive apparent K OC estimates for 15 perfluoroalkyl acids, perfluorooctane sulfonamide, and the 6:2 and 8:2 fluorotelomer sulfonates, which were bimodal where significant differences were primarily observed between PFAS with fewer than 8 perfluorinated carbons (including perfluorooctoanoic acid; PFOA) and those with 8 or more (including perfluorooctane sulfonate; PFOS). Surprisingly, clay content was observed with a negative slope (i.e., γ Soil-GW decreased with increasing clay content), which may reflect greater retardation at more permeable sites due to air-water interfacial partitioning. Further analysis demonstrated that γ Soil-GW is also affected by the degree of flushing in a way that suggests mass transfer (as opposed to hysteretic desorption) primarily controls mass discharge at poorly flushed sites. Overall, this meta-analysis demonstrates that PFAS retention in soil is significant, but depends on a combination of fundamental partitioning mechanisms that may not be predictable in all cases based on transport models that assume an equilibrium condition. © 2018",Equilibrium; PFAS; Soil properties; Sorption,"Air; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Groundwater; Mass transfer; Organic carbon; Phase equilibria; Regression analysis; Soils; Sorption; Sulfur compounds; Analysis of covariances; Aqueous film forming foams; Chemical and physical properties; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Perfluorooctane sulfonamide; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; PFAS; Soil property; Chemical analysis; fluorotelomer sulfonate; ground water; n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetic acid; organic carbon; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl carboxylate; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorooctane sulfonamide; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; polyperfluoroalkyl substance; fluorocarbon; water; aqueous solution; groundwater pollution; organohalogen; partitioning; pollutant source; pollutant transport; soil property; sorption; anion exchange; aqueous solution; concentration (parameter); controlled study; desorption; hydrophobicity; phase partitioning; physical chemistry; priority journal; soil acidity; soil chemistry; soil pollution; static electricity; meta analysis; soil; water pollutant; Fluorocarbons; Groundwater; Soil; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier B.V.
Analysis of benzodiazepines for drug-facilitated assaults and abuse settings (urine),"Drummer O.H., Di Rago M., Gerostamoulos D.",2019,Methods in Molecular Biology,"An overview of the detection of benzodiazepines and their respective metabolites and target analytes in urine by LC-MS/MS is described. This overview shows substantial differences in the approach to detection using this technique including optional use of β-glucuronidase to hydrolyze conjugates present in urine. There are also significant variations in the extraction method employed from the use of direct injection, liquid-liquid extraction to solid-phase extraction options, with little apparent difference in limits of detection. Chromatography was largely based on the use of C18-bonded columns; however both C8- and phenyl-bonded columns were used to affect separation. Modern-day tandem mass spectrometers are capable of exceptional sensitivity enabling detection of sub-nanogram per milliliter amounts in urine, which provide for longer detection times in the urine of suspected drug-facilitated assaults.

Current state and challenges of full-scale membrane bioreactor applications: A critical review,"Xiao K., Liang S., Wang X., Chen C., Huang X.",2019,Bioresource Technology,"Membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology for wastewater treatment has been developed for over three decades. Our latest survey shows that MBR applications for wastewater treatment are still in rapid growth today. This review summarizes the pros, cons and progress in full-scale MBR applications. Critical statistics on the capital cost, operating cost, footprint, energy consumption and chemical consumption of full-scale MBRs are provided, and are compared to those of conventional activated sludge (CAS) processes with/without tertiary treatment. The efficiencies in full-scale treatment of ordinary pollutants (C, N and P), pathogens (bacteria and viruses) and emerging pollutants (e.g., trace organic pollutants) are reviewed. The long-term operation stability of full-scale MBRs is also discussed with several examples provided, with special attention placed on the seasonal variation of membrane fouling.

Catalytic convertion of Al-MCM-41-ceramic on hidrocarbon (C8 - C12) liquid fuel synthesis from polypropylene plastic waste,"Juwono H., Fauziah L., Uyun I.Q., Alfian R., Suprapto, Ni'Mah Y.L., Ulfin I.",2018,AIP Conference Proceedings,"Hydrocarbon liquid fuel (C8-C12) from poly propylene plastic waste has been successfully synthesized by catalytic conversion using Al-MCM-41 as catalyst. The Al-MCM-41 was characterized using SAXRD. Morphology of Al-MCM-41 surface was analyzed using TEM. The metals content were measured using XPS. The performance of Al-MCM-41 to adsorb and desorb nitrogen was monitored by GSA using BET model. The acidity of Al-MCM-41 was analyzed by FTIR by pyridine absorption method. Al-MCM-41 catalyst was used to convert polypropylene plastic waste in 200 mL catalytic convertion reactor. The Al-MCM-41 catalyst was used for three times and coded as sample A, B, and C. The results showed that sample A, B, and C produce hydrocarbon fraction (C8-C12) liquid fuel with a composition of 92.76; 91.92; and 90.58%, respectively. The repeated use of the catalyst causes a decrease in the composition of the hydrocarbon fraction (C8-C12) due to decrease of catalyst performance as observed by a TON (Turn Over Number) value which increased from 0.075%/gram to 0.156%/gram. Based on physical test i.e. boiling point, flash point, density, viscosity, and calorific value, it was proved that hydrocarbon fuels A, B and C have characteristics that in accordance with standard, premium gasoline, as specified in SNI 06-3506- 1994 and HIBER11Z international standards issued by Hibernia Petroleum Canada in 2016. © 2018 Author(s).",Al-MCM-41; catalytic convertion; Hidrocarbon liquid fuel; poly propylene plastic waste,,American Institute of Physics Inc.
Peroxidases-assisted removal of environmentally-related hazardous pollutants with reference to the reaction mechanisms of industrial dyes,"Bilal M., Rasheed T., Iqbal H.M.N., Yan Y.",2018,Science of the Total Environment,"Environmental protection is one of the most important challenges for the humankind. Increasing number of emerging pollutants resulting from industrial/human-made activities represents a serious menace to the ecological and environmental equilibrium. Industrial dyes, endocrine disrupters, pesticides, phenols and halogenated phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and other xenobiotics are among the top priority environmental pollutants. Some classical remediation approaches including physical, chemical and biological are being employed, but are ineffective in cleaning the environment. Enzyme-catalyzed transformation reactions are gearing accelerating attention in this context as potential alternatives to classical chemical methods. Peroxidases are catalysts able to decontaminate an array of toxic compounds by a free radical mechanism resulting in oxidized or depolymerized products along with a significant toxicity reduction. Admittedly, enzymatic catalysis offers the hallmark of high chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity and superior catalytic efficiency under given reaction environment. Moreover, enzymes are considered more benign, socially acceptable and greener production routes since derived from the renewable and sustainable feedstock. Regardless of their versatility and potential use in environmental processes, several limitations, such as heterologous production, catalytic stability, and redox potential should be overcome to implement peroxidases at large-scale transformation and bio-elimination of recalcitrant pollutants. In this article, a critical review of the transformation of different types of hazardous pollutants by peroxidases, with special reference to the proposed reaction mechanisms of several dyes is presented. Following that major challenges for industrial and environmental applications of peroxidases are also discussed. Towards the end, the information is also given on miscellaneous applications of peroxidases, concluding remarks and outlook. © 2018",Catalytic pathways; Emerging pollutants; Emerging pollutants; Environmental protection; Hazardous contaminants; Industrial dyes; Peroxidases,"Biochemistry; Catalysis; Chemical cleaning; Enantioselectivity; Endocrine disrupters; Environmental protection; Enzymes; Free radicals; Hazards; Phenols; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Redox reactions; Stripping (dyes); Catalytic pathways; Chemical and biologicals; Emerging pollutants; Environmental applications; Environmental pollutants; Hazardous contaminants; Peroxidases; Transformation Reactions; Pollution; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; chlorphenotane; dye; endosulfan; estradiol; genistein; hydrogen peroxide; nonylphenol; peroxidase; pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; sitosterol; triclosan; xenobiotic agent; coloring agent; peroxidase; catalysis; catalyst; chemical reaction; dye; environmental protection; pollutant removal; toxicity; biocatalysis; catalysis; degradation; economics; environmental impact; environmental parameters; industrial production; oxidation reduction potential; physical chemistry; priority journal; protein engineering; reaction analysis; Review; synthesis; waste component removal; bioremediation; human; metabolism; pollutant; Biodegradation, Environmental; Coloring Agents; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Peroxidases; Pesticides; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons",Elsevier B.V.
"Prenatal alcohol exposure, biomarkers and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders","Gard P.R., Zanganeh M., Timson D.J.",2018,"Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Recognition, Differential Diagnosis and Long-Term Effects","Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is the term used to describe neurobehavioral disorders associated with prenatal alcohol exposure ranging from the most severe Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) with facial dysmorphology, through partial Fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS) to alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). Many of the cognitive impairments associated with FASD are similar to those seen in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autistic Spectrum Disorders and other such conditions. There are considerable problems in diagnosing FASD and evidence of more than minimal exposure to ethanol during pregnancy is an important criterion. Information on the mother's alcohol consumption during pregnancy may not be available, or may be inaccurate. Furthermore, approximately half of children affected by FASD may not exhibit signs of CNS dysfunction until they are preschool or school-age when the child and the mother may have become separated. Early accurate differential diagnosis would enable the most effective treatments to be used. Ideally biomarkers would be identified which would enable confirmation of prenatal alcohol exposure. The use of meconium as an accessible fetal source of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulfate (EtS) is frequently considered, but this is only applicable for the first few days of the neonate's life. The use of neonatal blood phosphatidylethanol (PEth) has also been discussed, but again the longevity of this biomarker is short. More recently results from animal studies of neonatal plasma microRNA biomarkers and changes to histone modifications have provided new opportunities, and DNA methylation has been suggested as a potential biomarker. Our own work suggests that prenatal alcohol exposure may induce long-lived changes in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and brain aminopeptidase activity which may be reflected in changes in plasma or urine. In the light of the evidence that many fetuses are exposed to alcohol but do not exhibit any degree of FASD, this review will assess the evidence of reliability of emerging enduring markers of prenatal alcohol exposure and explore whether they correlate only with prenatal alcohol exposure or also with FASD. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Novel Nanoimaging Strategies for Noninvasive Graft Monitoring in Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation,"Janjic J.M., Gorantla V.S.",2018,Current Transplantation Reports,"This article focuses on the unmet needs and key challenges in vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) and the opportunities for current nanotechnology advances in therapeutics and diagnostics for personalized treatment and optimization of clinical outcomes. The transformative role of nanoimaging as a noninvasive tool in the longitudinal surveillance of acute and chronic rejection after VCA is critically reviewed. Nanoimaging can inform management decisions and guide continuous treatment adjustments over time in patients to improve safety and efficacy in VCA. Nanoimaging signatures can be unbiased and quantitative measures of treatment effectiveness as well as medication adherence, both of which are critical prerequisites for overall graft survival and patient quality of life. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Acute rejection; Chronic rejection; Imaging; Immunomodulation; Monitoring; MRI; Nanoemulsions; Nanoimaging; NIRF; Perfluorocarbons; PET,,Springer
Socio-economic status and health: Evaluation of human biomonitored chemical exposure to per-and polyfluorinated substances across status,"Buekers J., Colles A., Cornelis C., Morrens B., Govarts E., Schoeters G.",2018,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Research on the environment, health, and well-being nexus (EHWB) is shifting from a silo toward a systemic approach that includes the socio-economic context. To disentangle further the complex interplay between the socio-exposome and internal chemical exposure, we performed a meta-analysis of human biomonitoring (HBM) studies with internal exposure data on per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and detailed information on risk factors, including descriptors of socio-economic status (SES) of the study population. PFASs are persistent in nature, and some have endocrine-disrupting properties. Individual studies have shown that HBM biomarker concentrations of PFASs generally increase with SES indicators, e.g., for income. Based on a meta-analysis (five studies) of the associations between PFASs and SES indicators, the magnitude of the association could be estimated. For the SES indicator income, changes in income were expressed by a factor change, which was corrected by the Gini coefficient to take into account the differences in income categories between studies, and the income range between countries. For the SES indicator education, we had to conclude that descriptors (<college, x years of study, etc.) differed too widely between studies to perform a meta-analysis. Therefore, the use of the uniform ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education) is recommended in future studies. The meta-analysis showed that a higher income is associated with a higher internal exposure to PFASs (PFOS or perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, PFOA or perfluorooctanoic acid, PFNA or perfluorononanoic acid, PFHxS or perfluorohexane sulfonate). This is opposite to the environmental justice hypothesis, referring to an inequitable distribution of detrimental environmental effects toward poor and minority communities by a practice or policy. With a doubling of the income, internal exposure increased on average by 10%–14%. Possible explanations for this difference are given, e.g., underlying differences in diet. However, other sources can also contribute, and the exact causes of SES-related differences in PFAS concentrations remain unclear. Studies are needed that include social descriptors together with lifestyle and dietary information as explanatory variables for internal chemical exposure levels. This will help clarify the underlying factors that link SES with inequity to environmental exposures, and will raise awareness and knowledge to strengthen the capacities of people and communities to advocate chemical exposure reduction in order to reduce this health inequity. © 2018 by the authors.

Enantioselectivity in biotransformation and bioaccumulation processes of typical chiral contaminants,"Xu C., Lin X., Yin S., Zhao L., Liu Y., Liu K., Li F., Yang F., Liu W.",2018,Environmental Pollution,"Chirality is a critical topic in the medicinal and agrochemical fields. One quarter of all agrochemicals was chiral in 1996, and this proportion has increased remarkably with the introduction of new compounds over time. Despite scientists have made great efforts to probe the enantiomeric selectivity of chiral chemicals in the environment since early 1990s, the different behaviours of individual enantiomers in biologically mediated processes are still unclear. In the present review, we highlight state-of-the-knowledge on the stereoselective biotransformation and accumulation of chiral contaminants in organisms ranging from invertebrates to humans. Chiral insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pharmaceuticals, flame retardants hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are all included in the target compounds. Key findings included: a) Changes in the enantiomeric fractions in vitro and in vivo models revealed that enantioselectivity commonly occurs in biotransformation and bioaccumulation. b) Emerging contaminants have become more important in the field of enantioselectivity together with their metabolites in biological transformation process. c) Chiral signatures have also been regarded as powerful tools for tracking pollution sources when the contribution of precursor is unknown. Future studies are needed in order to understand not only preliminary enrichment results but also detailed molecular mechanisms in diverse models to comprehensively understand the behaviours of chiral compounds.

The biological role of N-acyl-homoserine lactone-based quorum sensing (QS) in EPS production and microbial community assembly during anaerobic granulation process,"Ma H., Ma S., Hu H., Ding L., Ren H.",2018,Scientific Reports,"Although N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone (AHL) based quorum sensing (QS) phenomenon has been observed in mature anaerobic granules, the biological role of AHL-based QS system in anaerobic granulation process remains unexplored. For the first time, a long-term anaerobic bioreactor was operated for 168 days to investigate the biological role of AHL in the granulation process which was divided into three phases (phase I: floccular, phase II: granulation, phase III: maturation). Two different AHLs including C8-HSL and C10-HSL were characterized at nanogram levels. The AHL level was elevated over 20-fold and strongly positively correlated with extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production and sludge particle size during phase I-II. Exogenous addition of AHL to the floccular sludge also resulted in significantly increased EPS production. Metadata analysis suggested that the granulation process was accompanied by an increase in the abundance of QS-relevant microorganisms. The strong relationships (R > 0.9233, p < 0.01) among AHL concentrations, EPS (except loosely bound EPS), granulation and community variation indicated that AHL-mediated QS played an important role in coordinating community level behaviors associated with granulation, potentially through the regulation of EPS production and composition. This study gives a deep insight into the underlying QS-relevant mechanism of anaerobic granulation process. © 2018, The Author(s).",,gamma butyrolactone; homoserine lactone; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; quorum sensing; sewage; 4-Butyrolactone; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Extracellular Polymeric Substance Matrix; Microbiota; Quorum Sensing; Sewage,Nature Publishing Group
A critical review of the occurrence of perfluoroalkyl acids in aqueous environments and their removal by adsorption onto carbon nanotubes,"Oyetade O.A., Varadwaj G.B.B., Nyamori V.O., Jonnalagadda S.B., Martincigh B.S.",2018,Reviews in Environmental Science and Biotechnology,"The presence of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in aquatic environments is a cause of concern, due to their toxicity, possible ecological impact and adverse effects in man. The release of these pollutants into receiving water bodies occurs primarily through the discharge of untreated wastewater and industrial effluents. Consequently, there is a need to remediate wastewater containing these compounds before its discharge. In this review, the occurrence of PFAAs in water streams is reviewed, with the aim of providing in-depth information on the harmful effects arising through exposure to these pollutants by both man and the environment. One viable strategy for the removal of PFAAs from wastewaters is adsorption. This technique is discussed in relation to a number of conventional adsorbents and they are compared with the behaviour of a more effective adsorbent, namely, carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In particular, various functionalization strategies can increase the efficiency of CNTs for the removal of PFAAs. Sorption of PFAAs onto CNTs demonstrates good removal efficiencies and equilibrium is attained faster than with conventional adsorbents. This is attributed to the inherent properties of CNTs, such as large surface area/porosity, and the ease with which new functional groups are introduced onto the walls of the tubes. The adsorption mechanism of PFAAs is primarily enhanced through electrostatic interactions; however, other intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions and ion-exchange, also play a role. This review aims at providing information on the occurrence and fate of PFAAs and the interactions involved in their removal from aqueous solutions by CNTs. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",Adsorption; Carbon nanotubes; Mechanism; Perfluoroalkyl acids; Wastewater,,Springer Netherlands
Glucose challenge metabolomics implicates medium-chain acylcarnitines in insulin resistance,"Nowak C., Hetty S., Salihovic S., Castillejo-Lopez C., Ganna A., Cook N.L., Broeckling C.D., Prenni J.E., Shen X., Giedraitis V., Ärnlöv J., Lind L., Berne C., Sundström J., Fall T., Ingelsson E.",2018,Scientific Reports,"Insulin resistance (IR) predisposes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease but its causes are incompletely understood. Metabolic challenges like the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) can reveal pathogenic mechanisms. We aimed to discover associations of IR with metabolite trajectories during OGTT. In 470 non-diabetic men (age 70.6 ± 0.6 years), plasma samples obtained at 0, 30 and 120 minutes during an OGTT were analyzed by untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics. IR was assessed with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp method. We applied age-adjusted linear regression to identify metabolites whose concentration change was related to IR. Nine trajectories, including monounsaturated fatty acids, lysophosphatidylethanolamines and a bile acid, were significantly associated with IR, with the strongest associations observed for medium-chain acylcarnitines C10 and C12, and no associations with L-carnitine or C2-, C8-, C14- or C16-carnitine. Concentrations of C10- and C12-carnitine decreased during OGTT with a blunted decline in participants with worse insulin resistance. Associations persisted after adjustment for obesity, fasting insulin and fasting glucose. In mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to different acylcarnitines, we observed blunted insulin-stimulated glucose uptake after treatment with C10- or C12-carnitine. In conclusion, our results identify medium-chain acylcarnitines as possible contributors to IR. © 2018 The Author(s).",,"acylcarnitine; carnitine; glucose; 3T3-L1 cell line; aged; animal; glucose tolerance test; human; insulin resistance; lipolysis; male; metabolism; metabolomics; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; 3T3-L1 Cells; Aged; Animals; Carnitine; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glucose; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Lipolysis; Male; Metabolomics; Mice",Nature Publishing Group
Modelling Laboratory Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis Using Cobalt Catalysts,"Díaz-Trujillo L.A., Toledo-Chávez G., Jiménez-García G., Hernández-Escoto H., Maya-Yescas R.",2018,International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering,"The main goal of this paper is to critically review current microkinetics available for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) modelling, in order to propose the best way to follow this set of complex reactions; therefore a microkinetic model was developed for FTS, accomplishing surface chemistry, heterogeneous kinetics, and single-event previous development for Co-based catalysts. Model starts simulating CO activation on catalyst surface, and then formation of methane, ethane and subsequent chain growth. Reaction rates were derived following the formalism of Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW); surface steps were proposed in consequence of feasibility. Chain growth was modelled by single-event steps, taking into account geometrical conformation explicitly. Number of growth steps of 1-olefins was rectified as requiring one more active site than mechanisms proposed previously; it was found that formation of these olefins exhibits a fast drop in chain growth; this phenomenon is explained in terms of probable geometrical conformations that lead to the number of single events. Experimental results in literature about isothermal synthesis of hydrocarbons in the gasoline range were simulated in a fixed-bed laboratory reactor; thermodynamic consistency was derived from chemical equilibrium over all reactions occurring during FTS. Equilibrium constants were evaluated as function of Gibbs free energy, and partial pressures of reactants and products. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; isothermal laboratory reactor; micro-kinetics; reactor simulation; single-event kinetics,Catalysts; Chains; Cobalt; Conformations; Equilibrium constants; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Isotherms; Kinetics; Reaction rates; Surface chemistry; Geometrical conformation; Heterogeneous kinetics; Laboratory reactors; Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson; Micro kinetics; Reactor simulation; Single event; Thermodynamic consistency; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis,De Gruyter
Integrating proteomic or transcriptomic data into metabolic models using linear bound flux balance analysis,"Tian M., Reed J.L.",2018,Bioinformatics,"Motivation Transcriptomics and proteomics data have been integrated into constraint-based models to influence flux predictions. However, it has been reported recently for Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that model predictions from parsimonious flux balance analysis (pFBA), which does not use expression data, are as good or better than predictions from various algorithms that integrate transcriptomics or proteomics data into constraint-based models. Results In this paper, we describe a novel constraint-based method called Linear Bound Flux Balance Analysis (LBFBA), which uses expression data (either transcriptomic or proteomic) to predict metabolic fluxes. The method uses expression data to place soft constraints on individual fluxes, which can be violated. Parameters in the soft constraints are first estimated from a training expression and flux dataset before being used to predict fluxes from expression data in other conditions. We applied LBFBA to E.coli and S.cerevisiae datasets and found that LBFBA predictions were more accurate than pFBA predictions, with average normalized errors roughly half of those from pFBA. For the first time, we demonstrate a computational method that integrates expression data into constraint-based models and improves quantitative flux predictions over pFBA.

Intracranial foreign material granulomas after cranial surgery,"Al-Afif S., Hatipoglu Majernik G., Hermann E.J., Esmaeilzadeh M., Hartmann C., Krauss J.K.",2018,Acta Neurochirurgica,"Background: Various synthetic materials are used in neurosurgery and left in place intentionally during surgery for several purposes such as hemostasis, dural closure, or cranioplasty. Although leaving such substances in surgical sites is considered safe, in general, foreign body granuloma may occur months or years after intracranial surgery. Thus, far relatively little is known about treatment and outcome of such lesions. Methods: A systematic review of 3466 histopathological examinations after cranial surgeries achieved over a 13-year period was performed. After excluding patients with Teflon granulomas or infection, a total of 12 patients with foreign body granulomas induced by synthetic material used in a prior surgery were identified. Patient records, imaging studies, and histopathological data were analyzed. Furthermore, postoperative outcome was assessed. Results: Mean age at the second surgery was 51 years (range, 11–68 years). The median time between the primary and the secondary surgery was 13 months (range, 1–545 months). Eight patients (75%) presented with signs and symptoms related to the foreign body granulomas. Total resection of the foreign body granulomas was performed in all patients. The granulomas were induced by oxidized cellulose polymer (n = 6), suture material (n = 3), Gelfoam (n = 1), methylmethacrylate (n = 1), and bone wax (n = 1). The mean postoperative follow-up time was 54 months (range 1–137 months). There was symptomatic improvement in all instances. Imaging studies did not demonstrate any recurrence. Conclusion: Despite its rarity, foreign body granuloma should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of intracranial mass lesions especially in cases of suspected tumor recurrence after prior surgery. The pathogenesis of foreign body granuloma still needs further clarification. Our study demonstrates that they have good prognosis after surgical removal. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Foreign body; Granuloma; Intracranial tumor; Tumor-like lesion,"bone wax; gelfoam; methacrylic acid methyl ester; oxidized cellulose; polymer; suture material; gelatin sponge; adult; aged; Article; child; clinical article; differential diagnosis; diffusion weighted imaging; female; follow up; foreign body granuloma; human; human tissue; male; outcome assessment; priority journal; skull surgery; symptomatology; systematic review; tumor recurrence; adolescent; adverse device effect; adverse event; brain; foreign body granuloma; middle aged; neurosurgery; postoperative complication; surgery; suture; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Brain; Child; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Gelatin Sponge, Absorbable; Granuloma, Foreign-Body; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neurosurgical Procedures; Postoperative Complications; Sutures",Springer-Verlag Wien
Retinal toxicity of medical devices used during vitreoretinal surgery: A critical overview,"Januschowski K., Irigoyen C., Pastor J.C., Srivastava G.K., Romano M.R., Heimann H., Stalmans P., Van Keer K., Boden K., Szurman P., Spitzer M.S.",2018,Ophthalmologica,"Retinal toxicity/biocompatibility of medical devices in direct contact with the retina is an important subject for clinicians and scientists. As these effects are not very frequent, there is also a relative lack of information for many clinicians. The past has taught us multiple times that there is a significant safety problem associated with severe loss of vision in affected patients. In this review, we want to classify medical products that are used in the back of the eye, describe recent examples of toxicity, critically reflect on the regulations that exist and suggest improvements that can be done to ensure patient safety without hindering innovation. Methods: Critical review of the recent papers and personal experience of the authors in this issue. Medical devices used in the back of the eye and recent examples of toxicity are described, regulations that exist are critically reflected and improvements suggested that can ensure patient safety without hindering innovation. Results: There is clear evidence of toxicity after intraocular surgery in any category. Some cytotoxic indirect methods have failed in detecting this toxicity. Some ISO rules do not seem appropriate. Postmarketing safety is missing. There is little data on this issue. Conclusions: The absence of a clear regulation of the production, purification and evaluation of the toxic effects of the medical devices supposes the possibility that products are not sufficiently safe to obtain the CE mark. © 2018 S.

Fluorinated Prolines as Conformational Tools and Reporters for Peptide and Protein Chemistry,"Verhoork S.J.M., Killoran P.M., Coxon C.R.",2018,Biochemistry,"Amide bonds at the proline nitrogen are particularly susceptible to rotation, affording cis and trans isomers. Installation of a stereochemically defined electron-withdrawing fluorine atom or fluorinated groups has the power to influence the cis-trans conformational preferences of the amide bond in X-(F)Pro (where X = any other amino acid). Advantageously, this also provides a sensitive reporter for 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of protein conformation, interactions, and dynamics. We deliberately use the term ""fluorinated prolines"" as an all-encompassing term to describe proline analogues containing one or more fluorine atoms and to avoid confusion with the more well-known 4-fluoroprolines. This review presents a critical discussion of the growing repertoire of fluorinated prolines that have been described and, importantly, provides a comparison of their uses and relative influence on amide-bond conformation and discusses the significant potential of using 19F NMR as a tool to probe conformational changes in polypeptides. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,Amides; Fluorine; Isomers; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Proteins; Cis and trans isomers; Conformational change; Conformational preferences; Critical discussions; Electronwithdrawing; Fluorinated prolines; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR); Protein conformation; Conformations; 3 fluoroproline derivative; 4 fluoroproline derivative; amide; fluorinated proline derivative; fluorine derivative; pentafluorophenylhydroxyproline; perfluoro tert butyl hydroxyproline; polypeptide; proline derivative; trifluoromethyl derivative; unclassified drug; peptide; proline; protein; chemical bond; chemical structure; cis trans isomerism; comparative study; fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance; human; molecular biology; priority journal; protein conformation; Review; stereochemistry; chemistry; halogenation; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; protein conformation; Halogenation; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Peptides; Proline; Protein Conformation; Proteins,American Chemical Society
Selection of Priority Contaminants in a Watershed Using Risk Ranking Methodology [基于环境风险排序的流域优先污染物筛选],"Li Q.-F., Lü Y.-L., Wang P., Zhang Y.-Q.",2018,Huanjing Kexue/Environmental Science,"The present study focuses on the risk rankings of different contaminants from Daling River in Liaoning Province, China, for categorizing the environmental risk levels in the river. Eighteen surface water samples were collected from Daling River, which has been polluted by the surrounding fluorine industries for years. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and heavy metals were analyzed, and relevant eco-toxicity data obtained from literatures were considered. The median concentrations of PFOS and PFOA were observed as 0.77-3.57 ng•L -1 and 82.93-344 ng•L -1 , respectively, which were lower than the standard limits of the United Kingdom. The concentrations of heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were found to be lower than level Ⅳ of the Chinese national environmental quality standards for surface water. The maximum concentrations of mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As) were higher than the standard level Ⅲ. The environmental risks ranged from 1.42×10 -6 to 2.3×10 -2 . The order of the risks by potential environmental contaminants was Cu&gt;Zn&gt;As&gt;p,p'-DDE&gt;p,p'-DDT&gt;Cd&gt;Pb&gt;Hg&gt;PFOA&gt; γ-HCH&gt;Cr&gt;Ni&gt;α-HCH&gt;PFOS. The present findings revealed that the environmental risks of PFOS and PFOA were relatively low and these were not taken as priority contaminants, but the accumulation risks could not be overlooked for a long time. Among the contaminants, copper (Cu) was the priority contaminant of Daling River. Hence, necessary measures are recommended to reduce the potential effects of contaminants on the environment. © 2018, Science Press.

Perfluorinated chemicals as emerging environmental threats to kidney health: A scoping review,"Stanifer J.W., Stapleton H.M., Souma T., Wittmer A., Zhao X., Boulware L.E.",2018,Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology,"Background and objectives Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large group of manufactured nonbiodegradable compounds. Despite increasing awareness as global pollutants, the impact of PFAS exposure on human health is not well understood, and there are growing concerns for adverse effects on kidney function. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review to summarize and identify gaps in the understanding between PFAS exposure and kidney health. Design, setting, participants, & measurements We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO Global Health, World Health Organization Global Index, and Web of Science for studies published from 1990 to 2018. We included studies on the epidemiology, pharmacokinetics, or toxicology of PFAS exposure and kidney-related health, including clinical, histologic, molecular, and metabolic outcomes related to kidney disease, or outcomes related to the pharmacokinetic role of the kidneys. Results We identified 74 studies, including 21 epidemiologic, 13 pharmacokinetic, and 40 toxicological studies. Three population-based epidemiologic studies demonstrated associations between PFAS exposure and lower kidney function. Along with toxicology studies (n=10) showing tubular histologic and cellular changes from PFAS exposure, pharmacokinetic studies (n=5) demonstrated the kidneys were major routes of elimination, with active proximal tubule transport. In several studies (n=17), PFAS exposure altered several pathways linked to kidney disease, including oxidative stress pathways, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor pathways, NF-E2– related factor 2 pathways, partial epithelial mesenchymal transition, and enhanced endothelial permeability through actin filament modeling. Conclusions A growing body of evidence portends PFASs are emerging environmental threats to kidney health; yet several important gaps in our understanding still exist. © 2018 by the American Society of Nephrology.",,antioxidant; creatinine; environmental chemical; organic anion transporter; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; peroxisome proliferator; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; sex hormone; sirtuin 1; transcription factor Nrf2; urate transporter; fluorocarbon; actin filament; adverse event; apoptosis; Article; chronic kidney failure; data extraction; energy metabolism; environmental exposure; epithelial mesenchymal transition; exposure; glomerulus filtration rate; glucose metabolism; glutathione metabolism; health; homeostasis; human; hyperplasia; hypertrophy; kidney fibrosis; kidney function; kidney mass; mortality; nephrotoxicity; oxidative stress; pharmacokinetics; prevalence; protein binding; proteinuria; public health; risk factor; treatment outcome; urea nitrogen blood level; adverse event; kidney disease; pollutant; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbon Polymers; Humans; Kidney Diseases,American Society of Nephrology
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure in early life increases risk of childhood adiposity: A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies,"Liu P., Yang F., Wang Y., Yuan Z.",2018,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Some articles have examined perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure in early life in relation to risk of childhood adiposity. Nevertheless, the results from epidemiological studies exploring the associations remain inconsistent and contradictory. We thus conducted an analysis of data currently available to examine the association between PFOA exposure in early life and risk of childhood adiposity. The PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify studies that examined the impact of PFOA exposure in early life on childhood adiposity. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to pool the statistical estimates. We identified ten prospective cohort studies comprising 6076 participants with PFOA exposure. The overall effect size (relative risk or odds ratio) for childhood overweight was 1.25 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.50; I2 = 40.5%). In addition, exposure to PFOA in early life increased the z-score of childhood body mass index (β = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.17; I2 = 27.9%). Accordingly, exposure to PFOA in early life is associated with an increased risk for childhood adiposity. Further research is needed to verify these findings and to shed light on the molecular mechanism of PFOA in adiposity. © 2018 by the authors.

Emerging pollutants removal through advanced drinking water treatment: A review on processes and environmental performances assessment,"Teodosiu C., Gilca A.-F., Barjoveanu G., Fiore S.",2018,Journal of Cleaner Production,"The presence of emerging pollutants in the aquatic environment in relatively small concentrations and the fact that they cannot be removed by conventional water/wastewater treatment processes bring new challenges in terms of adequate selection of technologies from the technical, economical and environmental points of view. Generally, literature discusses emerging pollutants’ removal at significant concentrations (such as those in wastewater), while few studies consider their low concentrations occurring in raw water. This study presents a comprehensive review of the research efforts related to the occurrence, fate, health effects and impacts of emerging pollutants on advanced drinking water treatment and the environmental performance evaluation of different technological options, with a focus on pilot and full-scale installations. All presented case studies consider pollutants removed, process conditions and removal efficiencies, thus making possible comparisons between membrane processes, advanced oxidation processes and adsorption on activated carbon and other materials. The study is completed by an analysis of the environmental assessment instruments (life cycle assessment, carbon, water footprints, other type of assessments) that may be used for selecting sustainable advanced drinking water treatment processes able to remove emerging pollutants. This paper critically reviews the main research topics concerning emerging pollutants: classification, legislative framework, up-to-date removal processes and their environmental performances assessment, to offer a comprehensive analysis of the strategic issues that may constitute future research directions for sustainable water supply. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Assessments; Drinking water treatment; Emerging; Environmental; Pollutants; Priority,Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Life cycle; Potable water; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water supply; Assessments; Emerging; Environmental; Pollutants; Priority; Water pollution,Elsevier Ltd
Patent foramen ovale closure for patients with cryptogenic stroke: A systematic review and comprehensive meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials and 14 observational studies,"Chen X., Chen S.-D., Dong Y., Dong Q.",2018,CNS Neuroscience and Therapeutics,"Background: Previous review from randomized controlled trials (RCT) showed that patients with cryptogenic stroke may benefit from patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. However, the findings from the systematic review were not clear when observational studies were also included. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The primary endpoints were recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The secondary outcomes were all-cause death, atrial fibrillation (AF), and hemorrhagic events. Results: Five randomized trials and fourteen observational studies (6301 participants) were eligible. PFO closure was superior to medical therapy for stroke prevention risk ratios ([RR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24-0.60), but showed increased risk of AF (RR, 4.96; 95% CI, 2.31-10.7). There was no significant difference in TIA recurrence, death, and hemorrhagic events. Subgroup analyses showed that patients with factors such as substantial residual shunt, the presence of atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), male, and age <45 years had a lower risk of recurrent stroke when PFOs were closed. Conclusions: In patients with cryptogenic stroke, PFO closure does appeared to be superior to medical therapy in stroke prevention, with an increased incidence of AF. Male, age <45 years, substantial residual shunt, and the history of ASA are the factors that will predict the benefit when PFO is closed. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",cryptogenic stroke; meta-analysis; patent foramen ovale; secondary prevention,"aneurysm; Article; atrial fibrillation; atrial septal aneurysm; bleeding; cause of death; disease association; follow up; human; incidence; intention to treat analysis; mortality; patent foramen ovale; practice guideline; quantitative study; recurrent disease; risk factor; systematic review; transient ischemic attack; bibliographic database; cerebrovascular accident; complication; endovascular surgery; meta analysis; observational study; patent foramen ovale; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); secondary prevention; statistics and numerical data; transient ischemic attack; fibrinolytic agent; Databases, Bibliographic; Endovascular Procedures; Fibrinolytic Agents; Foramen Ovale, Patent; Humans; Ischemic Attack, Transient; Observational Studies as Topic; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Secondary Prevention; Stroke",Blackwell Publishing Ltd
Percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale vs. medical treatment for patients with history of cryptogenic stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Palaiodimos L., Kokkinidis D.G., Faillace R.T., Foley T.R., Dangas G.D., Price M.J., Mastoris I.",2018,Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine,"Background: Patients with history of cryptogenic stroke are more likely to have a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and should be managed with antithrombotic agents, while the alternative option is percutaneous closure of PFOs. Our aim was to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing percutaneous closure vs. medical treatment for patients with PFO and prior cryptogenic stroke. Methods: Medline, Scopus and Cochrane databases were reviewed. A random-effect model meta-analysis was used and I-square was utilized to assess the heterogeneity. New ischemic stroke was defined as the primary endpoint. A sensitivity analysis was performed for Amplatzer device. Subgroup analyses were performed for different patient and PFO characteristics for the composite endpoints as defined by the included RCTs. Results: In total of 3440 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Closure devices were superior to medical therapy for prevention of recurrent ischemic strokes (HR = 0.29; CI: 0.02–0.56), but were associated with increased risk of new onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (RR = 4.67; CI: 2.22–9.81). However, in the sensitivity analysis for Amplatzer device, there was no difference between the two groups in new onset of atrial arrhythmias. Closure devices were superior across all different subgroups when compared to medical treatment with the exception of patients with a small shunt. Conclusion: This meta-analysis shows that closure devices for patients with PFO and history of cryptogenic stroke can significantly decrease the risk of a new ischemic stroke. The use of Amplatzer device was not associated with increased risk of newly diagnosed atrial arrhythmias. © 2018",,"anticoagulant agent; fibrinolytic agent; Article; atrial fibrillation; bleeding; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; chi square test; clinical effectiveness; Cochrane Library; comparative effectiveness; heart atrium arrhythmia; heart atrium flutter; human; medical care; medical history; Medline; mortality; outcome assessment; patent foramen ovale; patient safety; percutaneous closure; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk reduction; Scopus; sensitivity analysis; surgical technique; systematic review; transient ischemic attack; adult; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; complication; devices; female; heart arrhythmia; heart catheterization; male; meta analysis; middle aged; patent foramen ovale; recurrent disease; risk assessment; risk factor; treatment outcome; Adult; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Brain Ischemia; Cardiac Catheterization; Female; Fibrinolytic Agents; Foramen Ovale, Patent; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recurrence; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Stroke; Treatment Outcome",Elsevier Inc.
Integrative Chemical Proteomics-Metabolomics Approach Reveals Acaca/Acacb as Direct Molecular Targets of PFOA,"Shao X., Ji F., Wang Y., Zhu L., Zhang Z., Du X., Chung A.C.K., Hong Y., Zhao Q., Cai Z.",2018,Analytical Chemistry,"Identification of the direct molecular targets of environmental pollutants is of great importance for toxicity mechanism studies. Despite numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the toxicity mechanism of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), their direct-binding protein targets which trigger downstream toxicity effects remain largely unknown. Herein, we present a systematic chemical proteomic study to profile the target proteins of PFCs by taking PFOA as a representative. Considering its electrophilicity, PFOA could preferentially bind to reactive cysteine-containing proteins. Therefore, two complementary cysteine-targeting probes, iodoacetamide alkyne (IAA) and ethynyl benziodoxolone azide (EBX), were selected to enrich the putative target proteins in the absence or presence of PFOA. Quantitative proteomic analysis of the enriched proteins identified Acaca and Acacb as novel target proteins of PFOA. We then applied parallel reaction monitoring (PRM)-based targeted proteomics study combined with thermal shift assay-based chemical proteomics to verify Acaca and Acacb as bona fide binding targets. These findings afford a plausible explanation for the PFOA-induced liver toxicity, especially regarding abnormal fatty acid metabolism that was validated by targeted metabolomics analysis. The present study documents an integrative chemical proteomics-metabolomics platform that facilitates the authentic identification of proteins that are targeted by small molecules and its potential to be applied for toxicity mechanism studies of environmental pollutants. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Amino acids; Fatty acids; Molecular biology; Molecular physics; Pollution; Toxicity; Authentic identification; Environmental pollutants; Fatty acid metabolism; Parallel reactions; Perfluorinated compound (PFCs); Quantitative proteomic analysis; Targeted proteomics; Toxicity mechanisms; Proteins; Acacb protein, mouse; acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; fluorocarbon; protein binding; animal; C57BL mouse; female; liver; metabolism; metabolomics; procedures; proteomics; Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase; Animals; Female; Fluorocarbons; Liver; Metabolomics; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Protein Binding; Proteomics",American Chemical Society
Organochlorine contaminants and reproductive implication in cetaceans: A case study of the common dolphin,"Murphy S., Law R.J., Deaville R., Barnett J., Perkins M.W., Brownlow A., Penrose R., Davison N.J., Barber J.L., Jepson P.D.",2018,Marine Mammal Ecotoxicology: Impacts of Multiple Stressors on Population Health,"Organochlorines, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), are persistent organic pollutants that both bioaccumulate and biomagnify within marine food webs. These legacy pollutants are known endocrine disruptors and have been reported to have adverse effects on endocrine, reproductive, and immune functions in humans, laboratory animals, and wildlife. This chapter will review evidence of pollutant-mediated effects on the reproductive system in cetaceans from exposure to PCBs and DDT. In addition, an assessment of reproductive failure and reproductive dysfunction was undertaken on stranded and bycaught female common dolphins from the Northeast Atlantic, and their association with exposure to PCBs was investigated. Within the sample, 16.8% (18 out of 107) of females presented with reproductive system pathologies that were associated with higher blubber SPCB lw concentrations, above the threshold for the onset of adverse health effects in marine mammals. Cases of reproductive failure were also reported that may be linked to exposure to these endocrine-disrupting chemicals. The continued exposure to legacy pollutants, and new emerging pollutants, raises concerns about the current and future population-level pollutant effects on Northeast Atlantic common dolphins. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

"Efficient imaging: Examining the value of ultrasound in the diagnosis of traumatic adult brachial plexus injuries, a systematic review","Chin B., Ramji M., Farrokhyar F., Bain J.R.",2018,Clinical Neurosurgery,"Background: Traumatic brachial plexus injury (BPI) can result in debilitating sequelae of the upper extremity. Presently, therapeutic decisions are based on the mechanism of injury, serial physical examination, electromyography, nerve conduction, and imaging studies. While magnetic resonance imaging is the current imaging modality of choice for BPI, ultrasound is a promising newcomer that is inexpensive, accessible, and available at point of care. Objective: To evaluate ultrasound as a diagnostic tool in the assessment of traumatic adult BPI through a systematic review. Methods: An electronic literature search was completed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases up to July 2016. Two independent reviewers completed the screening and data extraction. Methodological quality of studies was evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Statistical analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivities and study heterogeneity. Results: Seven studies were included. Four studies compared the detection of pre- and postganglionic lesions at different levels (C5-T1) to surgical exploration as the reference standard. Sensitivity of lesion detectionwas greater in the upper and middle spinal nerves: C5 (93%, confidence interval [CI] = 78%-100%), C6 (94%, CI = 82%-100%), and C7 (95%, CI = 86%-100%) than in the lower: C8 (71%, CI = 36%-95%) and T1 (56%, CI = 29%-81%). Conclusion: Individual studies demonstrate ultrasound as an effective diagnostic tool for traumatic adult BPI. Sensitivity of lesion detection was noted to be greater in the upper and middle (C5-C7) than in the lower spinal nerves (C8, T1). Further standardized studies should be performed to confirm the utility of ultrasound in the diagnosis of traumatic adult BPI.

Assessment of endocrine disruptors effects on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos by untargeted LC-HRMS metabolomic analysis,"Ortiz-Villanueva E., Jaumot J., Martínez R., Navarro-Martín L., Piña B., Tauler R.",2018,Science of the Total Environment,"Bisphenol A (BPA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and tributyltin (TBT) are emerging endocrine disruptors (EDCs) with still poorly defined mechanisms of toxicity and metabolic effects in aquatic organisms. We used an untargeted liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) metabolomic approach to study the effects of sub-lethal doses of these three EDCs on the metabolic profiles of zebrafish embryos exposed from 48 to 120 hpf (hours post fertilization). Advanced chemometric data analysis methods were used to reveal effects on the subjacent regulatory pathways. EDC treatments induced changes in concentrations of about 50 metabolites for TBT and BPA, and of 25 metabolites for PFOS. The analysis of the corresponding metabolic changes suggested the presence of similar underlying zebrafish responses to BPA, TBT and PFOS affecting the metabolism of glycerophospholipids, amino acids, purines and 2-oxocarboxylic acids. We related the changes in glycerophospholipid metabolism to alterations in absorption of the yolk sack, the main source of nutrients (including lipids) for the developing embryo, linking the molecular markers with adverse phenotypic effects. We propose a general mode of action for all three chemical compounds, probably related to their already described interaction with the PPAR/RXR complex, combined with specific effects on different signaling pathways resulting in particular alterations in the zebrafish embryos metabolism. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Bisphenol A; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Perfluorooctane sulfonate; Tributyltin; Untargeted metabolomics; Zebrafish embryos,"Aquatic organisms; Insecticides; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Metabolites; Phenols; Physiology; Bis-phenol a; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Metabolomics; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Tributyltin; Zebrafish embryos; Endocrine disrupters; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; biological marker; glycerophospholipid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; purine derivative; retinoid X receptor; tributyltin; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; alkanesulfonic acid; benzhydryl derivative; endocrine disruptor; fluorocarbon; organotin compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; phenol derivative; tributyltin; assessment method; embryo; endocrine disruptor; fish; metabolism; tributyltin; adult; amino acid metabolism; aquatic species; Article; chemometric analysis; controlled study; embryo; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; metabolomics; nonhuman; phenotype; pollutant; priority journal; protein interaction; signal transduction; zebra fish; animal; drug effect; embryo development; growth, development and aging; liquid chromatography; metabolism; metabolome; metabolomics; nonmammalian embryo; tandem mass spectrometry; toxicity; water pollutant; zebra fish; Danio rerio; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Benzhydryl Compounds; Chromatography, Liquid; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Endocrine Disruptors; Fluorocarbons; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Phenols; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Trialkyltin Compounds; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zebrafish",Elsevier B.V.
Analytical approaches for the determination of personal care products and evaluation of their occurrence in marine organisms,"Montesdeoca-Esponda S., Checchini L., Del Bubba M., Sosa-Ferrera Z., Santana-Rodriguez J.J.",2018,Science of the Total Environment,"Contamination of the aquatic environment caused by multiple human activities may exert a negative impact on all living organisms. Several contaminants of emerging concern such as personal care products (PCPs) are continuously released into the aquatic environment where they are biologically active and persistent. This work reviews the current knowledge, provided by papers published after 2010 and indexed by SciFinder, Scopus, and Google search engines, about the determination and occurrence of PCPs in marine biota. Analytical methodologies have been critically reviewed, emphasizing the importance of green and high-throughput approaches and focusing the discussion on the complexity of the solute-matrix interaction in the extraction step, as well as the matrix effect in the instrumental determination. Finally, the worldwide distribution of PCPs is surveyed, taking into account the concentrations found in the same organism in different marine environments. Differences among various world areas have been highlighted, evidencing some critical aspects from an environmental point of view. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Emerging pollutants; Extraction methods; GC–MS; LC–MS; Marine biota; Worldwide distribution,"Extraction; Impurities; Marine biology; Marine pollution; Search engines; Analytical methodology; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Emerging pollutants; Extraction method; High-throughput approaches; Marine biota; Solute-matrix interaction; Worldwide distribution; Aquatic organisms; chemical compound; disinfectant agent; fragrance; personal care product; preservative; stabilizing agent; unclassified drug; cosmetic; aquatic environment; biota; complexity; concentration (composition); human activity; marine ecosystem; PPCP; solute; spatial distribution; analytic method; analytical parameters; bioaccumulation; biota; chemical analysis; chemical interaction; environmental impact; green chemistry; high throughput screening; human activities; marine species; nonhuman; physical chemistry; priority journal; Review; ultraviolet radiation; water contamination; analysis; aquatic species; chemistry; environmental monitoring; metabolism; statistics and numerical data; water pollutant; water pollution; Scopus; Aquatic Organisms; Cosmetics; Environmental Monitoring; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical",Elsevier B.V.
Metabolomic study for essential hypertension patients based on dried blood spot mass spectrometry approach,"Bai Q., Peng B., Wu X., Cao Y., Sun X., Hong M., Na R., Liu B., Li Q., Li Z., Fang W., Zhu N., Zong C., Yu Q.",2018,IUBMB Life,"Hypertension is an increasingly serious public-health challenge worldwide. The traditional blood pressure measurement method could easily and reliably detect blood pressure. However, the delayed symptom onset may influence the screening of essential hypertension (EH). In addition, EH is significantly associated to cardiovascular disease, stroke and kidney disease. Hence, it is urgent to define associated biomarkers with early diagnosis potential for EH. A dried blood spot method integrated with direct infusion mass spectrometry (MS) metabolomic analysis was applied for the detection of metabolites toward 87 EH patients and 91 healthy controls (HC). Multiple algorithms were run on training set (62 EH and 64 HC) for selecting differential metabolites as potential biomarkers. A test set (25 EH and 27 HC) was used to verify and evaluate selected potential biomarkers. A novel blood biomarker model based on Gly, Orn, C10, Orn/Cit, Phe/Tyr, and C5-OH/C8 exhibited potential to differentiate EH patients from HC individuals, with a sensitivity of 0.8400 and a specificity of 0.8889 in test set. The metabolomic analysis of EH is beneficial to the definition of disease-associated biomarkers and the development of new diagnostic approaches. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 70(8):777–785, 2018. © 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology",biomarker; hypertension; mass spectrometry; metabolomics,"biological marker; biological marker; adult; area under the curve; Article; controlled study; dried blood spot testing; essential hypertension; female; human; major clinical study; male; mass spectrometry; metabolite; metabolomics; middle aged; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; aged; blood; essential hypertension; genetics; mass spectrometry; metabolomics; procedures; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Dried Blood Spot Testing; Essential Hypertension; Female; Humans; Male; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolomics; Middle Aged",Blackwell Publishing Ltd

Relating concentrations of these “waste” materials in wastewater influent streams to population-scale use, consumption, or rates of exposure, can provide important qualitative or quantitative information on the activity of inhabitants within a given wastewater catchment. Many publications in this field of study have focussed on the usage of pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, tobacco and alcohol. However, many other potential applications are emerging which can contribute useful knowledge on human health, exposure to industrial chemicals, infectious diseases or pathogens and antibiotic resistance. This review summarises the established wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) biomarkers, and presents a critical review of the current capabilities of WBE. We further discuss possible future strategies and challenges anticipated in analysing wastewater to measure chemical markers of population health as well as biological markers of microbial exposure and disease. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Antibiotic resistance; Illicit drugs; Microbiome; Pharmaceuticals and personal care products; Population health; Wastewater based epidemiology,Biomarkers; Catchments; Epidemiology; Industrial chemicals; Antibiotic resistance; Illicit drug; Microbiome; Pharmaceuticals and personal care products; Population health; Antibiotics; alcohol; antibiotic agent; antidepressant agent; antihistaminic agent; benzodiazepine derivative; biological marker; biological product; caffeine; cannabis; chemical compound; cocaine; diamorphine; flame retardant; illicit drug; ketamine; methamphetamine; midomafetamine; new psychoactive substance; opiate; perfluoroalkyl substance; performance enhancing substance; personal care product; pesticide; plasticizer; polyfluoroalkyl substance; prostaglandin F2 alpha; psychotropic agent; unclassified drug; antibiotic resistance; biochemical oxygen demand; biological monitoring; chemical oxygen demand; dietary exposure; environmental exposure; food intake; health care planning; health impact assessment; high risk population; industrial waste; population size; prevalence; priority journal; Review; stress; total quality management; waste water management; water analysis,Elsevier B.V.
Application of elemental lanthanides in the selective c-f activation of trifluoromethylated benzofulvenes providing access to various difluoroalkenes,"Kumar T., Hassine A.B., Martinez A., Harakat D., Chevreux S., Massicot F., Taillefer M., Behr J.-B., Vasse J.-L., Jaroschik F.",2018,Journal of Visualized Experiments,"The selective activation of one carbon-fluorine bond in polyfluorinated aromatic molecules or in trifluoromethyl-containing substrates offers the possibility of accessing unique fluorine-containing molecules, which are difficult to obtain by other synthetic pathways. Among various metals, which can undergo C-F activation, lanthanides (Ln) are good candidates as they form strong Ln-F bonds. Lanthanide metals are strong reducing agents with a redox potential Ln3+/Ln of approximately-2.3 V, which is comparable to the value of the Mg2+/Mg redox couple. In addition, lanthanide metals display a promising functional group tolerance and their reactivity can vary along the lanthanide series, making them suitable reagents for fine-tuning reaction conditions in organic and organometallic transformations. However, due to their oxophilicity, lanthanides react readily with oxygen and water and therefore require special conditions for storage, handling, preparation, and activation. These factors have limited a more widespread use in organic synthesis. We herein present how dysprosium metal-and by analogy all lanthanide metals-can be freshly prepared under anhydrous conditions using glovebox and Schlenk techniques. The freshly filed metal, in combination with aluminum chloride, initiates the selective C-F activation in trifluoromethylated benzofulvenes. The resulting reaction intermediates react with nitroalkenes to obtain a new family of difluoroalkenes. © 2018 Journal of Visualized Experiments.",Aluminum; Benzofulvenes; C-F activation; Dienes; Difluoroalkenes; Lanthanides; Nitroalkenes; Rare earths,alkene; lanthanide; organometallic compound; Alkenes; Lanthanoid Series Elements; Organometallic Compounds,Journal of Visualized Experiments
Fluorinated Gold Nanoparticles for Nanostructure Imaging Mass Spectrometry,"Palermo A., Forsberg E.M., Warth B., Aisporna A.E., Billings E., Kuang E., Benton H.P., Berry D., Siuzdak G.",2018,ACS Nano,"Nanostructure imaging mass spectrometry (NIMS) with fluorinated gold nanoparticles (f-AuNPs) is a nanoparticle assisted laser desorption/ionization approach that requires low laser energy and has demonstrated high sensitivity. Here we describe NIMS with f-AuNPs for the comprehensive analysis of metabolites in biological tissues. F-AuNPs assist in desorption/ionization by laser-induced release of the fluorocarbon chains with minimal background noise. Since the energy barrier required to release the fluorocarbons from the AuNPs is minimal, the energy of the laser is maintained in the low μJ/pulse range, thus limiting metabolite in-source fragmentation. Electron microscopy analysis of tissue samples after f-AuNP NIMS shows a distinct ""raising"" of the surface as compared to matrix assisted laser desorption ionization ablation, indicative of a gentle desorption mechanism aiding in the generation of intact molecular ions. Moreover, the use of perfluorohexane to distribute the f-AuNPs on the tissue creates a hydrophobic environment minimizing metabolite solubilization and spatial dislocation. The transfer of the energy from the incident laser to the analytes through the release of the fluorocarbon chains similarly enhances the desorption/ionization of metabolites of different chemical nature, resulting in heterogeneous metabolome coverage. We performed the approach in a comparative study of the colon of mice exposed to three different diets. F-AuNP NIMS allows the direct detection of carbohydrates, lipids, bile acids, sulfur metabolites, amino acids, nucleotide precursors as well as other small molecules of varied biological origins. Ultimately, the diversified molecular coverage obtained provides a broad picture of a tissue's metabolic organization. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",fiber free diet; gut microbiome; mass spectrometry imaging; metabolomics; mice; nanostructure imaging mass spectrometry; perfluorinated gold nanoparticles,"Biomolecules; Chains; Chemical analysis; Desorption; Fiber optic sensors; Fluorocarbons; Gold nanoparticles; Metabolites; Metal nanoparticles; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Comprehensive analysis; Desorption/ionization; Electron microscopy analysis; Hydrophobic environment; Imaging mass spectrometry; Laser desorption/ionization; Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization; Nucleotide precursors; Tissue; amino acid; bile acid; carbohydrate; gold; lipid; nanomaterial; nucleotide; sulfur; animal; Bacteroides fragilis; C57BL mouse; chemistry; colon; cytology; fluorescence imaging; halogenation; isolation and purification; mass spectrometry; metabolism; mouse; Amino Acids; Animals; Bacteroides fragilis; Bile Acids and Salts; Carbohydrates; Colon; Gold; Halogenation; Lipids; Mass Spectrometry; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Nanostructures; Nucleotides; Optical Imaging; Sulfur",American Chemical Society
"Isolation, Identification, and Biodegradation Behaviors of a Perfluorooctane Sulfonic Acid Precursor (PreFOSs) Degrading Bacterium from Contaminated Soil [PFOS前体物质(PreFOSs)降解菌的分离鉴定及其降解特性]","Zhao S.-Y., Zhou T., Wang B.-H., Liang T.-K., Liu L.-F.",2018,Huanjing Kexue/Environmental Science,"Transformation of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) precursors (PreFOSs) is considered an additional source of PFOS in the environment and biota. A PreFOSs-degrading bacterium PF1, which was able to utilize PreFOSs as the sole carbon and energy source for growth, was isolated from contaminated soil collected from the surroundings of a fluoride factory. According to its morphology and 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis, strain PF1 was identified as Hyphomicrobium sp. The degradation rates of perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA) and N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide (N-EtFOSA) by PF1 were 14.6% and 8.2% (30℃; pH=7.0-7.2), respectively, whereas PF1 was unable to degrade PFOS. PFOSA could be biodegraded to PFOS. N-EtFOSA could be biodegraded to perfluorooctane sulfonamide acetic acid (FOSAA), PFOSA, and PFOS; PFOS was the predominant metabolite. Based on the above analysis, the proposed metabolic pathway of PFOSA by strain PF1 is deamination to form PFOS. Two possible degradation pathways are proposed for N-EtFOSA: ① deethylation of N-EtFOSA to produce PFOSA, followed by deamination to form PFOS, and ②oxidation of N-EtFOSA to FOSAA followed by sequential dealkylation to produce PFOSA, and then transformation to PFOS by deamination. © 2018, Science Press.

Photodegradation of perfluorooctanoic acid by graphene oxide-deposited TiO2 nanotube arrays in aqueous phase,"Park K., Ali I., Kim J.-O.",2018,Journal of Environmental Management,"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a persistent organic pollutant in the environment with serious health risks including endocrine-disrupting characteristics, immunotoxicity, and causing developmental defects. The photocatalytic deposition has proven to be an inexpensive, effective, and sustainable technology for the removal of PFOA in the aqueous phase. Most investigations are conducted in ultrapure water at concentrations higher than those detected in actual water systems. A few studies deal with the toxicity of treated water. In this research, the photocatalytic degradation of PFOA, including photo-oxidative and photo-reductive degradation, is reviewed comprehensively. Compared to photo-oxidation, photo-reduction is more suitable for PFOA removal since it favors defluorination of PFOA and complete mineralization. We used graphene oxide/TiO2 nanotubes array for photocatalytic degradation of PFOA. The effects of key parameters on the photocatalytic degradation and defluorination processes of PFOA, such as initial PFOA concentration, initial pH of the solution, an initial temperature of the solution, and external bias constant potential, are addressed. We observed that at pH 3 the PFOA degradation was around 83% in 4 h, and at 75 °C almost complete PFOA degradation was observed in 2.5 h. In photoelectrocatalytic process at 2.0 V external bias 97% of PFOA was degraded in 4 h. The mechanisms of the PFOA photodegradation process are also discussed in detail. © 2018",GO/TNA composites; PFOA; Photodegradation; UV irradiation,graphene oxide; nanotube; perfluorooctanoic acid; titanium dioxide nanoparticle; water; fluorocarbon; graphite; octanoic acid derivative; oxide; perfluorooctanoic acid; titanium; titanium dioxide; aqueous solution; catalysis; chemical compound; concentration (composition); health risk; inorganic compound; organic pollutant; oxidation; photodegradation; pollutant removal; reduction; temperature effect; toxicity; ultraviolet radiation; aqueous solution; Article; concentration (parameters); defluorination; degradation kinetics; oxidation reduction reaction; photocatalysis; photodegradation; photooxidation; temperature; ultraviolet irradiation; water supply; catalysis; chemistry; photolysis; Caprylates; Catalysis; Fluorocarbons; Graphite; Nanotubes; Oxides; Photolysis; Titanium,Academic Press
Endocrine-disrupting chemicals and risk of diabetes: an evidence-based review,"Lind P.M., Lind L.",2018,Diabetologia,"The purpose of this study was to review the epidemiological and experimental evidence linking background exposure to a selection of environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with diabetes and impaired glucose metabolism. The review summarises the literature on both cross-sectional and prospective studies in humans, as well as experimental in vivo and in vitro studies. The findings were subjected to evidence grading according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) classification. We found >40 cross-sectional and seven prospective studies regarding EDCs and risk of diabetes. Taken together, there is moderate evidence for a relationship between exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE), a metabolite of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, and diabetes development. Regarding polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), it is likely that the rodent models used are not appropriate, and therefore the evidence is poorer than for p,p′-DDE. For other EDCs, such as bisphenol A, phthalates and perfluorinated chemicals, the evidence is scarce, since very few prospective studies exist. Brominated flame retardants do not seem to be associated with a disturbed glucose tolerance. Thus, evidence is accumulating that EDCs might be involved in diabetes development. Best evidence exists for p,p′-DDE. For other chemicals, both prospective studies and supporting animal data are still lacking. © 2018, The Author(s).",Bisphenol A; BPA; Chemicals; DDE; DDT; Diabetes; EDCs; Endocrine-disrupting chemicals; Pesticides; Review,"1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; endocrine disruptor; flame retardant; glucose; perfluoro compound; phthalic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; benzhydryl derivative; chlorphenotane; endocrine disruptor; phenol derivative; diabetes mellitus; environmental exposure; evidence based practice; experimental study; glucose metabolism; glucose tolerance; human; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; Review; risk factor; animal; diabetes mellitus; glucose tolerance test; Animals; Benzhydryl Compounds; DDT; Diabetes Mellitus; Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene; Endocrine Disruptors; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; Phenols",Springer Verlag
Potential roles of acyl homoserine lactone based quorum sensing in sequencing batch nitrifying biofilm reactors with or without the addition of organic carbon,"Sun Y., Guan Y., Wang D., Liang K., Wu G.",2018,Bioresource Technology,"Two lab-scale nitrifying sequencing batch biofilm reactors, with (SBBR_CN) or without the addition of organics (SBBR_N), were operated to investigate potential roles of acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) based quorum sensing. AHLs of N-[(RS)-3-Hydroxybutyryl]-L-homoserine lactone, N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C6-HSL) and N-octanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C8-HSL) were detected in both reactors. C6-HSL and C8-HSL were also detected in batch experiments, especially with stimulated nitrite oxidizing bacteria activities. Quorum sensing affected biofilm formation mainly through the regulation of extracellular protein production. By the metagenomics analysis, many identified genera and species could participate in quorum sensing, quorum quenching and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production. A high quorum quenching activity was obtained in SBBR_CN, whereas a high quorum sensing activity in SBBR_N. Nitrosomonas-like ammonia oxidizing bacteria, Nitrospira-like nitrite oxidizing bacteria and Comammox harbored genes for AHL synthesis and EPS production.

Antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes in global lakes: A review and meta-analysis,"Yang Y., Song W., Lin H., Wang W., Du L., Xing W.",2018,Environment International,"Lakes are an important source of freshwater, containing nearly 90% of the liquid surface fresh water worldwide. Long retention times in lakes mean pollutants from discharges slowly circulate around the lakes and may lead to high ecological risk for ecosystem and human health. In recent decades, antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been regarded as emerging pollutants. The occurrence and distribution of antibiotics and ARGs in global freshwater lakes are summarized to show the pollution level of antibiotics and ARGs and to identify some of the potential risks to ecosystem and human health. Fifty-seven antibiotics were reported at least once in the studied lakes. Our meta-analysis shows that sulfamethoxazole, sulfamerazine, sulfameter, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, erythromycin, and roxithromycin were found at high concentrations in both lake water and lake sediment. There is no significant difference in the concentration of sulfonamides in lake water from China and that from other countries worldwide; however, there was a significant difference in quinolones. Erythromycin had the lowest predicted hazardous concentration for 5% of the species (HC5) and the highest ecological risk in lakes. There was no significant difference in the concentration of sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1 and sul2) in lake water and river water. There is surprisingly limited research on the role of aquatic biota in propagation of ARGs in freshwater lakes. As an environment that is susceptible to cumulative build-up of pollutants, lakes provide an important environment to study the fate of antibiotics and transport of ARGs with a broad range of niches including bacterial community, aquatic plants and animals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Antibiotic resistance genes; Antibiotics; Aquatic biota; Meta-analysis; Niche; Species sensitivity distributions,"Amides; Antibiotics; Aquatic organisms; Ecosystems; Genes; Health risks; Lakes; River pollution; Sulfur compounds; Water; Antibiotic resistance genes; Aquatic biota; Meta analysis; Niche; Species sensitivity distributions; Lake pollution; antibiotic agent; erythromycin; lake water; lincosamide; macrolide; oxytetracycline; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; river water; roxithromycin; sulfamerazine; sulfamethoxazole; sulfametoxydiazine; sulfonamide; tetracycline; trimethoprim derivative; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; antibiotics; biota; lake pollution; meta-analysis; sensitivity analysis; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance gene; China; concentration (parameters); ecology; ecosystem; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; gene; geographic distribution; health hazard; lake; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; sediment; sul1 gene; sul2 gene; systematic review; water analysis; water pollution; analysis; antibiotic resistance; bacterial gene; bacterium; chemistry; drug effect; genetics; meta analysis; microbiology; China; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Genes, Bacterial; Geologic Sediments; Lakes",Elsevier Ltd
Comparing surgical interventions for intertrochanteric hip fracture by blood loss and operation time: A network meta-analysis,"Hao Z., Wang X., Zhang X.",2018,Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research,"Background: Multiple operative treatments are available for the fixation of intertrochanteric femoral fractures. This analysis was conducted to provide guidance on the appropriate clinical choice to accommodate individual patients. Methods: A systematic review was performed to identify relevant articles in databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with intertrochanteric femoral fractures were eligible if they compared 2 or more of the following interventions: proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA), percutaneous compression plate (PCCP) use, dynamic hip screw (DHS) fixation, gamma nail (GN) fixation, and artificial femoral head replacement (FHR). Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to simultaneously compare all treatment methods. Results: In total, 24 active-comparator studies involving 3097 participants were identified. Across all populations, greater reductions in blood loss and operation time were observed for PFNA than for other treatments. In terms of bleeding, more blood loss was observed for DHS use than for the PFNA (SMD, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.01-1.96), PCCP (SMD, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.31-2.20), and GN (SMD, 0.26; 95% CI, - 0.35-0.87) techniques. However, a more beneficial effect was observed for DHS use than for FHR (SMD, - 0.23; 95% CI, - 1.26-0.81). DHS use resulted in a significantly longer duration of operation time than the PFNA (SMD, 0.75; 95% CI, - 0.02-0.75), PCCP (SMD, 0.61; 95% CI, - 0.20-1.44), and GN (SMD, 0.25; 95% CI, - 0.26-0.77) techniques. Similarly, greater reductions in operation time were observed for DHS use than for FHR (SMD, - 0.12; 95% CI, - 1.15-0.91). Conclusions: The findings provide supporting evidence demonstrating the superiority of PFNA over other treatments for intertrochanteric femoral fracture. PFNA treatment results in the lowest amount of blood loss and the shortest operation time. These findings add to the existing knowledge of intertrochanteric femoral fracture treatment options. © 2018 The Author(s).",Intertrochanteric hip fracture; Meta-analysis; Surgical intervention,"Bayes theorem; comparative study; devices; hip fracture; human; meta analysis; network meta-analysis; operation duration; operative blood loss; osteosynthesis; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); treatment outcome; Bayes Theorem; Blood Loss, Surgical; Fracture Fixation, Internal; Hip Fractures; Humans; Network Meta-Analysis; Operative Time; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome",BioMed Central Ltd.
Recent technical and biological development in the analysis of biomarker N-deoxyguanosine-C8-4-aminobiphenyl,"Chen Z., Zhang Y., Vouros P.",2018,Journal of Chromatography B: Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical and Life Sciences,"4-Aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) which is primarily formed during tobacco combustion and overheated meat is a major carcinogen responsible for various cancers. Its adducted form, N-deoxyguanosine-C8-4-aminobiphenyl (dG-C8-4-ABP), has long been employed as a biomarker for assessment of the risk for cancer. In this review, the metabolism and carcinogenisity of 4-ABP will be discussed, followed by a discussion of the current common approaches of analyzing dG-C8-4-ABP. The major part of this review will be on the history and recent development of key methods for detection and quantitation of dG-C8-4-ABP in complex biological samples and their biological applications, from the traditional 2P-postlabelling and immunoassay methods to modern liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with the latter as the focus. Many vital biological discoveries based on dG-C8-4-ABP have been published by using the nanoLC-MS with column switching platform in our laboratory, which has also been adopted and further improved by many other researchers. We hope this review can provide a perspective of the challenges that had to be addressed in reaching our present goals and possibly bring new ideas for those who are still working on the frontline of DNA adducts area. © 2018",4-Aminobiphenyl; Bladder cancer; dG-C8-4-ABP; DNA adducts; LC-MS,"Biomarkers; Biomolecules; Diseases; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; 4-Aminobiphenyl; Bladder cancers; dG-C8-4-ABP; DNA adducts; LC-MS; Risk assessment; 4 biphenylamine; DNA; n deoxyguanosine c8 4 aminobiphenyl; oligonucleotide; phosphorus 32; unclassified drug; 4-biphenylamine; 8-nitro-2'-deoxyguanosine; aminobiphenyl derivative; biological marker; deoxyguanosine; bladder cancer; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; DNA adduct; human; immunoassay; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; malignant neoplasm; mass fragmentography; metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; analogs and derivatives; animal; limit of detection; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; microfluidic analysis; mouse; occupational exposure; procedures; statistical model; tissue distribution; Aminobiphenyl Compounds; Animals; Biomarkers; Chromatography, Liquid; Deoxyguanosine; Humans; Limit of Detection; Linear Models; Mass Spectrometry; Mice; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques; Occupational Exposure; Tissue Distribution",Elsevier B.V.
Mechanisms underpinning the polypharmacy effects of medications in psychiatry,"Bortolasci C.C., Spolding B., Callaly E., Martin S., Panizzutti B., Kidnapillai S., Connor T., Hasebe K., Mohebbi M., Dean O.M., McGee S.L., Dodd S., Gray L., Berk M., Walder K.",2018,International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Background: Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition with progressive social and cognitive function disturbances. Most patients’ treatments are based on polypharmacy, but with no biological basis and little is known of the drugs’ interactions. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of lithium, valproate, quetiapine, and lamotrigine, and the interactions between them, on markers of inflammation, bioenergetics, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress in neuron-like cells and microglial cells. Methods: Neuron-like cells and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated C8-B4 cells were treated with lithium (2.5 mM), valproate (0.5 mM), quetiapine (0.05 mM), and lamotrigine (0.05 mM) individually and in all possible combinations for 24 h. Twenty cytokines were measured in the media from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated C8-B4 cells. Metabolic flux analysis was used to measure bioenergetics, and real-time PCR was used to measure the expression of mitochondrial function genes in neuron-like cells. The production of superoxide in treated cells was also assessed. Results: The results suggest major inhibitory effects on proinflammatory cytokine release as a therapeutic mechanism of these medications when used in combination. The various combinations of medications also caused overexpression of PGC1α and ATP5A1 in neuron-like cells. Quetiapine appears to have a proinflammatory effect in microglial cells, but this was reversed by the addition of lamotrigine independent of the drug combination. Conclusion: Polypharmacy in bipolar disorder may have antiinflammatory effects on microglial cells as well as effects on mitochondrial biogenesis in neuronal cells. © The Author(s) 2018.

Breastfeeding as a Predictor of Serum Concentrations of Per- and Polyfluorinated Alkyl Substances in Reproductive-Aged Women and Young Children: A Rapid Systematic Review,"VanNoy B.N., Lam J., Zota A.R.",2018,Current environmental health reports,"Purpose of review: Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) are synthetic chemicals widely detected in human serum, and at low levels in breast milk. We conducted a rapid systematic review on breastfeeding practices and serum concentrations of PFASs—specifically PFOS and PFOA—among reproductive-aged women and young children using the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology. Recent findings: We included 14 studies examining associations between breastfeeding and PFASs in infants/toddlers or pregnant/postnatal women. Breastfeeding was significantly associated with lower PFASs exposure among women and higher PFASs exposure among children. Summary: We concluded there was “sufficient” evidence supporting an association between breastfeeding and serum PFASs concentrations among women, and “limited” evidence of an association among children due to issues with sample size, confounding, and exposure assessment. These findings reinforce that lactation is an important excretion route of PFASs for women, and that breast milk may be an important exposure pathway for young children. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Breastfeeding; Environmental chemicals; Maternal and child health; Navigation Guide systematic review; PFASs; Prenatal exposures,"alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; adult; analysis; blood; breast feeding; breast milk; environmental exposure; female; human; infant; metabolism; pregnancy; Adult; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Breast Feeding; Environmental Exposure; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Infant; Milk, Human; Pregnancy",Springer
Analytical challenges to determine emerging persistent organic pollutants in aquatic ecosystems,"Lorenzo M., Campo J., Picó Y.",2018,TrAC - Trends in Analytical Chemistry,"Emerging persistent organic pollutants (ePOPs) include polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride/perfluorooctane sulfonate (POSF/PFOS), which are newly listed in the Stockholm Convention. Other ePOPs, which have not been regulated, include organophosphate flame retardants (PFRs), novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) and other perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Often ePOPs data related to occurrence, toxicity, impact or environmental behavior are insufficient or inadequate because of the lack of proper analytical methods to obtain them. Thus, a critical review of the analytical procedures proposed in the last six years (2011–2017) for determining ePOPs by chromatographic methods in the different compartments of the aquatic ecosystems is presented.

Off-line solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the quantitation of brivaracetam acid metabolites: Method validation and application to in vitro metabolism assays,"Bourgogne E., Culot B., Dell'Aiera S., Chanteux H., Stockis A., Nicolas J.-M.",2018,Journal of Chromatography B: Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical and Life Sciences,"Brivaracetam (BRV) is a new high affinity synaptic vesicle protein 2A ligand recently approved for adults with partial-onset seizures. As a support to in vitro metabolism assays, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method coupled to off-line solid phase extraction (SPE) was developed to quantify BRV acid metabolites, that is, BRV-AC (carboxylic derivative derived from BRV hydrolysis) and BRV-OHAC (corresponding to hydroxylated BRV-AC). The method was validated for various incubates (liver and kidney tissue homogenates and blood, all from humans) and applied to in vitro metabolism assays. The analytes were isolated from buffered samples using ISOLUTE C8 96-well SPE plates. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Waters Atlantis T3 C18 analytical column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 5 μm) with detection accomplished using a Waters Premier tandem mass spectrometer in positive ion electrospray and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The standard curves, which ranged from 1.00 to 200 ng/mL for BRV-AC, BRV-OHAC, were fitted to a 1/x2 weighted linear regression model. The intra-assay precision and inter-assay precision (expressed as coefficient of variation -%CV) were &lt;8.5%, and the assay accuracy (deviation - %Dev) was within ±7.1% for the different matrices. This accurate, precise, and selective SPE/LC–MS/MS method has been successfully applied to in vitro assays aimed at characterizing the kinetics of BRV hydrolysis. BRV was found to be a better substrate for hydrolysis than its hydroxylated metabolite BRV-OH. BRV hydrolysis was detected in blood, liver and kidneys, demonstrating the broad distribution of the enzyme catalyzing the reaction. © 2018",Antiepileptic drug; Bioanalysis; Brivaracetam; LC-MS/MS,"Assays; Biomolecules; Blood; Drug products; Hydrolysis; Hydroxylation; Linear regression; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Metabolites; Phase separation; Positive ions; Antiepileptic drugs; Bioanalysis; Brivaracetam; LC-MS/MS; Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS); Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Multiple-reaction monitoring modes; Off-line solid phase extraction; Extraction; brivaracetam; 2 pyrrolidone derivative; brivaracetam; Article; blood; chromatography; ethnic group; human; human tissue; hydrolysis; ionization; kidney; kidney homogenate; kinetic parameters; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liver; liver microsome; multiple reaction monitoring; positive ion electrospray; priority journal; quality control; room temperature; solid phase extraction; chemistry; cytology; isolation and purification; limit of detection; liquid chromatography; metabolism; procedures; reproducibility; solid phase extraction; statistical model; tandem mass spectrometry; Chromatography, Liquid; Humans; Hydrolysis; Kidney; Limit of Detection; Linear Models; Microsomes, Liver; Pyrrolidinones; Reproducibility of Results; Solid Phase Extraction; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Elsevier B.V.
The impact of fast track protocols in upper gastrointestinal surgery: A meta-analysis of observational studies,"Siotos C., Stergios K., Naska A., Frountzas M., Pergialiotis V., Perrea D.N., Nikiteas N.",2018,Surgeon,"Background: Fast track surgery has been implemented in colorectal procedures during the last decade and is accompanied by significant improvement in patient outcomes during the early postoperative period. However, to date, its adoption in upper gastrointestinal surgery remains a matter of debate. In this context, we aimed to summarize the existing evidence in the international literature. Materials and methods: We searched Medline, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Central Register databases for published randomized controlled trials. The meta-analysis was performed with the RevMan 5.3.5 software. Main findings: Thirty studies were finally included in the present meta-analysis. The post-operative morbidity was not influenced by the implementation of fast track surgery (FTS) (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64–1.09). However, in cases treated with laparoscopic surgery fast track surgery seemed to reduce morbidity by 50% (p =.006). The overall mortality of patients was low in the majority of included studies and was not influenced by fast track surgery (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.50–2.52). The duration of postoperative hospitalization was significantly reduced with the adoption of FTS (MD −2.24, 95% CI −2.63 to −1.85 days). Concurrently, the overall cost was significantly reduced in cases treated with FTS (MD −982.30, 95% CI −1367.68 to −596.91 U.S dollars). Conclusion: According to the findings of our meta-analysis suggest that FTS seems to be safe in patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal surgery and reduce both the days of postoperative hospitalization and the overall cost. This observation should be taken into account in future recommendations to enhance the implementation of FTS protocols in current clinical practice. © 2017 Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (Scottish charity number SC005317) and Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland",ERAS; Fast track surgery; Postoperative morbidity; Upper gastrointestinal,abdominal surgery; clinical protocol; human; laparoscopy; meta analysis; observational study; perioperative period; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); standards; surgery; time factor; upper gastrointestinal tract; Clinical Protocols; Digestive System Surgical Procedures; Humans; Laparoscopy; Observational Studies as Topic; Perioperative Care; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Time Factors; Upper Gastrointestinal Tract,Elsevier Ltd
Overview of air pollution and endocrine disorders,Darbre P.D.,2018,International Journal of General Medicine,"Over recent years, many environmental pollutant chemicals have been shown to possess the ability to interfere in the functioning of the endocrine system and have been termed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). These compounds exist in air as volatile or semi-volatile compounds in the gas phase or attached to particulate matter. They include components of plastics (phthalates, bisphenol A), components of consumer goods (parabens, triclosan, alkylphenols, fragrance compounds, organobromine flame retardants, fluorosurfactants), industrial chemicals (polychlorinated biphenyls), products of combustion (polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/furans, polyaromatic hydrocarbons), pesticides, herbicides, and some metals.

Assessing the Significance of Hexafluorobenzene as a Unique Guest Agent through Stacking Interactions in Substituted Ethynylphenyl Benzamides,"Bhandary S., Chopra D.",2018,Crystal Growth and Design,"A series of differently substituted host molecules have been employed to systematically investigate the nature and strength of the stacking interactions with hexafluorobenzene in the solid state. The hexafluorobenzene guest binds to the crystal lattice of the parent compound, the N-ethynylphenyl benzamide host and its nine other halogenated (-F/-CF3/-Cl/-Br at ortho/meta/para positions individually) analogues via stacking of aromatic rings. The geometrical and energetic features of intermolecular interactions in host-guest molecules have been investigated, and the results elucidate the dominancy of dispersion in the stabilization of the aryl-hexafluorobenzene stacking, while the electrostatic component also plays an important role. The plots of the molecular electrostatic potential provide a fundamental basis of the electrostatic complementarity that exists in between the host and the guest. The topological characterization reveals unambiguous evidence for the direct participation of the substituents in closed-shell bonding interactions with the aromatic rings at the local geometry, which remarkably controls the nature and energetics of such motifs. Additionally, the observed upfield 19F NMR chemical shifts for perfluorinated guest upon complexation with the host compounds provide evidence for the existence of the host-guest stacking interaction also in the solution state. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,Amides; Aromatic compounds; Chemical bonds; Molecules; Closed-shell bonding; Electrostatic components; Hexafluorobenzene; Host-guest molecules; Intermolecular interactions; Molecular electrostatic potentials; Parent compounds; Stacking interaction; Electrostatics,American Chemical Society
Association between perfluoroalkyl substances exposure and thyroid function in adults: A meta-analysis,"Kim M.J., Moon S., Oh B.-C., Jung D., Ji K., Choi K., Park Y.J.",2018,PLoS ONE,"Objective Many people are exposed to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) because these substances are widely used as industrial products. Although epidemiological studies suggest that PFASs can disrupt thyroid hormones, the association between PFAS exposure and thyroid function remains inconclusive. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and thyroid hormones. Methods We searched medical literature databases for articles on the association between PFASs–perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS)–and thyroid hormone levels in adults. Twelve articles were included in the meta-analysis, and the pooled z values were calculated with correlation or regression coefficients. Results The blood PFOS concentration was positively correlated with free T4. The pooled z value was 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03, 0.08). PFOS was negatively correlated with total T4 and total T3 when excluding outlier studies. In a subgroup analysis stratified by mean PFOS concentration, PFOS was observed to be positively associated with free T4 and TSH and negatively associated with total T3 in the intermediate concentration group (8–16 ng/mL). PFOA concentration was negatively correlated with total T4 (z value, -0.06; 95% CI: -0.09, -0.03) after omitting one outlier study. PFHxS also showed a negative correlation with total T4 (z value, -0.04; 95% CI: -0.07, -0.01). A subgroup analysis of pregnant women showed that there was no association between PFASs and thyroid hormones. Conclusions Our meta-analysis suggests that PFASs are negatively associated with total T4, and their effect can be different depending on the PFAS concentration. © 2018 Kim et al.

Network meta-analysis of surgical treatment for unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures,"Wang H.-H., Shu W.-B., Lan G.-H., Zhang X.-B., Jiang Z., Xu D.-H., Bao X.-X., Li A.-B.",2018,Oncotarget,"In this network meta-analysis, we determined the optimal surgical method for treating unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures. We searched the EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Medline databases for studies evaluating sliding hip screws (SHS), gamma nail (GN) or proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) methods, and included nine randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis showed no differences in the rates of complications between SHS and PFNA relative to GN (p > 0.05). However, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) score for PFNA (77.6%) was higher than the SUCRA scores for GN (65%) and SHS (7.5%). This suggests PFNA is the better surgical method than GN or SHS for unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures. © Wang et al.",Gamma nail; Network meta-analysis; Proximal femoral nail antirotation; Sliding hip screws; Unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures,Article; complication rate; femur intertrochanteric fracture; gamma nail; human; intermethod comparison; meta analysis; orthodontic surgery; postoperative complication; proximal femoral nail antirotation; risk factor; scoring system; sliding hip screw; surface under the cumulative ranking curve; surgical risk; systematic review,Impact Journals LLC
Optimisation of protocol for effective detachment and selective recovery of the representative bacteria for extraction of metagenomic DNA from Eucalyptus spp. woodchips,"Nnadozie C.F., Lin J., Govinden R.",2018,Journal of Microbiological Methods,"For some environments such as planktonic/aqueous environments, the separation of bacteria cells from eukaryotic cells prior to DNA extraction using filtration is relatively straightforward. However, for woodchips, the bacteria are attached/embedded within the wood matrix, which prevents easy removal of bacterial cells. In this study, a method for the selective extraction of DNA from bacteria inhabiting Eucalyptus spp. woodchips has been developed. The objective was to compare milled and unmilled woodchips processed via three detachment methods, viz., sonication, vortexing and shaking followed by filtration using Teflon filters according to three relevant criteria: DNA yield, DNA purity and quality of DNA. Highest DNA yield was obtained by milling and vortexing for 10 min (77.50 ± 5.17 ng/μl), followed by milling and vortexing for 2 min (61.00 ± 6.56 ng/μl), unmilled and vortexing for 10 min (38.67 ± 5.17 ng/μl) and milled and shaking for 2 h (31.62 ± 5.17 ng/μl). The lowest DNA yield was obtained by using unmilled woodchips and 5 min of sonication treatment (7.00 ± 1.22 ng/μl). There was no significant difference in DNA purity for milled or unmilled woodchips processed via the three detachment methods. Duration of cell detachment treatment did not significantly influence DNA yield and purity. Following optimisation experiments, it was possible to extract bacterial DNA using milled woodchips and 10 minute vortexing devoid of DNA from the host background and other associated eukaryotes and of sufficient quality and quantity for metagenomic analysis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Bacteria; Detachment; DNA; Metagenomic; Woodchips,"bacterial DNA; RNA 16S; RNA 18S; bacterial DNA; agar gel electrophoresis; analytical parameters; Article; bacterial cell; bacterium isolation; cell detachment; comparative study; controlled study; DNA extraction; DNA purity; DNA quality; DNA yield; Eucalyptus; filtration; metagenomics; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; procedures concerning cells; process optimization; shaking; ultrasound; vortexing; wood chip; bacterium; classification; Eucalyptus; evaluation study; genetics; isolation and purification; mechanical stress; microbiology; procedures; wood; Bacteria; DNA, Bacterial; Eucalyptus; Filtration; Metagenomics; Sonication; Stress, Mechanical; Wood",Elsevier B.V.
A critical review of the application of polymer of low concern and regulatory criteria to fluoropolymers,"Henry B.J., Carlin J.P., Hammerschmidt J.A., Buck R.C., Buxton L.W., Fiedler H., Seed J., Hernandez O.",2018,Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of fluorinated substances that are in the focus of researchers and regulators due to widespread presence in the environment and biota, including humans, of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Fluoropolymers, high molecular weight polymers, have unique properties that constitute a distinct class within the PFAS group. Fluoropolymers have thermal, chemical, photochemical, hydrolytic, oxidative, and biological stability. They have negligible residual monomer and oligomer content and low to no leachables. Fluoropolymers are practically insoluble in water and not subject to long-range transport. With a molecular weight well over 100 000 Da, fluoropolymers cannot cross the cell membrane. Fluoropolymers are not bioavailable or bioaccumulative, as evidenced by toxicology studies on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE): acute and subchronic systemic toxicity, irritation, sensitization, local toxicity on implantation, cytotoxicity, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity, hemolysis, complement activation, and thrombogenicity. Clinical studies of patients receiving permanently implanted PTFE cardiovascular medical devices demonstrate no chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity and no reproductive, developmental, or endocrine toxicity. This paper brings together fluoropolymer toxicity data, human clinical data, and physical, chemical, thermal, and biological data for review and assessment to show that fluoropolymers satisfy widely accepted assessment criteria to be considered as “polymers of low concern” (PLC). This review concludes that fluoropolymers are distinctly different from other polymeric and nonpolymeric PFAS and should be separated from them for hazard assessment or regulatory purposes. Grouping fluoropolymers with all classes of PFAS for “read across” or structure–activity relationship assessment is not scientifically appropriate.

Orange juice affects acylcarnitine metabolism in healthy volunteers as revealed by a mass-spectrometry based metabolomics approach,"Moreira V., Brasili E., Fiamoncini J., Marini F., Miccheli A., Daniel H., Lee J.J.H., Hassimotto N.M.A., Lajolo F.M.",2018,Food Research International,"Citrus juices, especially orange juice, constitute rich sources of bioactive compounds with a wide range of health-promoting activities. Data from epidemiological and in vitro studies suggest that orange juice (OJ) may have a positive impact on lipid metabolism. However, the effect of orange juice intake on blood lipid profile is still poorly understood. We have used two different blood samples, Dried Blood Spots (DBS) and plasma, to assess the effect of two-week orange juice consumption in healthy volunteers by a mass-spectrometry based metabolomics approach. DBS were analysed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and plasma samples were analysed by the gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS). One hundred sixty-nine lipids including acylcarnitines (AC), lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPC), (diacyl- and acyl-alkyl-) phosphatidylcholines (PC aa and PC ae) and sphingomyelins (SM) were identified and quantified in DBS. Eighteen fatty acids were identified and quantified in plasma. Multivariate analysis allowed to identify an increase in C3:1, C5-DC(C6-OH), C5-M-DC, C5:1-DC, C8, C12-DC, lysoPC18:3, myristic acid, pentadecanoic acid, palmitoleic and palmitic acid and a decrease in nervonic acid, C0, C2, C10, C10:1, C16:1, C16-OH, C16:1-OH, C18-OH, PC aa C40:4, PC ae C38:4, PC ae C42:3, PC ae C42:4 and cholesterol levels after orange juice intake. A two-week period of orange juice intake could affect fatty acids β-oxidation through mitochondrial and peroxisomal pathways, leading to an increase of short-chain acylcarnitines and a decrease of medium and long-chain acylcarnitines. This is the first report analyzing the effect of orange juice intake in healthy volunteers using a dried blood spot-based metabolomics approach. © 2018",Acylcarnitines; Dried blood spots; GC–MS; LC-MS; Orange juice; Phosphatidycholines; Targeted metabolic profile,"Blood; Chains; Chromatography; Citrus fruits; Fatty acids; Gas chromatography; Lipids; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Multivariant analysis; Palmitic acid; Physiology; Saturated fatty acids; Spectrometry; Acylcarnitines; Dried blood spots; LC-MS; Metabolic profiles; Orange juice; Phosphatidycholines; Fruit juices; acylcarnitine; carnitine; adult; blood; female; fruit and vegetable juice; human; liquid chromatography; male; mass fragmentography; mass spectrometry; metabolism; metabolomics; middle aged; procedures; reference value; sweet orange; young adult; Adult; Carnitine; Chromatography, Liquid; Citrus sinensis; Female; Fruit and Vegetable Juices; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Humans; Male; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolomics; Middle Aged; Reference Values; Young Adult",Elsevier Ltd
A pilot data analysis of a metabolomic HPLC-MS/MS study of patients with COPD,"Novotna B., Abdel-Hamid M., Koblizek V., Svoboda M., Hejduk K., Rehacek V., Bis J., Salajka F.",2018,Advances in Clinical and Experimental Medicine,"Background. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous condition with multiple clinical faces. Metabolomic profling studies small molecules present in biological samples by combined use of chromatography with mass spectrometry. Objectives. The goal of our work was to perform a high performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) metabolomic study to compare the concentrations of metabolites in COPD patients and in controls. Material and methods. Participants were recruited at the University Hospital, Hradec Králové, Czech Republic, with the approval of the ethics committee. The analysis of blood samples was performed at Health Sciences Center (HSC) in Kuwait. The blood samples were analyzed for concentrations of acylcarnitines and amino acids by high performance liquid chromatography (Waters 2690 HPLC; Waters, Milford, USA) and a triple-quadruple tandem mass spectrometer (Quattro LC, Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom). Results. Groups of 10 subjects with COPD and 10 healthy controls were analyzed. Carnitine analysis showed that the free carnitine to acylcarnitine ratio (C0/AC ratio) was signifcantly lower in COPD (0.58 μM/L) compared to the controls (0.73 μM/L; p = 0.002). The mean C8/C2 ratio in the COPD group was signifcantly higher (0.03 μM/L)-in the control group it was 0 μM/L (p = 0.03). Amino acid analysis showed lower levels of phenylalanine in the COPD group (22.05 μM/L) compared to the controls (30.05 μM/L; p = 0.008). The alanine concentrations were signifcantly lower in the COPD group (173 μM/L) than in the control group (253 μM/L; p = 0.001). The pyroglutamate levels were higher in COPD (1.58 μM/L) than in the controls (1 μM/L; p = 0.040). Conclusions. The carnitine and acylcarnitine levels in COPD subjects in this study possibly indicate a predisposition to atherosclerosis as a result of inadequate β-oxidation of fatty acids and show the presence of oxidative stress. Furthermore, the high sensitivity to changes in circulating amino acid levels may allow us to detect subclinical malnutrition and take early preventative interventions such as nutritional supplementation and patient education. © 2018 by Wroclaw Medical University.",Amino acids; Carnitine; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Metabolomics,"acylcarnitine; alanine; amino acid; carnitine; phenylalanine; pyroglutamic acid; acylcarnitine; amino acid; carnitine; adult; amino acid analysis; amino acid blood level; Article; body mass; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical article; controlled study; disease predisposition; disease severity; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; high performance liquid chromatography; human; male; metabolomics; middle aged; pilot study; tandem mass spectrometry; analogs and derivatives; blood; case control study; chronic obstructive lung disease; data analysis; high performance liquid chromatography; metabolism; procedures; tandem mass spectrometry; Amino Acids; Carnitine; Case-Control Studies; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Data Analysis; Humans; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Wroclaw University of Medicine
Drinking water disinfection by-products exposure and health effects on pregnancy outcomes: a systematic review,"Mashau F., Ncube E.J., Voyi K.",2018,Journal of Water and Health,"Epidemiological studies have found that maternal exposure to disinfection by-products (DBPs) may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes although the findings tend to be inconsistent. The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence in associated with drinking water DBP exposure in relation to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Peer-reviewed articles were identified using electronic databases searched for studies published in the English language. Studies selected for review were evaluated for exposure assessment, confounders, and analyses risks of bias in the selection, outcomes assessment, and attrition. A comprehensive search and screening yielded a total of 32 studies, of which 12 (38%) reported a statistical association between maternal exposure to DBPs and adverse pregnancy outcomes. A maternal exposure to trihalomethanes (THMs) shows an increased risk of small for gestational age (SGA) and slightly increased risk of pregnancy loss. Risks of bias were low among the studies included in the review. Evidence on association relating to adverse pregnancy outcomes to DBP exposure is still less significant. There is a need for future robust research in this field, with the use of urinary trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) biomarkers as a direct exposure assessment method for this field. © IWA Publishing 2018.",Adverse pregnancy outcomes; Disinfection by-product exposure; Drinking water,"disinfectant agent; drinking water; haloacetaldehyde; haloacetic acid; haloacetonitrile; organohalogen derivative; trihalomethane; unclassified drug; disinfectant agent; drinking water; trichloroacetic acid; byproduct; database; disinfection; drinking water; epidemiology; health impact; health risk; literature review; maternal health; pollution effect; pollution exposure; pregnancy; disinfection; human; low birth weight; maternal exposure; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; prematurity; Review; risk factor; small for date infant; spontaneous abortion; systematic review; water contamination; analysis; chemistry; disinfection; epidemiology; female; maternal exposure; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; procedures; statistics and numerical data; toxicity; water management; water pollutant; water supply; Disinfectants; Disinfection; Drinking Water; Female; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Trichloroacetic Acid; Trihalomethanes; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification; Water Supply",IWA Publishing
A critical review of the measurement of ice adhesion to solid substrates,"Work A., Lian Y.",2018,Progress in Aerospace Sciences,"Ice adhesion is an issue spanning a wide range of technical fields. In the aerospace industry, ice accretion has led to a large number of casualties and costs the industry billions of dollars every year. To design effective anti-/de-icing systems, the adhesion of ice to surfaces must be understood. In this review paper, the authors surveyed for papers providing methods for the measurement of ice adhesion. 113 papers were identified for comparison, with data being extracted from 58 papers with common test surfaces (aluminum, steel, Teflon® (Chemours), and polyurethane). The methods used were categorized and data were compared based on their precision and the trends they demonstrated. Conceptual problems were identified with the tests used in the literature and discussed, and open questions relevant to testing the adhesion of ice were identified. Several key parameters affecting ice adhesion identified from the literature were temperature, surface roughness, strain rate, and impact velocity. Their effects on adhesion strength were discussed. While researching this topic, it was discovered that many papers did not report the strain rate in their tests, and the vast majority of papers did not correct their data for stress concentrations on the surface, either of which has been shown to cause variation in the data by one order of magnitude. Data compared from the literature typically spanned one to three orders of magnitude. The causes of these variations were discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,Adhesion; Aerospace industry; Ice problems; Paper; Strain rate; Surface roughness; Anti/de-icing; Conceptual problems; Critical review; Impact velocities; Review papers; Solid substrates; Technical fields; Three orders of magnitude; Ice,Elsevier Ltd
Review of the fate and transformation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in landfills,"Hamid H., Li L.Y., Grace J.R.",2018,Environmental Pollution,"A critical review of existing publications is presented i) to summarize the occurrence of various classes of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and their sources in landfills, ii) to identify temporal and geographical trends of PFASs in landfills; iii) to delineate the factors affecting PFASs in landfills; and iv) to identify research gaps and future research directions. Studies have shown that perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are routinely detected in landfill leachate, with short chain (C4-C7) PFAAs being most abundant, possibly indicating their greater mobility, and reflecting the industrial shift towards shorter-chain compounds. Despite its restricted use, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) remains one of the most abundant PFAAs in landfill leachates. Recent studies have also documented the presence of PFAA-precursors (e.g., saturated and unsaturated fluorotelomer carboxylic acids) in landfill leachates at concentrations comparable to, or higher than, the most frequently detected PFAAs. Landfill ambient air also contains elevated concentrations of PFASs, primarily semi-volatile precursors (e.g., fluorotelomer alcohols) compared to upwind control sites, suggesting that landfills are potential sources of atmospheric PFASs. The fate of PFASs inside landfills is controlled by a combination of biological and abiotic processes, with biodegradation releasing most of the PFASs from landfilled waste to leachate. Biodegradation in simulated anaerobic reactors has been found to be closely related to the methanogenic phase. The methane-yielding stage also results in higher pH (>7) of leachates, correlated with higher mobility of PFAAs. Little information exists regarding PFAA-precursors in landfills. To avoid significant underestimation of the total PFAS released from landfills, PFAA-precursors and their degradation products should be determined in future studies. Owing to the semi-volatile nature of some precursor compounds and their degradation products, future studies also need to include landfill gas to clarify degradation pathways and the overall fate of PFASs. Landfill leachate and potentially landfill gas act as secondary environmental sources of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Degradation; Landfill; Leachate; Perfluoroalkyl; Polyfluoroalkyl,"Biodegradation; Biogas; Chains; Degradation; Leachate treatment; Elevated concentrations; Fluorotelomer carboxylic acids; Future research directions; Leachates; Perfluoroalkyl; Polyfluoroalkyl; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Shorter chain compounds; Land fill; alkyl group; carboxylic acid; methane; organophosphate; perfluoroalkyl acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; biodegradation; chemical compound; concentration (composition); element mobility; environmental fate; future prospect; landfill; leachate; methanogenesis; ambient air; atmosphere; biodegradation; biological activity; climate; concentration (parameters); gas waste; industrialization; landfill; landfill leachate; methanogenesis; pH; precursor; Review; bioremediation; chemistry; waste disposal facility; water pollutant; Biodegradation, Environmental; Caprylates; Carboxylic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Waste Disposal Facilities; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier Ltd
Pelvic floor disorders in women with gynecologic malignancies: a systematic review,"Ramaseshan A.S., Felton J., Roque D., Rao G., Shipper A.G., Sanses T.V.D.",2018,International Urogynecology Journal,"Introduction and hypothesis: Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) negatively affect quality of life in the general population, and their prevalence in gynecologic cancer survivors has not been systematically described. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of PFDs in cancer survivors. We hypothesized that the prevalence of PFDs in the gynecologic cancer population would be higher than in the general female population. Methods: We searched PubMed (1809 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) through May 2017. The search combined subject headings, title, and abstract words for gynecologic cancer, PFDs, and prevalence. Any studies evaluating the prevalence of PFDs in gynecologic malignancies were included. Results: A total of 550 articles met the designated search criteria and 31 articles were included in this review. In cervical cancer survivors, before treatment the prevalences of stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) and fecal incontinence (FI) were 24–29%, 8–18% and 6%, respectively, and after treatment the prevalences of SUI, UUI, urinary retention, FI, fecal urge, dyspareunia and vaginal dryness were 4–76%, 4–59%, 0.4–39%, 2–34%, 3–49%, 12–58% and 15–47%, respectively. In uterine cancer survivors, before treatment the prevalences of SUI, UUI and FI were 29–36%, 15–25% and 3%, respectively, and after treatment the prevalences of urinary incontinence (UI) and dyspareunia were 2–44% and 7–39%, respectively. In vulvar cancer survivors, after treatment the prevalences of UI, SUI and FI were 4–32%, 6–20% and 1–20%, respectively. In ovarian cancer survivors, the prevalences of SUI, UUI, prolapse and sexual dysfunction were 32–42%, 15–39%, 17% and 62–75%, respectively. Conclusions: PFDs are prevalent in gynecologic cancer survivors and this is an important area of clinical concern and future research. © 2017, The International Urogynecological Association.",Gynecologic cancer; Pelvic floor disorders; Prevalence; Survivor,"bibliographic database; brachytherapy; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer surgery; cancer survivor; cystovaginal fistula; dyspareunia; endometrium cancer; external beam radiotherapy; feces incontinence; female; female genital tract cancer; female sexual dysfunction; human; hypoactive sexual desire disorder; meta analysis; multimodality cancer therapy; nocturia; ovary cancer; pelvic floor disorder; prevalence; priority journal; quality of life; rectovaginal fistula; rectum hemorrhage; Review; stress incontinence; systematic review; urinary urgency; urine incontinence; urine retention; uterine cervix cancer; uterus cancer; uterus prolapse; vaginal dryness; vulva cancer; complication; female genital tract tumor; pelvic floor disorder; statistics and numerical data; Cancer Survivors; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female; Humans; Pelvic Floor Disorders; Prevalence",Springer London
Heavy and standard silicone oil: intraocular inflammation,"Russo A., Morescalchi F., Donati S., Gambicorti E., Azzolini C., Costagliola C., Semeraro F.",2018,International Ophthalmology,"Purpose: Proliferative vitreoretinopathy in the inferior retina remains clinically challenging. Heavier-than-water intraocular tamponades have been developed to improve inferior tamponading properties, and their chemical compositions have been substantially improved over the years, in parallel with developments in vitrectomy instrumentation and surgical techniques. Herein we present an updated review of the clinical use of standard formulations and HSO, focusing on analysis of the intraocular inflammation associated with endotamponade agents, and comparison of the adverse effects of these agents on the physical and biological properties of the eye. Methods: A detailed literature search was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar using the key words. Fifty-eight articles matched our inclusion criteria that were included in this systematic review. Results: Perfluorocarbon liquids and partially fluorinated alkanes are associated with tamponade emulsification, intraocular inflammation, and rises in intraocular pressure, but these associations are not as strong when these substances are mixed with a heavy silicone oil (HSO). Two recently approved heavy silicone oil tamponades, Oxane HD and Densiron 68, are now available for use in clinical practice. While the complication spectrum of the new generation of these HSOs seems to be similar to that of conventional silicone oil tamponades, they provide better support for the inferior retina and the posterior pole. Conclusion: Both regular and heavy silicone oils usually yield good success rates in cases of complicated retinal detachment. Decisions as to whether to utilize heavy or regular silicone oil should be made on a case-by-case basis. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Heavy silicone oil; Intraocular inflammation; Standard silicone oil; Vitreous tamponade,alkane; dimeticone; fluorocarbon; silicone oil; silicone oil; capsule opacification; cataract; choroid detachment; cornea edema; cornea opacity; emulsion; endotamponade; eye inflammation; eye synechia; glaucoma; gliosis; human; hypopyon; immunogenicity; intraocular hemorrhage; intraocular hypertension; intraocular hypotension; intraocular pressure; nonhuman; retina detachment; retina hemorrhage; Review; systematic review; uveitis; vitreoretinopathy; chemically induced; chemistry; papilledema; pathophysiology; procedures; retina detachment; vitrectomy; Endotamponade; Humans; Papilledema; Retinal Detachment; Silicone Oils; Vitrectomy,Springer Netherlands
"Determinants of Hair Manganese, lead, cadmium and arsenic levels in environmentally exposed children","Jursa T., Stein C.R., Smith D.R.",2018,Toxics,"Biomarkers of environmental metal exposure in children are important for elucidating exposure and health risk. While exposure biomarkers for As, Cd, and Pb are relatively well defined, there are not yet well-validated biomarkers of Mn exposure. Here, we measured hair Mn, Pb, Cd, and As levels in children from the Mid-Ohio Valley to determine within and between-subject predictors of hair metal levels. Occipital scalp hair was collected in 2009-2010 from 222 children aged 6-12 years (169 female, 53 male) participating in a study of chemical exposure and neurodevelopment in an industrial region of the Mid-Ohio Valley. Hair samples from females were divided into three two centimeter segments, while males provided a single segment. Hair was cleaned and processed in a trace metal clean laboratory, and analyzed for As, Cd, Mn, and Pb by magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Hair Mn and Pb levels were comparable (median 0.11 and 0.15 μg/g, respectively) and were ~10-fold higher than hair Cd and As levels (0.007 and 0.018 μg/g, respectively). Hair metal levels were higher in males compared to females, and varied by ~100-1000-fold between all subjects, and substantially less ( < 40-70%) between segments within female subjects. Hair Mn, Pb, and Cd, but not As levels systematically increased by ~40-70% from the proximal to distal hair segments of females. There was a significant effect of season of hair sample collection on hair Mn, Pb, and Cd, but not As levels. Finally, hair metal levels reported here are ~2 to > 10-fold lower than levels reported in other studies in children, most likely because of more rigorous hair cleaning methodology used in the present study, leading to lower levels of unresolved exogenous metal contamination of hair. © 2018 by the authors.",Arsenic; Cadmium; Children; Environment; Hair; Lead; Manganese,arsenic; cadmium; lead; manganese; perfluoro compound; perfluoroocatnoate; unclassified drug; Article; autumn; child; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental exposure; female; hair level; human; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; male; Ohio; pollution; population exposure; reproducibility; seasonal variation; spring; summer; West Virginia; winter,MDPI AG
Cryptogenic Stroke and Patent Foramen Ovale,"Mojadidi M.K., Zaman M.O., Elgendy I.Y., Mahmoud A.N., Patel N.K., Agarwal N., Tobis J.M., Meier B.",2018,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,"Nearly one-half of patients with cryptogenic stroke have a patent foramen ovale (PFO). The dilemma of whether to close these PFOs percutaneously, in an effort to reduce the risk of recurrent paradoxical embolism, has been a matter of ongoing debate for more than a decade. Early randomized clinical trials failed to demonstrate a significant benefit of percutaneous PFO closure for secondary prevention of cryptogenic stroke in an intention-to-treat analysis. The long-term follow-up data from the RESPECT trial and 2 new randomized trials (CLOSE and REDUCE) have clarified these findings. They showed that with good patient selection, transcatheter PFO closure significantly reduces the risk of recurrent stroke compared with medical therapy in patients with cryptogenic stroke, with no increased risk of serious adverse events or influence on major bleeding. © 2018 American College of Cardiology Foundation",anticoagulants; patent foramen ovale; right-to-left shunt; septal occluder; transesophageal echocardiography; transient ischemic attack,"atrial fibrillation; catheterization; cerebrovascular accident; diagnostic procedure; disease association; European; heart atrium flutter; human; meta analysis (topic); multicenter study (topic); North American; patent foramen ovale; patient safety; patient selection; practice guideline; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrence risk; Review; risk reduction; cerebrovascular accident; diagnostic imaging; patent foramen ovale; procedures; risk factor; Foramen Ovale, Patent; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Factors; Stroke",Elsevier USA
Device closure versus medical therapy alone for patent foramen ovale in patients with cryptogenic stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Shah R., Nayyar M., Jovin I.S., Rashid A., Bondy B.R., Fan T.H.M., Flaherty M.P., Rao S.V.",2018,Annals of Internal Medicine,"Background: The optimal strategy for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO) is unknown. Purpose: To compare transcatheter PFO closure with medical therapy alone for prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke. Data Sources: PubMed and the Cochrane Library (without language restrictions) from inception to October 2017, reference lists, and abstracts from cardiology meetings. Study Selection: Randomized trials enrolling adults with PFO and cryptogenic stroke that compared stroke outcomes (main outcome) and potential harms in those receiving transcatheter device closure versus medical therapy alone. Data Extraction: Two investigators independently extracted study data and rated risk of bias. Data Synthesis: Of 5 trials, 1 was excluded because it used a device that is no longer available due to high rates of complications and failure. Four high-quality trials enrolling 2892 patients showed that PFO closure decreased the absolute risk for recurrent stroke by 3.2% (risk difference, -0.032 [95% CI, -0.050 to -0.014]) compared with medical therapy. The treatment strategies did not differ in rates of transient ischemic attack or major bleeding. Closure of PFOs was associated with higher rates of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) than medical therapy alone in all trials, but this outcome had marked between-trial heterogeneity (I2 = 82.5%), and high event rates in some groups resulted in extreme values for CIs. Limitation: Heterogeneity of device type and antithrombotic therapy across trials, small numbers for some outcomes, and heterogeneous and inconclusive AF results. Conclusion: In patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke, transcatheter device closure decreases risk for recurrent stroke compared with medical therapy alone. Because recurrent stroke rates are low even with medical therapy alone and PFO closure might affect AF risk, shared decision making is crucial for this treatment. © 2018 American College of Physicians.",,"acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; clopidogrel; ticlopidine; warfarin; anticoagulant therapy; cerebrovascular accident; Cochrane Library; human; Medline; meta analysis; multicenter study (topic); new-onset atrial fibrillation; outcome assessment; patent foramen ovale; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent disease; Review; stroke patient; surgical technique; systematic review; transcatheter device closure; transient ischemic attack; cerebrovascular accident; complication; patent foramen ovale; procedures; recurrent disease; risk assessment; secondary prevention; septal occluder; Foramen Ovale, Patent; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recurrence; Risk Assessment; Secondary Prevention; Septal Occluder Device; Stroke",American College of Physicians
Comparison of a twin interlocking derotation and compression screw cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) with a single screw derotation cephalomedullary nail (proximal femoral nail antirotation): A systematic review and meta-analysis for intertrochanteric fractures,"Nherera L., Trueman P., Horner A., Watson T., Johnstone A.J.",2018,Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research,"Background: Intertrochanteric hip fractures are common and devastating injuries especially for the elderly. Surgical treatment is the optimal strategy for managing intertrochanteric fractures as it allows early rehabilitation and functional recovery. The relative effects of internal fixation strategies for intertrochanteric fracture after operation remain limited to relatively small studies which create uncertainty in attempts to establish evidence-based best practice. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies to assess the clinical effectiveness of two commonly used intramedullary devices: a twin screw integrated cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) versus a single screw cephalomedullary nail (proximal femoral nail antirotation) in patients with intertrochanteric fractures. The following outcomes were considered: revisions, implant-related failures, non-unions, pain, Harris Hip Score and intraoperative outcomes. Odds ratios or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals in brackets are reported. Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria, two randomised controlled trials and four observational studies enrolling 970 patients with mean age of 77years, and 64% of patients were female. There was a statistically significant difference (p value <0.05) for revisions OR 0.27 (0.13 to 0.56), implant-related failures OR 0.16 (0.09 to 0.27) and proportion of patients complaining of pain OR 0.50 (0.34 to 0.74). There was no difference in non-unions and Harris Hip Score (p value >0.05). There was a significant difference in blood loss and fluoroscopy usage in favour of PFNA, whilst no difference in operating times were observed between the two devices. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that a twin screw integrated cephalomedullary nail InterTAN is clinically more effective when compared to a single screw cephalomedullary nail proximal femoral nail antirotation resulting in fewer complications, fewer revisions and fewer patients complaining of pain. No difference has been established regarding non-unions and Harris Hip Score. Intraoperative outcomes favour PFNA with less blood loss and fluoroscopy usage. Further studies are warranted to explore the cost-effectiveness of these and other implants in managing patients with intertrochanteric fractures. © 2018 The Author(s).",Cephalomedullary nail; Intertrochanteric hip fractures; Intramedullary nails; Meta-analysis; Systematic review,"adverse device effect; bone nail; bone screw; comparative study; devices; hip fracture; human; intramedullary nailing; meta analysis; procedures; prosthesis complication; prosthesis design; Bone Nails; Bone Screws; Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary; Hip Fractures; Humans; Prosthesis Design; Prosthesis Failure",BioMed Central Ltd.
A Systematic Review of Frailty Assessments in Women with Pelvic Floor Disorders: Are We Following the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program/American Geriatric Society Guidelines?,"Zeno A., Alvarez P., Yazdany T.",2018,Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery,"Introduction Associations between frailty and women with pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) are not well understood. This study seeks to describe studies among women with PFD and the associated frailty assessments as recommended in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program/American Geriatric Society (ACS NSQIP/AGS) guidelines. Methods This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) criteria are applied to assess study quality. Data synthesis is descriptive. Outcomes of interest include the ratio of studies adhering to the ACS NSQIP/AGS guidelines and evidence for frailty assessments versus usual care for women with PFDs. Results Twenty studies regarding frailty and PFDs were included for systematic review. Studies were categorized as relating to (1) epidemiology, (2) frailty and incontinence, (3) postoperative morbidity, and (4) surgical choice. Most studies (5/20) did not define frailty or failed to follow the ACS NSQIP/AGS guidelines. All studies were of very low to low quality. Collectively, each category generated very low GRADE quality evidence of frailty and the relationship to PFDs. Conclusions Most studies regarding frailty among women with PFDs did not define frailty as recommended in the ACS NSQIP/AGS guidelines. The evidence regarding PFDs and frailty is of very low quality. This is the first systematic review regarding frailty assessments specifically among women with PFDs. Paucity of data regarding frailty in women with PFDs, particularly with regard to surgical choice and surgical counseling, highlights the need for further study in this area. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Perfluorooctanoic acid and low birth weight: Estimates of US attributable burden and economic costs from 2003 through 2014,"Malits J., Blustein J., Trasande L., Attina T.M.",2018,International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health,"Background and objective: In utero exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been associated with decreases in birth weight. We aimed to estimate the proportion of PFOA-attributable low birth weight (LBW) births and associated costs in the US from 2003 to 2014, a period during which there were industry-initiated and regulatory activities aimed at reducing exposure. Methods: Serum PFOA levels among women 18–49 years were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2003–2014; birth weight distributions were obtained from the Vital Statistics Natality Birth Data. The exposure-response relationship identified in a previous meta-analysis (18.9 g decrease in birth weight per 1 ng/mL of PFOA) was applied to quantify PFOA-attributable LBW (reference level of 3.1 ng/mL for our base case, 1 and 3.9 ng/mL for sensitivity analyses). Hospitalization costs and lost economic productivity were also estimated. Results: Serum PFOA levels remained approximately constant from 2003–2004 (median: 3.3 ng/mL) to 2007–2008 (3.5 ng/mL), and declined from 2009–2010 (2.8 ng/mL) to 2013–2014 (1.6 ng/mL). In 2003–2004, an estimated 12,764 LBW cases (4% of total for those years) were potentially preventable if PFOA exposure were reduced to the base case reference level (10,203 cases in 2009–2010 and 1,491 in 2013–2014). The total cost of PFOA-attributable LBW for 2003 through 2014 was estimated at $13.7 billion, with $2.97 billion in 2003–2004, $2.4 billion in 2009–2010 and $347 million in 2013–2014. Conclusions: Serum PFOA levels began to decline in women of childbearing age in 2009–2010. Declines were of a magnitude expected to meaningfully reduce the estimated incidence of PFOA-attributable LBW and associated costs. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH",Economic costs; Low birth weight; NHANES; PFOA exposure,"fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; blood; cost; economics; female; human; low birth weight; maternal exposure; pregnancy; theoretical model; United States; Caprylates; Costs and Cost Analysis; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Maternal Exposure; Models, Theoretical; Pregnancy; United States",Elsevier GmbH
Metabolomics Uncovers the Regulatory Pathway of Acyl-homoserine Lactones Based Quorum Sensing in Anammox Consortia,"Tang X., Guo Y., Wu S., Chen L., Tao H., Liu S.",2018,Environmental Science and Technology,"Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs)-mediated quorum sensing in bacterial communities have been extensively observed. However, the metabolic pathways regulated by AHLs in bacteria remain elusive. Here, we combined long-term reactor operation with microbiological and metabolomics analyses to explore the regulatory pathways for different AHLs in anammox consortia, which perform promising nitrogen removal for wastewater treatment. The results showed that no obvious shifts induced by exogenous AHLs occurred in the microbial community and, mainly, dosing AHLs induced changes in the metabolites. 3OC6-HSL, C6-HSL, and C8-HSL controlled the electron transport carriers that influence the bacterial activity. In contrast, only 3OC6-HSL regulated LysoPC(20:0) metabolism, which affected bacterial growth. AHLs mainly regulated the synthesis of the amino acids Ala, Val, and Glu and selectively regulated Asp and Leu to affect extracellular proteins. Simultaneously, all the AHLs regulated the ManNAc biosynthetic pathways, while OC6-HSL, OC8-HSL, and C6-HSL particularly enriched the UDP-GlcNAc pathway to promote exopolysaccharides, resulting in different aggregation levels of the anammox consortia. Our results not only provide the first metabolic insights into the means by which AHLs affect anammox consortia but also hint at potential strategies for overcoming the limitations of the long start-up period required for wastewater treatment by anammox processing. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,Bacteria; Biosynthesis; Electron transport properties; Esters; Metabolism; Metabolites; Nitrogen removal; Acyl homoserine lactones; Bacterial activity; Bacterial community; Biosynthetic pathway; Exopolysaccharides; Extracellular proteins; Metabolic pathways; Microbial communities; Wastewater treatment; 2 acetylamino 2 deoxy mannopyranose; alanine; aspartic acid; bacterial protein; cell protein; exopolysaccharide; glutamic acid; glycerophospholipid; leucine; n acylhomoserine lactone; nitrogen; succinic semialdehyde; uridine diphosphate n acetylgalactosamine; valine; gamma butyrolactone; gamma butyrolactone derivative; lactone; bacterium; bioreactor; metabolism; microbial activity; microbial community; operations technology; organic compound; pollutant removal; wastewater treatment; amino acid synthesis; anammox bacterium; Article; bacterial growth; bacterial metabolism; biomass production; carbohydrate synthesis; controlled study; electron transport; heavy metal removal; metabolomics; microbial activity; microbial biomass; microbial community; microbial consortium; nonhuman; quorum sensing; reactor operation; regulatory mechanism; waste water management; chemoautotrophy; metabolomics; waste water; Bacteria (microorganisms); 4-Butyrolactone; Acyl-Butyrolactones; Chemoautotrophic Growth; Lactones; Metabolomics; Quorum Sensing; Waste Water,American Chemical Society
Evaluation of digestion methods for analysis of trace metals in mammalian tissues and NIST 1577c,"Binder G.A., Metcalf R., Atlas Z., Daniel K.G.",2018,Analytical Biochemistry,"Digestion techniques for ICP analysis have been poorly studied for biological samples. This report describes an optimized method for analysis of trace metals that can be used across a variety of sample types. Digestion methods were tested and optimized with the analysis of trace metals in cancerous as compared to normal tissue as the end goal. Anthropological, forensic, oncological and environmental research groups can employ this method reasonably cheaply and safely whilst still being able to compare between laboratories. We examined combined HNO3 and H2O2 digestion at 170 °C for human, porcine and bovine samples whether they are frozen, fresh or lyophilized powder. Little discrepancy is found between microwave digestion and PFA Teflon pressure vessels. The elements of interest (Cu, Zn, Fe and Ni) yielded consistently higher and more accurate values on standard reference material than samples heated to 75 °C or samples that utilized HNO3 alone. Use of H2SO4 does not improve homogeneity of the sample and lowers precision during ICP analysis. High temperature digestions (&gt;165 °C) using a combination of HNO3 and H2O2 as outlined are proposed as a standard technique for all mammalian tissues, specifically, human tissues and yield greater than 300% higher values than samples digested at 75 °C regardless of the acid or acid combinations used. The proposed standardized technique is designed to accurately quantify potential discrepancies in metal loads between cancerous and healthy tissues and applies to numerous tissue studies requiring quick, effective and safe digestions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Digestion method; ICP-MS; ICP-OES; NIST 1577c; Pancreatic cancer; Trace metals,copper; hydrogen peroxide; iron; nickel; nitric acid; politef; sulfuric acid; zinc ion; trace element; animal tissue; Article; chemical analysis; chemical procedures; concentration (parameters); controlled study; heating; high temperature; human; human tissue; kidney tissue; liver; lung; mass spectrometry; microwave radiation; nonhuman; pancreas cancer; pancreas tissue; priority journal; process optimization; tissue digestion; tissues; animal; chemistry; kidney; metabolism; pancreas; pig; standard; Animals; Kidney; Liver; Lung; Mass Spectrometry; Pancreas; Reference Standards; Swine; Trace Elements,Academic Press Inc.
Efficacy of fast track surgery in laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer:a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Liu Q., Ding L., Jiang H., Zhang C., Jin J.",2018,International Journal of Surgery,"Objective To conduct a systematic review of efficacy and security of fast track surgery (FTS) in laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library Databases and supplemented by other searches to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the comparison of fast track surgery combined with laparoscopy versus laparoscopy separately used in radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer before December 2016. After screening for inclusion, data extraction, and quality assessment, meta-analysis was conducted by the Review Manager 5.3 software. Results A total of 6 RCTs, involving 464 patients, were included. There were 232 patients in the FTS group and conventional care group separately. Compared with the conventional care group, patients of FTS group had shorter postoperative hospital stay [WMD = −1.85, 95%CI: (−2.60, −1.11), P <.00001], earlier first flatus [WMD = −9.33, 95%CI: (−13.74, −4.91), P <.0001], lower level of C-reactive protein (CRP) at postoperative day 4 [WMD = −13.94, 95%CI: (−22.74, −5.15), P =.002], and less hospitalization fees [SMD = −1.12, 95%CI: (−2.07, −0.18), P =.02]. There were no significant differences in operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative complications between the two groups. Conclusion Based on current evidence, the FTS protocol is safe and effective in laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Due to the limitations of our study, further larger and multicenter studies are needed to validate our findings. © 2017 IJS Publishing Group Ltd",Fast track surgery; Laparoscopy; Meta-analysis; Radical resection of gastric cancer,C reactive protein; C reactive protein; fast track surgery; flatulence; gastrectomy; hospital charge; hospital cost; hospital readmission; hospitalization; human; laparoscopic surgery; laparoscopy; meta analysis; operation duration; operative blood loss; postoperative complication; postoperative period; priority journal; radical resection; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; stomach cancer; surgical technique; systematic review; economics; female; gastrectomy; length of stay; male; postoperative complication; procedures; statistics and numerical data; stomach tumor; treatment outcome; C-Reactive Protein; Female; Gastrectomy; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Male; Operative Time; Postoperative Complications; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stomach Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome,Elsevier Ltd
Mode of action characterization for adverse effect of propranolol in Daphnia magna based on behavior and physiology monitoring and metabolite profiling,"Jeong T.-Y., Yoon D., Kim S., Kim H.Y., Kim S.D.",2018,Environmental Pollution,"Studies are underway to gather information about the mode of action (MOA) of emerging pollutants that could guide practical environmental decision making. Previously, we showed that propranolol, an active pharmaceutical ingredient, had adverse effects on Daphnia magna that were similar to its pharmaceutical action. In order to characterize the mode of action of propranolol in D. magna, which is suspected to be organ-specific pharmaceutical action or baseline toxicity, we performed time-series monitoring of behavior along with heart rate measurements and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabolite profiling. Principle component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering were used to categorize the mode of action of propranolol among 5 chemicals with different modes of action. The findings showed that the mode of action of propranolol in D. magna is organ-specific and vastly different from those of narcotics, even though metabolite regulation is similar between narcotic and non-narcotic candidates. The method applied in this study seems applicable to rapid characterization of the MOA of other cardiovascular pharmaceutical ingredients. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Daphnia magna; Metabolites; Mode of action; Propranolol,"Biomolecules; Birds; Decision making; Drug products; Metabolites; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Active pharmaceutical ingredients; Daphnia magna; Environmental decision making; Mode of action; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR); Pharmaceutical ingredients; Principle component analysis; Propranolol; Principal component analysis; propranolol; propranolol; cluster analysis; crustacean; decision making; drug; metabolite; monitoring; physiology; plankton; principal component analysis; animal experiment; Article; cluster analysis; controlled study; Daphnia magna; heart rate measurement; locomotion; metabolic regulation; metabolomics; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; principal component analysis; time series analysis; animal; Daphnia; drug effects; toxicity; toxicity testing; water pollutant; Daphnia magna; Animals; Daphnia; Propranolol; Toxicity Tests; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier Ltd
Stabilization of Perfluorinated Membranes Using Ce 3+ and Mn 2+ Redox Scavengers: Mechanisms and Applications,"Coms F.D., Schlick S., Danilczuk M.",2018,The Chemistry of Membranes Used in Fuel Cells: Degradation and Stabilization,"This chapter addresses the details of perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) chemical degradation and mitigation strategies from a chemically rigorous mechanistic perspective, providing insights into this long-standing obstacle to the cost-effective widespread implementation of this technology. There are two principal strategies that can be employed to decrease the rates and impact of chemical degradation. The first involves decreasing the concentration of reactive oxidant species formed in the fuel cell. The second strategy for chemical degradation mitigation involves deactivation of the oxidants before membrane damage occurs. In 2005, it was reported that Ce3+ and Mn2+ are very effective at protecting PFSA membranes from chemical degradation. The use of Mn2+ will be discussed by analogy. The metal cations can be introduced to the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) by a number of methods, including direct membrane doping or transfer from the electrode ink or ionomer overcoat. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",Ce3+ redox scavengers; Chemical degradation; Fuel cell; Membrane electrode assembly design; Metal cations; Mn2+ redox scavengers; Oxidant chemistry; Perfluorosulfonic acid membrane,Cost effectiveness; Electrodes; Fuel cells; Membranes; Oxidants; Positive ions; Ce3+ redox scavengers; Chemical degradation; Membrane electrode assemblies; Metal cation; Mn2+ redox scavengers; Perfluorosulfonic acid membranes; Degradation,wiley
What is the effect of phasing out long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances on the concentrations of perfluoroalkyl acids and their precursors in the environment? A systematic review,"Land M., De Wit C.A., Bignert A., Cousins I.T., Herzke D., Johansson J.H., Martin J.W.",2018,Environmental Evidence,"Background: There is a concern that continued emissions of man-made per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may cause environmental and human health effects. Now widespread in human populations and in the environment, several PFASs are also present in remote regions of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of PFASs are not well understood. Phasing out the manufacture of some types of PFASs started in 2000 and further regulatory and voluntary actions have followed. The objective of this review is to understand the effects of these actions on global scale PFAS concentrations. Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations were performed in bibliographic databases, on the internet, through stakeholder contacts and in review bibliographies. No time, document type, language or geographical constraints were applied in the searches. Relevant subjects included human and environmental samples. Two authors screened all retrieved articles. Dual screening of 10% of the articles was performed at title/abstract and full-text levels by all authors. Kappa tests were used to test consistency. Relevant articles were critically appraised by four reviewers, with double checking of 20% of the articles by a second reviewer. Meta-analysis of included temporal trends was considered but judged to not be appropriate. The trends were therefore discussed in a narrative synthesis. Results: Available evidence suggests that human concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) generally are declining, while previously increasing concentrations of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) have begun to level off. Rapid declines for PFOS-precursors (e.g. perfluorooctane sulfonamide, FOSA) have also been consistently observed in human studies. In contrast, limited data indicate that human concentrations of PFOS and PFOA are increasing in China where the production of these substances has increased. Human concentrations of longer-chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) with 9-14 carbon atoms are generally increasing or show insignificant trends with too low power to detect a trend. For abiotic and biological environmental samples there are no clear patterns of declining trends. Most substances show mixed results, and a majority of the trends are insignificant with low power to detect a trend. Conclusions: For electrochemically derived PFASs, including PFOS and PFOA, most human studies in North America and Europe show consistent statistically significant declines. This contrasts with findings in wildlife and in abiotic environmental samples, suggesting that declining PFOS, PFOS-precursor and PFOA concentrations in humans likely resulted from removal of certain PFASs from commercial products including paper and board used in food packaging. Increasing concentrations of long-chain PFCAs in most matrices, and in most regions, is likely due to increased use of alternative PFASs. Continued temporal trend monitoring in the environment with well-designed studies with high statistical power are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of past and continuing regulatory mitigation measures. For humans, more temporal trend studies are needed in regions where manufacturing is most intense, as the one human study available in China is much different than in North America or Europe. © 2018 The Author(s).",Concentration; Emission; Environmental fate; Perfluoroalkane acids; PFOA; PFOS; Phase-out; Regulation; Source; Temporal trends,,BioMed Central Ltd.
Quantitative profiling of carbonyl metabolites directly in crude biological extracts using chemoselective tagging and nanoESI-FTMS,"Deng P., Higashi R.M., Lane A.N., Bruntz R.C., Sun R.C., Ramakrishnam Raju M.V., Nantz M.H., Qi Z., Fan T.W.-M.",2018,Analyst,"The extensive range of chemical structures, wide range of abundances, and chemical instability of metabolites present in the metabolome pose major analytical challenges that are difficult to address with existing technologies. To address these issues, one approach is to target a subset of metabolites that share a functional group, such as ketones and aldehydes, using chemoselective tagging. Here we report a greatly improved chemoselective method for the quantitative analysis of hydrophilic and hydrophobic carbonyl-containing metabolites directly in biological samples. This method is based on direct tissue or cells extraction with simultaneous derivatization of stable and labile carbonylated metabolites using N-[2-(aminooxy)ethyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1-dodecylammonium (QDA) and 13CD3 labeled QDA. We combined innovations of direct quenching of biological sample with frozen derivatization conditions under the catalyst N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, which facilitated the formation of oxime stable-isotope ion pairs differing by m/z 4.02188 while minimizing metabolite degradation. The resulting oximes were extracted by HyperSep C8 tips to remove interfering compounds, and the products were detected using nano-electrospray ionization interfaced with a Thermo Fusion mass spectrometer. The quaternary ammonium tagging greatly increased electrospray MS detection sensitivity and the signature ions pairs enabled simple identification of carbonyl compounds. The improved method showed the lower limits of quantification for carbonyl standards to be in the range of 0.20-2 nM, with linearity of R2 &gt; 0.99 over 4 orders of magnitude. We have applied the method to assign 66 carbonyls in mouse tumor tissues, many of which could not be assigned solely by accurate mass and tandem MS. Fourteen of the metabolites were quantified using authentic standards. We also demonstrated the suitability of this method for determining 13C labeled isotopologues of carbonyl metabolites in 13C6-glucose-based stable isotope-resolved metabolomic (SIRM) studies. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Royal Society of Chemistry
Reliability of cryptographic information on fiscal data,"Volkov D.V., Maloletko A.N.",2018,European Research Studies Journal,"The relevance of the study is due to the fact that modern data exchange systems transport information that stores elements of personal information. The operator of fiscal data is interested in secure transport of information. The degree of security in modern realities is very important and is designed to ensure confidentiality on the one hand, and on the other hand, full transparency of information for state monitoring bodies. In this regard, this article aims to identify the weaknesses of the adopted system of transport of cryptographic information by the operator of fiscal data and to systematize the theoretical data in relation to the theory on the question of part of the FTS data. The leading approach to the study of the problem is the analysis of the existing system in conjunction with the synthesis of data through the compilation of information, which allows a comprehensive review and systematization of data on the economic phenomenon. The article substantiates the need to reduce the state regulation of restrictions on the formation of information security barriers.

Management of patent foramen ovale in patients with cryptogenic stroke: Is device closure superior to medical treatment? A brief review,"Sidia B., Saleh C., El Issa M., Mono M.-L.",2018,Surgical Neurology International,"Background: Recent randomized controlled trial (RCTs) comparing percutaneous closure with antithrombotic treatment in patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) and cryptogenic stroke revealed inconsistent results. Indeed, there is still no consensus on the management of these patients, namely closure or medical therapy treatment. Methods: To take stock of the PFO management after cryptogenic stroke, we conducted a literature review that included 16 articles dealing with different therapeutic strategies and long-term outcomes of these results. Results: The reviewed studies showed great methodological diversity rendering an exhaustive and balanced comparison between studies difficult. Low recurrence rates under prevention regimens, crossovers, procedure- and device-related complications, as well as inappropriate patient selection might explain the inconsistency of trials. However, despite the methodological heterogeneity certain patterns could be detected. It appears that device closure as secondary prevention measure is an effective and safe procedure reducing the recurrence of neurological events in cryptogenic stroke patients <60 years with large PFOs. Standardization of procedures and larger trials are needed to arrive to definitive conclusions. Conclusion: In cryptogenic stroke patients <60 years with large PFOs, PFO closure seems to be safe and more effective compared to medical treatment alone. For all other patients group, for example, patients >60 years further trials are needed to clarify the role of PFO closure. © 2018 Surgical Neurology International Published by Wolters Kluwer Medknow.",Closure device; cryptogenic stroke; management; patent foramen ovale,anticoagulant agent; anticoagulant therapy; atrial fibrillation; bacterial endocarditis; brain ischemia; cardiovascular mortality; cerebrovascular accident; chest tightness; deep vein thrombosis; heart atrium flutter; heart perforation; human; lung embolism; Medline; meta analysis; neurology; patent foramen ovale; patient selection; pericardial effusion; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrence risk; recurrent disease; Review; secondary prevention; standardization; transient ischemic attack,Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications
Questionnaires to evaluate pelvic floor dysfunction in the postpartum period: A systematic review,"Zuchelo L.T.S., Bezerra I.M.P., Da Silva A.T.M., Gomes J.M., Soares Júnior J.M., Chada Baracat E., de Abreu L.C., Sorpreso I.C.E.",2018,International Journal of Women's Health,"Background: Pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFDs) affect the female population, and the postpartum period can be related to the onset or aggravation of the disease. Early identification of the symptoms and the impact on quality of life can be achieved through assessment instruments. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate questionnaires used to assess PFD in the postpartum period. Methods: A systematic review study was conducted, following Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria, using the databases: PubMed, Biblioteca Virtual de Saúde (BVS), Web of Science, and Scopus, and the keywords PFD or pelvic floor disorders, postpartum or puerperium, and questionnaire. Articles published up till May 2018 were included, searching for articles using validated questionnaires for the evaluation of PFDs in postpartum women. The articles included were evaluated according to a checklist, and the validation studies and translated versions of the questionnaires were identified. Results: The search of the databases resulted in 359 papers, and 33 were selected to compose this systematic review, using nine validated questionnaires to assess PFDs in the postpartum period: International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire – Vaginal Symptoms (ICIQ-VS), Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory 20 (PFDI-20), Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ-7), PFDI-46, Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ-31), Pelvic Floor Bother Questionnaire (PFBQ), Female Pelvic Floor Questionnaire, electronic Personal Assessment Questionnaire – Pelvic Floor, and PFD questionnaire specific for pregnancy and postpartum. The most frequently reported questionnaires included PFDI-20, PFIQ-7, and ICIQ-VS and are recommended by ICI. In addition, the review identified a specific questionnaire, recently developed, to access PFD during pregnancy and postpartum. Conclusion: The questionnaires used to evaluate PFD during postpartum period are developed for general population or urology/gynecology patients with incontinence and reinforce the paucity of highly recommended questionnaires designed for postpartum, in order to improve early and specific approach for this period of life. © 2018 Zuchelo et al.",Patient reported outcome measure; Pelvic floor disorders; Primary health care; Puerperium; Surveys and questionnaires; Women’s health,checklist; clinical evaluation; electronic Personal Assessment Questionnaire Pelvic Floor; Female Pelvic Floor Questionnaire; human; International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Vaginal Symptoms; patient-reported outcome; Pelvic Floor Bother Questionnaire; pelvic floor disorder; Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory 20; Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory 46; Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire 31; Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire 7; pregnancy; primary health care; puerperium; questionnaire; Review; systematic review; urogenital tract disease assessment; validation study,Dove Medical Press Ltd
Serum perfluorooctanoic acid and birthweight an updated meta-analysis with bias analysis,"Steenland K., Barry V., Savitz D.",2018,Epidemiology,"Background: A recent meta-analysis of 15 studies found a change in birthweight of −12.8 g (95% CI = −23.1, −2.38) per ng/ml PFOA in maternal or cord blood and −27.1 g (−50.6, −3.6) per log ng/ml PFOA. Almost all studies were done in low-exposed populations. There are nine new studies, adding 6,019 births to the previous 6,937 births. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of 24 studies. To combine all results, we approximated results for untransformed PFOA from nine studies using log-transformed PFOA. We also included another large study, excluded from previous analyses, in a sensitivity analysis. Results: We found a change of birthweight of −10.5 g (−16.7, −4.4) for every ng/ml PFOA in maternal or cord blood. After adding one previously excluded large study, we found little evidence of an association (−1.0 g; 95% CI = −2.4, 0.4). Restricting to studies where blood was sampled from mothers early in the pregnancy or shortly before conception (5,393 births), we found little association of PFOA with birthweight (−3.3 g [−9.6, 3.0]). In studies where blood was sampled late in the pregnancy (7563 pregnancies), lower birthweight was associated with higher PFOA (−17.8 [−25.0, −10.6]). Conclusion: Present human evidence provides only modest support for decreased birthweight with increasing PFOA. Studies with a wide range of exposure, and studies with blood sampled early in pregnancy, showed little or no association of PFOA with birthweight. These are studies in which confounding and reverse causality would be of less concern. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Birthweight; Meta-analysis; PFOA,perfluorooctanoic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; Article; birth weight; blood analysis; blood sampling; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; childbirth; comparative study; conception; evidence based practice; human; maternal blood; meta analysis; pregnancy; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; umbilical cord blood; blood; chemistry; drug effect; female; fetus blood; Birth Weight; Caprylates; Female; Fetal Blood; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Pregnancy,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins
Lipid metabolism alteration by endocrine disruptors in animal models: An overview,"Maradonna F., Carnevali O.",2018,Frontiers in Endocrinology,"Exposure to potential Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) pose a documented risk to both wildlife and human health. Many studies so far described declining sperm counts, genital malformations, early puberty onset, highlighting the negative impact on reproduction caused by the exposure to many anthropogenic chemicals. In the last years, increasing evidence suggested that these compounds, other than altering reproduction, affect metabolism and induce the onset of obesity and metabolic disorders. According to the “environmental obesogens” hypothesis, evidence exists that exposure to potential EDCs during critical periods when adipocytes are differentiating, and organs are developing, can induce diseases that manifest later in the life. This review summarizes the effects occurring at the hepatic level in different animal models, describing morphological alterations and changes of molecular pathways elicited by the toxicant exposure. Results currently available demonstrated that these chemicals impair normal metabolic processes via interaction with members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, including steroid hormone receptors, thyroid hormone receptors, retinoid X receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, liver X receptors, and farnesoid X receptors. In addition, novel results revealed that EDC exposure can either affect circadian rhythms as well as up-regulate the expression of signals belonging to the endocannabinoid system, in both cases leading to a remarkable increase of lipid accumulation. These results warrant further research and increase the interest toward the identification of new mechanisms for EDC metabolic alterations. The last part of this review article condenses recent evidences on the ability of potential EDCs to cause “transgenerational effects” by a single prenatal or early life exposure. On this regard, there is compelling evidence that epigenetic modifications link developmental environmental insults to adult disease susceptibility. This review will contribute to summarize the mechanisms underlying the insurgence of EDC-induced metabolic alterations as well as to build integrated strategies for their better management. In fact, despite the large number of results obtained so far, there is still a great demand for the development of frameworks that can integrate mechanistic and toxicological/epidemiological observations. This would increase legal and governmental institution awareness on this critical environmental issue responsible for negative consequences in both wild species and human health.

Environmental Chemical Exposure and Its Effects on Infants' Reproductive Hormones,"Araki A., Itoh S., Miyashita C., Minatoya M., Kishi R.",2018,Nihon eiseigaku zasshi. Japanese journal of hygiene,"In recent years, the birthrate has been continuously declining in Japan. The main causes of the decline are social factors. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that many environmental chemicals show endocrine disrupting properties. Thus, we hypothesized that exposure to these chemicals would also be a causal for the fertility crisis. In this review, we examined current evidence that focused on environmental chemical exposure in utero and its association with reproductive hormones in children. We have included the findings from a prospective birth cohorts, the Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health Sapporo cohort. According to the literature, environmental chemical levels in utero, such as polychlorinated biphenyl, dioxins, perfluorinated chemical substances, phthalates, and bisphenol A were somewhat associated with the levels of reproductive hormones, such as testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, inhibin B, and insulin-like factor-3 in cord blood, in early childhood and adolescence. The literature also suggests the association between exposure to these chemicals and brain-sexual differentiation or the anogenital distance, which suggests the disruption of androgen shower during the developmental stage in the fetal period. There are still knowledge gaps on whether these hormones at an early stage affect the pubertal development and reproductive functions in later life. In addition, alternative chemicals are produced after banning one type. The health effects of alternative chemicals should be evaluated. Effects of exposure to a mixture of the chemicals should also be examined in future studies. In conclusion, the prevention of environmental chemical hazards in relation to human reproductive function is important. It would be one of the countermeasures to the falling birthrate caused by fertility issues.",declining birthrate; endocrine disruptors; environmental chemicals; in utero; reproductive hormones,endocrine disruptor; sex hormone; birth rate; child; environmental exposure; female; fetomaternal transfusion; fetus development; human; infertility; male; maternal exposure; metabolism; population dynamics; pregnancy; statistics and numerical data; trends; Birth Rate; Child; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Female; Fetal Development; Gonadal Hormones; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Humans; Infertility; Male; Maternal Exposure; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Population Dynamics; Pregnancy,
Prenatal exposure to endocrine disruptors and cardiometabolic risk in preschoolers: A systematic review based on cohort studies,"Gutiérrez-Torres D.S., Barraza-Villarreal A., Hernandez-Cadena L., Escamilla-Nuñez C., Romieu I.",2018,Annals of Global Health,"Background: Follow-up studies have reported both positive and negative associations between prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and some anthropometric indicators of overweight and obesity in children. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of this exposure on cardiometabolic risk factors in preschool-age children. The health and disease development paradigm (DOHaD) proposes that the physiological and metabolic adaptations triggered by the exposure to these compounds, coupled with postnatal conditions, can modify the risk of disease. In this context, cardiometabolic risk factors in children are not only an important outcome derived from prenatal exposure but a predictor/mediator of the children’s future health. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the evidence published in the last 10 years from cohort studies on the association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and cardiometabolic risk factors in preschoolers. Design: Studies published from January 1, 2007 to May 1, 2017 in PubMed were analyzed. The research strategy was based on specified keywords and following the application of strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, 16 studies were identified and reviewed. Data were extracted and aspects of quality were assessed using an adapted Newcastle–Ottawa scale for cohort studies. Results: Only 5 of the 16 studies reviewed analyzed cardiometabolic risk factors in addition to anthropometric measures in children. The cohort studies included in this review suggest that prenatal exposure to low concentrations of EDCs has an impact on anthropometric variables and biochemical parameters in preschool-age children. Positive associations between prenatal exposure to EDCs and percentage of fat mass, body mass index, waist circumference, skinfolds and risk of overweight persisted after adjustment for important confounding variables. No association was found with lipid profile and glucose levels. Conclusions: Evidence was found to suggest that prenatal exposure to EDCs is positively associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in preschool children. © 2018 The Author(s).",,"1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 2,5 dichlorophenol; adiponectin; arsenic; C reactive protein; cadmium; cholesterol; endocrine disruptor; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lead; leptin; mercury; oxybenzone; perfluorooctane; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; phthalic acid derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; triclosan; endocrine disruptor; abdominal circumference; anthropometric parameters; body height; body mass; body weight; cardiometabolic risk; child; childhood obesity; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; diastolic blood pressure; fat mass; female; glucose level; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; human; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; prenatal exposure; preschool child; Review; skinfold thickness; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; waist circumference; waist to height ratio; cardiovascular disease; child health; metabolic disorder; pregnancy; prevention and control; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child Health; Child, Preschool; Endocrine Disruptors; Female; Humans; Metabolic Diseases; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects",Levy Library Press
"In vivo oxygen, temperature and pH dynamics in the female reproductive tract and their importance in human conception: A systematic review","Ng K.Y.B., Mingels R., Morgan H., Macklon N., Cheong Y.",2018,Human Reproduction Update,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in ART, implantation and pregnancy rates per embryo transfer still remain low. IVF laboratories strive to ensure that the process of handling gametes in vitro closely mimics the in vivo environment. However, there remains a lack of knowledge regarding the in vivo regulation and dynamic variation in biophysical parameters such as oxygen concentration, pH and temperature within the reproductive tract. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: To undertake a systematic review of the current understanding of the physico-chemical parameters of oxygen tension (pO2), pH and temperature within the female reproductive tract, and their potential implications in clinical and pathological processes related to fertility and those pertaining to limited reproductive capacity. SEARCH METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Pubmed to identify original and review articles addressing the biophysical parameters (pO2, pH and temperature) in the female reproductive tract of any species. The search included all studies published between 1946 and November 2015. Search terms included 'oxygen', 'pH', 'hydrogen ion concentration', 'acid base' and others terms. We also used special features and truncations to identify synonyms and broaden the search. Studies were excluded if they only assessed embryo culture conditions, fetal acid-base status, oxidative stress, outcomes of pregnancy and measurements of these parameters in non-reproductive organs. OUTCOMES: Our search generated 18 685 records and 60 articles were included. pO2 within the female reproductive tract shows cyclical variation and minute-to-minute oscillations, which may be influenced by uterine contractility, hormones, the autonomic system, cardiac pulsatility, and myometrial and smooth muscle integrity. Fine balanced control of pO2 and avoidance of overwhelming oxidative stress is crucial for embryogenesis and implantation. The pH in the female reproductive tract is graduated, with lowest pH in the vagina (~pH 4.42) increasing toward the Fallopian tubes (FTs) (~pH 7.94), reflecting variation in the site-specific microbiome and acid-base buffering at the tissue/cellular level. The temperature variation in humans is cyclical by day and month. In humans, it is biphasic, increasing in the luteal phase; with the caudal region of the oviduct 1-2 degrees cooler than the cranial portion. Temperature variation is influenced by hormones, density of pelvic/uterine vascular beds and effectiveness of heat exchange locally, crucial for sperm motility and embryo development. We have identified significant deficiencies and inconsistencies in the methods used to assess these biophysical factors within the reproductive tract. We have suggested that the technological solutions including the development of methods and models for real time, in vivo recordings of biophysical parameters. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The notion of 'back to nature' in assisted conception suggested 20 years ago has yet to be translated into clinical practice. While the findings from this systematic review do not provide evidence to change current in vitro protocols, it highlights our current inability to assess the in vivo reproductive tract environment in real time. Data made available through future development of sensing technology in utero may help to provide new insights into how best to optimize the in vitro embryo environment and allow for more precise and personalized fertility treatment. © The Author 2017.",Biophysical parameters; Conception; Female reproductive tract; In vivo; Monitoring; Oxygen; PH; Reproduction; Technology; Temperature,"oxygen; oxygen; Article; brain temperature; cell level; conception; Fallopian tube; female; female fertility; female genital system; heat exchange; human; in vivo study; microbiome; oxygen tension; physical chemistry; priority journal; systematic review; vagina pH; body temperature; embryo transfer; fertilization; infertility therapy; metabolism; nidation; pH; physiology; pregnancy; pregnancy rate; procedures; reproduction; standards; uterus; Body Temperature; Embryo Implantation; Embryo Transfer; Female; Fertilization; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Oxygen; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Rate; Reproductive Physiological Phenomena; Reproductive Techniques, Assisted; Uterus",Oxford University Press
C8-Guanine modifications: Effect on Z-DNA formation and its role in cancer,"Vongsutilers V., Gannett P.M.",2018,Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry,"Base modifications are known to affect the structure and function of DNA. C8-guanine adducts from various carcinogenic compounds have been shown to be potent Z-DNA inducers. Hence, it has been hypothesized that Z-DNA plays a role in cancer and other genetic diseases. In this comprehensive review, Z-DNA and the effect of prevalent C8-guanine adducts on the B-Z transition are addressed. The discoveries of Z-DNA binding proteins including ADAR1, E3L, DLM1, and PKZ have suggested the relevance of Z-DNA in living systems. In addition, increasing evidence on the Z-DNA connection to gene transcription and inhibition reveals potential biological functions of the left-handed DNA. Finally, C8-guanine adducts that promote Z-DNA formation can be used as a tool to explore the Z-DNA function and its role in carcinogenesis. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"carcinogen; DNA binding protein; DNA Z; guanine; animal; chemistry; DNA adduct; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; metabolism; neoplasm; Animals; Carcinogens; DNA Adducts; DNA, Z-Form; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation; Guanine; Humans; Neoplasms",Royal Society of Chemistry

Oral allergy syndrome,"Muluk N.B., Cingi C.",2018,American Journal of Rhinology and Allergy,"Objectives: To review oral allergy syndrome (OAS). Methods: We searched several medical literature data bases with the following key words: ""oral allergy syndrome,"" ""OAS,"" ""pollen-food allergy syndrome,"" ""PFAS,"" ""allergy,"" ""diagnosis,"" ""treatment."" Results: Oral allergy syndrome (OAS), also called ""pollen-food allergy syndrome,"" is a type of food allergy brought about by flavors, nuts, raw fruit, and vegetables. The most well-known symptoms are mouth and throat itching, which starts rapidly after a food is placed in the mouth, and that, as a rule, continues for just a couple of minutes after the food has been swallowed. The frequency of OAS with pollen allergy has been reported as 5-8%; 1-2% of patients with OAS with pollen allergy show extreme responses, e.g., anaphylaxis. Birch tree pollen, ragweed pollen, and grass pollen hypersensitivity cause the symptoms. The diagnosis of OAS is confirmed by a positive history and positive skin-prick test result triggered by the food's fresh extract. Oral challenge result is normally positive with the raw food and negative with the similar cooked food. Conclusion: Patients with grass allergy may have a response to peaches, oranges, celery, tomatoes, and melons. Patients with ragweed allergy may show OAS symptoms with melon, cucumber, banana, and zucchini.

Natural attenuation of chlorinated ethenes in hyporheic zones: A review of key biogeochemical processes and in-situ transformation potential,"Weatherill J.J., Atashgahi S., Schneidewind U., Krause S., Ullah S., Cassidy N., Rivett M.O.",2018,Water Research,"Chlorinated ethenes (CEs) are legacy contaminants whose chemical footprint is expected to persist in aquifers around the world for many decades to come. These organohalides have been reported in river systems with concerning prevalence and are thought to be significant chemical stressors in urban water ecosystems. The aquifer-river interface (known as the hyporheic zone) is a critical pathway for CE discharge to surface water bodies in groundwater baseflow. This pore water system may represent a natural bioreactor where anoxic and oxic biotransformation process act in synergy to reduce or even eliminate contaminant fluxes to surface water. Here, we critically review current process understanding of anaerobic CE respiration in the competitive framework of hyporheic zone biogeochemical cycling fuelled by in-situ fermentation of natural organic matter. We conceptualise anoxic-oxic interface development for metabolic and co-metabolic mineralisation by a range of aerobic bacteria with a focus on vinyl chloride degradation pathways. The superimposition of microbial metabolic processes occurring in sediment biofilms and bulk solute transport delivering reactants produces a scale dependence in contaminant transformation rates. Process interpretation is often confounded by the natural geological heterogeneity typical of most riverbed environments. We discuss insights from recent field experience of CE plumes discharging to surface water and present a range of practical monitoring technologies which address this inherent complexity at different spatial scales. Future research must address key dynamics which link supply of limiting reactants, residence times and microbial ecophysiology to better understand the natural attenuation capacity of hyporheic systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Biogeochemistry; Biotransformation; Chlorinated ethenes; Heterogeneity; Hyporheic zone; Natural attenuation,"Aerobic bacteria; Aquifers; Biodegradation; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Biological water treatment; Chlorine compounds; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Impurities; Metabolism; Solute transport; Stream flow; Surface waters; Biotransformation; Biotransformation process; Chlorinated ethenes; Geological heterogeneities; Heterogeneity; Hyporheic zone; Microbial metabolic process; Natural attenuation capacities; Natural attenuation; chlorinated ethene; ethylene; ferric ion; hydrogen; natural organic matter; nitrate; organohalogen derivative; oxygen; short chain fatty acid; sulfate; surface water; unclassified drug; vinyl chloride; 1,2 dichloroethane; ethylene; ethylene derivative; ground water; vinylidene chloride; anoxic conditions; bacterium; biofilm; biogeochemistry; biotransformation; chemical compound; degradation; ecophysiology; ethylene; fermentation; fluvial deposit; groundwater flow; heterogeneity; hyporheic zone; microbial activity; monitoring system; natural attenuation; pollutant property; porewater; respiration; river bed; solute transport; water chemistry; aerobic bacterium; aerobic metabolism; biofilm; biogeochemical cycling; biotransformation; chemical interaction; chlorination; fermentation; food web; hydrology; mass; nonhuman; plume; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); Review; sediment; anaerobic growth; bioremediation; ecosystem; halogenation; metabolism; microbiology; river; Anaerobiosis; Bacteria, Aerobic; Biodegradation, Environmental; Dichloroethylenes; Ecosystem; Ethylene Dichlorides; Ethylenes; Fermentation; Groundwater; Halogenation; Rivers; Vinyl Chloride",Elsevier Ltd
Environmental chemicals and breast cancer: An updated review of epidemiological literature informed by biological mechanisms,"Rodgers K.M., Udesky J.O., Rudel R.A., Brody J.G.",2018,Environmental Research,"Background Many common environmental chemicals are mammary gland carcinogens in animal studies, activate relevant hormonal pathways, or enhance mammary gland susceptibility to carcinogenesis. Breast cancer's long latency and multifactorial etiology make evaluation of these chemicals in humans challenging. Objective For chemicals previously identified as mammary gland toxicants, we evaluated epidemiologic studies published since our 2007 review. We assessed whether study designs captured relevant exposures and disease features suggested by toxicological and biological evidence of genotoxicity, endocrine disruption, tumor promotion, or disruption of mammary gland development. Methods We systematically searched the PubMed database for articles with breast cancer outcomes published in 2006–2016 using terms for 134 environmental chemicals, sources, or biomarkers of exposure. We critically reviewed the articles. Results We identified 158 articles. Consistent with experimental evidence, a few key studies suggested higher risk for exposures during breast development to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dioxins, perfluorooctane-sulfonamide (PFOSA), and air pollution (risk estimates ranged from 2.14 to 5.0), and for occupational exposure to solvents and other mammary carcinogens, such as gasoline components (risk estimates ranged from 1.42 to 3.31). Notably, one 50-year cohort study captured exposure to DDT during several critical windows for breast development (in utero, adolescence, pregnancy) and when this chemical was still in use. Most other studies did not assess exposure during a biologically relevant window or specify the timing of exposure. Few studies considered genetic variation, but the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project reported higher breast cancer risk for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in women with certain genetic variations, especially in DNA repair genes. Conclusions New studies that targeted toxicologically relevant chemicals and captured biological hypotheses about genetic variants or windows of breast susceptibility added to evidence of links between environmental chemicals and breast cancer. However, many biologically relevant chemicals, including current-use consumer product chemicals, have not been adequately studied in humans. Studies are challenged to reconstruct exposures that occurred decades before diagnosis or access biological samples stored that long. Other problems include measuring rapidly metabolized chemicals and evaluating exposure to mixtures. © 2017 The Authors",Breast development; Endocrine disruptors; Mammary carcinogens; Prevention; Toxicology,"1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 1,3 butadiene; 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; acrylamide; aromatic amine; carcinogen; chlorphenotane; dioxin; drinking water; endocrine disruptor; environmental chemical; ethylene oxide; flame retardant; gasoline; nonylphenol; organic solvent; organochlorine derivative; organochlorine pesticide; perfluoroalkyl substance; pesticide; phthalic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polyfluoroalkyl substance; solvent; styrene; unclassified drug; atmospheric pollution; cancer; database; DDT; DNA; endocrine disruptor; environmental fate; epidemiology; etiology; occupational exposure; risk factor; toxicology; tumor; adolescence; air pollution; breast cancer; breast carcinogenesis; breast development; cancer epidemiology; cancer risk; consumer; DNA repair; environmental exposure; genetic variation; geographic distribution; human; occupational exposure; pregnancy; priority journal; Review; systematic review; work environment; animal; breast tumor; chemically induced; female; genetics; mortality; pollutant; toxicity; Changdao Islands; China; Shandong; Animalia; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans",Academic Press Inc.
Empirical evidence in follow the Sun software development: A systematic mapping study,"Kroll J., Richardson I., Prikladnicki R., Audy J.L.N.",2018,Information and Software Technology,"Context Follow the Sun (FTS) development is a special case of Global Software Development. It is applied in the context of global projects to reduce the software development life-cycle duration. A number of studies have attempted to aggregate a better understanding of FTS development, but it is still an immature research area. Objective This paper aims to investigate the existing empirical evidence about FTS research with a focus on identifying what research has been conducted in the area and which results have been obtained. Method To achieve this goal, we performed a systematic mapping study to answer our research questions: “Which FTS studies have been published in the literature?” and “What empirical support is provided for them?” We investigated papers published between 1990 and 2017. The synthesis was made through classifying the papers into different categories (research topics, research methods, conferences and journals venues for FTS research, and countries involved in FTS research). Results We selected 57 papers using a predefined search strategy. The majority of the papers discussing FTS were published in the International Conference on Global Software Engineering (ICGSE). The main research topic addressed is processes and organization development for FTS. Case studies combined with the interview as a research sub-method is adopted in the most studies performed in FTS. The majority of the existing research and the most active researchers in this topic are from the United States and Brazil. However, India and the United States are the countries that appear most often in the studies conducted to investigate FTS. Conclusion Our findings suggest that FTS software development is an up-to-date research topic in Software Engineering. However, little information about FTS has been published over the last few years. The emergent need in this research is the development of evaluation research for testing FTS feasibility and effectiveness in practice. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Follow the sun; Global software development; Systematic mapping study; Time zone management; Virtual teams,Computer software; Human resource management; Life cycle; Mapping; Publishing; Software engineering; Evaluation research; Global software development; International conference on global software engineerings; Organization development; Software development life cycle; Systematic mapping studies; Time zones; Virtual team; Software design,Elsevier B.V.
Children's environmental health based on birth cohort studies of Asia,"Tsai M.-S., Chen M.-H., Lin C.-C., Ng S., Hsieh C.-J., Liu C.-Y., Hsieh W.-S., Chen P.-C.",2017,Science of the Total Environment,"Numerous studies have explored the associations between environmental pollutants and pediatric health. Recent studies have investigated the issue in Asia, but no systematic review has been published to date. This study aims to elucidate the issue by summarizing relevant epidemiologic evidence for cohorts in Asia, using information from the Birth Cohort Consortium of Asia (BiCCA). Environmental pollutants include mercury, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and phthalates. This study sought to classify the effects of such compounds on fetal growth and pregnancy outcomes, neurodevelopment and behavioral problems, allergic disease and immune function and the endocrine system and puberty. These evidences showed ETS has been associated with infant birth weight, children's neurodevelopment and allergy disease; mercury and PCB have been shown to affect children's neurodevelopment; phthalate has effects on endocrine function; PFAS alters children's neurodevelopment, the endocrine system, and the allergic response. However, more consistent and coordinated research is necessary to understand the whole picture of single environmental and/or co-exposure and children's health. Therefore, harmonization and international collaboration are also needed in Asia. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Asia; Birth cohort; Environmental tobacco smoke; Mercury; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Phthalates; Polychlorinated biphenyls,"Esters; Health; International cooperation; Mercury (metal); Organic pollutants; Smoke; Tobacco; Asia; Birth cohort; Environmental tobacco smokes; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Phthalates; Polychlorinated biphenyls; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; dioxin; environmental tobacco smoke; environmental, industrial and domestic chemicals; mercury; perfluoroalkyl substance; pesticide; phthalic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; tobacco smoke; unclassified drug; mercury; phthalic acid derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; child health; cohort analysis; environmental risk; epidemiology; merchant ship; PCB; phthalate; smoke; tobacco; allergic disease; anthropometric parameters; Article; Asia; birth length; birth weight; child health; cohort analysis; endocrine system; environmental exposure; environmental health; evidence based medicine; fetus; fetus growth; gestational age; head circumference; health hazard; human; immune response; international cooperation; nerve cell differentiation; physical examination; pollutant; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; problem behavior; puberty; questionnaire; child; female; fetus development; passive smoking; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; Asia; Nicotiana tabacum; Asia; Child; Child Health; Cohort Studies; Environmental Health; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fetal Development; Humans; Mercury; Phthalic Acids; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Tobacco Smoke Pollution",Elsevier B.V.
Modeling of Catalytic Fixed-Bed Reactors for Fuels Production by Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis,"Méndez C.I., Ancheyta J., Trejo F.",2017,Energy and Fuels,"A comprehensive review of the various studies reported in the literature to date on the mathematical modeling of fixed-bed reactors for the production of fuels by the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) was carried out. It is quite clear that most of the proposed models are based on a set of assumptions that allow their wide simplification by reducing the models into forms of low complexity, due to the fact that in most cases the effects of phase equilibrium are neglected, and relatively simple Fischer-Tropsch kinetics of the power law type are used. In addition, most of the proposed modeling schemes neglect the effects of resistances to gas-liquid and liquid-solid mass transfer. On the other hand, few reports consider the energy effects under the consideration of a nonisothermal operation assuming a plug-flow behavior and a gas-liquid system. A generalized model of a fixed-bed FTS reactor is proposed which takes into account all the mass and heat transfer phenomena, as well as hydrodynamics and vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE), based on the information given in the literature. It is evident that for fixed-bed reactors for fuel production using Fischer-Tropsch technology, there is little experimental information for validation and a need to explore different types of reactor models, such as reactor models under a trickle-flow regime considering the effects of phase distribution and dispersion under transient-state conditions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Chemical reactors; Fuels; Heat transfer; Liquids; Mass transfer; Phase equilibria; Catalytic fixed bed reactors; Fixed bed reactor; Fuel production; Gas-liquid systems; Generalized models; Liquid-solid mass transfer; Mass and heat transfers; Phase distribution; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis,American Chemical Society
Novel treatment technologies for PFAS compounds: A critical review,"Kucharzyk K.H., Darlington R., Benotti M., Deeb R., Hawley E.",2017,Journal of Environmental Management,"Perfluorinated compounds such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) have recently drawn great attention due to their wide distribution in aquatic environments. The understanding of the physicochemical properties and fate and transport of PFAs in groundwater is still limited. Preliminary studies indicate that these compounds can readily bioaccumulate and pose human and animal health concerns. Due to their physicochemical properties, PFOS and PFOA are water soluble, nonvolatile and persistent in the environment, which is a cause of concern related to their treatment with conventional remediation technologies. Extraction with inefficient carbon adsorption is one of the most common treatment technologies for remediation of PFOS- or PFOA-impacted groundwater. Several other innovative and promising technologies, including sonochemistry, bioremediation and photolysis, have been tested for their effectiveness in removal of perfluorinated compounds. This paper provides a baseline for understanding research needs to better develop treatment technologies for PFOA and PFOS in groundwater. Frontiers for improving the state of practice for PFOA and PFOS treatment include the development of more cost-effective ex situ treatment methods and the development and demonstration of promising in situ treatment technologies at the pilot and full scale. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Groundwater treatment; Perfluorinated compounds; PFOA; PFOS; Removal technologies,"carbon; ground water; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; ground water; octanoic acid derivative; water; adsorption; aquatic environment; bioremediation; groundwater; literature review; organic compound; photolysis; physicochemical property; pollutant removal; adsorption; Article; cost effectiveness analysis; photolysis; physical chemistry; water treatment; animal; human; water pollutant; Animalia; Adsorption; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Groundwater; Humans; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Academic Press
Thyroid disrupting chemicals,"Calsolaro V., Pasqualetti G., Niccolai F., Caraccio N., Monzani F.",2017,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,"Endocrine disruptor compounds are exogenous agents able to interfere with a gland function, exerting their action across different functional passages, from the synthesis to the metabolism and binding to receptors of the hormone produced. Several issues, such as different levels and time of exposure and different action across different ages as well as gender, make the study of endocrine disruptors still a challenge. The thyroid is very sensitive to the action of disruptors, and considering the importance of a correct thyroid function for physical and cognitive functioning, addressing this topic should be considered a priority. In this review, we examined the most recent studies, many of them concentrating on maternal and child exposure, conducted to assess the impact of industrial chemicals which showed an influence on thyroid function. So far, the number of studies conducted on that topic is not sufficient to provide solid conclusions and lead to homogeneous guidelines. The lack of uniformity is certainly due to differences in areas and populations examined, the different conditions of exposures and the remarkable inter-subject variability. Nonetheless, the European Commission for Health and Food Safety is implementing recommendations to ensure that substances identified as endocrine disruptors will be withdrawn from the market. © 2017 by the authors.

Multiple-stressor effects in an apex predator: Combined influence of pollutants and sea ice decline on lipid metabolism in polar bears,"Tartu S., Lille-Langøy R., Størseth T.R., Bourgeon S., Brunsvik A., Aars J., Goksøyr A., Jenssen B.M., Polder A., Thiemann G.W., Torget V., Routti H.",2017,Scientific Reports,"There is growing evidence from experimental and human epidemiological studies that many pollutants can disrupt lipid metabolism. In Arctic wildlife, the occurrence of such compounds could have serious consequences for seasonal feeders. We set out to study whether organohalogenated compounds (OHCs) could cause disruption of energy metabolism in female polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from Svalbard, Norway (n = 112). We analyzed biomarkers of energy metabolism including the abundance profiles of nine lipid-related genes, fatty acid (FA) synthesis and elongation indices in adipose tissue, and concentrations of lipid-related variables in plasma (cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides). Furthermore, the plasma metabolome and lipidome were characterized by low molecular weight metabolites and lipid fingerprinting, respectively. Polychlorinated biphenyls, chlordanes, brominated diphenyl ethers and perfluoroalkyl substances were significantly related to biomarkers involved in lipid accumulation, FA metabolism, insulin utilization, and cholesterol homeostasis. Moreover, the effects of pollutants were measurable at the metabolome and lipidome levels. Our results indicate that several OHCs affect lipid biosynthesis and catabolism in female polar bears. Furthermore, these effects were more pronounced when combined with reduced sea ice extent and thickness, suggesting that climate-driven sea ice decline and OHCs have synergistic negative effects on polar bears. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"biological marker; animal; Arctic; bear; energy metabolism; environment; ice cover; lipid metabolism; mental stress; metabolome; metabolomics; physiological stress; physiology; pollutant; predation; procedures; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Animals; Arctic Regions; Biomarkers; Energy Metabolism; Environment; Environmental Pollutants; Ice Cover; Lipid Metabolism; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Predatory Behavior; Stress, Physiological; Stress, Psychological; Svalbard; Ursidae",Nature Publishing Group
Comparison of clinical outcomes with InterTan vs Gamma nail or PFNA in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures: A meta-analysis,"Ma J.-X., Kuang M.-J., Fan Z.-R., Xing F., Zhao Y.-L., Zhang L.-K., Chen H.-T., Han C., Ma X.-L.",2017,Scientific Reports,"Intertrochanteric fractures are common injuries in the elderly. Conventional intramedullary nails including Gamma 3 locking nail and proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) were designed for unstable intertrochanteric fractures. The InterTan (IT) nail system, introduced in 2005, has been reported superior biomechanical and clinical outcomes compared with 1-screw nailing system.

Influence of enhanced recovery after surgery programs on laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy for gastric cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials,"Li Z., Wang Q., Li B., Bai B., Zhao Q.",2017,World Journal of Surgical Oncology,"Background: This meta-analysis is aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs in gastric cancer patients undergoing laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG). Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized control trials involving either enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS)/fast track surgery (FTS) for patients underwent LAG. EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of science, and Cochrane Library were searched. Primary outcomes included the length of postoperative hospital stay, cost of hospitalization, postoperative complications, and readmission rate. Results: Five randomized control trials were eligible for analysis. There were 159 cases in FTS group and 156 cases in conventional care group. Compared with conventional care group, FTS group relates to shorter postoperative hospital stay (WMD - 2.16; 95% CI - 3.05 to - 1.26, P < 0.00001), less cost of hospitalization (WMD - 4.72; 95% CI - 6.88 to - 2.55, P < 0.00001), shorter time to first flatus (WMD - 9.72; 95% CI - 13.75 to - 5.81, P < 0.00001), lower level of C-reaction protein on postoperative days 3 or 4 (WMD - 19.66; 95% CI - 28.98 to - 10.34, P < 0.00001), higher level of albumin on postoperative day 4 (WMD 3.45; 95% CI 2.01 to 4.89, P < 0.00001), and postoperative day 7 (WMD 5.63; 95% CI 1.01 to 10.24, P = 0.02). Regarding postoperative complications, no significant differences were observed between FTS group and conventional care group (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.09, P = 0.10). The readmission rate of FTS group was comparable to conventional care group (WMD 3.14; 95% CI 0.12 to 81.35, P = 0.49). Conclusions: Among patients undergoing LAG, FTS is associated with shorter postoperative hospital stay, rapid postoperative recovery, and decreased cost without increasing complications or readmission rate. The combined effects of the two methods could further accelerate clinical recovery of gastric cancer patients. © 2017 The Author(s).",Enhanced recovery after surgery; Fast track surgery; Gastric cancer; Laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy,albumin; C reactive protein; interleukin 6; clinical effectiveness; clinical protocol; convalescence; enhanced recovery after surgery; feasibility study; gastrectomy; health care cost; health program; hospital readmission; human; laparoscopic surgery; length of stay; meta analysis; outcome assessment; patient safety; postoperative complication; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; stomach cancer; systematic review; economics; gastrectomy; hospitalization; laparoscopy; operation duration; postoperative care; postoperative complication; procedures; prognosis; program evaluation; statistics and numerical data; stomach tumor; time factor; treatment outcome; Feasibility Studies; Gastrectomy; Hospitalization; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Operative Time; Patient Readmission; Postoperative Care; Postoperative Complications; Prognosis; Program Evaluation; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stomach Neoplasms; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome,BioMed Central Ltd.
"The occurrence, exposure and risk assessment of perfluoroalkyl acids in food from mainland, China","Wang X., Zhang R., Zhang H., Wang Y.",2017,"Food Additives and Contaminants - Part A Chemistry, Analysis, Control, Exposure and Risk Assessment","To study the contamination of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in Chinese food and the risk of dietary exposure for the Chinese population, the data of 17 PFAAs covering 38 cities throughout China in 15 groups of foods were collected for meta-analysis from published and available research literature. Using food consumption and body weight parameters, estimated dietary intakes (EDIs) were calculated for evaluation using the Scenario-Based Risk Assessment (SceBRA) modelling. Among food groups, the highest ΣPFAAs concentrations and EDI contributions were both found in poultry (363 ng/g), fish and shrimp (313 ng/g), dark vegetables (309 ng/g), fruits (116 ng/g) and pork (25 ng/g). The EDI of adults in the high-exposure scenario was about twice that of the intermediate-exposure scenario, while the EDI of children was about twice that of adults’ EDI in the intermediate-exposure scenario. In addition, the PFOS EDI for children under high exposure approached its tolerable daily intake (TDI). Therefore high dietary exposure to PFAAs is giving rise to an increased health risk, especially for children. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Chinese food; dietary exposure; estimated dietary intake (EDI); health risk assessment; Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs); perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS),Food supply; Health risks; Population statistics; Risk management; Risk perception; Dietary exposure; Estimated dietary intakes; Exposure and risk assessments; Food consumption; High exposures; Perfluoroalkyl acids; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; Tolerable daily intake; Risk assessment; perfluoroalkane sulfonic acid; perfluoroalkanoic acid; perfluoroalkyl acid derivative; perfluorobutyric acid; perfluorodecane sulfonic acid; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorododecanoic acid; perfluoroheptanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoropentanoic acid; perfluorotetradecanoic acid; perfluorotridecanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; pollutant; adolescent; adult; Article; body weight; child; China; female; fish; food contamination; food intake; health hazard; human; male; meat industry; nonhuman; pork; poultry product; priority journal; risk assessment; shrimp; vegetable; analysis; eating; environmental exposure; food contamination; pollutant; China; Eating; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Food Contamination; Humans; Risk Assessment,Taylor and Francis Ltd.
Bringing value-based perspectives to care: Including patient and family members in decision-making processes,"Kohler G., Sampalli T., Ryer A., Porter J., Wood L., Bedford L., Higgins-Bowser I., Edwards L., Christian E., Dunn S., Gibson R., Carson S.R., Vallis M., Zed J., Tugwell B., Van Zoost C., Canfield C., Rivoire E.",2017,International Journal of Health Policy and Management,"Background: Recent evidence shows that patient engagement is an important strategy in achieving a high performing healthcare system. While there is considerable evidence of implementation initiatives in direct care context, there is limited investigation of implementation initiatives in decision-making context as it relates to program planning, service delivery and developing policies. Research has also shown a gap in consistent application of system-level strategies that can effectively translate organizational policies around patient and family engagement into practice. Methods: The broad objective of this initiative was to develop a system-level implementation strategy to include patient and family advisors (PFAs) at decision-making points in primary healthcare (PHC) based on well-established evidence and literature. In this opportunity sponsored by the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement (CFHI) a co-design methodology, also well-established was applied in identifying and developing a suitable implementation strategy to engage PFAs as members of quality teams in PHC. Diabetes management centres (DMCs) was selected as the pilot site to develop the strategy. Key steps in the process included review of evidence, review of the current state in PHC through engagement of key stakeholders and a co-design approach. Results: The project team included a diverse representation of members from the PHC system including patient advisors, DMC team members, system leads, providers, Public Engagement team members and CFHI improvement coaches. Key outcomes of this 18-month long initiative included development of a working definition of patient and family engagement, development of a Patient and Family Engagement Resource Guide and evaluation of the resource guide. Conclusion: This novel initiative provided us an opportunity to develop a supportive system-wide implementation plan and a strategy to include PFAs in decision-making processes in PHC. The well-established co-design methodology further allowed us to include value-based (customer driven quality and experience of care) perspectives of several important stakeholders including patient advisors. The next step will be to implement the strategy within DMCs, spread the strategy PHC, both locally and provincially with a focus on sustainability. © 2017 The Author(s); Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.",Decision-Making; Patient and Family Engagement; Patient Experience; Quality Teams,Canada; decision making; diabetes mellitus; family; human; information processing; organization and management; patient participation; patient satisfaction; primary health care; procedures; professional-patient relationship; Canada; Decision Making; Diabetes Mellitus; Family; Focus Groups; Humans; Patient Participation; Patient Satisfaction; Primary Health Care; Professional-Patient Relations,Kerman University of Medical Sciences
Bomb swab: Can trace explosive particle sampling and detection be improved?,"Fisher D., Zach R., Matana Y., Elia P., Shustack S., Sharon Y., Zeiri Y.",2017,Talanta,"The marked increase in international terror in recent years requires the development of highly efficient methods to detect trace amounts of explosives at airports, border crossings and check points. The preferred analytical method worldwide is the ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) that is capable of detecting most explosives at the nano-gram level. Sample collection for the IMS analysis is based on swabbing of a passenger's belongings to collect possible explosive residues. The present study examines a wide range of issues related to swab-based particle collection and analysis, in the hope of gaining deeper understanding into this technique that will serve to improve the detection process. The adhesion of explosive particles to three typical materials, plastic, metal and glass, were measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We found that a strong contribution of capillary forces to adhesion on glass and metal surfaces renders these substrates more promising materials upon which to find and collect explosive residues. The adhesion of explosives to different swipe materials was also examined. Here we found that Muslin, Nomex® and polyamide membrane surfaces are the most promising materials for use as swipes. Subsequently, the efficiency of multiple swipe use – for collecting explosive residues from a glass surface using Muslin, Nomex® and Teflon™ swipes – was examined. The study suggests that swipes used in about 5–10 “sampling and analysis cycles” have higher efficiency as compared to new unused swipes. The reason for this behavior was found to be related to the increased roughness of the swipe surface following a few swab measurements. Lastly, GC-MS analysis was employed to examine the nature of contaminants collected by the three types of swipe. The relative amounts of different contaminants are reported. The existence and interference of these contaminants have to be considered in relation to the detection efficiency of the various explosives by the IMS. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Adhesion force; AFM; IMS; Particle sampling; Swipe material; Trace explosives detection,Adhesion; Atomic force microscopy; Collector efficiency; Efficiency; Explosives; Glass; Ion mobility spectrometers; Metal analysis; Adhesion forces; Detection efficiency; Explosive residues; Ion mobility spectrometry; Particle collection; Particle sampling; Polyamide membranes; Sample collection; Explosives detection,Elsevier B.V.
Meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of PFNA and InterTAN for the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures,"Shi J.-J., Wang Y.-Z., Li Y., Gao Y.-P., Wang D., Wang Z.-Y., Zhang Z.-Q.",2017,Zhongguo gu shang = China journal of orthopaedics and traumatology,"OBJECTIVE: To system evaluate the clinical effect and safety of PFNA and InterTAN internal fixation methods for femoral intertrochanteric fracture.METHODS: According to the Cochrane systemic analysis method, randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials which were about the comparison of PFNA and InterTAN for intertrochanteric fracture were collected from Cochrane Library(2017, issue 4), PubMed (January, 2003-May, 2017), Wanfang Med Online (January, 2003-May, 2017) and China Academic Journals Full-text Database(January, 2003-May, 2017) by computer searching. Cross-checking was done after assessing the quality of the included trials and extracting the data by two reviewers independently. Data analysis were performed with RevMan 5.3.RESULTS: Two randomized controlled trials and five quasi-randomized controlled trials involving 611 cases met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analyses showed no significant differences between the two methods on Harris scores[MD=-1.00, 95%CI(-2.29, 0.28), P=0.13], union time[MD=0.04, 95%CI (-0.70, 0.77), P=0.92], full weight-bearing time[MD=1.06, 95%CI(-0.29, 2.42), P=0.13], hospital stay[MD=-0.04, 95%CI (-0.52, 0.45), P=0.89] and length of incision[MD=-1.00, 95%CI (-2.64, 0.65), P=0.23]. There were significant differences between the two methods on operative time[MD=-25.75, 95%CI (-37.47, -14.03), P<0.000 1], intraoperative blood loss[MD=-55.67, 95%CI(-108.07, -3.27), P=0.04] and the internal fixation complication rate[MD=4.17, 95%CI (1.33, 13.08), P=0.01].CONCLUSIONS: Both PFNA and InterTAN could provide good effect for intertrochanteric fracture. The operation time of PFNA is shorter than that of InterTAN, and there is less blood loss during operation. PFNA may be the first choice for the treatment of patients who have many complications and can't endure long-time operation. The complications of PFNA are more than those of InterTAN. In patients with long life expectancy and high requirements, InterTAN may be preferentially selected to reduce complications. According to the patient's situation, after a comprehensive consideration, appropriate treatment can be selected.","Femoral intertrochanteric fractures; Fracture fixation, internal; Meta-analysis","bone nail; China; hip fracture; human; meta analysis; osteosynthesis; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); Bone Nails; China; Fracture Fixation, Internal; Hip Fractures; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",

EDs are strong participants in the obesity epidemic scenery by interfering with cellular morphological and biochemical processes, by inducing inﬂammatory responses, and by presenting transcriptional and oncogenic activity. Obesity and lipotoxicity enhancement occur through reprogramming and/or remodeling of germline epigenome by exposure to EDs. Specific population groups are vulnerable to ED exposure due to current dietary and environmental conditions. Obesity, morbidity and carcinogenicity induced by ED exposure are an evolving reality. Therefore, a new collective strategic approach is deemed essential, for the reappraisal of current global conditions pertaining to energy management. © 2017 by the authors.

Adsorption of emerging pollutants on activated carbon,"Jeirani Z., Niu C.H., Soltan J.",2017,Reviews in Chemical Engineering,"Many emerging pollutants (also known as micro-pollutants) including pesticides, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have frequently been detected in surface, ground, and drinking water at alarming concentrations. The emission and accumulation of these anthropogenic chemicals in nature is a potential threat to human health and aquatic environment. Therefore, it is essential to devise an effective and feasible technology to remove the micro-pollutants from water. Activated carbon adsorption has been introduced and utilized as a promising treatment to reduce the concentration of the emerging pollutants in water. A summary of research on the removal of pesticides, PPCPs, and EDCs by activated carbon adsorption process is presented in this report. The effects of carbon characteristics, adsorptive properties, and environmental factors on the adsorption capacity of activated carbon are reviewed. In addition, the mechanisms of the adsorption including hydrophobicity and the nature of the functional groups of activated carbon and organic compounds are discussed. Furthermore, the applied equilibrium adsorption isotherms (Langmuir, Freundlich, BET, Sips, Dubinin-Astakhov, Dubinin-Radushkevich, and Toth) and the most common kinetic models (pseudo-first- and second-order models, film and intra-particle diffusion models, and adsorption-desorption model) are also included for further investigation. This comprehensive review report aims to identify the knowledge deficiencies regarding emerging pollutant treatment via activated carbon adsorption process and open new horizons for the future research on the adsorption of emerging pollutants on activated carbon. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.",Activated carbon adsorption; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Pesticides; Pharmaceutical and personal care products,Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Adsorption; Chemicals; Effluent treatment; Endocrine disrupters; Health risks; Organic carbon; Pesticides; Pollution; Pollution control; Potable water; Activated carbon adsorption; Adsorption desorption; Adsorptive properties; Anthropogenic chemicals; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Equilibrium adsorption isotherms; Intra-particle diffusion; Pharmaceutical and personal care products; Water pollution,Walter de Gruyter GmbH
"Comparative outcome of PFNA, Gamma nails, PCCP, Medoff plate, LISS and dynamic hip screws for fixation in elderly trochanteric fractures: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","Arirachakaran A., Amphansap T., Thanindratarn P., Piyapittayanun P., Srisawat P., Kongtharvonskul J.",2017,European Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology,"The ideal implant for the treatment of an unstable intertrochanteric femoral fracture is still a matter of discussion. The aim of this systematic review is to conduct a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing clinical outcomes between dynamic hip screws (DHS), Medoff sliding plating, percutaneous compression plating (PCCP), proximal femoral nails (PFN), Gamma nails and less invasive stabilization system fixation in femoral trochanteric fractures in the elderly. These clinical outcomes consist of total intra-operative time, intra-operative fluoroscopy time, intra-operative blood loss, blood component transfusion, length of hospital stay, postoperative general complications, wound complications, late complications and reoperation rates. This systematic review was conducted using PubMed and Scopus search engines for RCTs comparing clinical outcomes between treatments from inception to February 22, 2015. Thirty-six of 785 studies identified were eligible. Compared to the other implants, PCCP showed the lowest total operative time and units of blood transfusion with an unstandardized mean difference (UMD) of 29.27 min (95% CI 5.24, 53.50) and 0.89 units (95% CI 0.52, 1.25). The lowest incidence of general complications, wound complications and late complications of PCCP was 0.09 (95% CI 0.04, 0.18), 0.01 (95% CI 0.01, 0.04) and 0.05 (95% CI 0.02, 0.11), respectively, when compared to others. The lowest fluoroscopic time was with DHS with an UMD of 0.24 min (95% CI 0.16, 0.32), whereas the lowest blood loss and shortest hospital stay were with PFN with an UMD of 233.61 ml of blood loss (95% CI 153.17, 314.04) and 7.23 days of hospital stay (95% CI 7.15, 7.31) when compared to all other fixation methods. Reoperation rates of all implants had no statistically significant difference. The network meta-analysis suggested that fixation with PCCP significantly shortens operative time and decreases the units of blood transfusion required, while also lowering risks of general complications, wound complications and late complications when compared to fixation. Use of PFN showed the least intra-operative blood loss and shortest hospital stay. Multiple active treatment comparisons indicate that PCCP fixation in trochanteric fractures in the elderly is the treatment of choice in terms of intra-operative outcomes and postoperative complications. © 2017, Springer-Verlag France.",DHS; Gamma nail; LISS; Medoff sliding plate; PCCP; PFN; Trochanteric fractures,"Article; blood component therapy; bone nail; bone plate; bone screw; comparative effectiveness; femur intertrochanteric fracture; fixation failure; fracture fixation; fracture nonunion; hematoma; human; length of stay; meta analysis; operation duration; operative blood loss; pneumonia; postoperative complication; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); reoperation; systematic review; thromboembolism; wound complication; wound dehiscence; wound infection; blood transfusion; devices; female; fluoroscopy; hip fracture; male; network meta-analysis; osteosynthesis; postoperative complication; procedures; statistics and numerical data; Blood Loss, Surgical; Blood Transfusion; Bone Nails; Bone Plates; Bone Screws; Female; Fluoroscopy; Fracture Fixation, Internal; Hip Fractures; Humans; Length of Stay; Male; Network Meta-Analysis; Operative Time; Postoperative Complications; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",Springer-Verlag France
State of the evidence 2017: An update on the connection between breast cancer and the environment,"Gray J.M., Rasanayagam S., Engel C., Rizzo J.",2017,Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source,"Background: In this review, we examine the continually expanding and increasingly compelling data linking radiation and various chemicals in our environment to the current high incidence of breast cancer. Singly and in combination, these toxicants may have contributed significantly to the increasing rates of breast cancer observed over the past several decades. Exposures early in development from gestation through adolescence and early adulthood are particularly of concern as they re-shape the program of genetic, epigenetic and physiological processes in the developing mammary system, leading to an increased risk for developing breast cancer. In the 8 years since we last published a comprehensive review of the relevant literature, hundreds of new papers have appeared supporting this link, and in this update, the evidence on this topic is more extensive and of better quality than that previously available. Conclusion: Increasing evidence from epidemiological studies, as well as a better understanding of mechanisms linking toxicants with development of breast cancer, all reinforce the conclusion that exposures to these substances - many of which are found in common, everyday products and byproducts - may lead to increased risk of developing breast cancer. Moving forward, attention to methodological limitations, especially in relevant epidemiological and animal models, will need to be addressed to allow clearer and more direct connections to be evaluated. © 2017 The Author(s).",Bisphenol a; Breast cancer; Endocrine disrupting compounds; Environmental toxicants; Light-at-night; Radiation,"1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; aldrin; alkylphenol; aromatic amine; atrazine; cadmium; chlorphenotane; chromium; dieldrin; diethylstilbestrol; estrogen; ethinylestradiol; gestagen; iron; malathion; mercury; nickel; oral contraceptive agent; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; phthalic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; sunscreen; triclocarban; triclosan; unindexed drug; zinc; adolescence; cancer; disease incidence; endocrine disruptor; epidemiology; nightglow; phenolic compound; physiology; pregnancy; radiation exposure; toxicity; African American; body mass; breast cancer; breast density; cancer incidence; cancer risk; cancer susceptibility; carcinogenicity; case control study; cell interaction; cohort analysis; computed tomographic angiography; computer assisted tomography; electromagnetism; epigenetics; female infertility; fluoroscopy; genotype environment interaction; gestational age; hormone substitution; human; in vitro study; ionizing radiation; longitudinal study; mammography; Mexican American; nonhuman; occupational exposure; ovariectomy; ovary cancer; ovulation induction; physical activity; postmenopause; practice guideline; premenopause; priority journal; prospective study; retrospective study; Review; risk benefit analysis; smoking; systematic review; ultraviolet radiation; breast tumor; chemically induced; dangerous goods; environmental exposure; female; incidence; pollutant; toxicity; Animalia; Breast Neoplasms; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Hazardous Substances; Humans; Incidence",BioMed Central Ltd.
Endoscopic Treatment of Vesicoureteral Reflux,"Arlen A.M., Kirsch A.J.",2017,Current Bladder Dysfunction Reports,"Purpose of Review: Optimal management of primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) remains a source of debate, and options include observation with or without continuous antibiotic prophylaxis and surgical repair via endoscopic, open, or laparoscopic/robotic approaches. Surgical intervention may be necessary in children with persistent reflux, renal scarring, or recurrent febrile urinary tract infections when other options fail. Recent Findings: Need for surgical correction is dictated predominantly by a given child’s clinical course including risk for recurrent infections and potential for renal scarring. While recent studies suggest that endoscopic injection is effective for the treatment of most VUR, the importance of material injected, technique utilized, reflux grade, and structural/functional bladder anomalies on ultimate success rates must be emphasized. Summary: Long-term clinical success following endoscopic correction of primary VUR is high, and the majority of children avoid additional or more invasive surgical procedures. Efficacy rates are known to vary widely between surgeons, techniques, and implant materials. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Dextranomer hyaluronic acid copolymer (Dx/HA); Endoscopic correction; Pediatric; Polyacrylate-polyalcohol copolymer (PPC); Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR),copolymer; dextranomer; hyaluronic acid; politef; polyacrylic acid; polyol; anti vesicoureteral reflux gel; clinical effectiveness; double hydrodistention method; endoscopic surgery; human; kidney transplantation; meta analysis (topic); neurogenic bladder; outcome assessment; patient positioning; pyelonephritis; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent infection; Review; scar formation; STING technique; surgical technique; systematic review (topic); treatment failure; urinary tract infection; urodynamics; urological therapeutic device; vesicoureteral reflux,Current Medicine Group LLC 1
Soil ecotoxicity of seven endocrine-disrupting chemicals: a review,"Kwak J.I., Moon J., Kim D., An Y.-J.",2017,European Journal of Soil Science,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are widely used in manufacturing, and they enter the soil by direct and indirect pathways. Thus, there are concerns about their potential effects on soil ecosystems and some studies have monitored EDCs in the soil environment. However, there have been few studies on soil ecotoxicity of EDCs so far compared with aquatic ecotoxicity, and there is no comprehensive review of soil ecotoxicity of EDCs. Therefore, we collected, compiled and reviewed 77 studies on the soil ecotoxicity of seven prominent EDCs: bisphenol A, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), nonylphenols, triclosan, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS). This review brings together the data on soil ecotoxicity and research trends for these seven EDCs and identifies the need for further research to fill the gaps in our knowledge and data. Highlights: Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) pose potential threats to soil ecosystems. Seventy-seven studies on the soil ecotoxicity of seven EDCs were reviewed. There are fewer studies on soil ecotoxicity than on aquatic ecotoxicity. Further research including various environmentally relevant concentrations of EDCs is needed. © 2017 British Society of Soil Science",,concentration (composition); environmental effect; manufacturing; phenolic compound; phthalate; research work; soil ecosystem; soil type; toxicity,Blackwell Publishing Ltd
Updates in the Evaluation of Older Women with Pelvic Floor Disorders,"Parker-Autry C., Tan J.",2017,Current Geriatrics Reports,"Purpose of Review: Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) are common among older women, and pose a unique challenge to the healthcare provider. The onset of PFDs in older women is gradual resulting from an inter-related process of anatomic, hormonal, and functional changes that occur over time and often impacted by concomitant medical co-morbid conditions. In this evidenced-based review, we provide an update on the epidemiology and provide an evidence-based approach to the evaluation of women with PFDs with a specific focus on the impact of aging. Recent Findings: Physical function impairment is prevalent among older women with pelvic floor symptoms. The decline in physical function is likely the consequence of global changes in skeletal muscle health with aging, but may uniquely impact the pelvic floor muscle physiology and function. Summary: Providers caring for older women with PFDs must account for the impact of the aging process on symptom presentation and evaluation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Aging; Evaluation; Older women; Urinary incontinence,aged; aging; anorectal pressure; clinical evaluation; comorbidity; cystoscopy; defecography; digital rectal examination; echography; evidence based medicine; feces incontinence; female; human; intestine transit time; medical history; menopause; menstruation; mixed incontinence; nocturia; overactive bladder; patient preference; patient referral; pelvic examination; pelvic floor disorder; pelvic organ prolapse; priority journal; quality of life; rectoscopy; Review; sexual function; sigmoidoscopy; skeletal muscle; social aspect; social stigma; stress incontinence; urinary urgency; urine incontinence; urodynamics; vagina disease; vaginal delivery,Springer New York LLC
Reducing chemical exposures at home: Opportunities for action,"Zota A.R., Singla V., Adamkiewicz G., Mitro S.D., Dodson R.E.",2017,Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,"Indoor environments can influence human environmental chemical exposures and, ultimately, public health. Furniture, electronics, personal care and cleaning products, floor coverings and other consumer products contain chemicals that can end up in the indoor air and settled dust. Consumer product chemicals such as phthalates, phenols, flame retardants and per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances are widely detected in the US general population, including vulnerable populations, and are associated with adverse health effects such as reproductive and endocrine toxicity. We discuss the implications of our recent meta-analysis describing the patterns of chemical exposures and the ubiquity of multiple chemicals in indoor environments. To reduce the likelihood of exposures to these toxic chemicals, we then discuss approaches for exposure mitigation: targeting individual behaviour change, household maintenance and purchasing decisions, consumer advocacy and corporate responsibility in consumer markets, and regulatory action via state/federal policies. There is a need to further develop evidencebased strategies for chemical exposure reduction in each of these areas, given the multi-factorial nature of the problem. Further identifying those at greatest risk; understanding the individual, household and community factors that influence indoor chemical exposures; and developing options for mitigation may substantially improve individuals' exposures and health.",,chemical substance; dust; health impact; health risk; indoor air; meta-analysis; pollution effect; pollution exposure; public health; risk factor; toxic substance; behavior change; consumer advocacy; exposure; household; human; market; purchasing; responsibility; United States,BMJ Publishing Group
Obesity and pelvic organ prolapse,"Lee U.J., Kerkhof M.H., Van Leijsen S.A., Heesakkers J.P.",2017,Current Opinion in Urology,"Purpose of review The purpose of this review is to review the data on the relationship of obesity and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). This review is timely and relevant as the prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide, and it is an important risk factor to consider in counseling women on management of prolapse symptoms and outcomes for surgical treatment. Recent findings The main findings in the literature include: Obesity is increasing worldwide and impacts health, social life, work and healthcare costs. Elevated BMI is an important lifestyle factor affecting pelvic prolapse. The most probable mechanism of POP development among obese women is the increase in intra-abdominal pressure that causes weakening of pelvic floor muscles and fascia. Obesity is associated with significant pelvic floor symptoms and impairment of quality of life (QOL). Weight loss is likely not associated with anatomic improvement, but may be associated with prolapse symptom improvement. Weight loss should be considered a primary option in obese women for its beneficial effects on multiple organ systems and reducing pelvic floor disorder (PFD) symptoms. Although the operation time in obese women is significantly longer than in healthy weight women, the complication rate of surgery has not been shown to be increased compared to nonobese patients, regardless of route of surgery. There are data to support the vaginal approach in obese women. Some studies have shown that women with high body weight are associated with an increase in the risk for both anatomical and functional recurrence, and other studies have shown no difference. Summary Obesity is a prevalent modifiable condition that impacts PFDs including pelvic prolapse. Patients should be counseled using clinical judgment, knowledge of the literature and with the goal of improving QOL. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",BMI; obesity; pelvic floor disorders; pelvic organ prolapse; surgery; urogynecology; vaginal prolapse,female; health care cost; human; meta analysis (topic); multicenter study (topic); obesity; patient counseling; pelvic organ prolapse; pelvis surgery; prevalence; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent disease; Review; risk factor; social life; systematic review (topic); treatment outcome; weight reduction; work-life balance; obesity; pathophysiology; pelvic organ prolapse; pelvis floor; psychology; quality of life; urine incontinence; Female; Humans; Obesity; Pelvic Floor; Pelvic Organ Prolapse; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Urinary Incontinence,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins
Diagnostics of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in pediatrics: Recommendations for the practice according to the S3 guidelines [Diagnostik Fetaler Alkoholspektrumstörungen in der Kinder- und Jugendmedizin: Empfehlungen für die Praxis gemäß der S3-﻿Leitlinie],"Landgraf M.N., Heinen F.",2017,Monatsschrift fur Kinderheilkunde,"Background: Intrauterine alcohol exposure can lead to toxic damage to the fetal brain and therefore to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The estimated prevalence in Germany is 1 % and FASD persists for life. Not only pediatricians and child psychiatrists but also general practitioners, neurologists, psychiatrists, psychotherapists and gynecologists (plus broad areas of pedagogics and social work) are confronted with FASD. Material and methods: Based on a systematic review and methodological assessment of the literature from 2001–2015, the multidisciplinary guideline group formulated consensus recommendations for the diagnosis of FASD. In this publication the differential diagnostic criteria for partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) are presented. Results: The literature search for pFAS, ARND and ARBD resulted in 365 hits and 58 publications were included for the methodological assessment. For the diagnosis of pFAS, two out of three facial anomalies (i.e. short palpebral fissure length, thin upper lip and smooth philtrum), at least three abnormalities of the central nervous system (CNS) and a probable maternal alcohol consumption are required. For the diagnosis of ARND at least three abnormalities of the CNS and a confirmed intrauterine alcohol exposure are necessary. The ARBD is rejected as a separate diagnosis. Conclusion: Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis of FASD that are easily implemented in practice were defined. Regarding treatment and secondary prevention of complications, more research is necessary. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Alcohol related birth defects (ARBD); Alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND); Central nervous system; Guideline; Partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS),alcohol; alcohol consumption; alcohol related birth defect; Article; central nervous system disease; differential diagnosis; face malformation; fetal alcohol syndrome; human; practice guideline; prenatal exposure; systematic review,Springer Verlag
Progress on analytical methods and environmental behavior of emerging per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances,"Lin Y., Ruan T., Jiang G.",2017,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a group of anthropogenic chemicals widely used in manufacture and daily necessities, which are contaminants ubiquitous existed in various environmental matrices and biota. Due to the persistent, bioaccumulative, long-range transport and potential toxic behaviors, production of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid was voluntarily phased out. Perfluorooctanoic acid, its salt and related compounds were also proposed to be included the Stockholm Convention. Restrictions on production and usage of PFAS chemicals have resulted in emergence of novel PFAS compounds through direct manufacturing emissions and indirect transformation pathways, and increasing attention has been focused on these alternatives. In this review, we summarized recent investigations on major groups of emerging PFASs with various molecular structures, and current analytical strategies on the identification of unknown organic fluoride components were overviewed. Four classes of emerging PFASs are covered, including short-chain perfluoroalkyl substances, cyclic perfluoroalkyl acids, perfluoropolyethers and chlorine or hydrogen-substituted polyfluoroalkyl substances. Current knowledge on molecular structures, production and application, environmental behaviors and potential biological effects are summarized, if available. Known PFASs were noticed as a small part of organic fluorinated compounds in the environment. Consequently, new analytical strategies, such as the mass balance analysis and the oxidative conversion methods, were developed for the analysis of unknown fluorinated components. Mass balance analysis of extractable organic fluorine were used to predict the content of unknown organic fluorine in various environmental matrices including sea water, soil, and human blood. Extractable organic fluorine could be exactly quantified after conversion into inorganic fluoride by high-temperature combustion, and known fluorinated components could also be measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The difference in contents between extractable organic fluorine and known fluorinated components was thus considered as components of unknown organic fluorine. The oxidative conversion method was especially superior for the analysis of fluorinated precursors such as fluorotelomer sulfonates, perfluoroalkane sulfonamides and fluorotelomer phosphate diesters, in which these poly-fluoroalkyl substances could be transformed into known perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) by reaction with hydroxyl radicals at basic conditions. The content of polyfluoroalkyl precursors could be determined by comparing the change of PFCAs contents before and after the oxidation assay. Compared with the mass balance analysis method, this oxidative conversion method require quantification of more PFAS terminal products, and it was not applicable for stable perfluorinated compounds. Meanwhile, occurrence of a variety of novel PFAS analogues have brought challenges on PFAS analysis. For instance, varied molecular structures of emerging PFASs result in distinct physical-chemical properties, which further complicate the analytical process including sample pretreatment and chromatographic isolation. Development of additional methods, such as hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) for the analysis of short chain PFASs and orthogonal liquid chromatography for the analysis of zwitterionic, cationic, and anionic fluorinated chemicals, are urgently needed. Statistical tools including mass spectrum deconvolution, peak picking, alignment and feature filtering would be promising for confirmation of novel PFAS molecular structures. Also, environmental transformation of PFAS precursors are still ambiguous. Application of strategies in metabolomics analysis might facilitate studies on degradation mechanism of PFAS chemicals. © 2017, Science Press.

Biological chlorine cycling in the Arctic Coastal Plain,"Zlamal J.E., Raab T.K., Little M., Edwards R.A., Lipson D.A.",2017,Biogeochemistry,"This study explores biological chlorine cycling in coastal Arctic wet tundra soils. While many previous chlorine-cycling studies have focused on contaminated environments, it is now recognized that chlorine can cycle naturally between inorganic and organic forms in soils. However, these pathways have not previously been described for an Arctic ecosystem. We measured soil organic and inorganic Cl pools, characterized soils and plant tissues with chlorine K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (Cl-XANES), measured dechlorination rates in laboratory incubations, and analyzed metagenomes and 16S rRNA genes along a chronosequence of revegetated drained lake basins. Concentrations of soil organic chlorinated compounds (Clorg) were correlated with organic matter content, with a steeper slope in older soils. The concentration and chemical diversity of Clorg increased with soil development, with Clorg in younger soils more closely resembling that of vegetation, and older soils having more complex and variable Cl-XANES signatures. Plant Clorg concentrations were higher than previously published values, and can account for the rapid accumulation of Clorg in soils. The high rates of Clorg input from plants also implies that soil Clorg pools turn over many times during soil development. Metagenomic analyses revealed putative genes for synthesis (haloperoxidases, halogenases) and breakdown (reductive dehalogenases, halo-acid dehalogenases) of Clorg, originating from diverse microbial genomes. Many genome sequences with close similarity to known organohalide respirers (e.g. Dehalococcoides) were identified, and laboratory incubations demonstrated microbial organohalide respiration in vitro. This study provides multiple lines of evidence for a complex and dynamic chlorine cycle in an Arctic tundra ecosystem. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Arctic; Chlorine; Dehalococcoides; Halogen; Organohalide respiration; XANES,arctic environment; chlorine; chronosequence; concentration (composition); genome; microbial activity; organic carbon; organohalogen; respiration; soil carbon; soil chemistry; tundra soil; Arctic Coastal Plain; Dehalococcoides,Springer International Publishing
Survivorship and functional outcomes of patellofemoral arthroplasty: a systematic review,"van der List J.P., Chawla H., Zuiderbaan H.A., Pearle A.D.",2017,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy","Purpose: Historically poor results of survivorship and functional outcomes of patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) have been reported in the setting of isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis. More recently, however, fairly good results of PFA were reported, but the current status of PFA outcomes is unknown. Therefore, a systematic review was performed to assess overall PFA survivorship and functional outcomes. Methods: A search was performed using PubMed, Embase and Cochrane systems, and the registries were searched. Twenty-three cohort studies and one registry reported survivorship using Kaplan–Meier curve, while 51 cohort studies reported functional outcomes of PFA. Results: Twelve studies were level II studies, while 45 studies were level III or IV studies. Heterogeneity was mainly seen in type of prosthesis and year the cohort started. Nine hundred revisions in 9619 PFAs were reported yielding 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-year PFA survivorships of 91.7, 83.3, 74.9 and 66.6 %, respectively, and an annual revision rate of 2.18. Functional outcomes were reported in 2587 PFAs with an overall score of 82.2 % of the maximum score. KSS and Knee Function Score were 87.5 and 81.6 %, respectively. Conclusion: This systematic review showed that fairly good results of PFA survivorship and functional outcomes were reported at short- and midterm follow-up in the setting of isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis. Heterogeneity existed mainly in prosthesis design and year the cohort started. Clinical relevance: These results provide a clear overview of the current status of PFA in the setting of isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis.

Exposure to PFOA and PFOS and fetal growth: a critical merging of toxicological and epidemiological data,"Negri E., Metruccio F., Guercio V., Tosti L., Benfenati E., Bonzi R., La Vecchia C., Moretto A.",2017,Critical Reviews in Toxicology,"Toxicological and epidemiological evidence on the association between perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and birth/fetal weight was assessed. An extensive search for toxicological information in rats and mice, and a systematic search for epidemiological evidence were conducted. The linear regression coefficient (LRC) of birth weight (BrthW) on PFOA/PFOS was considered, and separate random effects meta-analyses for untransformed (i.e. not mathematically transformed) and log-transformed values were performed. Toxicological evidence: PFOA: 12 studies (21 datasets) in mice showed statistically significant lower birth/fetal weights from 5 mg/kg body weight per day. PFOS: most of the 13 studies (19 datasets) showed lower birth/fetal weights following in utero exposure. Epidemiological evidence: Sixteen articles were considered. The pooled LRC for a 1 ng/mL increase in untransformed PFOA (12 studies) in maternal plasma/serum was −12.8 g (95% CI −23.2; 2.4), and −27.1 g (95% CI −50.6; −3.6) for an increase of 1 loge ng/mL PFOA (nine studies). The pooled LRC for untransformed PFOS (eight studies) was −0.92 g (95%CI −3.4; 1.6), and for an increase of 1 loge ng/mL was −46.1(95% CI −80.3; −11.9). No consistent pattern emerged for study location or timing of blood sampling. Conclusions: Epidemiological and toxicological evidence suggests that PFOA and PFOS elicit a decrease in BrthW both in humans and rodents. However, the effective animal extrapolated serum concentrations are 102–103 times higher than those in humans. Thus, there is no quantitative toxicological evidence to support the epidemiological association, thus reducing the biological plausibility of a causal relationship. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Birth weight; epidemiology; evidence; fetal growth; integration; meta-analysis; perfluoroalkyls; PFOA; PFOS; reproduction; systematic review; toxicology,perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; birth weight; blood level; blood sampling; epidemiological data; fetus; fetus growth; fetus weight; human; linear regression analysis; maternal blood; maternal plasma; medical literature; nonhuman; prenatal exposure; Review; statistical significance; systematic review; animal; drug effects; environmental exposure; epidemiological monitoring; female; fetus development; maternal exposure; mouse; rat; toxicity testing; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Birth Weight; Caprylates; Environmental Exposure; Epidemiological Monitoring; Female; Fetal Development; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Mice; Rats; Toxicity Tests,Taylor and Francis Ltd
Exposure to perfluorinated alkyl substances and health outcomes in children: A systematic review of the epidemiologic literature,"Rappazzo K.M., Coffman E., Hines E.P.",2017,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals used to make products stain and stick resistant, have been linked to health effects in adults and adverse birth outcomes. A growing body of literature also addresses health effects in children exposed to PFAS. This review summarizes the epidemiologic evidence for relationships between prenatal and/or childhood exposure to PFAS and health outcomes in children as well as to provide a risk of bias analysis of the literature. A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed for studies on PFAS and child health outcomes. We identified 64 studies for inclusion and performed risk of bias analysis on those studies. We determined that risk of bias across studies was low to moderate. Six categories of health outcomes emerged. These were: immunity/infection/asthma, cardio-metabolic, neurodevelopmental/attention, thyroid, renal, and puberty onset. While there are a limited number of studies for any one particular health outcome, there is evidence for positive associations between PFAS and dyslipidemia, immunity (including vaccine response and asthma), renal function, and age at menarche. One finding of note is that while PFASs are mixtures of multiple compounds few studies examine them as such, therefore the role of these compounds as complex mixtures remains largely unknown. © 2017 by the authors.

Importance of metabolomics analyses of maternal parameters and their influence on fetal growth,"Liu J., Liu G., Li Z.",2017,Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine,"Metabolomics is the scientific study of chemical processes involving metabolites. Specifically, metabolomics is the systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specifically conveys cell processes. Fetal growth aberrations, including fetal growth restriction and macrosomia, convey the highest risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity, as well as increasing the chance of developing chronic disease in later life. We searched the electronic database PubMed for preclinical as well as clinical controlled studies pertaining to metabolomics analyses of maternal parameters and their influence on fetal growth. It was observed clearly that metabolic profiling/metabolomics approaches in maternal urine samples provide information on early-life exposure and are potentially linked to child health outcomes, in addition to identifying new biomarkers of exposure. This review article is aimed to discuss intra- and inter-individual variations in maternal urine profiles during pregnancy, fetal growth outcomes and environmental sources of metabolic variations. The review concludes that metabolic profiling of mother is a useful tool for the evaluation of influences on the growth of the fetus. © 2017, Spandidos Publications.

Early life exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs): A critical review,"Winkens K., Vestergren R., Berger U., Cousins I.T.",2017,Emerging Contaminants,"Due to the dynamic developmental processes during pregnancy, infancy, childhood and adolescence, exposure to PFASs is hypothesized to have the most pronounced negative effects during this period. In this review we critically evaluate the current state of the science regarding human early life exposure processes (until 18 years of age) to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Efficient placental transfer of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) results in relatively high prenatal exposure compared with many neutral organic contaminants. The few biomonitoring studies that specifically target infants, toddlers and other children suggest relatively high serum concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in early life with peak concentrations occurring sometime before the child reaches 20 months. This peak in serum concentrations is most likely explained by exposure via breastfeeding, ingestion of house dust and/or specific contact events with consumer products leading to high body weight normalized estimated daily intakes (EDIs). Although children have higher EDIs of PFASs than adults, these are not always reflected by higher serum levels of PFASs in children in cross-sectional biomonitoring studies due to the confounding effect of age and birth cohort, and different exposure histories due to production changes. Longitudinal exposure studies measuring internal and external exposure (for multiple pathways and PFASs) at several time points during early life are strongly encouraged to understand temporal changes in exposure of individual children. A better quantitative understanding of early life exposure processes would help to improve the validity of epidemiological studies and allow informed decisions regarding setting of regulatory thresholds and appropriate mitigation actions. © 2017 The Authors",,,KeAi Communications Co.
"Systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence of, and risk factors for, pelvic floor disorders in community-dwelling women in low and middle-income countries: A protocol study","Islam R.M., Oldroyd J., Karim M.N., Hossain S.M., Md Emdadul Hoque D., Romero L., Fisher J.",2017,BMJ Open,"Introduction: Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) including urinary incontinence, faecal incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse are common debilitating conditions among women in high-income countries. However, PFDs in women in low/middle-income countries (LMICs) have not been studied extensively. We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to determine the prevalence of, and/or risk factors for, PFDs in women in LMIC. Methods and analysis: We will search electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Maternity &amp; Infant Care and Google Scholar for eligible studies. Inclusion criteria will be observational studies of healthy women, which have collected data using validated or non-validated tools, are published in English and were conducted in community women in LMICs, defined by the World Bank. A standardised data extraction form will be developed and piloted, based on the template of the Cochrane good practice data extraction form. All included studies will be assessed based on a risk-of-bias tool specifically developed for prevalence studies. Pooled prevalence estimates of PFDs will be generated using RevMan V.5.2.1 software. Forest plots will be generated to display the overall random-effects pooled estimates with CIs. A metaregression will be conducted to identify sources of between-study heterogeneity in the pooled prevalence estimates. We will quantify heterogeneity using the I2 measure and its CI. We will use funnel plots to detect potential reporting biases and small-study effects. We will also conduct a sensitivity analysis to verify the robustness of the study conclusions, assessing the impact of methodological quality, study design, sample size and the effect of missing data. Ethics and dissemination: Our review is entirely based on published data. Thus, an ethics committee approval or written informed consent will not be required for this study as primary data will not be collected. The results will be disseminated by publication of the manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal and/or will be presented at relevant conferences. © 2017 Article author(s).",epidemiology; gynaecology; urogynaecology,Article; Cinahl; Embase; human; Medline; meta analysis; middle income country; observational study; pelvic floor disorder; prevalence; PsycINFO; risk factor; systematic review; developing country; female; multivariate analysis; pelvic floor disorder; prevalence; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Developing Countries; Female; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Pelvic Floor Disorders; Prevalence; Risk Factors,BMJ Publishing Group
Perioperative Management of Older Women in Urogynecologic Surgery,"Yuan A.S., Siggins C.A., Erekson E.",2017,Current Geriatrics Reports,"Purpose of Review: Preoperative measurements of frailty and mobility predict surgical outcomes in older patients better than measurements of medical comorbidities or American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status alone. The purpose of this review is to summarize updated evidence for optimal preoperative assessment, perioperative management, and postoperative care for elective gynecologic surgery in older women. Recent Findings: Two joint best-practice guideline statements from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) and the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) focus on preoperative (2012) and perioperative care (2016) of the geriatric patient. Summary: Preoperative identification of frailty, cognitive impairment, and functional disability in older women may be an important way to improve outcomes. Preoperative identification has the potential to allow surgeons to better counsel patients about unique postoperative risks, tailor the aggressiveness of the surgical approach, and facilitate shared decision-making. Finally, preoperative identification can help identify patients who need extra support at hospital discharge with transitions of care. Future research is necessary to assess the impact of preoperative geriatric screening for frailty, cognitive impairment, and mobility disorders with treatment success and postoperative outcomes in older women undergoing surgical correction of pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) and other elective gynecologic procedures. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Frailty; Geriatric surgery; Pelvic organ prolapse; Postoperative delirium; Preoperative medical risk assessment,albumin; creatinine; abdominal discomfort; alcohol abuse; analgesia; bloating; cardiovascular risk; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chronic obstructive lung disease; decision making; depression; diet restriction; female; functional assessment; geriatric assessment; geriatric care; Geriatric Depression Scale; human; meta analysis (topic); Mini Cog score; Mini Mental State Examination; nutritional status; Patient Health Questionnaire; perioperative period; postoperative delirium; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; Saint Louis University Mental Status examination; substance abuse; systematic review (topic); urea nitrogen blood level; urologic surgery,Springer New York LLC
Quantitation of levodopa and carbidopa in rat plasma by LC–MS/MS: The key role of ion-pairing reversed-phase chromatography,"Chi J., Ling Y., Jenkins R., Li F.",2017,Journal of Chromatography B: Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical and Life Sciences,"A simple and selective bioanalytical method was developed for simultaneous determination of levodopa and carbidopa in rat plasma by LC–MS/MS. Levodopa and carbidopa are small polar molecules, posing challenges in the development of selective and efficient chromatography conditions. Perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPA), a volatile ion-pairing agent, was utilized to enhance chromatographic characteristics of both compounds in the reversed-phase mechanism. The ion-pairing chromatography played an essential role in mitigating matrix effects and achieving adequate separation between interfering background peaks and those of the analytes of interest, especially for levodopa. A 96-well based, automated liquid-liquid extraction, via the use Hamilton NIMBUS liquid handlers, was developed. Butyl alcohol, when mixed with ethyl acetate, greatly increased the recovery of both levodopa and carbidopa. The addition of PFPA further enhanced recovery for both analytes. Sodium metabisulfite, an antioxidant, was used to stabilize levodopa and carbidopa in rat plasma. The method was validated in the ranges of 50–10,000 ng/mL and 25–5000 ng/mL for levodopa and carbidopa, respectively, using levodopa-d3 and carbidopa-d3 as internal standards. The validated method was successfully applied to analyze rat plasma samples from in-life studies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Automated liquid-liquid extraction (LLE); Ion-pairing agent reversed-phase chromatography; Levodopa and carbidopa; Matrix stability; Perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPA),"Antioxidants; Body fluids; Chromatography; Enhanced recovery; Extraction; Ion chromatography; Ionic liquids; Ions; Liquid chromatography; Liquids; Rats; Solvent extraction; Carbidopa; Liquid-liquid extraction; Matrix stability; Perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPA); Reversed phase chromatography; Drug products; acetic acid ethyl ester; butanol; carbidopa; levodopa; perfluoropentanoic acid; unclassified drug; valeric acid; carbidopa; dopamine receptor stimulating agent; levodopa; valeric acid derivative; accuracy; animal experiment; Article; calibration; drug blood level; drug determination; ion pair chromatography; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liquid liquid extraction; nonhuman; priority journal; quality control; rat; animal; blood; chemistry; limit of detection; procedures; reversed phase liquid chromatography; tandem mass spectrometry; validation study; Animals; Carbidopa; Chromatography, Reverse-Phase; Dopamine Agents; Levodopa; Limit of Detection; Liquid-Liquid Extraction; Pentanoic Acids; Rats; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Elsevier B.V.

Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas associated with high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas: a systematic review,"Chen F., Gaitskell K., Garcia M.J., Albukhari A., Tsaltas J., Ahmed A.A.",2017,BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,"Background: Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) have been documented in high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs). However, the rate of association between STICs and HGSOCs and, therefore, the fraction of HGSOCs that are likely to have originated from the fallopian tube (FT), has remained unclear. Objective: To appraise the literature describing the association between STICs and established HGSOCs. Search strategy: Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Selection criteria: Studies were included if they evaluated the frequency of STICs in HGSOCs, and were published in an English peer-reviewed journal. Data collection and analysis: Appropriate studies were evaluated for their compliance with the ‘Strengthening and Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)’ criteria. Main results: Ten articles met the study selection criteria. The reported coexistence between STICs and HGSOCs ranged from 11% to 61% (mean: 31%, 95% CI: 17–46%). STICs were rarely found in other gynaecological cancers. Small sample size, lack of objective criteria to identify STICs and the retrospective nature of the studies contributed to the variability in reporting the rate of the association. Conclusions: STICs were identified commonly in the FTs of women with HGSOC. Finding the true rate of association between STICs and HGSOCs will require further investigations. While there is evidence that a fraction of HGSOCs arise from the FTs, an accurate estimate of that fraction remains to be determined. The lack of an accurate estimate of the association makes it difficult to evaluate the potential magnitude of reduction of HGSOCs following prophylactic salpingectomy.

Is body mass index associated with patellofemoral pain and patellofemoral osteoarthritis? A systematic review and meta-regression and analysis,"Hart H.F., Barton C.J., Khan K.M., Riel H., Crossley K.M.",2017,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Background Patellofemoral pain (PFP) occurs frequently, and may be related to patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). Obesity is associated with increased risk of knee OA. This systematic review involves a meta-regression and analysis to determine the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and PFP and PFOA, and to determine the link between BMI and interventional outcomes. Methods We searched seven electronic databases and reference lists of relevant papers and systematic reviews, for cross-sectional, prospective, human-based observational and interventional studies reporting BMI in individuals with PFP or PFOA compared to healthy controls. Two independent reviewers appraised methodological quality (epidemiological appraisal instrument). Where possible, data from prospective studies were pooled to conduct meta-regression and case-control, and intervention studies to conduct meta-analysis using the following categories: adolescents with PFP, adults with PFP and PFOA. Results 52 studies were included. We found greater BMI in adults with PFP (standardised mean difference: 0.24, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.36) and PFOA (0.73, 0.46 to 0.99) compared to healthy controls, but not in adolescents with PFP (-0.19,-0.56 to 0.18). We also observed statistical trends (p<0.10) towards higher BMI being a predictor for development of PFP in adults (0.34,-0.04 to 0.71). No significant link between BMI and intervention outcomes in adults with PFP was identified. Conclusions Higher BMI is present in PFP and PFOA, but not in adolescents with PFP.

Enzymatic Halogenation and Dehalogenation Reactions: Pervasive and Mechanistically Diverse,"Agarwal V., Miles Z.D., Winter J.M., Eustáquio A.S., El Gamal A.A., Moore B.S.",2017,Chemical Reviews,"Naturally produced halogenated compounds are ubiquitous across all domains of life where they perform a multitude of biological functions and adopt a diversity of chemical structures. Accordingly, a diverse collection of enzyme catalysts to install and remove halogens from organic scaffolds has evolved in nature. Accounting for the different chemical properties of the four halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) and the diversity and chemical reactivity of their organic substrates, enzymes performing biosynthetic and degradative halogenation chemistry utilize numerous mechanistic strategies involving oxidation, reduction, and substitution. Biosynthetic halogenation reactions range from simple aromatic substitutions to stereoselective C-H functionalizations on remote carbon centers and can initiate the formation of simple to complex ring structures. Dehalogenating enzymes, on the other hand, are best known for removing halogen atoms from man-made organohalogens, yet also function naturally, albeit rarely, in metabolic pathways. This review details the scope and mechanism of nature's halogenation and dehalogenation enzymatic strategies, highlights gaps in our understanding, and posits where new advances in the field might arise in the near future. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Biosynthesis; Chemical properties; Dehalogenation; Enzymes; Scaffolds; Biological functions; Enzymatic halogenation; Enzyme catalysts; Functionalizations; Halogenated compounds; Metabolic pathways; Organic scaffolds; Organic substrate; Halogenation; enzyme; halogen; riboflavin derivative; vanadium; Enzymes; Flavins; Halogens; Vanadium,American Chemical Society

The role of the complement system in cancer,Afshar-Kharghan V.,2017,Journal of Clinical Investigation,"In addition to being a component of innate immunity and an ancient defense mechanism against invading pathogens, complement activation also participates in the adaptive immune response, inflammation, hemostasis, embryogenesis, and organ repair and development. Activation of the complement system via classical, lectin, or alternative pathways generates anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) and membrane attack complex (C5b-9) and opsonizes targeted cells. Complement activation end products and their receptors mediate cell-cell interactions that regulate several biological functions in the extravascular tissue. Signaling of anaphylatoxin receptors or assembly of membrane attack complex promotes cell dedifferentiation, proliferation, and migration in addition to reducing apoptosis. As a result, complement activation in the tumor microenvironment enhances tumor growth and increases metastasis.

Univariate predictors of maternal concentrations of environmental chemicals: The MIREC study,"Lewin A., Arbuckle T.E., Fisher M., Liang C.L., Marro L., Davis K., Abdelouahab N., Fraser W.D.",2017,International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health,"Background The developing fetus and pregnant woman can be exposed to a variety of environmental chemicals that may adversely affect their health. Moreover, environmental exposure and risk disparities are associated with different social determinants, including socioeconomic status (SES) and demographic indicators. Our aim was to investigate whether and how maternal concentrations of a large panel of persistent and non-persistent environmental chemicals vary according to sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics in a large pregnancy and birth cohort. Methods Data were analyzed from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, a cohort of pregnant women (N = 2001) recruited over four years (2008–2011) in 10 cities across Canada. In all, 1890 urine and 1938 blood samples from the first trimester (1st and 3rd trimester for metals) were analysed and six sociodemographic and lifestyle indicators were assessed: maternal age, household income, parity, smoking status, country of birth and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Results We found these indicators to be significantly associated with many of the chemicals measured in maternal blood and urine. Women born outside Canada had significantly higher concentrations of di-2-ethylhexyl and diethyl phthalate metabolites, higher levels of all metals except cadmium (Cd), as well as higher levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and legacy organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Nulliparity was associated with higher concentrations of dialkyl phosphates (DAPs), arsenic, dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and many of the persistent organic pollutants. Smokers had higher levels of bisphenol A, Cd and perfluorohexane sulfonate, while those women who had never smoked had higher levels of triclosan, DMAA, manganese and some OCPs. Conclusion Our results demonstrated that inequitable distribution of exposure to chemicals among populations within a country can occur. Sociodemographic and lifestyle factors are an important component of a thorough risk assessment as they can impact the degree of exposure and may modify the individual's susceptibility to potential health effects due to differences in lifestyle, cultural diets, and aging. © 2017 The Authors",Biomonitoring; Blood; Chemicals; Pregnancy; Smoking; Sociodemographic factors; Urine,"arsenic; heavy metal; organic compound; organoarsenic derivative; pollutant; adult; blood; body mass; Canada; environmental monitoring; female; human; income; lifestyle; maternal age; maternal exposure; parity; pollutant; pregnancy; smoking; urine; Adult; Arsenic; Arsenicals; Body Mass Index; Canada; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Income; Life Style; Maternal Age; Maternal Exposure; Metals, Heavy; Organic Chemicals; Parity; Pregnancy; Smoking",Elsevier GmbH
Perfluorinated alkylated substances and brominated flame retardants in serum of the Czech adult population,"Sochorová L., Hanzlíková L., Černá M., Drgáčová A., Fialová A., Švarcová A., Gramblička T., Pulkrabová J.",2017,International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health,"Persistent organic pollutants, such as perfluorinated alkylated substances (PFASs) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are widespread in the environment and most of them are bioaccumulated in wildlife and humans. The present study is the first investigation to reveal the PFAS and BFR levels of serum samples in the adult population of the Czech Republic. Altogether, 300 serum samples from blood donors in four cities were examined. In all samples 19 PFASs and 33 BFRs, including some of their metabolites, were targeted. The analyses were performed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry or gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (according to the type of analyte). PFASs, with the carbon chain length C6 and higher, dominated in all samples. Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS; median: 2.43 ng/mL), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; median: 0.756 ng/mL), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA; median: 0.145 ng/mL) and perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS; median: 0.184 ng/mL) were detected in 100% of samples. Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA; median: 0.325 ng/mL) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA; median: 0.058 ng/mL) in 99.7% and 96.0% of samples, respectively. We observed statistically significant associations (p < 0.05) between selected PFAS concentrations and the locality, gender, age of donors and education level. None of the BFRs was detected above the LOQ in more than 9% of the samples. The most frequently detected representatives of this group were congeners of polybrominated diphenyl ethers, namely BDE-47 (in 8.7%; range: 0.496–5.44 ng/g lipid weight (l.w.)), BDE-99 (in 6.0%; range: 0.706–9.46 ng/g l.w.), BDE-153 (in 7.3%; range: 0.736–6.44 ng/g l.w.) and BDE-209 (in 7.0%; range: 13.7–2693 ng/g l.w.). © 2016 Elsevier GmbH",Brominated flame retardants; Czech Republic; Human biomonitoring; Perfluorinated alkylated substances; Persistent organic pollutants,alkanesulfonic acid; carboxylic acid; diphenyl ether derivative; flame retardant; fluorocarbon; pollutant; polybrominated biphenyl; adolescent; adult; aged; blood; city; Czech Republic; environmental monitoring; female; human; male; middle aged; pollutant; urban population; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Carboxylic Acids; Cities; Czech Republic; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Flame Retardants; Fluorocarbons; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polybrominated Biphenyls; Urban Population; Young Adult,Elsevier GmbH
Teflon granulomas mimicking cerebellopontine angle tumors following microvascular decompression,"Deep N.L., Graffeo C.S., Copeland W.R., III, Link M.J., Atkinson J.L., Neff B.A., Raghunathan A., Carlson M.L.",2017,Laryngoscope,"Objectives/Hypothesis: To report two patients with a history of microvascular decompression (MVD) for hemifacial spasm who presented with Teflon granulomas (TG) mimicking cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumors and to perform a systematic review of the English-language literature. Study Design: Case series at a single tertiary academic referral center and systematic review. Methods: Retrospective chart review with analysis of clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings. Systematic review using PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases. Results: Two patients with large skull base TGs mimicking CPA tumors clinically and radiographically were managed at the authors' institution. The first presented 4 years after MVD with asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss, multiple progressive cranial neuropathies, and brainstem edema due to a growing TG. Reoperation with resection of the granuloma confirmed a foreign-body reaction consisting of multinucleated giant cells containing intracytoplasmic Teflon particles. The second patient presented 11 years after MVD with asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss and recurrent hemifacial spasm. No growth was noted over 2 years, and the patient has been managed expectantly. Only one prior case of TG after MVD for hemifacial spasm has been reported in the English literature. Conclusions: TG is a rare complication of MVD for hemifacial spasm. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients presenting with a new-onset enhancing mass of the CPA after MVD, even when performed decades earlier. A thorough clinical and surgical history is critical toward establishing an accurate diagnosis to guide management and prevent unnecessary morbidity. Surgical intervention is not required unless progressive neurologic complications ensue.

New Insights into Perfluorinated Sulfonic-Acid Ionomers,"Kusoglu A., Weber A.Z.",2017,Chemical Reviews,"In this comprehensive review, recent progress and developments on perfluorinated sulfonic-acid (PFSA) membranes have been summarized on many key topics. Although quite well investigated for decades, PFSA ionomers’ complex behavior, along with their key role in many emerging technologies, have presented significant scientific challenges but also helped create a unique cross-disciplinary research field to overcome such challenges. Research and progress on PFSAs, especially when considered with their applications, are at the forefront of bridging electrochemistry and polymer (physics), which have also opened up development of state-of-the-art in situ characterization techniques as well as multiphysics computation models. Topics reviewed stem from correlating the various physical (e.g., mechanical) and transport properties with morphology and structure across time and length scales. In addition, topics of recent interest such as structure/transport correlations and modeling, composite PFSA membranes, degradation phenomena, and PFSA thin films are presented. Throughout, the impact of PFSA chemistry and side-chain is also discussed to present a broader perspective. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Composite films; Composite membranes; Cross-disciplinary research; Emerging technologies; In-situ characterization techniques; Morphology and structures; Multi-physics computation; Perfluorinated sulfonic acid; Recent progress; State of the art; Ionomers,American Chemical Society
Rapid determination of small molecule pollutants using metal-organic frameworks as adsorbent and matrix of MALDI-TOF-MS,"Wang S., Niu H., Zeng T., Zhang X., Cao D., Cai Y.",2017,Microporous and Mesoporous Materials,"Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) has been commonly used for the determination of macromolecules owing to the high sensitivity and convenience. However, the direct analysis of small molecule with MALDI-TOF-MS remains a challenge due to the matrix interference in the low mass region. In this paper, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs: MOF-5, MOF-235, Cu-btc MOFs and Uio-66(Zr)-2OH) were successfully used as both adsorbent and significant matrix of MALDI-TOF-MS method for the analysis of small molecule pollutants. Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) were chosen as model analytes to investigate the matrix function of MOFs with LDI measurement in positive and negative reflection mode, respectively. As a result, MOFs exhibit high laser desorption/ionization efficiency and function well in both positive-ion and negative-ion modes. Compared to the MS spectra with conventional matrices, MS spectra obtained on MOFs matrix are only featured by deprotonated molecule ion peaks without background interference. Furthermore, MOFs, with large surface area and π-π stacking structure, can also enrich trace amounts of small molecule pollutants from solution efficiently and quickly. According to these, we developed a simple method in which MOFs-solid-phase extraction (SPE) enrichment was combined with MALDI-TOF-MS to realize the direct analysis of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) in real water samples. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Enrichment; MALDI-TOF-MS; Matrix; Metal-organic framework; PFOS,Blast enrichment; Crystalline materials; Desorption; Inductively coupled plasma; Ions; Java programming language; Mass spectrometry; Matrix algebra; Metal analysis; Molecules; Negative ions; Organic polymers; Organometallics; Phase separation; Pollution; Positive ions; Laser desorption/ionization; MALDI TOF MS; Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry; Metal organic framework; Perfluorinated compound (PFCs); Perfluorooctane sulfonates; PFOS; Solid-phase extraction; Organic pollutants,Elsevier B.V.
Increased blood levels of persistent organic pollutants (POP) in obese individuals after weight loss—A review,"Jansen A., Lyche J.L., Polder A., Aaseth J., Skaug M.A.",2017,Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health - Part B: Critical Reviews,"Lipophilic persistent organic pollutants (POP) are stored in adipose tissue. Following rapid weight loss such as when induced by bariatric surgery, an increased release of potential harmful lipophilic compounds into the blood circulation may occur. Weight reduction is recommended for overweight and obese individuals in order to decrease risk of weight-related health problems. However, in cases of significant weight reduction POP become mobilized chemicals and consequently may adversely affect health, including endocrine disruption. The objective of the present investigation was to estimate quantitatively the level of mobilization of POP following weight loss over time. According to literature search criteria, 17 studies were identified with 2061 participants. Data from 5 of the studies with 270 participants were used to assess the change in blood levels of POP in percent per kilogram weight loss. Weight loss in the included studies varied from 4.4 to 64.8 kg. In all studies, the majority of POP concentrations in blood were found to rise following weight reduction. Blood concentrations following weight reduction were elevated by 2–4% per kilogram weight loss for most POP examined. The increased POP levels were still elevated 12 mo after intervention. Most research in this field, including animal studies, is carried out on a single compound or group of selected compounds, not taking the “cocktail effect” into consideration. This does not reflect the true range of POP to which humans are actually exposed. Few chronic investigations have been published and, in particular, few studies were available that compared the increase in POP concentrations with clinical consequences as individuals lost weight. These limitations call for caution in interpreting results. The benefits of losing weight still far outweigh the potential adverse health risks. However, further studies are recommended to determine the clinical significance of increased blood levels of POPs following rapid and excessive weight loss, particularly for women attending weight reduction treatment before pregnancy. © 2016, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © Aina Jansen, Jan L.

Potential Effectiveness of Point-of-Use Filtration to Address Risks to Drinking Water in the United States,"Brown K.W., Gessesse B., Butler L.J., MacIntosh D.L.",2017,Environmental Health Insights,"Numerous contemporary incidents demonstrate that conventional control strategies for municipal tap water have limited ability to mitigate exposures to chemicals whose sources are within distribution systems, such as lead, and chemicals that are not removed by standard treatment technologies, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)/perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). In these situations, point-of-use (POU) controls may be effective in mitigating exposures and managing health risks of chemicals in drinking water, but their potential utility has not been extensively examined. As an initial effort to fill this information gap, we conducted a critical review and analysis of the existing literature and data on the effectiveness of POU drinking water treatment technologies for reducing chemical contaminants commonly found in tap water in the United States. We found that many types of water treatment devices available to consumers in the United States have undergone laboratory testing and often certification for removal of chemical contaminants in tap water, but in most cases their efficacy in actual use has yet to be well characterized. In addition, the few studies of POU devices while “in use” focus on traditional contaminants regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, but do not generally consider nontraditional contaminants of concern, such as certain novel human carcinogens, industrial chemicals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and flame retardants. Nevertheless, the limited information available at present suggests that POU devices can be highly effective when used prophylactically and when deployed in response to contamination incidents. Based on these findings, we identify future areas of research for assessing the ability of POU filters to reduce health-related chemical contaminants distributed through public water systems and private wells. © The Author(s) 2017.",drinking water treatment; faucet-mount filter; filtration; Flint; NSF; Point-of-use (POU) filter,,SAGE Publications Inc.
Photocatalytic degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate in water: A critical review,"Wang S., Yang Q., Chen F., Sun J., Luo K., Yao F., Wang X., Wang D., Li X., Zeng G.",2017,Chemical Engineering Journal,"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are persistent organic pollutants in the environment and have serious health risks, including endocrine disrupting properties, immunotoxicity and developmental effects etc. The photochemical degradation has been proven to be a low-cost, efficient and sustainable technology for the removal of PFOX (X = A or S) in water. At present, most of the investigations have been conducted in ultrapure water and at concentrations much higher comparing to those detected in the real wastewaters. Furthermore, there are few studies about the toxicity of treated water. In this paper, the state of knowledge on the photocatalytic degradation of PFOX, including photo-oxidative and photo-reductive degradation, is reviewed comprehensively. Compared with photo-oxidation, photo-reduction appears to be more suitable for the PFOX removal since it is more favorable for the defluorination of PFOX and further complete mineralization. The effects of key parameters on the photocatalytic degradation and defluorination process of PFOX are commendably accessed, such as light wavelength, photocatalyst concentration, initial PFOX concentration, pH, reaction atmosphere, temperature, and coexisting organic or inorganic matters. The mechanisms of PFOX photodegradation process are also elucidated in detail. This paper will help to deeply understand PFOX decomposition process and put forward better perspectives in the future for researchers who work in this field. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Defluorination; Mechanisms; Perfluorooctane sulfonate; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Photodegradation,Endocrine disrupters; Health risks; Mechanisms; Organic pollutants; Photodegradation; Water pollution; Defluorination; Endocrine disrupting properties; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Photo catalytic degradation; Photocatalyst concentration; Photochemical degradation; Water treatment,Elsevier B.V.
Exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances and thyroid function in pregnant women and children: A systematic review of epidemiologic studies,"Ballesteros V., Costa O., Iñiguez C., Fletcher T., Ballester F., Lopez-Espinosa M.-J.",2017,Environment International,"Introduction Thyroid hormones (THs) are especially important for brain maturation and development during the fetal period and childhood. Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and thyroid outcomes during the early stages of life. We aimed to review this evidence. Methods We conducted a systematic review in compliance with the PRISMA Statement (search conducted in PubMed and Embase, as well as in the citations of the selected articles). We chose studies if they dealt with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin (T4), or thyroid dysfunctions, and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measured in the blood of pregnant women and/or children up to 19 years old. Results We included in this review three cross-sectional, one case-control, and six cohort studies (publication: 2011–2015), focusing on prenatal life (n = 7), childhood (n = 2) or both periods (n = 1). We observed a high degree of heterogeneity across studies in terms of sampling time (different gestational weeks, at birth, or childhood), outcomes, adjustment for potential confounders, and statistical approach. We found some evidence of a positive association between PFHxS and PFOS exposure and TSH levels measured in maternal blood, and PFNA and TSH levels measured in the blood of boys aged ≥ 11 years. Conclusion Although there is a small number of studies with comparable data, we found some consistency of a positive association between maternal or teenage male exposure to some PFAS and TSH levels based on the current literature. However, further studies are required to confirm these possible relationships. © 2016 The Authors",Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS); Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA); Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS); Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA); Prenatal and infant exposure; Thyroid,Hormones; Sampling; Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS); Perfluorononanoic acids; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Prenatal and infant exposure; Thyroid; Blood; liothyronine; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; thyrotropin; thyroxine; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perflexane; blood; child health; cohort analysis; epidemiology; pollution exposure; pregnancy; sulfonate; womens health; birth; case control study; childhood; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; data base; epidemiological data; exposure; human; maternal blood; pregnant woman; prenatal period; Review; systematic review; thyroid disease; thyroid function; thyroid hormone blood level; adolescent; child; drug effects; environmental exposure; female; male; pollutant; pregnancy; thyroid gland; toxicity; Adolescent; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Child; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Male; Pregnancy; Thyroid Gland,Elsevier Ltd
Electrochemical Advanced Oxidation Processes (EAOP) to degrade per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs),"Fang C., Megharaj M., Naidu R.",2017,Journal of Advanced Oxidation Technologies,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been recently listed as emerging contaminants (ECs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) due to their human and environmental health concerns. In the last 10 years, their detection and remediation have progressed significantly. Herein, we critically review recent developments in electrochemical advanced oxidation process (EAOP) towards their remediation. Particular attentions are paid to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which present the main concerns of PFASs at this time. Due to the persistence of those PFASs, other remediation approaches may experience difficulty in degrading them, whilst EAOP has demonstrated success. The fundamentals of EAOP are highlighted and the scale-up application is discussed regarding the future research directions. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.",degradation; electrochemical advanced oxidisation process (EAOP); emerging contaminants; per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs); persistent organic pollutants,Degradation; Electrochemical advanced oxidation process; electrochemical advanced oxidisation process (EAOP); Emerging contaminant; Environmental health concern; Future research directions; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Persistent organic pollutants; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Organic pollutants,Walter de Gruyter GmbH
Fluoroalkyl azides for rapid radiolabeling and (Re)investigation of their potential towards: In vivo click chemistry,"Denk C., Wilkovitsch M., Skrinjar P., Svatunek D., Mairinger S., Kuntner C., Filip T., Fröhlich J., Wanek T., Mikula H.",2017,Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry,"In recent years, radiofluorinated alkyl azides have been reported for click radiolabeling and pretargeted PET imaging, but only little is known about the biodistribution and metabolism of these compounds.

Proximal femoral nail antirotation versus hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of senile intertrochanteric fractures: Case report,"Luo X., He S., Zeng D., Lin L., Li Q.",2017,International Journal of Surgery Case Reports,"Background Primary hemiarthroplasty was recommended by some surgeons as the preferred choice in treating unstable senile intertrochanteric fractures with osteoporosis. However, many studies reported that proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) currently was as an optimal implant for the treatment of different type of intertrochanteric fractures. Which method is better for treating senile intertrochanteric fractures remains controversial due to the insufficient clinical evidences. Methods We reviewed all consecutive senile intertrochanteric fractures treated with PFNA or cemented hemiarthroplasty at our institution between July 2010 and March 2015. The primary outcome measures were postoperative complications, reoperation rate and hip function. The secondary outcome measures were intraoperative blood loss, transfusion rate, surgical time, postoperative hemoglobin, hospital stay and 1- year mortality. Results Seventy-one patients in PFNA group and 52 patients in hemiarthroplasty group were included for analysis. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding to the orthopaedic complications, reoperation rate, surgical time and Harris Hip Score at 1 year follow-up. Significant differences were found between PFNA and hemiarthroplasty group in comparison of intraoperative blood loss (P < 0.001), transfusion rate, medical complications (P = 0.037) and hospital stay (P = 0.001). Patients treated with hemiarthroplasty had a trend of higher postoperative 1- year mortality compared to those underwent PFNA but this was statistically not significant (P = 0.134). Conclusions These findings indicate that PFNA has obvious advantages over hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of senile intertrochanteric fractures. Hemiarthroplasty in treating these fractures is associated with greater surgical trauma and higher incidence of postoperative medical complications. © 2017",Case report; Hemiarthroplasty; Intertrochanteric fracture,hemoglobin; aged; Article; blood transfusion; cause of death; debridement; female; femur intertrochanteric fracture; follow up; fracture healing; fracture nonunion; fracture of greater trochanter; Harris hip score; heart disease; hemiarthroplasty; hemoglobin blood level; human; immobility; length of stay; lung infection; major clinical study; male; mortality; operative blood loss; orthopedic surgery; outcome assessment; pain severity; pneumonia; postoperative period; priority journal; prosthesis dislocation; prosthesis loosening; proximal femoral nail antirotation; reoperation; uremia; very elderly; weight bearing; wound dressing; wound infection,Elsevier Ltd
Environmental exposures and pediatric kidney function and disease: A systematic review,"Zheng L.Y., Sanders A.P., Saland J.M., Wright R.O., Arora M.",2017,Environmental Research,"Background Environmental chemical exposures have been implicated in pediatric kidney disease. No appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic. Methods We performed a systematic review of the epidemiologic studies that assessed association of environmental exposures with measures of kidney function and disease in pediatric populations. The search period went through July 2016. Results We found 50 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. Environmental exposures reviewed herein included lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, fluoride, aflatoxin, melamine, environmental tobacco, bisphenol A, dental procedures, phthalates, ferfluorooctanoic acid, triclosan, and thallium/uranium. Most studies assessed environmental chemical exposure via biomarkers but four studies assessed exposure via proximity to emission source. There was mixed evidence of association between metal exposures, and other non-metal environmental exposures and pediatric kidney disease and other kidney disease biomarkers. The evaluation of causality is hampered by the small numbers of studies for each type of environmental exposure, as well as lack of study quality and limited prospective evidence. Conclusion There is a need for well-designed epidemiologic studies of environmental chemical exposures and kidney disease outcomes. © 2017",Children; Environmental exposures; Epidemiology; Kidney disease; Metals,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; aflatoxin; arsenic; biological marker; cadmium; environmental chemical; fluoride; lead; melamine; mercury; metal; perfluorooctanoic acid; thallium; triclosan; uranium; pollutant; biomarker; chemical pollutant; child health; disability; disease; epidemiology; health survey; heavy metal; literature review; pollution exposure; public health; dental procedure; environmental exposure; human; kidney disease; kidney function; pediatrics; priority journal; procedures; quality control; Review; systematic review; tobacco; chemically induced; drug effects; kidney; Kidney Diseases; kidney function test; pollutant; toxicity; Nicotiana tabacum; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Kidney Function Tests",Academic Press Inc.
Endoscopic injection therapy,"Kim S.W., Lee Y.S., Han S.W.",2017,Investigative and Clinical Urology,"Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (Deflux) for the treatment of vesicoureteral reflux, endoscopic injection therapy using Deflux has become a popular alternative to open surgery and continuous antibiotic prophylaxis. Endoscopic correction with Deflux is minimally invasive, well tolerated, and provides cure rates approaching those of open surgery (i.e., approximately 80% in several studies). However, in recent years a less stringent approach to evaluating urinary tract infections (UTIs) and concerns about long-term efficacy and complications associated with endoscopic injection have limited the use of this therapy. In addition, there is little evidence supporting the efficacy of endoscopic injection therapy in preventing UTIs and vesicoureteral reflux-related renal scarring. In this report, we reviewed the current literature regarding endoscopic injection therapy and provided an updated overview of this topic. © The Korean Urological Association, 2017.",Endoscopy; Injections; Vesicoureteral reflux,"copolymer; dextranomer hyaluronic acid copolymer; dimeticone; politef; polyacrylate polyalcohol copolymer; unclassified drug; acrylic acid resin; baysilon; deflux; dextran; dimeticone; hyaluronic acid; politef; urinary tract agent; Vantris; bladder and bowel dysfunction; diagnostic procedure; digestive system disease; diverticulosis; endoscopic injection therapy; endoscopic therapy; follow up; human; medical procedures; meta analysis; paraureteral diverticulum; parenteral drug administration; renal scarring; Review; scar formation; subureteric teflon injection; ureteral duplication; urinary tract infection; vesicoureteral reflux; voiding cystourethrogram; child; complication; endoscopy; infant; injection; newborn; preschool child; procedures; urinary tract infection; vesicoureteral reflux; Acrylic Resins; Child; Child, Preschool; Dextrans; Dimethylpolysiloxanes; Endoscopy; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Injections; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Urinary Tract Infections; Urological Agents; Vesico-Ureteral Reflux",Korean Urological Association
Anaerobic biodegradation of (emerging) organic contaminants in the aquatic environment,"Ghattas A.-K., Fischer F., Wick A., Ternes T.A.",2017,Water Research,"Although strictly anaerobic conditions prevail in several environmental compartments, up to now, biodegradation studies with emerging organic contaminants (EOCs), such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, have mainly focused on aerobic conditions. One of the reasons probably is the assumption that the aerobic degradation is more energetically favorable than degradation under strictly anaerobic conditions. Certain aerobically recalcitrant contaminants, however, are biodegraded under strictly anaerobic conditions and little is known about the organisms and enzymatic processes involved in their degradation. This review provides a comprehensive survey of characteristic anaerobic biotransformation reactions for a variety of well-studied, structurally rather simple contaminants (SMOCs) bearing one or a few different functional groups/structural moieties. Furthermore it summarizes anaerobic degradation studies of more complex contaminants with several functional groups (CMCs), in soil, sediment and wastewater treatment. While strictly anaerobic conditions are able to promote the transformation of several aerobically persistent contaminants, the variety of observed reactions is limited, with reductive dehalogenations and the cleavage of ether bonds being the most prevalent. Thus, it becomes clear that the transferability of degradation mechanisms deduced from culture studies of SMOCs to predict the degradation of CMCs, such as EOCs, in environmental matrices is hampered due the more complex chemical structure bearing different functional groups, different environmental conditions (e.g. matrix, redox, pH), the microbial community (e.g. adaptation, competition) and the low concentrations typical for EOCs. © 2017 The Authors",Anaerobic biodegradation; Biocides; Complex multifunctional contaminants (CMCs); Emerging organic contaminants (EOCs); Pesticides; Pharmaceuticals; Simple mono- or oligofunctional contaminants (SMOCs); Transformation,"Biocides; Biodegradation; Degradation; Dehalogenation; Drug products; Pesticides; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic biodegradation; Complex multifunctional contaminants (CMCs); Emerging organic contaminants; Simple mono- or oligofunctional contaminants (SMOCs); Transformation; Contamination; aldehyde; alkane; alkanol; amine; aromatic compound; azo compound; benzene; carbamazepine; carboxylic acid; diatrizoate; diclofenac; ester; ether; ether derivative; ethylbenzene; glyceryl trinitrate; hydrocarbon; imazosulfuron; metolachlor; o demethylase; perfluoro compound; phenol derivative; polycyclic aromatic compound; polyhalogenated hydrocarbon; sulfamethoxazole; sulfonic acid derivative; toluene; triclosan; trimethoprim; unclassified drug; venlafaxine; waste water; anoxic conditions; aquatic environment; biodegradation; biotransformation; concentration (composition); drug; environmental conditions; microbial community; organic pollutant; pesticide; pollutant removal; water treatment; adaptation; anaerobic metabolism; aquatic environment; biodegradation; biotransformation; chemical bond; dehalogenation; microbial community; organic pollution; oxidation reduction reaction; pH; priority journal; Review; sediment; soil; waste water management; water pollutant; bioremediation; waste water; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biotransformation; Waste Water",Elsevier Ltd
"In-stream detection of waterborne priority pollutants, and applications in drinking water contaminant warning systems",Capodaglio A.G.,2017,Water Science and Technology: Water Supply,"Advancements in real-time water monitoring technologies permit rapid detection of in-stream, inpipe water quality, and alert of threats from waste loads. Legislation mandating the establishment of water resources monitoring, presence of hazardous contaminants in effluents, and perception of the vulnerability of the water distribution system to attacks, have spurred technical and economic interest. Alternatively to traditional analyzers, chemosensors operate according to physical principles, without sample collection (online), and are capable of supplying parameter values continuously and in real-time. This review paper contains a comprehensive survey of existing and expected online monitoring technologies for measurement/detection of pollutants in water. The state-of-the-art in online water monitoring and contaminant warning systems is presented. Application examples are reported. Monitoring costs will become a lesser part of a water utility budget due to the fact that automation and technological simplification will abate human cost factors, and reduce the complexity of laboratory procedures. © IWA Publishing 2017.",Contaminant warning systems; Dangerous pollutants; Emerging pollutants; Instrumentation; Online monitoring; Pollutants,Budget control; Contamination; Effluents; Impurities; Monitoring; Online systems; Partial discharges; Pollution; Potable water; River pollution; Water; Water distribution systems; Water pollution; Water quality; Water resources; Water supply systems; Pollution detection; Dangerous pollutants; Emerging pollutants; Instrumentation; Online monitoring; Pollutants; Pollution detection; Water pollution; drinking water; automation; distribution system; drinking water; hazardous waste; instrumentation; perception; pollutant property; real time; stream; vulnerability; warning system; effluent; laboratory method; operations technology; pollutant; sensor; technological development; water quality; water resource; Article; biosensor; online monitoring; technology; waste water management; water contamination; water pollutant; water quality; alarm monitor; alarm monitoring; automation; budget; cost; event detection system; fingerprinting; human; information technology; inorganic monitor; integrated contaminant warning system; investigative procedures; limit of detection; monitor; organic monitor; physical monitor; water supply,IWA Publishing
Lipid analysis of Chinese cabbage leaves by ultra performance liquid chromatography-time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry,"Zheng S., Zhang Y., Lü J., Xu D.",2017,Chinese Journal of Chromatography (Se Pu),"A method for the lipid analysis of Chinese cabbage leaves was developed by ultra performance liquid chromatography-time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF-MS/MS). The lipid species, structures, fatty acid compositions and relative contents in Chinese cabbage leaves were elucidated. Acquity UPLCTM BEH C8 column was selected as the stationary phase. A fast and efficient chromatographic separation was accomplished within 22 min. TOF-MS scan-information dependent acquisition-product ion scan was performed in ESI positive and negative ion modes to acquire high resolution MS and MS/MS spectra in one injection. Finally, 232 lipids in Chinese cabbage leaves were identified, including 104 phospholipids, 63 glycolipids and 65 glycerides. Among them, phosphatidylcholines and monogalactosyldiacylglycerols were chiefly phospholipids and glycolipids, respectively. Meanwhile, glycerides mainly contained diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols. The results demonstrated that the method for lipid analysis has high sensitivity, good accuracy and high throughput. It provides a reliable analysis platform for lipid metabolism in plants and lay a foundation for further study on biological functions of lipids.",Chinese cabbage; Leaves; Lipid; Ultra performance liquid chromatography-time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF-MS/MS),,Zhongguo Kexueyuan - Chinese Academy of Sciences
Impact of enhanced recovery after surgery and fast track surgery pathways on healthcare-associated infections: Results from a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Grant M.C., Yang D., Wu C.L., Makary M.A., Wick E.C.",2017,Annals of Surgery,"Objective: The aim of this study was to establish if enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) and fast track surgery (FTS) protocols are associated with reduction in healthcare-associated infection (HAIs). Background: Evidence suggests that prevention strategies for HAIs should be multifaceted and transdisciplinary. ERAS and FTS protocols are collaborative approaches to perioperative care which reduce length of stay but may also be an effective strategy for reducing HAIs. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials involving either ERAS or FTS for abdominal or pelvic surgery. Primary outcome included postoperative incidence of 3 major HAIs: lung infection (LI), urinary tract infection (UTI), and surgical site infection (SSI). Results: Among all included trials, ERAS/FTS was associated with a significant reduction in postoperative LI [risk ratio (RR) = 0.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-0.61; P < 0.0001; I2 = 0%], UTI (RR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.23-0.76; P=0.004; I2 =0%), and SSI (RR=0.75; 95% CI=0.58-0.98; P = 0.04; I2 = 0%) compared with conventional controls. Sensitivity analysis performed following the exclusion of high risk of bias publications did not appreciably affect these results. ERAS/FTS was also associated with a significant decrease in hospital length of stay (standard mean difference =-0.83; 95% CI=-0.92 to -0.75; P < 0.0001; P for heterogeneity <0.0001, I2 = 93%). Subgroup analysis of trials involving colorectal surgery and open incision also resulted in significant reduction in all 3 HAIs among ERAS/FTS compared with conventional counterparts. Conclusions: Our results suggest ERAS/FTS protocols are powerful tools to prevent HAIs. Further study is needed to establish the mechanism. Providers should consider adoption of similar transdisciplinary programs to reduce perioperative HAIs and at the same time improve the value of surgical care.

Chapter 9: Research and Non-major Commercial Co- and Terpolymers of Tetrafluoroethylene,"Hercules D.A., Parrish C.A., Thrasher J.S.",2017,RSC Polymer Chemistry Series,"Co- and terpolymers of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) are ubiquitous in terms of commercial fluoropolymers, and the preparations, properties and applications of these outstanding materials have been well documented in monographs, book chapters, review articles, and the patent and scientific journal literature. The purpose of this chapter is not to cover these major commercial materials again, but rather to overview what is known in the patent and scientific journal literature about research-level TFE-based fluoropolymers and some of those TFE-based fluoropolymers that are available only at a minor commercial level. Since our research group represents one of the few academic laboratories that can safely work with TFE on a kilogram scale, it behooves us to be aware of the scientific literature in this field, and it was an instructive exercise for the coauthors to undertake this literature review. As certainly perfluoroalkyl trifluorovinyl ethers, especially CF2CFOCF3 and CF2CFOCF2CF2CF3, have a prominent place in commercial co- and terpolymers of TFE (e.g. PFA resins, fluoroelastomers), it was decided to begin this chapter with an overview of co- and terpolymers of TFE with all alkyl vinyl ethers, non-fluorinated, partially fluorinated and perfluorinated alkyl vinyl ethers, including those with a reactive functionality(ies) on the end of the alkyl group. We then move to a coverage of co- and terpolymers of TFE with ethylenic monomers, again non-fluorinated, partially fluorinated and perfluorinated ethylenic monomers, with the obvious exclusion of major commercial TFE-based fluoropolymers such as ETFE, FEP and others. The final section is devoted to overviewing co- and terpolymers of TFE with cyclic monomers, an area that became especially important in the 2000s as fluoropolymer chemistry attempted to aid the continuance of Moore's law with improved materials for photoresists, etc. Overall, the accompanying literature survey is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to provide as comprehensive a review as possible within the space available. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.",,,Royal Society of Chemistry
Annotation Graphs: A Graph-Based Visualization for Meta-Analysis of Data Based on User-Authored Annotations,"Zhao J., Glueck M., Breslav S., Chevalier F., Khan A.",2017,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,"User-authored annotations of data can support analysts in the activity of hypothesis generation and sensemaking, where it is not only critical to document key observations, but also to communicate insights between analysts. We present annotation graphs, a dynamic graph visualization that enables meta-analysis of data based on user-authored annotations. The annotation graph topology encodes annotation semantics, which describe the content of and relations between data selections, comments, and tags. We present a mixed-initiative approach to graph layout that integrates an analyst's manual manipulations with an automatic method based on similarity inferred from the annotation semantics. Various visual graph layout styles reveal different perspectives on the annotation semantics. Annotation graphs are implemented within C8, a system that supports authoring annotations during exploratory analysis of a dataset. We apply principles of Exploratory Sequential Data Analysis (ESDA) in designing C8, and further link these to an existing task typology in the visualization literature. We develop and evaluate the system through an iterative user-centered design process with three experts, situated in the domain of analyzing HCI experiment data. The results suggest that annotation graphs are effective as a method of visually extending user-authored annotations to data meta-analysis for discovery and organization of ideas. © 2016 IEEE.",exploratory sequential data analysis; Externalization; graph-based visualization; user-authored annotation,Data handling; Human computer interaction; Information analysis; Iterative methods; Semantics; Topology; User centered design; Visualization; Annotation Graphs; Exploratory analysis; Externalization; Graph-based visualization; Hypothesis generation; Iterative user-centered design; Sequential data analysis; user-authored annotation; Data visualization; article; data analysis; exploratory research; human; meta analysis; semantics,IEEE Computer Society
Is There a Safe and Effective Way to Treat Trigeminal Neuralgia Associated with Vertebrobasilar Dolichoectasia? Presentation of 8 Cases and Literature Review,"Vanaclocha V., Herrera J.M., Martínez-Gómez D., Rivera-Paz M., Calabuig-Bayo C., Vanaclocha L.",2016,World Neurosurgery,"Objective Surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) associated with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia is challenging. We analyze the treatments for this disease, discussing the advantages and drawbacks, and present our own technique and series. Methods This retrospective study covered the period January 2006 through January 2016. Vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia deviation from midline, basilar artery (BA) and vertebral artery diameter, and BA apex distance above the posterior clinoid process were measured on preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. The BA was repositioned and kept in place with coagulation of the clival dura, Teflon pledgets, and fibrin glue. We also performed a thorough literature review using PubMed. Results Our cases included 5 men and 3 women with mean age 64.88 years ± 10.32 (range, 48–81 years); 7 cases were TN, and 1 case was painful tic convulsif. Pain was on the left side in 6 cases and on the right in 2 cases. All cases affected cranial nerve V2 and/or V3 divisions. Both V2 and V3 were affected in 4 cases, V3 was affected in 3 cases, and V2 was affected in 1 case. Hypertension was present in 5 cases. TN disappeared postoperatively in all cases. One patient took clonazepam 2 mg/24 hours for 3 months because of facial dysesthesia. Postoperative complications included hearing loss in 1 patient; facial paresis plus diplopia in 1 patient, which resolved in 3 months; and arterial hypertension. Postoperative arterial hypertension improved in all affected patients, although only 2 patients discontinued antihypertensive medications. Mean follow-up time was 56.50 months ± 40.08 (range, 14 months to 9 years 9 months). No patient showed pain recurrence. Conclusions TN associated with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia can be treated surgically with minimal morbidity. BA repositioning has the highest success rate. Our technique of inducing a dural scar to fix the BA in its new position away from the trigeminal nerve is simple, not technically demanding, and highly effective. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Microvascular decompression; Open posterior trigeminal rhizotomy; Painful tic convulsif; Trigeminal nerve; Trigeminal neuralgia; Vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia,"antihypertensive agent; clonazepam; fibrin glue; politef; basilar artery; basilar artery apex distance; cerebrovascular disease; diplopia; disease association; drug withdrawal; dura mater; dysesthesia; face disorder; facial nerve paralysis; follow up; hearing impairment; human; hypertension; microvascular decompression; nervous system parameters; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; patient safety; retrospective study; Review; systematic review; therapy effect; trigeminus neuralgia; vertebral artery diameter; vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia; aged; complication; diagnostic imaging; female; male; middle aged; procedures; Trigeminal Neuralgia; vertebrobasilar insufficiency; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Microvascular Decompression Surgery; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Trigeminal Neuralgia; Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency",Elsevier Inc.
Prevention of pelvic floor disorders: international urogynecological association research and development committee opinion,"Bazi T., Takahashi S., Ismail S., Bø K., Ruiz-Zapata A.M., Duckett J., Kammerer-Doak D.",2016,International Urogynecology Journal,"Introduction and hypothesis: Pelvic floor disorders (PFD), including urinary incontinence, anal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse, are common and have a negative effect on the quality of life of women. Treatment is associated with morbidity and may not be totally satisfactory. Prevention of PFDs, when possible, should be a primary goal. The purpose of this paper is to summarise the current literature and give an evidence-based review of the prevention of PFDs Methods: A working subcommittee from the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) Research and Development (R&D) Committee was formed. An initial document addressing the prevention of PFDs was drafted, based on a review of the English-language literature. After evaluation by the entire IUGA R&D Committee, revisions were made. The final document represents the IUGA R&D Committee Opinion on the prevention of PFDs. Results: This R&D Committee Opinion reviews the literature on the prevention of PFDs and summarises the findings with evidence-based recommendations. Conclusions: Pelvic floor disorders have a long latency, and may go through periods of remission, thus making causality difficult to confirm. Nevertheless, prevention strategies targeting modifiable risk factors should be incorporated into clinical practice before the absence of symptomatology. © 2016, The International Urogynecological Association.",IUGA Research and Development Committee Opinion; Obstetric anal sphincter injuries; Pelvic floor disorders; Pelvic organ prolapse; Prevention; Urinary incontinence,alcohol; caffeine; estrogen; vitamin D; Article; asthma; body posture; carbonated beverage; cesarean section; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; constipation; diabetes mellitus; epidural analgesia; episiotomy; estrogen therapy; evidence based medicine; feces incontinence; female; fluid intake; human; instrumental delivery; intrapartum care; labor stage 2; massage; medical society; obesity; obstetric delivery; pelvic floor disorder; pelvic organ prolapse; physical activity; practice guideline; pregnancy; prenatal care; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; smoking; urine incontinence; consensus development; Pelvic Floor Disorders; Female; Humans; Pelvic Floor Disorders,Springer London
Disruption of TCA Cycle and Glutamate Metabolism Identified by Metabolomics in an In Vitro Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,"Veyrat-Durebex C., Corcia P., Piver E., Devos D., Dangoumau A., Gouel F., Vourc’h P., Emond P., Laumonnier F., Nadal-Desbarats L., Gordon P.H., Andres C.R., Blasco H.",2016,Molecular Neurobiology,"This study aims to develop a cellular metabolomics model that reproduces the pathophysiological conditions found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in order to improve knowledge of disease physiology. We used a co-culture model combining the motor neuron-like cell line NSC-34 and the astrocyte clone C8-D1A, with each over-expressing wild-type or G93C mutant human SOD1, to examine amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) physiology. We focused on the effects of mutant human SOD1 as well as oxidative stress induced by menadione on intracellular metabolism using a metabolomics approach through gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Preliminary non-supervised analysis by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that cell type, genetic environment, and time of culture influenced the metabolomics profiles. Supervised analysis using orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) on data from intracellular metabolomics profiles of SOD1G93C co-cultures produced metabolites involved in glutamate metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle. This study revealed the feasibility of using a metabolomics approach in a cellular model of ALS. We identified potential disruption of the TCA cycle and glutamate metabolism under oxidative stress, which is consistent with prior research in the disease.

Environmental chemicals in an urban population of pregnant women and their newborns from San Francisco,"Morello-Frosch R., Cushing L.J., Jesdale B.M., Schwartz J.M., Guo W., Guo T., Wang M., Harwani S., Petropoulou S.-S.E., Duong W., Park J.-S., Petreas M., Gajek R., Alvaran J., She J., Dobraca D., Das R., Woodruff T.J.",2016,Environmental Science and Technology,"Exposures to environmental pollutants in utero may increase the risk of adverse health effects. We measured the concentrations of 59 potentially harmful chemicals in 77 maternal and 65 paired umbilical cord blood samples collected in San Francisco during 2010-2011, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs), and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in serum and metals in whole blood. Consistent with previous studies, we found evidence that concentrations of mercury (Hg) and lower-brominated PBDEs were often higher in umbilical cord blood or serum than in maternal samples (median cord:maternal ratio > 1), while for most PFCs and lead (Pb), concentrations in cord blood or serum were generally equal to or lower than their maternal pair (median cord:maternal ratio ≤ 1). In contrast to the conclusions of a recent review, we found evidence that several PCBs and OCPs were also often higher in cord than maternal serum (median cord:maternal ratio > 1) when concentrations are assessed on a lipid-adjusted basis. Our findings suggest that for many chemicals, fetuses may experience higher exposures than their mothers and highlight the need to characterize potential health risks and inform policies aimed at reducing sources of exposure. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Blood; Chemicals; Health risks; Lead compounds; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Adverse health effects; Environmental chemicals; Environmental pollutants; Organochlorine pesticides; Perfluorinated compound (PFCs); Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Potential health risks; Organic pollutants; chlorphenotane; environmental chemical; mercury; organochlorine pesticide; perfluoro compound; perfluorodecanoic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; chlorinated hydrocarbon; diphenyl ether derivative; pollutant; environmental fate; health risk; organochlorine pesticide; PCB; pregnancy; serum; urban population; womens health; Article; blood sampling; bromination; California; concentration (parameters); female; halogenation; human; hydroxylation; lipophilicity; newborn; pregnant woman; prenatal exposure; umbilical cord; urban population; environmental monitoring; fetomaternal transfusion; maternal exposure; pollutant; pregnancy; California; San Francisco [California]; United States; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Exposure; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Pregnancy; San Francisco; Urban Population",American Chemical Society
Cobalt–copper based catalysts for higher terminal alcohols synthesis via Fischer–Tropsch reaction,"Xiang Y., Kruse N.",2016,Journal of Energy Chemistry,"The production of higher terminal alcohols through CO hydrogenation according to the Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) process has been a topic of interest since the Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP) demonstrated short-chain C1–C6 mixed alcohols production over cobalt–copper based catalysts. A number of catalyst formulations were screened for their suitability at that time. In particular, the addition of Cr, Zn, Al, Mn and V to CoCu was investigated. In a number of patents, it was shown that catalyst preparation is crucial in these catalyst formulations and that high alcohols selectivity can only be achieved by carefully respecting the procedures and recipes. This short critical review highlights recent developments in CoCu-based catalysts for higher terminal alcohols synthesis via F–T synthesis. Special attention will be given to catalyst preparation which according to developments in our group is based on oxalate precipitation. This way we show that the close association of Co and Cu on the one hand and promoter/dispersant on the other are of utmost importance to ensure high performance of the catalysts. We shall concentrate on “CoCuMn”, “CoCuMo” and “CoCuNb” catalyst formulations, all prepared via oxalate precipitation and combined with “entrainment techniques” if necessary, and show high total alcohols selectivity can be obtained with tunable Anderson-Schulz-Flory chain-lengthening probability. Either long-chain C8–C14 terminal alcohols as feedstock for plasticizers, lubricants and detergents, or short-chain C2–C5 alcohols as “alkanol” fuels or fuel additives can be formed this way. © 2016 Science Press",Cobalt–copper; Fischer–Tropsch; Higher terminal alcohols; Oxalate; Promoter,Catalysts; Chains; Cobalt; Copper; Fuel additives; Manganese; Oxalic acid; Soaps (detergents); Solvents; Alcohols synthesis; Catalyst preparation; CO hydrogenation; Copper-based catalysts; Critical review; Oxalate; Oxalate precipitation; Promoter; Catalyst selectivity,Elsevier B.V.
To close or not to close: contemporary indications for patent foramen ovale closure,"Zier L.S., Sievert H., Mahadevan V.S.",2016,Expert Review of Cardiovascular Therapy,"Introduction: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a common congenital cardiac abnormality and that has been associated with several disease processes including transient ischemic attacks (TIA), stroke, migraine headaches with aura, decompression sickness, platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome, and shunt induced cyanosis. Controversy exists regarding closure of PFO as a therapeutic treatment modality for these disease processes. This review addresses the contemporary clinical indications for PFO closure. Areas covered: We conducted a comprehensive literature search of contemporary research studies focusing on randomized trials and meta-analyses comparing medical therapy and device closure of PFOs for the treatment of PFO associated clinical syndromes. We synthesized this literature into a review addressing indications for PFO closure in stroke, TIA, migraine headaches with aura, decompression sickness, platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome, and shunt induced cyanosis. Expert commentary: Because in many PFO associated conditions it can be difficult to determine the degree to which the PFO is a causative factor in the disease process, we recommend a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to exclude other obvious etiologies of PFO associated conditions before implicating the PFO and proceeding with closure. However in the properly selected patient population there is growing clinical experience and experimental evidence suggesting that closure of PFO is a safe and effective treatment modality. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",closure devices; decompression sickness; migraine headache; Patent foramen ovale; platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome; stroke; transient ischemic attack; venous thromboembolism,"blood clotting disorder; cerebrovascular accident; cyanosis; decompression sickness; disease association; dyspnea; embryology; follow up; heart disease; human; hypercoaguability disorder; interatrial septum; migraine with aura; patent foramen ovale; pathophysiology; patient selection; platypnea orthodeoxia syndrome; prevalence; Review; right sided cardiac disease; septal occluder; shunt induced cyanosis; transient ischemic attack; treatment indication; venous thromboembolism; complication; devices; Foramen Ovale, Patent; heart catheterization; meta analysis (topic); prosthesis implantation; randomized controlled trial (topic); Stroke; treatment outcome; anticoagulant agent; antithrombocytic agent; Anticoagulants; Cardiac Catheterization; Foramen Ovale, Patent; Humans; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Prosthesis Implantation; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Septal Occluder Device; Stroke; Treatment Outcome",Taylor and Francis Ltd
Effect of environmental contaminants on spermatogenesis,"Jenardhanan P., Panneerselvam M., Mathur P.P.",2016,Seminars in Cell and Developmental Biology,"Indiscriminate use of synthetic chemical compounds and the unregulated presence of heavy metals threatens the integral reproducibility of mankind and other living organisms. The toxicity of these compounds far outweighs the usefulness of these compounds. Male reproductive health is linked to the process of spermatogenesis and there is a general consensus that males are more sensitive to these environmental contaminants and so significantly affected when compared to their female counterparts. The review discusses the various toxic contaminants polluting the environment and the effect of these compounds on spermatogenesis and its relevance on male infertility in humans. It provides a detailed report on the chemical nature of few selected reprotoxicants like estrogen analogues, phthalates, dioxins, heavy metals and their action mechanism on various cellular targets that play a role in spermatogenesis with special highlights at the genetic and molecular levels. Understanding the toxicity of these compounds serves a dual purpose; to develop counter measures to protect ourselves from cellular damage and to use these compounds as a model to better understand the intricate process of spermatogenesis.

Analytical strategies to the determination of metal-containing nanoparticles in environmental waters,"Leopold K., Philippe A., Wörle K., Schaumann G.E.",2016,TrAC - Trends in Analytical Chemistry,"Metal-containing nanoparticles (MNPs) represent emerging pollutants that still pose analytical challenges for their determination in environmentally relevant samples, including extremely low MNPs’ concentrations, high colloidal background and the need to perform speciation analysis. Complementary to traditional state-of-the-art techniques evaluated elsewhere, this review additionally evaluates less conventional approaches for sample pretreatment, preconcentration, on- and offline detection, size characterisation and quantification of MNPs in environmental samples. Preconcentration techniques, like cloud point extraction and solid phase extraction, provide high preconcentration factors and recoveries. Electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry opens interesting perspectives in the still unresolved distinction between dissolved ions and nanoparticles. Combination of single particle ICP-MS with size fractionation techniques, like hydrodynamic chromatography or electrospray-differential mobility analysis, is highly promising for assessment of shape and structure-related information of MNPs and their aggregates. Although highly relevant, the validation and production of reference materials and quantitative criteria on measurement certainty still require further development. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Analytical method validation; Characterization; Determination; Environmental waters; Metal-containing nanoparticles analysis; Nanoparticle reference materials; Separation,Absorption spectroscopy; Agglomeration; Atomic absorption spectrometry; Characterization; Chromatography; Effluent treatment; Extraction; Metal analysis; Nanoparticles; Particle size analysis; Phase separation; Separation; Analytical method validation; Determination; Environmental water; Metal-containing nanoparticles; Reference material; Metal nanoparticles; metal containing nanoparticle; nanoparticle; unclassified drug; water; analytic method; atomic absorption spectrometry; chemical analysis; chromatography; cloud point extraction; electrophoresis; electrospray mass spectrometry; extraction; field flow fractionation; high performance liquid chromatography; hydrodynamic chromatography; limit of detection; liquid liquid extraction; mass spectrometry; physical chemistry; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Review; size exclusion chromatography; solid phase extraction; validation study; water analysis,Elsevier B.V.
Is toxicant-induced Sertoli cell injury in vitro a useful model to study molecular mechanisms in spermatogenesis?,"Li N., Mruk D.D., Lee W.M., Wong C.K.C., Cheng C.Y.",2016,Seminars in Cell and Developmental Biology,"Sertoli cells isolated from rodents or humans and cultured in vitro are known to establish a functional tight junction (TJ)-permeability barrier that mimics the blood–testis barrier (BTB) in vivo. This model has been widely used by investigators to study the biology of the TJ and the BTB. Studies have shown that environmental toxicants (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), bisphenol A (BPA) and cadmium) that exert their disruptive effects to induce Sertoli cell injury using this in vitro model are reproducible in studies in vivo. Thus, this in vitro system provides a convenient approach to probe the molecular mechanism(s) underlying toxicant-induced testis injury but also to provide new insights in understanding spermatogenesis, such as the biology of cell adhesion, BTB restructuring that supports preleptotene spermatocyte transport, and others. Herein, we provide a brief and critical review based on studies using this in vitro model of Sertoli cell cultures using primary cells isolated from rodent testes vs. humans to monitor environmental toxicant-mediated Sertoli cell injury. In short, recent findings have shown that environmental toxicants exert their effects on Sertoli cells to induce testis injury through their action on Sertoli cell actin- and/or microtubule-based cytoskeleton. These effects are mediated via their disruptive effects on actin- and/or microtubule-binding proteins. Sertoli cells also utilize differential spatiotemporal expression of these actin binding proteins to confer plasticity to the BTB to regulate germ cell transport across the BTB. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Actin cytoskeleton; Blood–testis barrier; Ectoplasmic specialization; Sertoli cells; Spermatogenesis; Testis; Toxicants,"ABP protein; actin; F actin; focal adhesion kinase; protein; toxic substance; tyrosine; unclassified drug; animal cell; cell damage; cytoskeleton; cytotoxicity; environmental exposure; human; in vitro study; male; microfilament; microtubule; nonhuman; protein expression; rat; reproductive toxicity; Review; Sertoli cell; spermatogenesis; testis injury; animal; biological model; drug effects; metabolism; pathology; pollutant; Sertoli cell; spermatogenesis; toxicity; Animals; Cytoskeleton; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Sertoli Cells; Spermatogenesis",Academic Press
Which molecular features affect the intrinsic hepatic clearance rate of ionizable organic chemicals in fish?,"Chen Y., Hermens J.L.M., Jonker M.T.O., Arnot J.A., Armitage J.M., Brown T., Nichols J.W., Fay K.A., Droge S.T.J.",2016,Environmental Science and Technology,"Greater knowledge of biotransformation rates for ionizable organic compounds (IOCs) in fish is required to properly assess the bioaccumulation potential of many environmentally relevant contaminants. In this study, we measured in vitro hepatic clearance rates for 50 IOCs using a pooled batch of liver S9 fractions isolated from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The IOCs included four types of strongly ionized acids (carboxylates, phenolates, sulfonates, and sulfates), three types of strongly ionized bases (primary, secondary, tertiary amines), and a pair of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). Included in this test set were several surfactants and a series of beta-blockers. For linear alkyl chain IOC analogues, biotransformation enzymes appeared to act directly on the charged terminal group, with the highest clearance rates for tertiary amines and sulfates and no clearance of QACs. Clearance rates for C12-IOCs were higher than those for C8-IOC analogues. Several analogue series with multiple alkyl chains, branched alkyl chains, aromatic rings, and nonaromatic rings were evaluated. The likelihood of multiple reaction pathways made it difficult to relate all differences in clearance to specific molecular features the tested IOCs. Future analysis of primary metabolites in the S9 assay is recommended to further elucidate biotransformation pathways for IOCs in fish.

Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and measures of human fertility: a systematic review,"Bach C.C., Vested A., Jørgensen K.T., Bonde J.P.E., Henriksen T.B., Toft G.",2016,Critical Reviews in Toxicology,"Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are found widespread in the environment and humans. The relation of PFASs to fertility has now been examined in a relatively large number of epidemiologic studies and a synthesis is in order. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFASs and measures of human fertility, with particular emphasis on perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Systematic literature searches were initially conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE and subsequently in references and citations of included papers. Studies were included if they assessed exposure to PFASs in biological samples in relation to reproductive hormones, semen characteristics, or time to pregnancy (TTP). Study characteristics and results were abstracted to predefined forms, and the studies were assessed for the risk of bias and confounding. Sixteen studies investigated the association between PFAS exposure in men and semen parameters, reproductive hormone levels, or TTP. There was a lack of consistent results among the numerous investigated exposure-outcome combinations. However, subtle associations between higher PFOS and lower testosterone or abnormal semen morphology cannot be excluded. Eleven studies assessed the association between PFAS exposure in women and TTP or reproductive hormones levels. Four of eight studies found prolonged TTP with higher PFOS or PFOA, but only one study found an association when restricting to nulliparous women. In men, there is little evidence of an association between PFAS exposure and semen quality or levels of reproductive hormones. For PFOS and PFOA, the literature indicates an association with female fecundability in parous women, which is most likely not causal. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Epidemiology; fecundability; fecundity; fertility; humans; perfluorinated compounds; perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances; perfluorooctane sulfonate; perfluorooctanoate; semen quality; time to pregnancy,alkyl group; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pollutant; environmental exposure; female; fertility; hormone determination; human; infertility; male; outcome assessment; Review; risk assessment; semen analysis; systematic review; time to pregnancy; drug effects; fertility; pollutant; reproduction; toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Environmental Pollutants; Fertility; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Reproduction,Taylor and Francis Ltd
Consumer Product Chemicals in Indoor Dust: A Quantitative Meta-analysis of U.S. Studies,"Mitro S.D., Dodson R.E., Singla V., Adamkiewicz G., Elmi A.F., Tilly M.K., Zota A.R.",2016,Environmental Science and Technology,"Indoor dust is a reservoir for commercial consumer product chemicals, including many compounds with known or suspected health effects. However, most dust exposure studies measure few chemicals in small samples. We systematically searched the U.S. indoor dust literature on phthalates, replacement flame retardants (RFRs), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), synthetic fragrances, and environmental phenols and estimated pooled geometric means (GMs) and 95% confidence intervals for 45 chemicals measured in ≥3 data sets. In order to rank and contextualize these results, we used the pooled GMs to calculate residential intake from dust ingestion, inhalation, and dermal uptake from air, and then identified hazard traits from the Safer Consumer Products Candidate Chemical List. Our results indicate that U.S. indoor dust consistently contains chemicals from multiple classes. Phthalates occurred in the highest concentrations, followed by phenols, RFRs, fragrance, and PFASs. Several phthalates and RFRs had the highest residential intakes. We also found that many chemicals in dust share hazard traits such as reproductive and endocrine toxicity. We offer recommendations to maximize comparability of studies and advance indoor exposure science. This information is critical in shaping future exposure and health studies, especially related to cumulative exposures, and in providing evidence for intervention development and public policy. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Air intakes; Consumer products; Dust; Esters; Flame retardants; Housing; Phenols; Search engines; Confidence interval; Cumulative exposures; Geometric mean; Health effects; Indoor exposure; Multiple class; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Synthetic fragrances; Chemical hazards; flame retardant; fragrance; organophosphate; perfluoroalkyl substance; phenol derivative; phthalic acid; unclassified drug; dust; confidence interval; dust; indoor air; meta-analysis; organic compound; phenol; phthalate; policy development; pollution exposure; public health; social policy; toxicity; Article; dust; dust exposure; health hazard; human; ingestion; inhalation; policy; United States; environmental monitoring; housing; indoor air pollution; meta analysis; United States; Air Pollution, Indoor; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Flame Retardants; Housing; Humans",American Chemical Society
Is Tibiofemoral or Patellofemoral Alignment or Trochlear Morphology Associated With Patellofemoral Osteoarthritis? A Systematic Review,"Macri E.M., Stefanik J.J., Khan K.K., Crossley K.M.",2016,Arthritis Care and Research,"Objective: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the associations of knee alignment or trochlear morphology (measured on imaging) with presence, severity, onset, and/or progression of patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). Methods: We prospectively registered our protocol with PROSPERO (International prospective register of systematic reviews) and followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to report this review. We searched 10 electronic databases, screened citing articles, and reviewed reference lists. We extracted data and evaluated methodologic quality. Due to study design heterogeneity, we used a best-evidence synthesis to summarize the evidence. Results: We included 16 publications (2,892 participants, 66% women) after removing 4 papers that did not meet our threshold for methodologic quality. There were 11 cross-sectional and 5 longitudinal papers. The target population was knee OA in 11 studies, PFOA in 2 studies, and other knee conditions in 3 studies. Alignment or morphology was measured using radiographs in 8 studies, magnetic resonance imaging in 7 studies, and computed tomography in 2 papers. Limitations include substantial heterogeneity in samples and methods, short followup times in longitudinal studies, and a small number of studies that specifically recruited participants with PFOA. Conclusion: There is strong evidence that PFOA is associated with both trochlear morphology and frontal plane knee alignment, while evidence is limited but consistent in the sagittal and axial planes. These findings suggest that alignment should be evaluated clinically in individuals with PFOA. Clinical interventions targeting knee alignment warrant further investigation. © 2016, American College of Rheumatology",,adult; aged; computer assisted tomography; disease association; disease course; disease severity; female; human; joint malformation; knee disease; knee osteoarthritis; knee radiography; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patellofemoral malalignment; patellofemoral osteoarthritis; prospective study; Review; systematic review; tibiofemoral malalignment; trochlear dysplasia,John Wiley and Sons Inc.
Metabolic targets of endocrine disrupting chemicals assessed by cord blood transcriptome profiling,"Remy S., Govarts E., Wens B., De Boever P., Den Hond E., Croes K., Sioen I., Baeyens W., van Larebeke N., Koppe J., Covaci A., Schettgen T., Nelen V., Legler J., Schoeters G.",2016,Reproductive Toxicology,"Early life exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has been frequently associated with impaired perinatal growth, an important risk factor for later onset of metabolic disorders. We analyzed whether the cord blood transcriptome showed early indications of alterations in metabolic processes in 195 human samples in relation to cord blood levels of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE), polychlorinated biphenyl-153 (PCB-153), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Overall, 39 metabolically relevant transcription factors were significantly enriched (31 by p,p′-DDE, 10 by PCB-153, 8 by PFOA, and 2 by PFOS). These included the glucocorticoid receptor (p,p′-DDE and PCB-153) and the progesterone receptor (PFOA and PFOS). The ‘insulin receptor signaling’, ‘acute phase response signaling’, ‘Interleukin(IL)-6 signaling’, and ‘prolactin signaling’ pathways were significantly enriched in relation to p,p′-DDE. Transcriptional changes at birth suggest a role for specific metabolic targets as a link between prenatal EDC exposure and metabolic disorders later in life. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Birth cohort; Cord blood; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Glucocorticoid receptor; Metabolic disorders; Transcriptomics,"dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene; endocrine disruptor; glucocorticoid receptor; interleukin 6; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl 153; progesterone receptor; transcriptome; unclassified drug; arsenic; chlorinated hydrocarbon; endocrine disruptor; fluorocarbon; heavy metal; phthalic acid derivative; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; cytokine response; female; human; informed consent; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; male; metabolic disorder; newborn; prenatal exposure; signal transduction; umbilical cord blood; adult; Belgium; blood; chemistry; environmental monitoring; fetus blood; gene expression profiling; pollutant; pregnancy; Adult; Arsenic; Belgium; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fetal Blood; Fluorocarbons; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Infant, Newborn; Male; Metals, Heavy; Phthalic Acids; Pregnancy",Elsevier Inc.
Clean Chemistry for Elemental Impurities Analysis of Pharmaceuticals in Compliance with USP 232,Jin C.,2016,AAPS PharmSciTech,"United States Pharmacopeia updated its 100 years old metal analysis method with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). These sensitive instruments require that sample preparation be at least as sophisticated as the instrumentation used in the analysis. Sample contamination during sample preparation has to be controlled to an acceptable level given the low detection limit of these instruments and the ubiquitous presence of elements. This article focused on sample contamination during sample preparation. Contaminations from environment, reagents, and lab apparatus were investigated for their impact on trace element analysis.

Identification of Biomarkers of Exposure to FTOHs and PAPs in Humans Using a Targeted and Nontargeted Analysis Approach,"Dagnino S., Strynar M.J., McMahen R.L., Lau C.S., Ball C., Garantziotis S., Webster T.F., McClean M.D., Lindstrom A.B.",2016,Environmental Science and Technology,"Although historic perfluorinated compounds are currently under scrutiny and growing regulatory control in the world, little is known about human exposure to other polyfluorinated compounds presently in use. Fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (PAPs) are known to degrade to terminal perfluorinated acids and toxic reactive intermediates through metabolic pathways. Therefore, it is important to characterize their human exposure by the identification of unique biomarkers. With the use of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-time-of-flight analysis (LC-MS-TOF), we developed a workflow for the identification of metabolites for the 8:2 FTOH and 8:2 diPAP. Analysis of serum and urine of dosed rats indicated the 8:2 FTOH-sulfate and the 8:2 diPAP as potential biomarkers. These compounds, as well as 25 other fluorinated compounds and metabolites, were analyzed in human serum and urine samples from the general population (n = 100) and office workers (n = 30). The 8:2 FTOH-sulfate was measured for the first time in human samples in 5 to 10% of the serum samples, ranging from 50 to 80 pg/mL. The 8:2 diPAP was measured in 58% of the samples, ranging from 100 to 800 pg/mL.

Screening halogenated environmental contaminants in biota based on isotopic pattern and mass defect provided by high resolution mass spectrometry profiling,"Cariou R., Omer E., Léon A., Dervilly-Pinel G., Le Bizec B.",2016,Analytica Chimica Acta,"In the present work, we addressed the question of global seeking/screening organohalogenated compounds in a large panel of complex biological matrices, with a particular focus on unknown chemicals that may be considered as potential emerging hazards. A fishing strategy was developed based on untargeted profiling among full scan acquisition datasets provided by high resolution mass spectrometry. Since large datasets arise from such profiling, filtering useful information stands as a central question. In this way, we took advantage of the exact mass differences between Cl and Br isotopes. Indeed, our workflow involved an innovative Visual Basic for Applications script aiming at pairing features according to this mass difference, in order to point out potential organohalogenated clusters, preceded by an automated peak picking step based on the centWave function (xcms package of open access R programming environment). Then, H/Cl-scale mass defect plots were used to visualize the datasets before and after filtering. The filtering script was successfully applied to a dataset generated upon liquid chromatography coupled to ESI(−)-HRMS measurement from one eel muscle extract, allowing for realistic manual investigations of filtered clusters. Starting from 9789 initial obtained features, 1994 features were paired in 589 clusters. Hexabromocyclododecane, chlorinated paraffin series and various other compounds have been identified or tentatively identified, allowing thus broad screening of organohalogenated compounds in this extract. Although realistic, manual review of paired clusters remains time consuming and much effort should be devoted to automation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Chemical risk assessment; Chlorinated paraffins; Emerging contaminants; Fit-for-purpose data processing; HRMS screening; Visual Basic Script,"Biohazards; Chemical hazards; Chromatography; Data handling; Defects; Filtration; Isotopes; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Paraffins; Risk assessment; Spectrometry; Visual BASIC; Chemical risk assessment; Chlorinated paraffins; Emerging contaminant; Environmental contaminant; Fit for purpose; Hexabromocyclododecanes; High resolution mass spectrometry; Visual basic for applications; Information filtering; bromide ion; chloride ion; halogenated hydrocarbon; Anguilla anguilla; animal tissue; Article; chemical analysis; chemical procedures; concentration (parameters); electrospray; information processing; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; physical chemistry; physical parameters; priority journal; process design; temperature measurement; workflow; analysis; environmental monitoring; isotope labeling; mass spectrometry; pollutant; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Hydrocarbons, Halogenated; Isotope Labeling; Mass Spectrometry",Elsevier B.V.
QTL meta-analysis of root traits in Brassica napus under contrasting phosphorus supply in two growth systems,"Zhang Y., Thomas C.L., Xiang J., Long Y., Wang X., Zou J., Luo Z., Ding G., Cai H., Graham N.S., Hammond J.P., King G.J., White P.J., Xu F., Broadley M.R., Shi L., Meng J.",2016,Scientific Reports,"A high-density SNP-based genetic linkage map was constructed and integrated with a previous map in the Tapidor x Ningyou7 (TNDH) Brassica napus population, giving a new map with a total of 2041 molecular markers and an average marker density which increased from 0.39 to 0.97 (0.82 SNP bin) per cM. Root and shoot traits were screened under low and 'normal' phosphate (Pi) supply using a 'pouch and wick' system, and had been screened previously in an agar based system. The P-efficient parent Ningyou7 had a shorter primary root length (PRL), greater lateral root density (LRD) and a greater shoot biomass than the P-inefficient parent Tapidor under both treatments and growth systems. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis identified a total of 131 QTL, and QTL meta-analysis found four integrated QTL across the growth systems. Integration reduced the confidence interval by ∼41%. QTL for root and shoot biomass were co-located on chromosome A3 and for lateral root emergence were co-located on chromosomes A4/C4 and C8/C9. There was a major QTL for LRD on chromosome C9 explaining ∼18% of the phenotypic variation. QTL underlying an increased LRD may be a useful breeding target for P uptake efficiency in Brassica. © The Author(s) 2016.",,"phosphorus; genetics; growth, development and aging; meta analysis; plant root; quantitative trait; rapeseed; shoot; single nucleotide polymorphism; Brassica napus; Phosphorus; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait, Heritable",Nature Publishing Group
Analysis of pulse propagation through multilayer plasmonic waveguides in the quasi-bound mode region,"Golmohammadi S., Ghandi-Parsi S.",2016,Journal of Optical Technology (A Translation of Opticheskii Zhurnal),"We present a numerical analysis of surface plasmon dispersion and the nonlinear nature of wave propagation on different smooth waveguides with lossy noble metal films. We also analyze the effective parameters that can affect the dispersion behavior of a thin dielectric slab waveguide embedded in a symmetric metal film. Three kinds of metal (silver, gold, and copper) with Johnson-Christy constants have been utilized in waveguides. Four kinds of dielectric material (air, Teflon, FR-4, and silicon) have been employed in the insulator layer of the metal-insulator- metal waveguide. The dispersion curve of the metal-insulator-metal waveguide with different metal and dielectric arrangements has been studied numerically. By multi-nominal fitting of dispersion curves, we have derived the nonlinear properties of Gaussian (chirped) wave propagation, dispersion length, and pulse broadening through a three-layer plasmonic waveguide. A comparison of three-layered plasmonic waveguides with different guiding layers has been accomplished. Simulation results have shown that dispersion curves with a larger peak and a quasibound mode cause the Gaussian waves to be dispersed and broadened during longer traveling distances. The achieved results serve an impressive function in the design of optical switches and delay lines. © 2017 Optical Society of America.",,Curve fitting; Dielectric materials; Metal analysis; Metal insulator boundaries; Metallic films; Metals; MIM devices; Optical switches; Optical waveguides; Plasmons; Precious metals; Semiconductor insulator boundaries; Wave propagation; Waveguides; Dielectric slab waveguides; Dispersion behavior; Dispersion length; Effective parameters; Metal-insulator-metal waveguides; Nonlinear properties; Plasmonic waveguides; Pulse propagation; Dispersion (waves),OSA - The Optical Society
Degradation and Removal Methods for Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Water,"Merino N., Qu Y., Deeb R.A., Hawley E.L., Hoffmann M.R., Mahendra S.",2016,Environmental Engineering Science,"Several perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been identified as chemicals of concern in the environment due to their persistence, global ubiquity, and classification as reproductive and developmental toxicants, endocrine disrupters, and possible carcinogens. Multiple PFASs are often found together in the environment due to product manufacturing methods and abiotic and biotic transformations. Treatment methods are needed to effectively sequester or destroy a variety of PFASs from groundwater, drinking water, and wastewater. This review presents a comprehensive summary of several categories of treatment approaches: (1) sorption using activated carbon, ion exchange, or other sorbents, (2) advanced oxidation processes, including electrochemical oxidation, photolysis, and photocatalysis, (3) advanced reduction processes using aqueous iodide or dithionite and sulfite, (4) thermal and nonthermal destruction, including incineration, sonochemical degradation, sub-or supercritical treatment, microwave-hydrothermal treatment, and high-voltage electric discharge, (5) microbial treatment, and (6) other treatment processes, including ozonation under alkaline conditions, permanganate oxidation, vitamin-B12 and Ti(III) citrate reductive defluorination, and ball milling. Discussion of each treatment technology, including background, mechanisms, advances, and effectiveness, will inform the development of cost-effective PFAS remediation strategies based on environmental parameters and applicable methodologies. Further optimization of current technologies to analyze and remove or destroy PFASs below regulatory guidelines is needed. Due to the stability of PFASs, a combination of multiple treatment technologies will likely be required to effectively address real-world complexities of PFAS mixtures and cocontaminants present in environmental matrices. © 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",cdestruction; fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH); perfluorinated compounds; perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS); perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA); polyfluorinated compounds; processes; remediation; transformation; treatment,Activated carbon; Ball milling; Carbon; Cost effectiveness; Effluent treatment; Electric discharges; Electrochemical oxidation; Endocrine disrupters; Environmental technology; Groundwater; Incineration; Ion exchange; Oxidation; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Photodegradation; Photolysis; Potable water; Processing; Remediation; Sonochemistry; Wastewater treatment; cdestruction; Fluorotelomer alcohols; Perfluorinated compounds; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; Perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluorinated compounds; transformation; treatment; Activated carbon treatment; activated carbon; alkyl group; chemical compound; citric acid; cyanocobalamin; dithionite; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; potassium iodide; sorbent; sulfite; unclassified drug; water; aqueous solution; Article; defluorination; electrochemical analysis; incineration; ion exchange; microwave radiation; oxidation; photocatalysis; photolysis; reduction; ultraviolet radiation; waste water management,Mary Ann Liebert Inc.
Twenty-five years of endocrine disruption science: Remembering Theo Colborn,"Kwiatkowski C.F., Bolden A.L., Liroff R.A., Rochester J.R., Vandenbergh J.G.",2016,Environmental Health Perspectives,"For nearly 30 years, Dr. Theo Colborn (1927–2014) dedicated herself to studying the harmful effects of endocrine- disrupting chemicals on wildlife, humans, and the environment. More recently, she extended this effort to address the health impacts of unconventional oil and gas development. Colborn was a visionary leader who excelled at synthesizing scientific findings across disciplines. Using her unique insights and strong moral convictions, she changed the face of toxicological research, influenced chemical regulatory policy, and educated the public. In 2003, Colborn started a nonprofit organization— The Endocrine Disruption Exchange (TEDX). As we celebrate the 25th anniversary of endocrine disruption science, TEDX continues her legacy of analyzing the extensive body of environmental health research and developing unique educational resources to support public policy and education. Among other tools, TEDX currently uses the systematic review framework developed by the National Toxicology Program at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, to answer research questions of pressing concern. In this article, we pay homage to the tenacious woman and the exemplary contribution she made to the field of environmental health. Recommendations for the future of the field are drawn from her wisdom. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Synthesis of Nano-catalysts by Induction Suspension Plasma Technology (SPS) for Fischer–Tropsch Reaction,"Aluha J., Bere K., Abatzoglou N., Gitzhofer F.",2016,Plasma Chemistry and Plasma Processing,"Nanometric catalysts were synthesized through induction suspension plasma technology (SPS) for application in the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS). Carbon-supported single metal catalysts (Co/C, Fe/C), bimetallic formulations (Co–Fe/C), and ternary (Co–Fe–Mo and Co–Fe–Ni) systems have been considered in this work. SPS has been selected because it simultaneously allows for: (1) atomizing and generating metallic nanoparticles; (2) creating particularly Fe carbides, which are important in Fe-based FTS reaction mechanism; (3) in situ production of the nanometric graphitic-carbon matrix; and (4) saving time in catalyst synthesis, limiting sample preparation steps and eliminating post synthesis treatment before use. Porosity measurements by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method indicate that the samples are essentially non-porous. The synthesized catalysts characterized by X-ray Diffraction analysis show the presence of both metallic and carbidic species. The graphitic-carbon matrix has substantial structural defects that make it partly amorphous. Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy mapping shows uniform dispersion of the metal moieties in the carbon support.

The relationship between mercury and autism: A comprehensive review and discussion,"Kern J.K., Geier D.A., Sykes L.K., Haley B.E., Geier M.R.",2016,Journal of Trace Elements in Medicine and Biology,"The brain pathology in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) indicates marked and ongoing inflammatory reactivity with concomitant neuronal damage. These findings are suggestive of neuronal insult as a result of external factors, rather than some type of developmental mishap. Various xenobiotics have been suggested as possible causes of this pathology. In a recent review, the top ten environmental compounds suspected of causing autism and learning disabilities were listed and they included: lead, methyl-mercury, polychorinated biphenyls, organophosphate pesticides, organochlorine pesticides, endocrine disruptors, automotive exhaust, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and perfluorinated compounds. This current review, however, will focus specifically on mercury exposure and ASD by conducting a comprehensive literature search of original studies in humans that examine the potential relationship between mercury and ASD, categorizing, summarizing, and discussing the published research that addresses this topic. This review found 91 studies that examine the potential relationship between mercury and ASD from 1999 to February 2016. Of these studies, the vast majority (74%) suggest that mercury is a risk factor for ASD, revealing both direct and indirect effects. The preponderance of the evidence indicates that mercury exposure is causal and/or contributory in ASD. © 2016 The Author(s).",Autism; Autism spectrum disorders (ASD); Human studies; Mercury; Relationship,3 nitrotyrosine; autoantibody; dental amalgam; diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; ethylmercury derivative; hepatitis B vaccine; influenza vaccine; mercuric chloride; mercury; methylmercury; neurokinin A; neurotoxin; porphyrin; rhesus D antibody; thiomersal; xenobiotic agent; mercury; adjuvant therapy; air pollution; autism; body burden; disease severity; environmental exposure; epidemic; government regulation; heme synthesis; human; locus ceruleus; mental disease; mercurialism; nervous system inflammation; neurotoxicity; oxidative stress; prenatal exposure; prevalence; priority journal; Review; toxicokinetics; analysis; Autistic Disorder; complication; metabolism; risk factor; Autistic Disorder; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Mercury; Mercury Poisoning; Risk Factors,Elsevier GmbH
Tunable filter Raman spectroscopy of purified semiconducting and metallic carbon nanotubes,Finnie P.,2016,Nano Research,"Tunable filter Raman spectroscopy is used to efficiently produce Raman excitation maps of unpurified and type-purified single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Maps with fine excitation resolution (1 nm) are created over a wide wavelength range (727 to 980 nm), extending from metallic to semiconducting resonances. At a given wavelength, the wide bandwidth (&gt;3,000 cm–1) allows the comparison of the G band with the radial breathing mode (RBM), and shows the 2D band and other less prominent bands. Materials examined included unsorted powders, aqueous sorted semiconductors, aqueous sorted metals, and polyfluorene sorted semiconductors in toluene. The Raman excitation profiles of the G band are broad, relative to the RBM bands. The maps offer evidence of minority species contamination, except in the case of the polyfluorene sorted semiconductors.

Fatty liver disease induced by perfluorooctane sulfonate: Novel insight from transcriptome analysis,"Fai Tse W.K., Li J.W., Kwan Tse A.C., Chan T.F., Hin Ho J.C., Sun Wu R.S., Chu Wong C.K., Lai K.P.",2016,Chemosphere,"Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a hepato-toxicant and potential non-genotoxic carcinogen, was widely used in industrial and commercial products. Recent studies have revealed the ubiquitous occurrence of PFOS in the environment and in humans worldwide. The widespread contamination of PFOS in human serum raised concerns about its long-term toxic effects and its potential risks to human health. Using fatty liver mutant foie gras (fgr-/-)/transport protein particle complex 11 (trappc11-/-) and PFOS-exposed wild-type zebrafish embryos as the study model, together with RNA sequencing and comparative transcriptomic analysis, we identified 499 and 1414 differential expressed genes (DEGs) in PFOS-exposed wild-type and trappc11 mutant zebrafish, respectively. Also, the gene ontology analysis on common deregulated genes was found to be associated with different metabolic processes such as the carbohydrate metabolic process, glycerol ether metabolic process, mannose biosynthetic process, de novo' (Guanosine diphosphate) GDP-l-fucose biosynthetic process, GDP-mannose metabolic process and galactose metabolic process. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis further highlighted that these deregulated gene clusters are closely related to hepatitis, inflammation, fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver cells, suggesting that PFOS can cause liver pathogenesis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in zebrafish. The transcriptomic alterations revealed may serve as biomarkers for the hepatotoxic effect of PFOS. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Environmental pollutant; Hepatotoxicity; Perfluorooctane sulfonate; Transcriptome; Zebrafish,"Biosynthesis; Genes; Health risks; Metabolism; Pathology; Environmental pollutants; Hepatotoxicity; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Transcriptomes; Zebrafish; Diseases; biological marker; carbohydrate; fat droplet; fucose; galactose; glycerol ether; guanosine diphosphate; guanosine diphosphate mannose; mannose; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; transcriptome; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; messenger RNA; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; carcinogen; cyprinid; digestive system disorder; gene expression; health risk; induced response; metabolism; molecular analysis; public health; serum; sulfonate; toxicity test; Article; biosynthesis; fatty liver; gene cluster; gene expression; gene ontology; hepatomegaly; larva; lipid storage; liver toxicity; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; pathogenesis; RNA sequence; serum; zebra fish; animal; chemically induced; drug effects; fatty liver; gene expression profiling; genetics; hepatitis; human; liver; liver cell; liver cirrhosis; metabolism; nonmammalian embryo; pathology; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Danio rerio; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Fatty Liver; Fluorocarbons; Gene Expression Profiling; Hepatitis; Hepatocytes; Humans; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Zebrafish",Elsevier Ltd
The water vapour continuum in near-infrared windows – Current understanding and prospects for its inclusion in spectroscopic databases,"Shine K.P., Campargue A., Mondelain D., McPheat R.A., Ptashnik I.V., Weidmann D.",2016,Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy,"Spectroscopic catalogues, such as GEISA and HITRAN, do not yet include information on the water vapour continuum that pervades visible, infrared and microwave spectral regions. This is partly because, in some spectral regions, there are rather few laboratory measurements in conditions close to those in the Earth's atmosphere; hence understanding of the characteristics of the continuum absorption is still emerging. This is particularly so in the near-infrared and visible, where there has been renewed interest and activity in recent years. In this paper we present a critical review focusing on recent laboratory measurements in two near-infrared window regions (centred on 4700 and 6300 cm−1) and include reference to the window centred on 2600 cm−1 where more measurements have been reported. The rather few available measurements, have used Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTS), cavity ring down spectroscopy, optical-feedback – cavity enhanced laser spectroscopy and, in very narrow regions, calorimetric interferometry. These systems have different advantages and disadvantages. Fourier Transform Spectroscopy can measure the continuum across both these and neighbouring windows; by contrast, the cavity laser techniques are limited to fewer wavenumbers, but have a much higher inherent sensitivity. The available results present a diverse view of the characteristics of continuum absorption, with differences in continuum strength exceeding a factor of 10 in the cores of these windows. In individual windows, the temperature dependence of the water vapour self-continuum differs significantly in the few sets of measurements that allow an analysis. The available data also indicate that the temperature dependence differs significantly between different near-infrared windows. These pioneering measurements provide an impetus for further measurements. Improvements and/or extensions in existing techniques would aid progress to a full characterisation of the continuum – as an example, we report pilot measurements of the water vapour self-continuum using a supercontinuum laser source coupled to an FTS. Such improvements, as well as additional measurements and analyses in other laboratories, would enable the inclusion of the water vapour continuum in future spectroscopic databases, and therefore allow for a more reliable forward modelling of the radiative properties of the atmosphere. It would also allow a more confident assessment of different theoretical descriptions of the underlying cause or causes of continuum absorption. © 2016 The Author(s)",Absorption continuum; MT_CKD model; Water dimer; Water vapour,Earth atmosphere; Feedback; Infrared devices; Interferometry; Laser spectroscopy; Laser windows; Light measurement; Research laboratories; Spacecraft instruments; Spectroscopy; Temperature distribution; Water vapor; Absorption continuum; Cavity ring down spectroscopies; Fourier transform spectroscopy; Laboratory measurements; Spectroscopic database; Water dimers; Water vapour; Water vapour continuums; Water absorption,Academic Press Inc.
Online monitoring of priority and dangerous pollutants in natural and urban waters: A state-of-the-art review,"Capodaglio A.G., Callegari A., Molognoni D.",2016,Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal,"Purpose – Advancements in real-time water monitoring technologies permit rapid detection of water quality, and threats from waste loads. Water Framework Directive mandating the establishment of Member States’ water resources monitoring, presence of hazardous contaminants in effluents, and perception of vulnerability of water distribution system to attacks, have spurred technical and economic interests. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – As alternative to traditional analyzers, chemosensors, operate according to physical principles, without sample collection (online), and are capable of supplying parameter values continuously and in real-time. Their low selectivity and stability issues have been overcome by technological developments. This review paper contains a comprehensive survey of existing and expected online monitoring technologies for measurement/detection of pollutants in water. Findings – The state-of-the-art in online water monitoring is presented. Application examples are reported. Monitoring costs will become a lesser part of a water utility budget due to the fact that automation and technological simplification will abate human cost factors, and reduce the complexity of laboratory procedures. Originality/value – An overview of applicable instrumentation, and forthcoming developments, is given. Technological development in this field is very rapid, and astonishing advances are anticipated in several areas (fingerprinting, optochemical sensors, biosensors, molecular techniques). Online monitoring is becoming an ever-important tool not only for compliance control or plant management purposes, but also as a useful approach to pollution control and reduction, minimizing the environmental impact of discharges. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Contaminant warning systems; Dangerous; Emerging pollutants; Instrumentation; Liquid and gas chromatography; Online monitoring; Photometry; Priority,,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.
Mechanochemical destruction of halogenated organic pollutants: A critical review,"Cagnetta G., Robertson J., Huang J., Zhang K., Yu G.",2016,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"Many tons of intentionally produced obsolete halogenated persistent organic pollutants (POPs), are stored worldwide in stockpiles, often in an unsafe manner. These are a serious threat to the environment and to human health due to their ability to migrate and accumulate in the biosphere. New technologies, alternatives to combustion, are required to destroy these substances, hopefully to their complete mineralization.In the last 20 years mechanochemical destruction has shown potential to achieve pollutant degradation, both of the pure substances and in contaminated soils. This capability has been tested for many halogenated pollutants, with various reagents, and under different milling conditions. In the present paper, a review of the published work in this field is followed by a critique of the state of the art of POPs mechanochemical destruction and its applicability to full-scale halogenated waste treatment. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Halogenated persistent organic pollutants (POPs); High energy milling; Mechanochemistry; Non-thermal destruction,Halogenation; Health risks; Mechanical alloying; Milling (machining); Pollution; Soil pollution; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Contaminated soils; Mechano-chemistry; Mechanochemicals; Milling conditions; Nonthermal; Persistent organic pollutants; Pollutant degradation; State of the art; Organic pollutants; accumulation; degradation; mechanical property; organohalogen; persistent organic pollutant; pollutant removal; waste treatment; destruction; halogenation; human; pollutant; waste management,Elsevier B.V.
Signaling in a polluted world: Oxidative stress as an overlooked mechanism linking contaminants to animal communication,"Marasco V., Costantini D.",2016,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,"The capacity to communicate effectively with other individuals plays a critical role in the daily life of an individual and can have important fitness consequences. Animals rely on a number of visual and non-visual signals, whose production brings costs to the individual. The theory of honest signaling states that these costs are higher for low than for high-quality individuals, which prevents cheating and makes signals, such as skin and plumage coloration, indicators of individual's quality or condition. The condition-dependent nature of signals makes them ideally suited as indicators of environmental quality, implying that signal production might be affected by contaminants. In this mini-review article, we have made the point that oxidative stress (OS) is one overlooked mechanism linking exposure to contaminants to signaling because (i) many contaminants can influence the individual's oxidative balance, and (ii) generation of both visual and non-visual signals is sensitive to OS. To this end, we have provided the first comprehensive review on the way both non-organic (heavy metals, especially mercury) and organic [persistent organic pollutants (POPs)] contaminants may influence either OS or sexual signaling. We have also paid special attention to emerging classes of pollutants like brominated flame-retardants (BFRs) and perfluoroalkoxy alkanes (PFAs) in order to stimulate research in this area. We have finally provided suggestions and warnings for future work on the links among OS, sexual signaling, and contaminant exposure. © 2016 Marasco and Costantini.",Contaminants; Heavy metals; Honest signals; Hormesis; Oxidative stress; POPs,,Frontiers Media S.

Developmental Exposure to Environmental Chemicals and Metabolic Changes in Children,"Russ K., Howard S.",2016,Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care,"The incidence of childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other forms of metabolic disease have been rising over the past several decades. Although diet and physical activity play important roles in these trends, other environmental factors also may contribute to this significant public health issue. In this article, we discuss the possibility that widespread exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may contribute to the development of metabolic diseases in children. We summarize the epidemiological evidence on exposure to environmental chemicals during early development and metabolic outcomes in infants and children. Prenatal exposure to EDCs, particularly the persistent organic pollutant DDT and its metabolite DDE, may influence growth patterns during infancy and childhood. The altered growth patterns associated with EDCs vary according to exposure level, sex, exposure timing, pubertal status, and age at which growth is measured. Early exposure to air pollutants also is linked to impaired metabolism in infants and children. As a result of these and other studies, professional health provider societies have called for a reduction in environmental chemical exposures. We summarize the resources available to health care providers to counsel patients on how to reduce chemical exposures. We conclude with a discussion of environmental policies that address chemical exposures and ultimately aim to improve public health. © 2016 Mosby, Inc.",,"1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 2,4 dichlorophenol; 2,5 dichlorophenol; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; arsenic; beta hexachlorocyclohexane; chlorphenotane; diethylstilbestrol; endocrine disruptor; environmental chemical; flame retardant; hexachlorobenzene; metal; ozone; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pesticide; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; phthalic acid dibutyl ester; phthalic acid diethyl ester; phthalic acid dimethyl ester; phthalic anhydride; polybrominated biphenyl; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; protocatechuic acid; endocrine disruptor; pollutant; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; child; child development; child growth; childhood obesity; clinical practice; diabetes mellitus; environmental exposure; environmental factor; environmental planning; epigenetics; government regulation; health care policy; human; infancy; insulin resistance; metabolic disorder; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; particulate matter; persistent organic pollutant; prenatal development; prenatal exposure; sex; systematic review (topic); adverse effects; chemically induced; child development; drug effects; environmental exposure; female; genetic epigenesis; pollutant; pregnancy; prevention and control; Child; Child Development; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Health Policy; Humans; Metabolic Diseases; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects",Mosby Inc.
Molecular mechanisms mediating the beneficial metabolic effects of [Arg4]tigerinin-1R in mice with diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance,"Ojo O.O., Srinivasan D.K., Owolabi B.O., McGahon M.K., Moffett R.C., Curtis T.M., Conlon J.M., Flatt P.R., Abdel-Wahab Y.H.A.",2016,Biological Chemistry,"The frog skin host-defense peptide tigerinin-1R stimulates insulin release in vitro and improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in animal models of type 2 diabetes. This study extends these observations by investigating the molecular mechanisms of action underlying the beneficial metabolic effects of the analogue [Arg4]tigerinin-1R in mice with diet-induced obesity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. The study also investigates the electrophysiological effects of the peptide on KATP and L-type Ca2+ channels in BRIN-BD11 clonal β cells. Non-fasting plasma glucose and glucagon concentrations were significantly (p&lt;0.05) decreased and plasma insulin increased by twice daily treatment with [Arg4]tigerinin-1R (75 nmol/kg body weight) for 28 days. Oral and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance were significantly (p&lt;0.05) improved accompanied by enhanced secretion and action of insulin. The peptide blocked KATP channels and, consistent with this, improved beta cell responses of isolated islets to a range of secretagogues. Peptide administration resulted in up-regulation of key functional genes in islets involved insulin secretion (Abcc8, Kcnj11, Cacna1c and Slc2a2) and in skeletal muscle involved with insulin action (Insr, Irs1, Pdk1, Pik3ca, and Slc2a4). These observations encourage further development of tigerinin-1R analogues for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. © 2016 by De Gruyter.",glucose tolerance; insulin release; KATP channels; obesity; tigerinin-1R; type 2 diabetes,"ABC transporter; ABC transporter C8; antidiabetic agent; arginine derivative; beta actin; cacna1c protein; calcium channel L type; glucagon; glucose; glucose transporter 2; glucose transporter 4; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; insulin receptor; insulin receptor substrate 1; inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir6.2; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; peptide derivative; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate 3 kinase; phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1; unclassified drug; voltage gated calcium channel; [arginine 4]tigerinin 1R; amphibian protein; glucose blood level; insulin; tigerinin-1R peptide, Hoplobatrachus rugulosus; animal experiment; animal model; antidiabetic activity; Article; body weight; bone density; bone mineral; caloric intake; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; diet induced obesity; drug effect; drug mechanism; food intake; gene expression; glucagon blood level; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance; insulin blood level; insulin release; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; male; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; oral glucose tolerance test; pancreas islet alpha cell; pancreas islet beta cell; patch clamp technique; priority journal; skeletal muscle; upregulation; whole cell patch clamp; adverse effects; analysis; animal; glucose tolerance test; lipid diet; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; Amphibian Proteins; Animals; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diet, High-Fat; Glucose Tolerance Test; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Male; Mice; Obesity",Walter de Gruyter GmbH
Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals and Reproductive Health,Zlatnik M.G.,2016,Journal of Midwifery and Women's Health,"This review discusses the evidence linking industrial chemicals to a variety of health and reproductive outcomes. Industrial chemical production has increased over the past 30 to 40 years. Basic science, animal models, and epidemiologic data suggest that certain chemicals may act as endocrine disruptors (substances that interfere with normal hormonal action) and may play an etiologic role in a number of conditions whose incidence has also increased during this same period. These include low birth weight, gestational diabetes, obesity, certain cancers, certain birth defects, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit disorder and autism. In addition, some environmental chemicals may have epigenetic effects, resulting in transgenerational health impacts. The epidemiologic and experimental evidence that links chemicals such as plasticizers (eg, phthalates and phenols), flame retardants, perfluorinated compounds, and pesticides with adverse reproductive health outcomes is reviewed. Women's health care providers are the liaison between scientific research and their patients; they should educate themselves on the significance of environmental toxins to health. They are ideally positioned, not only to counsel and reassure pregnant women, but also to suggest practicable changes in dietary and lifestyle habits to improve their health. Furthermore, women's health care providers should advocate for regulatory changes that protect women and their families from the health effects of environmental toxins. © 2016 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives",bisphenol; endocrine disruption; environment; perfluorinated compound; pesticide; phenol; phthalate; polyvinyl chloride; pregnancy; prenatal; toxin,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; endocrine disruptor; environmental chemical; flame retardant; perfluoro compound; pesticide; phenol; phthalic acid; plasticizer; attention deficit disorder; autism; congenital malformation; developmental disorder; environmental health; epigenetics; health care personnel; health impact assessment; human; incidence; lifestyle; low birth weight; neoplasm; neurologic disease; obesity; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnant woman; priority journal; reproductive health; Review",John Wiley and Sons Inc.
Environmental pollutants and child health-A review of recent concerns,"Vrijheid M., Casas M., Gascon M., Valvi D., Nieuwenhuijsen M.",2016,International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health,"In recent years, many new studies have evaluated associations between environmental pollutants and child health. This review aims to provide a broad summary of this literature, comparing the state of epidemiological evidence for the effects of a wide range of environmental contaminants (air pollutants, heavy metals, organochlorine compounds, perfluoroalkyl substances, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, pesticides, phthalates and bisphenol A) on child health outcomes. The review addresses effects on foetal growth and prematurity, neurodevelopment, respiratory and immune health, and childhood growth and obesity. Findings of recent prospective studies and meta-analyses have corroborated previous good evidence, often at lower exposure levels, for effects on foetal growth of air pollution and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), for neurotoxic effects of lead, methylmercury, PCBs and organophosphate pesticides, and for respiratory health effects of air pollution. Moderate evidence has emerged for a potential role of environmental pollutants in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism (lead, PCBs, air pollution), respiratory and immune health (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene - DDE - and PCBs), and obesity (DDE). In addition, there is now moderate evidence that certain chemicals of relatively recent concern may be associated with adverse child health outcomes, specifically perfluorooctanoate and foetal growth, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers and neurodevelopment. For other chemicals of recent concern, such as phthalates and bisphenol A, the literature is characterised by large inconsistencies preventing strong conclusions. In conclusion, since most of the recent literature evaluates common exposures in the general population, and not particularly high exposure situations, this accumulating body of evidence suggests that the unborn and young child require more protection than is currently provided. Large, coordinated research efforts are needed to improve understanding of long-term effects of complex chemical mixtures. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.",Child health; Environmental pollutants; Pregnancy,pollutant; child; child development; child health; drug effects; fetus development; human; immune system; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; obesity; pollutant; Premature Birth; Respiratory Tract Diseases; toxicity; Child; Child Development; Child Health; Environmental Pollutants; Fetal Development; Humans; Immune System; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Obesity; Premature Birth; Respiratory Tract Diseases,Elsevier GmbH
Using GRADE to respond to health questions with different levels of urgency,"Thayer K.A., Schünemann H.J.",2016,Environment International,"Increasing interest exists in applying the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to environmental health evidence. While ideally applied to evidence synthesized in systematic reviews and corresponding summary tables, such as evidence profiles, GRADE's correct application requires that “the evidence that was assessed and the methods that were used to identify and appraise that evidence should be clearly described.” In this article, we suggest that GRADE could be applied to evidence assembled from narrative reviews, modelled (indirect) evidence, or evidence assembled as part of a rapid response, if the underlying judgments about the certainty in this evidence are based on the relevant GRADE domains and provided transparently. Health questions that require assessing the certainty in a body of evidence to provide trustworthy answers may range from hours, to days or weeks, to a few months to scenarios that allow assessing evidence without short-term time pressures. Time frames of emergent, urgent or rapid evidence assessments will often require relying on existing summaries or rapidly compiling the available evidence and making assessments. Even without available full systematic reviews, expressing the certainty in the evidence can provide useful guidance for users of the evidence and those who evaluate certainty in effects. The ratings also help clarifying disagreement between organizations tackling similar questions about the evidence. Using the structured GRADE domains, narrative or other summaries of the evidence can be presented transparently. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,Grading; Environmental health; Rapid response; Short term; Summary tables; Systematic Review; Time frame; Time pressures; Health; melamine; perfluorooctanoic acid; environmental assessment; environmental modeling; risk assessment; Article; decision making; environmental exposure; Grading of Recommendations Assessment; high throughput screening; human; in vitro study; influenza A (H5N1); kidney function; neoplasm; nonhuman; practice guideline; priority journal; risk assessment; structure activity relation; urolithiasis; water contamination; world health organization; epidemiology; evidence based medicine; literature; reproducibility; standards; statistics and numerical data; Epidemiologic Research Design; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Review Literature as Topic,Elsevier Ltd
Organic Contaminants in Chinese Sewage Sludge: A Meta-Analysis of the Literature of the Past 30 Years,"Meng X.-Z., Venkatesan A.K., Ni Y.-L., Steele J.C., Wu L.-L., Bignert A., Bergman A., Halden R.U.",2016,Environmental Science and Technology,"The production of sewage sludge is increasing in China but with unsafe disposal practices, causing potential risk to human health and the environment. Using literature from the past 30 years (N = 159), we conducted a meta-analysis of organic contaminants (OCs) in Chinese sludge. Most data were available from developed and populated regions, and no data were found for Tibet. Since 1987, 35 classes of chemicals consisting of 749 individual compounds and 1 mixture have been analyzed, in which antibiotics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were the most targeted analytes. For 13 classes of principal OCs (defined as chemicals detected in over five studies) in sludge, the median (expressed in nanograms per gram dry weight) was the highest for phthalate esters (27 900), followed by alkylphenol polyethoxylates (12 000), synthetic musks (5800), antibiotics (4240), PAHs (3490), ultraviolet stabilizers (670), bisphenol analogs (160), organochlorine pesticides (110), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (100), pharmaceuticals (84), hormones (69), perfluorinated compounds (21), and polychlorinated biphenyls (15). Concentrations of PAHs in sludges collected between 1998 and 2012 showed a decreasing trend.

"The history, status, gaps, and future directions of neurotoxicology in China","Cai T., Luo W., Ruan D., Wu Y.-J., Fox D.A., Chen J.",2016,Environmental Health Perspectives,"Background: Rapid economic development in China has produced serious ecological, environmental, and health problems. Neurotoxicity has been recognized as a major public health problem. The Chinese government, research institutes, and scientists conducted extensive studies concerning the source, characteristics, and mechanisms of neurotoxicants. Objectives: This paper presents, for the first time, a comprehensive history and review of major sources of neurotoxicants, national bodies/legislation engaged, and major neurotoxicology research in China. Methods: Peer-reviewed research and pollution studies by Chinese scientists from 1991 to 2015 were examined. PubMed, Web of Science and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were the major search tools. Results: The central problem is an increased exposure to neurotoxicants from air and water, food contamination, e-waste recycling, and manufacturing of household products. China formulated an institutional framework and standards system for management of major neurotoxicants. Basic and applied research was initiated, and international cooperation was achieved. The annual number of peer-reviewed neurotoxicology papers from Chinese authors increased almost 30-fold since 2001. Conclusions: Despite extensive efforts, neurotoxicity remains a significant public health problem. This provides great challenges and opportunities. We identified 10 significant areas that require major educational, environmental, governmental, and research efforts, as well as attention to public awareness. For example, there is a need to increase efforts to utilize new in vivo and in vitro models, determine the potential neurotoxicity and mechanisms involved in newly emerging pollutants, and examine the effects and mechanisms of mixtures. In the future, we anticipate working with scientists worldwide to accomplish these goals and eliminate, prevent and treat neurotoxicity. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Similar Microbial Consortia and Genes Are Involved in the Biodegradation of Benzalkonium Chlorides in Different Environments,"Ertekin E., Hatt J.K., Konstantinidis K.T., Tezel U.",2016,Environmental Science and Technology,"Benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) are emerging pollutants. Identification of microorganisms and the genes involved in the biodegradation of BACs is crucial for better understanding the fate of BACs in the environment and developing treatment strategies. Four microbial communities degrading BACs were developed from sewage (SEW), activated sludge (AS), soil (SOIL) and sea sediment (SEA) samples. According to 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and shotgun metagenome sequencing analyses, the most abundant species represented uncharacterized members of the Pseudomonas and Achromobacter genera. BAC biotransformation rates of the enriched microbial communities were 2.8, 3.2, 17.8, and 24.3 μM hr-1 for SEA, AS, SOIL, and SEW, respectively, and were positively correlated with the relative abundance of a particular Pseudomonas sp. strain, BIOMIG1. The strain BIOMIG1 mineralizes BACs at a rate up to 2.40 μmol hr-1 10-11 cells. Genomes of four BAC degrading and nondegrading BIOMIG1 phenotypes were sequenced and differentially compared with each other. As a result, a gene cluster encoding for transporters, an integrase and a dioxygenase were involved in BAC biotransformation. Our results suggest that BIOMIG1 plays a key role on the fate of BACs in the environment and genes, other than those reported to date, are involved in BAC biotransformation in various habitats. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Bacteria; Bioconversion; Chlorine compounds; Gene encoding; Genes; Microorganisms; RNA; Sewage; Soils; Activated sludge; Benzalkonium chloride; Emerging pollutants; Microbial communities; Microbial consortia; Pyrosequencing; Relative abundance; Sequencing analysis; Biodegradation; benzalkonium chloride; dioxygenase; integrase; RNA 16S; benzalkonium; sewage; soil; soil pollutant; abundance; biodegradation; biotransformation; chloride; environmental conditions; gene expression; identification key; microbial activity; microbial community; pollutant removal; relative abundance; Achromobacter; activated sludge; Article; bacterial genome; biodegradation; biotransformation; cell suspension; Comamonas; controlled study; Enterobacter; gene cluster; gene sequence; genetic marker; metagenome; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial consortium; microbial diversity; microbiome; nonhuman; phenotype; phylogenetic tree; protein family; Proteobacteria; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas putida; RNA sequence; sea; Serratia; sewage; soil; Stenotrophomonas; waste water management; bioremediation; chemistry; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; soil pollutant; Achromobacter; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas sp.; Benzalkonium Compounds; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biotransformation; Metagenome; Microbial Consortia; Pseudomonas; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sewage; Soil; Soil Pollutants",American Chemical Society
Fluorinated methacrylamide chitosan hydrogels enhance collagen synthesis in wound healing through increased oxygen availability,"Patil P.S., Fountas-Davis N., Huang H., Michelle Evancho-Chapman M., Fulton J.A., Shriver L.P., Leipzig N.D.",2016,Acta Biomaterialia,"In this study, methacrylamide chitosan modified with perfluorocarbon chains (MACF) is used as the base material to construct hydrogel dressings for treating dermal wounds. MACF hydrogels saturated with oxygen (+O2) are examined for their ability to deliver and sustain oxygen, degrade in a biological environment, and promote wound healing in an animal model. The emerging technique of metabolomics is used to understand how MACF + O2 hydrogel dressings improve wound healing. Results indicate that MACF treatment facilitates oxygen transport rate that is two orders of magnitude greater than base MAC hydrogels. MACF hydrogel dressings are next tested in an in vivo splinted rat excisional wound healing model. Histological analysis reveals that MACF + O2 dressings improve re-epithelialization (p &lt; 0.0001) and synthesis of collagen over controls (p &lt; 0.01). Analysis of endogenous metabolites in the wounds using global metabolomics demonstrates that MACF + O2 dressings promotes a regenerative metabolic process directed toward hydroxyproline and collagen synthesis, with confirmation of metabolite levels within this pathway. The results of this study confirm that increased oxygen delivery through the application of MACF + O2 hydrogels enhances wound healing and metabolomics analyses provides a powerful tool to assess wound healing physiology. Statement of Significance This work presents the first application of a novel class of oxygen delivering biomaterials (methacrylamide chitosan modified with perfluorocarbon chains (MACF)) as a hydrogel wound dressing. This manuscript also contains strong focus on the biochemical benefits of MACF dressings on underlying mechanisms vital to successful wound healing. In this vein, this manuscript presents the application of applied metabolomics (tandem mass spectroscopy) to uncover biomaterial interactions with wound healing mechanisms. We believe the approaches described in this manuscript will be of great interest to biomedical scientists and particularly to researchers studying wound healing, metabolomics, applied biomaterials and regenerative medicine. © 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

"Properties, performance and associated hazards of state-of-the-art durable water repellent (DWR) chemistry for textile finishing","Holmquist H., Schellenberger S., van der Veen I., Peters G.M., Leonards P.E.G., Cousins I.T.",2016,Environment International,"Following the phase-out of long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), the textile industry had to find alternatives for side-chain fluorinated polymer based durable water repellent (DWR) chemistries that incorporated long perfluoroalkyl side chains. This phase-out and subsequent substitution with alternatives has resulted in a market where both fluorinated and non-fluorinated DWRs are available. These DWR alternatives can be divided into four broad groups that reflect their basic chemistry: side-chain fluorinated polymers, silicones, hydrocarbons and other chemistries (includes dendrimer and inorganic nanoparticle chemistries). In this critical review, the alternative DWRs are assessed with regards to their structural properties and connected performance, loss and degradation processes resulting in diffuse environmental emissions, and hazard profiles for selected emitted substances. Our review shows that there are large differences in performance between the alternative DWRs, most importantly the lack of oil repellence of non-fluorinated alternatives. It also shows that for all alternatives, impurities and/or degradation products of the DWR chemistries are diffusively emitted to the environment. Our hazard ranking suggests that hydrocarbon based DWR is the most environmentally benign, followed by silicone and side-chain fluorinated polymer-based DWR chemistries. Industrial commitments to reduce the levels of impurities in silicone based and side-chain fluorinated polymer based DWR formulations will lower the actual risks. There is a lack of information on the hazards associated with DWRs, in particular for the dendrimer and inorganic nanoparticle chemistries, and these data gaps must be filled. Until environmentally safe alternatives, which provide the required performance, are available our recommendation is to choose DWR chemistry on a case-by-case basis, always weighing the benefits connected to increased performance against the risks to the environment and human health. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Dendrimers; Hazard assessment; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances; PFAS; Silicones; Wax,Dendrimers; Fluorine containing polymers; Hazards; Health risks; Hydrocarbons; Nanoparticles; Silicones; Textile finishing; Textile industry; Textiles; Waterproofing; Waxes; Degradation products; Environmental emissions; Environmentally benign; Environmentally safe; Hazard Assessment; Inorganic nanoparticle; PFAS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Degradation; durable water repellent; emulsifying agent; hydrocarbon; polymer; silicone; unclassified drug; dendrimer; fluorocarbon; nanoparticle; pollutant; silicone derivative; hazard assessment; performance assessment; polymer; silicon; textile industry; water chemistry; acute toxicity; adsorption; biodegradation; chronic toxicity; cross linking; ecotoxicity; environmental impact; eutrophication; evaporation; greenhouse effect; health hazard; human; hydrogen bond; hydrophobicity; LC50; leaching; organic chemistry; priority journal; Review; textile finishing; analysis; chemistry; pollutant; product safety; textile; textile industry; Consumer Product Safety; Dendrimers; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbon Polymers; Humans; Hydrocarbons; Nanoparticles; Silicones; Textile Industry; Textiles,Elsevier Ltd
Immobilized metal affinity chromatography on collapsed Langmuir-Blodgett iron(III) stearate films and iron(III) oxide nanoparticles for bottom-up phosphoproteomics,"Gladilovich V., Greifenhagen U., Sukhodolov N., Selyutin A., Singer D., Thieme D., Majovsky P., Shirkin A., Hoehenwarter W., Bonitenko E., Podolskaya E., Frolov A.",2016,Journal of Chromatography A,"Phosphorylation is the enzymatic reaction of site-specific phosphate transfer from energy-rich donors to the side chains of serine, threonine, tyrosine, and histidine residues in proteins. In living cells, reversible phosphorylation underlies a universal mechanism of intracellular signal transduction. In this context, analysis of the phosphoproteome is a prerequisite to better understand the cellular regulatory networks. Conventionally, due to the low contents of signaling proteins, selective enrichment of proteolytic phosphopeptides by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) is performed prior to their LC-MS or -MS/MS analysis. Unfortunately, this technique still suffers from low selectivity and compromised analyte recoveries. To overcome these limitations, we propose IMAC systems comprising stationary phases based on collapsed Langmuir-Blodgett films of iron(III) stearate (FF) or iron(III) oxide nanoparticles (FO) and mobile phases relying on ammonia, piperidine and heptadecafluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Experiments with model phosphopeptides and phosphoprotein tryptic digests showed superior binding capacity, selectivity and recovery for both systems in comparison to the existing commercial analogs. As evidenced by LC-MS/MS analysis of the HeLa phosphoproteome, these features of the phases resulted in increased phosphoproteome coverage in comparison to the analogous commercially available phases, indicating that our IMAC protocol is a promising chromatographic tool for in-depth phosphoproteomic research. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC); Iron oxide; Langmuir-Blodgett films; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Phosphopeptides; Phosphoproteomics,"Affinity chromatography; Amino acids; Chromatography; Iron; Iron oxides; Metal analysis; Metal nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Oxide films; Phosphorylation; Proteins; Signal transduction; Support vector machines; Immobilized metal affinity chromatography; Intracellular signals; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Phosphopeptides; Phosphoproteomics; Reversible phosphorylation; Selective enrichment; Universal mechanisms; Langmuir Blodgett films; iron stearate; phosphopeptide; phosphoprotein; phosphoproteome; proteome; stearic acid; ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide; unclassified drug; ferric ion; iron; nanoparticle; phosphoprotein; stearic acid derivative; analytic method; Article; binding affinity; comparative study; controlled study; female; human; human cell; immobilized metal affinity chromatography; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; priority journal; process optimization; protein analysis; affinity chromatography; chemistry; HeLa cell line; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; procedures; proteomics; Chromatography, Affinity; Ferric Compounds; HeLa Cells; Humans; Iron; Nanoparticles; Phosphoproteins; Proteomics; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Stearates",Elsevier B.V.
A critical review of perfluorooctanoate and perfluorooctanesulfonate exposure and immunological health conditions in humans,"Chang E.T., Adami H.-O., Boffetta P., Wedner H.J., Mandel J.S.",2016,Critical Reviews in Toxicology,"Whether perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), two widely used and biopersistent synthetic chemicals, are immunotoxic in humans is unclear. Accordingly, this article systematically and critically reviews the epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFOA and PFOS and various immune-related health conditions in humans. Twenty-four epidemiologic studies have reported associations of PFOA and/or PFOS with immune-related health conditions, including ten studies of immune biomarker levels or gene expression patterns, ten studies of atopic or allergic disorders, five studies of infectious diseases, four studies of vaccine responses, and five studies of chronic inflammatory or autoimmune conditions (with several studies evaluating multiple endpoints). Asthma, the most commonly studied condition, was evaluated in seven studies. With few, often methodologically limited studies of any particular health condition, generally inconsistent results, and an inability to exclude confounding, bias, or chance as an explanation for observed associations, the available epidemiologic evidence is insufficient to reach a conclusion about a causal relationship between exposure to PFOA and PFOS and any immune-related health condition in humans. When interpreting such studies, an immunodeficiency should not be presumed to exist when there is no evidence of a clinical abnormality. Large, prospective studies with repeated exposure assessment in independent populations are needed to confirm some suggestive associations with certain endpoints. © 2016 Exponent, Inc.

Pharmaceuticals in the environment-Global occurrences and perspectives,"aus der Beek T., Weber F.-A., Bergmann A., Hickmann S., Ebert I., Hein A., Küster A.",2016,Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Pharmaceuticals are known to occur widely in the environment of industrialized countries. In developing countries, more monitoring results have recently become available, but a concise picture of measured environmental concentrations (MECs) is still elusive. Through a comprehensive literature review of 1016 original publications and 150 review articles, the authors collected MECs for human and veterinary pharmaceutical substances reported worldwide in surface water, groundwater, tap/drinking water, manure, soil, and other environmental matrices in a comprehensive database. Due to the heterogeneity of the data sources, a simplified data quality assessment was conducted. The database reveals that pharmaceuticals or their transformation products have been detected in the environment of 71 countries covering all continents. These countries were then grouped into the 5 regions recognized by the United Nations (UN). In total, 631 different pharmaceutical substances were found at MECs above the detection limit of the respective analytical methods employed, revealing distinct regional patterns. Sixteen substances were detected in each of the 5 UN regions. For example, the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac has been detected in environmental matrices in 50 countries, and concentrations found in several locations exceeded predicted no-effect concentrations. Urban wastewater seems to be the dominant emission pathway for pharmaceuticals globally, although emissions from industrial production, hospitals, agriculture, and aquaculture are important locally. The authors conclude that pharmaceuticals are a global challenge calling for multistakeholder approaches to prevent, reduce, and manage their entry into and presence in the environment, such as those being discussed under the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management, a UN Environment Program. © 2015 SETAC © 2016 SETAC.",Emerging pollutant; Global measured environmental concentration database; Measured environmental concentration; Pharmaceutical; Pharmaceutical consumption,"Database systems; Developing countries; Drug products; Fertilizers; Groundwater; Industrial emissions; Matrix algebra; Anti-inflammatory drugs; Emerging pollutants; Environmental concentration; Industrialized countries; Multi-stakeholder approach; Predicted no-effect concentrations; Transformation products; Veterinary pharmaceuticals; Surface waters; acetylsalicylic acid; amoxicillin; azithromycin; carbamazepine; ciprofloxacin; clarithromycin; clofibric acid; diclofenac; drinking water; erythromycin; estradiol; estriol; estrogen; estrone; ethinylestradiol; ground water; ibuprofen; naproxen; norfloxacin; ofloxacin; oral contraceptive agent; paracetamol; pirlimycin; sulfamethoxazole; surface water; tap water; trimethoprim; unindexed drug; vancomycin; veterinary drug; drug; pollutant; waste water; water pollutant; concentration (composition); data quality; database; developing world; drug; emission; environmental assessment; environmental monitoring; global perspective; heterogeneity; literature review; stakeholder; United Nations Environment Program; urban area; wastewater; agriculture; aquaculture; Article; concentration (parameters); data base; developing country; environmental monitoring; geographic distribution; hospital; industrial production; industrialization; limit of detection; priority journal; quality control; sewage; United Nations; urban area; waste water; water contamination; analysis; animal; chemistry; human; pollutant; water pollutant; Agriculture; Animals; Aquaculture; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Hospitals; Humans; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Wiley Blackwell
Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation Versus Reverse Less Invasive Stabilization System-distal Femur for Treating Proximal Femoral Fractures,"Jiang X., Wang Y., Ma X.L., Ma J.X., Wang C., Zhang C.B., Han Z., Sun L., Lu B.",2016,Medicine (United States),"The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of 2 surgical techniques that are used to treat proximal femoral fractures. A systematic literature search (up to December 2014) was conducted in Medline, Embase, PubMed, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to screen for studies comparing proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) with less invasive stabilization system-distal femur (LISS-DF) for proximal femoral fractures. Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies and extracted data. Surgical information and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. A total of 7 studies with 361 patients who satisfied the eligibility criteria included 3 randomized controlled trials and 4 case-controlled trials associated with PFNA versus LISS in treating proximal femoral fractures. Our results demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in hospital stay and time to weight-bearing ambulation and bone healing for PFNA compared with LISS (odds ratio [OR]-1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]-2.92 to-0.05; OR-7.08, 95% CI-8.32 to-5.84; OR-2.71, 95% CI-4.76 to 0.67). No statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups for operative time, blood loss volume, Harris hip score, and incidence of complications. Based on the results of this analysis, we inferred that PFNA is safer and more effective than reverse LISS-DF in patients undergoing osteosynthesis for proximal femoral fractures, and that PFNA is associated with reduced hospital stays and reduced time to weight-bearing ambulation and bone healing. Nonetheless, in certain cases in which PFNA is not suitable due to abnormal structure of the proximal femur or particularly unstable fractures, the LISS plate technique could be a useful alternative. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Remote Control by π-Conjugation of the Emissive Properties of Fischer Carbene-BODIPY Dyads,"Chu G.M., Guerrero-Martínez A., De Arellano C.R., Fernández I., Sierra M.A.",2016,Inorganic Chemistry,"The synthesis, structure, and complete characterization of mono- and bimetallic dyads joining Fischer carbene complexes and BODIPY chromophores are reported. In these organometallic species, the Fischer carbene complex is attached to the BODIPY moiety through a p-aminophenyl group linked at the C8 carbon atom of the BODIPY core. The photophysical properties, namely the corresponding UV/vis absorption and emission spectra of these new metal-carbene complexes, are analyzed and discussed. It is found that whereas the absorption of the considered dyads strongly resembles that of the parent 4-anilinyl-substituted BODIPY, the fluorescence emission is significantly reduced in these species, very likely as a result of a Förster-type energy transfer mechanism. At variance, the replacement of the pentacarbonyl-metal(0) fragment by a carbonyl group leads to high fluorescence emission intensity. In addition, the emissive properties of the BODIPY core in these organometallic dyads can be tuned by remote groups by means of π-conjugation, as supported by density functional theory calculations. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,,American Chemical Society
Occurrence of persistent organic pollutants in sediments and biota from Portugal versus European incidence: A critical overview,"Ribeiro C., Ribeiro A.R., Tiritan M.E.",2016,"Journal of Environmental Science and Health - Part B Pesticides, Food Contaminants, and Agricultural Wastes","Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are widespread compounds, such as organohalogenated compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and pesticides, which can be found in all types of environmental compartments. Their presence in the aquatic environment is a worldwide problem, with emphasis on sediments which act as depository and consequently as a source of hydrophobic, recalcitrant and harmful compounds. Besides, these pollutants might affect the reproduction and mortality of living organisms, diverging in their potential to bioaccumulate in tissues. The present paper aims to review the occurrence of POPs in sediments and biota from the coastal, estuarine and river areas of Portugal. The list of the studied compounds comprises organohalogenated compounds, PAHs, organometallic compounds, pesticides, sterols, fatty acids and pharmaceutical compounds. The contamination of sediments by various pollutants is presented, such as PAHs up to 7,350 ng g−1 found in Sado estuary and polychlorinated biphenyls up to 62.2 ng g−1 in the case of sediments collected in Ria de Aveiro. The occurrence of these persistent toxic substances in sediments demonstrates aquatic contamination from agricultural, industrial and urban discharges and the concern about the potential risks to aquatic organisms, wildlife and humans. In fact, several classes of POPs have also been found in biota, such as polychlorinated biphenyls up to 810.9 ng g−1 in sentinel fish from the Douro River estuary and pesticides in bivalves from the Sado River estuary. The importance of further systematic research on sediments and biota is here highlighted to compare the contamination of these two reservoirs; to assess their spatial and temporal variation; and to determine other classes of POPs that were not investigated yet (e.g., industrial compounds, estrogens and many classes of pharmaceuticals). © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",biota; organohalogenated compounds; Persistent organic pollutants; pesticides; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; sediments,"Aquatic organisms; Aromatic compounds; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Biology; Estuaries; Fatty acids; Hydrocarbons; Industrial research; Organometallics; Pesticides; Pollution; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Rivers; Sediments; biota; Environmental compartment; organohalogenated compounds; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Persistent organic pollutants; Persistent toxic substances; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Spatial and temporal variation; Organic pollutants; bioaccumulation; biota; organohalogen; PAH; persistent organic pollutant; pesticide; sediment pollution; spatial variation; temporal variation; toxicity; Aveiro [Portugal]; Douro Estuary; Porto [Portugal]; Portugal; Ria de Aveiro; Sado Estuary; Setubal [Portugal]; Bivalvia; drug; organic compound; pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; water pollutant; analysis; animal; biota; chemistry; estuary; Europe; fish; meta analysis; Portugal; river; sediment; water pollutant; Animals; Biota; Estuaries; Europe; Fishes; Geologic Sediments; Organic Chemicals; Pesticides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Portugal; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Taylor and Francis Inc.
In utero perfluorooctane sulfonate exposure causes low body weights of fetal rats: A mechanism study,"Li X., Ye L., Ge Y., Yuan K., Zhang Y., Liang Y., Wei J., Zhao C., Lian Q.-Q., Zhu X., Ge R.-S.",2016,Placenta,"Objectives The objective of the present study is to investigate the mechanism of perfluorooctane sulfonate-induced low body weight of fetus by analysis of glucocorticoid metabolizing enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 and gene expression profiling of the placenta after in utero PFOS exposure. Study design Pregnant Sprague-Dawley dams were gavaged with 0, 5, and 20 mg/kg body weight PFOS daily from gestational day 12-18. On gestational day 18, pregnant dams were euthanized, placentas, and fetuses were collected. Main outcome measures Body weights of fetuses and placentas were measured, the corticosterone levels in fetal serum, and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 as well as the placental gene profiling were analyzed. Results 20 mg/kg PFOS significantly reduced fetal body weight and placental weight. Both 5 and 20 mg/kg PFOS increased fetal serum corticosterone levels. PFOS potently inhibited placental 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 activity. Of 21,910 genes, 45 genes were significantly downregulated ≥2 fold by 20 mg/kg PFOS, including extracellular matrix (Slpi and Pi16), growth factors and hormones (Trh and Pdf), ion transporters (Aqp1, S100a4, and Abp1), signal transducers (Kap and Ampd3), and structural constituents (A2m and Des).

The diagnostic yield of transesophageal echocardiography in patients with cryptogenic cerebral ischaemia: A meta-analysis,"Katsanos A.H., Giannopoulos S., Frogoudaki A., Vrettou A.-R., Ikonomidis I., Paraskevaidis I., Zompola C., Vadikolias K., Boviatsis E., Parissis J., Voumvourakis K., Kyritsis A.P., Tsivgoulis G.",2016,European Journal of Neurology,"Background and purpose: The diagnostic utility of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in patients with cryptogenic ischaemic stroke (IS) or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) remains controversial. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA guidelines to estimate the pooled prevalence of potential cardioembolic causes detected by TEE in prospective observational studies of cryptogenic IS/TIA. Cardiac conditions causally associated with cerebral ischaemia were considered to be intramural thrombi and intracardiac tumors according to ASCO phenotyping of IS. Results: Thirty-five eligible studies, comprising 5772 patients (mean age 53.6 years, 56.9% men) were identified. The most common TEE finding was ascending aorta and/or aortic arch atheroma [51.2% (27.4%-74.5%)], followed by patent foramen ovale (PFO) [43.2% (36.3%-50.4%)]. Complex aortic plaques and large PFOs were reported in 14% (10.2%-18.9%) and 19.5% (16.6%-22.8%) of TEE evaluations. The prevalence of atrial septal aneurysm was 12.3% (7.9%-18.7%) and was significantly higher in conjunction with PFO presence (risk ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.63-2.54, P &lt; 0.001). The prevalence of left atrial thrombus [3.0% (1.1%-8.3%)] and spontaneous echo contrast [3.8% (2.3%-6.2%)] was low. The prevalence of intracardiac tumors was extremely uncommon [0.2% (0%-0.7%)]. Significant heterogeneity was identified (I2 &gt; 60%) in the majority of analyses. Heterogeneity was not affected by cryptogenic stroke definition (TOAST versus alternative criteria). After dichotomizing available studies using a cut-off of 50 years, PFO was significantly (P = 0.001) more prevalent in younger than in older patients. Conclusion: Routine TEE in patients with cryptogenic IS/TIA commonly identifies abnormal findings. However, the prevalence of cardiac conditions considered to be causally associated with cerebral ischaemia (intracardiac thrombi and tumors) is low. © 2016 European Academy of Neurology.",Cryptogenic; Stroke; Transesophageal echocardiography; Transient ischaemic attack,"adult; aorta atherosclerosis; aortic arch atheroma; Article; ascending aorta; atrial septal aneurysm; brain ischemia; cardiovascular system examination; cerebrovascular accident; diagnostic value; endocarditis; female; heart atrium thrombosis; heart disease; heart tumor; human; major clinical study; male; patent foramen ovale; practice guideline; priority journal; transesophageal echocardiography; transient ischemic attack; brain ischemia; complication; Heart Diseases; Ischemic Attack, Transient; meta analysis; middle aged; statistics and numerical data; Stroke; transesophageal echocardiography; Brain Ischemia; Echocardiography, Transesophageal; Female; Heart Diseases; Humans; Ischemic Attack, Transient; Male; Middle Aged; Stroke",Blackwell Publishing Ltd
Meta-analysis of the laparoscopic versus open colorectal surgery within fast track surgery,"Zhao J.-H., Sun J.-X., Huang X.-Z., Gao P., Chen X.-W., Song Y.-X., Liu J., Cai C.-Z., Xu H.-M., Wang Z.-N.",2016,International Journal of Colorectal Disease,"Background: Laparoscopic methods and fast-track surgery (FTS) can enhance recovery and reduce postoperative hospital stay. However, whether laparoscopic surgery can provide short-term benefits within FTS is controversial. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of published studies to evaluate the effect of laparoscopic colorectal surgery within FTS. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Ovid databases for eligible studies. Endpoints were duration of postoperative hospital stay, time to first bowel movement, total postoperative complication rate, readmission rate, mortality within 30 days after surgery, and conversation rate of laparoscopic surgery. Results: Four randomized controlled trials and six clinical controlled trials (1510 patients) were eligible for analyses. Duration of postoperative hospital stay (weighted mean difference, –1.65 days; p < 0.001), time to first bowel movement (–1.13 days; p < 0.001), total postoperative complication rate (risk ratio [RR], 0.65; p < 0.001), readmission rate (0.46; p < 0.001), and mortality (0.45; p < 0.001) were significantly reduced in the laparoscopic surgery group. Overall conversion rate of laparoscopic surgery was 11.1 %. Subgroup analyses based on each FT element demonstrated that studies without the element “prevention of hypothermia,” “no bowel preparation,” or “no routine use of drains” did not show significant differences between two groups with regard to duration of postoperative hospital stay or total prevalence of postoperative complications. Conclusion: Within FTS, laparoscopic methods can significantly shorten postoperative hospital stay, accelerate postoperative recovery, and enhance safety in colorectal surgery. The FT elements “prevention of hypothermia,” “no bowel preparation,” and “no routine use of drains” may play important parts in the combined effect of these two methods. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Colorectal surgery; Fast track surgery; Laparoscopic surgery,"Article; colorectal surgery; comparative effectiveness; controlled clinical trial (topic); defecation; fast track surgery; hospital readmission; human; hypothermia; laparoscopic surgery; length of stay; meta analysis; patient safety; postoperative complication; postoperative period; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); surgery; surgical mortality; treatment outcome; adverse effects; aged; comparative study; laparoscopy; middle aged; mortality; Postoperative Complications; risk factor; time factor; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colorectal Surgery; Defecation; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Middle Aged; Patient Readmission; Postoperative Complications; Risk Factors; Time Factors",Springer Verlag
Sister Dehalobacter genomes reveal specialization in organohalide respiration and recent strain differentiation likely driven by chlorinated substrates,"Tang S., Wang P.H., Higgins S.A., Löffler F.E., Edwards E.A.",2016,Frontiers in Microbiology,"The genomes of two closely related Dehalobacter strains (strain CF and strain DCA) were assembled from the metagenome of an anaerobic enrichment culture that reductively dechlorinates chloroform (CF), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA) and 1,1-dichloroethane (1,1-DCA). The 3.1 Mbp genomes of strain CF (that dechlorinates CF and 1,1,1-TCA) and strain DCA (that dechlorinates 1,1-DCA) each contain 17 putative reductive dehalogenase homologous (rdh) genes. These two genomes were systematically compared to three other available organohalide-respiring Dehalobacter genomes (Dehalobacter restrictus strain PER-K23, Dehalobacter sp. strain E1 and Dehalobacter sp. strain UNSWDHB), and to the genomes of Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 195 and Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain Y51. This analysis compared 42 different metabolic and physiological categories. The genomes of strains CF and DCA share 90% overall average nucleotide identity and > 99.8% identity over a 2.9 Mbp alignment that excludes large insertions, indicating that these genomes differentiated from a close common ancestor. This differentiation was likely driven by selection pressures around two orthologous reductive dehalogenase genes, cfrA and dcrA, that code for the enzymes that reduce CF or 1,1,1-TCA and 1,1-DCA. The many reductive dehalogenase genes found in the five Dehalobacter genomes cluster into two small conserved regions and were often associated with Crp/Fnr transcriptional regulators. Specialization is on-going on a strain-specific basis, as some strains but not others have lost essential genes in the Wood-Ljungdahl (strain E1) and corrinoid biosynthesis pathways (strains E1 and PER-K23). The gene encoding phosphoserine phosphatase, which catalyzes the last step of serine biosynthesis, is missing from all five Dehalobacter genomes, yet D. restrictus can grow without serine, suggesting an alternative or unrecognized biosynthesis route exists. In contrast to D. mccartyi, a complete heme biosynthesis pathway is present in the five Dehalobacter genomes. This pathway corresponds to a newly described alternative heme biosynthesis route first identified in Archaea.

The role of complement activation in atherogenesis: the first 40 years,"Vlaicu S.I., Tatomir A., Rus V., Mekala A.P., Mircea P.A., Niculescu F., Rus H.",2016,Immunologic Research,"The pathogenesis of atherosclerotic inflammation is a multi-step process defined by the interweaving of excess modified lipid particles, monocyte-macrophages populations, and innate immune and adaptive immunity effectors. A part of innate immunity, the complement system, is an important player in the induction and progression of atherosclerosis. The accumulation of either oxidized or enzymatically modified LDL—bound to C-reactive protein or not—prompts complement activation leading to the assembly of the terminal complement C5b-9 complex in the atherosclerotic lesion. The sublytic C5b-9 assembly leads to the activation and proliferation of smooth muscle and endothelial cells, accompanied by the release of various chemotactic, pro-adhesion, and procoagulant cytokines from these cells. Response gene to complement (RGC)-32, an essential effector of the terminal complement complex C5b-9, also affects atherogenesis, propelling vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, stimulating endothelial proliferation, and promoting vascular lesion formation. A substantial amount of experimental work has suggested a role for the complement system activation during atherosclerotic plaque formation, with the proximal classical complement pathway seemingly having a protective effect and terminal complement contributing to accelerated atherogenesis. All these data suggest that complement plays an important role in atherogenesis. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Atherosclerosis; C5b-9 complement complex; Complement activation; Endothelial cells; RGC-32; Smooth muscle cells,"C reactive protein; CD11b antigen; CD59 antigen; clusterin; complement; complement 32; complement component C3; complement component C3b receptor; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement factor H; complement inhibitor; complement membrane attack complex; decay accelerating factor; immunoglobulin; pexelizumab; unclassified drug; vitronectin; cell cycle protein; complement; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; muscle protein; nerve protein; RGC32 protein, human; atherogenesis; cell proliferation; complement activation; endothelium cell; gene; gene expression; gene function; human; immune response; immunohistochemistry; innate immunity; meta analysis (topic); nonhuman; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; protein localization; protein protein interaction; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; RGC 32 gene; signal transduction; smooth muscle fiber; animal; atherosclerosis; genetics; immunology; metabolism; physiology; vascular smooth muscle; Animals; Atherosclerosis; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Proliferation; Cholesterol, LDL; Complement Activation; Complement System Proteins; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Muscle Proteins; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular; Nerve Tissue Proteins",Humana Press Inc.
Research Review: Executive function deficits in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder – a meta-analysis,"Kingdon D., Cardoso C., McGrath J.J.",2016,Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines,"Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like symptoms are common in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). FASD and ADHD groups both display executive function impairments; however, there is ongoing debate whether the pattern and magnitude of executive function deficits differs between these two types of disorders. Methods: An electronic literature search was conducted (PubMed, PsychInfo; 1972–2013) to identify studies comparing the executive functioning of children with FASD with ADHD or control groups. FASD groups included those with and without dysmorphy (i.e., FAS, pFAS, ARND, and other FASD diagnoses). Effect sizes (Hedges' g, standardized mean difference) were calculated. Random effects meta-analytic models were performed using the metafor package for R. Results: Fifty-one studies met inclusion criteria (FASD N = 2,115; ADHD N = 453; controls N = 1,990). Children with FASD showed the strongest and most consistent deficits in planning, fluency, and set-shifting compared to controls (Hedges' g = −0.94, −0.78) and children with ADHD (Hedges' g = −0.72, −0.32). FASD was associated with moderate to large impairments in working memory, compared to controls (Hedges' g = -.84, -.58) and small impairments relative to groups with ADHD (Hedges' g = -.26). Smaller and less consistent deficits were found on measures of inhibition and vigilance relative to controls (Hedges' g = −0.52, −0.31); FASD and ADHD were not differentiated on these measures. Moderator analyses indicated executive dysfunction was associated with older age, dysmorphy, and larger group differences in IQ. Sex and diagnostic system were not consistently related to effect size. Conclusions: While FASD is associated with global executive impairments, executive function weaknesses are most consistent for measures of planning, fluency, and set-shifting. Neuropsychological measures assessing these executive function domains may improve differential diagnosis and treatment of FASD. © 2015 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.",attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; executive function; Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders; meta-analysis; neuropsychology,attention deficit disorder; executive function; fetal alcohol syndrome; human; meta analysis; pathophysiology; physiology; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Executive Function; Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders; Humans,Blackwell Publishing Ltd
"Meta-analysis of lipid-traits in Hispanics identifies novel loci, population-specific effects, and tissue-specific enrichment of eQTLs","Below J.E., Parra E.J., Gamazon E.R., Torres J., Krithika S., Candille S., Lu Y., Manichakul A., Peralta-Romero J., Duan Q., Li Y., Morris A.P., Gottesman O., Bottinger E., Wang X.-Q., Taylor K.D., Ida Chen Y.-D., Rotter J.I., Rich S.S., Loos R.J.F., Tang H., Cox N.J., Cruz M., Hanis C.L., Valladares-Salgado A.",2016,Scientific Reports,"We performed genome-wide meta-analysis of lipid traits on three samples of Mexican and Mexican American ancestry comprising 4,383 individuals, and followed up significant and highly suggestive associations in three additional Hispanic samples comprising 7,876 individuals. Genome-wide significant signals were observed in or near CELSR2, ZNF259/APOA5, KANK2/DOCK6 and NCAN/MAU2 for total cholesterol, LPL, ABCA1, ZNF259/APOA5, LIPC and CETP for HDL cholesterol, CELSR2, APOB and NCAN/MAU2 for LDL cholesterol, and GCKR, TRIB1, ZNF259/APOA5 and NCAN/MAU2 for triglycerides. Linkage disequilibrium and conditional analyses indicate that signals observed at ABCA1 and LIPC for HDL cholesterol and NCAN/MAU2 for triglycerides are independent of previously reported lead SNP associations. Analyses of lead SNPs from the European Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC) dataset in our Hispanic samples show remarkable concordance of direction of effects as well as strong correlation in effect sizes. A meta-analysis of the European GLGC and our Hispanic datasets identified five novel regions reaching genome-wide significance: two for total cholesterol (FN1 and SAMM50), two for HDL cholesterol (LOC100996634 and COPB1) and one for LDL cholesterol (LINC00324/CTC1/PFAS). The top meta-analysis signals were found to be enriched for SNPs associated with gene expression in a tissue-specific fashion, suggesting an enrichment of tissue-specific function in lipid-associated loci.",,"lipid; antibody specificity; blood; Caucasian; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic association study; genetics; genome-wide association study; genotype; Hispanic; human; lipid metabolism; meta analysis; Mexico; population genetics; quantitative trait; quantitative trait locus; single nucleotide polymorphism; European Continental Ancestry Group; Genetic Association Studies; Genetics, Population; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Linkage Disequilibrium; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Mexico; Organ Specificity; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Quantitative Trait, Heritable",Nature Publishing Group
"Maestro, Marguerite, morphine: The last years in the life of Mikhail Bulgakov","Zilberstein G., Maor U., Baskin E., Righetti P.G.",2016,Journal of Proteomics,"The manuscript pages of the final draft of Master i Margarita, the masterpiece by Mikhail Bulgakov, written in the last four years of his life (1936-1940), have been treated with a mixture of chromatographic beads, namely a strong cation exchanger and a C8 resin. Potential substances captured by the beads, after harvesting them, were eluted with a mixture of isopropyl alcohol, dichloromethane and ammonium hydroxide and the eluate subjected to GC-MS analysis in order to detect the presence, if any, of drugs, due to the fact that the writer suffered intense pains caused by an inherited nephrotic syndrome. Indeed all the pages under investigation (a total of ten, taken at random among 127 foils) contained traces of morphine, from as little as 5 up to 100ng/cm2. In addition to the intact drug, we could detect one of its metabolites, namely 6-O-acetyl morphine. The significance of these findings in terms of a possible improvement of the novel and in terms of drug use (or abuse) in the modern world is discussed and evaluated. Biological significance: The extraction of metabolites/proteins from the surface of the original manuscript pages of Bulgakov masterpiece Master i Margarita has permitted to monitor his health state and intake of medicaments over the last four years of his life. We have ascertained that: (1) he was assuming large doses of morphine as pain killers; (2) he was affected by a nephrotic syndrome, since we could identify three proteins known as biomarkers of this pathology. The double extraction procedure here reported could open up a novel field of investigation of (relatively) ancient manuscripts for metabolome/proteome analysis on the health status of the writer/artist. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",6-O-acetyl morphine; Bulgakov manuscript; Chromatographic resins; Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; Master i Margarita; Morphine,"6 o acetyl morphine; morphine; unclassified drug; morphine; Article; cation exchange; drug abuse; health status; mass fragmentography; metabolomics; nephrotic syndrome; priority journal; proteomics; publication; writing; art; book; history; human; morphine addiction; paper; publication; Russian Federation; young adult; Books; History, 20th Century; Humans; Manuscripts as Topic; Morphine; Morphine Dependence; Paper; Russia; Young Adult",Elsevier
Production of medium-chain carboxylic acids by Megasphaera sp. MH with supplemental electron acceptors,"Jeon B.S., Choi O., Um Y., Sang B.-I.",2016,Biotechnology for Biofuels,"Background: C5-C8 medium-chain carboxylic acids are valuable chemicals as the precursors of various chemicals and transport fuels. However, only a few strict anaerobes have been discovered to produce them and their production is limited to low concentrations because of product toxicity. Therefore, a bacterial strain capable of producing high-titer C5-C8 carboxylic acids was strategically isolated and characterized for production of medium chain length carboxylic acids. Results: Hexanoic acid-producing anaerobes were isolated from the inner surface of a cattle rumen sample. One of the isolates, displaying the highest hexanoic acid production, was identified as Megasphaera sp. MH according to 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Megasphaera sp. MH metabolizes fructose and produces various medium-chain carboxylic acids, including hexanoic acid, in low concentrations. The addition of acetate to the fructose medium as an electron acceptor increased hexanoic acid production as well as cell growth. Supplementation of propionate and butyrate into the medium also enhanced the production of C5-C8 medium-chain carboxylic acids. Megasphaera sp. MH produced 5.7 g L-1 of pentanoic acid (C5), 9.7 g L-1 of hexanoic acid (C6), 3.2 g L-1 of heptanoic acid (C7) and 1.2 g L-1 of octanoic acid (C8) in medium supplemented with C2-C6 carboxylic acids as the electron acceptors. This is the first report on the production of high-titer heptanoic acid and octanoic acid using a pure anaerobic culture. Conclusion: Megasphaera sp. MH metabolized fructose for the production of C2-C8 carbon-chain carboxylic acids using various electron acceptors and achieved a high-titer of 9.7 g L-1 and fast productivity of 0.41 g L-1 h-1 for hexanoic acid. However, further metabolic activities of Megaspahera sp. MH for C5-C8 carboxylic acids production must be deciphered and improved for industrially relevant production levels. © 2016 The Author(s).",Fermentation; Heptanoic acid; Hexanoic acid; Megasphaera sp.

Advanced nanocomposite membranes for fuel cell applications: A comprehensive review,"Pourzare K., Mansourpanah Y., Farhadi S.",2016,Biofuel Research Journal,"Combination of inorganic fillers into organic polymer membranes (organic-inorganic hybrid membranes) has drawn a significant deal of attention over the last few decades. This is because of the incorporated influence of the organic and inorganic phases towards proton conductivity and membrane stability, in addition to cost decline, improved water retention property, and also suppressing fuel crossover by increasing the transport pathway tortuousness. The preparation methods of the composite membranes and the intrinsic characteristics of the used particles as filler, such as size, type, surface acidity, shape, and their interactions with the polymer matrix can significantly affect the properties of the resultant matrix. The membranes currently used in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are perfluorinated polymers containing sulfonic acid, such as Nafion®. Although these membranes possess superior properties, such as high proton conductivity and acceptable chemical, mechanical, and thermal stability, they suffer from several disadvantages such as water management, CO poisoning, and fuel crossover. Organic-inorganic nanocomposite PEMs offer excellent potentials for overcoming these shortcomings in order to achieve improved FC performance. Various inorganic fillers for the fabrication of composite membranes have been comprehensively reviewed in the present article. Moreover, the properties of polymer composites containing different nanoparticles have been thoroughly discussed. © 2016 BRTeam.",Fuel cell; Inorganic fillers; Organic-inorganic nanocomposite; Proton exchange membrane,Chemical stability; Filled polymers; Fillers; Nanocomposites; organic-inorganic materials; Polymer matrix composites; Proton conductivity; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Fuel cell application; Fuel crossover; Inorganic-fillers; Nano-composite membranes; Organic-inorganic hybrid membranes; Organic-inorganic nanocomposites; Organic/inorganic nano-composite; Polymer membrane; Property; Proton exchange membranes; Composite membranes,Green Wave Publishing of Canada
InterTan nail versus proximal femoral nail antirotation for femoral intertrochanteric fractures: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Hu B.-Y., Ai J.-W., Chen Q., Yao Z.-J.",2016,Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research,"BACKGROUND: The conclusion of current studies about the difference of clinical efficacy between Inter Tan nail and proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) for femoral intertrochanteric fractures is still controversial. OBJECTIVE: To compare the difference in therapeutic efficacy between Inter Tan nail and PFNA for femoral intertro chanteric fractures using systematical review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A computer-based online search was conducted in Pub Med, The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2016), Embase, CNKI, VIP, CBM, and Wan-Fang databases up to May 8, 2016 to screen the relevant controlled trials of InterTan nail versus PFNA for the treatment of femoral intertrochanteric fractures. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted information, and assessed the quality of included trials. Data extraction from eligible studies was pooled and meta-analyzed using Stata13.1 software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 8 randomized and 8 non-randomized trials involving 1 323 patients were included. There were 658 patients undergoing InterTan nail and 665 patients undergoing PFNA. The meta-analysis results showed that there were no significant differences in excellent rate, intraoperative blood loss, bedridden time, and fracture healing time (P > 0.05). The operative time in InterTan nail group was longer than PFNA group [MD=11.51 , 95%CI(6.41_11.62), P < 0.01]. However, the InterTan nail was superior to PFNA in increasing the Harris scores [MD=1.38, 95%CI(0.25, 2.51), P=0.02], and decreasing the complication rates [RR=0.54, 95%CI(0.44, 0.67), P < 0.01]. Due to the limitations of the included studies, more high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to verify the above conclusion. In addition, future studies should focus on the difference in therapeutic efficacy of the two treatments in different fracture types and the osteoporosis patients. © 2016, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

The epidemiologic evidence linking prenatal and postnatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals with male reproductive disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Bonde J.P., Flachs E.M., Rimborg S., Glazer C.H., Giwercman A., Ramlau-Hansen C.H., Hougaard K.S., Høyer B.B., Hærvig K.K., Petersen S.B., Rylander L., Specht I.O., Toft G., Bräuner E.V.",2016,Human Reproduction Update,"BACKGROUND: More than 20 years ago, it was hypothesized that exposure to prenatal and early postnatal environmental xenobiotics with the potential to disrupt endogenous hormone signaling might be on the causal path to cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low sperm count and testicular cancer. Several consensus statements and narrative reviews in recent years have divided the scientific community and have elicited a call for systematic transparent reviews. We aimed to fill this gap in knowledge in the field of male reproductive disorders. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The aim of this study was to systematically synthesize published data on the risk of cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low sperm counts and testicular cancer following in utero or infant exposure to chemicals that have been included on the European Commission's list of Category 1 endocrine disrupting chemicals defined as having documented adverse effects due to endocrine disruption in at least one intact organism. SEARCH METHODS: A systematic literature search for original peer reviewed papers was performed in the databases PubMed and Embase to identify epidemiological studies reporting associations between the outcomes of interest and exposures documented by biochemical analyses of biospecimens including maternal blood or urine, placenta or fat tissue as well as amnion fluid, cord blood or breast milk; this was followed by meta-analysis of quantitative data. OUTCOMES: The literature search resulted in 1314 references among which we identified 33 papers(28 study populations) fulfilling the eligibility criteria. These provided 85 risk estimates of links between persistent organic pollutants and rapidly metabolized compounds (phthalates and Bisphenol A) and male reproductive disorders. The overall odds ratio (OR) across all exposures and outcomes was 1.11 (95% CI 0.91-1.35). When assessing four specific chemical subgroups with sufficient data for meta-analysis for all outcomes, we found that exposure to one of the four compounds, p,p'-DDE, was related to an elevated risk: OR 1.35 (95% CI 1.04-1.74). The data did not indicate that this increased risk was driven by any specific disorder. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The current epidemiological evidence is compatible with a small increased risk of male reproductive disorders following prenatal and postnatal exposure to some persistent environmental chemicals classified as endocrine disruptors but the evidence is limited. Future epidemiological studies may change the weight of the evidence in either direction. No evidence of distortion due to publication bias was found, but exposure-response relationships are not evident. There are insufficient data on rapidly metabolized endocrine disruptors and on specific exposure-outcome relations. A particular data gap is evident with respect to delayed effects on semen quality and testicular cancer. Although high quality epidemiological studies are still sparse, future systematic and transparent reviews may provide pieces of evidence contributing to the narrative and weight of the evidence assessments in the field. © The Author 2016.",Cryptorchidism; Endocrine disruption; Hypospadias; Infertility; Prenatal exposure; Sperm count; Testicular cancer; Xenobiotics,"1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 1,1,1 trichloro 2 (2 chlorophenyl) 2 (4 chlorophenyl)ethane; 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; beta hexachlorocyclohexane; chlordane; chlorphenotane; di (2 ethylhexyl)phthalate; dieldrin; endocrine disruptor; heptachlor epoxide; hexachlorobenzene; mirex; mono (2 ethylhexyl)phthalate; mono n butyl phthalate; nonylphenol; octylphenol; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; phthalic acid; phthalic acid dibutyl ester; polybrominated biphenyl; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; unclassified drug; endocrine disruptor; xenobiotic agent; adipose tissue; amnion fluid; Article; biochemical analysis; blood analysis; breast milk; cryptorchism; human; hypospadias; male; maternal blood; meta analysis; odds ratio; persistent organic pollutant; placenta; postnatal exposure; prenatal exposure; priority journal; risk assessment; spermatozoon count; systematic review; testis cancer; umbilical cord blood; urinalysis; adverse effects; chemically induced; cryptorchism; environmental exposure; epidemiology; female; hypospadias; neoplasm; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; risk factor; semen analysis; testis tumor; Cryptorchidism; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Hypospadias; Male; Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Risk Factors; Semen Analysis; Testicular Neoplasms; Xenobiotics",Oxford University Press
The Effect of Biomaterials Used for Tissue Regeneration Purposes on Polarization of Macrophages,"Boersema G.S.A., Grotenhuis N., Bayon Y., Lange J.F., Bastiaansen-Jenniskens Y.M.",2016,BioResearch Open Access,"Activation of macrophages is critical in the acute phase of wound healing after implantation of surgical biomaterials. To understand the response of macrophages, they are often cultured in vitro on biomaterials. Since a wide range of biomaterials is currently used in the clinics, we undertook a systematic review of the macrophage polarization in response to these different surgical biomaterials in vitro. Beside the chemistry, material characteristics such as dimension, pore size, and surface topography are of great influence on the response of macrophages. The macrophage response also appears to depend on the differences in sterilization techniques that induce lasting biochemical changes or residues of chemicals and their byproducts used for sterilization. Regarding tissue-based biomaterials, macrophages on human or porcine dermis, strongly cross-linked by chemicals elicit in general a proinflammatory response with higher amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. Synthetic biomaterials such as polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) + polyacrylamide (PAAm), PET + sodium salt of poly(acrylic acid) (PAANa), perfluoropolyether (PFPE) with large posts, PEG-g-PA, and polydioxanone (PDO) always appear to elicit an anti-inflammatory response in macrophages, irrespective of origin of the macrophages, for example, buffy coats or full blood. In conclusion, in general in vitro models contribute to evaluate the foreign body reaction on surgical biomaterials. Although it is difficult to simulate complexity of host response elicited by biomaterials, after their surgical implantation, an in vitro model gives indications of the initial foreign body response and allows the comparison of this response between biomaterials. © Geesien S.A.

Is proximal femoral nail antirotation superior to gamma nail and dynamic hip screw in treatment of intertrochanteric fractures? A pairwise and network meta-analysis,"Yin S., Dai X., Zhang D., Du H.",2016,International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine,"Proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) was theoretically designed to be an ideal intramedullary device for the fixation of intertrochanteric fractures by providing angular and rotational stability. We investigated when compared with Gamma nail (GN) and dynamic hip screw (DHS) whether PFNA was associated with (1) a lower incidence of reoperation, mortality and fixation failures, (2) a lower risk of major complications (wound infection and thromboembolism), (3) less operative blood loss, shorter surgical time, operative fluoroscopy time and hospital stay. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search in MEDLINE®, EMBASE, OVID and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and identified 753 papers. Of these, identified 13 randomized controlled trials comparing two (or more) common internal fixation devices (among PFNA, GN and DHS) in treatment of Intertrochanteric fractures. We performed both traditional direct-comparison meta-analysis and network meta-analysis. The strength of evidence was evaluated by using GRADE profiler software. Results: Direct-comparison meta-analysis demonstrated PFNA was associated with less operative blood loss when compared with GN (95% CI, -93.56 to -5.44, low confidence evidence) and DHS (95% CI, -291.90 to -151.58, low confidence evidence), and less operative fluoroscopy time when compared with GN (95% CI, -56.21 to -3.79, low confidence evidence). Network meta-analysis only found that PFNA was associated with less operative blood loss when compared with DHS (95% CI, -342.12 to -81.94) with very low confidence evidence. Conclusions: Current published evidence does not support the superiority of PFNA to other fixation strategies for intertrochanteric fractures. Although use of PFNA may be advantageous in reducing the operative blood loss and fluoroscopy time when compared with GN and DHS, the conclusion was limited and unacceptable because of the relatively low quality of evidences with either low or very low strength of confidence. © 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

Occurrence of contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) in conventional and non-conventional water resources in Tunisia,"Fries E., Mahjoub O., Mahjoub B., Berrehouc A., Lions J., Bahadir M.",2016,Fresenius Environmental Bulletin,"Contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) include a wide variety of compounds like pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and their metabolites. In developing countries, CEC are gaining interest as they are contaminating the water resources. In Tunisia, for the first time, a total of 25 PPCPs and three of their metabolites were analysed in wastewater, reclaimed water, surface water and groundwater. Most of selected CEC were detected not only in raw wastewater, but also in treated wastewater and reclaimed water. High contents of Cl and Na in wastewater and reclaimed water were an indication of industrial discharge. PPCPs were detected in surface water from the Meliane River; the highest concentrations were measured close to the estuary to the Mediterranean Sea. High concentrations of 2-OH-ibuprofene in the Meliane River downstream a wastewater treatment plant might result from the biodegradation of ibuprofen during secondary wastewater treatment. Based on their levels of concentration, it is proposed to use carbamazepine, caffeine, ibuprofene, atenolol, fenofibric acid, methylparabene, bisphenol A, and 2-OH-ibuprofene as indicators of wastewater-derived pollution of surface water resources in Tunisia. Salinity of the groundwater in the study area is controlled by sea water entered decades ago due to over-pumping of groundwater. Groundwater quality is also influenced by CEC as sulfamethoxazol, carbamazepine, methylparabene, propylparabene, bisphenol A, trichlosan, and 1-H-benzotriazole were detected in groundwater collected from an area exposed to irrigation with reclaimed water. The presence of these compounds indicates that they are not completely removed during soil passage according to incomplete sorption and/or biodegradation. Thus, these compounds are suggested as indicators of wastewater contamination confirming the pollution of groundwater resources at sites where wastewater is reused for irrigation in agriculture. Special attention has to be paid to the occurrence of TRS occurring in groundwater since this compound is recognized to produce antibiotic resistance in the environment.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography used for posttreatment responses evaluation of radiofrequency ablations for hepatocellular carcinoma: A meta-analysis,"Shi W., He Y., Ding W., Gong S., Wang Y., Xiao J., He B.",2016,British Journal of Radiology,"Objective: This meta-analysis aims to analyze the usefulness of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) for posttreatment responses evaluation of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) management. Methods: Literature retrieval in three databases PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library was conducted up to September 2015, with pre-defined criteria. The technical success rate, local tumour recurrence and local tumour progression were the measurement indexes. Cochran's Q test and I2 were used for heterogeneity detection. Subgroup analyses were performed for complete ablation rate stratified by study designs, contrast agents and post-operative testing time points. Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata® 12.0 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX). Results: 12 studies consisting of 772 patients were included in this study. The CEUS-evaluated success rate of RFA for HCCs was 91%. The proportion of ablative margin &lt;5mm was 53%. The local tumour recurrence rate and local tumour progression rate were 4% and 8%, respectively. Subgroup analysis indicated that the CEUS-assessed technical success rate with Sonazoid™ (Daiichi-Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan) as the contrast agent was higher (95%) than those with other agents [SH U 508A (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) 86%; SonoVue (Bracco SpA, Milan, Italy) 87%]. The success rate assessed within 24 h (94%) after treatment was higher than longer time (1-3 days 86%; 1 month 91%). Conclusion: The meta-analysis showed that the CEU Sevaluated success rate of RFA for HCCs was 91%. The local tumour recurrence rate and local tumour progression rate were 4% and 8%, respectively. Advances in knowledge: Using meta-analysis, the study provided more reliable assessment of usefulness of CEUS, which could provide guidelines for HCC treatment. © 2016 The Authors.",,"perflubutane; perfluoropentane; sonovue; contrast medium; Article; cancer growth; cancer recurrence; cancer surgery; clinical evaluation; Cochrane Library; contrast enhanced ultrasonography; contrast enhancement; echography; Embase; human; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; Medline; meta analysis (topic); outcome assessment; quality control; radiofrequency ablation; sensitivity analysis; treatment response; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; catheter ablation; diagnostic imaging; disease course; echography; Liver Neoplasms; meta analysis; tumor recurrence; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Catheter Ablation; Contrast Media; Disease Progression; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Ultrasonography",British Institute of Radiology
X-ray spectroscopic and scattering methods applied to the characterisation of cobalt-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalysts,"Herbert J.J., Senecal P., Martin D.J., Bras W., Beaumont S.K., Beale A.M.",2016,Catalysis Science and Technology,"This review aims to critically assess the use of X-ray techniques, both of a scattering (e.g. X-ray diffraction (XRD), pair distribution function (PDF)) and spectroscopic nature (X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS)), in the study of cobalt-based Fisher-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) catalysts. In particular, the review will focus on how these techniques have been successfully used to describe the salient characteristics of these catalysts that govern subsequent activity and selectivity, as well as to afford insight into deactivation phenomena that have seemingly stifled their application. We discuss how these X-ray-based techniques have been used to yield insight into the bulk structure, the catalyst surface, oxidation states, local (cobalt) geometry, and elemental composition of particles, primarily from a 1D perspective but we also highlight how, with recent developments in advanced X-ray characterisation methods, crucial information can now be obtained in 2D and 3D. The examples chosen focus on data acquired in situ/operando, under realistic operating conditions and during activation which often allow for obtaining a more relevant perspective on the changes in catalyst structure that accompany a change in catalyst performance. We conclude with a perspective on some of the challenges that beset the Co-based FTS technology and discuss how X-ray based techniques could be used to solve them. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Catalysts; Cobalt; Distribution functions; X ray absorption spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray spectroscopy; Catalyst performance; Catalyst structures; Deactivation phenomena; Elemental compositions; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalysts; Fisher-Tropsch synthesis; Operating condition; Pair distribution functions; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis,Royal Society of Chemistry
C8-T1 radiculopathy due to an intradural extramedullary metastasis of a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor: Case report and review of the literature,"Cabezas-Camarero S., Sastre J., Polidura M.C., Gómez-Ruíz M.N., Subhi-Issa I., Lera P.A., Paredes B.G., Díaz-Rubio E.",2016,Pancreas,"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) are usually wellto- moderately differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) that most often metastasize to the liver and lymph nodes with other locations being uncommon.We present a case of intradural pNET metastasis and conduct a review of the literature. Forty-five cases, including the case presently reported, of spinal cord compression due to well-differentiated NETs were found: carcinoid (80%), pNET (13.3%), and NETs of unknown primary (6.7%). Seventy-eight percent of cases consisted of extradural compressions from vertebral bone metastases, whereas there were only 5 cases of intradural extramedullary spinal cord compression. Most cases were managed with surgery and/or radiotherapy with a good clinical outcome in the majority. We report the first case of a pNET intradural extramedullary metastasis and conduct the largest review to date of an infrequent complication of well-differentiated NETs such as malignant spinal cord compression. Aggressive local treatment is warranted in most cases because it usually achieves neurologic improvement and symptomatic relief in patients who may still have a long life expectancy.

Lacking evidence for performance of implants used for proximal femoral fractures-A systematic review,"Nyholm A.M., Palm H., Malchau H., Troelsen A., Gromov K.",2016,Injury,"Introduction: Evaluation of the long-term performance of implants used in trauma surgery relies on post-marked clinical studies since no registry based implant assessment exists. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the evidence of performance of implants currently used for treating proximal femoral fractures (PFF) in Denmark. Method: PubMed was searched for clinical studies on primary PFF with follow-up ∼12 months, reporting implant-related failure and evaluating one of following: DHS, CHS, HipLoc, Gamma3, IMHS, InterTan, PFN, PFNA or PTN. Limits: English language and publication date after 1st of January 1990. Results: All studies were evidence level II or III. 30 publications for SHS were found: 13 of CHS, 15 of DHS and 2 of HipLoc. In total CHS was evaluated in 1110 patients (900 prospectively), DHS in 2486 (567 prospectively) and HipLoc in 251 (all prospectively). Fifty-four publications for nails were found: 13 of Gamma3, 7 of IMHS, 5 of InterTan, 10 of PFN, 24 of PFNA and 0 of PTN. In total Gamma3 was evaluated in 1088 patients (829 prospectively), IMHS in 1543 (210 prospectively), InterTan in 595 (585 prospectively), PFN in 716 (557 prospectively), PFNA in 1762 (1018 prospectively) and PTN in 0. Conclusions: The clinical evidence behind the current implants used for proximal femoral fractures is weak considering the number of implants used worldwide. Sporadic evaluation is not sufficient to identify long term problems. A systematic post market surveillance of implants used for fracture treatment, preferable by a national register, is necessary in the future. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Hepatic miRNA profiles and thyroid hormone homeostasis in rats exposed to dietary potassium perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS),"Dong H., Curran I., Williams A., Bondy G., Yauk C.L., Wade M.G.",2016,Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology,"Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) has been widely used in a variety of industrial and commercial applications as a surfactant and stain repellent. PFOS causes liver damage (including liver tumors) in experimental animals, primarily via interaction with PPARα and CAR/PXR. We investigated the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in PFOS-induced hepatotoxicity, and mechanisms involved in abnormal thyroid hormone (TH) homeostasis, in the livers of adult male rats exposed in feed to 50 mg PFOS/kg diet for 28 days. PFOS-treated rats exhibited expected histopathological and clinical chemistry changes, and global gene expression changes consistent with the involvement of PPARα and CAR/PXR. Thirty-eight miRNAs were significantly altered. Three members of the miR-200 family were the most increased, while miR-122-5p and miR-21-5p were the most decreased, in PFOS-treated rats. Expression of the miR-23b-3p/27b-3p/24-3p cluster also decreased in PFOS-treated animals. Pathway analysis of miRNAs and associated gene expression changes suggests involvement of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a primary process of tumor cell motility and cancer metastasis. Our analysis also revealed transcripts that may mediate PFOS-induced effects on TH homeostasis including: activation of the CAR/PXR pathway, phase II/III enzymes, and deiodinase. These changes are consistent with low serum TH due to enhanced metabolic clearance of TH. However, most TH hepatic target genes were not altered in a manner consistent with reduced TH signaling, suggesting that PFOS exposure did not induce functional hypothyroidism. Collectively, the study suggests an important role for miRNAs in PFOS-induced hepatotoxicity and provides insight into the effects of PFOS on TH homeostasis. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",EMT; Liver; Microarray; miRNA; PFOS,"constitutive androstane receptor; microRNA; microRNA 122 5p; microRNA 200; microRNA 21 5p; microRNA 23b 3p; microRNA 24 3p; microRNA 27b 3p; organofluorine derivative; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; potassium perfluorooctanesulfonate; pregnane X receptor; surfactant; thyroid hormone; thyroxine deiodinase; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; microRNA; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; potassium intake; thyroid hormone; transcriptome; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell motility; clinical chemistry; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; exposure; gene cluster; gene expression; gene function; histopathology; liver parenchyma; liver toxicity; male; metabolic clearance; metastasis; microarray analysis; multigene family; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; signal transduction; thyroid hormone metabolism; tumor cell; adverse effects; animal; blood; chemistry; drug effects; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; genetics; homeostasis; liver; potassium intake; Sprague Dawley rat; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Fluorocarbons; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; Homeostasis; Liver; Male; MicroRNAs; Potassium, Dietary; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Thyroid Hormones; Transcriptome",Elsevier B.V.
"Drugs of abuse, cytostatic drugs and iodinated contrast media in tap water from the Madrid region (central Spain): A case study to analyse their occurrence and human health risk characterization","Mendoza A., Zonja B., Mastroianni N., Negreira N., López de Alda M., Pérez S., Barceló D., Gil A., Valcárcel Y.",2016,Environment International,"This work analyses the presence of forty-eight emerging pollutants, including twenty-five drugs of abuse and metabolites, seventeen cytostatic drugs and six iodinated contrast media, in tap water from the Madrid Region. Analysis of the target compounds in the tap water was performed by means of (on-line or off-line) solid-phase extraction followed by analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A preliminary human health risk characterization was undertaken for each individual compound and for different groups of compounds with a common mechanism of action found in tap water. The results of the study showed the presence of eight out of the twenty-five drugs of abuse and metabolites analysed, namely, the cocainics cocaine and benzoylecgonine, the amphetamine-type stimulants ephedrine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and methamphetamine, the opioid methadone and its metabolite 2-ethylene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine and, finally caffeine at concentrations ranging from 0.11 to 502 ng L-1. Four out of the six analysed iodinated contrast media, namely, diatrizoate, iohexol, iomeprol and iopromide, were detected in at least one sample, with concentration values varying between 0.4 and 5ngL-1. Cytostatic compounds were not detected in any sample. Caffeine was the substance showing the highest concentrations, up to 502 ng L-1, mainly in the drinking water sampling point located in Madrid city. Among the other drugs of abuse, the most abundant compounds were cocaine and benzoylecgonine, detected at concentrations ranging from 0.11 to 86 ng L-1 and from 0.11 to 53 ng L-1, respectively. Regarding iodinated contrast media, iohexol was the most ubiquitous and abundant compound, with a frequency of detection of 100% and concentrations from 0.5 to 5.0 ng L-1 in basically the same range in all sampling points. Taking into account the results and types of treatment applied, ozonisation plus granular activated carbon filtration appears to be efficient in the removal of cocaine and benzoylecgonine. For the amphetamine-type stimulants, opioids and caffeine, ozonisation plus granular activated carbon filtration and ultrafiltration plus reverse osmosis showed higher removal efficiency than sand filtration. The human health risk characterization performed indicates that the lifetime consumption of the tap waters analysed has associated a negligible human health concern. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Anti-cancer drugs; Drinking water; Human health risk characterization; Illicit drugs; Pharmaceuticals,"Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Air filters; Biomolecules; Caffeine; Drug products; Granular materials; Health; Health risks; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; Ozonization; Phase separation; Potable water; Water pollution; 3 ,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine; Anticancer drug; Granular activated carbon filtration; Human health risks; Illicit drug; Iodinated contrast media; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Solid-phase extraction; Contrast media; 2 ethylidene 1,5 dimethyl 3,3 diphenylpyrrolidine; 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine; activated carbon; benzoylecgonine; caffeine; cocaine; cytostatic agent; diatrizoate; ephedrine; iodinated contrast medium; iohexol; iomeprol; iopromide; methadone; methamphetamine; tap water; contrast medium; cytostatic agent; drinking water; iodobenzoic acid derivative; street drug; water pollutant; activated carbon; drinking water; drug; filtration; health risk; risk assessment; Article; concentration (parameters); disinfection; filtration; fluid intake; health hazard; limit of detection; liquid chromatography; ozonation; priority journal; reverse osmosis; risk assessment; sand filtration; solid phase extraction; Spain; tandem mass spectrometry; ultrafiltration; waste component removal; water pollutant; analysis; environmental monitoring; human; mass spectrometry; procedures; public health; risk assessment; standards; water management; water pollutant; Madrid [Madrid (ADS/PRV)]; Madrid [Spain]; Spain; Chromatography, Liquid; Contrast Media; Cytostatic Agents; Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Iodobenzoates; Mass Spectrometry; Public Health; Risk Assessment; Solid Phase Extraction; Spain; Street Drugs; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Elsevier Ltd
High-density SNP map construction and QTL identification for the apetalous character in brassica napus L,"Wang X., Yu K., Li H., Peng Q., Chen F., Zhang W., Chen S., Hu M., Zhang J.",2015,Frontiers in Plant Science,"The apetalous genotype is a morphological ideotype for increasing seed yield and should be of considerable agricultural use; however, only a few studies have focused on the genetic control of this trait in Brassica napus. In the present study, a recombinant inbred line, the AH population, containing 189 individuals was derived from a cross between an apetalous line ‘APL01’ and a normally petalled variety ‘Holly’. The Brassica 60 K Infinium BeadChip Array harboring 52,157 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers was used to genotype the AH individuals. A high-density genetic linkage map was constructed based on 2,755 bins involving 11,458 SNPs and 57 simple sequence repeats, and was used to identify loci associated with petalous degree (PDgr). The linkage map covered 2,027.53 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.72 cM. The AH map had good collinearity with the B. napus reference genome, indicating its high quality and accuracy. After phenotypic analyses across five different experiments, a total of 19 identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) distributed across chromosomes A3, A5, A6, A9 and C8 were obtained, and these QTLs were further integrated into nine consensus QTLs by a meta-analysis. Interestingly, the major QTL qPD.C8-2 was consistently detected in all five experiments, and qPD.A9-2 and qPD.C8-3 were stably expressed in four experiments. Comparative mapping between the AH map and the B. napus reference genome suggested that there were 328 genes underlying the confidence intervals of the three steady QTLs. Based on the Gene Ontology assignments of 52 genes to the regulation of floral development in published studies, 146 genes were considered as potential candidate genes for PDgr. The current study carried out a QTL analysis for PDgr using a high-density SNP map in B. napus, providing novel targets for improving seed yield. These results advanced our understanding of the genetic control of PDgr regulation in B. napus. © 2015 Wang, Yu, Li, Peng, Chen, Zhang, Chen, Hu and Zhang.",Apetalous; Brassica napus L; High-density map; Quantitative trait locus; Recombinant inbred line; Single nucleotide polymorphism,,Frontiers Media S.A.
X-Vane: A sampling assembly combining a Niskin-X bottle and titanium frame vane for trace metal analysis of sea water,"Zhang R., Zhang J., Ren J., Li J., Li F., Wang Z., Zhu X.",2015,Marine Chemistry,"A new sampling assembly consisting of a commercially available 5-L Niskin-X sampling bottle attached to a titanium frame vane was designed for uncontaminated sampling of trace metals in sea water at volumes of 5. L per depth. The assembly, called an X-Vane sampler, consists of a titanium and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polymer supporting frame, a ""Π-style"" secure bottle assembly and secure messenger assembly with titanium springs, a polycarbonate weather vane rear fin assembly, a commercially available modified 5-L Niskin-X bottle, a small temperature and depth (TD) logger, and a nylon and stainless steel wire clamp. The X-Vane sampler permits positioning the Niskin-X bottle at upstream of the hydrowire, away from any contamination. The Teflon-coated messenger strikes the ""Π-style"" assembly, which closes the Niskin-X, thereby obtaining a sea water sample for trace metal analysis at the desired depth. A second messenger held by the ""Π-style"" assembly is released downward along the hydrowire. In this manner, several bottles can be triggered sequentially in one operation. The Niskin-X bottles are stored and processed in a PVC clean sample drawing enclosure with a clean environment created by three class-100 air filter vents. The X-vane sampling system is easy to operate and is low in cost, compared to other clean sampling methods. In addition, it can be adapted to different types of research vessels with different hydrowire conditions. Analyses of contamination-prone trace metals (Fe, Al, and Mn) showed that samples obtained using the X-Vane sampler were uncontaminated, and the analysis results were in good agreement with those for samples obtained using a MITESS-Vane sampler. The X-Vane sampling device was demonstrated to be a reliable device for obtaining sea water samples for trace metal analysis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Sampler; Sea water; Trace metals; Vane frame; X-vane,instrumentation; sampling; seawater; trace metal,Elsevier
Coupling of membrane filtration and advanced oxidation processes for removal of pharmaceutical residues: A critical review,"Ganiyu S.O., Van Hullebusch E.D., Cretin M., Esposito G., Oturan M.A.",2015,Separation and Purification Technology,"Pharmaceuticals as emerging pollutants have become a major concern not only because of the threat posed to health and safety of the aquatic life but also due to their continuous accumulation in aquatic environment and development of antibiotic-resistant microbial strains. Single classical water treatment techniques have been generally inadequate for the removal of these hazardous substances. Combined treatment techniques such as membrane separation and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is an exciting technology for complete removal of these pollutants because each technique complements the advantages and overcomes the challenges of the other. Technical flexibility of membrane separation technology has allowed possible integration/coupling with several AOPs as: pretreatment stage for removal of organics (which may cause membrane fouling) from membrane feed stream; post-treatment stage for oxidation of organics in both membrane permeate and concentrate streams or one pot/hybrid process for concurrent separation and oxidation of pollutants in the feed stream. AOPs such as ozonation, peroxone (O3/H2O2), UV/H2O2, photo-Fenton, photocatalysis and electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have been successfully integrated with membrane separation for removal of pharmaceuticals from water and they are critically examined in this review. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Abbreviations AO anodic oxidation; AOPs advanced oxidation processes; BAC biological activated carbon; BDD boron doped diamond; CBZ carbamazepine; CFM cross-flow filtration mode; CNT carbon nanotubes; COD chemical oxygen demand; DEF dead-end filtration mode; DIC diclofenac; DOC dissolve organic carbon; DWTP drinking water treatment plant; EAOPs electrochemical advanced oxidation processes; EDC endocrine disrupt compounds; EDDS ethylenediamine-N N-disuccinic acid trisodium salt; EF electro-Fenton; EMs electrochemical membranes; GAC granular activated carbon; GDEs gas diffused electrodes; HDPB hydrophobic; HDPL hydrophilic; I current intensity; IBU ibuprofen; J current density; MF micro-filtration; MW molecular weight; MWCO molecular weight cut-off; NF nanofiltration; NOM natural organic matters; PhACs pharmaceuticals; PMRs photocatalytic membrane reactors; PMs photocatalytic membranes; PPCPs pharmaceuticals and personal care products; Q charge density; RO reverse osmosis; ROC reverse osmosis concentrate; ROS reactive oxygen species; STD sub-stoichiometric titanium dioxide; STPs sewage treatment plants; TFC thin film composites; THMs trihalomethanes; TMP trans-membrane pressure; TOC total organic carbon; UF ultra-filtration; US sonolysis; UV ultra-violet; V velocity; WWTPs wastewater treatments plants,Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Antibiotics; Biological materials; Biological sewage treatment; Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Carbon nanotubes; Chemical oxygen demand; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Gas plants; Health risks; Membrane fouling; Membrane technology; Microfiltration; Molecular oxygen; Molecular weight; Nanocomposite films; Organic carbon; Osmosis membranes; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Potable water; Reverse osmosis; River pollution; Rivers; Sewage treatment plants; Titanium dioxide; Wastewater treatment; Water filtration; Yarn; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Biological activated carbon; Boron doped diamond; Carbamazepine; Cross flow filtration; Current intensity; Dead-end filtration modes; Diclofenac; EDC endocrine disrupt compounds; Electro-fenton; Electrochemical advanced oxidation process; Electrochemical membranes; Ethylene diamine; Granular activated carbons; HDPB hydrophobic; HDPL hydrophilic; IBU ibuprofen; Molecular weight cutoff; Natural organic matters; Pharmaceuticals and personal care products; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic membrane reactors; Reactive oxygen species; Reverse osmosis concentrates; Sonolysis; Thin film composites; Total Organic Carbon; Transmembrane pressures; Trihalomethanes; Ultra violet; WWTPs wastewater treatments plants; Anodic oxidation,Elsevier B.V.
Fetal growth and maternal glomerular filtration rate: A systematic review,"Vesterinen H.M., Johnson P.I., Atchley D.S., Sutton P., Lam J., Zlatnik M.G., Sen S., Woodruff T.J.",2015,Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine,"Objective: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may influence concentrations of biomarkers of exposure and their etiologic significance in observational studies of associations between environmental contaminants and fetal growth. It is unknown whether the size of a developing fetus affects maternal GFR such that a small fetus leads to reduced plasma volume expansion (PVE), reduced GFR and subsequent higher concentrations of biomarkers in maternal serum. Our objective was to answer the question: ""Is there an association between fetal growth and maternal GFR in humans?""Methods: We adapted and applied the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology to assess the evidence of an association between fetal growth and GFR, either directly or indirectly via reduction in PVE.Results: We identified 35 relevant studies. We rated 31 human and two non-human observational studies as ""low"" quality and two experimental non-human studies as ""very low"" quality. We rated all three evidence streams as ""inadequate"". The association between fetal growth and GFR was ""not classifiable"" according to pre-specified definitions.Conclusions: There is currently insufficient evidence to support the plausibility of a reverse causality hypothesis for associations between exposure to environmental chemicals during pregnancy and fetal growth.

Metabolic profiling of chicken embryos exposed to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and agonists to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors,"Mattsson A., Kärrman A., Pinto R., Brunström B.",2015,PLoS ONE,"Untargeted metabolic profiling of body fluids in experimental animals and humans exposed to chemicals may reveal early signs of toxicity and indicate toxicity pathways. Avian embryos develop separately from their mothers, which gives unique possibilities to study effects of chemicals during embryo development with minimal confounding factors from the mother. In this study we explored blood plasma and allantoic fluid from chicken embryos as matrices for revealing metabolic changes caused by exposure to chemicals during embryonic development. Embryos were exposed via egg injection on day 7 to the environmental pollutant perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and effects on the metabolic profile on day 12 were compared with those caused by GW7647 and rosiglitazone, which are selective agonists to peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) and PPARγ, respectively. Analysis of the metabolite concentrations from allantoic fluid by Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) showed clear separation between the embryos exposed to GW7647, rosiglitazone, and vehicle control, respectively. In blood plasma only GW7647 caused a significant effect on the metabolic profile. PFOA induced embryo mortality and increased relative liver weight at the highest dose. Sublethal doses of PFOA did not significantly affect the metabolic profile in either matrix, although single metabolites appeared to be altered. Neonatal mortality by PFOA in the mouse has been suggested to be mediated via activation of PPARα. However, we found no similarity in the metabolite profile of chicken embryos exposed to PFOA with those of embryos exposed to PPAR agonists. This indicates that PFOA does not activate PPAR pathways in our model at concentrations in eggs and embryos well above those found in wild birds. The present study suggests that allantoic fluid and plasma from chicken embryos are useful and complementary matrices for exploring effects on the metabolic profile resulting from chemical exposure during embryonic development. © 2015 Mattsson et al.

Screening for chemical contributions to breast cancer risk: A case study for chemical safety evaluation,"Schwarzman M.R., Ackerman J.M., Dairkee S.H., Fenton S.E., Johnson D., Navarro K.M., Osborne G., Rudel R.A., Solomon G.M., Zeise L., Janssen S.",2015,Environmental Health Perspectives,"BACKGROUND: Current approaches to chemical screening, prioritization, and assessment are being reenvisioned, driven by innovations in chemical safety testing, new chemical regulations, and demand for information on human and environmental impacts of chemicals. To conceptualize these changes through the lens of a prevalent disease, the Breast Cancer and Chemicals Policy project convened an interdisciplinary expert panel to investigate methods for identifying hemicals that may increase breast cancer risk. METHODS: Based on a review of current evidence, the panel identified key biological processes whose perturbation may alter breast cancer risk. We identified corresponding assays to develop the Hazard Identification Approach for Breast Carcinogens (HIA-BC), a method for detecting chemicals that may raise breast cancer risk. Finally, we conducted a literature-based pilot test of the HIA-BC. RESULTS: The HIA-BC identifies assays capable of detecting alterations to biological processes relevant to breast cancer, including cellular and molecular events, tissue changes, and factors that alter susceptibility. In the pilot test of the HIA-BC, chemicals associated with breast cancer all demonstrated genotoxic or endocrine activity, but not necessarily both. Significant data gaps persist. CONCLUSIONS: This approach could inform the development of toxicity testing that targets mechanisms relevant to breast cancer, providing a basis for identifying safer chemicals.

Clinical review: insulin pump-associated adverse events in adults and children,"Ross P.L., Milburn J., Reith D.M., Wiltshire E., Wheeler B.J.",2015,Acta Diabetologica,"Aims: Insulin pumps are a vital and rapidly developing tool in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus in both adults and children. Many studies have highlighted outcomes and assessed their potential advantages, but much of the data on adverse outcomes are limited and often based on outdated technology. We aimed to review and summarize the available literature on insulin pump-associated adverse events in adults and children. Methods: A literature search was undertaken using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library. Articles were then screened by title, followed by abstract, and full text as needed. A by-hand search of reference lists in identified papers was also utilised. All searches were limited to English language material, but no time limits were used. Results: Current and past literature regarding insulin pump-associated adverse events is discussed, including potential metabolic and non-metabolic adverse events, in particular: pump malfunction; infusion set/site issues; and cutaneous problems. We show that even with modern technology, adverse events are common, occurring in over 40 % of users per year, with a minority, particularly in children, requiring hospital management. Hyperglycaemia and ketosis are now the most common consequences of adverse events and are usually associated with infusion set failure. This differs from older technology where infected infusion sites predominated. Conclusions: This timely review covers all potential insulin pump-associated adverse events, including their incidence, features, impacts, and contributory factors such as the pump user. The importance of ongoing anticipatory education and support for patients and families using this intensive insulin technology is highlighted, which if done well should improve the overall experience of pump therapy for users, and hopefully reduce the incidence and impact of severe adverse events. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Italia.",Adverse event; Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion; Insulin pump; Type 1 diabetes,"insulin; insulin aspart; insulin derivative; insulin glulisine; insulin lispro; recombinant human insulin; short acting insulin; antidiabetic agent; insulin; catheter dislocation; catheter occlusion; clinical feature; clinical trial (topic); convulsion; device failure; device infection; diabetes mellitus; diabetic ketoacidosis; drug delivery system; drug hypersensitivity; erythema; heart arrest; heart fibrillation; hospital management; human; hyperglycemia; hyperkalemia; hypoglycemia; incidence; indwelling catheter; insulin pump; ketoacidosis; lipoatrophy; lipohypertrophy; medical technology; metabolic disorder; patient education; precipitation; priority journal; pump malfunction; Review; risk reduction; scar formation; skin disease; skin infection; skin irritation; skin manifestation; skin nodule; social psychology; unspecified side effect; adult; adverse effects; child; complication; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; insulin infusion; meta analysis; Adult; Child; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incidence; Insulin; Insulin Infusion Systems",Springer-Verlag Italia s.r.l.
Assfociations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with lower birth weight: An evaluation of potential confounding by glomerular filtration rate using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK),"Verner M.-A., Loccisano A.E., Morken N.-H., Yoon M., Wu H., McDougall R., Maisonet M., Marcus M., Kishi R., Miyashita C., Chen M.-H., Hsieh W.-S., Andersen M.E., Clewell H.J., III, Longnecker M.P.",2015,Environmental Health Perspectives,"BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been associated with lower birth weight in epidemiologic studies. This association could be attributable to glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is related to PFAS concentration and birth weight. OBJECTIVES: We used a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of pregnancy to assess how much of the PFAS–birth weight association observed in epidemiologic studies might be attributable to GFR. METHODS: We modified a PBPK model to reflect the association of GFR with birth weight (estimated from three studies of GFR and birth weight) and used it to simulate PFAS concentrations in maternal and cord plasma. The model was run 250,000 times, with variation in parameters, to simulate a population. Simulated data were analyzed to evaluate the association between PFAS levels and birth weight due to GFR. We compared simulated estimates with those from a meta-analysis of epidemiologic data. RESULTS: The reduction in birth weight for each 1-ng/mL increase in simulated cord plasma for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was 2.72 g (95% CI: –3.40, –2.04), and for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was 7.13 g (95% CI: –8.46, –5.80); results based on maternal plasma at term were similar. Results were sensitive to variations in PFAS level distributions and the strength of the GFR–birth weight association. In comparison, our meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies suggested that each 1-ng/mL increase in prenatal PFOS and PFOA levels was associated with 5.00 g (95% CI: –21.66, –7.78) and 14.72 g (95% CI: –8.92, –1.09) reductions in birth weight, respectively. CONCLUSION: Results of our simulations suggest that a substantial proportion of the association between prenatal PFAS and birth weight may be attributable to confounding by GFR and that confounding by GFR may be more important in studies with sample collection later in pregnancy. © 2015 Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Investigation of thickness dependence of metal layer in Al/Mo/4H-SiC Schottky barrier diodes,"Lee S., Lee J., Kang T.-Y., Kyoung S., Jung E.S., Kim K.H.",2015,Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology,"In this paper, we present the preparation and characterization of Schottky barrier diodes based on silicon carbide with various Schottky metal layer thickness values. In this structure, molybdenum and aluminum were employed as the Schottky barrier metal and top electrode, respectively. Schottky metal layers were deposited with thicknesses ranging from 1000 to 3000 Å, and top electrodes were deposited with thickness as much as 3000 Å. The deposition of both metal layers was performed using the facing target sputtering (FTS) method, and the fabricated samples were annealed with the tubular furnace at 300 °C under argon ambient for 10 min. The Schottky barrier height, series resistance, and ideality factor was calculated from the forward I-V characteristic curve using the methods proposed by Cheung and Cheung, and by Norde. For as-deposited Schottky diodes, we observed an increase of the threshold voltage (VT) as the thickness of the Schottky metal layer increased. After the annealing, the Schottky barrier heights (SBHs) of the diodes, including Schottky metal layers of over 2000 Å, increased. In the case of the Schottky metal layer deposited to 1000 Å, the barrier heights decreased due to the annealing process. This may have been caused by the interfacial penetration phenomenon through the Schottky metal layer. For variations of VT, the SBH changed with a similar tendency. The ideality factor and series resistance showed no significant changes before or after annealing. This indicates that this annealing condition is appropriate for Mo SiC structures. Our results confirm that it is possible to control VT by adjusting the thickness of the Schottky metal layer.

On-line sample extraction and purification for the LC-MS determination of emerging contaminants in environmental samples,"Valsecchi S., Polesello S., Mazzoni M., Rusconi M., Petrovic M.",2015,Trends in Environmental Analytical Chemistry,"In the present paper the application of on-line preparation techniques applied to LC-MS for the determination of emerging contaminants in environmental samples are critically reviewed highlighting the advantages but also the limits and the way to overcome them. Recent methods are collected in a detailed table and discussed in the text according to the different classes of compounds. The implementation of on-line SPE made possible the effective development of faster methods by reducing the analysis time and thus increasing the analytical productivity. The on-line SPE method are particularly suitable in studies where only limited sample material is available, as the sample volume can be as low as 1. mL. Most of the multiresidual methods have been developed using wettable and polar embedded reverse phases, sometimes sequentially packed with weak ionic exchangers in order to widen the polarity range of the adsorbents. On-line techniques have been also applied in cleanup of extracts of solid environmental samples, such as sediment, soil and biota, in order to minimize the ionization suppression effects from the matrix. Many applications employed RAM, often coupled to monolithic pre-concentration columns, but there is an increasing number of application of TFC for the determination of emerging pollutants in environmental samples. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Emerging contaminants; On-line-solid phase extraction; Perfluorinated compounds; Pharmaceuticals; Turbulent flow chromatography,,Elsevier
Size dependent ion-exchange of large mixed-metal complexes into Nafion® membranes,"Naughton E.M., Zhang M., Troya D., Brewer K.J., Moore R.B.",2015,Polymer Chemistry,"Perfluorosulfonate ionomers have been shown to demonstrate a profound affinity for large cationic complexes, and the exchange of these ions may be used to provide insight regarding Nafion® morphology by contrasting molecular size with existing morphological models. The trimetallic complex, [{(bpy)2Ru(dpp)}2RhBr2]5+, is readily absorbed by ion-exchange into Na+-form Nafion® membranes under ambient conditions. The dimensions of three different isomers of the trimetallic complex were found to be: 23.6 Å × 13.3 Å × 10.8 Å, 18.9 Å × 18.0 Å × 13.7 Å, and 23.1 Å × 12.0 Å × 11.4 Å, yielding an average molecular volume of 1.2 × 103 Å3. At equilibrium, the partition coefficient for the ion-exchange of the trimetallic complex into Nafion® from a DMF solution was found to be 5.7 × 103. Furthermore, the total cationic charge of the exchanged trimetallic complexes was found to counterbalance 86 ± 2% of the anionic SO3- sites in Nafion®. The characteristic dimensions of morphological models for the ionic domains in Nafion® were found to be comparable to the molecular dimensions of the large mixed-metal complexes. Surprisingly, SAXS analysis indicated that the complexes absorbed into the ionic domains of Nafion® without significantly changing the ionomer morphology. Given the profound affinity for absorption of these large cationic molecules, a more open-channel model for the morphology of perfluorosulfonate ionomers is more reasonable, in agreement with recent experimental findings. In contrast to smaller monometallic complexes, the time dependent uptake of the large trimetallic cations was found to be biexponential. This behavior is attributed to a fast initial ion-exchange process on the surface of the membrane, accompanied by a slower transport-limited ion-exchange for exchange sites that are buried further in the ionomer matrix. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,Ion exchange membranes; Ionomers; Ions; Isomers; Metal complexes; Morphology; Ion exchange process; Mixed-metal complexes; Molecular dimensions; Monometallic complex; Morphological model; Partition coefficient; Perfluorosulfonate ionomers; Trimetallic complexes; Ion exchange,Royal Society of Chemistry
Three plasma metabolite signatures for diagnosing high altitude pulmonary edema,"Guo L., Tan G., Liu P., Li H., Tang L., Huang L., Ren Q.",2015,Scientific Reports,"High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a potentially fatal condition, occurring at altitudes greater than 3,000 m and affecting rapidly ascending, non-acclimatized healthy individuals. However, the lack of biomarkers for this disease still constitutes a bottleneck in the clinical diagnosis. Here, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-TOF mass spectrometry was applied to study plasma metabolite profiling from 57 HAPE and 57 control subjects. 14 differential plasma metabolites responsible for the discrimination between the two groups from discovery set (35 HAPE subjects and 35 healthy controls) were identified. Furthermore, 3 of the 14 metabolites (C8-ceramide, sphingosine and glutamine) were selected as candidate diagnostic biomarkers for HAPE using metabolic pathway impact analysis. The feasibility of using the combination of these three biomarkers for HAPE was evaluated, where the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.981 and 0.942 in the discovery set and the validation set (22 HAPE subjects and 22 healthy controls), respectively. Taken together, these results suggested that this composite plasma metabolite signature may be used in HAPE diagnosis, especially after further investigation and verification with larger samples.",,"biological marker; adult; Altitude Sickness; blood; blood gas analysis; blood pressure; case control study; female; heart rate; high performance liquid chromatography; human; Hypertension, Pulmonary; male; mass spectrometry; metabolome; metabolomics; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; Adult; Altitude Sickness; Biomarkers; Blood Gas Analysis; Blood Pressure; Case-Control Studies; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Male; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolome; Metabolomics; ROC Curve",Nature Publishing Group
Treatment technologies for aqueous perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA): A critical review with an emphasis on field testing,"Arias Espana V.A., Mallavarapu M., Naidu R.",2015,Environmental Technology and Innovation,"Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are used in fire-fighting foams but this is now being questioned because concerns are growing about their toxicity and impacts on the environment. Past use has resulted in their widespread accumulation in water sources, sediments and biota. They may pose risks to human health and the environment. Several technologies have been tested for removing PFOS and PFOA from water but most have only been developed at laboratory scale. This paper provides a critical review of existing methods for removing PFOS and PFOA from wastewaters with an emphasis on identifying processes that show promise for the development of practical industrial-scale remediation technologies. It is concluded that among the remediation technologies cited in the literature, removal by activated carbon has been the most widely used, with several successful field tests being reported. However, a number of limitations to the use of activated carbon exist, such as being ineffective at removing PFOA and other PFCs. Other adsorbents that have the potential to treat aqueous PFOS and PFOA include organo-clays, clay minerals and carbon nanotubes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Adsorption; Filtration; Oxidation; Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS); Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA); Sonochemical decomposition,,Elsevier
"Assessing emerging wastewater regulations to minimize the risk from pharmaceuticals and personal care products: A case study in Wisconsin, USA","Blair B., Kehl J., Klaper R.",2015,Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal,"Purpose – Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and phosphorus are pollutants that can cause a wide array of negative environmental impacts. Phosphorus is a regulated pollutant in many industrial countries, while PPCPs are widely unregulated. Many technologies designed to remove phosphorus from wastewater can remove PPCPs, therefore the purpose of this paper is to explore the ability of these technologies to also reduce the emission of unregulated PPCPs. Design/methodology/approach – Through meta-analysis, the authors use the PPCPs’ risk quotient (RQ) to measure and compare the effectiveness of different wastewater treatment technologies. The RQ data are then applied via a case study that uses phosphorus effluent regulations to determine the ability of the recommended technologies to also mitigate PPCPs. Findings – The tertiary membrane bioreactor and nanofiltration processes recommended to remove phosphorus can reduce the median RQ from PPCPs by 71 and 81 percent, respectively. The ultrafiltration technology was estimated to reduce the median RQ from PPCPs by 28 percent with no cost in addition to the costs expected under the current phosphorus effluent regulations. RQ reduction is expected with a membrane bioreactor and the cost of upgrading to this technology was found to be $11.76 per capita/year. Practical implications – The authors discuss the management implications, including watershed management, alternative PPCPs reduction strategies, and water quality trading. Originality/value – The evaluation of the co-management of priority and emerging pollutants illuminates how the removal of regulated pollutants from wastewater could significantly reduce the emission of unregulated PPCPs. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Hormones; Management; Personal care products; Pharmaceuticals; Phosphorus; PPCPs; Risk; Wastewater,,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.
Microwave-assisted extraction of emerging pollutants in environmental and biological samples before chromatographic determination,"Sanchez-Prado L., Garcia-Jares C., Dagnac ., Llompart M.",2015,TrAC - Trends in Analytical Chemistry,"Two of the main topics of growing concern in analytical chemistry are the development of green analytical methods and the determination of emerging pollutants. One of the well-established green extraction techniques is microwave-assisted extraction (MAE). After giving a brief description of MAE principles, the present review comprehensively describes the applications of MAE in the past six years for the determination of the main families of emerging organic pollutants in the environment. Compared to other extraction techniques, MAE offers many advantages, such as great reductions in extraction time and solvent consumption, as well as the possibility of performing multiple extractions, thereby increasing sample throughput. From a technological point of view, most future application areas are likely to focus on improving the flexibility of recently introduced sequential systems with the capacity to control conditions in each extraction vessel. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",Chromatography-mass spectrometry; Emerging organic pollutant; Environmental analysis; Flame retardant; Microwave-assisted extraction; Personal-care product; Pharmaceutical; Plasticizer; Sample preparation; Surfactant,"Chemical analysis; Chromatography; Drug products; Extraction; Flame retardants; Mass spectrometry; Plasticizers; Pollution; Surface active agents; Chromatography-mass spectrometry; Environmental analysis; Microwave-assisted extraction; Personal care products; Sample preparation; Organic pollutants; alkylbenzenesulfonic acid; alkylphenol ethoxylate derivative; anesthetic agent; antifungal agent; antiinfective agent; antiinflammatory agent; bronchodilating agent; domestic chemical; environmental, industrial and domestic chemicals; flame retardant; fragrance; organophosphate; personal care product; pesticide; phenol; phenol derivative; phthalic acid derivative; preservative; sex hormone; steroid; unclassified drug; analytic method; chemical analysis; chemical interaction; chromatography; concentration (parameters); dielectric constant; environmental exposure; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; extraction; filter; high throughput screening; human; intermethod comparison; microwave assisted extraction; nonhuman; physical chemistry; pollutant; priority journal; Review; solvent extraction; ultraviolet filter",Elsevier B.V.
Efficacy of fast track surgery in elderly patients with colorectal cancer undergoing laparoscopic treatment: A meta-analysis,"Song M.-X., Li X.-R.",2015,World Chinese Journal of Digestology,"AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of fast track surgery in elderly patients with colorectal cancer undergoing laparoscopic treatment. METHODS: We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs), clinical controlled trials (CCTs) or case-control studies on fast track surgery in elderly patients with colorectal cancer undergoing laparoscopic treatment from databases including Wanfang, CNKI, CBM, VIP, PubMed, EMBACE and Cochrane Library between January 1989 and March 2015. Metaanalysis was performed with RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: There were 5 RCTs and 2 CCTs involving 476 patients, including 244 patients in the FTS group and 232 in the control group. Compared with the control group, the time to passage of flatus [weighted mean of difference (WMD) = -36.46, 95%CI: -40.91--32.02, P < 0.0001], time to resumption of diet/drink (WMD = -43.90, 95%CI: -48.79--39.01, P < 0.0001), time to ambulation (WMD = -6.60, 95%CI: -7.71--5.49, P < 0.0001), and hospital stay (WMD = -4.53, 95%CI: -5.13--3.92, P < 0.0001) were significantly shorter, and the incidence of postoperative complications was significantly lower in the FTS group [odds ratio (OR) = 0.18, 95%CI: 0.11-0.31, P < 0.0001].

Fluorine in medical microbubbles - Methodologies implemented for engineering and investigating fluorocarbon-based microbubbles,Krafft M.P.,2015,Journal of Fluorine Chemistry,"Gaseous microbubbles are being used in cardiovascular diagnostic procedures. They have further potential in diagnosis of tumours, vascular and blood flow abnormalities, as well as for targeted, ultrasound-triggered drug delivery and as intravascular mechanical devices. All the commercially available microbubble-based contrast agents comprise a fluorinated inner gas in their composition. Fluorinated components (fluorocarbon gases, self-assembling perfluoroalkylated surfactants) can play a key role in the engineering, investigation and development of microbubbles. Fluorocarbon gases provide osmotic stabilization and a co-surfactant contribution to interfacial tension reduction. Perfluoroalkylated surfactants self-assemble in aqueous media to form bubble shells with exceptional elasticity and resilience, and, optionally, effective anchorage for surface functionalization. This paper critically reviews the foremost methods used for preparing and monitoring microbubble suspensions. In particular, it identifies some common pitfalls encountered in the determination of microbubble sizes. The paper also reviews the methods used for collecting reliable data on the bubble morphology and shell structure that are required for understanding, controlling and improving their functional properties. Models for bubble shell studies include spontaneously adsorbed Gibbs films and spread Langmuir monolayers. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",Diagnosis; Fluorinated surfactant; Fluorocarbon; Microbubble; Targeted drug delivery; Ultrasound,,Elsevier

PBDEs comprehensive review of emerging pollutants and the particular case of Mexico [Revisión global de los contaminantes emergentes pbde y el caso particular de México],"Rocha-Gutiérrez B.A., Peralta-Pérez M.D.R., Zavala-Díaz de la Serna F.J.",2015,Revista Internacional de Contaminacion Ambiental,"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a specific group of emerging contaminants. These compounds are lipophilic, hydrophobic, nondegradable, and tend to bioaccumulate. The family of PBDEs consists of 209 isomers or congeners and their chemical structure, persistence and distribution in the environment follow similar patterns than the polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The main application of PBDEs is as flame retardants. They are added to electronics, appliances, textiles, furniture, carpets, construction materials and polymers. Globally, North America is the main consumer of the most toxic BDEs mix (penta-BDE) for humans and environment. The highest concentrations of PBDEs have been reported in the USA in wastewater and sewage sludge. In Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, similar concentrations of PBDEs to those of the USA were found in wastewater influents. There are no regulations for PBDEs monitoring, usage and disposal. However, some countries have eliminated and decreased the production and usage of this type of compounds. The aims of this paper were to review the most important aspects of these pollutants, to analyze the concentrations previously reported in wastewater and sewage sludge and to verify its environmental regulations in Mexico. © 2015, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM.

One drop chemical derivatization - DESI-MS analysis for metabolite structure identification,"Lubin A., Cabooter D., Augustijns P., Cuyckens F.",2015,Journal of Mass Spectrometry,"Structural elucidation of metabolites is an important part during the discovery and development process of new pharmaceutical drugs. Liquid Chromatography (LC) in combination with Mass Spectrometry (MS) is usually the technique of choice for structural identification but cannot always provide precise structural identification of the studied metabolite (e.g. site of hydroxylation and site of glucuronidation). In order to identify those metabolites, different approaches are used combined with MS data including nuclear magnetic resonance, hydrogen/deuterium exchange and chemical derivatization followed by LC-MS. Those techniques are often time-consuming and/or require extra sample pre-treatment. In this paper, a fast and easy to set up tool using desorption electrospray ionization-MS for metabolite identification is presented. In the developed method, analytes in solution are simply dried on a glass plate with printed Teflon spots and then a single drop of derivatization mixture is added. Once the spot is dried, the derivatized compound is analyzed. Six classic chemical derivatizations were adjusted to work as a one drop reaction and applied on a list of compounds with relevant functional groups. Subsequently, two successive reactions on a single spot of amoxicillin were tested and the methodology described was successfully applied on an in vitro incubated alprazolam metabolite. All reactions and analyses were performed within an hour and gave useful structural information by derivatizing functional groups, making the method a time-saving and efficient tool for metabolite identification if used in addition or in some cases as an alternative to common methods.

A systematic review on the effects of environmental exposure to some organohalogens and phthalates on early puberty,"Poursafa P., Ataei E., Kelishadi R.",2015,Journal of Research in Medical Sciences,"Early puberty is a common worldwide problem. Different parameters as genetics, metabolic diseases, obesity, as well as environmental factors may affect the age of puberty. This systematic review aims to survey the related literature on the effects of environmental pollutants and especially organohalogens and phthalates on early puberty. Materials and Methods: A systematic review of papers published in the English language was completed in January 2014. Studies on the associations of organohalogens and phthalates with the puberty time were included. A literature search was conducted in EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from 1995 to January 2014; moreover manual search through references of relevant manuscripts was considered. The literature search identified 212 papers, of which 13 papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the current study. Two reviewers independently identified relevant papers for potential inclusion and assessed the methodological quality. Results: This review included 6572 participants in nine countries from three continents (Europe, North America, and Asia). Different studies determined the effects of pollutants on maturation signs and pubertal stages and confirmed the association of organohalogens and phthalates with early puberty. Conclusion: Based on the studied literature, environmental pollutants surround and accumulate in human societies and their adverse health effects are well documented. It can be concluded that organohalogens and phthalates are disturbing the normal process of puberty timing; especially their influence on early maturation in girls should be underscored. © 2015 Journal of Research in Medical Sciences.",Early puberty; Organohalogens; Phthalates; Systematic review,organohalogen derivative; phthalic acid; environmental exposure; health promotion; human; maturity; non communicable disease; pollutant; pollution; prepuberty; prophylaxis; Review; systematic review,Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(IUMS)

Under normal physiological conditions, angiogenesis is well balanced and controlled by endogenous proangiogenic factors and antiangiogenic factors. However, factors produced by cancer cells, cancer stem cells and other cell types in the tumor stroma can disrupt the balance so that the tumor microenvironment favors tumor angiogenesis. These factors include vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial tissue factor and other membrane bound receptors that mediate multiple intracellular signaling pathways that contribute to tumor angiogenesis. Though environmental exposures to certain chemicals have been found to initiate and promote tumor development, the role of these exposures (particularly to low doses of multiple substances), is largely unknown in relation to tumor angiogenesis. This review summarizes the evidence of the role of environmental chemical bioactivity and exposure in tumor angiogenesis and carcinogenesis. We identify a number of ubiquitous (prototypical) chemicals with disruptive potential that may warrant further investigation given their selectivity for high-throughput screening assay targets associated with proangiogenic pathways. We also consider the cross-hallmark relationships of a number of important angiogenic pathway targets with other cancer hallmarks and we make recommendations for future research. Understanding of the role of low-dose exposure of chemicals with disruptive potential could help us refine our approach to cancer risk assessment, and may ultimately aid in preventing cancer by reducing or eliminating exposures to synergistic mixtures of chemicals with carcinogenic potential. © The Author 2015.

The scientific basis for the use of biomaterials in stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP),"Colaco M., Mettu J., Badlani G.",2015,BJU International,"Objectives To review the scientific and clinical literature to assess the basis for the use of biomaterials in stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Pelvic floor diseases (PFDS), such as SUI and POP, are common and vexing disorders. While synthetic mesh-based repairs have long been considered an option for PFD treatment, and their efficacy established in randomised clinical trials, safety of its use has recently been called into question. Materials and Methods Using the PubMed, MEDLINE and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) databases, we performed a critical review of English-language publications that contained the following keywords: 'pelvic organ prolapse', 'stress urinary incontinence', 'mesh', 'biomaterial', 'collagen', 'elastin' and 'extracellular matrix'. After reviewing for relevance for mesh use in the pelvis by two independent reviewers with a third available in the case of disagreement, a total of 60 articles were included in the present review. Results We found that many of the potential causes of PFDs are due to altered metabolism of patient extracellular matrix (specifically collagen, elastin, and their respective enzymes) and as such, repairs using native tissue may suffer from the same abnormalities leading to a subsequent lack of repair integrity. However, mesh use is not without its unique risks. Several publications have suggested that biomaterials may undergo alteration after implantation, but these findings have not been demonstrated in the normal milieu. Conclusion While the decision for the use of synthetic mesh is scientifically sound, its benefits and risks must be discussed with the patient in an informed decision-making process. © 2014 BJU International.",collagen; elastin; genetics; mesh; pelvic organ prolapse; stress urinary incontinence,"biomaterial; collagen; elastin; biomaterial; collagen; elastin; biomechanics; chemical composition; decision making; device safety; extracellular matrix; genetic predisposition; human; medical device; medical device complication; molecular pathology; pathophysiology; pelvic organ prolapse; priority journal; Review; risk benefit analysis; stress incontinence; synthetic mesh; systematic review; treatment planning; female; pelvic organ prolapse; randomized controlled trial (topic); surgical mesh; Urinary Incontinence, Stress; Biocompatible Materials; Collagen; Elastin; Female; Humans; Pelvic Organ Prolapse; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Surgical Mesh; Urinary Incontinence, Stress",Blackwell Publishing Ltd
Prenatal exposure to environmental chemical contaminants and asthma and eczema in school-age children,"Smit L.A.M., Lenters V., Høyer B.B., Lindh C.H., Pedersen H.S., Liermontova I., Jönsson B.A.G., Piersma A.H., Bonde J.P., Toft G., Vermeulen R., Heederik D.",2015,Allergy: European Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,"Abstract Background Emerging evidence suggests that prenatal or early-life exposures to environmental contaminants may contribute to an increased risk of asthma and allergies in children. We aimed to the explore associations of prenatal exposures to a large set of environmental chemical contaminants with asthma and eczema in school-age children. Methods We studied 1024 mother-child pairs from Greenland and Ukraine from the INUENDO birth cohort. Data were collected by means of an interview-based questionnaire when the children were 5-9 years of age. Questions from the ISAAC study were used to define asthma, eczema, and wheeze. We applied principal components analysis (PCA) to sixteen contaminants in maternal serum sampled during pregnancy, including perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), metabolites of diethylhexyl (DEHP) and diisononyl (DiNP) phthalates, PCB-153, and p,p'-DDE. Scores of five principal components (PCs) explaining 70% of the variance were included in multiple logistic regression models. Results In a meta-analysis that included both populations, the PC2 score, reflecting exposure to DiNP, was negatively associated with current eczema (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96). Other associations were not consistent between the two populations. In Ukrainian children, the PC3 score (DEHP) was positively associated with current wheeze (adjusted OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.03-2.37), whereas the PC5 score, dominated by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), was inversely associated with current wheeze (OR 0.64, 0.41-0.99). In Greenlandic children, a negative association of PC4 (organochlorines) with ever eczema (OR 0.78, 0.61-0.99) was found. Conclusions We found limited evidence to support a link between prenatal exposure to environmental chemical contaminants and childhood asthma and eczema. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

A broad cocktail of environmental pollutants found in eggs of three seabird species from remote colonies in Norway,"Huber S., Warner N.A., Nygård T., Remberger M., Harju M., Uggerud H.T., Kaj L., Hanssen L.",2015,Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Eggs of 3 seabird species, common eider (Somateria mollisima), European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis aristotelis), and European herring gull (Larus argentatus), were surveyed for a broad range of legacy and emerging pollutants to assess chemical mixture exposure profiles of seabirds from the Norwegian marine environment. In total, 201 chemical substances were targeted for analysis ranging from metals, organotin compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and associated metabolites, chlorinated paraffins, chlorinated and nonchlorinated organic pesticides, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), dechlorane plus, octachlorostyrene, brominated flame retardants (BFRs), organophosphorous compounds, brominated and alkyl phenols, cyclic siloxanes, and phthalates. Of the chemicals targeted, 149 substances were found above the detection limits, with metals dominating the contaminant profile and comprising 60% of the total contaminant load. Polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides, organophosphorous compounds, and PFAS were the dominant contaminant classes of organic pollutants found within the seabird species, with the highest loads occurring in herring gulls, followed by shag, and common eider. New generation pollutants (e.g., PFAS, organophosphorous compounds, and alkylphenols) were detected at similar or higher concentrations than the legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Time trends of reported concentrations of legacy POPs appear to have decreased in recent decades from the Norwegian coastal environment. Concentrations of detected pollutants do not appear to have a negative effect on seabird population development within the sampling area. Additional stress caused by pollutants, however, may affect seabird health more at the individual level. © 2015 SETAC.",Contaminants; Ecotoxicology; Emerging pollutants; Heavy metals; Persistent organic pollutants,"Aromatic hydrocarbons; Chemical analysis; Chemical compounds; Chemical detection; Contamination; Flame retardants; Heavy metals; Impurities; Marine pollution; Organometallics; Pesticides; Pollution; Pollution detection; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Silicon compounds; Brominated flame retardants (BFRs); Eco-toxicology; Emerging pollutants; Organophosphorous compounds; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Persistent organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Organic pollutants; alkylphenol; arsenic; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; flame retardant; lead; mercury; metal derivative; nickel; organochlorine pesticide; organophosphorus compound; organotin compound; paraffin; phenol derivative; phthalic acid derivative; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative; siloxane; silver; zinc; diphenyl ether derivative; heavy metal; pesticide; pollutant; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; concentration (composition); ecotoxicology; egg; heavy metal; marine environment; metabolite; organic pollutant; PAH; PCB; pesticide; pollution exposure; seabird; Article; bioaccumulation; coastal waters; egg; feeding behavior; Larus argentatus; limit of detection; marine environment; metabolic capacity; metabolite; nonhuman; Norway; persistent organic pollutant; Phalacrocorax aristotelis aristotelis; pollutant; priority journal; reproductive success; seabird; Somateria mollisima; species; trophic level; analysis; animal; bird; chemistry; environmental monitoring; growth, development and aging; metabolism; oocyte; pollutant; principal component analysis; Norway; Larus argentatus; Larus argentatus argenteus; Phalacrocorax aristotelis; Somateria mollissima; Animals; Birds; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Metals, Heavy; Norway; Ovum; Pesticides; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Principal Component Analysis",Wiley Blackwell
"Dynamic hip screw, proximal femoral nail antirotation and InterTan nail for intertrochanteric fractures","Shao J., Yang T.-Y., Wang Z., Zhang Y., Liu S.-Y.",2015,Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research,"BACKGROUND: The extramedullary fixation system including dynamic hip screw (DHS) is commonly used in treatment of Intertrochanteric fracture. However, in patients with unstable intertrochanteric fracture, extramedullary fixation system often leads to the failure of fracture fixation. Intramedullary fixation system including both proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) and InterTan nail has been widely used in the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures. OBJECTIVE: To compare the therapeutic effects of extramedullary fixation system containing DHS, PFNA and InterTan nail in the treatment of intertrochanteric fracture. METHODS: Literatures were searched in Wanfang, PubMed, Embase, Medline, the Cochrane library to screen literatures published from January 1990 to November 2014. Relevant studies addressing extramedullary fixation system containing DHS, PFNA and InterTan nail were screened.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: 346 articles were screened, and 13 of them were in accordance with the inclusion criteria. 1 271 patients with different types of intertrochanteric fracture were assessed in this study. Compared to DHS group, patients treated with PFNA and InterTan nail had shorter operation time and less blood loss. No significant difference in rehabilitation time and Harris score was detected among three kinds of fixation methods. Additionally, PFNA and InterTan nail had a similar effect. These findings verify that compared with DHS, PFNA and InterTan nail can optimize the surgery, but cannot elevate postoperative outcomes. © 2015, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

Polytetrafluoroethylene fume-induced pulmonary edema: A case report and review of the literature,"Hamaya R., Ono Y., Chida Y., Inokuchi R., Kikuchi K., Tameda T., Tase C., Shinohara K.",2015,Journal of Medical Case Reports,"Introduction: Polytetrafluoroethylene is ubiquitous in materials commonly used in cooking and industrial applications. Overheated polytetrafluoroethylene can generate toxic fumes, inducing acute pulmonary edema in some cases. However, neither the etiology nor the radiological features of this condition have been determined. For clarification, we report an illustrative case, together with the first comprehensive literature review. Case presentation: A previously healthy 35-year-old Japanese man who developed severe dyspnea presented to our hospital. He had left a polytetrafluoroethylene-coated pan on a gas-burning stove for 10 hours while unconscious. Upon admission, he was in severe respiratory distress. A chest computed tomographic scan showed massive bilateral patchy consolidations with ground-glass opacities and peripheral area sparing. A diagnosis of polytetrafluoroethylene fume-induced pulmonary edema was made. He was treated with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and a neutrophil elastase inhibitor, which dramatically alleviated his symptoms and improved his oxygenation. He was discharged without sequelae on hospital day 11. A literature review was performed to survey all reported cases of polytetrafluoroethylene fume-induced pulmonary edema. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and OvidSP databases for reports posted between the inception of the databases and 30 September 2014, as well as several Japanese databases (Ichushi Web, J-STAGE, Medical Online, and CiNii). Two radiologists independently interpreted all chest computed tomographic images. Eighteen relevant cases (including the presently reported case) were found. Our search revealed that (1) systemic inflammatory response syndrome was frequently accompanied by pulmonary edema, and (2) common computed tomography findings were bilateral ground-glass opacities, patchy consolidation and peripheral area sparing. Pathophysiological and radiological features were consistent with the exudative phase of acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, the contrast between the lesion and the spared peripheral area was striking and was distinguishable from the common radiological features of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Conclusion: The essential etiology of polytetrafluoroethylene fume-induced pulmonary edema seems to be increased pulmonary vascular permeability caused by an inflammatory response to the toxic fumes. The radiological findings that distinguish polytetrafluoroethylene fume-induced pulmonary edema can be bilateral ground-glass opacity or a patchy consolidation with clear sparing of the peripheral area. © 2015 Hamaya et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Neutrophil elastase inhibitor; Peripheral area sparing; Pulmonary inflammation; Radiological features; Teflon®; Toxic fumes,"politef; sivelestat; politef; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; arterial oxygen tension; Article; auscultation; case report; computer assisted tomography; coughing; crackle; disease severity; dyspnea; fire; human; lung edema; lung infiltrate; male; neutrophil count; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; respiratory distress; systemic inflammatory response syndrome; thorax radiography; chemically induced; lung; Pulmonary Edema; radiography; Adult; Dyspnea; Humans; Lung; Male; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Positive-Pressure Respiration; Pulmonary Edema; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",BioMed Central Ltd.
Insights into the anaerobic biodegradation pathway of n-Alkanes in oil reservoirs by detection of signature metabolites,"Bian X.-Y., Mbadinga S.M., Liu Y.-F., Yang S.-Z., Liu J.-F., Ye R.-Q., Gu J.-D., Mu B.-Z.",2015,Scientific Reports,"Anaerobic degradation of alkanes in hydrocarbon-rich environments has been documented and different degradation strategies proposed, of which the most encountered one is fumarate addition mechanism, generating alkylsuccinates as specific biomarkers. However, little is known about the mechanisms of anaerobic degradation of alkanes in oil reservoirs, due to low concentrations of signature metabolites and lack of mass spectral characteristics to allow identification. In this work, we used a multidisciplinary approach combining metabolite profiling and selective gene assays to establish the biodegradation mechanism of alkanes in oil reservoirs. A total of twelve production fluids from three different oil reservoirs were collected and treated with alkali; organic acids were extracted, derivatized with ethanol to form ethyl esters and determined using GC-MS analysis. Collectively, signature metabolite alkylsuccinates of parent compounds from C1 to C8 together with their (putative) downstream metabolites were detected from these samples. Additionally, metabolites indicative of the anaerobic degradation of mono- and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (2-benzylsuccinate, naphthoate, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-naphthoate) were also observed. The detection of alkylsuccinates and genes encoding for alkylsuccinate synthase shows that anaerobic degradation of alkanes via fumarate addition occurs in oil reservoirs. This work provides strong evidence on the in situ anaerobic biodegradation mechanisms of hydrocarbons by fumarate addition.",,"alkane; bacterial DNA; petroleum; anaerobic bacterium; bioremediation; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; Alkanes; Bacteria, Anaerobic; Base Sequence; Biodegradation, Environmental; DNA, Bacterial; Molecular Sequence Data; Petroleum",Nature Publishing Group
Clinical management of vitreomacular traction,"Khan M.A., Haller J.A.",2015,Current Opinion in Ophthalmology,"Purpose of review To describe recent evidence regarding the clinical management of vitreomacular traction (VMT). Recent findings Recent studies have reported favorable outcomes in patients with VMT managed with observation, pharmacologic vitreolysis with ocriplasmin, and intravitreal perfluoropropane gas. Subgroup analysis has identified features associated with spontaneous release of VMT as well as features associated with successful pharmacologic release of VMT with ocriplasmin. Summary Observation may be an appropriate initial recommendation for patients with mild VMT. When treatment is necessary, pharmacologic vitreolysis with ocriplasmin is an effective nonsurgical therapeutic option. Careful patient selection improves success rates with ocriplasmin. Further study is necessary to establish the efficacy of intravitreal perfluoropropane gas for VMT as well as the efficacy of ocriplasmin in patients with VMT and concurrent retinal disease. As these treatments are more widely used, prospective data will continue to clarify their risk/benefit profile. Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Metal fume fever and polymer fume fever,"Greenberg M.I., Vearrier D.",2015,Clinical Toxicology,"Introduction. Inhalational exposure to metal-containing fumes generated by welding and related processes may result in the development of the clinical syndrome known as ""metal fume fever."" Polymer fume fever is a separate and distinct but related disorder that has been associated with inhalational exposure to specific fluorinated polymer products, such as polytetrafluoroethylene or Teflon®. We undertook a review of the peer-reviewed medical literature as it relates to these two disease entities in order to describe their epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and prognosis. Methodology. We performed a search of the PubMed (www.pubmed.com) and Ovid MEDLINE (ovidsp.tx.ovid.com) databases for keywords ""metal fume fever,"" ""polymer fume fever,"" and ""fume fever,"" covering the period 1946 to September 2014, which resulted in a total of 141 citations. Limiting the search to articles published in the English language yielded 115 citations. These 115 articles were manually reviewed for relevance. In addition, the reference lists in each article retrieved were reviewed for additional relevant references. This left 48 relevant citations. Epidemiology. Metal fume fever occurs most commonly as an occupational disease in individuals who perform welding and other metal-joining activities for a living. It is estimated that 1,5002,500 cases of metal fume fever occur annually in the United States. Polymer fume fever was initially identified as an occupational disease but increased regulations have resulted in decreased incidence in the occupational setting. Overheating of Teflon®-coated cookware is one of the more common mechanisms for exposure. Pathophysiology. While the precise pathophysiology associated with the development of metal fume fever is yet to be elucidated, suggested pathophysiologic mechanisms include pro-inflammatory cytokine release, neutrophil activation, and oxygen radical formation. The pathophysiologic mechanism for polymer fume fever has not been definitively elucidated but may involve similar mechanisms to those proposed for metal fume fever. Clinical presentation. Metal fume fever typically presents with generally non-specific complaints including influenza-like symptoms, fever, shaking chills, arthalgias, myalgias, headache, and malaise. Onset of symptoms typically occurs 410 h following the exposure to metal-containing fumes. While metal fume fever is typically benign and self-limited, severe cases of the disease have been reported. In patients with ongoing metal fume exposure over the course of a workweek, tachyphylaxis occurs resulting in improvement in symptoms over the course of the workweek and maximal symptoms occurring after an exposure-free period such as a weekend. The clinical presentation of polymer fume fever is indistinguishable from metal fume fever, with an exposure history being necessary to distinguish the two entities. Diagnosis. Chest radiographs are typically normal in cases of metal fume fever and polymer fume fever; however, mild vascular congestion may be demonstrated and severe cases may feature diffuse patchy infiltrates. Laboratory studies are typically not necessary but may demonstrate leukocytosis with leftward shift or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Treatment. The primary treatment for both metal fume fever and polymer fume fever is supportive and directed at symptom relief. Oral hydration, rest, and the use of antipyretics and anti-inflammatory medications (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin) are recommended. A careful workplace exposure assessment analysis conducted by an occupational medicine specialist or clinical toxicologist in concert with a qualified industrial hygienist should be performed. Prevention. A careful workplace exposure assessment including measurement of ambient zinc and other metal (e.g., chrome, nickel, copper and manganese) fume concentrations or concentrations of fluorocarbon polymer decomposition products at different locations within the workplace should be performed. Prognosis. Metal fume fever is typically a benign and self-limited disease entity that resolves over 1248 h following cessation of exposure. Conclusions. Metal and polymer fume fevers generally follow a benign course with spontaneous resolution of symptoms, though both have the potential to be serious, especially in those with significant preexisting cardiorespiratory disease. © 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",Inhalation; Lung; Welding,acetylsalicylic acid; aluminum; antimony; antipyretic agent; beryllium; boron; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; fluorocarbon; iron; lead; magnesium; manganese; metal; nickel; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; oxygen radical; politef; polymer; selenium; tin; vanadium; zinc; artificial ventilation; chill; clinical feature; cytokine release; endotracheal intubation; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; fever; flu like syndrome; headache; human; leukocyte activation; leukocytosis; malaise; metal fume fever; myalgia; occupational disease; occupational exposure; oral rehydration therapy; pathophysiology; polymer fume fever; prognosis; rest; Review; symptom; systematic review; tachyphylaxis; thorax radiography; venous congestion; welding fume; working time,Informa Healthcare
Metabolic flux analysis of Escherichia coli MG1655 under octanoic acid (C8) stress,"Fu Y., Yoon J.M., Jarboe L., Shanks J.V.",2015,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,"Systems metabolic engineering has made the renewable production of industrial chemicals a feasible alternative to modern operations. One major example of a renewable process is the production of carboxylic acids, such as octanoic acid (C8), from Escherichia coli, engineered to express thioesterase enzymes. C8, however, is toxic to E. coli above a certain concentration, which limits the final titer. 13C metabolic flux analysis of E. coli was performed for both C8 stress and control conditions using NMR2Flux with isotopomer balancing. A mixture of labeled and unlabeled glucose was used as the sole carbon source for bacterial growth for 13C flux analysis. By comparing the metabolic flux maps of the control condition and C8 stress condition, pathways that were altered under the stress condition were identified. C8 stress was found to reduce carbon flux in several pathways: the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the CO2 production, and the pyruvate dehydrogenase pathway. Meanwhile, a few pathways became more active: the pyruvate oxidative pathway, and the extracellular acetate production. These results were statistically significant for three biological replicates between the control condition and C8 stress. As a working hypothesis, the following causes are proposed to be the main causes for growth inhibition and flux alteration for a cell under stress: membrane disruption, low activity of electron transport chain, and the activation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase regulator (PdhR). © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Escherichia coli; Metabolic flux analysis; Octanoic acid; Toxicity,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Electron transport properties; Enzyme activity; Escherichia coli; Industrial chemicals; Metabolic engineering; Metabolism; Saturated fatty acids; Toxicity; Electron transport chain; Feasible alternatives; Isotopomer balancing; Membrane disruption; Metabolic flux analysis; Octanoic acids; Systems metabolic engineerings; Tricarboxylic acids; Fatty acids; glucose; octanoic acid; octanoic acid derivative; pyruvic acid; chemistry; citric acid cycle; Escherichia coli; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolic flux analysis; metabolism; Caprylates; Citric Acid Cycle; Escherichia coli; Glucose; Metabolic Flux Analysis; Pyruvic Acid",Springer Verlag
Metabolomic analysis reveals altered skeletal muscle amino acid and fatty acid handling in obese humans,"Baker P.R., Boyle K.E., Koves T.R., Ilkayeva O.R., Muoio D.M., Houmard J.A., Friedman J.E.",2015,Obesity,"Objective Investigate the effects of obesity and high-fat diet (HFD) exposure on fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle intermediates and amino acids in skeletal muscle to better characterize energy metabolism. Methods Plasma and skeletal muscle metabolomic profiles were measured from lean and obese males before and after a 5-day HFD in the 4 h postprandial condition. Results At both time points, plasma short-chain acylcarnitine species (SCAC) were higher in the obese subjects, while the amino acids glycine, histidine, methionine, and citrulline were lower in skeletal muscle of obese subjects. Skeletal muscle medium-chain acylcarnitines (MCAC) C6, C8, C10:2, C10:1, C10, and C12:1 increased in obese subjects, but decreased in lean subjects, from pre- to post-HFD. Plasma content of C10:1 was also decreased in the lean but increased in the obese subjects from pre- to post-HFD. CD36 increased from pre- to post-HFD in obese but not lean subjects. Conclusions Lower skeletal muscle amino acid content and accumulation of plasma SCAC in obese subjects could reflect increased anaplerosis for TCA cycle intermediates, while accumulation of MCAC suggests limitations in β-oxidation. These measures may be important markers of or contributors to dysregulated metabolism observed in skeletal muscle of obese humans. © 2015 The Obesity Society.",,"acylcarnitine; amino acid; CD36 antigen; citrulline; fatty acid; glycine; histidine; methionine; tricarboxylic acid; acylcarnitine; amino acid; carnitine; fatty acid; adult; amino acid analysis; amino acid blood level; Article; Caucasian; controlled study; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; human; human tissue; lean body weight; lipid diet; male; metabolomics; obesity; postprandial state; skeletal muscle; analogs and derivatives; blood; comparative study; lipid metabolism; metabolism; obesity; oxidation reduction reaction; pathophysiology; physiology; skeletal muscle; Adult; Amino Acids; Carnitine; Diet, High-Fat; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Metabolomics; Muscle, Skeletal; Obesity; Oxidation-Reduction; Postprandial Period",
Degradation of TAIC by water falling film dielectric barrier discharge - Influence of radical scavengers,"Rong S., Sun Y.",2015,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"This work describes the application of plasma generated by water falling film dielectric barrier discharge for the degradation of triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC). The results indicated that TAIC solution of 1000mg/L was effectively removed within 60min treatment at 120W output power. Six intermediates were identified and a possible evolution of the TAIC degradation process was continuously proposed basing on the results of mass spectrum analysis. The effects of metal ions and radical scavengers were investigated. Results showed that whatever hydrogen radical scavengers (carbon tetrachloride, perfluorooctane) or hydroxyl radical scavengers (iso-propyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol) all could further enhance the degradation processes, and both kings of radical scavengers could promote the generation of H2O2. In the present study, we employed a novel method by introducing the mixed additives of Fe2+ and radical scavengers into the plasma. It was found that the reaction rate constant and energy efficiency were improved by 309.2% and 387.8%, respectively. Among the mixed additives, Fe2+ could promote the decomposition and increase the oxidizing power of H2O2, which is generated from the plasma discharge and greatly enhanced by the radical scavengers. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Degradation efficiency; Energy efficiency; Plasma discharge; Radical scavengers; TAIC,"Alcohols; Degradation; Dielectric devices; Electric discharges; Energy efficiency; Flow control; Mass spectrometry; Metal ions; Rate constants; Scavenging; Spectrum analysis; Degradation efficiency; Degradation process; Dielectric barrier discharges; Mass spectrum analysis; Plasma discharge; Radical scavengers; TAIC; Triallyl isocyanurate; Dielectric materials; cyanuric acid; hydrogen peroxide; hydroxyl radical; iron; metal ion; scavenger; triallyl isocyanurate; unclassified drug; water; 1,3,5-triallyl isocyanurate; 2 propanol; carbon tetrachloride; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctane; scavenger; tert butyl alcohol; triazine derivative; water; water pollutant; biodegradation; decomposition; discharge; energy efficiency; hydrogen; hydrogen peroxide; oxidation; plasma; radical; aqueous solution; Article; chemical structure; decomposition; drug degradation; Fenton reaction; film; pH; radical reaction; ultrasound; chemistry; electrochemistry; procedures; sewage; water pollutant; 2-Propanol; Carbon Tetrachloride; Electrochemistry; Fluorocarbons; Free Radical Scavengers; Hydrogen Peroxide; Hydroxyl Radical; Iron; tert-Butyl Alcohol; Triazines; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier
Creating a gold standard surgical device: scientific discoveries leading to TVT and beyond: Ulf Ulmsten Memorial Lecture 2014,Petros P.,2015,International Urogynecology Journal and Pelvic Floor Dysfunction,"Introduction and hypothesis: The discovery of tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) began in 1986 with two unrelated observations: pressure applied unilaterally at the midurethra controlled urine loss on coughing; implanted Teflon tape caused a collagenous tissue reaction. Methods and results: In 1987, Mersilene tape was implanted retropubically in 13 large dogs, with the aim of creating an artificial collagenous pubourethral neoligament. Extensive testing showed that the operation was safe and effective. In 1988–1989, human testing was carried out (n = 30). Mersilene tape cured 100 % of stress and mixed incontinence with a sling in situ; however, there was simultaneous recurrence of the two symptoms in 50 % on sling removal. X-rays showed no elevation of the bladder neck. In 1990–1993, collaboration with Ulf Ulmsten took place: a permanently implanted tape was required. Polypropylene was the ideal material. In 2003, the neoligament principle was applied as an adjustable “micro” sling to the arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis (ATFP), cardinal, uterosacral ligaments, and perineal body for cure of cystocele, rectocele, and apical prolapse. It was found that symptoms such as urgency, nocturia, chronic pelvic pain, obstructive defecation syndrome (ODS), and fecal incontinence were frequently cured or improved. Conclusions: The lecture concluded with advice to younger members. Without new paradigms, there are no randomized controlled trials, no meta-analyses, Cochrane. Indeed, no progress. Be open to new concepts. Read Kuhn’s “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions” to understand the discovery process.

Methodology for studying biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl precursors in the environment,"Ruan T., Lin Y., Wang T., Jiang G., Wang N.",2015,TrAC - Trends in Analytical Chemistry,"Biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl precursors contributes in part to the perfluoroalkyl carboxylates and sulfonates detected in the global environment and biota. Robust sample preparation and sensitive analytical techniques for maximum analyte recovery are essential to identify and to quantify biotransformation products often present at low levels in environmental matrices and experimental systems. This critical review covers current sample-preparation and analytical methods, including extraction, concentration, clean-up and derivatization, mass spectrometry coupled to gas or liquid chromatography, and radioisotope labeling and tracking techniques. We also critically review methodologies for molecular structural elucidation and in-silico prediction of potential transformation products. We describe current knowledge gaps and challenges in studying novel alternative polyfluoroalkyl substances. We discuss future trends on utilizing advanced analytical techniques. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Biotransformation; Chromatography separation; Extraction; Mass spectrometry; Perfluoroalkyl carboxylate; Perfluoroalkyl sulfonate; Persistent organic pollutant; Polyfluoroalkyl precursor; Quantitative structure-activity relationship; Sample preparation,Bioconversion; Carboxylation; Extraction; Gas chromatography; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Organic pollutants; Spectrometry; Biotransformation; Perfluoroalkyl carboxylate; Perfluoroalkyl sulfonate; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Polyfluoroalkyl precursor; Quantitative structure activity relationship; Sample preparation; Chromatography; chemical compound; polyfluoroalkyl precursor; unclassified drug; analytic method; biotransformation; chemical structure; computer analysis; concentration (parameters); derivatization; extraction; isotope labeling; liquid chromatography; mass fragmentography; mass spectrometry; prediction; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Review; sampling; structure analysis,Elsevier B.V.
Meta-analysis of internal fixation versus hip replacement in the treatment of trochanteric fractures,"Dong J.-B., Wang Z.-Y., Lu H., Tian Y., Wang X.-R., Zhang Z.-Q.",2015,Zhongguo gu shang = China journal of orthopaedics and traumatology,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of internal fixation (including PFNA and PFN) versus hip replacement (including FHR or THA) in the treatment of trochanteric fractures in adults.METHODS: Reports of studies using randomized controlled trials (RCT) to compare internal fixationg with hip replacement in the management of intertrochanteric fractures were retrieved (up to January 1, 2013) from the Cochrane Library, PUBMED Data, CNKI (China National Knowledge infrastructure), Elsevier, the Chinese Biomedical Database, Wanfang Data, and manually. Methodological quality of the trials was critically assessed, and relevant data were extracted. Statistical software RevMan 5.0 was used for data-analysis.RESULTS: Seven articles were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that,compared internal fixation with hip replacement,there were statistical significance in the duration of surgery time [WMD = -2.66, 95% CI (-5.25,-0.06), P = 0.05], intra-operative blood loss [WMD = -24.20, 95% CI (-30.38, -18.02), P < 0.000 01], hospital stays time [WMD = -4.72, 95% CI (-5.18, -4.25), P < 0.000 01], bearing load time [WMD = -29.54, 95% CI (-30.77, -28.31), P < 0.000 01], total complications rate [WMD = 0.15, 95% CI (0.11, 0.22), P < 0.000 01], the good rate of Harris scores [WMD = 1.09, 95% CI (0.54,1.32), P < 0.05]. However, there were no statistical significance in the rate of deep venous thrombosis [WMD = 1.09, 95% CI (0.47, 2.55), P > 0.05]. CON- CLUSION: Hip replacement (containing FHR or THA) for the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures is superior to internal fixa- tion in regards to the duration of surgery time, the mean duration of hosipital stays, mean post-operative down time, intra-opera- tive blood loss, the rate of post-operative good Harris scores. But there is not enough evidence to show any difference between hip replacement (containing THA or FHR) and internal fixation in regards to the rate of deep venous thrombosis. However, internal fixation for the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures is superior to hip replacement (containing FHR or THA) in regards to total complications rate.",,"comparative study; hip arthroplasty; Hip Fractures; human; meta analysis; osteosynthesis; procedures; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Fracture Fixation, Internal; Hip Fractures; Humans",
Role of Occlusive Devices to Prevent Thromboembolism Among Persons With a Patent Foramen Ovale and Prior Stroke,"Roth C., Alli O.",2015,Current Treatment Options in Neurology,"Patent foramen ovale (PFO) has been linked to stroke, presumably through the mechanism of paradoxical embolism; however, data is confusing regarding the causal relationship between PFO and embolic stroke. What has come to light in the past decade of research is that PFO closure with devices that achieve a high rate of closure may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke compared with medical therapy, but this benefit has not been shown in the general population with a PFO and cryptogenic stroke. The important question now is which patient will benefit from PFO closure for stroke risk reduction. A validated risk prediction tool is needed to help physicians determine those patients who will derive benefit from closure of PFO to prevent recurrent stroke. It is clear that even in studies with a small number of individuals and a very small number of events, there is some benefit to closure. Furthermore, improvements in closure devices and techniques have made percutaneous device closure both safe and efficacious. As such, it is not necessary to wait for a patient to have two strokes prior to serious consideration of PFO closure. We would advocate that the decision to close a PFO in the setting of a cryptogenic stroke be made at an individual level, on a case-by-case basis. Patients with high-risk features may be more likely to benefit, though who exactly comprises this population is still being elucidated. The most difficult aspect of managing this disease is the substantial number of individuals with incidental PFOs, as well as the prevalence of stroke due to other etiologies. When treating this disease, the physician must be able to weigh the likelihood of benefit versus the risk of the procedure, as well as patient preference. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cryptogenic stroke, Percutaneous device closure, Paradoxical embolism, Secondary stroke prevention; Patent foramen ovale, PFO",amplatzer pfo occluder; cerebrovascular accident; gore helix device; high risk patient; human; meta analysis; patent foramen ovale; patient preference; pfo occlusion device; physician; prevalence; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent disease; Review; risk reduction; septal occluder; systematic review; thromboembolism; validation study,Current Science Inc.
Advances in transition-metal-mediated Di- and monofluoroalkylations,"Ni C., Zhu L., Hu J.",2015,Acta Chimica Sinica,"Transition-metal-mediated fluoroalkylation is a hot research topic in current organofluorine chemistry. In the past five years, due to the development of new perfluoroalkylation reagents and methodologies, significant progress has been made in the field of transition-metal-mediated perfluoroalkylation. Compared with perfluoroalkylation, di- and monofluoroalkylation can not only introduce fluorine atom(s) into a molecule, but also install a non-fluorinated moiety simultaneously; therefore, in organic synthesis, these reactions are of higher step economy than the direct fluorination reactions. Although analogous to transition-metal-mediated perfluoroalkylations, the di- and monofluoroalkylation have been relatively less developed; therefore, there are still many opportunities for their development. In this review, we have made a survey on transition- metal-mediated di- and monofluoroalkylation reactions that were published in the past nearly 30 years. To our knowledge, this is the first rather comprehensive review on this topic. This review is divided into five sections. The first section is the general introduction on di- and monofluoroalkylation. The second and third sections focus on the historical development of transition-metal-mediated di- and monofluoroalkylation with reagents that contain functional groups. These two sections are subdivided according to the reactions types, that is, fluoroalkylation of unsaturated organohalides, fluoroalkylation of the carbon-hydrogen bonds of unsaturated systems (arenes, alkenes, alkynes, and carbonyl compounds), fluoroalkylation of organoborane reagents and organometallic reagents, fluoroalkyl addition to unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds. The fourth section puts an emphasis on the transition-metal-promoted di- and monofluoromethylation reactions. The final section gives some perspectives on the future development of this chemistry. © 2015 Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences",Difluoroalkylation; Difluoromethylation; Monofluoroalkylation; Monofluoromethylation; Transition-metals,,Science Press
Analysis of several loci from genome-wide association studies in Parkinson's disease in mainland China,"Liu Z.-H., Guo J.-F., Li K., Wang Y.-Q., Kang J.-F., Wei Y., Sun Q.-Y., Xu Q., Wang D.-L., Xia K., Yan X.-X., Xu C.-S., Tang B.-S.",2015,Neuroscience Letters,"Large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) have identified a number of susceptibility loci in sporadic PD. Since the characteristics of those loci in a Han Chinese population from mainland China were unknown, we performed a case-control replication study in this population and evaluated several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in a recent GWAS-meta-analysis. In total, 933 subjects comprised of 460 PD patients and 473 controls were genotyped.

Effects of medium-chain triglycerides on weight loss and body composition: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Mumme K., Stonehouse W.",2015,Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,"Background: Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) may result in negative energy balance and weight loss through increased energy expenditure and lipid oxidation. However, results from human intervention studies investigating the weight reducing potential of MCTs, have been mixed. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of MCTs, specifically C8:0 and C10:0, to long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) on weight loss and body composition in adults. Changes in blood lipid levels were secondary outcomes. Methods: Randomized controlled trials &gt;3 weeks' duration conducted in healthy adults were identified searching Web of Knowledge, Discover, PubMed, Scopus, New Zealand Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL until March 2014 with no language restriction. Identified trials were assessed for bias. Mean differences were pooled and analyzed using inverse variance models with fixed effects. Heterogeneity between studies was calculated using I2 statistic. An I2&gt;50% or P&lt;0.10 indicated heterogeneity. Results: Thirteen trials (n=749) were identified. Compared with LCTs, MCTs decreased body weight (-0.51 kg [95% CI-0.80 to -0.23 kg]; P&lt;0.001; I2=35%); waist circumference (-1.46 cm [95% CI -2.04 to -0.87 cm]; P&lt;0.001; I2=0%), hip circumference (-0.79 cm [95% CI -1.27 to -0.30 cm]; P=0.002; I2=0%), total body fat (standard mean difference -0.39 [95% CI -0.57 to -0.22]; P&lt;0.001; I2=0%), total subcutaneous fat (standard mean difference -0.46 [95% CI -0.64 to -0.27]; P&lt;0.001; I2=20%), and visceral fat (standard mean difference -0.55 [95% CI -0.75 to -0.34]; P&lt;0.001; I2=0%). No differences were seen in blood lipid levels. Many trials lacked sufficient information for a complete quality assessment, and commercial bias was detected. Although heterogeneity was absent, study designs varied with regard to duration, dose, and control of energy intake. Conclusions: Replacement of LCTs with MCTs in the diet could potentially induce modest reductions in body weight and composition without adversely affecting lipid profiles. However, further research is required by independent research groups using large, well-designed studies to confirm the efficacy of MCT and to determine the dosage needed for the management of a healthy body weight and composition. © 2015 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.",Blood lipids; Body composition; Body weight; Medium-chain triglycerides; Obesity,"Scopus; triacylglycerol; body composition; caloric intake; drug effects; energy metabolism; factual database; human; lipid metabolism; meta analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); waist circumference; weight reduction; Body Composition; Databases, Factual; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Triglycerides; Waist Circumference; Weight Loss",Elsevier B.V.
What is the effect of phasing out long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances on the concentrations of perfluoroalkyl acids and their precursors in the environment? A systematic review protocol,"Land M., De Wit C.A., Cousins I.T., Herzke D., Johansson J., Martin J.W.",2015,Environmental Evidence,"Background: There is a growing concern in Sweden and elsewhere that continued emissions of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may cause environmental as well as human health effects. PFASs are a broad class of man-made substances that have been produced and used in both commercial products and industrial processes for more than 60 years. Although the production and use of some PFASs has been phased-out in some parts of the world, it is not known what effect these actions to date have had on PFAS concentrations in the environment. Owing to the wide diversity of PFASs, it is difficult to generalize their properties, environmental fate and production histories. However, the strength and stability of the C-F bond renders the perfluoroalkyl moieties resistant to heat and environmental degradation. Several PFASs are now occurring even in very remote areas in large parts of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of substances within this group is not well understood. A systematic review may be able to determine whether the concentrations of these substances in different environments are changing in any particular direction with time, and whether the phase-outs have had any effects on the concentration trends. Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations in the environment will be performed in the scientific literature as well as in other reports. Relevant samples include both abiotic and biological samples including humans. No particular time, document type, language or geographical constraints will be applied. Two authors will screen all retrieved articles. Double screening of about 10% of the articles will be performed by all authors at both title/abstract and full-text levels. Kappa tests will be used to test if the screening is consistent. Relevant articles will be critically appraised by four authors (double checking of 25% of the articles). Quality assessment will focus on selection bias, dating of samples, sample integrity and analytical procedures. Data synthesis will be based on statistical analysis of temporal concentration trends. © 2015 Land et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",Concentration; Emission; Environmental fate; Perfluoroalkane acids; Perfluoroalkyl acids; PFOA; PFOS; Phase-out; Regulation; Source; Temporal trends,,BioMed Central Ltd.
LC-MS analysis of the plasma metabolome-A novel sample preparation strategy,"Skov K., Hadrup N., Smedsgaard J., Frandsen H.",2015,Journal of Chromatography B: Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical and Life Sciences,"Blood plasma is a well-known body fluid often analyzed in studies on the effects of toxic compounds as physiological or chemical induced changes in the mammalian body are reflected in the plasma metabolome. Sample preparation prior to LC-MS based analysis of the plasma metabolome is a challenge as plasma contains compounds with very different properties. Besides, proteins, which usually are precipitated with organic solvent, phospholipids, are known to cause ion suppression in electrospray mass spectrometry.We have compared two different sample preparation techniques prior to LC-qTOF analysis of plasma samples: the first is protein precipitation; the second is protein precipitation followed by solid phase extraction with sub-fractionation into three sub-samples: a phospholipid, a lipid and a polar sub-fraction. Molecular feature extraction of the data files from LC-qTOF analysis of the samples revealed 1792 molecular features from the protein precipitation procedure. The protein precipitation followed by solid phase extraction procedure with three sub-samples gave a total of 4234 molecular features. This suggests that sub-sampling into polar, lipid and phospholipid fractions enables extraction of more metabolomic information as compared to protein precipitation alone. Chromatography showed good separation of the metabolites with little retention time drift (<1. s) and a mass accuracy below 3. ppm was observed. The performance of the method was investigated using plasma samples from rats administered the environmental pollutant perfluorononanoic acid. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",LC-MS; Metabolomics; Plasma samples; Solid phase extraction,"Blood; Chromatography; Mammals; Metabolites; Phase separation; Phospholipids; Proteins; Environmental pollutants; LC-MS; Metabolomics; Perfluorononanoic acids; Plasma samples; Protein precipitation; Sample preparation techniques; Solid-phase extraction; Extraction; organic solvent; perfluorononanoic acid; phospholipid; biological marker; animal experiment; Article; chemometric analysis; chromatograph; comparative study; controlled study; electrospray mass spectrometry; high performance liquid chromatography; ionization; liquid chromatography; male; mass spectrometry; metabolome; nonhuman; plasma; plasma metabolome; rat; solid phase extraction; time of flight mass spectrometry; animal; blood; chemistry; liquid chromatography; metabolome; metabolomics; physiology; procedures; Wistar rat; Mammalia; Rattus; Animals; Biomarkers; Chromatography, Liquid; Male; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Solid Phase Extraction; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization",Elsevier B.V.

The project aims to deliver a conceptual framework to support the evidence-based development of environmental policies with regard to water quality. SOLUTIONS will develop the tools for the identification, prioritisation and assessment of those water contaminants that may pose a risk to ecosystems and human health. To this end, a new generation of chemical and effect-based monitoring tools is developed and integrated with a full set of exposure, effect and risk assessment models. SOLUTIONS attempts to address legacy, present and future contamination by integrating monitoring and modelling based approaches with scenarios on future developments in society, economy and technology and thus in contamination. The project follows a solutions-oriented approach by addressing major problems of water and chemicals management and by assessing abatement options. SOLUTIONS takes advantage of the access to the infrastructure necessary to investigate the large basins of the Danube and Rhine as well as relevant Mediterranean basins as case studies, and puts major efforts on stakeholder dialogue and support. Particularly, the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) Common Implementation Strategy (CIS) working groups, International River Commissions, and water works associations are directly supported with consistent guidance for the early detection, identification, prioritisation, and abatement of chemicals in the water cycle. SOLUTIONS will give a specific emphasis on concepts and tools for the impact and risk assessment of complex mixtures of emerging pollutants, their metabolites and transformation products. Analytical and effect-based screening tools will be applied together with ecological assessment tools for the identification of toxicants and their impacts. The SOLUTIONS approach is expected to provide transparent and evidence-based candidates or River Basin Specific Pollutants in the case study basins and to assist future review of priority pollutants under the WFD as well as potential abatement options. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Effect-based tools; Environmental risk assessment; Exposure and risk modelling; Mixture toxicology; Water Framework Directive; Water policy,"Environmental risk assessment; Mixture toxicologies; Risk modelling; Water Framework Directives; Water policies; drinking water; dangerous goods; water pollutant; conceptual framework; environmental policy; environmental risk; European Union; pollution exposure; risk assessment; soil pollution; toxicology; water management; water pollution; water quality; aquatic environment; Article; effluent; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; health hazard; risk assessment; waste component removal; waste water management; water contamination; water cycle; water pollution; water quality; water supply; analysis; dangerous goods; ecosystem; environmental planning; environmental protection; European Union; prevention and control; procedures; statistics and numerical data; water pollutant; water pollution; Danube Basin; Rhine Basin; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Policy; European Union; Hazardous Substances; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical; Water Resources",Elsevier
"Systematic Review, An Illustration of Increased Transparency in a Framework for Evaluating Immunotoxicity Associated with PFOA and PFOS Exposure","Rooney A.A., Boyles A.L., Walker V.R.",2015,Molecular and Integrative Toxicology,"Background: Systematic review methodologies were first developed to assess the efficacy of health care interventions, but these approaches can be adapted to evaluations of environmental health questions such as immunotoxicity associated with PFOA and PFOS exposure. This structured approach provides objectivity and transparency to the process of collecting, synthesizing, and reaching conclusions based on the scientific evidence available. Objectives: To outline the process of systematic review and evidence integration and demonstrate each step by following a single research question from start to finish. The example systematic review will evaluate the evidence that PFOA and PFOS exposure are associated with immunotoxicity – using a subset of the available evidence to illustrate concepts, not to develop hazard identification conclusions. Methods: The Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Approach to evaluating the scientific evidence for immunotoxicity of PFOA and PFOS is detailed in a protocol that is laid out in seven steps: scoping and problem formulation, search for and select studies for inclusion, extract data from studies, assess quality of individual studies, rate confidence in the body of evidence, translate confidence ratings into level of evidence, and integrate evidence to develop hazard identification conclusions incorporating human, animal, and mechanistic evidence. Results and Discussion: Eligibility criteria for identifying important exposures and outcomes were presented as the basis for assembling the relevant studies for evaluating whether or not PFOA or PFOS exposure is associated with immunotoxicity (human, n = 18; animal, n = 80; and mechanistic/in vitro assays, n = 19). A tool for assessing study quality in terms of risk of bias or internal validity was tailored to the research question – particularly for evaluating PFC exposure and assessing immunological outcomes. An example of an evidence profile is provided to illustrate the basis for confidence ratings using a hypothetical set of studies of PFOS and functional antibody response. Finally, a discussion is presented on how the hazard identification conclusions would be reached and interpreted by integrating the human, animal, and mechanistic evidence. Conclusion: The OHAT Approach to hazard identification of health effects of PFCs is illustrated with a case study on PFOA/PFOS and immunotoxicity. Communication of the evaluation process is enhanced by using objective, reproducible methods that transparently document scientific judgments and the scientific basis for hazard identification conclusions. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Hazard identification; Immunotoxicity; Perfluorinated chemicals; PFOA; PFOS; Risk of bias; Systematic review,,Springer Science+Business Media B.V.
A meta-analysis of fast track surgery for patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy,"Chen S., Zou Z., Chen F., Huang Z., Li G.",2015,Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,"Introduction: This meta-analysis evaluated the safety and efficacy of fast track surgery (FTS) for patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy. Methods: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1 January 1995 and 21 June 2013 comparing FTS with conventional perioperative care for patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy were identified in the PubMed, Embase™ and Cochrane Library databases, and were analysed systematically using RevMan software (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Results: Seven RCTs (524 patients) were analysed. Compared with conventional perioperative care, FTS treatment with/without laparoscopy was associated with shorter postoperative hospitalisation, less hospitalisation expenditure (both p<0.00001), less pain and better quality of life. Short-term morbidity and readmission rates did not differ between treatments. No incidents of death occurred during the short-term follow-up period. Conclusions: In patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy, the FTS pathway reduces the length and cost of postoperative hospitalisation while maintaining short-term morbidity, readmission and mortality rates comparable with those of conventional care.",Fast track surgery; Gastrectomy; Gastric cancer; Meta-analysis,gastrectomy; hospital mortality; hospitalization; human; laparoscopy; meta analysis; statistics and numerical data; Stomach Neoplasms; time factor; Gastrectomy; Hospital Mortality; Hospitalization; Humans; Laparoscopy; Stomach Neoplasms; Time Factors,Royal College of Surgeons of England
Tracking humanitarian funding for reproductive health: A systematic analysis of health and protection proposals from 2002-2013,"Tanabe M., Schaus K., Rastogi S., Krause S.K., Patel P.",2015,Conflict and Health,"Background: The Inter-Agency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crises conducted a ten-year global evaluation of reproductive health in humanitarian settings. This paper examines proposals for reproductive health activities under humanitarian health and protection funding mechanisms for 2002-2013, and the level at which these reproductive health proposals were funded. Methods: The study used English and French health and protection proposal data for 2002-2013, extracted from the Financial Tracking Service (FTS) database managed by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Every project was reviewed for relevance against pre-determined reproductive health definitions for 2002-2008. An in-depth analysis was additionally conducted for 2009-2013 through systematically reviewing proposals via a key word search and subsequently classifying them under designated reproductive health categories. Among the relevant reproductive health proposals, counts and proportions were calculated in Excel based on their reproductive health components, primarily by year. Contributions, requests, and unfunded requests were calculated based on the data provided by FTS. Results: Among the 11,347 health and protection proposals issued from 345 emergencies between 2002 and 2013, 3,912 were relevant to reproductive health (34.5%). The number of proposals containing reproductive health activities increased by an average of 21.9% per year, while the proportion of health and protection sector appeals containing reproductive health activities increased by an average of 10.1% per year. The total funding request over the 12 years amounted to $4.720 billion USD, of which $2.031 billion USD was received. Among reproductive health components for 2009-2013 proposals, maternal newborn health comprised the largest proportion (56.4%), followed by reproductive health-related gender-based violence (45.9%), HIV/sexually transmitted infections (37.5%), general reproductive health (26.2%), and lastly, family planning (14.9%). Conclusion: Findings show that more agencies are responding to humanitarian appeals by proposing to implement reproductive health programs and receiving increased aid over the twelve year period. While such developments are welcome, project descriptions show comparatively limited attention and programming for family planning and abortion care in particular. © 2015 Tanabe et al.",,,BioMed Central Ltd.
Environmental chemicals and DNA methylation in adults: A systematic review of the epidemiologic evidence,"Ruiz-Hernandez A., Kuo C.-C., Rentero-Garrido P., Tang W.-Y., Redon J., Ordovas J.M., Navas-Acien A., Tellez-Plaza M.",2015,Clinical Epigenetics,"Current evidence supports the notion that environmental exposures are associated with DNA-methylation and expression changes that can impact human health. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of epidemiologic studies evaluating the association between environmental chemicals with DNA methylation levels in adults. After excluding arsenic, recently evaluated in a systematic review, we identified a total of 17 articles (6 on cadmium, 4 on lead, 2 on mercury, 1 on nickel, 1 on antimony, 1 on tungsten, 5 on persistent organic pollutants and perfluorinated compounds, 1 on bisphenol A, and 3 on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). The selected articles reported quantitative methods to determine DNA methylation including immunocolorimetric assays for total content of genomic DNA methylation, and microarray technologies, methylation-specific quantitative PCR, Luminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA), and bisulfite pyrosequencing for DNA methylation content of genomic sites such as gene promoters, LINE-1, Alu elements, and others. Considering consistency, temporality, strength, dose-response relationship, and biological plausibility, we concluded that the current evidence is not sufficient to provide inference because differences across studies and limited samples sizes make it difficult to compare across studies and to evaluate sources of heterogeneity. Important questions for future research include the need for larger and longitudinal studies, the validation of findings, and the systematic evaluation of the dose-response relationships. Future studies should also consider the evaluation of epigenetic marks recently in the research spotlight such as DNA hydroxymethylation and the role of underlying genetic variants. © 2015 Ruiz-Hernandez et al.",Bisphenol A; Cadmium; DNA methylation; Environmental chemicals; Lead; Mercury; Metals; Persistent organic pollutants; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Systematic review,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; antimony; arsenic; bisulfite; cadmium; DNA; environmental chemical; fluorocarbon; genomic DNA; lead; mercury; nickel; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; tungsten; adult; colorimetry; DNA methylation; environmental exposure; epigenetics; genetic variability; human; limit of detection; longitudinal study; microarray analysis; pathogenesis; persistent organic pollutant; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; promoter region; pyrosequencing; quantitative analysis; Review; sample size; systematic review; validation process",Springer Verlag
A kinetic insight into the activation of n-octane with alkaline-earth metal hydroxyapatites,"Dasireddy V.D.B.C., Friedrich H.B., Singh S.",2015,South African Journal of Chemistry,"Alkaline-earth metal hydroxyapatites are prepared by the co-precipitation method and characterized using XRD, ICP, NH3-TPD, SEM-EDX, TEM and N2 physisorption analysis. The metal present in the hydroxyapatite influences the acidity of the catalyst. Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions carried out in a continuous flow fixed bed reactor showed that the selectivity towards desired products was dependent on the alkaline-earth metal in the hydroxyapatite. All hydroxyapatite catalysts showed high selectivity towards carbon oxides, followed by cracked products, octenes and aromatics. The highest selectivity and turnover numbers towards C8 products and a high specific rate was shown by Sr-HAp. The activation of n-octane over these catalysts followed the Eley-Rideal mechanism. ©2015 South African Chemical Institute.",Acidity; Aromatics; Chemisorption; Hydroxyapatite; N-octane; Octenes; Oxidative dehydrogenation,,South African Bureau for Scientific Publications
Speciation analysis of selenium in human urine by liquid chromatography and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for monitoring of selenium in body fluids,"Eichler Š., Kaňa A., Kalousová M., Vosmanská M., Korotvička M., Zima T., Mestek O.",2015,Chemical Speciation and Bioavailability,"Speciation analysis of selenium metabolites in urine was performed using hyphenation of mixed ion-pair reversed-phase chromatography and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. A chromatographic separation was performed with a C8 stationary phase and a mobile phase containing 2.5 mmol L-1 sodium butane-1-sulfonate, 8 mmol L-1 tetramethylammonium hydroxide, 4 mmol L-1 malonic acid, and 0.05% methanol, pH 3.0. Under this condition, the selenium species selenite, selenate, selenomethionine, selenoethionine, selenourea, trimethylselenonium, and Se-methylselenocysteine were successfully separated. Selenium determination was carried out by monitoring 80Se. The internal standard Ge was added into the mobile phase. The calibration was linear at least up to 100 μg L-1 Se for all species. The limit of detection was 0.4 μg L-1 Se. When higher (1400 W) ICP power was applied, the calibration based solely on selenate provided accurate results for all species. Stability tests revealed extremely short stability of selenite. After collection, the urine samples should be acidified to pH 3.0, stored below –5 °C, and analyzed before 12 h after collection. The method was used for the short-time (single capsule, one day observation, 5 persons) monitoring of the excretion of selenium after ingestion of Se-containing dietary supplements. When a formulation containing selenate was applied, almost 50% of Se was excreted during 24 h (mostly in the unchanged form of selenate) and the plasma Se remained unaltered. In the case of organically bound Se, only 8% of Se was lost by urination during 24 h as selenite, Se-methylselenocysteine, selenomethionine, and unknown species. Subsequently, a statistically significant increase of plasma Se was observed. © 2015 The Author(s). Published by Taylor & Francis.",Calibration; Selenium; Speciation; Urine,,Taylor and Francis Ltd.
The diagnosis and treatment of vesicoureteral reflux: An update,"Rensing A., Austin P.",2015,Open Urology and Nephrology Journal,"Vesicoureteral reflux [VUR] remains a common problem seen by pediatric providers. Despite a great deal of research, the debate regarding how to screen and treat patients reremains tense and controversial. This review seeks to summarize the management of VUR with emphasis on recent published findings in the literature and how they contribute to this debate. The goals of managing VUR include preventing future febrile urinary tract infections [FUTI], renal scarring, reflux nephropathy and hypertension. The topdown approach with upper tract imaging and selective vesicocystourethrogram [VCUG] is an emerging alternative approach in the evaluation of children after their first FUTI. The elimination of bladder and bowel dysfunction [BBD] is an important management strategy to prevent further FUTIs, regardless of treatment choice. Antibiotic prophylaxis is a safe and effective modality to sterilize the urinary tract. Endoscopic treatment of VUR is an attractive modality in select patients, although some concerns remain regarding its effectiveness and durability as compared to the gold standard of open or laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy. Lastly, further research is required to determine the most effective algorithm to evaluate the pediatric patient after the first febrile UTI. © Rensing and Austin.",Antibiotic prophylaxis; Bladder and bowel dysfunction; Dysfunctional voiding; Lower urinary tract dysfunction; Pyelonephritis renal scarring; Ureteral reimplantation; Urinary tract infection; Vesicoureteral reflux,antibiotic agent; politef; anti vesicoureteral reflux gel; antibiotic prophylaxis; bladder dysfunction; clinical trial (topic); drug efficacy; Escherichia coli; familial disease; human; hypertension; intestine function disorder; kidney scar; laparoscopic surgery; meta analysis (topic); micturition cystourethrography; multicenter study (topic); nonhuman; practice guideline; priority journal; pyelonephritis; randomized controlled trial (topic); reflux nephropathy; Review; sibling; ureter reimplantation; ureteroneocystostomy; urinary tract infection; vesicoureteral reflux,Bentham Science Publishers
The assessment of the quality of the marine environment and marine mollusks according to the directive 2006/113 EC,"Rosioru D.M., Lazar L., Oros A., Coatu V., Stoica E.",2015,"International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM","The assessment of the quality of the marine environment and marine mollusks was carried-out in 2013 in the four designated areas for the growth and commercial exploitation in the Romanian Black Sea coast, according to the Directive 2006/113 EC. Physical, chemical and biological factors of the marine environment, water and sediment in living mollusks (water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, total hydrocarbons, organohalogenated substances-pesticides, heavy metals, faecal coliforms) were analysed by the analytical methods set out in Annex to Directive No 2006/113/EC and Government Order No 201/2002. The main species monitored were the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the rapa welk Rapana venosa. Total suspended solids had overall low values without impact on water quality. Water temperature was not influenced by point discharges. Salinity evinced values below the minimum recommended threshold of 12‰ in all areas. Dissolved oxygen filled well to the requirements in all areas (100%). The presence of petroleum hydrocarbons films was visually assessed, but was not reported within the investigated areas. Organohalogenated substances (pesticides) were identified both in water and sediments but within concentrations allowed by Ministerial Order No 1888/2007. Heavy metals concentration in seawater, except Ni (80% compliance) in area 3 and Cr in area 4 (90% compliance) was according to the requirements. Overall organohalogenated substances and heavy metals contamination was extremely low and their concentration in mollusks meat did not present a threat for human consumption. Faecal coliforms were present in mollusks at concentrations below the threshold. © SGEM2015.",Directive 2006/113 EC; Marine environment quality; Mollusks,Biochemical oxygen demand; Chemical analysis; Dissolved oxygen; Heavy metals; Hydrocarbons; Molluscs; Nobelium; Pesticides; Petroleum chemistry; Temperature; Water pollution; Water quality; Chemical and biologicals; Commercial exploitation; Directive 2006/113 EC; Marine environment; Mollusks; Mytilus galloprovincialis; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Total suspended solids; Chemical contamination,International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference
Energy efficiency in capital projects,Rossiter A.,2015,"American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, AFPM - AFPM Annual Meeting 2015","The best economics for energy efficiency improvements occur in new plant designs and major plant expansions. Basic technology selection, heat integration, specifications for equipment items such as high-efficiency motors, pumps and compressors, control schemes, insulation, and utility plant choices can all have a major impact on energy performance. Unfortunately, many opportunities to achieve these benefits are lost because of pressure to minimize investment and concerns about project schedule. Energy efficiency workshops and process flow diagram (PFD) reviews are very effective procedures for identifying the energy-efficiency issues in any given design and identifying improvements. An energy efficiency workshop, in its simplest form, is a review of standard features that can be incorporated into a design to enhance energy performance. The review highlights the elements that have been incorporated in a preliminary design and reveals opportunities that have been left on the table. Process flow diagram (PFD) reviews provide a very down-to-earth and practical approach to the problem of finding more specific energy efficiency improvement opportunities. Preliminary PFDs are available early in the life of most projects. The review consists of a systematic evaluation of the PFD documents, combined with structured brainstorming. Typical results from PFD reviews include process improvements ranging from simple piping modifications and changes in control philosophy to equipment upgrades and major design changes. This paper discusses the use of these simple tools to improve project economics. Case studies are presented to illustrate the types of opportunities that are typically identified.",,Design; Economics; Efficiency; Flowcharting; Investments; Plant expansion; Energy efficiency improvements; Energy performance; High efficiency motors; Preliminary design; Process flow diagrams; Process Improvement; Systematic evaluation; Technology selection; Energy efficiency,American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM)

Histopathology and contaminant concentrations in fish from Kuwait's marine environment,"Al-Zaidan A.S., Al-Sarawi H.A., Massoud M.S., Al-Enezi M., Smith A.J., Bignell J.P., Green M.J., Askem C., Bolam T.P.C., Barber J.L., Bersuder P., Lyons B.P.",2015,Marine Pollution Bulletin,"Kuwait has witnessed major socioeconomic and industrial development in recent decades. Consequently, a variety of contaminants related to these activities have been discharged directly into the marine environment. This paper describes the application of a histopathology baseline survey in two potential sentinel species, the Giant sea catfish (Arius thalassinus) and the Fourlined terapon (Pelates quadrilineatus) to assess the health of biota inhabiting Kuwait's marine environment. Histological analysis revealed several lesion types in both species, although the prevalence was generally considered low with no discernible differences between sampling locations. The analysis of contaminant burdens (metals, PCBs, PBDEs, HBCDD) in A. thalassinus, along with the analysis of bile for PAH metabolites in both species, indicated that levels of contaminant exposure was low. Overall the data show that both species appear to be susceptible to pathologies associated with environmental contaminants and therefore suitable for further investigation as sentinel organisms for biological effects monitoring. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Biomarkers; Contaminants; Fish health; Histopathology; Kuwait,"Biomarkers; Contamination; Fish; Impurities; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Contaminant concentrations; Contaminant exposure; Environmental contaminant; Fish healths; Histological analysis; Histopathology; Industrial development; Kuwait; Marine pollution; organohalogen derivative; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; diphenyl ether derivative; metal; polychlorinated biphenyl; water pollutant; bioaccumulation; biomarker; biomonitoring; fish; histopathology; marine environment; marine pollution; metabolite; pollution exposure; animal experiment; animal health; Arius thalassinus; Article; biota; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; fish; histopathology; Kuwait; marine environment; nonhuman; Pelates quadrilineatus; prevalence; water contamination; water pollutant; analysis; animal; bile; catfish; chemistry; ecotoxicology; liver; metabolism; pathology; pharmacokinetics; procedures; questionnaire; tissue distribution; water pollutant; Kuwait [Middle East]; Ariidae; Arius; Pelates quadrilineatus; Terapon; Animals; Bile; Catfishes; Ecotoxicology; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Kuwait; Liver; Metals; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tissue Distribution; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Elsevier Ltd
MicroRNAs as potential signatures of environmental exposure or effect: A systematic review,"Vrijens K., Bollati V., Nawrot T.S.",2015,Environmental Health Perspectives,"Background: The exposome encompasses all life-course environmental exposures from the prenatal period onward that influence health. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are interesting entities within this concept as markers and causation of disease. MicroRNAs are short oligonucleotide sequences that can interact with several mRNA targets. Objectives: We reviewed the current state of the field on the potential of using miRNAs as biomarkers for environmental exposure. We investigated miRNA signatures in response to all types of environmental exposure to which a human can be exposed, including cigarette smoke, air pollution, nanoparticles, and diverse chemicals; and we examined the health conditions for which the identified miRNAs have been reported (i.e., cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes). Methods: We searched the PubMed and ScienceDirect databases to identify relevant studies. Results: For all exposures incorporated in this review, 27 miRNAs were differentially expressed in at least two independent studies. miRNAs that had expression alterations associated with smoking observed in multiple studies are miR‑21, miR‑34b, miR‑125b, miR‑146a, miR‑223, and miR‑340; and those miRNAs that were observed in multiple air pollution studies are miR‑9, miR‑10b, miR‑21, miR‑128, miR‑143, miR‑155, miR‑222, miR‑223, and miR‑338. We found little overlap among in vitro, in vivo, and human studies between miRNAs and exposure. Here, we report on disease associations for those miRNAs identified in multiple studies on exposure. Conclusions: miRNA changes may be sensitive indicators of the effects of acute and chronic environmental exposure. Therefore, miRNAs are valuable novel biomarkers for exposure. Further studies should elucidate the role of the mediation effect of miRNA between exposures and effect through all stages of life to pprovide a more accurate assessment of the consequences of miRNA changes. © 2015, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Meta- Analysis of contrast-enhanced ultrasound for the differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions,"Hu Q., Wang X.Y., Zhu S.Y., Kang L.K., Xiao Y.J., Zheng H.Y.",2015,Acta Radiologica,"Background: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a non-invasive method for the assessment of breast lesions. The accuracy of CEUS in diagnosing of breast cancer has never been systematically assessed. Purpose: To determine the overall performance of CEUS in the differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions using meta- Analysis. Material and Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and article references published before October 2012 were searched. Published studies that used histopathologic results as golden reference to assess the diagnostic performance of CEUS in patients suspected of having breast cancer and the data necessary to calculate the diagnostic results were included. The qualities of eligible studies for final meta- Analysis were assessed by using the quality assessment of diagnostic studies (QUADAS) instrument. Sensitivity, specificity, summary receiver-operating characteristic (sROC) curves, and area under the curve were calculated to examine the diagnostic performance of CEUS. Results: Of 16 eligible studies, 957 breast lesions were included in the original meta- Analysis, among which heterogeneity arising from factors other than threshold effect was explored. Meta-regression analysis confirmed the contrast agent was the most significant factor cause of heterogeneity (P=0.0012, relative diagnostic odds ratio [DOR]=7.06). The use of perfluoro containing microbubbles (Sonovue or Optison) significantly increased the diagnostic precision compared with Levovist. The pooled weighted estimates of sensitivity and specificity for CEUS in the diagnosis of breast lesions were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83, 0.89) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75, 0.83), respectively. Conclusion: CEUS has good sensitivity and specificity in the characterization of breast lesions and can potentially help to select suspicious breast mass for surgery. © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2014.",Breast cancer; Contrast-enhanced ultrasound; Diagnostic performance; Heterogeneity; Publication bias; Subgroup analysis,"Diseases; Factor analysis; Mammography; Noninvasive medical procedures; Regression analysis; Ultrasonics; Breast Cancer; Contrast enhanced ultrasound; Diagnostic performance; Heterogeneity; Publication bias; Subgroup analysis; Quality control; perflutren; shu 508; sonovue; contrast medium; Article; breast cancer; breast carcinoma; breast lesion; breast tumor; colloid carcinoma; contrast enhanced ultrasound; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; echography; human; intraductal carcinoma; medullary carcinoma; meta analysis; microbubble; papillary carcinoma; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; adolescent; adult; aged; Breast Neoplasms; classification; diagnostic use; differential diagnosis; echography; female; middle aged; observer variation; prevalence; reproducibility; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Breast Neoplasms; Contrast Media; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Prevalence; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity; Ultrasonography; Young Adult",SAGE Publications Ltd
New developments in the extraction and determination of parabens in cosmetics and environmental samples. A review,"Ocaña-González J.A., Villar-Navarro M., Ramos-Payán M., Fernández-Torres R., Bello-López M.A.",2015,Analytica Chimica Acta,"Parabens are a family of synthetic esters of p-hydroxibenzoic acid widely used as preservatives in cosmetics and health-care products, among other daily-use commodities. Recently, their potential endocrine disrupting effects have raised concerns about their safety and their potential effects as emerging pollutants, leading to the regulation of the presence of parabens in commercial products by national and trans-national organizations. Also, this has led to an interest in developing sensible and reliable methods for their determination in environmental samples, cosmetics and health-care products. This paper is a comprehensive up-to-date review of the literature concerning the determination of parabens in environmental samples and cosmetic and health-care products. A brief revision of the literature concerning the traditional determination of parabens (1980-2003) is included, followed by an in-depth revision of the recent developments in both measurement and extraction methods for parabens in the last years (2003-2013).

Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and human fetal growth: A systematic review,"Bach C.C., Bech B.H., Brix N., Nohr E.A., Bonde J.P.E., Henriksen T.B.",2015,Critical Reviews in Toxicology,"Background: Exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) is ubiquitous in most regions of the world. The most commonly studied PFASs are perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Animal studies indicate that maternal PFAS exposure is associated with reduced fetal growth. However, the results of human studies are inconsistent. Objectives: To summarize the evidence of an association between exposure to PFASs, particularly PFOS and PFOA, and human fetal growth. Methods: Systematic literature searches were performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE. We included original studies on pregnant women with measurements of PFOA or PFOS in maternal blood during pregnancy or the umbilical cord and associations with birth weight or related outcomes according to the PFAS level. Citations and references from the included articles were investigated to locate more relevant articles. Study characteristics and results were extracted to structured tables. The completeness of reporting as well as the risk of bias and confounding were assessed. Results: Fourteen studies were eligible. In utero PFOA exposure was associated with decreased measures of continuous birth weight in all studies, even though the magnitude of the association differed and many results were statistically insignificant. PFOS exposure and birth weight were associated in some studies, while others found no association. Conclusions: Higher PFOS and PFOA concentrations were associated with decreased average birth weight in most studies, but only some results were statistically significant. The impact on public health is unclear, but the global exposure to PFASs warrants further investigation. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",Birth weight; Epidemiology; Humans; Perfluorinated chemicals; Perfluoroalkyl acids; Perfluorooctane sulfonate; Perfluorooctanoate; Small for gestational age,perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pollutant; birth weight; cord serum; environmental exposure; fetus growth; gestational age; human; low birth weight; maternal blood; outcome assessment; pregnant woman; Review; small for date infant; umbilical cord; adverse effects; animal; drug effects; female; fetus development; pollutant; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; toxicity; Animalia; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Birth Weight; Caprylates; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fetal Development; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome,Informa Healthcare
Long lasting perfume e A review of synthetic musks in WWTPs,"Homem V., Silva J.A., Ratola N., Santos L., Alves A.",2015,Journal of Environmental Management,"Synthetic musks have been used for a long time in personal care and household products. In recent years, this continuous input has increased considerably, to the point that they were recognized as emerging pollutants by the scientific community, due to their persistence in the environment, and hazardous potential to ecosystems even at low concentrations. The number of studies in literature describing their worldwide presence in several environmental matrices is growing, and many of them indicate that the techniques employed for their safe removal tend to be ineffective. This is the case of conventional activated sludge treatment plants (WWTPs), where considerable loads of synthetic musks enter mainly through domestic sewage. This review paper compiles and discusses the occurrence of these compounds in the sewage, effluents and sludge, main concentration levels and phase distributions, as well as the efficiency of the different methodologies of removal applied in these treatment facilities. To the present day, it has been demonstrated that WWTPs lack the ability to remove musks completely. This shows a clear need to develop new effective and cost-efficient remediation approaches and foresees potential for further improvements in this field. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Removal efficiency; Synthetic musks; Wastewater treatment plants,"musk; perfume; acetyl methyl tetramethyl tetralin; benzopyran derivative; galaxolide; perfume; sewage; tetralin derivative; water pollutant; activated sludge; cost-benefit analysis; effluent; persistence; pollutant removal; sewage treatment; activated sludge; biodegradation; human; hydrophilicity; hydroxylation; microbial degradation; photodegradation; Review; sewage treatment plant; systematic review; waste water treatment plant; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; procedures; sewage; statistics and numerical data; water management; water pollutant; Benzopyrans; Environmental Monitoring; Perfume; Sewage; Tetrahydronaphthalenes; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Academic Press
Metabonomic study of biochemical changes in urinary of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients after the treatment of sulfonylurea antidiabetic drugs based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry,"Huo T., Xiong Z., Lu X., Cai S.",2015,Biomedical Chromatography,"A metabonomic study on biochemical changes in the urine of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients after the treatment of sulfonylurea (SU) antidiabetic drugs was performed. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS) method was used to generate metabolic fingerprints for the metabonomic analysis of urinary samples obtained from 20 T2DM patients without any drug treatment and 20 T2DM patients treated with SU antidiabetic drugs and 20 normal glucose tolerance subjects. The resulting data were subjected to chemometric analysis (principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis) to investigate the effect of SU antidiabetic drugs on urinary metabolite profiles of T2DM patients. Biomarkers such as xanthine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, hippurate, phenylacetylglutamine, carnitine C8:1, carnitine C10:3, uric acid and citrate were found to be responsible for the separation of T2DM and SU-treated groups, which indicates a potential effect of SU on energy metabolism, Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, gut microflora metabolism and oxidative stress.

Formation mechanisms of trichloromethyl-containing compounds in the terrestrial environment: A critical review,"Breider F., Albers C.N.",2015,Chemosphere,Natural trichloromethyl compounds present in the terrestrial environment are important contributors to chlorine in the lower atmosphere and may be also a cause for concern when high concentrations are detected in soils and groundwater. During the last decade our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the formation of these compounds has grown. This critical review summarizes our current understanding and uncertainties on the mechanisms leading to the formation of natural trichloromethyl compounds. The objective of the review is to gather information regarding the natural processes that lead to the formation of trichloromethyl compounds and then to compare these mechanisms with the much more comprehensive literature on the reactions occurring during chemical chlorination of organic material. It turns out that the reaction mechanisms during chemical chlorination are likely to be similar to those occurring naturally and that significant knowledge may therefore be transferred between the scientific disciplines of chemical chlorination and natural organohalogens. There is however still a need for additional research before we understand fully the mechanisms occurring during the formation of natural trichloromethyl compounds and open questions and future research needs are identified in the last part of the review. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.,Chlorination; Chloroperoxidase; Halogenase; Trichloroacetic acid; Trichloromethane; Trichloromethyl compounds,"Groundwater; Trichloroacetic acid; Chloroperoxidase; Formation mechanism; Halogenase; Natural organohalogens; Scientific discipline; Terrestrial environments; Trichloromethane; Trichloromethyl compounds; Chlorination; chloride peroxidase; chloroform; halide; heme; natural organic matter; quercetin; trichloroacetic acid; vanadic acid; chlorinated hydrocarbon; soil pollutant; atmospheric chemistry; chlorination; concentration (composition); organohalogen; reaction kinetics; terrestrial ecosystem; uncertainty analysis; chemical reaction; chlorination; decarboxylation; degradation; environment; forest; halogenation; hydrolysis; isotope analysis; oxidation reduction potential; precursor; Review; terrestrial environment; chemistry; soil pollutant; Halogenation; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Soil Pollutants",Elsevier Ltd
The diverse application of laser hair removal therapy: a tertiary laser unit's experience with less common indications and a literature overview,"Koch D., Pratsou P., Szczecinska W., Lanigan S., Abdullah A.",2015,Lasers in Medical Science,"We describe the diversity of indications for laser hair removal (LHR) therapy and compare our experience with the literature. Patients' case notes referred to the Birmingham Regional Skin Laser Centre between 2003 and 2011 for laser hair removal, with indications other than hirsutism, were reviewed retrospectively. Thirty-one treated patients with the following indications were identified: hair-bearing skin grafts/flaps, intra-oral hair-bearing flap, Becker's naevus, localised nevoid hypertrichosis, peristomal hair-bearing skin, scrotal skin prior to vaginoplasty in male-to-female (MTF) gender reassignment, pilonidal sinus disease (PSD), pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Seven patients with the following indications have been reported before: intra-oral hair-bearing graft, naevoid hypertrichosis and peristomal hair-bearing skin. A clinical review of the evidence available for each indication is provided. Our experience and that in the published literature suggest that LHR is a safe, well-tolerated and effective treatment modality for the indications we report, leading to significant symptom and functional improvement with high patient satisfaction. LHR appears effective in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions such as PSD, PFB and HS, particularly at an early disease stage. We aim to increase awareness of the diversity of laser hair removal indications and add evidence to the medical literature of the wide range of indications for this useful treatment modality. © 2013, Springer-Verlag London.",Hidradenitis suppurativa; Laser hair epilation; Laser hair reduction; Laser hair removal; Pilonidal sinus disease/pseudofolliculitis,adolescent; adult; aged; child; esthetic surgery; female; hair removal; human; laser; low level laser therapy; male; middle aged; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adolescent; Adult; Adult; Aged; Aged; Child; Child; Female; Female; Hair Removal; Hair Removal; Humans; Humans; Laser Therapy; Laser Therapy; Lasers; Lasers; Male; Male; Middle Aged; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; Young Adult,Springer London
"Proximal femoral nails antirotation, Gamma nails, and dynamic hip screws for fixation of intertrochanteric fractures of femur: A meta-analysis","Ma K.-L., Wang X., Luan F.-J., Xu H.-T., Fang Y., Min J., Luan H.-X., Yang F., Zheng H., He S.-J.",2014,Orthopaedics and Traumatology: Surgery and Research,"Background: Which surgical strategy is the best one for intertrochanteric fractures remains a controversial issue. Dynamic hip screw (DHS) and Gamma nail were commonly used but often associated with some complications, such as fixation failure and implant-related fractures. Meanwhile, proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA) fixation has recently been developed for minimally invasive surgery to reduce the complications rate. To facilitate the clinical decision-making, we conducted an updated meta-analysis to discuss the optimal treatment of intertrochanteric fractures aiming to determine which implant gives the lower rates of blood loss, complications (peri-implant fracture, fixation failure, infection, thromboembolic), reoperation, and mortality, as well as the minimal duration related to surgery (fluoroscopic exposure, surgery and hospital stay). Patients and methods: Seven electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (including OVID, Springer, Google Scholar, PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, and Web of Science). Fourteen studies with 1983 patients were included. The modified Jadad Scale was used to assess the methodological quality of these studies. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Comparison among the three groups was based on twelve indicators, including operative time, fluoroscopy time, operative blood loss, length of hospital stays, wound infection or hematoma, pneumonia, thromboembolic complications, fixation failure, operative fracture of femur, later fracture of femur, reoperation, and mortality. Results: (1) PFNA group versus DHS group: PFNA was associated with less blood loss (mean difference (MD) -253.86, 95% CI -270.25 to 237.47; P< 0.00001) and lower rate of fixation failure (MD 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.59; P= 0.004), but led to more fluoroscopy time (MD 2.11, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.43; P< 0.00001). (2) PFNA group versus Gamma nail group: PFNA led to less blood loss (MD -55.30, 95% CI -60.07 to -50.53; P< 0.00001), shorter fluoroscopy time (MD -0.50, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.45; P< 0.00001) and length of hospital stay (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.13; P< 0.00001). (3) DHS group versus Gamma nail group: DHS was associated with lower rate of operative fracture of femur (MD 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.89; P= 0.03), later fracture of femur (MD 0.16, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.43; P= 0.0004), and reoperation (MD 0.49, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.88; P= 0.02), but caused more blood loss (MD 29.49, 95% CI 8.27 to 50.70; P= 0.006). In contrast, there was no difference regarding operative time, infection hematoma, pneumonia, thromboembolic events, and mortality. Discussion: PFNA should be a priority choice for treatment of intertrochanteric fractures with minimal rate of fixation failure, less blood loss and shorter length of hospital stay. DHS has distinct advantages over Gamma nail with lower rate of plant-related complications and should be preferred device for intertrochanteric fractures. However, owing to the low quality evidence currently available, more high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm these findings. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Dynamic hip screw; Gamma nail; Intertrochanteric fractures; Meta-analysis; Proximal femoral nail antirotation,"Article; dynamic hip screw; femur fracture; femur intertrochanteric fracture; fixation failure; fluoroscopy; fracture fixation; gamma nail; hematoma; human; length of stay; meta analysis; mortality; operation duration; operative blood loss; pneumonia; proximal femoral nail antirotation; proximal femur fixation device; randomized controlled trial (topic); reoperation; thromboembolism; wound infection; bone nail; bone screw; devices; Hip Fractures; intramedullary nailing; rotation; treatment outcome; Bone Nails; Bone Screws; Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary; Hip Fractures; Humans; Reoperation; Rotation; Treatment Outcome",Elsevier Masson s.r.l.
Cost effectiveness of percutaneous closure versus medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke in patients with a patent foramen ovale,"Pickett C.A., Villines T.C., Ferguson M.A., Hulten E.A.",2014,American Journal of Cardiology,"In patients with patent foramen ovales (PFOs) and cryptogenic stroke, observational studies have demonstrated reductions in recurrent neurologic events with transcatheter PFO closure compared with medical therapy. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have shown a trend toward benefit with device closure. The cost-effectiveness of PFO closure has not been described. Therefore, a detailed cost analysis was performed using pooled weighted outcome and complication rates from published randomized controlled trials, Medicare cost tables, and wholesale medication prices. Incremental cost per life-year gained and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained by PFO closure was calculated. The commonly accepted cost-effectiveness threshold of <$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained was used. At 2.6 years (the mean duration of randomized controlled trial follow-up), PFO closure was more costly ($16,213, 95% confidence interval [CI] $15,753 to $16,749) per patient, with a cost of $103,607 (95% CI $5,826 to $2,544,750) per life-year gained. The expenditure to prevent 1 combined end point (transient ischemic attack, stroke, and death) at 2.6 years was $1.09 million (95% CI $1.04 million to $1.20 million). Modeling the costs of medical treatment prospectively, PFO closure reached cost-effectiveness (<$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained) at 2.6 years (95% CI 1.5 to 44.2). At 30.2 years (95% CI 28.2 to 36.2), the per patient mean cost of medical therapy exceeded that of PFO closure. In conclusion, PFO closure is associated with higher expenditures related to procedural costs; however, this increase may be offset over time by reduced event rates and costs of long-term medical treatment in patients who undergo transcatheter PFO closure. In younger patients typical of cryptogenic stroke, PFO closure may be cost effective in the long term. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Safety of fast-track rehabilitation after gastrointestinal surgery: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Wang L.-H., Fang F., Lu C.-M., Wang D.-R., Li P., Fu P.",2014,World Journal of Gastroenterology,"METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, WHO International Trial Register, Embase and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to 2014 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing FT and CC or comparing LFT and OFT, with 10 or more randomized participants and about 30 d follow-up. Two reviewers independently extracted data on complications, anastomotic leak, obstruction, wound infection, re-admission between FT and CC or LFT and OFT after gastrointestinal surgery.RESULTS: Twenty-four RCTs of FT vs CC or LFT vs OFT were included. Compared with CC, FT reduced overall complications and wound infection. However, anastomotic leak, obstruction and re-admission were not significantly reduced. The pooled risk ratio (RR) of 0.69 (95%CI: 0.60-0.78; P < 0.001), pooled RR of 0.71 (95%CI: 0.57-0.88; P < 0.001), pooled RR of 0.93 (95%CI: 0.68-1.25; P > 0.05), a pooled RR of 0.87 (95%CI: 0.67-1.15; P > 0.05) and pooled RR of 0.94 (95%CI: 0.73-1.22; P > 0.05) respectively. Compared with OFT, LFT reduced complications, with a pooled RR of 0.66 (95%CI: 0.54-0.81; P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: FTs are safe after gastrointestinal surgery. Additional large, prospective RCTs should be conducted to establish further the safety of this approach.AIM: to compare the safety of fast-track rehabilitation protocols (FT) and conventional care strategies (CC), or FT and laparoscopic surgery (LFT) and FT and open surgery (OFT) after gastrointestinal surgery. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Meta-analysis of relationships between enteric methane yield and milk fatty acid profile in dairy cattle,"van Lingen H.J., Crompton L.A., Hendriks W.H., Reynolds C.K., Dijkstra J.",2014,Journal of Dairy Science,"Various studies have indicated a relationship between enteric methane (CH4) production and milk fatty acid (FA) profiles of dairy cattle. However, the number of studies investigating such a relationship is limited and the direct relationships reported are mainly obtained by variation in CH4 production and milk FA concentration induced by dietary lipid supplements. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to quantify relationships between CH4 yield (per unit of feed and unit of milk) and milk FA profile in dairy cattle and to develop equations to predict CH4 yield based on milk FA profile of cows fed a wide variety of diets. Data from 8 experiments encompassing 30 different dietary treatments and 146 observations were included. Yield of CH4 measured in these experiments was 21.5±2.46g/kg of dry matter intake (DMI) and 13.9±2.30g/kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM). Correlation coefficients were chosen as effect size of the relationship between CH4 yield and individual milk FA concentration (g/100g of FA). Average true correlation coefficients were estimated by a random-effects model. Milk FA concentrations of C6:0, C8:0, C10:0, C16:0, and C16:0-iso were significantly or tended to be positively related to CH4 yield per unit of feed. Concentrations of trans-6+7+8+9 C18:1, trans-10+11 C18:1, cis-11 C18:1, cis-12 C18:1, cis-13 C18:1, trans-16+cis-14 C18:1, and cis-9,12 C18:2 in milk fat were significantly or tended to be negatively related to CH4 yield per unit of feed. Milk FA concentrations of C10:0, C12:0, C14:0-iso, C14:0, cis-9 C14:1, C15:0, and C16:0 were significantly or tended to be positively related to CH4 yield per unit of milk. Concentrations of C4:0, C18:0, trans-10+11 C18:1, cis-9 C18:1, cis-11 C18:1, and cis-9,12 C18:2 in milk fat were significantly or tended to be negatively related to CH4 yield per unit of milk. Mixed model multiple regression and a stepwise selection procedure of milk FA based on the Bayesian information criterion to predict CH4 yield with milk FA as input (g/100g of FA) resulted in the following prediction equations: CH4 (g/kg of DMI)=23.39 + 9.74 × C16:0-iso - 1.06 × trans-10+11 C18:1 - 1.75 × cis-9,12 C18:2 (R2=0.54), and CH4 (g/kg of FPCM)=21.13 - 1.38 × C4:0 + 8.53 × C16:0-iso - 0.22 × cis-9 C18:1 - 0.59 × trans-10+11 C18:1 (R2=0.47). This indicated that milk FA profile has a moderate potential for predicting CH4 yield per unit of feed and a slightly lower potential for predicting CH4 yield per unit of milk. © 2014 American Dairy Science Association.",Dairy cattle; Meta-analysis; Methane; Milk fatty acid profile,"Bos; fatty acid; methane; analysis; animal; animal food; biological model; bovine; chemistry; diet; diet supplementation; female; lactation; meta analysis; metabolism; milk; veterinary; Animal Feed; Animals; Cattle; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Fatty Acids; Female; Lactation; Methane; Milk; Models, Biological",Elsevier Inc.
Systematic review of proximal femoral arthroplasty for non-neoplastic conditions,"Korim M.T., Esler C.N.A., Ashford R.U.",2014,Journal of Arthroplasty,"Proximal femoral arthroplasty (PFA) is an established treatment modality following oncological resection. Increasingly, these prostheses are being used for non-neoplastic conditions such as fractures and bone loss associated with septic or aseptic loosening. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the failure rates, mortality rates and hip outcome scores when PFAs were used in non-neoplastic conditions. There were 14 studies with an average follow-up of 3.8. years (range 0-14. years) describing 356 PFAs. Re-operation for any reason occurred in 23.8% (85/356) of cases. The most common complications were dislocation (15.7%) and infection (7.6%). The mortality rate ranged from 0% to 40%. PFA provides an acceptable surgical solution when confronted with massive bone loss, but it has a high re-operation rate for dislocation and infection. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Bone loss; Hip revision; Megaprosthesis; Proximal femoral arthroplasty,"Article; dislocation; human; infection; mortality; osteolysis; periprosthetic fracture; prosthesis loosening; proximal femoral arthroplasty; surgery; systematic review; total hip prosthesis; treatment outcome; adverse effects; Bone Diseases; femur; follow up; hip arthroplasty; Periprosthetic Fractures; prosthesis failure; Prosthesis-Related Infections; reoperation; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Bone Diseases; Femur; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Periprosthetic Fractures; Prosthesis Failure; Prosthesis-Related Infections; Reoperation",Churchill Livingstone Inc.
Progress in the use of ionic liquids as electrolyte membranes in fuel cells,"Díaz M., Ortiz A., Ortiz I.",2014,Journal of Membrane Science,"This work provides a critical review of the progress in the use of Room Temperature Ionic Liquids (RTILs) as Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolytes in Fuel Cells (FCs). It is well-known that for an efficient early commercialisation of this technology it is necessary to develop a proton exchange membrane with high proton conductivity without water dependency capable of working at temperatures above 100. °C. The use of ionic liquids as electrolytes in electrochemical devices is an emerging field due to their high conductivity, as well as their thermal, chemical and electrochemical stability under anhydrous conditions.

Neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioural effects of polybrominated and perfluorinated chemicals: A systematic review of the epidemiological literature using a quality assessment scheme,"Roth N., Wilks M.F.",2014,Toxicology Letters,"Concerns over effects of halogenated persistent environmental contaminants on the developing brain have been expressed for many years, and human biomonitoring has confirmed that low-level, prenatal and/or postnatal exposure of children to these chemicals is ubiquitous. Over the last decade there have been increasing reports in the epidemiological literature of the potential association of exposure to polybromo diphenylethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) with neurodevelopmental and/or neurobehavioural effects in infants and children, such as adverse birth outcomes, cognitive deficits, developmental delay and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). However, direct evidence from epidemiology studies has been limited and contradictory. Given the general lack of comparability across studies in terms of design, conduct, methodology and reporting, we developed a checklist-type quality assessment scheme based on the STROBE guidelines and the proposed HONEES criteria, and conducted a systematic review of the epidemiological peer-reviewed literature published since 2006 on neurodevelopmental and/or neurobehavioural effects following prenatal and postnatal exposure to PBDEs and PFCs. We rated 7 of the 18 studies that met our inclusion criteria as being of high quality, 7 of moderate quality and 4 of low quality. Frequently observed shortcomings were the lack of consideration of confounding factors; uncertainties regarding exposure characterization; inadequate sample size; the lack of a clear dose-response; and the representativeness/generalizability of the results. Collectively, the epidemiological evidence does currently not support a strong causal association between PBDEs and PFCs and adverse neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioural outcomes in infants and children. However, despite their limitations, the studies raise questions that require further investigation through hypothesis-driven studies using more harmonized study designs and methodologies, more detailed exposure assessments and repeated testing with larger study populations. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Neurodevelopment; Perfluorinated chemicals; Polybromo diphenylethers; Postnatal exposure; Prenatal exposure; Quality assessment,perfluoro compound; polybrominated diphenyl ether; diphenyl ether derivative; fluorocarbon; adverse outcome; Article; attention deficit disorder; developmental disorder; human; neurotoxicity; pregnancy outcome; prenatal exposure; quality control; systematic review; brain; child; child behavior; child development; cognition; drug effects; female; fetus; motor activity; pregnancy; toxicity; Brain; Child; Child Behavior; Child Development; Cognition; Female; Fetus; Fluorocarbons; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Motor Activity; Pregnancy,Elsevier Ireland Ltd

Moreover, the success cases of FTS usage in the software industry are still small. The lack of studies to close the gap between theory and practice is observed as the main barrier to the FTS evolution. In this study, we present a framework to support research on FTS software development. The proposed framework aims to support empirical studies and meta-analysis on FTS. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we propose an initial framework for researching FTS software development, including independent, dependent and context variables. Additionally, we discuss research challenges, and directions for future research.

Vesicoureteral Reflux: Current Management in Children,"Lopez P.-J., Celis S., Reed F., Zubieta R.",2014,Current Urology Reports,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a disorder that has been studied since the early days of pediatric urology. From 1893, when it was first documented in humans by Pozzi, the research and clinical management of VUR has been marked by pendulum swings through the decades. Initially, the vesicoureteral junction was the main subject of study, whereas current practice takes into account the bladder and bowel dynamics. The primary objective, however, is unchanged: preservation of the kidney and its function. Management of the condition has included open surgery, minimally invasive surgery, endoscopic treatment, antibiotic prophylaxis, and watchful waiting.

We conducted a case study systematic review to support proof of concept of the method.Methods: We applied the first 3 steps of the Navigation Guide methodology to human epidemiological data: 1) specify the study question, 2) select the evidence, and 3) rate the quality and strength of the evidence. We developed a protocol, conducted a comprehensive search of the literature, and identified relevant studies using prespecified criteria. We evaluated each study for risk of bias and conducted meta-analyses on a subset of studies. We rated quality and strength of the entire body of human evidence.Objective: We applied the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology to determine whether developmental exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) affects fetal growth in humans.Results: We identified 18 human studies that met our inclusion criteria, and 9 of these were combined through meta-analysis. Through meta-analysis, we estimated that a 1‑ng/mL increase in serum or plasma PFOA was associated with a –18.9 g (95% CI: –29.8, –7.9) difference in birth weight. We concluded that the risk of bias across studies was low, and we assigned a “moderate” quality rating to the overall body of human evidence.Conclusion: On the basis of this first application of the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology, we concluded that there is “sufficient” human evidence that developmental exposure to PFOA reduces fetal growth. © 2014, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

From the meta-analysis of eight mouse gavage data sets, we estimated that exposure of pregnant mice to increasing concentrations of PFOA was associated with a change in mean pup birth weight of –0.023 g (95% CI: –0.029, –0.016) per 1-unit increase in dose (milligrams per kilogram body weight per day). The evidence, consisting of 15 mammalian and 6 nonmammalianstudies, was rated as “moderate” and “low” quality, respectively.Background: In contrast to current methods of expert-based narrative review, the Navigation Guide is a systematic and transparent method for synthesizing environmental health research from multiple evidence streams. The Navigation Guide was developed to effectively and efficiently translate the available scientific evidence into timely prevention-oriented action.Objectives: We applied the Navigation Guide systematic review method to answer the question “Does fetal developmental exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or its salts affect fetal growth in animals ?” and to rate the strength of the experimental animal evidence.Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature, applied prespecified criteria to the search results to identify relevant studies, extracted data from studies, obtained additional informationfrom study authors, conducted meta-analyses, and rated the overall quality and strength of the evidence.Conclusion: Based on this first application of the Navigation Guide methodology, we found sufficient evidence that fetal developmental exposure to PFOA reduces fetal growth in animals. © 2014, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The navigation guide—evidence-based medicine meets environmental health: Integration of animal and human evidence for PFOA effects on fetal growth,"Lam J., Koustas E., Sutton P., Johnson P.I., Atchley D.S., Sen S., Robinson K.A., Axelrad D.A., Woodruff T.J.",2014,Environmental Health Perspectives,"Background The Navigation Guide is a novel systematic review method to synthesize scientific evidence and reach strength of evidence conclusions for environmental health decision making.Objective: Our aim was to integrate scientific findings from human and nonhuman studies to determine the overall strength of evidence for the question “Does developmental exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) affect fetal growth in humans?”.Methods: We developed and applied prespecified criteria to systematically and transparently a) rate the quality of the scientific evidence as “high,” “moderate,” or “low”; b) rate the strength of the human and nonhuman evidence separately as “sufficient,” “limited,” “moderate,” or “evidence of lack of toxicity”; and c) integrate the strength of the human and nonhuman evidence ratings into a strength of the evidence conclusion.Results: We identified 18 epidemiology studies and 21 animal toxicology studies relevant to our study question. We rated both the human and nonhuman mammalian evidence as “moderate” quality and “sufficient” strength. Integration of these evidence ratings produced a final strength of evidence rating in which review authors concluded that PFOA is “known to be toxic” to human reproduction and development based on sufficient evidence of decreased fetal growth in both human and nonhuman mammalian species.Conclusion: We concluded that developmental exposure to PFOA adversely affects human health based on sufficient evidence of decreased fetal growth in both human and nonhuman mammalian species. The results of this case study demonstrate the application of a systematic and transparent methodology, via the Navigation Guide, for reaching strength of evidence conclusions in environmental health. © 2014, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Differentiating crack cocaine from regular cocaine in whole blood samples in drugs and driving cases,"Hackett J., Elian A.A.",2014,Analytical Methods,"In this study, the procedure for analyzing cocainic drugs and metabolites (anhydroecgnonine, anhydroecgnonine methyl ester, benzoylecgonine, cocaine, cocaethylene, ecgnonine ethyl ester, and ecgnonine methyl ester) in whole blood samples obtained from drugs and driving cases using a mixed mode solid phase extraction (SPE) C8/SCX cartridge (Clean Screen DAU206), is described. This extraction and analysis procedure allows forensic analysts to differentiate between drivers who have used ""crack cocaine"" against those using regular cocaine. Samples of whole blood (containing deuterated internal standards) were diluted with an aqueous phosphate buffer (pH 6). Each sample was applied to a conditioned SPE column. The filtrate was collected and adjusted to pH 2. The sorbent was rinsed with deionized (DI) water, aqueous hydrochloric acid and methanol. After drying, cocaine, cocathylene, benzoylecgnonine, and anhydroecgnonine methyl ester were eluted from the SPE column with 3 mL of an elution solvent consisting of methylene chloride-isopropanol-ammonium hydroxide. The original filtrate was applied to a second conditioned SPE column and washed with DI water, aqueous hydrochloric acid and methanol. After drying the SPE sorbent, anhydroecgnonine was eluted with methanol containing 4% ammonium hydroxide (3 mL). The eluates were combined and evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in the mobile phase for analysis by LC-MS/MS in positive multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM). Chromatography was performed in gradient mode employing a C18 column and a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.1% aqueous formic acid. The total run time for each analysis was within five minutes. The limits of quantitation/detection for this method were determined to be 0.5 ng mL-1 and 1.0 ng mL-1 respectively. The method was found to be linear from 1.0 ng mL-1 to 100.0 ng mL-1 (r2 &gt; 0.995). The recoveries of the noted cocaine type drugs were found to be greater than 90%. This method was applied to twenty positive cocaine completed drugs and driving cases, it was found that anhydroecgnonine concentrations ranged from 0 ng mL-1 to 23 ng mL-1, anhydroecgonine methyl ester concentrations ranged from 0 ng mL-1 to 66 ng mL-1, while cocaine was found to range from 25 ng mL-1 to 250 ng mL-1, cocaethylene ranged from 0 ng mL-1 to 80 ng mL-1, benzoylecgnonine concentrations were found to be in the range 90 ng mL-1 to 790 ng mL-1, ecgonine methyl ester concentrations ranged from 40 ng mL-1 to 500 ng mL-1 and ecgonine ethyl ester concentrations were found to be in the range 0 ng mL-1 to 180 ng mL-1. © the Partner Organisations 2014.",,Ammonium hydroxide; Blood; Column chromatography; Cracks; Deionized water; Dichloromethane; Esters; Filtration; Hydrochloric acid; Methanol; Drugs and driving; Elution solvent; Forensic analyst; Internal standards; Limits of quantitations; Mixed-mode solid-phase extraction; Multiple-reaction monitoring modes; Phosphate buffers; Esterification,Royal Society of Chemistry
Intramedullary nails for extracapsular hip fractures in adults,"Queally J.M., Harris E., Handoll H.H.G., Parker M.J.",2014,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,"Background: Intramedullary nails may be used for the surgical fixation of extracapsular hip fractures in adults. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005 and last updated in 2008. Objectives: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different designs of intramedullary nails for treating extracapsular hip fractures in adults. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (6 January 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 12, 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to November Week 3, 2013), MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (3 January 2014), EMBASE (1988 to 2014, Week 1) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (accessed January 2014). Selection criteria: All randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing different types, or design modifications, of intramedullary nails in the treatment of extracapsular hip fractures in adults. Data collection and analysis: At least two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We performed limited meta-analysis using the fixed-effect model. Main results: We included eight new trials, testing seven new comparisons in this update. Overall, we included 17 trials, testing 12 comparisons of different cephalocondylic nail designs. The trials involved a total of 2130 adults (predominantly female and older people) with mainly unstable trochanteric fractures. All trials were at unclear risk of bias for most domains, with the majority at high risk of detection bias for subjective outcomes. The three quasi-randomised trials were at high risk for selection bias. Four trials (910 participants) compared the proximal femoral nail (PFN) with the Gamma nail. There was no significant difference between the two implants in functional outcome (the very low quality evidence being limited to results from single trials), mortality (low quality evidence: 86/415 versus 80/415; risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.41), serious fixation complications (operative fracture of the femur, cut-out, non-union and later fracture of the femur) nor re-operations (low quality evidence: 45/455 versus 36/455; RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.90). Two trials (185 participants) provided very low quality evidence of a lack of clinically significant difference in outcome (functional score, mortality, fracture fixation complications and re-operation) between the ACE trochanteric nail and the Gamma nail. Two trials (200 participants) provided very low quality evidence of a lack of significant difference in outcome (mobility score, pain, fracture fixation complications or re-operations) between the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) nail and the Gamma 3 nail. Seven of the nine trials evaluating different comparisons provided very low quality evidence of a lack of significant between-group differences in all of the reported main outcomes for the following comparisons: ACE trochanteric nail versus Gamma 3 nail (112 participants); gliding nail versus Gamma nail (80 participants); Russell-Taylor Recon nail versus long Gamma nail (34 participants, all under 50 years); proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) nail versus Targon PF nail (80 participants); dynamically versus statically locked intramedullary hip screw (IMHS) nail (81 participants); sliding versus non-sliding Gamma 3 nail (80 participants, all under 60 years); and long versus standard PFNA nails (40 participants with reverse oblique fractures). The other two single comparison trials also provided very low quality evidence of a lack of significant between-group differences in all of the main outcomes with single exceptions. The trial (215 participants) comparing the ENDOVIS nail versus the IMHS nail found low quality evidence of poorer mobility in the ENDOVIS nail group, where more participants in this group were bedridden after their operation (29/105 versus 18/110; RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.85; P = 0.05). The trial (113 participants) comparing the InterTan nail versus the PFNA II nail found very low quality evidence that more PFNA II group participants experienced thigh pain (3/47 versus 12/46; RR: 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.81). Authors' conclusions: The limited evidence from the randomised trials undertaken to date is insufficient to determine whether there are important differences in outcome between different designs of intramedullary nails used in treating extracapsular hip fractures. Given the evidence of superiority of the sliding hip screw compared with intramedullary nails for extracapsular hip fractures, further studies comparing different designs of intramedullary nails are not a priority. Any new design should be evaluated in a randomised comparison with the sliding hip screw. © 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"bleeding; clinical effectiveness; fracture fixation; fracture healing; Harris hip score; hip fracture; human; immobility; length of stay; mortality; operation duration; outcome assessment; peroperative complication; postoperative complication; priority journal; range of motion; reoperation; Review; systematic review; adverse effects; aged; bone nail; devices; female; Hip Fractures; intramedullary nailing; male; meta analysis; middle aged; procedures; prosthesis; randomized controlled trial (topic); very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bone Nails; Female; Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary; Hip Fractures; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Prosthesis Design; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",John Wiley and Sons Ltd
Fast-track surgery versus traditional perioperative care in laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery: A meta-analysis,"Zhao J.-H., Sun J.-X., Gao P., Chen X.-W., Song Y.-X., Huang X.-Z., Xu H.-M., Wang Z.-N.",2014,BMC Cancer,"Background: Both laparoscopic and fast-track surgery (FTS) have shown some advantages in colorectal surgery. However, the effectiveness of using both methods together is unclear. We performed this meta-analysis to compare the effects of FTS with those of traditional perioperative care in laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery.Methods: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Ovid databases for eligible studies until April 2014. The main end points were the duration of the postoperative hospital stay, time to first flatus after surgery, time of first bowel movement, total postoperative complication rate, readmission rate, and mortality.Results: Five randomized controlled trials and 5 clinical controlled trials with 1,317 patients were eligible for analysis. The duration of the postoperative hospital stay (weighted mean difference [WMD], -1.64 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.25 to -1.03; p < 0.001), time to first flatus (WMD, -0.40 day; 95% CI, -0.77 to -0.04; p = 0.03), time of first bowel movement (WMD, -0.98 day; 95% CI, -1.45 to -0.52; p < 0.001), and total postoperative complication rate (risk ratio [RR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.56-0.80; p < 0.001) were significantly reduced in the FTS group. No significant differences were noted in the readmission rate (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41-1.01; p = 0.06) or mortality (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 0.42-5.71; p = 0.51).Conclusion: Among patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery, FTS is associated with a significantly shorter postoperative hospital stay, more rapid postoperative recovery, and, notably, greater safety than is expected from traditional care. © 2014 Zhao et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Colorectal cancer; Fast track surgery; Laparoscopic surgery,"adult; adverse effects; aged; bibliographic database; clinical trial (topic); Colorectal Neoplasms; colorectal surgery; comparative study; convalescence; human; laparoscopy; length of stay; male; meta analysis; middle aged; mortality; pathology; perioperative period; procedures; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Clinical Trials as Topic; Colorectal Neoplasms; Colorectal Surgery; Databases, Bibliographic; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Perioperative Care; Recovery of Function",BioMed Central Ltd.
Pattern-based detection of toxic metals in surface water with DNA polyfluorophores,"Yuen L.H., Franzini R.M., Wang S., Crisalli P., Singh V., Jiang W., Kool E.T.",2014,Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,"Heavy metal contamination of water can be toxic to humans and wildlife; thus the development of methods to detect this contamination is of high importance. Here we describe the design and application of DNA-based fluorescent chemosensors on microbeads to differentiate eight toxic metal ions in water. We developed and synthesized four fluorescent 2′-deoxyribosides of metal-binding ligands. A tetramer-length oligodeoxy-fluoroside (ODF) library of 6561 members was constructed and screened for sequences responsive to metal ions, of which seven sequences were selected. Statistical analysis of the response patterns showed successful differentiation of the analytes at concentrations as low as 100 nM. Sensors were able to classify water samples from 13 varied sites and quantify metal contamination in unknown specimens. The results demonstrate the practical potential of bead-based ODF chemosensors to analyze heavy metal contamination in water samples by a simple and inexpensive optical method. Detecting metal contamination in surface/ground water is crucial for protecting human health. The design and synthesis of metal-binding fluorescent nucleosides and development of a sensor array with DNA-polyfluorophores on beads is described, as well as their ability to detect and differentiate environmental contaminants in water. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Catalysis engineering of bifunctional solids for the one-step synthesis of liquid fuels from syngas: A review,"Sartipi S., Makkee M., Kapteijn F., Gascon J.",2014,Catalysis Science and Technology,"The combination of acidic zeolites and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalysts for one-step production of liquid fuels from syngas is critically reviewed. Bifunctional systems are classified by the proximity between FTS and acid functionalities on three levels: reactor, catalyst particle, and active phase. A thorough analysis of the published literature on this topic reveals that efficiency in the production of liquid fuels correlates well with the proximity of FTS and acid sites. Moreover, possible side reactions over the FTS metal, including direct CO hydrogenation and hydrocarbon hydrogenolysis, are addressed. The contribution of these side reactions should carefully be considered and separated from that of the zeolite function when evaluating the performance and product spectrum of zeolite-containing catalysts.

Proximal femoral nail antirotation versus dynamic hip screw for intertrochanteric fracture in elders: a meta-analysis,"Yuan X., Yao Q., Ni J., Peng L., Yu D.",2014,National Medical Journal of China,"Objective: To assess the efficacies of proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) versus dynamic hip screw (DHS) for intertrochanteric fracture in elders. Methods: The databases of PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CBM, CNKI and WANFANG were searched for the relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to May 18, 2013. After quality evaluation and data extraction by two authors independently, meta-analyses were performed with the RevMan5. 1 software. And the levels of evidence were evaluated by the GRADEprofile 3.6 software. Results: A total of 17 studies (n = 1344) were included and there were 656 patients in PFNA group and 688 in DHS respectively. Meta-analyses showed that, as compared with DHS, PFNA could significantly decrease fixation failure rate (odds ratio (OR) =0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.12, 0.57], P = 0.0008), reduce average fracture healing time (weighted mean difference (WMD) = - 15.11, 95% CI = [- 24.36, - 5.85], P = 0.001), improve excellent and good rate for Harris score (OR = 0.29, 95% CI = [0.15, 0.56], P = 0.0002), yield a higher Harris score (WMD = 6.88, 95% CI = [0.96, 12.80], P = 0.02) and reduce the rate of coxa vara (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = [0.18, 0.92], P = 0.03). However, there was no statistical significance in 1-year mortality, postoperative nonunion and delayed union, postoperative femoral head necrosis, postoperative femoral fractures or femoral head necrosis. The importance of outcomes was ""critical"". And the level of evidences based on the GRADE approach was from ""very low"" to ""low"". Conclusion: PFNA is superior to DHS. Due to the limitations of the included studies, more large-sample and high-quality RCTs are required. And subgroup analysis based on fracture types should be performed.

Tamponade in surgery for retinal detachment associated with proliferative vitreoretinopathy,"Schwartz S.G., Flynn H.W., Jr., Lee W.-H., Wang X.",2014,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,"Background: Retinal detachment (RD) with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) often requires surgery to restore normal anatomy and to stabilize or improve vision. PVR usually occurs in association with recurrent RD (that is, after initial retinal re-attachment surgery) but occasionally may be associated with primary RD. Either way, a tamponade agent (gas or silicone oil) is needed during surgery to reduce the rate of postoperative recurrent RD. Objectives: The objective of this review was to assess the relative safety and effectiveness of various tamponade agents used with surgery for retinal detachment (RD) complicated by proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to June 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2013), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to June 2013), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 26 June 2013. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of participants undergoing surgery for RD associated with PVR that compared various tamponade agents. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors screened the search results independently. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results: The review included 516 participants from three RCTs. One study was conducted in the USA and consisted of two trials: the first trial randomized 151 adults to receive either silicone oil or sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas tamponades; and the second trial randomized 271 adults to receive either silicone oil or perfluropropane (C3F8) gas tamponades. The third trial was a multi-center international trial and randomized 94 participants (age range not specified) to receive heavy silicone oil (a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8) and silicone oil) versus standard silicone oil (either 1000 centistokes or 5000 centistokes, per the surgeon's preference). In participants with RD associated with PVR, outcomes after pars plana vitrectomy and infusion of either silicone oil, perfluropropane gas, or sulfur hexafluoride gas appeared comparable for a broad variety of cases. There were no significant differences between silicone oil and perfluoropropane gas in terms of the proportion of participants achieving at least 5/200 visual acuity (risk ratio (RR) 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.31) or achieving macular attachment (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15) at a minimum of one year. Although sulfur hexafluoride gas was reported to be associated with significantly worse anatomic and visual outcomes than was silicone oil at one year (quantitative data not reported), there were no significant differences between silicone oil and sulfur hexafluoride gas in terms of achieving at least 5/200 visual acuity at two years (RR 1.57; 95% CI 0.93 to 2.66). For macular attachment, participants treated with silicone oil received significantly more favourable outcomes than did participants who received sulfur hexafluoride at both one year (quantitative data not reported) and two years (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.86). The first two trials did not perform any sample size calculation or power detection. In the third trial, which had a power of 80% to detect differences, heavy silicone oil was not shown to be superior to standard silicone oil. There were no significant differences between standard silicone oil and heavy silicone oil in the change in visual acuity at one year using adjusted mean logMAR visual acuity (mean difference -0.03 logMAR; 95% CI -0.35 to 0.29). Adverse events were not reported for the first two trials. For the third trial, only the total number of adverse events was reported, and adverse events for each group were not specified. Of the 94 participants, four died, 26 had recurrent retinal detachment, 22 developed glaucoma, four developed a cataract, and two had capsular fibrosis. All three trials employed adequate methods for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. None of the trials employed masking of participants and surgeons, and only the third trial masked outcome assessors. The first trial had a large portion of participants excluded from the final analyses, while the other two trials were at low risk of attrition bias. All trials appear to be free of reporting bias. The first two trials were funded by the National Eye Institute, and the third trial was funded by the German Research Foundation. Authors' conclusions: The use of either perfluropropane or standard silicone oil appears reasonable for most patients with RD associated with PVR. Because there do not appear to be any major differences in outcomes between the two agents, the choice of a tamponade agent should be individualized for each patient. Heavy silicone oil, which is not available for routine clinical use in the USA, has not demonstrated evidence of superiority over standard silicone oil. © 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"dimeticone; ethane; hexafluroethane; perfluorohexyloctane; perfluorooctane; perfluropropane; propane; silicone oil; sulfur hexafluoride; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; perflutren; silicone oil; sulfur hexafluoride; clinical effectiveness; drug safety; epidemiological data; human; intraocular pressure; outcome assessment; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); retina detachment; Review; systematic review; visual acuity; vitreoretinopathy; adult; meta analysis; recurrent disease; retina detachment; review; vitreoretinopathy; Adult; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recurrence; Retinal Detachment; Silicone Oils; Sulfur Hexafluoride; Vitreoretinopathy, Proliferative",John Wiley and Sons Ltd
Pollution distribution of heavy metals in surface soil at an informal electronic-waste recycling site,"Fujimori T., Takigami H.",2014,Environmental Geochemistry and Health,"We studied distribution of heavy metals [lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn)] in surface soil at an electronic-waste (e-waste) recycling workshop near Metro Manila in the Philippines to evaluate the pollution size (spot size, small area or the entire workshop), as well as to assess heavy metal transport into the surrounding soil environment. On-site length-of-stride-scale (~70 cm) measurements were performed at each surface soil point using field-portable X-ray fluorescence (FP-XRF). The surface soil at the e-waste recycling workshop was polluted with Cu, Zn and Pb, which were distributed discretely in surface soil. The site was divided into five areas based on the distance from an entrance gate (y-axis) of the e-waste recycling workshop. The three heavy metals showed similar concentration gradients in the y-axis direction. Zn, Pb and Cu concentrations were estimated to decrease to half of their maximum concentrations at ~3, 7 and 7 m from the pollution spot, respectively, inside the informal e-waste recycling workshop. Distance from an entrance may play an important role in heavy metal transport at the soil surface. Using on-site FP-XRF, we evaluated the metal ratio to characterise pollution features of the solid surface. Variability analysis of heavy metals revealed vanishing surficial autocorrelation over metre ranges. Also, the possibility of concentration prediction at unmeasured points using geostatistical kriging was evaluated, and heavy metals had a relative ""small"" pollution scales and remained inside the original workshop compared with toxic organohalogen compounds. Thus, exposure to heavy metals may directly influence the health of e-waste workers at the original site rather than the surrounding habitat and environmental media. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",E-waste recycling; Heavy metal; Pollution distribution; Portable XRF; Surface soil,"concentration (composition); copper; heavy metal; lead; organohalogen; pollutant transport; recycling; soil pollution; X-ray fluorescence; zinc; National Capital Region; Philippines; copper; heavy metal; lead; zinc; article; electronic waste; environmental monitoring; equipment; methodology; Philippines; recycling; soil pollutant; spatial analysis; spectrometry; Copper; Electronic Waste; Environmental Monitoring; Lead; Metals, Heavy; Philippines; Recycling; Soil Pollutants; Spatial Analysis; Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission; Zinc",
"In vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of a novel 4,6-bis ((E)-4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyryl)-1-phenethylpyrimidine-2(1 H)-thione","Lee J.H., Lee K.-R., Su Z.-Y., Boyanapalli S.S.-S., Barman D.N., Huang M.-T., Chen L., Magesh S., Hu L., Kong A.-N.T.",2014,Chemical Research in Toxicology,"Inflammation plays a critical defensive role in the human body. However, uncontrolled or aberrant inflammatory responses contribute to various acute and chronic diseases. The Nrf2-ARE pathway plays a pivotal role in the regulation of inflammatory markers, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). On the basis of this concept, we synthesized a novel anti-inflammatory 4,6-bis ((E)-4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyryl)-1-phenethylpyrimidine- 2(1H)-thione (HPT), and in vitro experiments using HepG2-C8 ARE-luciferase- transfected cells demonstrated the induction of Nrf2-ARE activity. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells, HPT treatment reduced the production of nitric oxide (NO) as well as the protein and mRNA expression levels of COX-2 and iNOS, in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, HPT suppressed the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. In LPS-induced macrophages, HPT inhibited COX-2 and iNOS by blocking the activation of p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). Furthermore, an in vivo anti-inflammatory study was performed using a TPA-induced skin inflammation mouse model, and the results showed that HPT reduced TPA-induced inflammation and attenuated the expression of COX-2 and iNOS in TPA-induced mouse skin tissue. Thus, HPT demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity both in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells and TPA-stimulated mouse skin and may therefore serve as a potential anti-inflammatory agent. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"4,6 bis (4 hydroxy 3 methoxystyryl) 1 phenethylpyrimidine 2(1h)thione; antiinflammatory agent; cyclooxygenase 2; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; lipopolysaccharide; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; nitric oxide; pyrimidine derivative; transcription factor Nrf2; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-1,3-acetate; 4,6-bis ((E)-4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyryl)-1-phenethylpyrimidine-2(1H)-thione; cyclooxygenase 2; inducible nitric oxide synthase; lipopolysaccharide; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; pyrimidine derivative; thioketone; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; article; cell growth; cell proliferation; cell viability; cytotoxicity; down regulation; drug synthesis; enzyme activation; female; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; macrophage; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; systematic review; analogs and derivatives; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; chemical structure; chemically induced; chemistry; dose response; HepG2 cell line; inflammation; metabolism; structure activity relation; tumor cell culture; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Cyclooxygenase 2; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Inflammation; Lipopolysaccharides; Mice; Molecular Structure; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II; Pyrimidines; Structure-Activity Relationship; Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate; Thiones; Tumor Cells, Cultured",American Chemical Society
"A review on removing pharmaceutical contaminants from wastewater by constructed wetlands: Design, performance and mechanism","Li Y., Zhu G., Ng W.J., Tan S.K.",2014,Science of the Total Environment,"This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state of research activities on the application of constructed wetlands for removing pharmaceutical contaminants from wastewater. The focus of the review was placed on the application of constructed wetlands as an alternative secondary wastewater treatment system or as a wastewater polishing treatment system. The design parameters of the reported constructed wetlands including the physical configuration, hydraulic mode, vegetation species, and targeting pharmaceuticals were summarized. The removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals under different conditions in the wetlands were evaluated at the macroscopic level. In addition, the importance of the three main components of constructed wetlands (substrate, plants and microbes) for pharmaceutical removal was analyzed to elucidate the possible removal mechanisms involved. There is a general consensus among many researchers that constructed wetlands hold great potential of being used as an alternative secondary wastewater treatment system or as a wastewater polishing treatment system for the removal of pharmaceuticals, but relevant reported studies are scarce and are not conclusive in their findings. Current knowledge is limited on the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals in constructed wetlands, the removal mechanisms involved, the toxicity to constructed wetlands caused by pharmaceuticals, and the influences of certain important parameters (configuration design, hydraulic mode, temperature and seasonality, pH, oxygen and redox potential, etc.). This review promotes further research on these issues to provide more and better convincing evidences for the function and performance of larger laboratory-scale, pilot-scale or full-scale constructed wetlands. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Constructed wetland; Emerging pollutant; Pharmaceutical; Wastewater treatment,"Drug products; Polishing; Reclamation; Redox reactions; Research; Wastewater treatment; Configuration designs; Constructed wetlands; Emerging pollutants; Macroscopic levels; Pharmaceutical contaminants; Removal efficiencies; Vegetation species; Wastewater treatment system; Wetlands; amoxicillin; ampicillin; atenolol; caffeine; carbamazepine; clarithromycin; cotinine; diclofenac; doxycycline; enrofloxacin; erythromycin; fluoxetine; gemfibrozil; ibuprofen; ketoprofen; lincomycin; metoprolol; nadolol; naproxen; oxygen; paracetamol; propranolol; salicylic acid; sotalol; sulfadimethoxine; sulfamethoxazole; sulfapyridine; tetracycline; trimethoprim; constructed wetland; design; drug; laboratory method; parameterization; performance assessment; redox potential; substrate; waste treatment; wastewater; water treatment; effluent; oxidation reduction state; pH; pharmaceutical care; priority journal; review; seasonal variation; temperature; waste water management; water contamination; wetland; Constructed wetland; Emerging pollutant; Pharmaceutical; Wastewater treatment; Facility Design and Construction; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification; Wetlands",Elsevier

Experimental analyses of metal-composite bonded joints: damage identification,"de Medeiros R., Borges E.N., Tita V.",2014,Applied Adhesion Science,"The advent of composite co-cured and co-bonded integrated construction in aircraft structures has lead to the replacement of fastened joints with bonded joints between the skins and the stiffeners. Skin-stiffener debondings could occur due to impact or other operational reasons and it is usually internal failure. Damage identification of bonded components, which are often vital elements in many structures, is crucial for the prevention of failure of the entire structure. Thus, different researchers have investigated vibration-based methods as an alternative technique to be used in the structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. Hence, this work consists of investigating experimentally through the vibration-based method, the dynamic behavior changes in a bonded metal-composite structure by using piezoelectric transducer and accelerometers in order to monitory the damage. The damage is an artificial debonding in the joint, which was simulated by inserting Teflon™ tapes within the joint. In-situ inspection as ensured by accelerometer and piezoelectric transducers (PZT) bonded to the structure. Indeed, with a simple comparison of the frequency response functions is difficult to conclude if there is damage in the structure, unless a large damage is presented. However, by using damage metrics, it is possible to identify the damage with more accuracy. Thus, the experimental results obtained by the accelerometers were compared to the data provided by the smart composite sensors (PZT). Finally, it was discussed the advantages and limitations of the experimental analyses and the identification technique proposal. © 2014, Medeiros et al.; licensee Springer.",Bonded joints; Experimental dynamics analyses; Smart composites; Structural health monitoring,,Springer International Publishing
A practical field extraction method for noninvasive monitoring of hormone activity in the black rhinoceros,"Edwards K.L., McArthur H.M., Liddicoat T., Walker S.L.",2014,Conservation Physiology,"Non-invasive hormone analysis is a vital tool in assessing an animal's adrenal and reproductive status, which can be beneficial to in situ and ex situ conservation. However, it can be difficult to employ these techniques when monitoring in situ populations away from controlled laboratory conditions, when electricity is not readily available. A practical method for processing faecal samples in the field, which enables samples to be extracted soon after defaecation and stored in field conditions for prolonged periods prior to hormone analysis, is therefore warranted. This study describes the development of an optimal field extraction method, which includes hand-shaking faecal material in 90% methanol, before loading this extract in a 40% solvent onto HyperSep™ C8 solid-phase extraction cartridges, stored at ambient temperatures. This method was successfully validated for measurement of adrenal and reproductive hormone metabolites in faeces of male and female black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) and was rigorously tested in controlled laboratory and simulated field conditions. All the hormones tested demonstrated between 83 and 94% and between 42 and 89% recovery of synthetic and endogenous hormone metabolites, respectively, with high precision of replication. Furthermore, results obtained following the developed optimal field extraction method were highly correlated with the control laboratory method. Cartridges can be stored at ambient (cool, dry or warm, humid) conditions for periods of up to 6 months without degradation, before re-extraction of hormone metabolites for analysis by enzyme immunoassay. The described method has great potential to be applied to monitor faecal reproductive and adrenal hormone metabolites in a wide variety of species and allows samples to be stored in the field for up to 6 months prior to analysis. This provides the opportunity to investigate hormone relationships within in situ populations, where equipment and facilities may previously have been limiting. © The Author 2014.",Corticosterone; Faeces; In situ; Progesterone; Solid-phase extraction; testosterone,,Oxford University Press
Association between environmental contaminants and health outcomes in indigenous populations of the Circumpolar North,"Singh K., Bjerregaard P., Chan H.M.",2014,International journal of circumpolar health,"RESULTS: Of 559 citations, 60 studies were relevant. The studies fell under the following categories: paediatric (n=18), reproductive health (n=18), obstetrics and gynaecology (n=9), cardiology (n=7), bone health (n=2), oncology (n=2), endocrinology (n=2) and other (n=2). All studies, except one from Arctic Finland, were either from Nunavik or Greenland. Most studies assessed polychlorinated biphenyls (n=43) and organochlorine pesticides (n=29). Fewer studies examined heavy metals, perfluorinated compounds, or polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Details of study results for each health category are provided.CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to make conclusive statements about the effects of environmental contaminants on health due to mixed results, small number of studies and studies being restricted to a small number of regions. Meta-analytical synthesis of the evidence should be considered for priority contaminants and health outcomes. The following research gaps should be addressed in future studies: association of contaminants and health in other Arctic regions (i.e. Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Nunavut, Nunatsiavut, Alaska, European North and Russian North); assessment of contaminants on chronic diseases; inclusion of clinical endpoints in assessments; and assessment of the emerging contaminants of perfluorinated compounds and polybrominated diphenyl ethers.BACKGROUND: Since the 1990s, research has been carried out to monitor environmental contaminants and their effects on human health in the Arctic. Although evidence shows that Arctic indigenous peoples are exposed to higher levels of contaminants and do worse on several dimensions of health compared with other populations, the contribution of such exposures on adverse outcomes is unclear.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to provide a synopsis of the published epidemiological literature that has examined association between environmental contaminants and health outcomes in Arctic indigenous populations.DESIGN: A literature search was conducted in OVID Medline (1946-January 2014) using search terms that combined concepts of contaminant and indigenous populations in the Arctic.

Emerging trends in groundwater pollution and quality,Kurwadkar S.,2014,Water Environment Research,"Groundwater pollution due to anthropogenic activities may impact overall groundwater quality. Organic and inorganic pollutants have been routinely detected at unsafe levels in groundwater rendering this important drinking water resource practically unusable. Vulnerability of groundwater pollution and subsequent impact has been documented in various studies across the globe. Field studies as well as mathematical models have demonstrated increasing levels of pollutants in both shallow and deep aquifer systems. New emerging pollutants such as organic micro-pollutants have also been detected in some industrialized as well as in developing countries. Increased vulnerability coupled with ever growing demand for groundwater may pose a greater threat of pollution due to induced recharge and lack of environmental safeguards to protect groundwater sources. In this review paper, comprehensive assessment of groundwater quality impact due to human activities such as improper management of organic and inorganic waste, and natural sources is documented. A detailed review of published reports and peer reviewed journal papers across the world clearly demonstrate that groundwater quality is declining over time. A proactive approach is needed to prevent human health and ecological consequences due to ingestion of contaminated groundwater.

Semifluorinated alkanes as a liquid drug carrier system for topical ocular drug delivery,"Dutescu R.M., Panfil C., Merkel O.M., Schrage N.",2014,European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics,"Semifluorinated alkanes (SFA, e.g. perfluorobutylpentane F4H5, perfluorohexyloctane F6H8) are inert, non-toxic fluids capable of dissolving lipophilic drugs. The aim of this study to assess the bioavailability and safety of SFAs as drug solvents for the topical ocular application of Cyclosporin A (CsA). A commercially available CsA formulation (Restasis®, 0.05% CsA in castor oil) was tested against two novel formulations of 0.05% CSA in (a) F4H5 containing Ethanol (0.5 w/w%) and (b) F6H8 containing Ethanol (0.5 w/w%) with 0.05% CsA. Formulations were tested on rabbit corneas cultured on an artificial anterior chamber with a constant flow of an aqueous humour supplement (Ex Vivo Eye Irritation Test (EVEIT) system). Anterior chamber fluids were sampled at multiple time points to analyse the CsA concentration following single and repeated application regimes by HPLC. Photographs of fluorescein sodium-stained corneas were recorded for corneal toxicity evaluation. The impact of the formulations on the integrity of the corneal barrier function was tested after drug application by fluorescein sodium corneal diffusion experiments. The influence on the corneal metabolism was evaluated by analysis of the metabolic markers glucose and lactate. Restasis® did not pass the corneal barrier after short term application, CsA in ethanolic F4H6 reached a maximum of 152.95 ng/ml in anterior chamber fluid samples whilst CsA in ethanolic F6H8 reached a maximum of 15.12 ng/ml. After repeated applications for 8 h, Restasis® reached 21.07 ng/ml compared to 247.62 ng/ml and 174.5 ng/ml for F4H5 and F6H8, respectively. No corneal toxicity was observed in following application of any of the formulations. In contrast to the commercially available castor oil-based formulation, CsA dissolved in SFAs reached therapeutic inner ocular concentrations after topical administration, possibly leading to the replacement of systemic applications of CsA for inflammatory ocular disease. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Cyclosporine; EVEIT; Ex vivo model; Ocular drug delivery; Ocular pharmacokinetics; Semifluorinated alkanes,"alkane; castor oil; cyclosporin; drug carrier; fluorescein; fluorine; glucose; lactic acid; lipid; solvent; animal; chemistry; cornea; drug effects; eye; Eye Diseases; inflammation; kinetics; rabbit; topical drug administration; Administration, Topical; Alkanes; Animals; Castor Oil; Cornea; Cyclosporine; Drug Carriers; Eye; Eye Diseases; Fluorescein; Fluorine; Glucose; Inflammation; Kinetics; Lactic Acid; Lipids; Rabbits; Solvents",Elsevier
Meta-analysis of efficacy and safety of fast-track surgery in gastrectomy for gastric cancer,"Li Y.-J., Huo T.-T., Xing J., An J.-Z., Han Z.-Y., Liu X.-N., Zhao Q.-C.",2014,World Journal of Surgery,"Background: Fast-track surgery (FTS) is a promising program for surgical patients and has been applied to several surgical diseases. FTS is much superior to conventional perioperative care. Our aim was to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of FTS and conventional perioperative care for patients undergoing gastrectomy using a systematic review. Methods: We searched the literature in PubMed, SCOPUS, and EMBASE up to November 2013. No language restriction was applied. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and odds ratios (ORs) with their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were used for analysis by a fixed or a random effects model according to the heterogeneity assumption. Results: In the present meta-analysis, we included five randomized controlled trials and one controlled clinical trial from five studies. Compared with conventional care, FTS shortened the duration of flatus (WMD -21.08; 95 % CI -27.46 to -14.71, z = 6.48, p < 0.00001 in the open surgery group; WMD -8.20; 95 % CI -12.87 to -3.53, z = 3.44, p = 0.0006 in the laparoscopic surgery group), accelerated the decrease in C-reactive protein (WMD -15.56; 95 % CI 21.28 to 9.83, z = 5.33, p < 0.00001), shortened the postoperative stay (WMD -2.00; 95 % CI -2.69 to -1.30, z = 5.64, p < 0.00001), and reduced hospitalization costs (WMD -447.72; 95 % CI -615.92 to -279.51, z = 5.22, p < 0.00001). FTS made no significant difference in operation times (p = 0.93), intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.79), or postoperative complications (p = 0.07). Conclusions: Based on current evidence, the FTS protocol was feasible for gastric cancer patients who underwent gastrectomy (distal subtotal gastrectomy, proximal subtotal gastrectomy, or radical total gastrectomy) via open or laparoscopic surgery.

Samples, containing one gram of each tested cement, were prepared and transferred to a 100 mL Teflon tube with a mixture of 7.0 mL of nitric acid and 21 mL of hydrochloric acid. After the reaction, the mixture was filtered and then volumed to 50 mL of distilled water. For each metal, specific patterns were determined from universal standards. Arsenic quantification was performed by hydride generator. The analysis was performed five times and the data were statistically analyzed at 5% level of significance. Only the cadmium presented concentration levels of values lower than the quantification limit of the device. The AAS analysis showed increased levels of calcium, nickel, and zinc in structural white PC. Type V PC presented the greatest concentration levels of arsenic, chromium, copper, iron, lead, and manganese (P < 0.05). Bismuth was found in all cements, and the lowest concentration levels were observed in Portland cements, while the highest were observed in ProRoot MTA.

Progress and perspectives in converting biogas to transportation fuels,"Yang L., Ge X., Wan C., Yu F., Li Y.",2014,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,"The discovery of abundant natural gas resources has greatly increased the study of using methane as a feedstock to produce transportation fuels. Biogas (primarily containing methane and CO2), which is generated from waste biomass via anaerobic digestion or landfills, is regarded as a renewable source of methane, and has the potential to achieve sustainable production of transportation fuels. Since biogas also contains a significant amount of impurities (e.g., H2S, NH3, and siloxane), a cleaning procedure is generally required prior to conversion to transportation fuels. Physical approaches, mainly compression and liquefaction, have been commercially applied to upgrade biogas to bio-compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied biogas (LBG). For chemical approaches, catalytic reforming is the dominant method for converting methane to syngas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) or fermentation of syngas to a variety of alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, and butanol) and liquid hydrocarbon fuels (e.g., gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels). High purity hydrogen, a clean fuel, can also be produced via reforming. Methanol can be produced by direct oxidation of methane, while interest in the biological conversion of methane to methanol has grown recently due to its mild operating conditions, high conversion efficiency, and potential for using raw biogas. The derived methanol can be further converted to gasoline via a methanol to gasoline (MTG) process. This paper provides a comprehensive review of major research progress on technologies for converting biogas/methane into transportation fuels, and discusses the principles, kinetics, operating conditions, and performance of each technology. Efficient direct conversion of biogas into ethanol and higher alcohol fuels (e.g. butanol), which is envisaged to be the focus of research pursuits in the near future, is also discussed, with emphasis on the development of methane-utilizing microbes through genetic engineering. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Endocrine disruptive compounds and cardio-metabolic risk factors in children,"Khalil N., Chen A., Lee M.",2014,Current Opinion in Pharmacology,"The endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) are exogenous chemicals that can disrupt hormonal signaling system. EDCs are ubiquitous in our environment and many EDC are detectable in humans. With the increasing obesity prevalence in children it is imperative to explore the role of EDC as obesogens. This review summarizes recent epidemiological evidence regarding impact of these EDC on weight gain and metabolic outcomes in children. The EDCs include pharmaceuticals, pesticides, industrial by-products, and cigarette smoke. Current evidence suggests a link between early life exposure to some industrial by-products, synthetic hormones and cigarette smoke with weight gain. However, there is inconclusive evidence of an association between exposure to fungicides, dioxin, phytoestrogens, flame retardants, heavy metals and childhood obesity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The complement system in human cardiometabolic disease,"Hertle E., Stehouwer C.D.A., van Greevenbroek M.M.J.",2014,Molecular Immunology,"The complement system has been implicated in obesity, fatty liver, diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Complement factors are produced in adipose tissue and appear to be involved in adipose tissue metabolism and local inflammation. Thereby complement links adipose tissue inflammation to systemic metabolic derangements, such as low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. Furthermore, complement has been implicated in pathophysiological mechanisms of diet- and alcohol induced liver damage, hyperglycaemia, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis and fibrinolysis.In this review, we summarize current evidence on the role of the complement system in several processes of human cardiometabolic disease. C3 is the central component in complement activation, and has most widely been studied in humans. C3 concentrations are associated with insulin resistance, liver dysfunction, risk of the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and CVD. C3 can be activated by the classical, the lectin and the alternative pathway of complement activation; and downstream activation of C3 activates the terminal pathway. Complement may also be activated via extrinsic proteases of the coagulation, fibrinolysis and the kinin systems. Studies on the different complement activation pathways in human cardiometabolic disease are limited, but available evidence suggests that they may have distinct roles in processes underlying cardiometabolic disease. The lectin pathway appeared beneficial in some studies on type 2 diabetes and CVD, while factors of the classical and the alternative pathway were related to unfavourable cardiometabolic traits. The terminal complement pathway was also implicated in insulin resistance and liver disease, and appears to have a prominent role in acute and advanced CVD.The available human data suggest a complex and potentially causal role for the complement system in human cardiometabolic disease. Further, preferably longitudinal studies are needed to disentangle which aspects of the complement system and complement activation affect the different processes in human cardiometabolic disease. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Cardiovascular disease; Complement system; Diabetes; Fatty liver disease; Insulin resistance; Obesity,antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; antilipemic agent; antioxidant; complement component C1q; complement component C1r; complement component C1s; complement component C2; complement component C3; complement component C3a; complement component C5; complement component C5a; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement factor H; complement receptor; high density lipoprotein; kinin; lectin; selenium; vitronectin; adipose tissue; cardiometabolic risk; cardiovascular disease; complement activation; complement system; fatty liver; fibrinolysis; human; inflammation; insulin resistance; lifestyle; liver disease; liver dysfunction; metabolic disorder; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; priority journal; review; Cardiovascular disease; Complement system; Diabetes; Fatty liver disease; Insulin resistance; Obesity; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; Complement System Proteins; Humans; Inflammation; Insulin Resistance; Metabolic Diseases,Elsevier Ltd
Pressurized CEC coupled with QTOF-MS for urinary metabolomics,"Wu Q., Yu X., Wang Y., Gu X., Ma X., Lv W., Chen Z., Yan C.",2014,Electrophoresis,"Pressurized CEC (pCEC) coupled with ESI-QTOF-MS using a sheathless interface was applied for metabolomics to develop an alternative analytical method for metabolic profiling of complex biofluid samples such as urine. The hyphenated system was investigated with mixed standards and pooled urine samples to evaluate its precision, repeatability, linearity, sensitivity, and selectivity. The applied voltage, mobile phase, and gradient elution were optimized and applied for the analysis of urinary metabolites. Multivariate data analysis was subsequently performed and used to distinguish lung cancer patients from healthy controls successfully. High separation efficiency has been achieved in pCEC due to the EOF. For metabolite identification, the pCEC-MS separation mechnism was helpful for discriminating the fragment ions of glutamine conjugates from co-eluted metabolites. Three glutamine conjugates, including phenylacetylglutamine, acylglutamine C8:1, and acylglutamine C6:1 were identified among 16 differential urinary metabolites of lung cancer. Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis of acylglutamine C8:1 resulted in an area-under-curve value of 0.882. Overall, this work suggests that this pCEC-ESI-QTOF-MS method may provide a novel and useful platform for metabolomic studies due to its superior separation and identification. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Fate and effects of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the aquatic environment: A review,"Ahrens L., Bundschuh M.",2014,Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are distributed ubiquitously in the aquatic environment, which raises concern for the flora and fauna in hydrosystems. The present critical review focuses on the fate and adverse effects of PFASs in the aquatic environment. The PFASs are continuously emitted into the environment from point and nonpoint sources such as sewage treatment plants and atmospheric deposition, respectively. Although concentrations of single substances may be too low to cause adverse effects, their mixtures can be of significant environmental concern. The production of C8-based PFASs (i.e., perfluorooctane sulfonate [PFOS] and perfluorooctanoate [PFOA]) is largely phased out; however, the emissions of other PFASs, in particular short-chain PFASs and PFAS precursors, are increasing. The PFAS precursors can finally degrade to persistent degradation products, which are, in particular, perfluoroalkane sulfonates (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs). In the environment, PFSAs and PFCAs are subject to partitioning processes, whereby short-chain PFSAs and PFCAs are mainly distributed in the water phase, whereas long-chain PFSAs and PFCAs tend to bind to particles and have a substantial bioaccumulation potential. However, there are fundamental knowledge gaps about the interactive toxicity of PFAS precursors and their persistent degradation products but also interactions with other natural and anthropogenic stressors. Moreover, because of the continuous emission of PFASs, further information about their ecotoxicological potential among multiple generations, species interactions, and mixture toxicity seems fundamental to reliably assess the risks for PFASs to affect ecosystem structure and function in the aquatic environment. © 2014 SETAC.",Aquatic environment; Effects; Fate; Multiple stressors; Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS); Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs); Species interaction; Toxicity,"Biochemistry; Carboxylation; Degradation; Ecosystems; Meteorological problems; Mixtures; Risk assessment; Sewage treatment plants; Toxicity; Aquatic environments; Effects; Fate; Multiple stressors; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Species interactions; Chains; acetic acid derivative; albumin; alcohol derivative; aldehyde derivative; carboxylic acid derivative; fatty acid binding protein; fluorine derivative; industrial toxic substance; n:2 fluorotelomer alcohol derivative; n:2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid derivative; n:2 fluorotelomer saturated aldehyde derivative; n:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated aldehyde derivative; n:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid derivative; organic matter; organophosphate; perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid derivative; perfluoroalkyl phosphonic acid derivative; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluoroalkyl sulfonamidoacetic acid derivative; perfluoroalkyl sulfonamidoethanol derivative; phosphonic acid derivative; polyfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid ester derivative; polyfluoroalkyl substance; runoff; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; x:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid derivative; aquatic community; aquatic environment; bioaccumulation; ecotoxicology; emission; literature review; nonpoint source pollution; organic compound; pollution effect; sewage treatment; acute toxicity; adverse outcome; aquatic environment; article; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric transport; binding affinity; bioaccumulation; biodegradation; biosolid; biotransformation; chronic toxicity; concentration (parameters); ecotoxicity; environmental impact; food web; gene expression; green alga; hydrophobicity; industrial waste; invertebrate; leaf litter; nonhuman; oxidative stress; Photobacterium phosphoreum; physical chemistry; priority journal; sewage treatment plant; water contamination; water pollution; zebra fish; Aquatic environment; Effects; Fate; Multiple stressors; Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS); Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs); Species interaction; Toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Caprylates; Ecotoxicology; Fluorocarbons; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Wiley Blackwell

Follicular and scarring disorders in skin of color: Presentation and management,"Madu P., Kundu R.V.",2014,American Journal of Clinical Dermatology,"Skin of color, also known as ethnic skin, is described as skin of individuals of African, Asian, Hispanic, Native-American, Middle Eastern, and Pacific Island backgrounds. Differences in hair morphology, hair grooming, cultural practices, and susceptibility to keloid scarring exist within these populations and have been implicated in hair, scalp, and skin disorders. Acne keloidalis (AK), central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA), dissecting cellulitis of the scalp (DCS), pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB), traction alopecia (TA), and keloids are the most prevalent follicular and scarring disorders in skin of color. They have been associated with disfigurement, permanent hair loss, emotional distress, and decreased quality of life. Hair grooming practices, such as the use of chemical relaxers, heat straightening, and tight braiding and weaving can cause scalp irritation and follicular damage and are linked to the pathogenesis of some of these conditions. Consequently, patient education and behavior modifications are integral to the prevention and management of these disorders. Scarring disorders are also of concern in ethnic populations. Keloid scarring is more prevalent in individuals of African, Asian, and Hispanic descent. The scarring alopecia CCCA is almost exclusively seen in patients of African descent. Therapeutic regimens such as intralesional corticosteroids, surgical excision, and laser therapy can be effective for these follicular and scarring disorders, but carry a risk of dyspigmentation and keloid scarring. Ethnic skin and hair may present unique challenges to the clinician, and knowledge of these differences is essential to providing quality care. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",,corticosteroid; acne; alopecia; behavior modification; central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia; clinical feature; corticosteroid therapy; dissecting cellulitis of the scalp; emotional stress; ethnic group; excision; follicular and scarring disorders in skin of color; folliculitis keloidalis; grooming; hair loss; human; keloid; low level laser therapy; pathogenesis; patient education; priority journal; pseudofolliculitis barbae; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; risk assessment; skin color; skin scar; systematic review (topic); traction alopecia; alopecia; ancestry group; Cicatrix; ethnology; hair follicle; pathology; scalp; Skin Diseases; skin pigmentation; Alopecia; Cicatrix; Continental Population Groups; Hair Follicle; Humans; Quality of Life; Scalp; Skin Diseases; Skin Pigmentation,Springer International Publishing
Diagnostic accuracy of transesophageal echocardiogram for the detection of patent foramen ovale: A meta-analysis,"Mojadidi M.K., Bogush N., Caceres J.D., Msaouel P., Tobis J.M.",2014,Echocardiography,"Background Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a remnant of the fetal circulation present in 20% of the population. Right-to-left shunting (RLS) through a PFO has been linked to the pathophysiology of stroke, migraine with aura, and hypoxemia. While different imaging modalities including transcranial Doppler, intra-cardiac echo, and transthoracic echo (TTE) have often been used to detect RLS, transesophageal echo (TEE) bubble study remains the gold standard for diagnosing PFO. The aim of this study was to determine the relative accuracy of TEE in the detection of PFO. Methods and Results A systematic review of Medline, using a standard approach for meta-analysis, was performed for all prospective studies assessing accuracy of TEE in the detection of PFO using confirmation by autopsy, cardiac surgery, and/or catheterization as the reference. Search results revealed 3105 studies; 4 met inclusion criteria. A total of 164 patients were included. TEE had a weighted sensitivity of 89.2% (95% CI: 81.1-94.7%) and specificity of 91.4% (95% CI: 82.3-96.8%) to detect PFO. The overall positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was 5.93 (95% CI: 1.30-27.09) and the overall negative likelihood ratio (LR-) was 0.22 (95% CI: 0.08-0.56). Conclusion While TEE bubble study is considered to be the gold standard modality for diagnosing PFO, some PFOs may still be missed or misdiagnosed. It is important to understand the limitations of TEE and perhaps use other highly sensitive screening tests, such as transcranial doppler (TCD), in conjunction with TEE before scheduling a patient for transcatheter PFO closure. © 2013, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",echocardiography; patent foramen ovale; TEE,"diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic error; diagnostic test accuracy study; heart right left shunt; human; meta analysis; patent foramen ovale; priority journal; review; sensitivity and specificity; transesophageal echocardiography; echography; female; Foramen Ovale, Patent; male; prevalence; reproducibility; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; transesophageal echocardiography; Echocardiography, Transesophageal; Female; Foramen Ovale, Patent; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity",Blackwell Publishing Inc.
QuEChERS sample preparation for the determination of pesticides and other organic residues in environmental matrices: A critical review,"Bruzzoniti M.C., Checchini L., De Carlo R.M., Orlandini S., Rivoira L., Del Bubba M.",2014,Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry,"Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) is an extraction and clean-up technique originally developed for recovering pesticide residues from fruits and vegetables. Since its introduction, and until December 2013, about 700 papers have been published using the QuEChERS technique, according to a literature overview carried out using SciFinder, Elsevier SciVerse, and Google search engines. Most of these papers were dedicated to pesticide multiresidue analysis in food matrices, and this topic has been thoroughly reviewed over recent years. The QuEChERS approach is now rapidly developing beyond its original field of application to analytes other than pesticides, and matrices other than food, such as biological fluids and non-edible plants, including Chinese medicinal plants. Recently, the QuEChERS concept has spread to environmental applications by analyzing not only pesticides but also other compounds of environmental concern in soil, sediments, and water. To the best of our knowledge, QuEChERS environmental applications have not been reviewed so far; therefore, in this contribution, after a general discussion on the evolution and changes of the original QuEChERS method, a critical survey of the literature regarding environmental applications of conventional and modified QuEChERS methodology is provided. The overall recoveries obtained with QuEChERS and other extraction approaches (e.g., accelerated solvent extraction, ultrasonic solvent extraction, liquid/solid extraction, and soxhlet extraction) were compared, providing evidence for QuEChERS higher recoveries for various classes of compounds, such as biopesticides, chloroalkanes, phenols, and perfluoroalkyl substances. The role of physicochemical properties of soil (i.e., clay and organic carbon content, as well as cation exchange capacity) and target analytes (i.e., log KOW, water solubility, and vapor pressure) were also evaluated in order to interpret recovery and matrix effect data. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Environmental pollutants; QuEChERS; Sediment; Soil; Water,"Chemical analysis; Electrophoresis; Pesticides; Recovery; Search engines; Sediments; Soils; Solvent extraction; Water; Water pollution; Accelerated solvent extraction; Cation exchange capacities; Environmental applications; Environmental pollutants; Physicochemical properties of soils; Quechers; Quick , Easy , Cheap , Effective , Rugged , and Safe; Ultrasonic solvent extraction; Chemical contamination; organic compound; pesticide residue; pollutant; analysis; food contamination; fractionation; isolation and purification; pollutant; procedures; Chemical Fractionation; Environmental Pollutants; Food Contamination; Organic Chemicals; Pesticide Residues",Springer Verlag
Multi-way analysis for decadal pollution trends assessment: The Guadalquivir River estuary as a case study,"López-López J.A., Mendiguchía C., García-Vargas M., Moreno C.",2014,Chemosphere,"Alongside history, human activities have contributed to the deployment of environmental quality. In particular, during the last decades the problem of water preservation has gained increasing attention. Statistical analysis is essential to analyze environmental data and to identify trends of pollutants over space and time. Usually applied techniques for data treatment are based on the organization of data in a two-way array, missing some shades on pollutants distribution. This fact supports the use of multi-way techniques, which allow the analysis of the results through different directions at the same time. For Three Modes Principal Components Analysis (3MPCA) a principal components analysis is conducted using three modes and a ""core"" matrix that allows assessing their interactions. In the case of environmental studies, it offers information about the spatial-temporal evolution of pollutants in a certain water body. The Guadalquivir River estuary has been used as a model system. It is a representative human influenced system, where different pollution inputs have been characterized. In this study, decadal evolution of pollutants has been discussed, to evaluate among others the effects of EU legislation on river water quality. The aim of this work is the establishment of the evolution, during the last decade, of nutrients and metals ultra-traces distribution in an estuary affected by anthropic activities. As examples, Pb and PO43- show a trend to decrease their weight on water pollution, total suspended solids (TSS) behavior is related with massive rain events, and the rising of new technologies appears as a source of emerging pollutants as Co in urban-industrial areas. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Anthropogenic pollution; Long term evolution; Metal traces; Multi-way analysis; Nutrients,"Estuaries; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Metal analysis; Nutrients; Principal component analysis; Quality control; Rivers; Water quality; Anthropogenic pollution; Environmental studies; Metal traces; Multi-way analysis; Pollutants distribution; Principal components analysis; Spatial-temporal evolution; Total suspended solids; River pollution; metal; river water; anthropogenic source; cobalt; environmental degradation; estuarine pollution; nutrient dynamics; principal component analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal evolution; trace metal; trend analysis; article; case study; dynamics; estuary; human; human activities; industrial area; nutrient; pollutant; suspended particulate matter; time; urban area; water pollution; weight; Andalucia; Guadalquivir Estuary; Spain; Anthropogenic pollution; Long term evolution; Metal traces; Multi-way analysis; Nutrients; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Environmental Monitoring; Estuaries; Fresh Water; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Micronutrients; Models, Theoretical; Principal Component Analysis; Rivers; Seasons; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality",Elsevier Ltd
Analysis of Trace Metals and Perfluorinated Compounds in 43 Representative Tea Products from South China,"Zheng H., Li J.-L., Li H.-H., Hu G.-C., Li H.-S.",2014,Journal of Food Science,"Six trace metals (Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Mn) and 2 perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), were analyzed in 43 representative tea products (including 18 green, 12 Oolong, and 13 black teas) from 7 main tea production provinces in China, using the atomic absorption spectrophotometer for trace metals analysis and HPLC-MS/MS for PFOS and PFOA analysis. The average contents of the 3 essential metals Mn, Cu, and Zn ions in the tea samples were 629.74, 17.75, and 37.38 mg/kg, whereas 3 toxic metals Cd, Cr, and Pb were 0.65, 1.02, and 1.92 mg/kg, respectively. The contents of heavy metals in the 3 types of tea were in the order of black tea > Oolong tea > green tea. Both PFOS and PFOA contents were low and PFOA content was higher than PFOS in the tea samples. The highest concentration of PFOA was 0.25 ng/g dry weight found in a Hunan green tea. The Principal component analysis was performed with the trace metals and PFCs to analyze the relationships of these indices. The results showed that black teas had higher trace metals and PFCs than green and Oolong teas, and the teas from Hunan and Zhejiang provinces had higher Pb and Cr than others. © 2014 Institute of Food Technologists®.",Perfluorooctane sulfonate; Perfluorooctanoic acid; South China; Tea; Trace metals,"alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; heavy metal; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; tea; trace element; analysis; Camellia sinensis; chemistry; China; food contamination; high performance liquid chromatography; human; tandem mass spectrometry; tea; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Camellia sinensis; Caprylates; China; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Fluorocarbons; Food Contamination; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Tea; Trace Elements",Blackwell Publishing Inc.
"Obesogenic effects of endocrine disruptors, what do we know from animal and human studies?","De Cock M., Van de Bor M.",2014,Environment International,"Background: Hormonal actions and activation of receptors involved in adipogenesis and brain development during the prenatal period may be affected by exposure to certain chemicals. Experimental studies have shown that amongst others polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-153 and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) may have obesogenic effects in prenatally exposed mice. Objective: To provide an overview of five classes of chemicals which have frequently been indicated as potential obesogens, and to discuss the evidence available regarding early life exposure to these compounds and overweight later in life. Methods: Pubmed was systematically searched for publications which related early life exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) to growth parameters later in life. We included 19 studies, which were published from 1995 and onwards. Results: Both positive and negative associations are observed between early life exposure and weight or height at various ages, including as early as 14. months, as well as until 20. years of age. In none of the included studies negative associations between perinatal exposure to EDCs and body mass index (BMI) were found and in several studies a positive association was observed. Dose-response relations appear to be non-monotonic. Conclusion: For certain EDCs, early life exposure may be associated with weight homeostasis later in life, however not necessarily in an obesogenic direction. More sensitive measures of adiposity as well as long-term follow-up are warranted for future studies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Endocrine disruption; Fetal basis of adult disease; Obesity,"Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane; Dose-response relations; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Endocrine disruption; Endocrine disruptor; Long-term follow-up; Obesity; Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB); Endocrine disrupters; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; brominated flame retardant; chlorphenotane; dioxin like compound; endocrine disruptor; hexachlorobenzene; non dioxin like compound; organochlorine pesticide; organotin compound; perfluorinated alkyl acid; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; phthalic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; unclassified drug; body mass; brain; DDT; dose-response relationship; endocrine disruptor; experimental study; obesity; PCB; adipogenesis; age; article; body height; body mass; body weight; dose response; growth curve; homeostasis; human; obesity; perinatal drug exposure; physical development; priority journal; systematic review; Endocrine disruption; Fetal basis of adult disease; Obesity; Animals; DDT; Disease Models, Animal; Endocrine Disruptors; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Mice; Obesity; Polychlorinated Biphenyls",Elsevier Ltd
Presbyopia-correcting intraocular lenses and corneal refractive procedures: A review for retinal surgeons,"Ahmad B.U., Shah G.K., Hardten D.R.",2014,Retina,"PURPOSE:: To review the specific challenges and pitfalls that vitreoretinal surgeons may face when operating on eyes with presbyopia-correcting intraocular lenses or previous corneal refractive surgery. In addition, this review aims to familiarize vitreoretinal surgeons with specifications of currently available Food and Drug Administration-approved presbyopia-correcting intraocular lenses. METHODS:: Review of current literature performed with PubMed for search terms ""presbyopia,"" ""correction,"" ""IOL,"" ""vitreoretinal,"" ""challenges,"" and ""surgical"" both singly and in combination as well as closely related terms. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION:: Specific intraoperative issues with presbyopia-correcting intraocular lenses that may be encountered include peripheral visualization, condensation, lens material issues particularly with silicone oil, decentration, Z-syndrome, and foveal image displacement. Every patient undergoing retinal surgery should also be asked about previous laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis/photorefractive keratectomy because those eyes require special attention to surface hydration and care to avoid epithelial removal if possible. Intracorneal ring segments and corneal inlays can cause effects similar to those of a small pupil. However, these can be managed with thorough preoperative evaluation and various intraoperative maneuvers. In addition, retinal physicians should be aware that macular disorders, such as age-related macular degeneration, may be exacerbated by potential loss of contrast sensitivity.© Ophthalmic Communication society,Inc.",Challenges/complications; Contrast sensitivity; Corneal inlay; Decentration; Intraocular lens; Multifocal; Premium; Presbyopia; Vitrectomy; Vitreoretinal surgery; Z-syndrome,"perfluorooctane; silicone oil; capsulorhexis; capsulotomy; cataract extraction; central serous retinopathy; contrast sensitivity; cornea surgery; corneal inlay; diabetic macular edema; epiretinal membrane; health care cost; human; hydration; intraocular pressure; intrastromal corneal ring segment; laser epithelial keratomileusis; lens implant; low level laser therapy; multifocal lens; ophthalmic forceps; photorefractive keratectomy; postoperative complication; preoperative evaluation; presbyopia; pupil; refractive surgery; retina detachment; retina image; retina macula age related degeneration; retina macula hole; review; surgeon; systematic review; vitrectomy; YAG laser; z syndrome; lens implantation; presbyopia; procedures; vitreoretinal surgery; Humans; Lens Implantation, Intraocular; Lenses, Intraocular; Presbyopia; Vitreoretinal Surgery",Lippincott Williams and Wilkins
Critical review of electrochemical advanced oxidation processes for water treatment applications,Chaplin B.P.,2014,Environmental Sciences: Processes and Impacts,"Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have emerged as novel water treatment technologies for the elimination of a broad-range of organic contaminants. Considerable validation of this technology has been performed at both the bench-scale and pilot-scale, which has been facilitated by the development of stable electrode materials that efficiently generate high yields of hydroxyl radicals (OH) (e.g., boron-doped diamond (BDD), doped-SnO 2, PbO2, and substoichiometic- and doped-TiO2). Although a promising new technology, the mechanisms involved in the oxidation of organic compounds during EAOPs and the corresponding environmental impacts of their use have not been fully addressed. In order to unify the state of knowledge, identify research gaps, and stimulate new research in these areas, this review critically analyses published research pertaining to EAOPs. Specific topics covered in this review include (1) EAOP electrode types, (2) oxidation pathways of select classes of contaminants, (3) rate limitations in applied settings, and (4) long-term sustainability. Key challenges facing EAOP technologies are related to toxic byproduct formation (e.g., ClO 4- and halogenated organic compounds) and low electro-active surface areas. These challenges must be addressed in future research in order for EAOPs to realize their full potential for water treatment. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.",,acetic acid; boron; diamond; formic acid; iridium; lead; niobium; organic carbon; organic compound; oxalic acid; oxygen; perfluoro compound; phenol derivative; tin; titanium; titanium dioxide; water; adsorption; advection; aqueous solution; chemical reaction; corrosion; crystal structure; electric conductivity; electrochemical advanced oxidation process; electrochemical analysis; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; electrochemistry; electrode; electron transport; environmental impact; hydrophobicity; oxidation; oxygen evolution; packed bed reactor; priority journal; reaction analysis; reduction; review; scanning electrochemical microscopy; waste water management; Boron; Diamond; Electrodes; Oxidation-Reduction; Water Pollutants; Water Purification,Royal Society of Chemistry
A critical review of perfluorooctanoate and perfluorooctanesulfonate exposure and cancer risk in humans,"Chang E.T., Adami H.-O., Boffetta P., Cole P., Starr T.B., Mandel J.S.",2014,Critical Reviews in Toxicology,"Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) are ubiquitous synthetic chemicals with no known effect on human cancer development. This article systematically and critically reviews the epidemiologic evidence regarding the association between PFOA and PFOS exposure and cancer risk in humans. Eighteen epidemiologic studies-eight of PFOA, four of PFOS, and six of both PFOA and PFOS-have estimated associations of exposure to these chemicals with cancer incidence or mortality, with studies equally divided between occupational and nonoccupational settings. Although some statistically significant positive associations have been reported, for example, with cancers of the prostate, kidney, testis, and thyroid, the majority of relative risk estimates for both PFOA and PFOS have been between 0.5 and 2.0 (with 95% confidence intervals including 1.0), inconsistently detected across studies, counterbalanced by negative associations, not indicative of a monotonic exposure-response relationship, and not coherent with toxicological evidence in animals, in which the primary target organs are the liver, testis (Leydig cells), and pancreas (acinar cells). Many positive associations with PFOA exposure were detected in community settings without occupational exposure and were not supported by results in exposed workers. Given that occupational exposure to PFOA and PFOS is one to two orders of magnitude higher than environmental exposure, the discrepant positive findings are likely due to chance, confounding, and/or bias. Taken together, the epidemiologic evidence does not support the hypothesis of a causal association between PFOA or PFOS exposure and cancer in humans. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",Ammonium perfluorooctanoate; Cancer; Epidemiology; Humans; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Perfluorooctanesulfonate; Perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride; Perfluorooctanoate,perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; cancer epidemiology; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer risk; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; disease association; environmental exposure; Europe; experimental rat; health care facility; human; kidney cancer; liver cancer; neoplasm; nonhuman; occupational exposure; pancreas cancer; population exposure; prostate cancer; review; systematic review; testis cancer; thyroid cancer; United States; worker; adverse effects; animal; Neoplasms; pathology; risk; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Caprylates; Environmental Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Neoplasms; Occupational Exposure; Risk,Informa Healthcare
Biodegradation of C5-C8 fatty acids and production of aroma volatiles by Myroides sp. ZB35 isolated from activated sludge,"Xiao Z., Zhu X., Xi L., Hou X., Fang L., Lu J.R.",2014,Journal of Microbiology,"In the effluents of a biologically treated wastewater from a heavy oil-refining plant, C5-C8 fatty acids including pentanoic acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, octanoic acid, and 2-methylbutanoic acid are often detected. As these residual fatty acids can cause further air and water pollution, a new Myroides isolate ZB35 from activated sludge was explored to degrade these C5-C8 fatty acids in this study. It was found that the biodegradation process involved a lag phase that became prolonged with increasing acyl chain length when the fatty acids were individually fed to this strain. However, when fed as a mixture, the ones with longer acyl chains were found to become more quickly assimilated. The branched 2-methylbutanoic acid was always the last one to be depleted among the five fatty acids under both conditions. Metabolite analysis revealed one possible origin of short chain fatty acids in the biologically treated wastewater. Aroma volatiles including 2-methylbutyl isovalerate, isoamyl 2-methylbutanoate, isoamyl isovalerate, and 2-methylbutyl 2-methylbutanoate were subsequently identified from ZB35 extracts, linking the source of the fruity odor to these esters excreted by Myroides species. To our best knowledge, this is the first finding of these aroma esters in bacteria. From a biotechnological viewpoint, this study has revealed the potential of Myroides species as a promising source of aroma esters attractive for food and fragrance industries. © 2014 The Microbiological Society of Korea and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",aroma esters; biodegradation; Myroides; pathway,"bacterial DNA; fatty acid; ribosome DNA; RNA 16S; sewage; volatile organic compound; waste water; water pollutant; biotransformation; chemistry; DNA sequence; Flavobacteriaceae; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; molecular genetics; sewage; waste water; water pollutant; Biotransformation; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Fatty Acids; Flavobacteriaceae; Molecular Sequence Data; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sewage; Volatile Organic Compounds; Waste Water; Water Pollutants",Microbiological Society of Korea
Water fluoridation: A critical review of the physiological effects of ingested fluoride as a public health intervention,"Peckham S., Awofeso N.",2014,The Scientific World Journal,"Fluorine is the world's 13th most abundant element and constitutes 0.08% of the Earth crust. It has the highest electronegativity of all elements. Fluoride is widely distributed in the environment, occurring in the air, soils, rocks, and water. Although fluoride is used industrially in a fluorine compound, the manufacture of ceramics, pesticides, aerosol propellants, refrigerants, glassware, and Teflon cookware, it is a generally unwanted byproduct of aluminium, fertilizer, and iron ore manufacture. The medicinal use of fluorides for the prevention of dental caries began in January 1945 when community water supplies in Grand Rapids, United States, were fluoridated to a level of 1 ppm as a dental caries prevention measure. However, water fluoridation remains a controversial public health measure. This paper reviews the human health effects of fluoride. The authors conclude that available evidence suggests that fluoride has a potential to cause major adverse human health problems, while having only a modest dental caries prevention effect. As part of efforts to reduce hazardous fluoride ingestion, the practice of artificial water fluoridation should be reconsidered globally, while industrial safety measures need to be tightened in order to reduce unethical discharge of fluoride compounds into the environment. Public health approaches for global dental caries reduction that do not involve systemic ingestion of fluoride are urgently needed. © 2014 Stephen Peckham and Niyi Awofeso.",,fluorapatite; fluoride; drinking water; fluoride; bioethics; caries prevention; cognitive defect; cognitive development; dental caries; dental fluorosis; fluid intake; fluoridation; health care policy; human; hypothyroidism; intelligence quotient; meta analysis (topic); mouth hygiene; neurotoxicity; occupational safety; ossification; osteofluorosis; osteolysis; public health; review; water supply; chemistry; public health; Drinking Water; Fluoridation; Fluorides; Humans; Public Health,ScientificWorld Ltd.
"Development and validation of HPLC-UV method for simultaneous determination of nevirapine, 2-OH nevirapine and 3-OH nevirapine in human plasma","Mustafa S., Wan Yusoff W.N., Badriah Hassan N.",2014,International Journal of PharmTech Research,"A simple, selective, precise, and accurate HPLC method has been developed and validated for analysis of nevirapine, 2-hydroxy nevirapine and 3-hydroxy nevirapine. Reversed-phase chromatography was performed on a C8 column with ammonium acetate-acetonitrile, 80:20 (%, v/v) as mobile phase at a gradient flow rate of 1ml/min for 17 minutes and increased to 2ml/min with analysis time of 30 min.

Linear regression analysis data for the calibration plot showed there was a good linear relationship between response and concentration for nevirapine and the oxidative metabolites with regression coefficient value, r2 were &gt; 0.99. The method was validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. In this paper, we used UV detection for the simultaneous detection of nevirapine and two of its major oxidative metabolites and the results were satisfactory. UV detection is simple and available to most analytical laboratories. In addition, this method involves a simple liquid-liquid extraction with good reproducibility, which makes it suitable for pharmaco - kinetic study.",2-hydroxy nevirapine; 3-hydroxy nevirapine; Nevirapine,,

Understanding short-side-chain perfluorinated sulfonic acid and its application for high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells,"Li J., Pan M., Tang H.",2014,RSC Advances,"The great demand for high-temperature operation of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) has been well answered by short-side-chain perfluorinated sulfonic acid (SSC-PFSA) membranes through a good balance between transport properties and stability. It has been evidenced that fuel cells assembled with SSC-PFSA possess higher and more stable performance at elevated temperature up to 130 °C compared to that of fuel cells based on conventional long-side-chain (LSC) PFSA (Nafion®) membranes. Moreover, the shorter side-pendent chains and the absence of the ether group and of the tertiary carbon also endow SSC-PFSAs with better durability, making them more suitable for working at harsh conditions in fuel cell systems. This critical review is dedicated to summarizing the properties of SSC-PFSA and providing insight into an understanding of their micro-morphologies, mass diffusion, enhanced proton transportation and their mutual correlation. Diversified measurement techniques applied to investigate the evolution of micro-morphologies, unique diffusion and transportation properties of SSC-PFSAs are reviewed. Despite the higher crystalline and higher water absorption of SSC-PFSAs than those of LSC-PFSAs, the notably less developed and less interconnected ionic clusters in SSC-PFSAs lead to lower mass permeability, and hence the high water uptake is not as well translated into transportation performance as expected. The factors and reasons for the enhanced electrochemical performance of SSC-PFSAs such as higher proton conductivity at elevated temperatures and low humidity conditions are also discussed and understood. Highlights of recent advances in SSC-PFSA-based membranes for fuel cell applications at wider temperature ranges are summarized as general references for researchers to further prompt the development of SSC-PFSAs. The SSC-PFSAs based membranes give a bright future for the next generation of high-temperature PEMFCs. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Electrochemical performance; Fuel cell application; High temperature polymer electrolyte membranes; Low humidity conditions; Measurement techniques; Perfluorinated sulfonic acid; Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFCs); Transportation properties; Chains; Electrolytes; Mass transportation; Morphology; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC),
2013 Atomic spectrometry update - A review of advances in environmental analysis,"Butler O.T., Cairns W.R.L., Cook J.M., Davidson C.M.",2014,Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry,"This is the 29th annual review of the application of atomic spectrometry to the chemical analysis of environmental samples. This Update refers to papers published approximately between September 2012 and July 2013 and continues the series of Atomic Spectrometry Updates (ASUs) in Environmental Analysis 1 that should be read in conjunction with other related ASUs in the series namely: clinical and biological materials, foods and beverages; 2 advances in atomic spectrometry and related techniques;3 elemental speciation;3 X-ray spectrometry4 and advances in the analysis of metals, chemicals and materials.5 In the field of air analysis, highlights within this review period include measuring the bioaccessible fraction of metals in particles and ongoing work in assessing the performance of optical and combustion techniques for the determination of the carbonaceous content of airborne particulate matter. Developments in instrumentation included new sampler designs for the collection of nanoparticles, the coupling of FFF and hydrodynamic chromatography to ICP-MS for the sizing and compositional analysis of such particles and the ongoing development of aerosol mass spectrometry. In the field of water analysis, new procedures for the detection and quantification of emerging pollutants in water such as MRI contrast agents have been developed. Instrumental developments reported include the use of molecular absorption spectrometry, by exploiting the CS-AAS technique, for measuring halogen species in water. Numerous articles involving the application of atomic spectrometry to plants, soils and related materials appeared in this review period but, as usual, most were concerned with the environmental significance of the results, rather than the methodology used to obtain them. Nevertheless, there have been some interesting developments. Both LIBS and PXRF spectrometry have been used more widely, variants such as LA-LIBS and microwave assisted LIBS have appeared, and PXRF spectrometry has been applied for the first time in the analysis of plants. Developments in geochemical analysis include the production and (re)certification of new geological RMs for bulk, isotopic and microspatial analysis. Optimisation of LA-ICP-MS techniques for the interrogation of geochemical samples continues to be reported and a number of useful instrumental review articles (AMS, ICP-MS and SIMS) have been published.

Should we close patent foramen ovale in patients with cryptogenic stroke? [Czy nalezy zamykać przetrwały otwór owalny u pacjentów z kryptogennym udarem mózgu?],"Hrynkiewicz-Szymańska A., Braksator W.",2013,Polski Przeglad Kardiologiczny,"Some parts of cryptogenic strokes may by the result of paradoxical embolism via patent foramen ovale (PFO). The prevalence of PFO in patients younger than 55 years who have a cryptogenic stroke is approximately 55%. The association of PFO with cryptogenic stroke has been confirmed in meta-analyses. For secondary prevention of cryptogenic stroke, closure of the PFO or medical treatment are recommended. Previous meta-analyses of observational studies have suggested significant benefit of transcathether PFO closure in comparison with medical therapy. The results of the randomized trials comparing percutaneous closure of the PFO with medical treatment in patients with cryptogenic embolism were published in 2012 and 2013. All three trials have failed to show benefits associated with the PFO closure in patients with a cryptogenic stroke. The most effective strategy for secondary prevention of cryptogenic embolism in patients with PFOs is still uncertain.

The metabolic signature associated with the Western dietary pattern: A cross-sectional study,"Bouchard-Mercier A., Rudkowska I., Lemieux S., Couture P., Vohl M.-C.",2013,Nutrition Journal,"Background: Metabolic profiles have been shown to be associated to obesity status and insulin sensitivity. Dietary intakes influence metabolic pathways and therefore, different dietary patterns may relate to modifications in metabolic signatures. The objective was to verify associations between dietary patterns and metabolic profiles composed of amino acids (AAs) and acylcarnitines (ACs). Methods. 210 participants were recruited in the greater Quebec City area between September 2009 and December 2011. Dietary patterns had been previously derived using principal component analysis (PCA). The Prudent dietary pattern was characterised by higher intakes of vegetables, fruits, whole grain products, non-hydrogenated fat and lower intakes of refined grain products, whereas the Western dietary pattern was associated with higher intakes of refined grain products, desserts, sweets and processed meats. Targeted metabolites were quantified in 37 participants with the Biocrates Absolute IDQ p150 (Biocrates Life Sciences AG, Austria) mass spectrometry method (including 14 amino acids and 41 acylcarnitines). Results: PCA analysis with metabolites including AAs and ACs revealed two main components explaining the most variance in overall data (13.8%). PC1 was composed mostly of medium- to long-chain ACs (C16:2, C14:2, C14:2-OH, C16, C14:1-OH, C14:1, C10:2, C5-DC/C6-OH, C12, C18:2, C10, C4:1-DC/C6, C8:1 and C2) whereas PC2 included certain AAs and short-chain ACs (xLeu, Met, Arg, Phe, Pro, Orn, His, C0, C3, C4 and C5). The Western dietary pattern correlated negatively with PC1 and positively with PC2 (r = -0.34, p = 0.05 and r = 0.38, p = 0.03, respectively), independently of age, sex and BMI. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the Western dietary pattern is associated with a specific metabolite signature characterized by increased levels of AAs including branched-chain AAs (BCAAs) and short-chain ACs.

Dosimetric anchoring of In vivo and In vitro studies for perfluorooctanoate and perfluorooctanesulfonate,"Wambaugh J.F., Setzer R.W., Pitruzzello A.M., Liu J., Reif D.M., Kleinstreuer N.C., Wang N.C.Y., Sipes N., Martin M., Das K., DeWitt J.C., Strynar M., Judson R., Houck K.A., Lau C.",2013,Toxicological Sciences,"In order to compare between in vivo toxicity studies, dosimetry is needed to translate study-specific dose regimens into dose metrics such as tissue concentration. These tissue concentrations may then be compared with in vitro bioactivity assays to perhaps identify mechanisms relevant to the lowest observed effect level (LOEL) dose group and the onset of the observed in vivo toxicity. Here, we examine the perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS). We analyzed 9 in vivo toxicity studies for PFOA and 13 in vivo toxicity studies for PFOS. Both PFCs caused multiple effects in various test species, strains, and genders. We used a Bayesian pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling framework to incorporate data from 6 PFOA PK studies and 2 PFOS PK studies (conducted in 3 species) to predict dose metrics for the in vivo LOELs and no observed effect levels (NOELs). We estimated PK parameters for 11 combinations of chemical, species, strain, and gender. Despite divergent study designs and species-specific PK, for a given effect, we found that the predicted dose metrics corresponding to the LOELs (and NOELs where available) occur at similar concentrations. In vitro assay results for PFOA and PFOS from EPA's ToxCast project were then examined. We found that most in vitro bioactivity occurs at concentrations lower than the predicted concentrations for the in vivo LOELs and higher than the predicted concentrations for the in vivo NOELs (where available), for a variety of nonimmunological effects. These results indicate that given sufficient PK data, the in vivo LOELs dose regimens, but not necessarily the effects, could have been predicted from in vitro studies for these 2 PFCs. © The Author 2013.

Do the divisome and elongasome share a common evolutionary past?,"Szwedziak P., Löwe J.",2013,Current Opinion in Microbiology,"The divisome and elongasome are bacterial protein complexes responsible for peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis during cell division and elongation, respectively. We review several lines of evidence, arguing for a shared evolutionary past of the divisome and elongasome. Both integrate closely related penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) for PG synthesis, use proteins of the RodA/FtsW (SEDS, shape, elongation, division and sporulation) family for Lipid II export and interact with MraY/Mur proteins for Lipid II synthesis. It was recently shown that the actin-like protein FtsA of the divisome polymerises on membranes, adding another parallel, since membrane-associated filaments of the bacterial actin MreB guide the elongasome. Given these similarities, it seems plausible to conclude that the elongasome is a modified version of the divisome, without the membrane-constricting FtsZ-ring and its associated machinery on the inside. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,ABC transporter; adenosine triphosphate; bacterial protein; carrier protein; disaccharide; divisome; elongasome; EnvC protein; FtsA protein; FtsK protein; FtsN protein; FtsQ protein; FtsW protein; gamma glutamyltransferase; glycan; glycosyltransferase; lipid; lipid II; membrane protein; membrane protein MraY; membrane protein MurF; membrane protein MurG; MreB protein; MreC protein; penicillin binding protein; penicillin binding protein 2; peptidoglycan; RodA protein; unclassified drug; amino acid sequence; Bacillus subtilis; carboxy terminal sequence; cell division; cell elongation; cell membrane; crystal structure; cytoplasm; enzyme activity; feedback system; hydrolysis; lipid transport; lipogenesis; molecular evolution; nonhuman; polymerization; protein binding; protein conformation; protein domain; protein function; protein lipid interaction; protein protein interaction; protein structure; protein synthesis; regulatory mechanism; review; Staphylococcus aureus; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacterial Proteins; Cell Division; Cell Wall; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Peptidoglycan,
An integrated metabonomics and transcriptomics approach to understanding metabolic pathway disturbance induced by perfluorooctanoic acid,"Peng S., Yan L., Zhang J., Wang Z., Tian M., Shen H.",2013,Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis,"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is one of the most representative perfluorinated compounds and liver is the major organ where PFOA is accumulated. Although the multiple toxicities had been reported, its toxicological profile remained unclear. In this study, a systems toxicology strategy integrating liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based metabonomics and transcriptomics analyses was applied for the first time to investigate the effects of PFOA on a representative Chinese normal human liver cell line L-02, with focusing on the metabolic disturbance. Fifteen potential biomarkers were identified on metabolic level and most observations were consistent with the altered levels of gene expression. Our results showed that PFOA induced the perturbations in various metabolic processes in L-02 cells, especially lipid metabolism-related pathways. The up-stream mitochondrial carnitine metabolism was proved to be influenced by PFOA treatment. The specific transformation from carnitine to acylcarnitines, which showed a dose-dependent effect, and the expression level of key genes involved in this pathway were observed to be altered correspondingly. Furthermore, the down-stream cholesterol biosynthesis was directly confirmed to be up-regulated by both increased cholesterol content and elevated expression level of key genes. The PFOA-induced lipid metabolism-related effects in L-02 cells started from the fatty acid catabolism in cytosol, fluctuated to the processes in mitochondria, extended to the cholesterol biosynthesis. Many other metabolic pathways like amino acid metabolism and tricarboxylic acid cycle might also be disturbed. The findings obtained from the systems biological research provide more details about metabolic disorders induced by PFOA in human liver. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Biomarker; Hepatotoxicity; Metabonomics; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Transcriptomics,"acylcarnitine; amino acid; biological marker; carnitine; cholesterol; lipid; perfluorooctanoic acid; tricarboxylic acid; amino acid metabolism; article; cell viability; cholesterol synthesis; citric acid cycle; cytosol; fatty acid oxidation; gene expression; human; human cell; lipid metabolism; liquid chromatography; liver toxicity; mass spectrometry; metabolism; metabolomics; microarray analysis; mitochondrion; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; transcriptomics; upregulation; Biomarker; Hepatotoxicity; Metabonomics; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Transcriptomics; Caprylates; Cell Line, Transformed; Cell Survival; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metabolomics; Pilot Projects; Transcriptome",

The characteristics of oil absorbability are given. The physicomechanical properties of impregnated samples compared with the samples fabricated using the traditional method are investigated. The fabricated materials have a decreased friction coefficient (by a factor of ∼1.25) and improved leak-tightness (the samples withstood a pressure of 25 atm for 1 min).

Fluorinated dendrimers as imaging agents for 19F MRI,Yu Y.B.,2013,Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Nanomedicine and Nanobiotechnology,"19F is the second most sensitive stable nucleus for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Because there is no endogenous 19F signal, 19F MRI is much more suited for quantification and tracking than 1H MRI. However, 19F MRI is not in clinical use because in spite of more than three decades of research, there are no approved 19F imaging agents. New approaches and new methodologies are needed to move the field forward. Water-soluble fluorinated dendrimers present a promising alternative to conventional perfluorocarbon emulsions. This article outlines recent development of fluorinated dendrimers as 19F imaging agents. This is not meant to be a comprehensive review of 19F imaging agents, for which there is an excellent recent review by Knight et al.

Review and prospect of emerging contaminants in waste - Key issues and challenges linked to their presence in waste treatment schemes: General aspects and focus on nanoparticles,"Marcoux M.-A., Matias M., Olivier F., Keck G.",2013,Waste Management,"The presence in waste of emerging pollutants (EPs), whose behaviours and effects are not well understood, may present unexpected health and environmental risks and risks for the treatment processes themselves. EP may include substances that are newly detected in the environment, substances already identified as risky and whose use in items is prohibited (but which may be present in old or imported product waste) or substances already known but whose recent use in products can cause problems during their future treatment as waste. Several scientific studies have been conducted to assess the presence of EP in waste, but they are mostly dedicated to a single category of substance or one particular waste treatment. In the absence of a comprehensive review focused on the impact of the presence of EP on waste treatment schemes, the authors present a review of the key issues associated with the treatment of waste containing emerging pollutants. This review presents the typologies of emerging pollutants that are potentially present in waste along with the major challenges for each treatment scheme (recycling, composting, digestion, incineration, landfilling and wastewater treatment). All conventional treatment processes are affected by these new pollutants, and they were almost never originally designed to consider these substances. In addition to these general aspects, a comprehensive review of available data, projects and future R&D needs related to the impact of nanoparticles on waste treatment is presented as a case study. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Anaerobic digestion; Composting; Emerging pollutant; Incineration; Landfilling; Nanowaste; Recycling; Waste; WWTP,Conventional treatments; Emerging contaminant; Emerging pollutants; Environmental risks; Landfilling; Nanowaste; Scientific studies; WWTP; Air pollution; Anaerobic digestion; Composting; Health risks; Incineration; Nanoparticles; Recycling; Wastes; Wastewater treatment; Waste incineration; nanoparticle; anoxic conditions; composting; environmental risk; health risk; incineration; landfill; particulate matter; pollutant; recycling; waste treatment; wastewater; water treatment; anaerobic digestion; article; composting; emerging pollutant in waste; environment; health hazard; incineration; landfill; priority journal; recycling; waste; waste management; waste water management; Anaerobic digestion; Composting; Emerging pollutant; Incineration; Landfilling; Nanowaste; Recycling; Waste; WWTP; Environmental Pollutants; Hazardous Waste; Nanoparticles; Waste Management,
Meta-analysis of toxicity and teratogenicity of 133 chemicals from zebrafish developmental toxicity studies,"Ducharme N.A., Peterson L.E., Benfenati E., Reif D., McCollum C.W., Gustafsson J.-T., Bondesson M.",2013,Reproductive Toxicology,"Zebrafish developmental toxicity testing is an emerging field, which faces considerable challenges regarding data meta-analysis and the establishment of standardized test protocols. Here, we present an initial correlation study on toxicity of 133 chemicals based on data in the literature to ascertain predictive developmental toxicity endpoints. We found that the physical properties of chemicals (BCF or log. P) did not fully predict lethality or developmental outcomes. Instead, individual outcomes such as pericardial edema and yolk sac edema were more reliable indicators of developmental toxicity. In addition, we ranked the chemicals based on toxicity with the Toxicological Priority Index (ToxPi) program and via a teratogenic ratio, and found that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) had the highest ToxPi score, triphenyltin acetate had the highest average ToxPi score (corrected for missing data and having more than 4 outcomes), and N-methyl-dithiocarbamate had the highest teratogenic ratio. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Developmental toxicity; Meta-analysis; Teratogen; ToxPi; Zebrafish,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; arsenic trioxide; atrazine; benzene; benzoic acid; cadmium; cadmium chloride; caffeine; carbaril; carbon disulfide; chemical compound; chromium; dichlorvos; dieldrin; dimethyl sulfoxide; dimpylate; lithium chloride; malathion; metham; nicotine; nonylphenol; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; retinoic acid; toluene; tributyltin; triphenyltin acetate; unclassified drug; valproic acid; article; blood flow; controlled study; developmental toxicity; ear malformation; edema; embryo; hatching; heart rate; LC 50; lethality; lipophilicity; neurologic disease; nonhuman; pericardial edema; physical parameters; scoring system; signal transduction; teratogenicity; toxicity testing; toxicological parameters; Toxicological Priority Index; yolk sac edema; zebra fish; Danio rerio; Developmental toxicity; Meta-analysis; Teratogen; ToxPi; Zebrafish; 1-Octanol; Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Teratogens; Toxicity Tests; Water; Zebrafish",
"Vanadium bisimide bonding investigated by X-ray crystallography, 51V and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and v L3,2-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy","La Pierre H.S., Minasian S.G., Abubekerov M., Kozimor S.A., Shuh D.K., Tyliszczak T., Arnold J., Bergman R.G., Toste F.D.",2013,Inorganic Chemistry,"Syntheses of neutral halide and aryl vanadium bisimides are described. Treatment of VCl2(NtBu)[NTMS(NtBu)], 2, with PMe 3, PEt3, PMe2Ph, or pyridine gave vanadium bisimides via TMSCl elimination in good yield: VCl(PMe3) 2(NtBu)2 3, VCl(PEt3) 2(NtBu)2 4, VCl(PMe2Ph) 2(NtBu)2 5, and VCl(Py)2(N tBu)2 6. The halide series (Cl-I) was synthesized by use of TMSBr and TMSI to give VBr(PMe3)2(NtBu) 2 7 and VI(PMe3)2(NtBu)2 8. The phenyl derivative was obtained by reaction of 3 with MgPh2 to give VPh(PMe3)2(NtBu)2 9. These neutral complexes are compared to the previously reported cationic bisimides [V(PMe3)3(NtBu)2][Al(PFTB) 4] 10, [V(PEt3)2(NtBu) 2][Al(PFTB)4] 11, and [V(DMAP)(PEt3) 2(NtBu)2][Al(PFTB)4] 12 (DMAP = dimethylaminopyridine, PFTB = perfluoro-tert-butoxide). Characterization of the complexes by X-ray diffraction, 13C NMR, 51V NMR, and V L3,2-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy provides a description of the electronic structure in comparison to group 6 bisimides and the bent metallocene analogues. The electronic structure is dominated by π bonding to the imides, and localization of electron density at the nitrogen atoms of the imides is dictated by the cone angle and donating ability of the axial neutral supporting ligands. This phenomenon is clearly seen in the sensitivity of 51V NMR shift, 13C NMR Δδαβ, and L3-edge energy to the nature of the supporting phosphine ligand, which defines the parameters for designing cationic group 5 bisimides that would be capable of breaking stronger σ bonds. Conversely, all three methods show little dependence on the variable equatorial halide ligand. Furthermore, this analysis allows for quantification of the electronic differences between vanadium bisimides and the structurally analogous mixed Cp/imide system CpV(NtBu)X2 (Cp = C5H51-). © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,,
Enantioselective separation of amino acids as biomarkers indicating life in extraterrestrial environments Amino Acid Analysis,Pietrogrande M.C.,2013,Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry,"Traces of prebiotic amino acids, i.e., the building blocks of proteins, are excellent biomarkers that could provide evidence of extinct or extant life in extra-terrestrial environments. In particular, characterization of the enantiomeric excess of amino acids gives relevant information about the biotic or abiotic origin of molecules, because it is generally assumed that life elsewhere could be based on either l or d amino acids, but not both. The analytical procedures used in in-situ space missions for chiral discrimination of amino acids must meet severe requirements imposed by flight conditions: short analysis time, low energy consumption, robustness, storage for long periods under extreme conditions, high efficiency and sensitivity, automation, and remote-control operation. Such methods are based on gas chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography, and capillary electrophoresis, usually coupled with mass spectrometry; of these, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is the only such combination yet used in space missions. Preliminary in-situ sample derivatization is required before GC-MS analysis to convert amino acids into volatile and thermally stable compounds. The silylation reagent most commonly used, N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide, is unsuitable for detection of homochirality, and alternative derivatization techniques have been developed that preserve the stereochemical configuration of the original compounds and are compatible with spaceflight conditions. These include the reagent N,N-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal, which has already been used in the Rosetta mission, a mixture of alkyl chloroformate, ethanol, and pyridine, a mixture of perfluorinated anhydrides and perfluoro alcohols, and hexafluoroacetone, the first gaseous derivatizing agent. In all the space instruments, solvent extraction of organic matter and chemical derivatization have been combined in a single automatic and remote-controlled procedure in a chemical reactor. Liquid-based separation systems have been used in space missions. In particular, microchip capillary electrophoresis, based on microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems, enables high-performance chemical analysis of amino acids with low mass and volume equipment and low power and reagent consumption. Coupling with laser-induced fluorescence detectors results in ultra-low limits of detection. This critical review describes applications of the on-board instruments used in the Rosetta mission to comets and in the more recent Mars exploration program, i.e., the Mars Science Laboratory and ExoMars missions.

But the river suffers from huge amounts of urban sewage, agricultural effluents, and industrial wastewater as well as ship navigation wastes along its course. With respect to the vast amounts of water and sediments discharged by the Yangtze River, it is reasonable to ask whether the pollution problem may be solved by simple dilution. This article reviews the past two decades of published research on organic pollutants in the Yangtze River and several adjacent water bodies connected to the main stream, according to a holistic approach. Organic pollutant levels and potential effects of water and sediments on wildlife and humans, measured in vitro, in vivo, and in situ, were critically reviewed. The contamination with organic pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and others, of water and sediment along the river was described. Especially Wuhan section and the Yangtze Estuary exhibited stronger pollution than other sections. Bioassays, displaying predominantly the endpoints mutagenicity and endocrine disruption, applied at sediments, drinking water, and surface water indicated a potential health risk in several areas. Aquatic organisms exhibited detectable concentrations of toxic compounds like PCBs, OCPs, PBDEs, and PFCs. Genotoxic effects could also be assessed in situ in fish. To summarize, it can be stated that dilution reduces the ecotoxicological risk in the Yangtze River, but does not eliminate it. Keeping in mind an approximately 14 times greater water discharge compared to the major European river Rhine, the absolute pollution mass transfer of the Yangtze River is of severe concern for the environmental quality of its estuary and the East China Sea. Based on the review, further research needs have been identified. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Bioassay; Ecotoxicity; Fish; Mutagenicity; Organic pollutants; Triad approach; Yangtze River,"benzofuran derivative; chlorinated dibenzofurans; chlorinated hydrocarbon; dibenzo(1,4)dioxin; dioxin; diphenyl ether derivative; pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; anthropogenic source; aquatic organism; bioaccumulation; bioassay; dilution; drinking water; ecotoxicology; endocrine disruptor; environmental risk; fish; genotoxicity; health risk; mutagenicity; organic pollutant; organochlorine; PAH; PBDE; PCB; pollutant transport; river pollution; sediment pollution; animal; article; chemistry; China; environmental monitoring; human; river; statistics; waste water; water pollutant; water pollution; Animals; Benzofurans; China; Dioxins; Environmental Monitoring; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Pesticides; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Rivers; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical; China; Yangtze River",
A computational approach to chemical etiologies of diabetes,"Audouze K., Brunak Sø., Grandjean P.",2013,Scientific Reports,"Computational meta-analysis can link environmental chemicals to genes and proteins involved in human diseases, thereby elucidating possible etiologies and pathogeneses of non-communicable diseases. We used an integrated computational systems biology approach to examine possible pathogenetic linkages in type 2 diabetes (T2D) through genome-wide associations, disease similarities, and published empirical evidence. Ten environmental chemicals were found to be potentially linked to T2D, the highest scores were observed for arsenic, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, hexachlorobenzene, and perfluorooctanoic acid. For these substances we integrated disease and pathway annotations on top of protein interactions to reveal possible pathogenetic pathways that deserve empirical testing. The approach is general and can address other public health concerns in addition to identifying diabetogenic chemicals, and offers thus promising guidance for future research in regard to the etiology and pathogenesis of complex diseases.",,"article; biological model; chemically induced disorder; computer simulation; environmental exposure; gene regulatory network; genetic association; genetics; human; meta analysis; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; systems biology; Computer Simulation; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Environmental Exposure; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Models, Biological; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Signal Transduction; Systems Biology",
Illicit drugs and the environment - A review,"Pal R., Megharaj M., Kirkbride K.P., Naidu R.",2013,Science of the Total Environment,"Illicit drugs and their metabolites are the latest group of emerging pollutants. Determination of their concentration in environment (such as water bodies, soil, sediment, air) is an indirect tool to estimate the community level consumption of illicit drug and to evaluate potential ecotoxicological impacts from chronic low level exposure. They enter the wastewater network as unaltered drugs and/or their active metabolites by human excretion after illegal consumption or by accidental or deliberate disposal from clandestine drug laboratories. This article critically reviews the occurrence and concentration levels of illicit drugs and their metabolites in different environmental compartments (e.g., wastewater, surface waters, groundwater, drinking water, and ambient air) and their potential impact on the ecosystem. There is limited published information available on the presence of illicit drugs in the environment, reports are available mainly from European countries, UK, USA, and Canada but there is a lack of information from the remainder of the world. Although the environmental concentrations are not very high, they can potentially impact the human health and ecosystem functioning. Cocaine, morphine, amphetamine, and MDMA have potent pharmacological activities and their presence as complex mixtures in water may cause adverse effect on aquatic organisms and human health. However, there is no current regulation demanding the determination of occurrence of these emerging pollutants in treated wastewater, surface water, drinking water, or atmosphere. Thus, critical investigation on distribution pattern of this new group of emerging contaminant and their potential harmful impact on our environment needs immediate attention. © 2012 .",Ecotoxicity; Emerging contaminant; Groundwater; Illicit drug; Surface water; Wastewater,"Distribution patterns; Ecosystem functioning; Ecotoxicity; Emerging contaminant; Environmental compartment; Environmental concentration; Illicit drug; Pharmacological activity; Biomolecules; Complex networks; Ecosystems; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Metabolites; Pollution; Surface waters; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Wastewater disposal; 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine; amphetamine; benzoylecgonine; cannabinoid; cocaine; drinking water; dronabinol; ecgonine methyl ester; ground water; homococaine; illicit drug; methamphetamine; morphine; norcocaine; opiate; surface water; ambient air; concentration (composition); drinking water; drug; ecosystem response; ecotoxicology; environmental impact; groundwater; metabolite; pollutant source; surface water; wastewater; ambient air; aquatic environment; atmosphere; Canada; ecosystem; ecotoxicity; ecotoxicology; environmental exposure; environmental impact; metabolite; pollutant; prevalence; priority journal; review; United Kingdom; United States; waste water; waste water management; Canada; United Kingdom; United States; Ecotoxicity; Emerging contaminant; Groundwater; Illicit drug; Surface water; Wastewater; Air Pollutants; Ecotoxicology; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Soil Pollutants; Street Drugs; Substance-Related Disorders; Water Pollutants, Chemical",
Food traceability as an integral part of logistics management in food and agricultural supply chain,"Bosona T., Gebresenbet G.",2013,Food Control,"The contemporary food supply chain (FSC) should adequately provide information that consumers and other concerned bodies need to know such as variety of the food attributes, country of origin, animal welfare, and genetic engineering related issues. For this, effective food traceability system (FTS) is important. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive literature review on food traceability issues. About 74 studies, mainly focusing on food traceability issues and published during 2000-2013, were reviewed. Based on the review results, the definition, driving forces, barriers in developing and implementing FTSs, benefits, traceability technologies, improvements, and performances of FTSs have been identified and discussed. Considering FTS as an integral part of logistics management, new conceptual definition of FTS has been provided. This review has pointed out that the issue of developing effective and full chain FTS is quite complex in nature as it requires a deeper understanding of real processes from different perspectives such as economic, legal, technological, and social issues. Therefore, future researches (recommended here) on traceability should focus on: integration of traceability activities with food logistics activities; technological aspects of FTSs; the linkage between traceability system and food production units; standardization of data capturing and information exchange; awareness creation strategies; continuity of information flow and effective communication of traceability information to consumers and other stakeholders; the linkage between different drivers of FTS; improvement strategies of FTS; and development of performance evaluation frameworks for FTSs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Food recall; Food traceability; Food traceability information; Food traceability performance; Food traceability technology,,
Functional star polymers via living radical polymerization-designer functional nanospaces,Terashima T.,2013,Kobunshi Ronbunshu,"This comprehensive article summarizes our recent efforts to design functional star polymers via living radical polymerization as functional nanospaces for catalysis and molecular recognition. Metal-bearing star polymer catalysts are efficiently obtained from the ruthenium-mediated linking reaction of arm polymers in the presence of a ligand monomer. Star polymer catalysts (nanoreactors) were effective for oxidation of sec-alcohols, (asymmetric) hydrogenation of ketones, and living radical polymerization, performing activity, stability, functionality-tolerance, and practicability (catalyst recycle, easy product recovery) higher than conventional polymer catalysts and analogues of in-core metal complexes. Core-functionalized star polymer nanocapsules selectively capture and stimuli-responsively release functional molecules. The key is to condense functional groups such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), perfluoroalkane, and quaternary ammonium groups into the cores. Single-chain star polymers are created as a new class of star polymers via the self-folding of amphiphilic random copolymers with intramolecular hydrophobic interaction in water.",Amphiphilic copolymer; Hydrogenation; Living radical polymerization; Microgel; Molecular recognition; Oxidation; Polymer catalyst; Reaction space; Ruthenium; Star polymer,Amphiphilic co-polymers; Living radical polymerization; Microgel; Polymer catalysts; Reaction spaces; Star polymers; Catalysts; Copolymers; Functional groups; Hydrogenation; Ketones; Metal complexes; Molecular recognition; Oxidation; Polyethylene glycols; Polymers; Ruthenium; Living polymerization,
Development of achiral and chiral 2D HPLC methods for analysis of albendazole metabolites in microsomal fractions using multivariate analysis for the in vitro metabolism,"Belaz K.R.A., Pereira-Filho E.R., Oliveira R.V.",2013,Journal of Chromatography B: Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical and Life Sciences,"In this work, the development of two multidimensional liquid chromatography methods coupled to a fluorescence detector is described for direct analysis of microsomal fractions obtained from rat livers. The chiral multidimensional method was then applied for the optimization of the in vitro metabolism of albendazole by experimental design. Albendazole was selected as a model drug because of its anthelmintics properties and recent potential for cancer treatment. The development of two fully automated achiral-chiral and chiral-chiral high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods for the determination of albendazole (ABZ) and its metabolites albendazole sulphoxide (ABZ-SO), albendazole sulphone (ABZ-SO2) and albendazole 2-aminosulphone (ABZ-SO2NH2) in microsomal fractions are described. These methods involve the use of a phenyl (RAM-phenyl-BSA) or octyl (RAM-C8-BSA) restricted access media bovine serum albumin column for the sample clean-up, followed by an achiral phenyl column (15.0×0.46cmI.D.) or a chiral amylose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) column (15.0×0.46cmI.D.).

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the safety profile of fast-track surgery for colorectal surgery,"Heiying J., Leng Q., Gong W.",2013,Central European Journal of Medicine,"Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety profile of fast-track surgery (FTS) compared to standard care in elective colorectal surgery involving segmental colonic and/or rectal resection. Methods: All of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on FTS for colorectal surgery were analyzed with the Cochrane systematic review. Database retrievals of Medline, Embase and Cochrane was were conducted, together with two published FTS meta-analyses. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the studies, extracted the relevant data and performed a cross-check. A metaanalysis was performed with RevMan 5 software. Results: A total of 15 studies were reviewed in this study, including 13 articles in English and 2 articles in Chinese, of which 7 were RCTs and 8 were CCTs. The overall rates of morbidity and readmission in the FTS group were lower compared to patients who underwent the conventional treatments (conventional treatment group or control group) in the RCTs but tended to increase in the CCTs. There were no statistically significant differences between the FTS group and the control group regarding ileus, anastomotic leakage, abdominal distention, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention and infection of the incisional wound. Conclusion: The overall rates of morbidity and readmission in the FTS group were similar or even lower compared to the control group in RCTs, with an increasing trend in the CCTs. Further discussion is needed as to why the results of the RCTs were not repeated in the CCTs, especially with regard to the causes of readmission. It should also be determined whether an early discharge might cause a delay in the diagnosis of some complications, and thereby the occurrence of serious complications. If a number of severe complications occurred due to an early discharge, the value of FTS would be in question. © 2012 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Colorectal surgery; Fast track surgery; Meta-analysis; Safety profile; Systematic review,abdominal distension; anastomosis leakage; colorectal surgery; comparative study; controlled clinical trial (topic); fast track surgery; hospital readmission; human; incidence; intestine obstruction; meta analysis; morbidity; postoperative ileus; postoperative nausea and vomiting; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; safety; surgical infection; surgical technique; systematic review; treatment outcome; urine retention,
Evaluation of the association between persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and diabetes in epidemiological studies: A national toxicology program workshop review,"Taylor K.W., Novak R.F., Anderson H.A., Birnbaum L.S., Blystone C., De Vito M., Jacobs D., Köhrle J., Lee D.-H., Rylander L., Rignell-Hydbom A., Tornero-Velez R., Turyk M.E., Boyles A.L., Thayer K.A., Lind L.",2013,Environmental Health Perspectives,"Background: Diabetes is a major threat to public health in the United States and worldwide. Understanding the role of environmental chemicals in the development or progression of diabetes is an emerging issue in environmental health. Objective: We assessed the epidemiologic literature for evidence of associations between persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and type 2 diabetes. Methods: Using a PubMed search and reference lists from relevant studies or review articles, we identified 72 epidemiological studies that investigated associations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) with diabetes. We evaluated these studies for consistency, strengths and weaknesses of study design (including power and statistical methods), clinical diagnosis, exposure assessment, study population characteristics, and identification of data gaps and areas for future research. Conclusions: Heterogeneity of the studies precluded conducting a meta-analysis, but the overall evidence is sufficient for a positive association of some organochlorine POPs with type 2 diabetes. Collectively, these data are not sufficient to establish causality. Initial data mining revealed that the strongest positive correlation of diabetes with POPs occurred with organochlorine compounds, such as trans-nonachlor, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dioxins and dioxin-like chemicals. There is less indication of an association between other nonorganochlorine POPs, such as perfluoroalkyl acids and brominated compounds, and type 2 diabetes. Experimental data are needed to confirm the causality of these POPs, which will shed new light on the pathogenesis of diabetes.

Global warming potentials and radiative efficiencies of halocarbons and related compounds: A comprehensive review,"Hodnebrog Ø., Etminan M., Fuglestvedt J.S., Marston G., Myhre G., Nielsen C.J., Shine K.P., Wallington T.J.",2013,Reviews of Geophysics,"In the mid-1970s, it was recognized that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were strong greenhouse gases that could have substantial impacts on radiative forcing of climate change, as well as being substances that deplete stratospheric ozone. Around a decade later, this group of radiatively active compounds was expanded to include a large number of replacements for ozone-depleting substances such as chlorocarbons, hydrochlorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), bromofluorocarbons, and bromochlorofluorocarbons. This paper systematically reviews the published literature concerning the radiative efficiencies (REs) of CFCs, bromofluorocarbons and bromochlorofluorocarbons (halons), HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs, sulfur hexafluoride, nitrogen trifluoride, and related halogen containing compounds. In addition, we provide a comprehensive and self-consistent set of new calculations of REs and global warming potentials (GWPs) for these compounds, mostly employing atmospheric lifetimes taken from the available literature. We also present global temperature change potentials for selected gases. Infrared absorption spectra used in the RE calculations were taken from databases and individual studies and from experimental and ab initio computational studies. Evaluations of REs and GWPs are presented for more than 200 compounds. Our calculations yield REs significantly (> 5%) different from those in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for 49 compounds. We present new RE values for more than 100 gases which were not included in AR4. A widely used simple method to calculate REs and GWPs from absorption spectra and atmospheric lifetimes is assessed and updated. This is the most comprehensive review of the radiative efficiencies and global warming potentials of halogenated compounds performed to date. Key Points We review REs of CFCs,Bromocarbons and halons, HCFCs,HFCs,PFCs, SF6,NF3. We present calculations of REs and GWPs for these compounds.

Antirotation proximal femoral nail versus dynamic hip screw for intertrochanteric fractures: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies,"Shen L., Zhang Y., Shen Y., Cui Z.",2013,Orthopaedics and Traumatology: Surgery and Research,"Background: Previous studies comparing proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) with dynamic hip screw (DHS) for peritrochanteric fractures reported conflicting findings. The objective of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of PFNA and DHS for pertrochanteric fractures. Hypothesis: PFNA achieves better efficacy for peritrochanteric fractures compared with DHS. Materials and methods: Relevant randomized controlled trials comparing PFNA with DHS for pertrochanteric fractures were assessed for eligibility and included into this meta-analysis. Data were extracted independently and methodological quality was further assessed. The inclusion criteria of this meta-analysis were: randomized controlled trials comparing PFNA with DHS for pertrochanteric fractures and reporting at least one of these main outcomes, including operating time, blood loss, all causes mortality, and complications. Results: Five randomized controlled trials were finally included into this meta-analysis. Pooled results showed there were less blood loss (weighted mean difference Blood loss = -249.75. ml, 95%CI -303.83 to -195.67, P<0.0001) and fewer complications (Odds ratio = 0.40, 95%CI 0.23 to 0.70, P=0.001) in the PFNA group compared with the DHS group. However, there was no difference in term of mortality between those two groups (Odds ratio mortality = 1.13, 95%CI 0.47 to 2.69, P=0.79). Sensitivity analysis by sequential omission of individual studies showed that the significance of pooled odds ratios was robust, which suggested this outcome was credible. Discussion: PFNA can benefit peritrochanteric fractures patients with less blood loss and fewer complications compared with DHS. The significant heterogeneity among the included trials for intraoperative blood loss, and operation time may be attributable to variation in the skills of the surgeons and the different types of perirochanteric fractures.

Synthesis of carbon nanofibers supported cobalt catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch process,"Díaz J.A., Martínez-Fernández M., Romero A., Valverde J.L.",2013,Fuel,"In this paper, CNFs prepared at three different temperatures (1023, 873 and 723 K, called CNF-1, CNF-2 and CNF-3, respectively) were used as supports for cobalt-based catalysts in the Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS). The supports and cobalt catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques; the metal content of the cobalt-based catalysts was analyzed by atomic absorption. The activity and selectivity of the CNFs supported catalysts were studied at 523 K, 20 bar and H2/CO = 2. Co/CNF-1 and Co/CNF-2 were very active and showed high selectivity to CH4 and CO2, without further deactivation, whereas the less active catalyst Co/CNF-3 led to the highest selectivity to long-chained hydrocarbons (C5+) and under was a remarkable deactivation. Used catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption- desorption, XRD and TGA. Results confirmed that all the catalysts underwent catalyst fouling as a consequence of C5+ hydrocarbons formation whereas catalyst Co/CNF-3 presented a notably metal sintering by coalescence. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

High Fat Diet Feeding Exaggerates Perfluorooctanoic Acid-Induced Liver Injury in Mice via Modulating Multiple Metabolic Pathways,"Tan X., Xie G., Sun X., Li Q., Zhong W., Qiao P., Sun X., Jia W., Zhou Z.",2013,PLoS ONE,"High fat diet (HFD) is closely linked to a variety of health issues including fatty liver. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a synthetic perfluorinated carboxylic acid, also causes liver injury. The present study investigated the possible interactions between high fat diet and PFOA in induction of liver injury. Mice were pair-fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or low fat control with or without PFOA administration at 5 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks. Exposure to PFOA alone caused elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and increased liver weight along with reduced body weight and adipose tissue mass. HFD alone did not cause liver damage, but exaggerated PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity as indicated by higher plasma ALT and AST levels, and more severe pathological changes including hepatocyte hypertrophy, lipid droplet accumulation and necrosis as well as inflammatory cell infiltration. These additive effects of HFD on PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity correlated with metabolic disturbance in liver and blood as well as up-regulation of hepatic proinflammatory cytokine genes. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that both serum and hepatic metabolite profiles of PFOA, HFD, or HFD-PFOA group were clearly differentiated from that of controls. PFOA affected more hepatic metabolites than HFD, but HFD showed positive interaction with PFOA on fatty acid metabolites including long chain fatty acids and acylcarnitines. Taken together, dietary high fat potentiates PFOA-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and necrotic cell death by disturbing hepatic metabolism and inducing inflammation. This study demonstrated, for the first time, that HFD increases the risk of PFOA in induction of hepatotoxicity. © 2013 Tan et al.",,"acylcarnitine; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; CXCL1 chemokine; fat droplet; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; interleukin 1beta; long chain fatty acid; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; macrophage inflammatory protein 2; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; perfluorooctanoic acid; RANTES; tumor necrosis factor alpha; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; fatty acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; triacylglycerol; adipose tissue; alanine aminotransferase blood level; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; cell infiltration; controlled study; drug metabolism; fatty acid metabolism; gene expression; glucose metabolism; hepatitis; lipid diet; lipid storage; liver disease; liver hypertrophy; liver metabolism; liver necrosis; liver toxicity; liver weight; male; metabolic disorder; metabolomics; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; upregulation; weight reduction; animal; blood; body weight; C57BL mouse; chemically induced; complication; drug effects; fatty liver; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; inflammation; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; liver; liver cell; metabolism; necrosis; organ size; pathology; toxicity; white adipose tissue; Mus; Adipose Tissue, White; Alanine Transaminase; Animals; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Body Weight; Caprylates; Diet, High-Fat; Fatty Acids; Fatty Liver; Fluorocarbons; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Hepatocytes; Inflammation; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Necrosis; Organ Size; Triglycerides",
Biocatalytic membrane reactors for the removal of recalcitrant and emerging pollutants from wastewater,"Hai F.I., Nghiem L.D., Modin O.",2013,Handbook of Membrane Reactors,"The potential fields of application of biocatalytic membrane reactors have widened considerably in recent years. Although biocatalytic membrane reactors, in general, are yet to achieve broad industrial application, in the not too far future they are expected to play a major role, not only for the production, transformation and valorization of raw materials but also for environmental remediations. This chapter comprehensively reviews the laboratory scale studies which demonstrate the potential of biocatalytic membrane reactors in wastewater treatment applications. Studies reported in the literature, however, serve as proof of concept only. Issues that need to be addressed in order to achieve scale-up of such systems have been discussed in this chapter. © Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2013.

Environmental influences on the development of endometriosis,"Carmona F., Martínez-Zamora A., Bassols M.L., Balasch J.",2013,Journal of Endometriosis and Pelvic Pain Disorders,"Purpose: Several environmental toxicants (ETs), including dioxins and dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), perfluorochemicals, organochlorine pesticides, phthalates, and heavy metals (especially cadmium with its estrogen-like properties in animal models) have been investigated as possibly being related to endometriosis. Methods: Systematic review of pertinent literature. Results: DLCs have been the most investigated ETs. DLCs are persistent organic pollutants with highly toxic potential and include three types of compounds: polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) or furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The most toxic is 2, 3, 7, 8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The connection mechanism between dioxins and endometriosis is still unclear. However, dioxins and DLCs are endocrine-disrupting compounds that can affect the pathobiology of endometriosis at multiple levels. Part of the dioxin and DLCs toxic effects can be accounted for by their interaction with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). It has been proposed that dioxin can initiate or promote endometriosis by means of interaction with estrogen receptors or by suppressing the expression of progesterone receptors. Furthermore, TCDD alters the expression of cytokines and growth factors, remodeling enzymes and cytochrome P450 expression and activity. Conclusions: Studies in rhesus models have revealed a correlation between dioxin exposure and endometriosis. However, evidence from epidemiologic studies is inconclusive. © 2013 Wichtig Editore.",Dioxin; Endometriosis; Environment; Risk factor,"2, 3, 7, 8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; cadmium; chemokine receptor CCR8; chemokine receptor CXCR1; cytochrome P450; cytochrome P450 1A1; cytochrome P450 2E1; dioxin; estrogen receptor; gamma synuclein; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; glutathione transferase; growth factor; hypoxia inducible factor 1beta; interleukin 8; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; messenger RNA; organochlorine pesticide; perfluoro compound; phthalic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; progesterone receptor; prostaglandin E2; RANTES; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; disease severity; endometriosis; environmental exposure; environmental factor; human; incidence; lipid blood level; nonhuman; pollution; prevalence; protein expression; review; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; systematic review; toxicity",
Fluorinated ionic liquids: Properties and applications,"Pereiro A.B., Araújo J.M.M., Martinho S., Alves F., Nunes S., Matias A., Duarte C.M.M., Rebelo L.P.N., Marrucho I.M.",2013,ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,"Ionic liquids have become a green media for engineering applications due to exceptional physicochemical properties, such as their practically nonvolatile nature, null flammability, low melting point, high ionic conductivity, and thermal and electrochemical stability. This work aimed to select the best fluorinated ionic liquids for the following applications: recovery/recycling of perfluorocarbon contaminants such as greenhouse perfluorocarbons gases and perfluoroalkyl acids of industrial effluents that are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic, and the partial or total replacement of inert perfluorocarbons in oxygen therapeutic emulsions by enhancing the emulsion stability and increasing the solubility of respiratory gas. With this dual goal in mind, thermodynamic and thermophysical properties of fluorinated ionic liquids (FILs) and their toxicity and biocompatibility are discussed so that the feasibility of the proposed applications can be evaluated. Herein, FILs are defined as ionic liquids with fluorinated chain lengths equal or greater than four carbon atoms. This paper provides a critical review of the experimental data for fluorinated ionic liquids available in the literature, and subsequently, with the aim of expanding knowledge of FILs, eight new fluorinated ionic liquids were selected for characterization. The attained results will clearly impact applications using polyfluorinated compounds. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",Cytotoxicity; Environmental protection; Fluorinated ionic liquids; Greenhouse gases; PFCs; Physical and thermal properties,Electrochemical stabilities; Emulsion stability; Engineering applications; Experimental datum; Industrial effluent; Perfluoroalkyl acids; PFCs; Physicochemical property; Biocompatibility; Cytotoxicity; Emulsification; Environmental protection; Greenhouse gases; Inert gases; Sewage; Thermodynamic properties; Ionic liquids,
Hydrodynamic effect of oxygenated byproduct during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in slurry bubble column,"Yang J.H., Hur Y.G., Chun D.H., Kim H.-J., Lee H.-T., Jung H., Park S.B.",2013,Chemical Engineering and Processing: Process Intensification,"The Fischer-Tropsch reaction was performed using a pilot-scale slurry bubble column reactor (SBCR) and a lab-scale continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). In contrast to the CSTR, a transitory induction period was observed in the SBCR. In this study, we investigated the catalyst performance during the induction period focusing on the hydrodynamic parameter changes inside the reactor. We measured the hydraulic pressure for the constant slurry thickness during FTS reaction. The FT wax product was regularly withdrawn using a metal filter and analyzed for density, oxygen concentration, and compositional analysis. The liquid density was affected by the dilution of the initial liquid media by fresh FT product for the whole reaction time of 180. h. On the other hand, the oxygen concentration increased sharply for the initial 85. h and then reached the steady state. Accordingly, the gas hold-up and CO conversion were enhanced for the same period. The increase in the gas hold-up could be explained by the coalescence inhibition effect of oxygenated compounds, which were the main byproducts when iron-based catalysts were used. The dynamic gas disengagement technique was employed to identify the coalescence inhibition effect of alcohol in the hydrocarbon system using a cylindrical acrylic bubble column. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Coalescence; Fischer-Tropsch reaction; Gas hold-up; Iron based catalyst; Oxygenate byproduct; Slurry bubble column,Continuous stirred tank reactor; Disengagement techniques; Fischer-Tropsch reaction; Gas hold up; Hydrodynamic parameters; Iron-based catalyst; Slurry bubble column; Slurry bubble column reactors; Byproducts; Catalysts; Coalescence; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Fluid dynamics; Iron compounds; Oxygen; Bubble columns,
"Prenatal environmental factors influencing IgE levels, atopy and early asthma","Peters J.L., Boynton-Jarrett R., Sandel M.",2013,Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology,"Purpose of Review: There is increasing evidence that the prenatal window represents a critical period in which the developing immune system may be primed toward an allergic phenotype. Studies have investigated the role of a number of maternal environmental exposures on subsequent allergic disorders in the offspring. We summarize findings from recent studies on prenatal environmental factors influencing IgE levels, atopy, and early asthma. Recent Findings: A building literature supports the influence of maternal exposure to environmental pollutants, such as allergens, traffic-related air pollution, tobacco smoke, and organochlorine compounds and social factors on allergic outcomes. More novel associations have been investigated, such as the effect of prenatal exposures to phthalates, bisphenol A, and magnetic fields. There is also rising interest in epigenetics as a pathway of action by which maternal exposure affect immune health. Summary: Emerging research highlights the challenges of investigating in-utero exposures and of relating exposures to such a heterogeneous and complex outcome as allergic disease. Further research is needed on the mechanisms by which prenatal exposure influences allergic response in childhood and how postnatal, familial and social factors, and sex can modify disease outcomes. Epigenetics is a promising new frontier, and likely one of several explanatory factors.

Exploiting quorum sensing to confuse bacterial pathogens,"LaSarre B., Federle M.J.",2013,Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews,"Cell-cell communication, or quorum sensing, is a widespread phenomenon in bacteria that is used to coordinate gene expression among local populations. Its use by bacterial pathogens to regulate genes that promote invasion, defense, and spread has been particularly well documented. With the ongoing emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, there is a current need for development of alternative therapeutic strategies. An antivirulence approach by which quorum sensing is impeded has caught on as a viable means to manipulate bacterial processes, especially pathogenic traits that are harmful to human and animal health and agricultural productivity. The identification and development of chemical compounds and enzymes that facilitate quorum-sensing inhibition (QSI) by targeting signaling molecules, signal biogen-esis, or signal detection are reviewed here. Overall, the evidence suggests that QSI therapy may be efficacious against some, but not necessarily all, bacterial pathogens, and several failures and ongoing concerns that may steer future studies in productive directions are discussed. Nevertheless, various QSI successes have rightfully perpetuated excitement surrounding new potential therapies, and this review highlights promising QSI leads in disrupting pathogenesis in both plants and animals.

Gaseous phase studies of new copper(II) carboxylate complexes with tert-butylamine as potential precursors for chemical vapor deposition (CVD),Szymańska I.B.,2013,Polyhedron,"Copper(II) carboxylate compounds with tert-butylamine of the general formula [Cu2(tBuNH2)2(μ-O 2CR)4], where R = CnF2 n+1, n = 1-6, were synthesized in the reaction of copper(II) perfluorinated carboxylates with tert-butylamine generated in situ from tert-butyl isocyanate. The obtained complexes were characterized in the solid state and in the gaseous phase by electron impact mass spectrometry (EI MS), IR spectroscopy, and thermal analysis with the detection of evolved gases. In addition, during the recrystallization of the [Cu2( tBuNH2)2(μ-O2CC3F 7)4] complex the (tBuNH3) +(C3F7CO2)- ion pair was isolated, and its X-ray structure was determined. As a result of a mass spectra analysis, the presence of metallated species in the gaseous phase was revealed. Among the species detected, the pseudomolecular ions [Cu2( tBuNH2)2(μ-O2CR) 3]+ were found. The fact confirmed the dimeric structure of the studied complexes with bridging carboxylates and axially N-coordinated amines. TGA studies demonstrated that copper transfer to the gaseous phase occurs at atmospheric pressure, which suggests that the obtained compounds can be promising precursors for chemical vapor deposition. The selected Cu(II) compounds were used in the preliminary CVD experiments, and the conformal copper layers were formed with no additional reducing agents. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental contaminant exposures and preterm birth: A comprehensive review,"Ferguson K.K., O'Neill M.S., Meeker J.D.",2013,Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health - Part B: Critical Reviews,"Preterm birth is a significant public health concern, as it is associated with high risk of infant mortality, various morbidities in both the neonatal period and later in life, and a significant societal economic burden. As many cases are of unknown etiology, identification of the contribution of environmental contaminant exposures is a priority in the study of preterm birth. This is a comprehensive review of all known studies published from 1992 through August 2012 linking maternal exposure to environmental chemicals during pregnancy with preterm birth. Using PubMed searches, studies were identified that examined associations between preterm birth and exposure to five categories of environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants, drinking-water contaminants, atmospheric pollutants, metals and metalloids, and other environmental contaminants. Individual studies were summarized and specific suggestions were made for future work in regard to exposure and outcome assessment methods as well as study design, with the recommendation of focusing on potential mediating toxicological mechanisms. In conclusion, no consistent evidence was found for positive associations between individual chemical exposures and preterm birth. By identifying limitations and addressing the gaps that may have impeded the ability to identify true associations thus far, this review can guide future epidemiologic studies of environmental exposures and preterm birth. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; arsenic; cadmium; dioxin; environmental chemical; lead; mercury; organochlorine pesticide; perfluoro compound; phthalic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; environmental exposure; gestational age; human; outcome assessment; pollutant; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; review; systematic review; Air Pollutants; Dioxins; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Metals; Pesticides; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Water Pollutants, Chemical",
Toxicological function of adipose tissue: Focus on persistent organic pollutants,"La Merrill M., Emond C., Kim M.J., Antignac J.-P., Le Bizec B., Clément K., Birnbaum L.S., Barouki R.",2013,Environmental Health Perspectives,"Background: A dipose tissue (AT) is involved in several physiological functions, including metabolic regulation, energy storage, and endocrine functions. Objectives: In this review we examined the evidence that an additional function of AT is to modulate persistent organic pollutant (POP) toxicity through several mechanisms. Methods: We reviewed the literature on the interaction of AT with POPs to provide a comprehensive model for this additional function of AT. discussion: As a storage compartment for lipophilic POPs, AT plays a critical role in the toxico-kinetics of a variety of drugs and pollutants, in particular, POPs. By sequestering POPs, AT can protect other organs and tissues from POPs overload. However, this protective function could prove to be a threat in the long run. Te accumulation of lipophilic POPs will increase total body burden. These accumulated POPs are slowly released into the bloodstream, and more so during weight loss. Thus, AT constitutes a continual source of internal exposure to POPs. In addition to its buffering function, AT is also a target of POPs and may mediate part of their metabolic effects. This is particularly relevant because many POPs induce obesogenic effects that may lead to quantitative and qualitative alterations of AT. Some POPs also induce a proinflammatory state in AT, which may lead to detrimental metabolic effects.

"Direct quantitative analysis of benzodiazepines, metabolites, and analogs in diluted human urine by Rapid resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry","Hsu R.-Y., Chan S.-A., Lin S.-L., Lin T.-Y., Chu W.-L., Fuh M.-R.",2013,Journal of Food and Drug Analysis,"Rapid resolution liquid chromatography (RRLC) coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (QqQ-MS) was developed for direct quantitative analysis of benzodiazepines (BDZs) and their metabolites, as well as BDZ analogs (zopiclone, zolpidem, and zaleplon) in diluted human urine. A perfluorophenyl column packed with sub-2-mm particles and a C8 precolumn were applied to accomplish RRLC analysis with symmetric peak shapes. Urine samples were diluted 10-fold with Milli-Q water prior to autoinjection for direct quantification of 34 target analytes with negligible matrix effect. Gradient elution and dynamic multiple reaction monitoring were used for simultaneous quantitation of 34 BDZs, metabolites, and BDZ analogs. Good recovery was obtained in the range of 80.2-98.5% and the limit of detection ranged from 0.01 ng/mL to 0.5 ng/mL for all 34 target analytes in spiked urine. Moreover, good precision and accuracy were obtained for quantitative determination in diluted urine samples by the proposed RRLC/QqQ-MS method for intra-day/inter-day assays in the ranges of 0.1-8.8%/0.1-8.9% and 91.2-106.1%/89.6-104.6%, respectively. The applicability of this newly developed RRLC/QqQ-MS method was demonstrated by quantitative determination of BDZs, metabolites, and BDZ analogs in various clinical urine samples. © 2013, Food and Drug Administration, Taiwan.

The impact of PFOS on health in the general population: A review,"Saikat S., Kreis I., Davies B., Bridgman S., Kamanyire R.",2013,Environmental Sciences: Processes and Impacts,"Perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) is a persistent organic pollutant that is toxic, bioaccumulative and undergoes wide transportation across all environmental media. It has been widely detected in environmental samples but there is limited information about the health effects on humans from environmental exposure. This paper presents the findings of a review of the literature on the impact of PFOS on the health of the general population. Fifteen relevant epidemiological studies were identified that looked at the association between human PFOS exposure and a range of health related outcomes. Small but statistically significant associations have been reported with PFOS and total cholesterol, glucose metabolism, body mass index (BMI), thyroid function, infertility, breast feeding, uric acid and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The true significance of these findings is uncertain due to the inconsistencies in some of the study results and the limitations of the literature. The majority of studies were cross-sectional and considered surrogate markers of health (e.g. cholesterol levels). The available literature is also limited in ascertaining the link between PFOS concentrations in the environment, exposure pathways and health effects. We conclude that the current evidence is inconclusive and further large-scale prospective cohort studies would be useful to assess the association between environmental exposure to PFOS, appropriate biomarkers (e.g. serum levels of PFOS) and health outcomes. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,cholesterol; glucose; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; testosterone; thyroglobulin; thyroid hormone; triacylglycerol; uric acid; alkanesulfonic acid; biological marker; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; pollutant; attention deficit disorder; bladder cancer; blood level; blood sampling; body mass; breast feeding; cancer incidence; cholesterol blood level; cross-sectional study; disease association; environmental exposure; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; gestational age; glucose metabolism; high risk population; human; insulin resistance; liver cancer; Medline; metabolic syndrome X; pancreas cancer; population research; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; prostate cancer; review; self report; smoking; systematic review; thyroid function; thyroid hormone blood level; waist circumference; metabolism; pollutant; statistics and numerical data; toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Biological Markers; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons,Royal Society of Chemistry

Study eligibility criteria were defined to select the articles. Results: This review of 41 studies finds limited evidence for prenatal exposure to DDE, PCBs and dioxins and risk of respiratory infections. Evidence was limited also for postnatal exposure to PCBs, specifically ndl-PCBs, and reduced immune response after vaccination in childhood. The review indicates lack of association between postnatal exposure to PCBs/ndl-PCBs and risk of asthma-related symptoms. For the other exposure-outcome associations reviewed evidence was inadequate. Discussion and conclusion: Current epidemiological evidence suggests that early-life exposure to POPs can adversely influence immune and respiratory systems development. Heterogeneity between studies in exposure and outcome assessment and the small number of studies for any given exposure-outcome relationship currently make comparisons difficult and meta-analyses impossible. Also, mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Recommendations for significantly improving our understanding thus include harmonization of exposure and outcome assessment between studies, conduct of larger studies, long-term assessment of respiratory infections and asthma symptoms in order to identify critical periods of susceptibility, integration of the potential immunotoxic mechanisms of POPs, and use of new statistical tools to detangle the role of multiple exposures on multiple outcomes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Allergy manifestations; Children; Cytokines; Immunology; Persistent organic pollutants; Respiratory tract infections,"Allergies; Diseases; Immunology; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Respiratory system; Statistical mechanics; Adverse effect; Children; Critical periods; Cytokines; Immune function; Immune response; Immune systems; Medline; Meta analysis; Multiple exposure; Outcome assessment; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Persistent organic pollutants; Postnatal exposure; Prenatal exposure; Respiratory tract infections; Statistical tools; Systematic Review; Organic pollutants; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; dioxin; furan derivative; hexachlorobenzene; perfluoro compound; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; allergy; child health; DDE; environmental risk; health risk; immune system; organic pollutant; PCB; persistence; pollution exposure; respiratory disease; allergic asthma; atopy; cellular immunity; human; humoral immunity; immunopathology; infection risk; outcome assessment; perinatal period; prenatal exposure; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; respiratory tract infection; review; systematic review; vaccination",Elsevier Ltd
"Sequencing from dried blood spots in infants with ""false positive"" newborn screen for MCAD deficiency","McCandless S.E., Chandrasekar R., Linard S., Kikano S., Rice L.",2013,Molecular Genetics and Metabolism,"Background: Newborn screening (NBS) for medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD), one of the most common disorders identified, uses measurement of octanoylcarnitine (C8) from dried blood spots. In the state of Ohio, as in many places, primary care providers, with or without consultation from a metabolic specialist, may perform ""confirmatory testing"", with the final diagnostic decision returned to the state. Confirmatory testing may involve measurement of metabolites, enzyme analysis, mutation screening, or sequencing. We now report sequencing results for infants said to have ""false positive"" NBS results for MCAD deficiency, or who died before confirmatory testing could be performed. Methods: Dried blood spots (DBS) were obtained from all 18 available NBS cards identified as ""false positive"" by NBS for the 3. year period after screening began in Ohio in 2003 (N=20, thus 2 had no DBS available), and from all 6 infants with abnormal screens who died before confirmatory testing could be obtained. DNA extracted from DBS was screened for the common c.985A. >G mutation in exon 11 of the ACADM gene, using a specific restriction digest method, followed by sequencing of the 12 exons, intron-exon junctions, and several hundred base pairs of the 5' untranslated region. Results: The NBS cut-off value for C8 used was 0.7. μmol/L. Sequencing of ACADM in six neonates with elevated C8 on NBS who died before confirmatory testing was obtained did not identify any significant variants in the coding region of the gene, suggesting that MCADD was not a contributing factor in these deaths. The mean C8 for the 18 surviving infants labeled as ""False Positives"" was 0.90 (95%CI 0.77-1.15), much lower than the mean value for confirmed cases. Ten of the 18 were premature births weighing <1200. g, the rest were normal sized and full term. Eight infants, mostly full term with appropriate birth weight, were heterozygous for the common c.985A. >G mutation; one of those also has a novel sequence change identified in exon 9 that predicts a PRO to LEU change at residue 258 of the protein. Both the phase and any possible clinical significance of the variant are unknown, but several lines of evidence suggest that it could lead to protein malfunction. That child had an NBS C8 of 2.2, more than double the mean for the False Positive group. Unfortunately, the study design did not provide clinical outcome data, but the child is not known to have presented clinically by age 7. years. Conclusions: These results suggest that sequencing of ACADM from dried blood spots can be one useful follow-up tool to provide accurate genetic counseling in the situation of an infant with elevated C8 on NBS who dies before confirmatory testing is obtained. Of surviving neonates, there appear to be two populations of infants with false positive NBS C8 values: 1) term AGA infants who are heterozygous for the common c.985A. >G mutation, and, 2) premature infants, regardless of carrier status. The finding of two sequence variants in an infant reported to the state as not affected suggests the possibility that some infants with two mutations may be reported as normal at follow-up. State registries may wish to consider asking that metabolic specialists, who are most familiar with the variability of these rare disorders, be involved in the final diagnostic evaluation. Finally, providers may wish to consider ACADM sequencing, or other diagnostic testing, as part of the confirmatory evaluation for infants with NBS C8 concentrations that are significantly above the cut-off value, even if plasma and urine metabolites are not strikingly increased. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Dried blood spots; Fatty acid oxidation disorders; Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency; Newborn screening,"medium chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; 5' untranslated region; article; base pairing; clinical article; DNA extraction; DNA screening; dried blood spot testing; exon; false positive result; gene mutation; gene sequence; human; infant; intron; male; medium chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency; newborn; newborn screening; nucleotide sequence; prematurity; priority journal; United States; Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase; False Positive Reactions; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Lipid Metabolism, Inborn Errors; Neonatal Screening",
Analytical assessment of C2-C8 alcohols as spark-ignition engine fuels,"Wallner T., Ickes A., Lawyer K.",2013,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,"The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) requires a drastic increases in production of advanced biofuels up to 36 billion gallons over the next decade while corn-based ethanol will be capped at 15 billion gallons. Currently ethanol is the predominant alternative fuel and is widely distributed at 10 vol % blends in gasoline (E10). However, certain properties of ethanol make it less desirable as a blending agent in particular at higher blend levels. Therefore the engine- and vehicle-related properties of longer chain alcohols are evaluated in comparison to gasoline to determine their suitability as blending agents for spark-ignition engine fuels. This analytical study aims at providing comprehensive property data for a range of alcohol isomers with a carbon count up to C8. Relevant physical property data is used to determine the general suitability of longer chain alcohol isomers as blending agents based on factors such as melting point and boiling. Based on initial findings the scope of the study was narrowed down to alcohols in the C2-C6 range. It was determined that the engine- and combustion-relevant information is missing from the literature for a wide range of longer chain isomers. Thus fuel testing for engine-relevant properties such as lower heating value, knock resistance (RON, MON) and Reid Vapour Pressure (RVP) for alcohols up to C6 was performed as part of this study. Data suggests that the melting point of alcohols increases with increasing carbon count and all C7 and C8 isomers exhibit melting points in excess of -40°C making their use as vehicle fuel questionable. Boiling points increase with increasing carbon count and n-structures generally have slightly higher boiling points than their respective iso-structures. Latent heat of vaporization decreases with carbon count, the mass-specific value for ethanol is triple that of gasoline, the energy specific ratio increases to a factor of 5. Alcohol fuels generally have a significantly lower RVP than gasoline, RVP decreases with increasing carbon count. Stoichiometric air demand and fuel energy content increase with carbon count. Knock resistance expressed as Research Octane Number (RON) and Motor Octane Number (MON) decreases significantly with increasing carbon count, iso-structures show increased knock resistance compared to their respective n-structures. This study is limited to analytical results as well as fuel property testing according to ASTM standards. Only properties of neat alcohols are evaluated in comparison to gasoline certification fuel, gasoline blend stock for ethanol blending and E10. The analysis of the reported properties is further focused on spark-ignition engine applications only. Future phases of this project will include the assessment of properties of multi-component blends as well as efficiency, performance and emissions testing on a modern direct-injection engine. While data for a limited number of commonly used alcohols such as ethanol and iso-butanol is available in the literature, little or no data is available for a majority of other alcohols and their isomers. In addition, engine-related data published in the past occasionally disregards the significant differences between alcohol isomers of the same chain length. This study offers a comprehensive review of physical properties of alcohols and their common isomers in the C2-C8 range as they relate to in-vehicle use and spark-ignition combustion engine application. Data presented in this paper suggests that higher alcohols have certain physical properties that might be desirable for blending with gasoline. Due to their oxygen content all alcohols have an inherent disadvantage in terms of energy content compared to non-oxygenated fuels. While this disadvantage becomes less pronounced with increasing carbon count, other less desirable properties such as a low RVP and reduced knock resistance become more dominant with longer chain length alcohols. In addition to merely evaluating properties, the selection of promising alcohols and blend levels will ultimately depend on the introduction scenario and target properties. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",Alcohol fuels; Combustion; Knock resistance; MON; Physical properties; RON; RVP; Spark-ignition engine,A-carbon; Air demand; Analytical results; ASTM Standards; Chain alcohol; Combustion engines; Comprehensive properties; Corn-based ethanol; Energy content; Fuel energy; Fuel properties; Fuel testing; Gasoline blends; Higher alcohols; In-vehicle; Introduction scenarios; Knock resistance; Latent heat of vaporization; Lower heating value; MON; Multicomponent blends; Oxygen content; Performance and emissions; Renewable fuels; Research octane number; RON; RVP; Vapour pressures; Alcohol fuels; Alternative fuels; Blending; Boiling point; Carbon; Chain length; Combustion; Combustion knock; Electric sparks; Engines; Ethanol; Gasoline; Internal combustion engines; Isomers; Melting point; Physical properties; Standards; Vapors; Vehicles; Structural properties,
Propionic acid production in a plant fibrous-bed bioreactor with immobilized Propionibacterium freudenreichii CCTCC M207015,"Chen F., Feng X., Xu H., Zhang D., Ouyang P.",2012,Journal of Biotechnology,"A plant fibrous-bed bioreactor (PFB) was constructed for propionic acid production. Sugar cane bagasse was applied to the PFB as immobilizing material. Starting at a concentration of 80. g/L of glucose, Propionibacterium freudenreichii CCTCC M207015 produced 41.20 ± 2.03. g/L of propionic acid at 108. h in the PFB. The value was 21.07% higher than that produced by free cell fermentation. Intermittent and constant fed-batch fermentations were performed in the PFB to optimize the fermentation results. The highest propionic acid concentration obtained from constant fed-batch fermentation was 136.23 ± 6.77. g/L, which is 1.40 times higher than the highest concentration (97.00. g/L) previously reported. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that cells exhibited striking changes in morphology after PFB domestication. Compared with free cell fermentation, the fluxes of propionic acid synthesis and the pentose phosphate pathway in PFB fermentation increased by 84.65% and 227.62%, respectively. On the other hand, a decrease in succinic and acetic acid fluxes was also observed. The metabolic flux distributions of the two PFB fed-batch fermentation strategies also demonstrated that constant fed-batch fermentation is a more beneficial method for the immobilized production of propionic acid. The relevant key enzyme activities and metabolic flux variations of the batch cultures showed good consistency. These results suggest that the PFB was effective in high-concentration propionic acid production. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.",Cell physiological change; Metabolic flux analysis; Plant fibrous-bed bioreactor; Propionibacterium freudenreichii CCTCC M207015; Propionic acid; Sugar cane bagasse,"Fed-batch fermentation; Metabolic flux; Metabolic flux analysis; Metabolic flux distribution; Pentose phosphate pathway; Propionibacterium freudenreichii; Scanning electrons; Sugar-cane bagasse; Batch cell culture; Bioconversion; Bioreactors; Cells; Cytology; Fermentation; Metabolism; Propionic acid; Scanning electron microscopy; Saturated fatty acids; acetic acid; bagasse; glucose; propionic acid; succinic acid; article; bacterial cell; biomass; bioreactor; biosynthesis; concentration (parameters); controlled study; enzyme activity; fed batch culture; fed batch fermentation; fermentation; metabolism; nonhuman; pentose phosphate cycle; plant fibrous bed bioreactor; priority journal; Propionibacterium freudenreichii; scanning electron microscopy; sugarcane; Acetic Acid; Bioreactors; Cells, Immobilized; Cellulose; Fermentation; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Propionates; Propionibacterium; Saccharum; Succinic Acid",
1H NMR metabolomics of Eisenia fetida responses after sub-lethal exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate,"Lankadurai B.P., Simpson A.J., Simpson M.J.",2012,Environmental Chemistry,"Environmental contextPerfluoroalkyl acids are persistent environmental contaminants that are also found in soils. We use a metabolomics approach based on nuclear magnetic resonance analyses to investigate the responses of earthworms to exposure to sub-lethal levels of two perfluoroalkyl acids. The results indicate that this metabolomics approach is able to delineate the toxic mode of action of contaminants present at sub-lethal levels. AbstractMetabolomics entails the analysis of endogenous metabolites within organisms exposed to an external stressor such as an environmental contaminant. We utilised 1H NMR-based metabolomics to elucidate sub-lethal toxic mechanisms of Eisenia fetida earthworms after exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Earthworms were exposed to a range of concentrations of PFOA (6.25 to 50gcm-2) and PFOS (3.125 to 25gcm-2) by contact tests for 2 days. Earthworm tissues were extracted using a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water, and the polar fraction was analysed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. NMR-based metabolomic analysis revealed heightened E. fetida toxic responses with higher PFOA and PFOS exposure concentrations. Principal component analysis (PCA) exhibited significant separation between control and exposed earthworms along PC1 for all PFOA and PFOS exposure concentrations. Leucine, arginine, glutamate, maltose and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are potential indicators of PFOA and PFOS exposure as these metabolite concentrations fluctuated with exposure. Our data also indicate that PFOA and PFOS exposure may increase fatty acid oxidation and interrupt ATP synthesis due to a disruption in the inner mitochondrial membrane structure. NMR-based metabolomics has promise as an insightful tool for elucidating the environmental toxicology of sub-lethal contaminant exposure. © 2012 CSIRO.",contact test; fatty acid oxidation; MOA; mode of action; PFOA; PFOS,concentration (composition); earthworm; ecotoxicology; environmental stress; fatty acid; metabolism; metabolite; nuclear magnetic resonance; organic pollutant; oxidation; pollution exposure; soil fauna; Eisenia fetida,
Substrate induced thermal decomposition of perfluoro-pentacene thin films on the coinage metals,"Schmidt C., Breuer T., Wippermann S., Schmidt W.G., Witte G.",2012,Journal of Physical Chemistry C,"The thermal and chemical stability of perfluoropentacene (PFP) thin films grown by organic molecular beam deposition onto the (111)-oriented surfaces of the coinage metals copper, silver, and gold have been studied by means of temperature dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Near-Edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS). Under vacuum conditions, PFP multilayers are completely desorbed at 425 K while molecules in contact with the Au(111) surface remain intact up to 500 K. By contrast, PFP that is in contact with Cu(111) is distinctly distorted and becomes partially defluorinated already upon thermal desorption of multilayers. A pronounced defluorination of PFP also takes place on Ag(111) at temperatures around 440 K, while further heating causes a complete cracking and defluorination. Additional measurements carried out on a regularly stepped silver surface demonstrate that steps are active sites that promote defluorination already at lower temperatures. van der Waals corrected density-functional (DFT-D) calculations show that PFP, though being weakly adsorbed on all three metal surfaces, exhibits a reduced energy barrier for defluorination, in particular on copper and silver, thus reflecting their catalytic activity. The calculations reveal further that defluorinated molecules are covalently bound to the substrate, leading to a notable bending of the molecular backbone. The present study highlights the importance of also considering chemical reactions when theoretically analyzing molecule/metal interactions and indicates that fluorinated aromatic molecules, though offering interesting electronic properties, actually exhibit a limited stability in contact with some electrode surfaces like silver due to catalytic effects. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,Active site; Aromatic molecules; Au(111) surfaces; Catalytic effects; Coinage metals; Covalently bound; Cu(1 1 1); Defluorination; Density functionals; Electrode surfaces; Metal surfaces; Near edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopies; Organic molecular beam deposition; Perfluoropentacenes; Reduced energy; Silver surface; Temperature dependent; Vacuum condition; Van der waals; Chemical modification; Coinage; Copper; Decomposition; Electronic properties; Mints; Molecules; Multilayers; Photoelectrons; Silver; Thermal desorption; Van der Waals forces; X ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Film preparation,
Computational evidence that frequency trajectory theory does not oppose but emerges from age-of-acquisition theory,"Mermillod M., Bonin P., Méot A., Ferrand L., Paindavoine M.",2012,Cognitive Science,"According to the age-of-acquisition hypothesis, words acquired early in life are processed faster and more accurately than words acquired later. Connectionist models have begun to explore the influence of the age/order of acquisition of items (and also their frequency of encounter). This study attempts to reconcile two different methodological and theoretical approaches (proposed by Lambon Ralph & Ehsan, 2006 and Zevin & Seidenberg, 2002) to age-limited learning effects. The current simulations extend the findings reported by Zevin and Seidenberg (2002) that have shown that frequency trajectories (FTs) have limited and specific effects on word-reading tasks. Using the methodological framework proposed by Lambon Ralph and Ehsan (2006), which makes it possible to compare word-reading and picture-naming tasks in connectionist networks, we were able to show that FT has a considerable influence on age-limited learning effects in a picture naming task. The findings show that when the input-output mappings are arbitrary (simulating picture naming tasks), the links formed by the network become entrenched as a result of early experience and that subsequent variations in frequency of exposure of the items have only a minor impact. In contrast, when the mappings between input-output are quasi-systematic or systematic (simulating word-reading tasks), the training of new items was generalized and resulted in the suppression of age-limited learning effects. At a theoretical level, we suggest that FT, which simultaneously takes account of time and the level of exposure across time, represents a more precise and modulated measure compared with the order of introduction of the items and may lead to innovative hypotheses in the field of age-limited learning effects. © 2012 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.",Age of acquisition; Arbitrary mappings; Frequency trajectory; Quasi-systematic/systematic mappings,"age; article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; human; language development; linguistics; psychological model; reading; time; Age Factors; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Language Development; Models, Psychological; Neural Networks (Computer); Psycholinguistics; Reading; Time Factors",
Enteral feeding tubes in patients undergoing definitive chemoradiation therapy for head-and-neck cancer: A critical review,"Koyfman S.A., Adelstein D.J.",2012,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Definitive chemoradiation therapy has evolved as the preferred organ preservation strategy in the treatment of locally advanced head-and-neck cancer (LA-HNC). Dry mouth and dysphagia are among the most common and most debilitating treatment-related toxicities that frequently necessitate the placement of enteral feeding tubes (FT) in these patients to help them meet their nutritional requirements. The use of either a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube or a nasogastric tube, the choice of using a prophylactic vs a reactive approach, and the effects of FTs on weight loss, hospitalization, quality of life, and long-term functional outcomes are areas of continued controversy. Considerable variations in practice patterns exist in the United States and abroad. This critical review synthesizes the current data for the use of enteral FTs in this patient population and clarifies the relative advantages of different types of FTs and the timing of their use. Recent developments in the biologic understanding and treatment approaches for LA-HNC appear to be favorably impacting the frequency and severity of treatment-related dysphagia and may reduce the need for enteral tube feeding in the future. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,"Chemoradiation; Critical review; Current data; Dry mouth; Enteral feeding; Head-and-neck cancer; Organ preservation; Patient population; Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy; Quality of life; Weight loss; Chemoradiotherapy; Diseases; Feeding; Population statistics; Tubes (components); cetuximab; cisplatin; fluorouracil; abscess; advanced cancer; cancer patient; chemoradiotherapy; disease severity; dysphagia; enteral feeding tube; enteric feeding; feeding apparatus; fistula; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; head and neck cancer; health care cost; hospitalization; human; intestine perforation; morbidity; nasogastric tube; priority journal; quality of life; review; risk factor; sepsis; stomach tube; treatment duration; weight reduction; Chemoradiotherapy; Costs and Cost Analysis; Deglutition Disorders; Enteral Nutrition; Equipment Design; Forecasting; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Hospitalization; Humans; Intubation, Gastrointestinal; Intubation, Intratracheal; Physician's Practice Patterns; Quality of Life; Risk Factors; Weight Loss",

Role of elective cesarean section in prevention of pelvic floor disorders,"Koc O., Duran B.",2012,Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology,"Purpose of Review: The article reviews the current evidence and the role of elective Cesarean section in the prevention of pelvic floor disorders (PFDs). Recent Findings: Recent studies have revealed that operative vaginal delivery is an important risk factor for PFDs. The cause of PFD is multifactorial. Pregnancy itself also increases the PFDs. Elective Cesarean section carries diminished risk for stress urinary incontinence. Pelvic floor muscle training should be offered to all women in their first pregnancy as a preventive strategy.

Time-trends of metals and organic contaminants in sewage sludge,"Olofsson U., Bignert A., Haglund P.",2012,Water Research,"The occurrence of chemicals in sludge from sewage treatment plants (STPs) is of concern for human health and the environment. Legislations and regulations are put in place to minimize the release of harmful chemicals into the environment and arable land, e.g. via application of sewage sludge. Temporal trends analysis of sludge contaminants can be used to assess the effectiveness of such actions. Such analyses can be performed retrospectively, using sludge stored in environmental specimen banks, to investigate new or emerging environmental contaminants. The present study provides data from time-trend analyses of metals, persistent organic pollutants, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and other organic compounds in sludge from Swedish. The analysis showed that sludge is a suitable matrix for time-trend studies and it can take on average 12 years (range, 5-26 years) to track an annual change of ±10% (with a power of 80%). Statistically significant trends were found for 18 out of the 77 compounds subjected to analysis, of which 75% showed decreasing trends. Triclosan and the antibiotic norfloxacin followed the same trend as the national recorded usage and decreased annually by 65% and 60%, respectively. The opposite was true for the methylsiloxanes, which showed an annual average increase of about 30%. A downward trend (about 20% year-1) was observed for the polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs 154 and 183), while PBDE 209 increased by 16%. Further measurements are required to determine if the substitution of PBDEs by chlorinated paraffins or organophosphorus compounds have resulted in increased concentrations of the latter in sludge. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Emerging pollutants; Organophosphorus compounds; Organotin compounds; POP; PPCP,Metal analysis; Organometallics; Phosphorus compounds; Sewage sludge; Sewage treatment plants; Emerging pollutants; Environmental contaminant; Organophosphorus compounds; Organotin compound; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Personal care products; Polybrominated diphenylethers; PPCP; Organic pollutants; dimeticone; norfloxacin; organic compound; organophosphorus compound; polybrominated diphenyl ether; triclosan; annual variation; antibiotics; concentration (composition); legal system; organic pollutant; organophosphate; persistence; sewage treatment; sludge; trend analysis; analysis; article; concentration (parameters); persistent organic pollutant; pharmaceutical and personal care product; priority journal; sewage treatment plant; sludge; water pollutant; Sweden,Elsevier Ltd
Biosynthesis of fucoxanthin and diadinoxanthin and function of initial pathway genes in Phaeodactylum tricornutum,"Dambek M., Eilers U., Breitenbach J., Steiger S., Büchel C., Sandmann G.",2012,Journal of Experimental Botany,"The biosynthesis pathway to diadinoxanthin and fucoxanthin was elucidated in Phaeodactylum tricornutum by a combined approach involving metabolite analysis identification of gene function. For the initial steps leading to β-carotene, putative genes were selected from the genomic database and the function of several of them identified by genetic pathway complementation in Escherichia coli. They included genes encoding a phytoene synthase, a phytoene desaturase, a ζ-carotene desaturase, and a lycopene β-cyclase. Intermediates of the pathway beyond β-carotene, present in trace amounts, were separated by TLC and identified as violaxanthin and neoxanthin in the enriched fraction. Neoxanthin is a branching point for the synthesis of both diadinoxanthin and fucoxanthin and the mechanisms for their formation were proposed. A single isomerization of one of the allenic double bounds in neoxanthin yields diadinoxanhin. Two reactions, hydroxylation at C8 in combination with a keto-enol tautomerization and acetylation of the 3′-HO group results in the formation of fucoxanthin. © 2012 The Author.",Carotenogenic genes; complementation; diadinoxanthin; fucoxanthin; genetic pathway; neoxanthin; Phaeodactylum tricornutum,beta carotene; carotenoid; diadinoxanthin; fucoxanthin; isomerase; lycopene cyclase isomerase; lycopene cyclase-isomerase; neoxanthin; oxidoreductase; phytoene; phytoene dehydrogenase; phytoene synthase; violaxanthin; xanthophyll; zeta carotene; zeta carotene desaturase; zeta-carotene desaturase; article; biosynthesis; chemistry; diatom; enzymology; Escherichia coli; genetic complementation; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; phylogeny; beta Carotene; Biosynthetic Pathways; Carotenoids; Diatoms; Escherichia coli; Genetic Complementation Test; Geranylgeranyl-Diphosphate Geranylgeranyltransferase; Intramolecular Lyases; Oxidoreductases; Phylogeny; Xanthophylls; zeta Carotene; Escherichia coli; Phaeodactylum tricornutum,
Diagnostic performance of stress myocardial perfusion imaging for coronary artery disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"De Jong M.C., Genders T.S.S., Van Geuns R.-J., Moelker A., Hunink M.G.M.",2012,European Radiology,"Objectives To determine and compare the diagnostic performance of stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), using conventional coronary angiography (CCA) as the reference standard. Methods We searched Medline and Embase for literature that evaluated stress MPI for the diagnosis of obstructive CAD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrastenhanced echocardiography (ECHO), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). Results All pooled analyses were based on random effects models. Articles on MRI yielded a total of 2,970 patients from 28 studies, articles on ECHO yielded a sample size of 795 from 10 studies, articles on SPECT yielded 1,323 from 13 studies. For CAD defined as either at least 50 %, at least 70 % or at least 75 % lumen diameter reduction on CCA, the natural logarithms of the diagnostic odds ratio (lnDOR) for MRI (3.63; 95 % CI 3.26-4.00) was significantly higher compared to that of SPECT (2.76; 95 % CI 2.28-3.25; P=0.006) and that of ECHO (2.83; 95 % CI 2.29-3.37; P=0.02). There was no significant difference between the lnDOR of SPECT and ECHO (P=0.52). Conclusion Our results suggest that MRI is superior for the diagnosis of obstructive CAD compared with ECHO and SPECT. ECHO and SPECT demonstrated similar diagnostic performance. Key Points ̇ MRI can assess myocardial perfusion. ̇ MR perfusion diagnoses coronary artery disease better than echocardiography or SPECT. ̇ Echocardiography and SPECT have similar diagnostic performance. ̇ MRI can save coronary artery disease patients from more invasive tests. ̇ MRI and SPECT show evidence of publication bias, implying possible overestimation. © European Society of Radiology 2012.",Coronary artery disease; Diagnostic performance; Meta-analysis; Myocardial perfusion imaging; Systematic review,"adenosine; albumin; atropine; contrast medium; dipyridamole; dobutamine; fluorocarbon; methoxy isobutyl isonitrile technetium tc 99m; perflubutane; perfluorocarbon exposed sonicated dextrose albumin; perflutren; sonovue; tetrofosmin tc 99m; thallium 201; tracer; unclassified drug; angiocardiography; contrast enhanced echocardiography; contrast enhancement; coronary artery disease; coronary artery obstruction; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; echocardiography; Embase; exercise test; human; intermethod comparison; Medline; meta analysis; model; myocardial perfusion imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; pharmacologic stress testing; positron emission tomography; priority journal; radiodiagnosis; review; single photon emission computer tomography; standard; systematic review; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Exercise Test; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Myocardial Perfusion Imaging; Prevalence; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",

Here, we present two methods based on liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for reliable measurement of water-soluble metabolites involved in phospholipid biosynthesis, as well as several other metabolites that reflect the metabolic status of the parasite including amino acids, carboxylic acids, energy-related carbohydrates, and nucleotides. A total of 35 compounds was quantified. In the first method, polar compounds were retained by hydrophilic interaction chromatography (amino column) and detected in negative mode using succinic acid- 13C 4 and fluorovaline as internal standards. In the second method, separations were carried out using reverse phase (C18) ion-pair liquid chromatography, with heptafluorobutyric acid as a volatile ion pairing reagent in positive detection mode, using d 9-choline and 4-aminobutanol as internal standards. Standard curves were performed in P. falciparum-infected and uninfected red blood cells using standard addition method (r 2&gt;0.99). The intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision as well as the extraction recovery of each compound were determined. The lower limit of quantitation varied from 50pmol to 100fmol/3×10 7cells. These methods were validated and successfully applied to determine intracellular concentrations of metabolites from uninfected host RBCs and isolated Plasmodium parasites. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry; Metabolomics; Phospholipid; Plasmodium falciparum,"Accuracy and precision; Causative agents; Comprehensive method; Deadly infectious disease; Detection mode; Extraction recovery; Hydrophilic interaction chromatography; Internal standards; Intracellular concentration; Intracellular parasites; Ion pair liquid chromatography; Ion-pairing reagent; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Lower limit of quantitations; Metabolomic analysis; Metabolomics; Parasite-; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium parasites; Polar compounds; Red blood cell; Reliable measurement; Reverse phase; Standard addition method; Standard curves; Succinic acids; Amino acids; Biochemistry; Biomolecules; Carbohydrates; Carboxylic acids; Diseases; Ionic liquids; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; Phospholipids; Enzyme activity; 4 aminobutanol; alkanolamine; amino acid; butyric acid derivative; carboxylic acid; choline; perfluorobutyric acid; succinic acid; unclassified drug; article; erythrocyte level; human; human cell; hydrophilic interaction chromatography; ion pair chromatography; limit of quantitation; lipid analysis; liquid chromatography; malaria falciparum; metabolite; metabolomics; molecular stability; nonhuman; phospholipid synthesis; Plasmodium falciparum; priority journal; quantitative analysis; tandem mass spectrometry; validation process; Amino Acids; Amino Alcohols; Carboxylic Acids; Choline; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Erythrocytes; Humans; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Limit of Detection; Linear Models; Lipids; Malaria, Falciparum; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Nucleotides; Plasmodium falciparum; Reference Standards; Reproducibility of Results; Succinic Acid; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Valine; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium parasites",
Management of cardiovascular disease risk factors in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury: An evidence-based review,"Cragg J.J., Stone J.A., Krassioukov A.V.",2012,Journal of Neurotrauma,"Clinical scenario: A 37-year-old man suffered a complete spinal cord injury (C8, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale [ASIA] score A) 10 years ago in a car accident. Should primary prevention of cardiovascular disease be a priority in this patient? In order to answer this question, we performed a systematic review of the literature to inform an evidence-based clinical review. The objective was to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the clinical management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Comprehensive literature searches were performed. The quality of each study was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale for randomized controlled trials, and the Downs and Black Scale for all other studies. Levels of evidence were assigned using a modified version of Sackett's scale. Our findings indicate that CVD is a critical issue in individuals with chronic SCI. Almost all risk factors for CVD are amplified in individuals with SCI, including physical inactivity, dyslipidemia, blood pressure irregularities, abnormal glycemic control, and chronic inflammation. However, there is a paucity of high-quality literature with respect to treatment outcomes in SCI-specific study populations (a total of 22 intervention studies in all of these categories combined) that allow for the development of evidence-informed clinical practice recommendations. These limitations notwithstanding, we present a series of contemporary practice suggestions with regard to CVD event risk modification in SCI patients. For optimal outcomes, health care providers should be cognizant of these heightened CVD risk factors and the resultant increased CVD morbidity and mortality in SCI patients. Despite the absence of high-quality evidence-based treatment strategies, clinicians should re-examine their own CVD risk factor treatment strategies to better reflect contemporary practice in similar high-CVD-event-risk patients and populations. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",cardiovascular disease; clinical review; management; risk factors; spinal cord injury,antihypertensive agent; captopril; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; nifedipine; prazosin; triacylglycerol; American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale; antihypertensive therapy; autonomic dysreflexia; bicycle ergometry; blood pressure fluctuation; brain hemorrhage; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; chronic disease; chronic inflammation; clinical practice; death; dyslipidemia; electrostimulation; evidence based practice; glycemic control; health care personnel; health care quality; heart infarction; high risk patient; high risk population; human; hypertension; hypertensive crisis; immobilization; low drug dose; orthosis; orthostatic hypotension; primary prevention; randomized controlled trial (topic); rating scale; resistance training; review; spinal cord injury; traffic accident; treadmill exercise; treatment outcome; triacylglycerol blood level; Cardiovascular Diseases; Chronic Disease; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Risk Factors; Spinal Cord Injuries,
Influence of the neurological level of spinal cord injury on cardiovascular outcomes in humans: A meta-analysis,"West C.R., Mills P., Krassioukov A.V.",2012,Spinal Cord,"Background:Although motor and sensory deficits following spinal cord injury (SCI) are well known, there are still contrasting reports on how SCI affects baseline cardiovascular (CV) parameters and other autonomic functions.Study design:Meta-analysis is performed.Objectives:To examine the effect of injury level on supine and seated CV function in individuals with SCI.Methods:A total of 98 studies representing 1968 individuals were retrieved for analysis. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were abstracted from the studies and compared between four groups according to the neurological lesion level, cervical (C) SCI (C4-C8), high-thoracic (HT) SCI (T1-T6), low-thoracic lumbar (LTL) SCI (below T6) and able-bodied (AB) controls.Results:In the supine position, SBP, DBP and HR were lower in C compared with HT, LTL and AB (all P0.04). In the seated position, SBP and DBP were significantly lower in C compared with LTL and AB (all P0.003) and HR was significantly lower in C compared with LTL only (P0.01). A final finding was that C exhibited a lower resting SBP in the seated compared with the supine position (P0.001).Conclusion:Individuals with SCI exhibit a lesion-dependent impairment in resting CV function, whereby those with the highest injury had the greatest degree of CV dysfunction. A further finding was that individuals with a C injury exhibited a lower resting SBP in the seated vs supine position. Thus, clinicians and researchers should consiDer lesion level and body position when measuring and interpreting CV parameters in individuals with SCI. © 2012 International Spinal Cord Society.",autonomic; blood pressure; heart rate; paraplegia; tetraplegia,body position; cardiovascular function; cardiovascular parameters; diastolic blood pressure; heart rate; human; meta analysis; priority journal; review; spinal cord injury; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; Cardiovascular Diseases; Comorbidity; Humans; Patient Positioning; Prevalence; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity; Spinal Cord Injuries; Trauma Severity Indices,
"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), an emerging drinking water contaminant: A critical review of recent literature","Post G.B., Cohn P.D., Cooper K.R.",2012,Environmental Research,"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is an anthropogenic contaminant that differs in several ways from most other well-studied organic chemicals found in drinking water. PFOA is extremely resistant to environmental degradation processes and thus persists indefinitely. Unlike most other persistent and bioaccumulative organic pollutants, PFOA is water-soluble, does not bind well to soil or sediments, and bioaccumulates in serum rather than in fat. It has been detected in finished drinking water and drinking water sources impacted by releases from industrial facilities and waste water treatment plants, as well as in waters with no known point sources. However, the overall occurrence and population exposure from drinking water is not known. PFOA persists in humans with a half-life of several years and is found in the serum of almost all U.S. residents and in populations worldwide. Exposure sources include food, food packaging, consumer products, house dust, and drinking water. Continued exposure to even relatively low concentrations in drinking water can substantially increase total human exposure, with a serum:drinking water ratio of about 100:1. For example, ongoing exposures to drinking water concentrations of 10. ng/L, 40. ng/L, 100 ng/L, or 400 ng/L are expected to increase mean serum levels by about 25%, 100%, 250%, and 1000%, respectively, from the general population background serum level of about 4. ng/mL. Infants are potentially a sensitive subpopulation for PFOA's developmental effects, and their exposure through breast milk from mothers who use contaminated drinking water and/or from formula prepared with contaminated drinking water is higher than in adults exposed to the same drinking water concentration. Numerous health endpoints are associated with human PFOA exposure in the general population, communities with contaminated drinking water, and workers. As is the case for most such epidemiology studies, causality for these effects is not proven. Unlike most other well-studied drinking water contaminants, the human dose-response curve for several effects appears to be steepest at the lower exposure levels, including the general population range, with no apparent threshold for some endpoints. There is concordance in animals and humans for some effects, while humans and animals appear to react differently for other effects such as lipid metabolism. PFOA was classified as ""likely to be carcinogenic in humans"" by the USEPA Science Advisory Board. In animal studies, developmental effects have been identified as more sensitive endpoints for toxicity than carcinogenicity or the long-established hepatic effects. Notably, exposure to an environmentally relevant drinking water concentration caused adverse effects on mammary gland development in mice. This paper reviews current information relevant to the assessment of PFOA as an emerging drinking water contaminant. This information suggests that continued human exposure to even relatively low concentrations of PFOA in drinking water results in elevated body burdens that may increase the risk of health effects. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",C8; Drinking water contaminants; Perfluorinated chemicals; Perfluorooctanoic acid; PFOA,"drinking water; perfluorooctanoate ammonium; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; uric acid; anthropogenic effect; assessment method; bioaccumulation; carcinogen; concentration (composition); drinking water; environmental degradation; epidemiology; health risk; hepatitis; literature review; metabolism; organic acid; organic pollutant; point source pollution; pollution effect; pollution exposure; water treatment; blood analysis; breast milk; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; cognition; concentration (parameters); consumer; exposure; fluorination; food packaging; house dust; human; immune system; liver; mammary gland; nonhuman; population research; priority journal; reproduction; review; toxicity testing; toxicokinetics; United States; uric acid blood level; waste water management; water contamination; water supply; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Octanoic Acids; United States; Water Pollutants, Chemical; United States; Animalia; Mus",
Meta-analysis of proximal femoral nail anti-rotation versus dynamic hip screw in the treatment of trochanteric fractures,"Zeng C., Wang Y., Wei J., Gao S., Yang T., Sun Z., Lei G.",2012,Journal of Central South University (Medical Sciences),"Objective: To compare the efficacy of proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA) versus dynamic hip screw (DHS) in the treatment of trochanteric fractures in adults. Methods: Reports of studies using randomized controlled trials (RCT) to compare PFNA with DHS in the management of intertrochanteric fractures were retrieved (up to December 5, 2011) from the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Elsevier, the Chinese Biomedical Database, Wanfang Data, and manually. Methodological quality of the trials was critically assessed, and relevant data were extracted. Statistical software Revman® 5.0 was used for data-analysis. Results; Thirteen RCTs involving 958 cases were included in the Meta-analysis. The results showed that, compared with DHS, PFNA significantly decreased the duration of surgery [WMD = -21.38, 95%CI (-33.05, -9.26), P<0.05], intra-operative blood loss [WMD = -176.36, 95%CI (-232.20, -120.52), P<0.05], the rate of post-operative complication [RR=0.46, 95%CI (0.31, 0.70), P<0.05], the rate of post-operative fixation failure [RR=0.27, 95%CI(0.11, 0.62), P<0.05]. Conclusion: PFNA for intertrochanteric fractures is superior to DHS in regards to the mean duration of surgery, mean intra-operative blood loss, the rate of post-operative complication, and the rate of post-operative fixation failure. But there is not enough evidence to show any difference between PFNA and DHS in regards to the mean duration of hospital, the mean duration of fracture healing, the rate of post-operative fracture, the rate of post-operative coxa vara, the rate of postoperative superficial wound infection, the rate of other post-operative complications or the Harris score after surgery.",Dynamic hip screw; Fracture fixation; Hip fractures; Internal; Meta-analysis; Proximal femoral nail anti-rotation,"article; bone nail; bone screw; China; fracture healing; hip fracture; human; meta analysis; methodology; operative blood loss; osteosynthesis; postoperative complication; randomized controlled trial (topic); statistics; Blood Loss, Surgical; Bone Nails; Bone Screws; China; Fracture Fixation, Internal; Fracture Healing; Hip Fractures; Humans; Postoperative Complications; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",

"Syntheses utilizing n-perfluoroalkyl iodides [R FI, C nF 2n+1-I] 2000-2010","Murphy P.M., Baldwin C.S., Buck R.C.",2012,Journal of Fluorine Chemistry,"This review presents a comprehensive assessment of the synthetic utility of n-perfluoroalkyl iodides (R FI, C nF 2n+1-I, where n = 2-14) in the published literature from 2000 through 2010. R FI is a versatile synthetic reagent widely utilized to introduce the perfluoroalkyl functionality and its unique functional characteristics into organic substances. Two distinct analysis tools were employed. First, Reaxys ® was employed to examine the versatility and occurrences of R FI in 1356 non-polymeric synthetic transformations. The most common R FI synthetic conversions were (i) free-radical addition to carbon-carbon double or triple bonds, (ii) coupling to aryl halides, and (iii) Grignard, organolithium, or similar R F anion addition to ketones and aldehydes. R FI were also used as a chain transfer reagent in free-radical polymerization reactions of fluorinated and other unsaturated monomers. Second, a complementary Chemical Abstracts' STN AnaVist ® search was employed to summarize the 779 publications describing reaction products that contained n-perfluoroalkyl chains (C nF 2n+1-, where n = 2-4). The most common uses for materials into which R FI was incorporated were surfactants, pesticides, electronic materials, pharmaceuticals, liquid crystals, dyes and optical materials, battery electrolytes, repellents, lubricants and polymerization catalysts. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Determination of Heavy Metal Content in Vegetables and Oils From Spain and Morocco by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry,"Bakkali K., Martos N.R., Souhail B., Ballesteros E.",2012,Analytical Letters,"An optimized inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method was used to analyze trace metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, and Sn) in vegetable and oil samples. Prior to analysis, the samples were accurately weighed into a Teflon digestion vessel and the metals extracted from their matrix by using nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide in a closed-vessel digestion system. The proposed method is sensitive, with limits of detection between 5 and 38 ng/kg, and precise, with relative standard deviations from 2.8 to 6.1%. In order to verify its accuracy, the method was used to analyze the Standard Reference Materials NCS ZC85006 Tomato and Certified Used Oil HU-1. The method was successfully applied to the comparative determination of residues of the studied metals in vegetable (tomato, pepper, onion, spinach, lettuce, carrots, and marrow squash) and oil samples (virgin olive, maize, sunflower, and olive pomace) from Spain and Morocco. The results obtained revealed that the contents in metal residues depend on the particular type of food and its origin, probably due to the different production, processing, storage, and preservation methods. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Certified reference material; Heavy metals; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Oils; Vegetables,Allium cepa; Daucus carota; Helianthus; Lactuca; Lycopersicon esculentum; Spinacia oleracea; Zea mays,
Automatic microemulsion preparation for metals determination in fuel samples using a flow-batch analyzer and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry,"Cunha F.A.S., Sousa R.A., Harding D.P., Cadore S., Almeida L.F., Araújo M.C.U.",2012,Analytica Chimica Acta,"The principal thermodynamic advantages of using microemulsions over standard emulsions for flow metal analysis are the greatly increased analyte stability and emulsive homogeneity that improve both the ease of sample preparation, and the analytical result. In this study a piston propelled flow-batch analyzer (PFBA) for the determination of Cu, Cr and Pb in gasoline and naphtha by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF AAS) was explored. Investigative phase modeling for low dilution was conducted both for gasoline and naphtha microemulsions. Rheological considerations were also explored including a mathematical flow derivation to fine tune the system's operational parameters, and the GF AAS coupling. Both manual and automated procedures for microemulsion preparation were compared. The results of the paired t test at a 95% confidence level showed no significant differences between them. Further recovery test results confirmed a negligible matrix effect of the sample on the analyte absorption signals and an efficient stabilization of the samples (with metals) submitted to microemulsion treatment. The accuracy of the developed procedure was attested by good recovery percentages in the ranges of 100.0. ±. 3.5% for Pb in the naphtha samples, and 100.2. ±. 3.4% and 100.7. ±. 4.6% for Cu and Cr, respectively in gasoline samples. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Flow-batch analyser; Gasoline; GFAAS; Microemulsions; Naphtha; Trace metals,Absorption signals; Analytes; Analytical results; Automated procedures; Confidence levels; Flow-batch analyser; Fuel samples; Gasoline samples; GFAAS; Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry; Matrix effects; Microemulsion treatment; Operational parameters; Phase modeling; Recovery test; Sample preparation; T-tests; Trace metal; Gasoline; Lead; Metal analysis; Naphthas; Microemulsions; chromium; copper; gasoline; lead; naphtha; absorption; accuracy; analytical equipment; article; atomic absorption spectrometry; automation; chemical analysis; flow kinetics; graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry; intermethod comparison; mathematical analysis; metal recovery; microemulsion; piston propelled flow batch analyzer; priority journal,
The impact of vesicoureteral reflux treatment on the incidence of urinary tract infection,"Wadie G.M., Moriarty K.P.",2012,Pediatric Nephrology,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a heterogeneous disease and its management remains one of the most controversial topics in pediatrics. Management options include surveillance, antibiotics, and surgery. The approval of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (DHA) as a bulking agent by the Food and Drug Administration was followed by wide acceptance of endoscopic techniques as a major tool in the management of reflux. Pyelonephritis rather than VUR is the most common cause of kidney damage in children. It should be emphasized that the primary goal of diagnosing and treating VUR should be preventing this complication. There are no sufficient data in the literature to address the impact of the different treatment modalities on the incidence of febrile urinary tract infections (feb-UTIs) denoting pyelonephritis, with very few studies evaluating endoscopic treatment in light of this clear and well-defined outcome. The fact that we can correct the anatomy at the vesicoureteral junction with a simple and relatively safe outpatient procedure does not justify offering it to all patients. In this review, we attempt to critically evaluate the available literature pertaining to the impact of different treatment modalities on reducing the incidence of febrile UTIs and kidney damage, with a special emphasis on endoscopic treatment. © IPNA 2011.",Deflux®; Endoscopic treatment; Reflux nephropathy; Renal scaring; Urinary tract infection; Vesicoureteral reflux,bulking agent; dextranomer; dimeticone; hyaluronic acid; politef; endoscopic surgery; endoscopy; food and drug administration; human; incidence; kidney injury; patient safety; priority journal; pyelonephritis; review; urinary tract infection; vesicoureteral reflux; ureteroscopy; urinary tract infection; vesicoureteral reflux; Humans; Incidence; Ureteroscopy; Urinary Tract Infections; Vesico-Ureteral Reflux,
In situ derivatization-liquid liquid extraction as a sample preparation strategy for the determination of urinary biomarker prolyl-4-hydroxyproline by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry,"Cimlová J., Kružberská P., Švagera Z., Hušek P., Šimek P.",2012,Journal of Mass Spectrometry,"Polar analytes that possess protic functional groups have often been treated with alkyl chloroformates to decrease their polarity and increase their volatility prior to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. This derivatization reaction has two distinct advantages. It proceeds smoothly in aqueous media, and the desired reaction products are efficiently separated from interfering ionic components by their extraction into a water-immiscible organic phase. In the present work, the derivatization-liquid liquid sample preparation was examined in detail for analysis of a potential urinary dipeptide biomarker l-prolyl-4-l-hydroxyproline (PHP) by downstream liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry. PHP was treated with a series of alkyl and fluoroalkyl chloroformates in aqueous media, and the detected reaction products were investigated. Smooth conversion of PHP into the N-isobutyloxycarbonyl isobutyl ester was accomplished by the coupled action of isobutanol, isobutyl chloroformate and the pyridine catalyst. This derivative afforded a highest detector response from all the derivatized forms examined, including the nonderivatized PHP. A simple isocratic elution on a common RP-C18 HPLC column coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, and use of the synthesized heptadeuterated analog (D7-PHP) as an internal standard, enabled validation of the method and determination of PHP in human urine in less than 5min. The in situ derivatization-liquid liquid extraction has thus been demonstrated to be a useful sample preparation strategy for the analysis of polar metabolites by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in the complex urine matrix. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",alkyl chloroformate derivatization; LC-MS/MS; liquid liquid extraction; prolyl-4-hydroxyproline; urine,"Derivatizations; LC-MS/MS; liquid liquid extraction; prolyl-4-hydroxyproline; urine; Body fluids; Functional groups; Gas chromatography; High pressure liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Reaction products; Solvent extraction; Liquids; chloroform; hydroxyproline; isobutanol; levo prolyl 4 levo hydroxyproline; pyridine; unclassified drug; aqueous solution; article; catalysis; chemical structure; derivatization; downstream processing; electrospray mass spectrometry; high performance liquid chromatography; human; liquid chromatography; liquid liquid extraction; priority journal; tandem mass spectrometry; urinalysis; Biological Markers; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Dipeptides; Drug Stability; Humans; Linear Models; Liquid-Liquid Extraction; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",

"Halonitroalkanes, halonitriles, haloamides, and N-nitrosamines: A critical review of nitrogenous disinfection byproduct formation pathways","Shah A.D., Mitch W.A.",2012,Environmental Science and Technology,"Interest in the formation of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts (N-DBPs) has increased because toxicological research has indicated that they are often more genotoxic, cytotoxic, or carcinogenic than many of the carbonaceous disinfection byproducts (C-DBPs) that have been a focus for previous research. Moreover, population growth has forced utilities to exploit source waters impaired by wastewater effluents or algal blooms. Both waters feature higher levels of organic nitrogen, that might serve as N-DBP precursors. Utilities are exploring new disinfectant combinations to reduce the formation of regulated trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids. As some of these new combinations may promote N-DBP formation, characterization of N-DBP formation pathways is needed. Formation pathways for halonitroalkanes, halonitriles, haloamides, and N-nitrosamines associated with chlorine, ozone, chlorine dioxide, UV, and chloramine disinfection are critically reviewed. Several important themes emerge from the review. First, the formation pathways of the N-DBP families are partially linked because most of the pathways involve similar amine precursors. Second, it is unlikely that a disinfection scheme that is free of byproduct formation will be discovered. Disinfectant combinations should be optimized to reduce the overall exposure to toxic byproducts. Third, the understanding of formation pathways should be employed to devise methods of applying disinfectants that minimize byproduct formation while accomplishing pathogen reduction goals. Fourth, the well-characterized nature of the monomers constituting the biopolymers that likely dominate the organic nitrogen precursor pool should be exploited to predict the formation of byproducts likely to form at high yields. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Algal blooms; Amine precursor; By-product formation; Chlorine dioxides; Critical review; Cytotoxic; Disinfection by-product; Formation pathways; Genotoxic; Haloacetic acids; High yield; N-nitrosamines; Organic nitrogen; Pathogen reduction; Population growth; Source waters; Toxic byproducts; Toxicological research; Trihalomethanes; Wastewater effluents; Biopolymers; Byproducts; Chlorine; Disinfectants; Effluents; Ozone; Population statistics; Wastewater; Disinfection; aldehyde; amino acid; biopolymer; carboxylic acid; chlorine; chlorine dioxide; chloropicrin; dimethylhydrazine; dissolved organic matter; drinking water; haloamide; halonitrile; halonitroalkane; humic acid; hydrochloric acid; hydroxide; hypochlorite; monochloramine; nitrile; nitrite; nitrosamine; organic nitrogen; organohalogen derivative; ozone; poly(epichlorohydrin dimethylamine); polyamine; tosylchloramide sodium; unclassified drug; algal bloom; disinfection; formation mechanism; organic nitrogen compound; polymer; population growth; toxicology; wastewater; amination; catalysis; chemical bond; chloramination; chlorination; concentration (parameters); decarboxylation; dechlorination; disinfection; effluent; electron transport; exposure; halogenation; hydrolysis; nonhuman; oxidation; ozonation; pH; photolysis; review; substitution reaction; sunlight; ultraviolet radiation; waste water recycling; Alkanes; Amides; Disinfection; Hydrocarbons, Halogenated; Nitriles; Nitrosamines; algae",
Risks and benefits of consumption of great lakes fish,"Turyk M.E., Bhavsar S.P., Bowerman W., Boysen E., Clark M., Diamond M., Mergler D., Pantazopoulos P., Schantz S., Carpenter D.O.",2012,Environmental Health Perspectives,"Background: Beneficial effects of fish consumption on early cognitive development and cardiovascular health have been attributed to the omega-3 fatty acids in fish and fish oils, but toxic chemicals in fish may adversely affect these health outcomes. Risk-benefit assessments of fish consumption have frequently focused on methylmercury and omega-3 fatty acids, not persistent pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls, and none have evaluated Great Lakes fish consumption. Objectives: The risks and benefits of fish consumption have been established primarily for marine fish. Here, we examine whether sufficient data are available to evaluate the risks and benefits of eating freshwater fish from the Great Lakes. Methods: We used a scoping review to integrate information from multiple state, provincial, and federal agency sources regarding the contaminants and omega-3 fatty acids in Great Lakes fish and fish consumers, consumption rates and fish consumption advisories, and health effects of contaminants and omega-3 fatty acids. Data synthesis: Great Lakes fish contain persistent contaminants-many of which have documented adverse health effects -that accumulate in humans consuming them. In contrast, data are sparse on omega-3 fatty acids in the fish and their consumers. Moreover, few studies have documented the social and cultural benefits of Great Lakes fish consumption, particularly for subsistence fishers and native communities. At this time, federal and state/provincial governments provide fish consumption advisories based solely on risk. Conclusions: Our knowledge of Great Lakes fish has critical gaps, particularly regarding the benefits of consumption. A risk-benefit analysis requires more information than is currently available on the concentration of omega-3 fatty acids in Great Lakes fish and their absorption by fish eaters in addition to more information on the social, cultural, and health consequences of changes in the amount of fish consumed.",Dioxin; Fish consumption; Great lakes; Methylmercury; Omega-3 fatty acids; Pcbs; Risk assessment,"1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; aldrin; antioxidant; campheclor; carcinogen; chlorodane; chlorphenotane; dieldrin; docosahexaenoic acid; furan; icosapentaenoic acid; lead; methylmercury; mirex; omega 3 fatty acid; perfluoro compound; perfluoroctanesulfonate; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated naphthalene; saturated fatty acid; selenium; toxic substance; unclassified drug; bioaccumulation; cancer risk; cardiovascular disease; cognition; consumer; diet supplementation; environmental exposure; evidence based medicine; fatty acid blood level; food intake; freshwater fish; heart protection; human; lake; nerve cell differentiation; neurologic disease; nonhuman; organic pollution; pregnancy; prenatal development; prenatal exposure; priority journal; review; risk benefit analysis; risk reduction; sex difference; social environment; sudden death; water contamination","Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services"
The intraparotid facial nerve schwannoma: A diagnostic and management conundrum,"Gross B.C., Carlson M.L., Moore E.J., Driscoll C.L., Olsen K.D.",2012,American Journal of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Medicine and Surgery,"Objectives: The aims of the study were (1) to review the management strategy and clinical outcomes of all intraparotid facial nerve (FN) schwannomas (PFNSs) treated at a single tertiary academic center from 1975 to 2010 and (2) to summarize all previously reported cases of PFNS in the international literature. Study design: A retrospective cohort study and literature review. Methods: Fifteen patients were diagnosed and treated at the authors' institution from 1975 to 2010. In addition, 124 published cases were systematically reviewed. Results: The most common presentation of PFNS was a painless parotid mass with normal FN function. Eccentric, loosely attached intraparotid tumors underwent gross total resection with nerve preservation granting satisfactory postoperative FN function, whereas inseparable intraparotid tumors were observed in 8 cases with stable long-term size. Lesions that extended into the fallopian canal underwent complete resection with FN sacrifice and nerve grafting in 10 cases, whereas 1 patient received subtotal resection of the intraparotid portion with stereotactic radiotherapy targeting the intratemporal component. Conclusions: Intraparotid FN schwannomas present similar to other primary salivary gland neoplasms, making an early diagnosis challenging. Intraoperative recognition of gross tumor characteristics and early histologic diagnosis with strategic biopsy are critical. Information including tumor location and extent, preoperative FN function, and the gross relationship between the tumor and the FN may guide the surgeon toward an optimal treatment plan emphasizing long-term neurologic preservation. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,cancer surgery; cohort analysis; human; intraparotid facial nerve schwannoma; mastoidectomy; medical record review; nerve transplantation; neurilemoma; outcome assessment; parotidectomy; postoperative period; priority journal; review; systematic review; tumor volume,W.B.

"Chemical characterization and factor analysis of PM2.5 in two sites of Monterrey, Mexico","Martinez M.A., Caballero P., Carrillo O., Mendoza A., Mejia G.M.",2012,Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association,"The Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA) has shown a high concentration of PM2.5 in its atmosphere since 2003. The contribution of possible sources of primary PM2.5 and its precursors is not known. In this paper we present the results of analyzing the chemical composition of sixty 24-hr samples of PM2.5 to determine possible sources of PM2.5 in the MMA. The samples were collected at the northeast and southeast of theMMA between November 22 andDecember 12, 2007, using low-volume devices. Teflon and quartz filters were used to collect the samples. The concentrations of 16 airborne trace elements were determined using x-ray fluorescence (XRF). Anions and cations were determined using ion chromatography. Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were determined by thermal optical analysis. The results show that Ca had the maximum mean concentration of all elements studied, followed by S. Enrichment factors above 50 were calculated for S, Cl, Cu, Zn, Br, and Pb. This indicates that these elements may come from anthropogenic sources. Overall, the major average components of PM2.5 were OC (41.7%), SO42- (22.9%), EC (7.4%), crustal material (11.4%), and NO3- (12.6%), which altogether accounted for 96% of the mass. Statistically, we did not find any difference in SO42- concentrations between the two sites. The fraction of secondary organic carbon was between 24% and 34%. The results of the factor analysis performed over 10 metals and OC and EC show that there are three main sources of PM2.5: crustal material and vehicle exhaust; industrial activity; and fuel oil burning. The results show that SO42-, OC, and crustal material are important components of PM2.5 in MMA. Further work is necessary to evaluate the proportion of secondary inorganic and organic aerosol in order to have a better understanding of the sources and precursors of aerosols in the MMA. Implications: The MMA has become one of the most air polluted areas in Mexico. High levels of PM2.5 have been measured and effective actions need to be taken to reduce air pollution and the associated health risks. Several sources of primary PM2.5 and precursors of secondary particles exist in theMMA. This study provides valuable information for the local environmental authorities to identify possible sources of primary PM2.5 and its precursors. The effectiveness of the actions taken to improve air quality will lead to health benefits for the population, reducing their associated costs. © 2012 A&amp;WMA.",,"Aerosols; Air quality; Health risks; Ion chromatography; Multivariant analysis; Organic carbon; Risk assessment; Trace elements; Anthropogenic sources; Chemical characterization; Chemical compositions; Environmental Authority; Industrial activities; Monterrey metropolitan areas; Secondary organic carbon; Thermal-optical analysis; Factor analysis; anion; carbon; cation; elemental carbon; organic compound; politef; silicon dioxide; unclassified drug; carbon; airborne particle; anthropology; article; chemical composition; ion pair chromatography; Mexico; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; thermal analysis; thermal optical analysis; X ray fluorescence; air pollutant; algorithm; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; factorial analysis; methodology; particle size; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Algorithms; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Mexico; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Taylor and Francis Inc.
The potential role of Flexible Transport Services in enhancing rural public transport provision,"Velaga N.R., Nelson J.D., Wright S.D., Farrington J.H.",2012,Journal of Public Transportation,"This paper explores the existing context of public transport provision in rural and remote areas illustrated with experience from Scotland. A critical review of existing Flexible Transport Services (FTS) in rural areas is provided and illustrated with selected case studies, with the objective of identifying the extent to which FTS can enhance the public transport offer. Findings confirm that FTS offers considerable potential to contribute to and support the public transport system in rural areas; however, the paper also identifies the many challenges in successful development or enhancement of FTS in rural areas.",,,University of South Florida
Determination of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and their metabolites in milk by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry,"Jedziniak P., Szprengier-Juszkiewicz T., Pietruk K., Ledziska E., Żmudzki J.",2012,Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely used for treatment of animals. According to Council Directive 96/23/EC, residues of these drugs must be monitored because of the potential risk they pose to the consumers' health. For this reason an LC-MS-MS method was developed for detection of wide range of NSAIDs, including both ""acidic"" NSAIDs (carprofen, diclofenac, flunixin, meloxicam, phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, tolfenamic acid, mefenamic acid, naproxen, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, firocoxib, rofecoxib, and celecoxib) and ""basic"" NSAIDs (four metamizole metabolites). Analytes were extracted from milk samples with acetonitrile in the presence of ammonium acetate. One portion of the extract was directly analyzed for the presence of metamizole metabolites; a second portion was cleaned with an amino cartridge. All NSAIDs were separated on a Phenomenex Luna C8(2) column and analyzed by LC-MS-MS in negative (acidic NSAIDs) and positive (metamizole metabolites) ion modes. The method was validated in accordance with the requirements of Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. Within-laboratory reproducibility was in the range 7-28%, and accuracy was in the range 71-116%. The method enabled detection of all the analytes with the expected sensitivity, below the recommended concentrations. The method fulfills the criteria for confirmatory methods and, because of its efficiency, may also be used for screening purposes. The procedure was also successfully verified in the proficiency test organized by EU-RL in 2010. As far as the authors are aware, this is one of the first methods capable of detecting diclofenac residues below the MRL in milk (0.1 μg kg1). An additional advantage is the possibility of simultaneous determination of ""acidic"" NSAIDs and metamizole metabolites. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Diclofenac; Drugs in milk; Metamizole; Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,Biomolecules; Health risks; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; Commission Decision 2002/657/EC; Diclofenac; Drugs in milk; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Metamizole; Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; Reproducibilities; Simultaneous determinations; Drug products; Animalia,Springer Verlag

As a consequence, residues generated from past mining activities over the years have been dumped as piles of tailings. Zäda is one of the most affected region in this basin because of lead mine exploitation for long time. The aim of this study is to determine the amount of trace elements and the contamination of the river sediments. Analysis of collected samples has been achieved using the prompt gamma activation analysis method. The samples, in form of powders, were enclosed in Teflon sheets. The spectra were analyzed using HYPERMET PC software and the chemical composition is calculated using an Excelmacro that provides the concentrations as molar and weight percentages, as well as the corresponding masses of the oxides. The validation of the analytical method is demonstrated with the analysis of a reference material. The results show that the distribution of the studied metals (Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr Ni, and As) in the basin is dependent on location with a very significant contamination by Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr, and Ni close to the lead mine sites. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary 2011.",Environmental pollution; Moulouya Oued; Sediments; Trace elements; Zäda mine,arsenic; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; lead; metal oxide; nickel; politef; trace element; zinc; chemical composition; chemical procedures; computer program; conference paper; lake; metal recovery; mining; prompt gamma activation analysis; river; river basin; sampling; sediment; validation process; water contamination,
Progress and perspective of perfluorinated compound risk assessment and management in various countries and institutes,"Zushi Y., Hogarh J.N., Masunaga S.",2012,Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,"Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and related compounds have recently been designated as target chemicals for regulation by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). Many countries have investigated and tried to implement various countermea-sures in response to this decision. In this article, we collect reports concerning regulations and risk evaluations of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and review the current PFC management practiced in various countries. The first part of this review contains a comprehensive collection of proposed standard PFC values, including provisional tolerable daily intakes (pTDI), drinking water guidelines, and predicted non-effect concentrations (PNEC). The pTDI values ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 μg/kg/day for PFOS, and there are wide margins of safety for adults. Health risks for plant workers exposed to PFCs and for infants are of particular concern. The application of these proposed values in controlling PFC pollution is one approach that may effectively control human health risk without unduly sacrificing the benefits from PFC use. The second part of this review contains a collection and review of a number of regulations and countermeasures, such as an EU directive, regulation in Canada, and the Significant New Use Rule (SNUR), including voluntary control (i.e., production phase-out by 3M, stewardship programs, regulation in the semiconductor industry). Most of these regulations are based principally on the precautionary principle. However, they may not be as effective in pollution reduction as intended because the chemicals in question are already widely distributed in the environment owing to their use and mobility in the environment. In addition, these types of regulations would be non-operative in developing countries because rapidly growing economies place great demand on high performance materials, including PFCs. Further development of risk assessment methods that allow the evaluation of the counter risks of PFC alternatives and the loss of benefits from the PFC ban is necessary because of the possible continuous use of PFCs, especially in developing countries. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Guideline; Management; Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs); Regulation; Risk assessment; TDI,Developing countries; Health risks; Management; Organic chemicals; Organic pollutants; Pollution control; Potable water; Semiconductor device manufacture; Guideline; High performance material; Perfluorinated compound (PFCs); Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Persistent organic pollutants; Regulation; Risk assessment and managements; Significant new use rules; Risk assessment,Springer Verlag

"Pyrene-functionalized oligonucleotides and locked nucleic acids (LNAs): Tools for fundamental research, diagnostics, and nanotechnology","Østergaard M.E., Hrdlicka P.J.",2011,Chemical Society Reviews,"Pyrene-functionalized oligonucleotides (PFOs) are increasingly explored as tools in fundamental research, diagnostics and nanotechnology. Their popularity is linked to the ability of pyrenes to function as polarity-sensitive and quenchable fluorophores, excimer-generating units, aromatic stacking moieties and nucleic acid duplex intercalators. These characteristics have enabled development of PFOs for detection of complementary DNA/RNA targets, discrimination of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and generation of π-arrays on nucleic acid scaffolds. This critical review will highlight the physical properties and applications of PFOs that are likely to provide high degree of positional control of the chromophore in nucleic acid complexes. Particular emphasis will be placed on pyrene-functionalized Locked Nucleic Acids (LNAs) since these materials display interesting properties such as fluorescence quantum yields approaching unity and recognition of mixed-sequence double stranded DNA (144 references). © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,
"A critical review of cyclic transient membrane gas separation processes: State of the art, opportunities and limitations","Wang L., Corriou J.-P., Castel C., Favre E.",2011,Journal of Membrane Science,"Membrane gas separations under transient state conditions are rather unexplored compared to steady-state operations. In a first step, the various theoretical and experimental studies performed on membrane gas separation processes under cyclic operations are reviewed. With respect to the cycle duration, these operations are classified into short and long classes. In a second step, a systematic analysis of the potential interest of the short class of cyclic operation compared to steady-state performances, namely an improved selectivity or a reverse selectivity, has been performed based on trade-off correlations applied to 2145 gas pairs. A series of gas pairs of potential interest for transient operation has been identified thanks to this approach. Four case studies ({He,N2}, {He,Ar}, {H2,C3H8} and UF6 isotopes), based on experimental solubility and diffusion data, have been investigated and the optimized separation performances for cyclic operations are compared to steady-state operations in terms of selectivity and productivity. Generally speaking, the possibility to increase the separation selectivity by cyclic operation logically needs to be carefully counterbalanced by a decrease in productivity. Finally, further work, potential applications and unexplored issues of cyclic membrane gas separation processes are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Cyclic operation; Gas; Membrane; Separation; Time lag,"Critical review; Cycle duration; Cyclic operation; Cyclic transients; Diffusion data; Experimental studies; Gas separation process; Gas separations; Potential applications; Separation performance; Separation selectivity; State of the art; Steady state performance; Steady-state operation; Systematic analysis; Time lag; Transient operation; Transient state; Gases; Isotopes; Membranes; Productivity; Separation; Gas permeable membranes; carbon dioxide; dichlorodifluoromethane; hydrogen; nitrogen; perfluoro 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 dioxole; perfluoro compound; unclassified drug; analytical parameters; article; classification; concentration (parameters); diffusion; diffusion coefficient; flow rate; gas flow; gas permeability; membrane gas separation; membrane permeability; membrane transport; pressure; priority journal; process optimization; separation technique; simulation; solubility; steady state; theoretical model",
"Determination of fentanyl, metabolite and analogs in urine by GC/MS","Strano-Rossi S., Álvarez I., Tabernero M.J., Cabarcos P., Fernández P., Bermejo A.M.",2011,Journal of Applied Toxicology,"A rapid and sensitive method for the simultaneous determination of alfentanyl, sufentanyl and fentanyl (and its major metabolite norfentanyl) in urine was developed and validated. The method involved a liquid-liquid extraction in alkaline conditions, derivatization with pentafluoropropionic anhydride to improve the sensitivity for norfentanyl and subsequent analysis in GC/MS. The LODs are 0.08ngml -1 for all substances (0.04ngml -1 for alfentanyl). Intra- and inter-day precision coefficient of variation was always below 15%; mean relative error (accuracy) was always below 15%. The method was linear for all analytes, with quadratic regression of calibration curves always higher than 0.99. The method was applied to real samples of subjects who had received therapeutic doses of fentanyl, showing its suitability for the determination of low levels of these substances.

Monitoring of perfluorinated compounds in aquatic biota: An updated review,"Houde M., De Silva A.O., Muir D.C.G., Letcher R.J.",2011,Environmental Science and Technology,"The goal of this article is to summarize new biological monitoring information on perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in aquatic ecosystems (post-2005) as a followup to our critical review published in 2006. A wider range of geographical locations (e.g., South America, Russia, Antarctica) and habitats (e.g., high-mountain lakes, deep-ocean, and offshore waters) have been investigated in recent years enabling a better understanding of the global distribution of PFCs in aquatic organisms. High concentrations of PFCs continue to be detected in invertebrates, fish, reptiles, and marine mammals worldwide. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is still the predominant PFC detected (mean concentrations up to 1900 ng/g ww) in addition to important concentrations of long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs; sum PFCAs up to 400 ng/g ww). More studies have evaluated the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of these compounds in both freshwater and marine food webs. Several reports have indicated a decrease in PFOS levels over time in contrast to PFCA concentrations that have tended to increase in tissues of aquatic organisms at many locations. The detection of precursor metabolites and isomers has become more frequently reported in environmental assessments yielding important information on the sources and distribution of these contaminants. The integration of environmental/ecological characteristics (e.g., latitude/longitude, salinity, and/or trophic status at sampling locations) and biological variables (e.g., age, gender, life cycle, migration, diet composition, growth rate, food chain length, metabolism, and elimination) are essential elements in order to adequately study the environmental fate and distribution of PFCs and should be more frequently considered in study design. © Published 2011 by the American Chemical Society.",,"Antarctica; Aquatic biota; Aquatic ecosystem; Aquatic organisms; Biological monitoring; Biological variables; Biomagnification; Critical review; Environmental assessment; Environmental fate; Essential elements; Geographical locations; Global distribution; High concentration; Marine food web; Marine mammals; Mean concentrations; Offshore water; Perfluorinated compounds; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Sampling location; South America; Study design; Trophic status; Biochemistry; Carboxylation; Ecosystems; Geographical distribution; Isomers; Mammals; Metabolism; Tissue; Chemical contamination; carboxylic acid derivative; fresh water; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl carboxylate; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; unclassified drug; bioaccumulation; dose-response relationship; environmental assessment; environmental fate; fish; food web; freshwater ecosystem; invertebrate; literature review; marine ecosystem; marine mammal; metabolite; pollutant transport; reptile; age distribution; Antarctica; aquatic environment; aquatic species; bioaccumulation; dietary intake; elimination reaction; environmental monitoring; fish; follow up; food chain; geographic distribution; growth rate; invertebrate; lake; latitude; life cycle; marine biology; metabolism; migration; nonhuman; reptile; review; Russian Federation; salinity; sea; sex difference; South America; trophic cascade; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Biota; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution; Antarctica; Russian Federation; South America; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Reptilia",
Analysis of trace metals in single droplet of urine by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,"Kumtabtim U., Siripinyanond A., Auray-Blais C., Ntwari A., Becker J.S.",2011,International Journal of Mass Spectrometry,"Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is now widely accepted as a universal and sensitive analytical technique in different research fields. In this project, we applied the technology to the analysis of complex matrix composition by using urine samples from Fabry disease patients and controls. The aims of the project were: (1) to develop a new and rapid analytical procedure for the determination of trace metal concentrations in single droplets of urine using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS); and (2) to establish preliminary results for trace metal concentrations in Fabry disease patient urine samples and controls. The processing of samples required only drying a homogeneous urine sample. Different supports (or sample substrates) were used: Teflon sheets, Whatman 903 filter paper, Urine Kid paper and glass slides. In order to establish the merits of the analytical method developed, matrix-matched synthetic laboratory standards spiked with analytes of interest were prepared at low concentrations (μg L-1 level). The precision and accuracy of the analytical method were &lt;20% (LA-ICP-MS) for trace metals in 1 μL urine laboratory standards (at analyte concentrations of 300 ng mL-1). The limit of detection varied from 0.003 to 0.58 μg g-1 for lithium, boron, titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, arsenic, rubidium, strontium, molybdenum, silver, cadmium, barium, lead, and uranium. LA-ICP-MS allowed the quantification and comparison of different trace metals in urine samples from a Fabry disease patient and from a reference control individual. This method may be applicable to forensic science, particularly when only a small amount of dried urine sample is available for investigation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Bioimaging; Fabry disease; Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Metals; Urine,,Elsevier B.V.

As many compounds were identified, arises the question of which ones to consider. Sensitive and selective analytical methods for simultaneous determination of targeted substances should be developed and evaluated. Various methods were described for sampling and sample preparation. Harmonization and standardization are needed to enable comparison of results from similar studies.

"Ultrasound-mediated tumor imaging and nanotherapy using drug loaded, block copolymer stabilized perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions","Rapoport N., Nam K.-H., Gupta R., Gao Z., Mohan P., Payne A., Todd N., Liu X., Kim T., Shea J., Scaife C., Parker D.L., Jeong E.-K., Kennedy A.M.",2011,Journal of Controlled Release,"Perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions can deliver lipophilic therapeutic agents to solid tumors and simultaneously provide for monitoring nanocarrier biodistribution via ultrasonography and/or 19F MRI. In the first generation of block copolymer stabilized perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions, perfluoropentane (PFP) was used as the droplet forming compound. Although manifesting excellent therapeutic and ultrasound imaging properties, PFP nanoemulsions were unstable at storage, difficult to handle, and underwent hard to control phenomenon of irreversible droplet-to-bubble transition upon injection. To solve the above problems, perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether (PFCE) was used as a core forming compound in the second generation of block copolymer stabilized perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions. PFCE nanodroplets manifest both ultrasound and fluorine (19F) MR contrast properties, which allows using multimodal imaging and 19F MR spectroscopy for monitoring nanodroplet pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. In the present paper, acoustic, imaging, and therapeutic properties of unloaded and paclitaxel (PTX) loaded PFCE nanoemulsions are reported. As manifested by the 19F MR spectroscopy, PFCE nanodroplets are long circulating, with about 50% of the injected dose remaining in circulation 2 h after the systemic injection. Sonication with 1-MHz therapeutic ultrasound triggered reversible droplet-to-bubble transition in PFCE nanoemulsions. Microbubbles formed by acoustic vaporization of nanodroplets underwent stable cavitation. The nanodroplet size (200 nm to 350 nm depending on a type of the shell and conditions of emulsification) as well as long residence in circulation favored their passive accumulation in tumor tissue that was confirmed by ultrasonography.

Nitric oxide signaling as a common target of organohalogens and other neuroendocrine disruptors,Currás-Collazo M.C.,2011,Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health - Part B: Critical Reviews,"Organohalogen compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) are global environmental pollutants and highly persistent, bioaccumulative chemicals that produce adverse effects in humans and wildlife. Because of the widespread use of these organohalogens in household items and consumer products, indoor contamination is a significant source of human exposure, especially for children. One significant concern with regard to health effects associated with exposure to organohalogens is endocrine disruption. Toxicological studies on organohalogen pollutants primarily focused on sex steroid and thyroid hormone actions, and findings have largely shaped the way one envisions their disruptive effects occurring. Organohalogens exert additional effects on other systems including other complex endocrine systems that may be disregulated at various levels of organization. Over the last 20 years evidence has mounted in favor of a critical role of nitric oxide (NO) in numerous functions ranging from neuroendocrine functions to learning and memory. With its participation in multiple systems and action at several levels of integration, NO signaling has a pervasive influence on nervous and endocrine functions. Like blockers of NO synthesis, PCBs and PBDEs produce multifaceted effects on physiological systems. Based on this unique set of converging information it is proposed that organohalogen actions occur, in part, by hijacking processes associated with this ubiquitous bioactive molecule. The current review examines the emerging evidence for NO involvement in selected organohalogen actions and includes recent progress from our laboratory that adds to our current understanding of the actions of organohalogens within hypothalamic neuroendocrine circuits. The thyroid, vasopressin, and reproductive systems as well as processes associated with long-term potentiation were selected as sample targets of organohalogens that rely on regulation by NO. Information is provided about other toxicants with demonstrated interference of NO signaling. Our focus on the convergence between NO system and organohalogen toxicity offers a novel approach to understanding endocrine and neuroendocrine disruption that is particularly problematic for developing organisms. This new working model is proposed as a way to encourage future study in elucidating common mechanisms of action that are selected with a better operational understanding of the systems affected.

Vitreous Substitutes: A Comprehensive Review,"Kleinberg T.T., Tzekov R.T., Stein L., Ravi N., Kaushal S.",2011,Survey of Ophthalmology,"Vitreoretinal disorders constitute a significant portion of treatable ocular disease. Advances in vitreoretinal surgery have included the development and characterization of suitable substitutes for the vitreous. Air, balanced salt solutions, perfluorocarbons, expansile gases, and silicone oil serve integral roles in modern vitreoretinal surgery. Vitreous substitutes vary widely in their properties, serve different clinical functions, and present different shortcomings. Permanent vitreous replacement has been attempted with collagen, hyaluronic acid, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and natural hydrogel polymers. None, however, have proven to be clinically viable. A long-term vitreous substitute remains to be found, and recent research suggests promise in the area of synthetic polymers. Here we review the currently available vitreous substitutes, as well those in the experimental phase. We classify these compounds based on their functionality, composition, and properties. We also discuss the clinical use, advantages, and shortcomings of the various substitutes. In addition we define the ideal vitreous substitute and highlight the need for a permanent substitute with long-term viability and compatibility. Finally, we attempt to define the future role of biomaterials research and the various functions they may serve in the area of vitreous substitutes. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Aging; Retinal detachment; Vitreoretinal surgery; Vitreous body; Vitreous detachment; Vitreous substitute,alkane; amino acid; ascorbic acid; biomaterial; biopolymer; chondroitin sulfate; collagen; fatty acid; fluorinated alkane; fluorocarbon; heparan sulfate; hyaluronic acid; lipid; perflutren; prostaglandin; silicone oil; sulfur hexafluoride; unclassified drug; accommodation; aging; biochemical composition; biocompatibility; biodegradability; biomechanics; blood retina barrier; cataract; cell culture; diabetic retinopathy; drug delivery system; elasticity; enzyme activity; gene therapy; human; hydrogel; implant; nonhuman; priority journal; retina detachment; retina macula hole; retina tear; review; vitreoretinopathy; vitreous body; vitreous body detachment; Eye Diseases; Humans; Viscoelastic Substances; Vitreoretinal Surgery; Vitreous Body,
Biological responses to Perfluorododecanoic acid exposure in rat kidneys as determined by integrated proteomic and metabonomic studies,"Zhang H., Ding L., Fang X., Shi Z., Zhang Y., Chen H., Yan X., Dai J.",2011,PLoS ONE,"Background: Perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) is a perfluorinated carboxylic chemical (PFC) that has broad applications and distribution in the environment. While many studies have focused on hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity of PFCAs, few have investigated renal toxicity. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we used comparative proteomic and metabonomic technologies to provide a global perspective on renal response to PFDoA. Male rats were exposed to 0, 0.05, 0.2, and 0.5 mg/kg/day of PFDoA for 110 days. After 2-D DIGE and MALDI TOF/TOF analysis, 79 differentially expressed proteins between the control and the PFDoA treated rats (0.2 and 0.5 mg-dosed groups) were successfully identified. These proteins were mainly involved in amino acid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, electron transport, and stress response. Nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabonomic analysis showed an increase in pyruvate, lactate, acetate, choline, and a variety of amino acids in the highest dose group. Furthermore, the profiles of free amino acids in the PFDoA treated groups were investigated quantitatively by high-coverage quantitative iTRAQ-LC MS/MS, which showed levels of sarcosine, asparagine, histidine, 1-methylhistidine, Ile, Leu, Val, Trp, Tyr, Phe, Cys, and Met increased markedly in the 0.5 mg dosed group, while homocitrulline, α-aminoadipic acid, β-alanine, and cystathionine decreased. Conclusion/Significance: These observations provide evidence that disorders in glucose and amino acid metabolism may contribute to PFDoA nephrotoxicity. Additionally, α2u globulin may play an important role in protecting the kidneys from PFDoA toxicity. © 2011 Zhang et al.",,"2 aminoadipic acid; acetic acid; amino acid; asparagine; beta alanine; choline; cystathionine; cysteine; histidine; histidine derivative; homocitrulline; isoleucine; lactic acid; leucine; methionine; perfluorodecanoic acid; phenylalanine; pyruvic acid; sarcosine; tryptophan; tyrosine; valine; amino acid; lauric acid derivative; perfluorododecanoic acid; amino acid metabolism; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; citric acid cycle; controlled study; electron transport; functional proteomics; gluconeogenesis; glycolysis; ion pair chromatography; long term exposure; male; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; metabolomics; nephrotoxicity; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; physical stress; protein expression; protein function; rat; tandem mass spectrometry; toxicity testing; two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis; animal; chemistry; dose response; drug effect; energy metabolism; human; kidney; mass spectrometry; metabolism; methodology; proteomics; Sprague Dawley rat; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; Rattus; Amino Acids; Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Kidney; Lauric Acids; Male; Metabolomics; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular; Proteomics; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization",
A critical review of interpositional grafts following temporomandibular joint discectomy with an overview of the dermis-fat graft,Dimitroulis G.,2011,International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,"The aim of this critical review is to determine what constitutes an ideal disc replacement material and whether any of the existing materials reported in the literature satisfy the requirements of an effective disc substitute following temporomandibular joint (TMJ) discectomy. Over the last half century a myriad of interpositional materials have been used in the TMJ but nearly all have been less than successful. The disasters that followed the early use of alloplastic interpositional implants in the 1980s prompted the increased use of autogenous grafts in the 1990s. Whilst studies by the author on the use of dermis-fat grafts have been largely positive, there are still concerns that make the dermis-fat graft a less than ideal interpositional material for use in discectomized joint cavities. In reviewing the literature, it is clear that there is still no ideal interpositional material that satisfies all the criteria for replacement of a missing articular disc following TMJ discectomy. © 2010 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.",,"biomaterial; sialastic; teflon proplast; unclassified drug; articular cartilage; autograft; bone erosion; composite skin graft; cross infection; device recall; disease severity; ear cartilage; epidermoid cyst; foreign body reaction; fragmentation reaction; human; implantation; inflammation; joint prosthesis; liquorrhea; lymph node; myofibrosis; patient safety; reoperation; review; scar formation; skin allograft; temporalis muscle; temporomandibular ankylosis; temporomandibular joint; temporomandibular joint discectomy; tissue engineering; xenograft; Adipose Tissue; Arthroplasty; Biocompatible Materials; Humans; Skin Transplantation; Temporomandibular Joint Disk; Transplantation, Autologous; Transplantation, Heterologous; Transplantation, Homologous; Treatment Outcome",
Conserved toxic responses across divergent phylogenetic lineages: A meta-analysis of the neurotoxic effects of RDX among multiple species using toxicogenomics,"Garcia-Reyero N., Habib T., Pirooznia M., Gust K.A., Gong P., Warner C., Wilbanks M., Perkins E.",2011,Ecotoxicology,"At military training sites, a variety of pollutants such as hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), may contaminate the area originating from used munitions. Studies investigating the mechanism of toxicity of RDX have shown that it affects the central nervous system causing seizures in humans and animals. Environmental pollutants such as RDX have the potential to affect many different species, therefore it is important to establish how phylogenetically distant species may respond to these types of emerging pollutants. In this paper, we have used a transcriptional network approach to compare and contrast the neurotoxic effects of RDX among five phylogenetically disparate species: rat (Sprague-Dawley), Northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), earthworm (Eisenia fetida), and coral (Acropora formosa). Pathway enrichment analysis indicated a conservation of RDX impacts on pathways related to neuronal function in rat, Northern bobwhite quail, fathead minnows and earthworm, but not in coral. As evolutionary distance increased common responses decreased with impacts on energy and metabolism dominating effects in coral. A neurotransmission related transcriptional network based on whole rat brain responses to RDX exposure was used to identify functionally related modules of genes, components of which were conserved across species depending upon evolutionary distance. Overall, the meta-analysis using genomic data of the effects of RDX on several species suggested a common and conserved mode of action of the chemical throughout phylogenetically remote organisms. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",GABAA receptor; Genomics; Meta-analysis; RDX; Species comparison,"4 aminobutyric acid A receptor; cyclonite; chemical pollutant; explosive; genomics; metabolism; phylogenetics; rodent; toxicology; article; controlled study; coral; earthworm; ecotoxicology; environmental exposure; gene expression regulation; genetic conservation; genetic distance; genetic transcription; genetic variability; genome analysis; neurotoxicity; neurotransmission; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; Pimephales promelas; priority journal; quail; species comparison; toxicogenetics; Animals; Anthozoa; Biological Evolution; Cyprinidae; Environmental Pollutants; Explosive Agents; Female; Neurons; Oligochaeta; Phylogeny; Quail; Rats; Receptors, GABA-A; Synaptic Transmission; Toxicogenetics; Triazines; Acropora formosa; Animalia; Anthozoa; Colinus virginianus; Eisenia fetida; Pimephales promelas; Rattus",

Environment and women's reproductive health,"Caserta D., Mantovani A., Marci R., Fazi A., Ciardo F., La Rocca C., Maranghi F., Moscarini M.",2011,Human Reproduction Update,"Background: There is significant evidence that continuous and prolonged exposure to several endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) is a risk factor for reduced fertility and fecundity in women. There is also evidence that ED exposure has trans-generational effects. In this systematic review, we evaluate the evidence for an association between EDC exposure and women's reproductive health. Methods: Studies were found by searching the PubMed database for articles published up to 2010. Associations between ED exposure and women's reproductive health reported in the PubMed database are summarized and classified as fertility and fecundity, pregnancy outcomes, transgenerational exposure and effects. Results: Epidemiological studies on EDCs are not always consistent, in part due to limitations imposed by practical constraints. In order to make progress in this field, we recommend taking advantage of biomonitoring and biobanks, including the development of appropriate biomarkers, and taking into greater consideration modulating factors such as genetic polymorphisms and dietary habits. Further human studies are warranted with particular focus on impaired fertility/fecundity associated with currently widespread ED (e.g. bisphenol A, phthalates and polybrominated flame retardants). Conclusions: A detailed appraisal of compounds specifically related to adverse reproductive outcomes is very important for prevention and risk-communication strategies. Besides research needs, the current evidence is sufficient to prompt precautionary actions to protect women's reproductive health. © The Author 2011.

Application of clutter reduction techniques for detection of metallic and low dielectric target behind the brick wall by stepped frequency continuous wave radar in ultra-wideband range,"Gaikwad A.N., Singh D., Nigam M.J.",2011,"IET Radar, Sonar and Navigation","A study of clutter reduction techniques for detection of metallic and non-metallic (low dielectric constant) targets behind a brick wall with the help of ultra-wideband (UWB) through wall imaging system is presented. It is known that sometimes the clutter level is comparable to the level of target reflection that makes it difficult to detect the target correctly. Detection of low dielectric constant materials becomes more difficult due to low reflection from such targets. Therefore there is a need to analyse various clutter removal techniques and check the performance of these techniques for enhancement of target signal-to-clutter ratio. For this purpose, an UWB stepped frequency wave radar is indigenously assembled with the use of vector network analyser, which works in the frequency range of 3.95-5.85 GHz. An experiment is carried out for detection of metal as well as Teflon (low dielectric constant) targets with the application of clutter reduction techniques. The authors have considered statistical-based techniques like singular value decomposition, principle component analysis, factor analysis and independent component analysis (ICA) for clutter removal. It is observed that the signal-to-clutter ratio for metal target detection is quite enhanced by all the four techniques, whereas only ICA is able to enhance the signal-to-clutter ratio for a low dielectric constant target like Teflon. © 2011 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,Brick wall; Clutter Reduction; Factor analysis; Frequency ranges; Low dielectric; Low dielectric constant materials; Low dielectric constants; Metal target; Non-metallic; Principle component analysis; Signal-to-clutter ratios; Stepped frequency; Stepped frequency continuous waves; Through-wall imaging; Vector networks; Wave radars; Brick; Clutter (information theory); Continuous wave radar; Dielectric materials; Independent component analysis; Metal analysis; Polytetrafluoroethylenes; Principal component analysis; Radar imaging; Signal detection; Singular value decomposition; Ultra-wideband (UWB),
Microchip based sample treatment device interfaced with ICP-MS for the analysis of transition metals from environmental samples,"AlSuhaimi A.O., McCreedy T.",2011,Arabian Journal of Chemistry,"A downscaled solid phase (SPE) device applicable for sample preparation prior to ICP-MS monitoring, have been constructed making use of the lab on a chip concept.

"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers and their hydroxylated/methoxylated analogs: Environmental sources, metabolic relationships, and relative toxicities","Wiseman S.B., Wan Y., Chang H., Zhang X., Hecker M., Jones P.D., Giesy J.P.",2011,Marine Pollution Bulletin,"Brominated compounds are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment. The polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants are anthropogenic compounds of concern. Studies suggest that PBDEs can be biotransformed to hydroxylated brominated diphenyl ethers (OH-BDE). However, the rate of OH-BDE formation observed has been extremely small. OH-BDEs have also been identified as natural compounds produced by some marine invertebrates. Another class of compounds, the methoxylated BDEs (MeO-BDEs), has also been identified as natural compounds in the marine environment. Both the OH-BDEs and MeO-BDEs bioaccumulate in higher marine organisms. Recent studies have demonstrated that MeO-BDEs can be biotransformed to OH-BDEs and this generates greater amounts of OH-BDEs than could be generated from PBDEs. Consequently, MeO-BDEs likely represent the primary source of metabolically derived OH-BDEs. Given that for some endpoints OH-BDEs often exhibit greater toxicity compared to PBDEs, it is prudent to consider OH-BDEs as chemicals of concern, despite their seemingly ""natural"" origins. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Biotransformation; Flame retardants; MeO-BDE; Natural products; OH-BDE; Review,Aquatic environments; Biotransformation; Brominated compounds; Brominated diphenyl ethers; Chemicals of concern; Marine environment; Marine invertebrates; Marine organisms; MeO-BDE; Metabolic relationships; Natural compounds; Natural products; OH-BDE; Polybrominated diphenyl ethers; Primary sources; Ethers; Flame retardants; Marine biology; Polyacrylates; Toxicity; Organic pollutants; endocrine disruptor; estrogen; hydroxylated brominated diphenyl ether; liothyronine; methoxylated brominated diphenyl ether; organohalogen derivative; polybrominated diphenyl ether; testosterone; thyroid hormone receptor; thyroxine; unclassified drug; anthropogenic source; bioaccumulation; biotransformation; ecotoxicology; marine ecosystem; metabolism; PBDE; point source pollution; aquatic environment; article; bioaccumulation; biotransformation; debromination; ecotoxicology; environmental impact; hydroxylation; marine environment; marine species; methoxylation; microsome; nonhuman; steroidogenesis; toxicokinetics; wildlife; xenobiotic metabolism; Endocrine Disruptors; Endocrine System; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Flame Retardants; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Hydroxylation; Invertebrata,
Multivariate statistical techniques for the assessment of surface water quality at the mid-Black Sea coast of Turkey,"Akbal F., Gürel L., Bahadir T., Güler I., Bakan G., Büyükgüngör H.",2011,"Water, Air, and Soil Pollution","The aim of this study was to investigate the seasonal and spatial variations in surface water quality at the mid-Black Sea coast of Turkey. The samples were collected from ten monitoring stations including rivers and sea water during the years from 2007 to 2008. The samples were analyzed for 25 parameters: total carbon, total inorganic carbon, total organic carbon, chromium, cadmium, copper, lead, iron, nickel, manganese, phenol, surfactants, ammonium, nitrite and nitrate-nitrogen, total phosphorus, adsorbable organic halogen, sulfate, hardness, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, and salinity. Multivariate statistical techniques, cluster analysis (CA) and factor analysis/principal component analysis (FA/PCA), were applied to analyze the similarities among the sampling sites to identify the source apportionment of pollution parameters in surface waters. The results indicate that seven factors for river water explained 82.24% of the variance. In seawater, seven factors account for 89.65% of the total variance. Varifactors obtained from factor analysis indicate that the parameters responsible for water quality variations are mainly related to organic pollution (municipal effluents), inorganic pollution (industrial effluents and waste disposal areas), nutrients (agricultural runoff), and dissolved salts (soil leaching and runoff process). © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Black sea; Heavy metals; Multivariate analysis; Nutrients; Physico-chemical parameters; Pollution; Surface water quality,Adsorbable organic halogens; Black sea; Component analysis; Dissolved salt; Electrical conductivity; Factor analysis; Industrial effluent; Monitoring stations; Multivariate analysis; Multivariate statistical techniques; Municipal effluents; Nitrate nitrogen; Organic pollution; Physicochemical parameters; Quality variation; River water; Sampling site; Soil leaching; Source apportionment; Spatial variations; Total carbon; Total dissolved solids; Total inorganic carbon; Total Organic Carbon; Total phosphorus; Total variance; Agricultural runoff; Ammonium compounds; Biochemical oxygen demand; Cadmium; Chromium; Cluster analysis; Dissolution; Dissolved oxygen; Effluents; Electric conductivity of solids; Heavy water; Industrial waste disposal; Leaching; Manganese; Metal analysis; Multivariant analysis; Natural language processing systems; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Phenols; Phosphorus; Sampling; Seawater; Sewage; Surface active agents; Water pollution; Water pollution control; Water quality; Surface waters; ammonia; cadmium; carbon; chromium; copper; dissolved oxygen; inorganic compound; iron; lead; manganese; nickel; nitrate; nitrite; nitrogen; organic carbon; organohalogen derivative; phenol; phosphorus; river water; sea water; sodium chloride; sulfate; surfactant; heavy metal; multivariate analysis; physicochemical property; seasonal variation; spatial variation; surface water; water pollution; water quality; agricultural waste; article; cluster analysis; controlled study; effluent; electric conductivity; factorial analysis; industrial waste; leaching; multivariate analysis; municipal solid waste; pH; pollution monitoring; principal component analysis; salinity; seashore; seasonal variation; surface water hydrology; Turkey (republic); waste disposal; water analysis; water hardness; water quality; water sampling; water structure; water temperature; Black Sea Coast [Turkey]; Turkey,
Meta-analysis of short-term and long-term survival following repair versus replacement for ischemic mitral regurgitation,"Vassileva C.M., Boley T., Markwell S., Hazelrigg S.",2011,European Journal of Cardio-thoracic Surgery,"The optimal surgical strategy for the management of ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is still debated. The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis summarizing the evidence favoring one technique over another (repair vs replacement). A search of the English literature in PubMed was performed using 'ischemic mitral regurgitation' and 'repair or replacement or annuloplasty' in the title/abstract field. Articles were excluded if they lacked a direct comparison of repair versus replacement, or used Teflon/pericardial strip or suture annuloplasty in >10% of the repairs. Nine articles were selected for the final analysis. All studies except one were relatively recent (2004-2009). The patient characteristics between treatment groups were similar across studies. All studies excluded patients with degenerative etiology and used a rigorous definition of IMR. Most patients had concomitant coronary artery bypass graft. In the patients with mitral valve replacement, at least the posterior and, in many cases, the entire subvalvular apparatus were preserved. Mean ejection fraction and proportion of patients with severe ventricular dysfunction were similar between the repair and replacement groups. The odds ratios for the studies, comparing replacement to repair, ranged from 0.884 to 17.241 for short-term mortality and the hazard ratios ranged from 0.677 to 3.205 for long-term mortality. There was a significantly increased likelihood of both short-term mortality (summary odds ratio 2.667 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.859-3.817)) and long-term mortality (summary hazard ratio 1.352 (95% CI 1.131-1.618)) for the replacement group compared to the repair group. Based on the meta-analysis of the current relevant literature, mitral valve repair for IMR is associated with better short-term and long-term survival compared to mitral valve replacement. Our conclusion should be interpreted in the context of the inherent limitations of a meta-analysis of retrospective studies including heterogeneity of patient characteristics, which may have influenced the physician's decision to perform mitral valve repair or replacement. In the absence of any published randomized studies, mitral procedure selection should be individualized. © 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.",Meta-analysis; Mitral valve; Regurgitation; Surgery; Survival,annuloplasty; coronary artery bypass graft; disease severity; heart ejection fraction; heart ventricle function; human; intermethod comparison; Medline; meta analysis; mitral valve regurgitation; mitral valve repair; mitral valve replacement; mortality; politef implant; priority journal; review; survival time; suturing method; systematic review; valvuloplasty; Aged; Female; Heart Valve Prosthesis; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mitral Valve; Mitral Valve Insufficiency; Myocardial Infarction; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome; Ventricular Function,

Hydrophobic textiles via bio-mimicking fabrication,"Yeung H.H., Chow M.C., Qian B., Xin J.H.",2011,Fiber Society Spring 2011 Conference,"Textile surfaces having high degree of water repellency or hydrophobicity are highly desirable for many applications. Currently, to achieve hydrophobicity, fluorochemicals are widely applied. Unfortunately, fluorochemicals are extremely persistent and bioaccumulative. Substances such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are found widely existed in the environment, in animals, and even in human blood, which causes great concerns to the public. Major fluorochemicals producers will also phase out some of the products in near future. Therefore, in order to produce 'green' and highly effective hydrophobic finishes for textiles, it becomes necessary to explore fluorochemical-free hydrophobic materials. On the other hand, commonly used fluorochemical-free hydrophobic materials such as silicones are significantly inferior to fluorochemicals in terms of degree of water repellency. In order to achieve superhydrophobic surfaces, researchers turned to structures, especially nano- and micro-structures, found in nature for inspiration. Those structures including lotus leaf, Lady's Mantle, and desert beetle, etc. This proceeding firstly provides a critical review of the current state-of-the-art nano- and micro-structure fabrication techniques, their theoretical backgrounds, their advantages and disadvantages. Following the previous work, new methods of achieving superhydrophobic surfaces are reported, including the building of waterdispersible nanocomposites that consist of a silica nanoparticle component and a silicone water repellent component, carbon nanotubes for building a superhydrophobic surface that can repel hot water, and nanosctructures bio-mimicking lotus leaf. These new methods can functionalize textiles and other substrates. While the surface roughness bio-mimick that of the lotus leaf provides nano- or micro-structure, the use of fluorochemicals and silicone component reduces the surface energy so that superior hydrophobicity can be achieved. Among the new methods reported, one is a nonfluorochemical based system and this system is reported in detail. The material synthesis was done through the use of a long-chain aliphatic silane in a transesterification with poly(ethylene glycol). This is followed by the addition of silica nanoparticles with different surface properties to form a nanocomposite sol. The water contact angles (WCA) from the surfaces and textile fabrics treated by the coating of the nanocomposite and its variations were measured, with some samples achieving a larger than 150° WCA. Surface morphology of the nanocomposite treated surface was also examined using SEM.",,Nanocomposites; Polyethylene glycols; Silicones; Sols; Surface properties; Surface roughness; Textile industry; Textiles; Fabrication technique; Hydrophobic Material; Material synthesis; Nano- and micro-structure; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Silica nanoparticles; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Water contact angle (WCA); Hydrophobicity,Hong Kong Polytechnic University
"""Clean nitrations using dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5)-A UK perspective"" [1]","Millar R.W., Colclough M.E., Arber A.W., Claridge R.P., Endsor R.M., Hamid J.",2011,"Energetic Materials: Chemistry, Hazards and Environmental Aspects","Dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) is a nitrating agent which is receiving increasing interest worldwide on account of the cleanliness of its nitration reactions and the potential of such reactions to offer environmentally-friendly processes for the manufacture of energetic materials-explosives and propellants. A review of this chemistry is timely, the subject having been comprehensively reviewed in 1997, and focuses on work carried out in the United Kingdom in furthering the exploitation of N2O5 nitrations. In particular, the following topics are covered: • N2O5 ring-opening nitrations (synthesis of di-/polynitrate esters and nitraminenitrates)-reviewed/updated • N2O5 selective nitrations (for energetic polymer precursor synthesis)-reviewed/updated • Other N2O5 nitrations (e.g. C-nitro compounds)-reviewed/updated • Nitrodesilylation reactions (synthesis of nitrate esters and nitramines) • Nitrations on solid supports using N2O5 (clays, zeolites and related materials) • Nitrations in alternative solvent systems using N2O5 (perfluorocarbons and perfluoroethers) • Regioselective nitration of toluene and clean nitration of dinitrotoluenes using N2O5 (for environmentally-friendly process for TNT manufacture) • Processes for the scale-up of N2O5 production and the economics of these processes. Some of the above processes are under consideration for the commercial manufacture of explosives, e.g. the toluene nitration processes would eliminate the production of redwater in the manufacture of TNT and are of interest to the US Department of Defense. Many of the other processes are of fundamental importance as they offer novel and clean routes either for the synthesis of the functionalities (C-nitro, nitrate ester, nitramine) which are incorporated into energetic materials, or in some cases actual energetic molecules themselves (e.g. hexanitrofluorene, diglycerol tetranitrate, ""Tris-X""-a polynitramine). An additional important product class is nitrate esters of strained-ring molecules (epoxides and oxetanes) for the synthesis of energetic polymer precursors (polyNIMMO and polyGlyN). The process economics for using N2O5 in scaled-up reactions are also discussed. This chapter is in the nature of a review of the use of N2O5 as an environmentallyfriendly nitrating agent and brings the coverage of this topic up to date. It should be of interest to workers in the field of energetic materials synthesis who require a timely survey of this topic. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

"Cadmium, manganese and lead distribution in the South China sea off the South Terengganu coast, Malaysia during post-monsoon and pre-monsoon","Adiana G., Shazili N.A.M., Ariffin M.M.",2011,Journal of Sustainability Science and Management,"Concentrations of cadmium, manganese and lead were determined in the water column of the South China Sea off the South Terengganu coast in May 2007 and September 2007. Seawater samples were collected from the surface, middle and bottom layers, in a grid of 18 stations 25 km apart. The dissolved metals were extracted on-board ship and preconcentrated on-line using Chelex-100 packed in Teflon tubing after filtration of seawater. The particulate metals were digested under microwave heating. Trace metals were analysed using ICP-MS and validated against CASS-4 and MESS-3. The concentration of dissolved and particulate metals were in the range of 0.002-0.194 μg/L and 45-249 μg/g for Cd, 0.04-2.71 μg/L and 21-2885 μg/g for Mn and 0.03-0.49 μg/L and 10-4277 μg/g for Pb respectively. All metals were dominantly in the dissolved phase except Cd which was predominantly in the particulate phase during September 2007. The order of mean log K D found was Cd&gt;Pb&gt;Mn. Positive correlation of log K D with suspended particulate matter were found during both sampling periods except during September 2007, Cd was negatively correlated with suspended particulate matter. The present measurements were to provide baseline data for any future comparison of trace metals distribution in the South China Sea off Southern Terengganu coast. © Universiti Malaysia Terengganu Publisher.",Chelex-100; Dissolved metals; Particulate metals; South China sea,,Universiti Malaysia Terengganu
Cation exchange membranes for fuel cells- a patent review,"Zhang Z., Xu T.",2011,Recent Patents on Chemical Engineering,"Ion exchange membranes-based technology, as a non-hazardous technology in nature, is extending towards the newly emerging fuel cells beyond its successful application in various industrial processes, e.g. electrolysis, electrodialysis, diffusion dialysis, etc. Ever since the famous DuPont product Nafion®, a large number of cation exchange membranes for fuel cells application (known as proton exchange membranes) have been prepared to make fuel cells reliable, durable and feasible. Since most of commercial products originate directly from patents, it is of great importance, at the time when proton exchange membrane fuel cells are on the brink of commercialization, to make a special review focusing on proton exchange membranes reported in patents. To get a better understanding of the state of the art of proton exchange membranes from a viewpoint of patents, most relevant patents during the last decade are surveyed in this review and some critical comments on the tendency and prospect of proton exchange membranes are made. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers.",Cation exchange membranes; Fuel cells; Inorganic-backbone polymers; Perfluorosulfonic acid membrane; Proton exchange membranes; Sulfonated aromatic polymers,Aromatic polymers; Dialysis membranes; Fuel cells; Gas fuel purification; Ion exchange; Ion exchange membranes; Membrane technology; Membranes; Patents and inventions; Positive ions; Backbone polymer; Cation exchange membranes; Perfluorosulfonic acid membranes; Proton exchange membranes; Sulfonated aromatic polymers; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC),Bentham Science Publishers B.V.
Alkane degradation under anoxic conditions by a nitrate-reducing bacterium with possible involvement of the electron acceptor in substrate activation,"Zedelius J., Rabus R., Grundmann O., Werner I., Brodkorb D., Schreiber F., Ehrenreich P., Behrends A., Wilkes H., Kube M., Reinhardt R., Widdel F.",2011,Environmental Microbiology Reports,"Microorganisms can degrade saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes) not only under oxic but also under anoxic conditions. Three denitrifying isolates (strains HxN1, OcN1, HdN1) able to grow under anoxic conditions by coupling alkane oxidation to CO2 with NO3 -reduction to N2 were compared with respect to their alkane metabolism. Strains HxN1 and OcN1, which are both Betaproteobacteria, utilized n-alkanes from C6 to C8 and C8 to C12 respectively. Both activate alkanes anaerobically in a fumarate-dependent reaction yielding alkylsuccinates, as suggested by present and previous metabolite and gene analyses. However, strain HdN1 was unique in several respects. It belongs to the Gammaproteobacteria and was more versatile towards alkanes, utilizing the range from C6 to C30. Neither analysis of metabolites nor analysis of genes in the complete genome sequence of strain HdN1 hinted at fumarate-dependent alkane activation. Moreover, whereas strains HxN1 and OcN1 grew with alkanes and NO3 -, NO2 - or N2O added to the medium, strain HdN1 oxidized alkanes only with NO3 - or NO2 -but not with added N2O; but N2O was readily used for growth with long-chain alcohols or fatty acids. Results suggest that NO2 - or a subsequently formed nitrogen compound other than N2O is needed for alkane activation in strain HdN1. From an energetic point of view, nitrogen-oxygen species are generally rather strong oxidants. They may enable enzymatic mechanisms that are not possible under conditions of sulfate reduction or methanogenesis and thus allow a special mode of alkane activation. © 2010 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,Bacteria (microorganisms); Betaproteobacteria; Gammaproteobacteria,Wiley-Blackwell
Meta-analysis of zooarchaeological data from SW Asia and SE Europe provides insight into the origins and spread of animal husbandry,"Conolly J., Colledge S., Dobney K., Vigne J.-D., Peters J., Stopp B., Manning K., Shennan S.",2011,Journal of Archaeological Science,"Identifying spatial and temporal variation in animal exploitation patterns is essential for building our understanding of the transition from hunting to stock-keeping. Quantitative analysis of the published records of over 400,000 animal bones recovered from 114 archaeological sites from SW Asia and SE Europe from c12 ka to c7.5 ka cal BP (thousands of calibrated radiocarbon years before present) demonstrates significant spatiotemporal variability in faunal exploitation patterns. Sites in the Euphrates region show adoption of domestic taxa by c10.5 ka cal BP, although on average these taxa contribute less than 10% to total assemblage size. This rises to a median of about 40% by c9.5 ka cal BP, and then to about 45% of total NISP by c8.5 ka cal BP. By c10.5 ka in the Tigris and Zagros region domesticates contribute less than 5% to faunal assemblages, but then rise to a median of about 20% by c9.5 ka and 40% by c8.4 ka cal BP. In contrast, Levantine sites have low numbers of domestic taxa (<1%) until c8.8 ka cal BP, when the proportion dramatically increases to a median of about 35%. This apparent delayed-adoption pattern also holds true for the southern Levant, which shows, on average, low levels (<1%) of domestic taxa until 8.8 ka cal BP, at which point domesticates contribute a median of about 10% to assemblages. In the northern parts of SW Asia, the mid- to late-10th millennium cal BP is pivotal, as proportions of domestic taxa show a dramatic increase in frequency during this time, and the 'package' of domestic sheep, goat, cattle and pig becomes more firmly established. This sets the trend for sites of the 9th millennium and the appearance of Neolithic communities in SE Europe from the 8th millennium cal BP onwards, from which point domestic animals are ubiquitous in faunal assemblages. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Domestication; Livestock; Zooarchaeology,animal husbandry; archaeological evidence; archaeology; domestication; livestock; Neolithic; spatiotemporal analysis; Asia; Europe; Animalia; Bos; Capra hircus; Ovis aries; Suidae,Academic Press
Pancreatic β-cell KATP channels: Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia,"Bennett K., James C., Hussain K.",2010,Reviews in Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders,"The pancreatic β-cell ATP-sensitive K+ channel (K ATP channel) plays a critical role in glucose homeostasis by linking glucose metabolism to electrical excitability and insulin secretion. Changes in the intracellular ratio of ATP/ADP mediate the metabolic regulation of channel activity. The β-cell KATP channel is a hetero-octameric complex composed of two types of subunits: four inward-rectifying potassium channel pore-forming (Kir6.2) subunits and four high-affinity sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunits. Kir6.2 and SUR1 are encoded by the genes KCNJ11 and ABCC8, respectively. Mutations in these genes can result in congenital hyperinsulinism and permanent neonatal diabetes.

Detection of metal ions based on conjugated fluorescent polymers,"Likun M., Xingfen L., Quli F., Wei H.",2010,Progress in Chemistry,"conjugated fluorescent polymers (CPs) such as polyacetylene, polyfluorene, polythiophene and polyphenylene derivatives have unique optical properties, self-assembly performance and regulable structure and properties. They have been used asexcellent optical sensing materials to develop high sensitive and selective sensors by utilizing the large extinction coefficient and high flurescence quantum yield of conjugated polymers, which have been a research hot spot in the field of biosensors. Detection of metal ions based on the conjugated polymer primarily relies on the non- water-soluble conjugated polymers. Metal ions can be detected by investigating the changes of the optical characteristics of the polymers induced by the combination of metal ions with some units such as bipyridyl and crown ethers on the polymer chains. Water solubility ofconjugated polymers can be improved by appending hydrophilic side chains on the main chain of polymer, which provide many new ideas for the design of metal ions biosensors. For example, some biomolecules such as DNA and glucopyranose can be used to design schemes in order to improve the sensitivity and selectivity for the detection of metal ions. This review summarizes the recent progress of highly sensitive detection of heavy metal ions (Hg 2+,Pb2+), transition-metal ions (Cu2+, Ni 2+, Fe3+, Ru3+, Ag+), rare earth element ion (Eu3+), and alkali metal ions (K+, Na +, Li+) based on non-water-soluble and water-soluble conjugated fluorescent polymers.

Lead and PCBs as risk factors for attention defcit/hyperactivity disorder,"Eubig P.A., Aguiar A., Schantz S.L.",2010,Environmental Health Perspectives,"Objectives: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most frequently diagnosed neurobehavioral disorder of childhood, yet its etiology is not well understood. In this review we present evidence that environmental chemicals, particularly polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and lead, are associated with defcits in many neurobehavioral functions that are also impaired in ADHD. Datas Ources: Human and animal studies of developmental PCB or lead exposures that assessed specifc functional domains shown to be impaired in ADHD children were identifed via searches of PubMed using ""lead"" or ""PCB exposure"" in combination with key words, including ""attention,"" ""working memory,"" ""response inhibition,"" ""executive function,"" ""cognitive function,"" ""behavior,"" and ""ADHD."" Datasynthesis: Children and laboratory animals exposed to lead or PCBs show defcits in many aspects of attention and executive function that have been shown to be impaired in children diagnosed with ADHD, including tests of working memory, response inhibition, vigilance, and alertness. Studies conducted to date suggest that lead may reduce both attention and response inhibition, whereas PCBs may impair response inhibition to a greater degree than attention. Low-level lead exposure has been associated with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD in several recent studies. Similar studies of PCBs have not been conducted.

Xenogenic extracellular matrices as potential biomaterials for interposition grafting in urological surgery,"Davis N.F., McGuire B.B., Callanan A., Flood H.D., McGloughlin T.M.",2010,Journal of Urology,"Purpose The field of tissue engineering focuses on developing strategies for reconstructing injured, diseased, and congenitally absent tissues and organs. During the last decade urologists have benefited from remodeling and regenerative properties of bioscaffolds derived from xenogenic extracellular matrices. We comprehensively reviewed the current literature on structural and functional characteristics of xenogenic extracellular matrix grafting since it was first described in urological surgery. We also reviewed the clinical limitations, and assessed the potential for safe and effective urological application of extracellular matrix grafting in place of autogenous tissue. Materials and Methods We performed literature searches for English language publications using the PubMed® and MEDLINE® databases. Keywords included ""xenogenic,"" ""extracellular matrix"" and ""genitourinary tract applications."" A total of 112 articles were scrutinized, of which 50 were suitable for review based on clinical relevance and importance of content. Results Since the mid 1990s xenogenic extracellular matrices have been used to successfully treat a number of pathological conditions that affect the upper and lower genitourinary tract. They are typically prepared from porcine organs such as small intestine and bladder. These organs are harvested and subjected to decellularization and sterilization techniques before surgical implantation. Bioinductive growth factors that are retained during the preparation process induce constructive tissue remodeling as the extracellular matrix is simultaneously degraded and excreted. However, recent documented concerns over durability, decreased mechanical strength and residual porcine DNA after preparation techniques have temporarily hampered the potential of extracellular matrices as a reliable replacement for genitourinary tract structures. Conclusions Extracellular matrices are a useful alternative for successfully treating a number of urological conditions that affect the genitourinary tract. However, clinical concerns regarding mechanical limitations and biosafety need to be addressed before their long-term role in reconstructive urological surgery can be clearly established. © 2010 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.",Extracellular matrix; Intestine small; Reconstructive surgical procedures; Tissue engineering; Urinary bladder,basic fibroblast growth factor; biomaterial; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; interleukin 6; lymphotoxin; politef; tachocomb; vascular endothelial growth inhibitor; biomechanics; bladder; cytokine production; extracellular matrix; human; humoral immunity; immune response; kidney; nonhuman; priority journal; review; stress incontinence; suburethral sling; tissue engineering; tissue graft; ureter; urine incontinence; urogenital tract disease; urologic surgery; xenograft; Animals; Biocompatible Materials; Biomechanics; Extracellular Matrix; Humans; Tissue Engineering; Urologic Diseases; Urologic Surgical Procedures,
Pharmaceuticals and personal care products in U.S. biosolids,"McClellan K., Halden R.U.",2010,ACS Symposium Series,"Since the 1988 U.S. ban on ocean dumping of sewage sludge, the majority of these materials are disposed of on land as biosolids. To provide fundamental data for risk assessment concerning the environment, crop plants, and humans, several studies have been conducted that aimed at quantifying the load of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as well as other emerging pollutants of concern in biosolids. So far, two large studies exist that analyzed biosolids samples representing the whole U.S. Both sample sets were collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and analyzed by the same contract laboratory that developed the EPA method 1694 for analysis of PPCPs in biosolids and other matrices. The samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and quantified using isotope dilution as well as conventional use of internal and external standards. The present meta analysis scrutinizes the findings and approaches of the two studies and puts them in context to potential environmental risks that should be considered. Both the EPA's Targeted National Sewage Sludge Survey (TNSSS) and the analysis of a comparable sample set collected in 2001 revealed concentrations of several antimicrobials and antibiotics in the mg kg-1 dry weight range. Prevalent contaminants were triclocarban, triclosan, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, followed by a number of tetracycline antibiotics. A comparison of the two datasets and study designs showed that combining a large number of individual samples to mega-composite samples is a suitable approach for identifying prevalent contaminants and for obtaining representative mean concentrations. Whereas the use of mega composite samples can result in significant time and cost savings, this study design strategy tends to yield lower numbers of total analytes detected, lower detection frequencies for individual analytes and it limits the detection of spatial (geographical) patterns in analyte occurrence. The findings of both nationwide studies provide a critical data basis for future risk assessment concerning the safety of biosolids application on agricultural and recreational land. Risks of primary concern identified in this work are the promotion of antibiotic resistance in the environment, adverse effects on soil microbial communities and plants, as well as the possibility of direct exposure of consumers to antibiotic residues contained in food crops grown on biosolids amended fields.. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,Antibiotics; Biological materials; Crops; Environmental Protection Agency; Isotopes; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Risk assessment; Sampling; Sewage sludge; Antibiotic residues; Antibiotic resistance; Contract laboratories; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Pharmaceuticals and personal care products; Soil microbial community; Tetracycline antibiotics; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Biosolids,American Chemical Society
"Microbial biodegradation of a novel fluorotelomer alcohol, 1H,1H,2H,2H,8H,8H-perfluorododecanol, yields short fluorinated acids","Arakaki A., Ishii Y., Tokuhisa T., Murata S., Sato K., Sonoi T., Tatsu H., Matsunaga T.",2010,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,"The accumulation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been detected in wildlife, soil, and water. Further, 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (8:2 FTOH) is used for the industrial synthesis of other fluorotelomer compounds, surfactants, and polymeric materials; however, it was recently found to be a potential source of PFOA contamination in the environment. 1H,1H,2H,2H,8H,8H-perfluorododecanol (degradable telomer fluoroalcohol (DTFA)), which is a newly developed fluorotelomer, contains the -CH2- group in the fluorinated carbon backbone, making it potentially degradable through biological reactions. In this study, we investigated the biodegradation of DTFA in a mixed bacterial culture obtained from activated sludge. Optimized quantitative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the predicted metabolites generated in the culture revealed accumulations of the transformation products from DTFA to 2H,2H,8H,8H-PFDoA and 2H,8H,8H-2-PFUDoA via multiple processes. Furthermore, the production of short fluorinated compounds, perfluorobutanoic acid, perfluoropentanoic acid, and perfluoropentanedioic acid, which are believed to have lower accumulation potential and toxicity toward organisms than PFOA, was determined. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Biodegradation; Fluorotelomer alcohol; Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,"Activated sludge; Biological reaction; Carbon backbone; Fluorinated acids; Fluorinated compound; Fluoroalcohol; Fluorotelomer alcohols; Industrial synthesis; Liquid chromatography-Mass spectrometry; Microbial biodegradation; Mixed bacterial culture; Multiple process; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Polymeric material; Potential sources; Transformation products; Acids; Chromatography; Degradation; High pressure liquid chromatography; Liquids; Mass spectrometry; Microbiology; Organic polymers; Surface active agents; Biodegradation; 1h,1h,2h,2h,8h,8h perfluorododecanol; 2h,2h,8h,8h perfluorododecanoic acid; 2h,8h,8h 2 perfluorododecenoic acid; perfluoro compound; perfluorobutanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoropentanedioic acid; perfluoropentanoic acid; unclassified drug; activated sludge; alcohol; bacterium; biodegradation; halogenated hydrocarbon; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; microbial activity; organic acid; polymer; surfactant; activated sludge; airflow; article; bacterium culture; biodegradation; biotransformation; chemical structure; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; quantitative analysis; Acids; Biodegradation, Environmental; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Chromatography, Liquid; Dodecanol; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Halogenation; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Industrial Waste; Mass Spectrometry; Octanoic Acids; Sewage; Soil Pollutants; Bacteria (microorganisms)",
Anterior knee pain in younger adults as a precursor to subsequent patellofemoral osteoarthritis: A systematic review,"Thomas M.J., Wood L., Selfe J., Peat G.",2010,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders,"Abstract. Background. Patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) is a common form of knee OA in middle and older age, but its relation to PF disorders and symptoms earlier in life is unclear. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review to investigate the strength of evidence for an association between anterior knee pain (AKP) in younger adults and subsequent PFOA. Methods. The search strategy included electronic databases (Pubmed, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane, PEDro, SportDiscus: inception to December 2009), reference lists of potentially eligible studies and selected reviews. Full text articles in any language, - identified via English titles and abstracts, were included if they were retrospective or prospective in design and contained quantitative data regarding structural changes indicative of PFOA, incident to original idiopathic AKP. Eligibility criteria were applied to titles, abstracts and full-texts by two independent reviewers. Data extraction included study location, design, date, sampling procedure, sample characteristics, AKP/PFOA definitions, follow-up duration and rate, and main findings. Foreign language articles were translated into English prior to examination. Results. Seven articles satisfied eligibility (5 English, 2 German). Only one case-control study directly investigated a link between PFOA and prior AKP, providing level 3b evidence in favour of an association (OR 4.4; 95%CI 1.8, 10.6). Rough estimates of the annual risk of PFOA from the remaining six small, uncontrolled, observational studies (mean follow-up range: 5.7 to 23 years) ranged from 0% to 3.4%. This was not the primary aim of these studies, and limitations in design and methodology mean this data should be interpreted with caution. Conclusions. There is a paucity of high-quality evidence reporting a link between AKP and PFOA. Further, well-designed cohort studies may be able to fill this evidence gap. © 2010 Thomas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"adult; article; CINAHL; Cochrane Library; data base; data extraction; disease association; EMBASE; follow up; human; knee pain; MEDLINE; osteoarthritis; patellofemoral joint; patellofemoral osteoarthritis; quantitative study; sampling; systematic review; comorbidity; knee; knee osteoarthritis; patella ligament; patellofemoral pain syndrome; pathophysiology; review; Adult; Comorbidity; Humans; Knee Joint; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Patellar Ligament; Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome; Young Adult",
Global regulation of gene expression in response to cysteine availability in Clostridium perfringens,"André G., Haudecoeur E., Monot M., Ohtani K., Shimizu T., Dupuy B., Martin-Verstraete I.",2010,BMC Microbiology,"Abstract. Background. Cysteine has a crucial role in cellular physiology and its synthesis is tightly controlled due to its reactivity. However, little is known about the sulfur metabolism and its regulation in clostridia compared with other firmicutes. In Clostridium perfringens, the two-component system, VirR/VirS, controls the expression of the ubiG operon involved in methionine to cysteine conversion in addition to the expression of several toxin genes. The existence of links between the C. perfringens virulence regulon and sulfur metabolism prompted us to analyze this metabolism in more detail. Results. We first performed a tentative reconstruction of sulfur metabolism in C. perfringens and correlated these data with the growth of strain 13 in the presence of various sulfur sources. Surprisingly, C. perfringens can convert cysteine to methionine by an atypical still uncharacterized pathway. We further compared the expression profiles of strain 13 after growth in the presence of cystine or homocysteine that corresponds to conditions of cysteine depletion. Among the 177 genes differentially expressed, we found genes involved in sulfur metabolism and controlled by premature termination of transcription via a cysteine specific T-box system (cysK-cysE, cysP1 and cysP2) or an S-box riboswitch (metK and metT). We also showed that the ubiG operon was submitted to a triple regulation by cysteine availability via a T-box system, by the VirR/VirS system via the VR-RNA and by the VirX regulatory RNA. In addition, we found that expression of pfoA (theta-toxin), nagL (one of the five genes encoding hyaluronidases) and genes involved in the maintenance of cell redox status was differentially expressed in response to cysteine availability. Finally, we showed that the expression of genes involved in [Fe-S] clusters biogenesis and of the ldh gene encoding the lactate dehydrogenase was induced during cysteine limitation. Conclusion. Several key functions for the cellular physiology of this anaerobic bacterium were controlled in response to cysteine availability. While most of the genes involved in sulfur metabolism are regulated by premature termination of transcription, other still uncharacterized mechanisms of regulation participated in the induction of gene expression during cysteine starvation. © 2010 André et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"bacterial protein; bacterial toxin; cysE protein; cysK protein; cysP1 protein; cysP2 protein; cysteine; homocysteine; hyaluronidase; lactate dehydrogenase; methionine; metK protein; metT protein; nagL protein; pfoA protein; sulfur; T box transcription factor; theta toxin; unclassified drug; bacterial protein; cysteine; sulfur; article; bacterial gene; bacterial growth; bacterial metabolism; bacterial strain; biogenesis; cell function; Clostridium perfringens; controlled study; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene induction; nonhuman; operon; oxidation reduction reaction; protein depletion; regulatory RNA sequence; regulon; riboswitch; signal transduction; transcription termination; amino acid sequence; chemistry; genetics; metabolism; molecular genetics; sequence alignment; Bacteria (microorganisms); Clostridia; Clostridium perfringens; Firmicutes; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacterial Proteins; Clostridium perfringens; Cysteine; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Molecular Sequence Data; Sequence Alignment; Sulfur",
Preparation and surface properties of fluorinated acrylates copolymers,"Wang L., Yuan Q.-L., Wu S.-S.",2010,"Journal of Macromolecular Science, Part B: Physics","Copolymerization of acrylates and styrene (St) with perfluorooctylacyloxyethyl methacrylate (FA) monomer, prepared from the reaction of perfluorooctanoic acid and hydroxymethyl methacrylate, was carried out by solution polymerization. The fluorinated acrylate and St copolymers (PFA) were examined by GPC, FT-IR, and 1H NMR. The surface tension of the PFA solution in N-methyl pyrrolidone was tested by the drop volume method. The results showed that the surface tension of the PFA solution decreased in exponential decay with increase of the PFA concentration, and the surface tension of the solution also decreased with increased addition of the FA monomer in the copolymer at the same concentration. Meanwhile, the adsorption of the PFA macromolecules in the air-solution interface increased and enrichment of the fluorinated segments on the solution surface occurred. The studies of the surface free energy, polarity, fluorine content, and morphology of the PFA films illustrated that the surface free energy and polarity of the PFA films were decreased with the augment of the FA monomer in the copolymers, and that the fluorine content and the surface roughness were increased. The surface free energy of the PFA film was as small as 16.6 mN·m-1. The surface properties of the PFA copolymers obtained by one shot feed during polymerization were superior to those obtained by continuing feed procedure. More fluorine segregation occurred and induced the formation of a fluorine-enriched surface if the PFA copolymer was postheated.

"A systematic review of randomized controlled trials exploring the effect of immunomodulative interventions on infection, organ failure, and mortality in trauma patients","Spruijt N.E., Visser T., Leenen L.P.H.",2010,Critical Care,"Introduction: Following trauma, patients may suffer an overwhelming pro-inflammatory response and immune paralysis resulting in infection and multiple organ failure (MOF). Various potentially immunomodulative interventions have been tested. The objective of this study is to systematically review the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigate the effect of potentially immunomodulative interventions in comparison to a placebo or standard therapy on infection, MOF, and mortality in trauma patients.Methods: A computerized search of MEDLINE, the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE yielded 502 studies, of which 18 unique RCTs were deemed relevant for this study. The methodological quality of these RCTs was assessed using a critical appraisal checklist for therapy articles from the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine. The effects of the test interventions on infection, MOF, and mortality rates and inflammatory parameters relative to the controls were recorded.Results: In most studies, the inflammatory parameters differed significantly between the test and control groups. However, significant changes in infection, MOF, and mortality rates were only measured in studies testing immunoglobulin, IFN-γ, and glucan.Conclusions: Based on level 1b and 2b studies, administration of immunoglobulin, IFN-γ, or glucan have shown the most promising results to improve the outcome of trauma patients. © 2010 Spruijt et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,albumin; antithrombin III; aselizumab; dextran; glucan; immunoglobulin; monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody CD18; perfluorooctyl bromide; placebo; prostaglandin E1; recombinant antibody; recombinant gamma interferon; Ringer lactate solution; sodium chloride; sucrose; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; gamma interferon; glucan; immunoglobulin; immunologic factor; adolescent; adult; aged; article; clinical effectiveness; cytokine response; drug effect; hospital patient; human; immunomodulation; infection; injury; major clinical study; meta analysis; mortality; multiple organ failure; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review; treatment outcome; immunology; infection; infection control; injury; methodology; mortality; multiple organ failure; review; Glucans; Humans; Immunoglobulins; Immunologic Factors; Infection; Infection Control; Interferon-gamma; Multiple Organ Failure; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome; Wounds and Injuries,
Current treatment strategies for brain metastasis and complications from therapeutic techniques: A review of current literature,"Platta C.S., Khuntia D., Mehta M.P., Suh J.H.",2010,American Journal of Clinical Oncology: Cancer Clinical Trials,"Abstract: Each year approximately 170,000 patients are diagnosed with brain metastasis in the United States, making this the most common intracranial tumor in adults. Historically, treatment strategies focused on the use of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for palliation, yielding a median survival time of only 3 to 6 months. The possible effect of WBRT on cognitive function has generated much concern and debate regarding the use of this modality. Thus, the use of WBRT alone, or in conjunction with other treatment modalities should take into account both risks and benefits, to ensure the best patient outcome with regard to disease state and functional status. The advent of technologies permitting local dose-escalation have clearly increased local control rates, and in select patients, even survival, thereby, further intensifying the debate regarding the use of WBRT. Here, we review the use of WBRT, radiosurgery, and resection for the treatment of brain metastases. Further, we will review the use of radiation sensitizers and blood- brain barrier penetrating cytotoxics such as temozolomide. Finally, we will discuss current treatment strategies for possibly maintaining and improving cognitive function for these patients. © 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Brain tumors; Efaproxiral (RSR-13); Motexafin gadolinium; Radiation therapy; Radiosensitizer; Stereotactic radiosurgery; Temozolomide; WBRT,anticonvulsive agent; broxuridine; corticosteroid; cytotoxic agent; donepezil; efaproxiral; erlotinib; fluosol; gadolinium texaphyrin; irinotecan; lapatinib; lonidamine; melatonin; memantine; metronidazole; misonidazole; navelbine; perfluoro compound; radiosensitizing agent; temozolomide; thalidomide; topotecan; trastuzumab; valproic acid; dacarbazine; drug derivative; temozolomide; blood brain barrier; brain edema; brain metastasis; breast cancer; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; clinical trial; cognition; cognitive defect; human; medical literature; melanoma; review; seizure; skull irradiation; whole brain radiation therapy; brain; brain tumor; drug effect; metastasis; methodology; mortality; prognosis; radiation exposure; radiosurgery; survival rate; time; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; Cognition; Dacarbazine; Humans; Neoplasm Metastasis; Prognosis; Radiation-Sensitizing Agents; Radiosurgery; Survival Rate; Time Factors,
"Alcohol, drugs, caffeine, tobacco, and environmental contaminant exposure: Reproductive health consequences and clinical implications","Sadeu J.C., Hughes C.L., Agarwal S., Foster W.G.",2010,Critical Reviews in Toxicology,"Reproductive function and fertility are thought to be compromised by behaviors such as cigarette smoking, substance abuse, and alcohol consumption; however, the strength of these associations are uncertain. Furthermore, the reproductive system is thought to be under attack from exposure to environmental contaminants, particularly those chemicals shown to affect endocrine homeostasis. The relationship between exposure to environmental contaminants and adverse effects on human reproductive health are frequently debated in the scientific literature and these controversies have spread into the lay press drawing increased public and regulatory attention. Therefore, the objective of the present review was to critically evaluate the literature concerning the relationship between lifestyle exposures and adverse effects on fertility as well as examining the evidence for a role of environmental contaminants in the purported decline of semen quality and the pathophysiology of subfertility, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and endometriosis. The authors conclude that whereas cigarette smoking is strongly associated with adverse reproductive outcomes, high-level exposures to other lifestyle factors are only weakly linked with negative fertility impacts. Finally, there is no compelling evidence that environmental contaminants, at concentrations representative of the levels measured in contemporary biomonitoring studies, have any effect, positive or negative, on reproductive health in the general population. Further research using prospective study designs with robust sample sizes are needed to evaluate testable hypotheses that address the relationship between exposure and adverse reproductive health effects. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.",Alcohol; environmental contaminants; fertility; reproductive; tobacco; toxicity,"4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; alcohol; amphetamine; caffeine; cannabis; catecholamine; chlordiazepoxide; cocaine; diamorphine; estradiol; follitropin; luteinizing hormone; narcotic agent; nicotine; opiate; perfluoro compound; phencyclidine; phthalic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; prolactin; sex hormone binding globulin; testosterone; tetrahydrocannabinol; alcohol consumption; alcohol intoxication; alcoholism; biological monitoring; catecholamine release; cigarette smoking; endometriosis; environmental exposure; estradiol blood level; estrus cycle; feminization; fertility; follitropin blood level; health care access; hormone inhibition; human; lifestyle; low birth weight; male fertility; male infertility; nonhuman; nutritional deficiency; ovary insufficiency; ovary polycystic disease; pathophysiology; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prolactin blood level; protein blood level; reproduction; reproductive health; review; sample size; semen analysis; smoking habit; sperm; spontaneous abortion; subfertility; substance abuse; teratology; testis weight; testosterone blood level; tobacco; Alcohol Drinking; Caffeine; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Marijuana Smoking; Reproduction; Risk Factors; Substance-Related Disorders; Tobacco; Nicotiana tabacum",
Assessment of heavy metal pollution in Bamdedj marsh sediment (Khuzestan province) by Muller's geochemical index,"Karbassi A.R., Valavi Sh.",2010,Journal of Environmental Studies,"Just as the world we inherited today, is what our past generation left on us, the future generations would inherit the legacy we leave for them. Water is essential for life on earth. Water is a unique liquid, without it, life as we know is impossible. Water the ""Elixir of Life"" is facing a severe threat due to pollution. Water, due to its great solvent power, is constantly threatened to get polluted easily. The requirement of water in all forms of lives, from micro-organisms to man, is a serious problem today because all water resources have been reached to a point of crisis due to unplanned urbanization and industrialization. The topic of our concern here is pollution of wetland. Heavy metals constitute an important group of environmentally hazardous substances. During this century, many wetlands in Iran have received elevated inputs of heavy metals as a result of an increase in various activities. Municipal and industrial discharges, urban storm-water runoff, and agricultural drainage can result in trace metals, nutrients, pesticides, and organic wastes being transported into aquatic ecosystems. In aquatic ecosystems, contaminants are often rapidly removed from the water column via sorption processes. Given that trace metals are not subjected to degradation processes, they tend to accumulate in benthic sediments. However, trace metals are not necessarily fixed permanently to sediments; rather they may be remobilized via chemical, physical, and biological processes. The pollution of aquatic ecosystems by trace metals is a significant problem as trace metals constitute some of the most hazardous substances that can bio-accumulate. Metals that are deposited in the aquatic environment may accumulate in the food chain and cause ecological damage while also posing a risk to human health. Human activities have lead to accumulation of toxic metals in the aquatic sediments. Sediments and suspended particulate matters (SPM) of aquatic environment have an important role in adsorption of dissolved heavy metals, although they can be a potential source of metal pollution by releasing adsorbed metals during changing physical-chemical characteristics of the aquatic environment. Since concentrations of most heavy metals in river waters are very low and subject to highly variations during a year, sediments and SPM are good indicators of metal pollution in the river environment. In the recent year more attention has been paid to the aquatic environment. These environments are being polluted by various sources including sewages from residential, agricultural and industrial sectors. Sediments of aquatic environment act as a major reservoir of metals and also as a source of contaminants. Enrichment of heavy metals due to industrialization and urbanization was recorded in sediments of coastal seas all over the world. The monitoring of metal contents from anthropogenic activities is particularly important for the assessment of environmental quality and protection. Metal distributions in lagoon and intertidal sediments have frequently been used to investigate chronological inputs and spatial distribution of contaminants. Enrichment of heavy metals, radio nuclides and radioactive pollutants is recorded in sediments of coastal areas like Bombay, Goa and Cochin because of industrialization. In view of this, the present study is taken up to estimate the metal concentrations in the Bamdedj wetland. The present study deals with the spatial and temporal variations of trace metal contents, their controlling factors and an assessment of the pollution levels in the surficial sediments. The study focuses to test the hypothesis that concentrations of metals subject to anthropogenic inputs would increase in recent sediments as urbanization of the watershed continued to increase. As is well known, elements can be divided into two categories based on their biological roles, i.e. essential (or biophilous), and non-essential. The first type of elements includes a large group of metals (such as Co, Cr, Cu, Zn, etc.) which are functionally necessary for living organisms in small concentrations; however, at high levels they become toxic by interfering with necessary biochemical functions. The non-essential category of elements includes chalcophile elements such as Pb, Cd, Hg and As, which are extremely toxic and represent a serious danger to living organisms. Subsequently amongst organic and inorganic pollutants, most of the research prefers to study the inorganic pollutants due to the ease of measurements. In the present study we have tried to measure heavy metals such as Ni, Cd, Pb, Zn, As and Hg along with Ca and Fe. For these purpose the six sediment samples were collected from Bamdedj marsh in the province of Khuzestan. Most trace metals tend to enrich in the modern organic sediments rather than inorganic sediments. Chemical bonds of metals in sediments and SPM is an important factor in detecting pollution in the particulate phase of the river. Many sequential extraction and chemical partitioning methods have been developed and applied for determination of metal bonding and pollution detection in particulate phase. It is believed that metals in adsorbed, carbonate, sulfide and organic bonds are more related to pollution and have higher risk of bioavailability and contamination of the environment. The marsh sediments, which were brown to black in color, were air-dried and passed through a 63-um mesh (equivalent to a No. 230 sieve, ASTM E-11). The sieved sediment was powdered using an agate mortar and pestle. About 0.5 g of the powdered sample was placed in a Teflon beaker containing 10 mL aqua regia. The mixture was heated until most of the liquid had evaporated, and allowed to cool before 5 mL of hydrogen fluoride (HF) were added. The samples were further cooled to room temperature before being filtered. The filtrates were transferred to 50 mL volumetric flasks and brought to volume with 1 N HCl. Chemical partition studies were conducted in four sequential steps: (1) acetic acid 25%v/v, (2) acetic acid 25% v/v-0.1 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride, (3) 30% H202 ""extraction with 1 M ammonium acetate"" and (4) hot 50% HCl. Trace metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Ca, Fe and Al) were measured using a UNICAM flame atomic absorption spectrometer. Calibration curves were established using known standards. Procedural blanks and duplicates were run alongside the samples as part of the quality assurance program. The analytical accuracy was approximately ±3% for all elements. A standard sample (MESS-1) was analyzed using the same methods as an accuracy check. The Weighted Pair Group method (GWP) was used to identify clustering tendencies among the samples. To assess the intensity of metal contamination in Shur River sediments, the geochemical accumulation index was calculated using: I geo=Log2[Cn/Bn*1.5] Where Igeo is the geochemical accumulation index, Cn is the sediment metal concentration and Bn is the metal concentration in the shale The results of cluster analysis (Fig. 1) show that Hg and as are originated from organic sources as they form cluster ""D"" with LOI at a meaningful similarity coefficient. On the other hand one may conclude that Ni is mainly originated from lithogenic source since it forms cluster ""B"" with Fe at a significant similarity coefficient. It seems that Pb is mainly originated from biogenic source since it has developed a highly significant similarity coefficient with Ca in cluster ""A"". The source of Zn and Cd (cluster C) cannot be furnished through cluster analysis. The results of geochemical studies show various concentrations for studies metals. While using Igeo index, we noticed that Hg fall within the category of ""high pollution"" in sediments of Bamdedj marsh. This is clearly evident through bulk chemical analysis as well as chemical partitioning studies. The elements such as Fe and Zn fall within ""no pollution"" class. Therefore, we can suggest a lithogenous source for Zn. Through cluster analysis we could not bring out a proper source for Zn but combination of chemical analysis and cluster analysis can show a better means of interpretation of data. It should be pointed out cadmium falls within ""medium pollution"" class according to geochemical index. Figure Presented Fig. 1: Cluster analysis for studied metals in Bamdedj marsh sediment It seems that a great portion of metals have been incorporated into the sediments through usage of agricultural fertilizers that are being widely used by farmers. It can be concluded that agricultural activities are the major source for distribution of metals in Bamdedj sediments since there are not any industrial activities in the vicinity of marsh. It should be pointed out that sewages from residential sector can also contribute to the metal pollution in marsh. The presence of Ca in loosely bonded ions can be attributed to the nature of Ca to dissociate from contaminant sources at lower pHs. A higher pollution. Herewith, we suggest that Environmental Planning Management (EMP) should be prepared to monitor the pollution in marsh from time to time. The EMP should be simple with minimum parameters (such as Hg as an indicator) and the period of measurement should be feasible and economical. Also the future studies should focus on sediment and water interaction to know about the risk assessment of metals in dissolved form. On the other hand, the bio-availability of the metals should be examined in the sediments to possible know about the risk of transfer of metals into the aquatic life of marsh.",Anthropogenic proportion; Atomic absorption; Bamdezh wetland; Chemical analysis; Cluster analysis; Heavy metals; Natural proportion,,
Meta-analysis of cotton fiber quality QTLs across diverse environments in a Gossypium hirsutum x G. barbadense RIL population,"Lacape J.-M., Llewellyn D., Jacobs J., Arioli T., Becker D., Calhoun S., Al-Ghazi Y., Liu S., Palaï O., Georges S., Giband M., de Assunção H., Barroso P.A.V., Claverie M., Gawryziak G., Jean J., Vialle M., Viot C.",2010,BMC Plant Biology,"Background: Cotton fibers (produced by Gossypium species) are the premier natural fibers for textile production. The two tetraploid species, G. barbadense (Gb) and G. hirsutum (Gh), differ significantly in their fiber properties, the former having much longer, finer and stronger fibers that are highly prized. A better understanding of the genetics and underlying biological causes of these differences will aid further improvement of cotton quality through breeding and biotechnology. We evaluated an inter-specific Gh × Gb recombinant inbred line (RIL) population for fiber characteristics in 11 independent experiments under field and glasshouse conditions. Sites were located on 4 continents and 5 countries and some locations were analyzed over multiple years.Results: The RIL population displayed a large variability for all major fiber traits. QTL analyses were performed on a per-site basis by composite interval mapping. Among the 651 putative QTLs (LOD > 2), 167 had a LOD exceeding permutation based thresholds. Coincidence in QTL location across data sets was assessed for the fiber trait categories strength, elongation, length, length uniformity, fineness/maturity, and color. A meta-analysis of more than a thousand putative QTLs was conducted with MetaQTL software to integrate QTL data from the RIL and 3 backcross populations (from the same parents) and to compare them with the literature. Although the global level of congruence across experiments and populations was generally moderate, the QTL clustering was possible for 30 trait x chromosome combinations (5 traits in 19 different chromosomes) where an effective co-localization of unidirectional (similar sign of additivity) QTLs from at least 5 different data sets was observed. Most consistent meta-clusters were identified for fiber color on chromosomes c6, c8 and c25, fineness on c15, and fiber length on c3.Conclusions: Meta-analysis provided a reliable means of integrating phenotypic and genetic mapping data across multiple populations and environments for complex fiber traits. The consistent chromosomal regions contributing to fiber quality traits constitute good candidates for the further dissection of the genetic and genomic factors underlying important fiber characteristics, and for marker-assisted selection. © 2010 Lacape et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Gossypium; Gossypium barbadense; Gossypium hirsutum; analysis of variance; article; breeding; chromosome map; cluster analysis; cotton; environment; genetic variability; genetics; meta analysis; phenotype; quantitative trait locus; standard; Analysis of Variance; Breeding; Chromosome Mapping; Cluster Analysis; Cotton Fiber; Environment; Genetic Variation; Gossypium; Phenotype; Quantitative Trait Loci,
A review of the empirical evidence on generational differences in work attitudes,Twenge J.M.,2010,Journal of Business and Psychology,"Purpose: This article reviews the evidence for generational differences in work values from time-lag studies (which can separate generation from age/career stage) and cross-sectional studies (which cannot). Understanding generational shifts is especially important given the coming retirement of Baby Boomer workers and their replacement by those born after 1982 (GenMe/GenY/Millennials). Findings: Most studies, including the few time-lag studies, show that GenX and especially GenMe rate work as less central to their lives, value leisure more, and express a weaker work ethic than Boomers and Silents. Extrinsic work values (e.g., salary) are higher in GenMe and especially GenX. Contrary to popular conceptions, there were no generational differences in altruistic values (e.g., wanting to help others). Conflicting results appeared in desire for job stability, intrinsic values (e.g., meaning), and social/affiliative values (e.g., making friends). GenX, and especially GenMe are consistently higher in individualistic traits. Overall, generational differences are important where they appear, as even small changes at the average mean that twice or three times as many individuals score at the top of the distribution. Implications: To recruit GenMe, companies should focus on work-life balance issues and flexible schedules. Programs based on volunteering, altruistic values, social values, or meaning in work will likely be no more successful than they were for previous generations. The lack of generational differences in job hopping suggests that GenMe workers who are satisfied will be retained. Originality/value: No previous review has summarized all of the available studies examining generational differences in work values. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.",Extrinsic values; Generations; Leisure; Work ethic; Work values,,
Low-temperature deposition of high quality β-FeSi2 films by co-sputtering of Fe and Si for β-FeSi2/Si heterojunction solar cell,"Hou G., Yu C., Liu F., Sun J., Geng X., Zhao Y.",2010,Physica Status Solidi (C) Current Topics in Solid State Physics,"Single-phase β-FeSi2 films have been prepared by Fe-Si mixed targets in a facing target sputtering (FTS) system. Compared with depositing iron on silicon, co-sputtering of Fe and Si atoms in as-deposited samples guarantees that Fe and Si atoms only need relative low energy via short distance migration to form iron silicide during the annealing process, which helps decreasing annealing temperature and reducing annealing time. Then pure single-phase β-FeSi2 films can be obtained at a low annealing temperature 600 °C in this instance. By adjusting the sputtering areas of Fe and Si targets, it's convenient to control the Fe/Si atom ratios in as-deposited samples and thus p-type and n-type films can be obtained easily. The best n-type β-FeSi2 film on Si(111) substrate shows an electron concentration of 1.7×1016 cm-3 and a Hall mobility of 488cm2/Vs, respectively.

Black Carbon determination in Particulate Matter deposited on standard Teflon filters,"Cuccia E., Massabò D., Prati P.",2010,Nuovo Cimento della Societa Italiana di Fisica B,"Elemental Carbon (EC) is an important component of Particulate Matter (PM) and, when determined by optical method, it is usually referred as Black Carbon (BC). Teflon (PTFE®) membranes are very appropriate for gravimetric and compositional analyses of PM and 47 mm filters with 2 μm pores are very often used to collect PM samples on daily basis. We describe here a simple, non-destructive, optical method to measure, on the PTFE filters routinely used for PM studies, the BC content basically without any sizeable extra-cost. This gives the opportunity to measure in each sample the concentration of: total PM by gravimetric analysis, metals by, for instance, X-Ray Fluorescence, major ions by Ion Chromatography and BC. All these pieces of information can therefore be obtained with just one filter and with the sureness to analyze the same PM. Time series of such data are the basic input to source apportionment methods by receptor models. Furthermore, this approach also allows the analysis of particular samples as those collected by multistage cascade impactors and thus it provides information on the BC size distribution. © Società Italiana di Fisica.",,,
Triclosan: A critical review of the experimental data and development of margins of safety for consumer products,"Rodricks J.V., Swenberg J.A., Borzelleca J.F., Maronpot R.R., Shipp A.M.",2010,Critical Reviews in Toxicology,"Triclosan (2,4,4′-trichloro-2′-hydroxy-diphenyl ether) is an antibacterial compound that has been used in consumer products for about 40 years. The tolerability and safety of triclosan has been evaluated in human volunteers with little indication of toxicity or sensitization. Although information in humans from chronic usage of personal care products is not available, triclosan has been extensively studied in laboratory animals. When evaluated in chronic oncogenicity studies in mice, rats, and hamsters, treatment-related tumors were found only in the liver of male and female mice. Application of the Human Relevance Framework suggested that these tumors arose by way of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) activation, a mode of action not considered to be relevant to humans. Consequently, a Benchmark Dose (BMDL10) of 47mg/kg/day was developed based on kidney toxicity in the hamster. Estimates of the amount of intake from in the use of representative personal care products for men, women, and children were derived in two ways: (1) using known or assumed triclosan levels in various consumer products and assumed usage patterns (product-based estimates); and (2) using upper bound measured urinary triclosan levels from human volunteers (biomonitoring-based estimates) using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the product-based estimates, the margin of safety (MOS) for the combined exposure estimates of intake from the use of all triclosan-containing products considered were approximately 1000, 730, and 630 for men, women, and children, respectively. The MOS calculated from the biomonitoring-based estimated intakes were 5200, 6700, and 11,750 for men, women, and children, respectively. Based on these results, exposure to triclosan in consumer products is not expected to cause adverse health effects in children or adults who use these products as intended. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.",Exposure assessment; Margin of safety; PPAR; Safety assessment; Triclosan,"1,1 dichloro 2,2,2 trifluoroethane; 2 ethylhexanol; 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; 2,4,5 trichlorophenoxyacetic acid; adipic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; bezafibrate; cinnamyl anthranilate; ciprofibrate; clobuzarit; clofibrate; dichloroacetic acid; diclofopmethyl; gemfibrozil; haloxyfop; methylclofenapate; mouthwash; nafenopin; oxadiazon; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; pirinixic acid; pirinixil; tetrachloroethylene; tomelukast; toothpaste; trichloroacetic acid; trichloroethylene; triclosan; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; antibacterial activity; baboon; biological monitoring; body weight; carcinogenicity; chromosome aberration; clinical trial; consumer; cytotoxicity; disease control; dose response; drug absorption; drug administration route; drug distribution; drug excretion; drug mechanism; drug megadose; drug metabolism; drug monitoring; drug safety; drug sensitization; drug tolerability; drug urine level; drug use; embryotoxicity; gene mutation; genotoxicity; hamster; human; in vitro study; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; mutagenicity; nephrotoxicity; nonhuman; photosensitization; review; risk assessment; sensitization; skin irritation; species difference; toxicology; urine level; Adult; Animals; Benchmarking; Child; Clinical Trials as Topic; Consumer Product Safety; Cosmetics; Cricetinae; Environmental Health; Female; Humans; Male; Mice; PPAR alpha; Rats; Soaps; Triclosan; Animalia; Cricetinae; Mus; Rattus",
The impact of disclosing financial ties in research and clinical care: A systematic review,"Licurse A., Barber E., Joffe S., Gross C.",2010,Archives of Internal Medicine,"Background: Despite increased demand for disclosure of physician and researcher financial ties (FTs) to industry, little is known about patients', research participants', or journal readers' attitudes toward FTs. Methods: We systematically reviewed original, quantitative studies of patients', research participants', or journal readers' views about FTs to pharmaceutical and medical device companies. The MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge databases were searched for English-language studies containing original, quantitative data on attitudes toward FTs. We screened 6561 citations and retrieved 244 potentially eligible abstracts. Of these, 20 met inclusion criteria. Results: Eleven studies assessed FTs and perceptions of quality. In clinical care, patients believed FTs decreased the quality and increased the cost of care. In research, FTs affected perceptions of study quality. In 2 studies, readers' perceptions of journal article quality decreased after disclosure of FTs. Eight studies assessed the acceptability of FTs. Patients were more likely to view personal gifts to physicians as unacceptable, compared with professional gifts. In 6 of the 10 studies that assessed the importance of disclosure, most patients and research participants believed FTs should be disclosed; in the other 4, approximately one-quarter believed FTs should be disclosed. Among the 7 studies assessing willingness to participate in research, approximately one-quarter of participants reported less willingness after disclosure of FTs. Conclusions: Patients believe that FTs influence professional behavior and should be disclosed. Patients, physicians, and research participants believe FTs decrease the quality of research evidence, and, for some, knowledge of FTs would affect willingness to participate in research. ©2010 American Medical Association.

Porous iron pellets for AMS 14C analysis of small samples down to ultra-microscale size (10-25 μgC),"de Rooij M., van der Plicht J., Meijer H.A.J.",2010,"Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms","We developed the use of a porous iron pellet as a catalyst for AMS 14C analysis of small samples down to ultra-microscale size (10-25 μgC). It resulted in increased and more stable beam currents through our HVEE 4130 14C AMS system, which depend smoothly on the sample size. We find that both the expected decrease of oxalic acid standards and increase of backgrounds with decreasing sample size, due to increasing influence of contamination, are reproducible. Using a mass-dependent background correction for dead (1.0 ± 0.4 μgC) and modern (0.25 ± 0.10 μgC) contamination, we obtain reliable results for small samples down to 10 μgC and possibly smaller. Due to our low graphitization yield for ultra-small samples (increases from 40% to 80% on average with sample size), we measured graphite standards as small as 3 μgC. The standard deviation of the corrected activity is about 5% for a 10-μgC HOxII standard. Here we report the iron pellet technique, which is new to the best of our knowledge. It is generally applicable for AMS 14C laboratories that want to measure small samples down to ultra-microscale size.

Heavy metal pollution of the world largest antimony mine-affected agricultural soils in Hunan province (China),"Wang X., He M., Xie J., Xi J., Lu X.",2010,Journal of Soils and Sediments,"Purpose: The present work concerns the distribution of ten heavy metals (Sb, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in the surrounding agricultural soils of the world largest antimony (Sb) mine in China. The objective is to explore the degree and spatial distribution of heavy metal pollution of the Sb mine-affected agricultural soils. The presented data were compared with metal concentrations in soils from mining and smelting sites in China and other countries. Materials and methods: There were 29 environmental samples in all that were collected in the year 2008 for this study. Soil characteristic parameters such as pH, total organic carbon, and cation exchange capacity were determined. Metal contents were determined after digestion in a Teflon bomb with aqua regia. Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. As, Sb, and Hg concentrations were determined by atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS-2202). Fe, Al, Cr, and Mn concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. Results and discussion: Almost all of the ten heavy metals exhibited much higher concentrations compared with their respective natural background values, especially Sb, and they varied with sampling site. The enriched factor values show that Sb (235.8), Cd (51.8), Hg (13.8), As (3.13), Zn (2.91), Pb (2.46), and Cr (1.67) are significantly accumulated in the study area. All of the integrated pollution indexes (IPI > 3) calculated from pollution indexes show that the soils are severely contaminated by investigated heavy metals. Principal component analysis, cluster analysis, and correlation analysis suggest that Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, and Mn are derived from the sulfide mineralization paragenesis in Xikuangshan area. Cr, As, Hg, Al, and Sb are mainly due to the mining and smelting activities of this area and derived from organic matters, and Ni is mainly generated from agricultural activities. These metal concentrations in Xikuangshan agricultural topsoil are comparable or within the ranges of those in mine areas of other countries. Conclusions: The heavy metal concentrations in the topsoil of Xikuangshan area are mostly higher than the background values, especially for Sb and As. Heavy metal pollution has spread in this mine area, both from mining activities and agricultural activities. Analysis of soil samples from 23 sampling locations of the area show significant spatial variation of the ten heavy metals. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",China; Enrichment; Heavy metals; Multivariate statistics; Pollution load index; Xikuangshan,agricultural soil; antimony; heavy metal; human activity; ion exchange; mass spectrometry; multivariate analysis; principal component analysis; sampling; soil pollution; spatial distribution; topsoil; China; Hunan; Xikuangshan,
Supramolecular 1D assemblies of polyfluorinated arylenediamines and 18-crown-6,"Kusov S.Z., Gatilov Y.V., Bagryanskaya I.Y., Romanenko G.V., Vaganova T.A., Shundrina I.K., Malykhin E.V.",2010,Russian Chemical Bulletin,"Rods (1D assemblies) formed by alternate crown ether and arylenediamine molecules are the motif of the supramolecular architecture of crystals of molecular associates of 18-crown-6 with tetrafluoro-1,4- and -1,3-phenylenediamines, hexafluoro-2,6- and -2, 7-naphthylenedi- amines.

Investigation of stainless steel corrosion in ultrahigh-purity water and steam systems by surface analytical techniques,"Dong X., Iacocca R.G., Bustard B.L., Kemp C.A.J.",2010,Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance,"Stainless steel pipes with different degrees of rouging and a Teflon ®-coated rupture disc with severe corrosion were thoroughly investigated by combining multiple surface analytical techniques. The surface roughness and iron oxide layer thickness increase with increasing rouge severity, and the chromium oxide layer coexists with the iron oxide layer in samples with various degrees of rouging. Unlike the rouging observed for stainless steel pipes, the fast degradation of the rupture disc was caused by a crevice corrosion environment created by perforations in the protective Teflon coating. This failure analysis clearly shows the highly corrosive nature of ultrapure water used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products, and demonstrates some of the unexpected corrosion mechanisms that can be encountered in these environments. © 2009 ASM International.",Corrosion; Pharmaceutical; Rouge; Stainless steel; Surface analysis,Analytical techniques; Chromium oxides; Corrosion mechanisms; Crevice corrosion; Iron oxide layers; Multiple surfaces; Pharmaceutical; Pharmaceutical products; Severe corrosion; Stainless steel surface; Steam systems; Ultra high purity; Ultra-pure water; Biological materials; Chromium; Corrosion resistant alloys; Failure analysis; Iron; Iron oxides; Metal analysis; Petroleum pipelines; Protective coatings; Quality assurance; Safety factor; Steel corrosion; Steel pipe; Surface analysis; Surface roughness; Water analysis; Stainless steel,
"Asymmetric synthesis of fluorine-containing amines, amino alcohols, α- and β-amino acids mediated by chiral sulfinyl group","Sorochinsky A.E., Soloshonok V.A.",2010,Journal of Fluorine Chemistry,"This review article provides a critical overview of several different synthetic approaches developed for asymmetric preparation of fluorine-containing amines, amino alcohols, α- and β-amino acids. The common feature of these methods is the application of sulfinyl group as a chiral auxiliary to control the stereochemical outcome of the reactions under study. In particular, the following general methods are critically discussed: diastereoselective methylene transfer from diazomethane to the carbonyl of β-keto-γ-fluoroalkyl sulfoxides as a general approach for preparation of various α-fluoroalkyl α-sulfinylalkyl oxiranes. The resulting compounds were used as true chiral synthons for their further elaboration via oxidative or reductive desulfurization, to numerous fluorine-containing and biologically relevant amino- and hydroxy-containing derivatives. Another general approaches discussed here are asymmetric additions to C{double bond, long}N double bond. One of them is addition of chiral sulfoxide stabilized carbon nucleophiles to fluorine-containing imines, leading to convenient preparation of alpha-fluoroalkyl derivatives of alpha amino acids and amines. Another approach is asymmetric Reformatsky reaction between N-sulfinyl imines and ethyl bromodifluoroacetate allowing operationally convenient preparation of α,α-difluoro-β-amino acids in enantiomerically pure form. Finally, structurally similar but mechanistically different addition reactions of diethyl difluoromethylphosphonate to N-sulfinyl imines, as a general approach to asymmetric synthesis of α,α-difluoro-β-aminophosphonates and phosphonic acids, are discussed. Effect of fluorine on the mechanism and stereochemical outcome of these reactions is discussed in detail and compared, where it is possible, with that of the analogous reactions of fluorine-free substrates. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A global review of polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardant contamination in birds,"Chen D., Hale R.C.",2010,Environment International,"As a consequence of substantial, long-term usage, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have contaminated humans, wildlife, and abiotic matrices around the world. Although several reports have reviewed PBDE contamination in general, none have focused specifically on birds. Birds have long been recognized as invaluable monitoring species for organohalogen contamination. This review summarizes most available PBDE data in birds and emphasizes several specific aspects, i.e., inter-regional differences in PBDE contamination, the extent of BDE-209 contamination, differences in congener composition patterns between piscivorous and terrestrial-feeding birds, trophic biomagnification and temporal changes in PBDE contamination. A meta-analysis of PBDE congener profiles reveals distinctly different patterns between birds utilizing terrestrial and aquatic food webs. Terrestrial-feeding birds appear to exhibit heightened Deca-BDE contamination. Inter-regional comparisons reveal elevated PBDE burdens in North American aquatic birds compared to those from the rest of the world, likely related to greater Penta-BDE demand there. Examination of North American and Chinese terrestrial birds also exhibited some of the highest BDE-209 concentrations ever reported in wildlife, and suggested that urban environments in general and some commercial activities (e.g., electronic recycling) may increase exposure of wildlife and humans to Deca-BDE. Summaries of temporal trend studies suggest that varying usage histories and regulations have influenced PBDE contamination patterns at different regions. As a consequence of continued usage of Deca-BDE around the world, significant increases in BDE-209 burdens have been observed in both North American and European birds. Examination of both wild and laboratory-exposed birds also indicated potential degradation of BDE-209 to less brominated, but more bioavailable/toxic congeners. Therefore, it would be wise to reduce releases of Deca-BDE, the only PBDE formulation remaining in production, to the environment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",BDE-209; Biomagnification; Bird; PBDEs; Temporal trend; Terrestrial-feeding,Animals; Birds; Chemical contamination; Contamination; Ethers; Feeding; Polyacrylates; Bde-209; Biomagnification; Congener compositions; Organohalogen contamination; PBDEs; Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Regional differences; Temporal trends; Organic pollutants; polybrominated diphenyl ether; decabromobiphenyl ether; diphenyl ether derivative; flame retardant; pollutant; biomonitoring; bird; degradation; feeding; meta-analysis; PBDE; pollution effect; temporal analysis; trend analysis; urban area; urban pollution; animal food; Antarctica; Asia; bioaccumulation; biological monitoring; bird; concentration (parameters); debromination; ecotoxicology; environmental exposure; Europe; food chain; geographic distribution; nonhuman; pollution monitoring; priority journal; review; trend study; United States; animal; environmental monitoring; metabolism; pollutant; toxicity; Animals; Birds; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Flame Retardants; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers,Elsevier Ltd
Dioxins and organohalogen contaminants in the Asia-Pacific region,"Tanabe S., Minh T.B.",2010,Ecotoxicology,"This article reviews the outcome of comprehensive investigations conducted in our laboratory at CMES, Ehime University over the past three decades on the distribution, sources, temporal trends and toxic impacts of the persistent and bioaccumulative organohalogen contaminants in Asia-Pacific region with a particular emphasis on developing countries. Results of multi-media monitoring studies were compiled and discussed to provide in-depth understanding on various issues of dioxins and organohalogen contamination in both ambient environment and animals including humans. Prominent contaminations were found in the regions where they have been heavily used. The eastern Asian region is probably a potential source of pollution, particularly by the new contaminants such as polybrominated diphenyls ethers. These groups of contaminants, together with polychlorinated biphenyls, exhibited either decreasing or increasing trends depending on the extent of industrialization in Asian developing region, indicating the necessity for long term monitoring. The open dumping sites for municipal wastes in major cities are significant sources of many toxic chemicals, and these areas are probably one of the challenges for future research due to the long term impacts on the environmental quality and human health. The formation of dioxins and related compounds in such dumping sites and their elevated residues found in breast milk of residents living in and around warrant long term impacts of dioxins upon next generations. Comprehensive and long term monitoring programs are urgently needed with close collaboration and proper capacity building in Asian developing countries in order to mitigate dioxin and organohalogen emission and their risk on ecosystems and human health. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Asia-Pacific; Dioxins; Human exposure; Open dumping sites; Organohalogen contaminants; Temporal trends,"dioxin; organohalogen derivative; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; benzofuran derivative; chlorinated dibenzofurans; dioxin; diphenyl ether derivative; drug derivative; polychlorodibenzo 4 dioxin; polychlorodibenzo-4-dioxin; sea water; chemical pollutant; developing world; dioxin; environmental quality; health risk; organohalogen; PCB; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; Asia; bioaccumulation; biodiversity; breast milk; contamination; developing country; ecosystem; environmental exposure; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; health; health hazard; human; industrialization; nonhuman; Pacific Ocean; pollution; priority journal; review; risk; risk assessment; urbanization; waste management; animal; chemistry; environmental exposure; forecasting; statistics; waste disposal; water pollutant; water pollution; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim; Animalia; Animals; Asia; Benzofurans; Dioxins; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Forecasting; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Milk, Human; Pacific Ocean; Refuse Disposal; Risk Assessment; Seawater; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical",

Pollution by psychoactive pharmaceuticals in the Rivers of Madrid metropolitan area (Spain),"González Alonso S., Catalá M., Maroto R.R., Gil J.L.R., de Miguel Á.G., Valcárcel Y.",2010,Environment International,"There are a number of reports in the literature which describe the occurrence of so-called emerging pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, in surface water. Few of these studies have reported values from large cities in relatively arid areas, such as in Spain. The persistence of some pharmaceuticals to usual wastewater treatments allows their discharge into surface waters. It is increasingly evident that mental health problems are of special concern for public health since psychiatric drugs are used in large amounts. Compared to other countries, Spain has a high pharmaceutical consumption rate, and Madrid metropolitan area is one of the most densely populated areas in Europe. The aim of the present study was to determine the presence of different psychoactive pharmaceuticals and metabolites in the main rivers of Madrid metropolitan area: Jarama, Manzanares, Guadarrama, Henares and Tajo. Sampling was done downstream of ten sewage treatment plants (STP) discharging into these rivers. Control points upstream of STPs discharge points were also sampled. Pharmaceutical compounds and metabolites for analysis were selected according to human consumption and prescription rates in Madrid, and the availability of valid techniques for detection. We observed residues of the antidepressants fluoxetine (80% of the sampling sites), citalopram (60%) and venlafaxine (100%), the anxiolytics nordiazepam (90%), oxazepam (80%) and 7-aminoflunitrazepam (10%) and the anticonvulsant carabamazepine (70%). Measured concentrations equalled or exceeded those reported for other geographical areas, although there is a pronounced lack of information for the anxiolytics and venlafaxine. This is of special concern given that Wyeth-Ayerst's venlafaxine, Effexor, was the 10th greatest selling pharmaceutical worldwide in 2006. We conclude that the origin of pharmaceutical pollution in the rivers of Madrid is mainly the discharge of sewage treatment plants in Madrid's metropolitan area and a comprehensive monitoring program should be implemented. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Liquid-liquid segmented flows in polymer microfluidic channels,"Kim N., Murphy M.C., Soper S.A., Nikitopoulos D.E.",2009,"Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Nanochannels, Microchannels, and Minichannels 2009, ICNMM2009","Liquid-liquid segmented flows in microchannels fabricated on polymer test chips were investigated experimentally. Polymer test chips were prepared using hot embossing of polycarbonate (PC) sheets with micro-milled brass mold inserts. Three different configurations of microchannels were prepared with injection to test channels expansion ratios of 16, 4 and 2 and a fixed test channel geometry. Deionized water with blue food-coloring dye (1% v/v) was used as a dispersed fluid at flow rates (QD) between 0.5 and 60 μl/min. The carrier fluid was perfluorocarbon (FC 3283) with nonionic fluorous-soluble surfactant (Perfluorooctanol, 10% v/v) at flow rates (QC) between 3 and 25 μ1/min. The two fluids were injected separately into the chips. Droplet and Plug flows with transient Irregular Segmented flows between two flow regimes were mainly observed in the test channels of the three different chips. Flow pattern maps and transitions between flow regimes were determined in terms of a fixed homogeneous carrier fluid volumetric flow ratio (βC) to compare the effect of the expansion ratios from the injection to the test channels. The droplet and plug regimes were shifted to higher carrier and lower dispersed fluid superficial velocities and the plug flow regime was broader with the lower expansion ratio channels. The transient irregular segmented flow was favored in the higher expansion channel ratio and the interval of transient irregular segmented flow between droplet and plug flow regimes were shorter for the low expansion channel ratios. This is evidence that flow regime maps in micro-channels are not universal and depend on the configuration part of the microinjection system. The length of the dispersed segmented flows and the distance between consecutive droplets or plugs as a function of βC were determined by image processing of frames acquired via CCD camera with bright field illumination. The average length of the dispersed fluid was shown to scale approximately with βC to the -1.2 power. Velocities of the dispersed droplet and plug flows were measured using double-pulsed laser illumination and were found to be 1.25 ± 0.049 and 1.46 ± 0.077 times faster than the superficial velocity of the segmented flow respectively. Two-phase pressure drop measurements were also carried out for all flow regimes and associated trends were correlated with changes in flow topology. Comparisons of experimental pressure drop with the predictions for a modified Lockhart-Martinelli correlation were also made.

"Sensors as tools for quantitation, nanotoxicity and nanomonitoring assessment of engineered nanomaterials","Sadik O.A., Zhou A.L., Kikandi S., Du N., Wang Q., Varner K.",2009,Journal of Environmental Monitoring,"The discovery of fullerenes in 1985 has ushered in an explosive growth in the applications of engineered nanomaterials and consumer products. Nanotechnology and engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are being incorporated into a range of commercial products such as consumer electronics, cosmetics, imaging and sensors. Nanomaterials offer new possibilities for the development of novel sensing and monitoring technologies. Nanosensors can be classified under two main categories: (i) Nanotechnology-enabled sensors or sensors that are themselves nanoscale or have nanoscale materials or components, and (ii) Nanoproperty-quantifiable sensors or sensors that are used to measure nanoscale properties. The first category can eventually result in lower material cost, reduced weight and energy consumption. The second category can enhance our understanding of the potential toxic effects of emerging pollutants from nanomaterials including fullerenes, dendrimers, and carbon nanotubes. Despite the enormous literatures and reviews on Category I sensors, there are few sensors to measure nanoscale properties or sensors belonging to Category II. This class of nanosensors is an area of critical interest to nanotoxicology, detection and risk assessment, as well as for monitoring of environmental and/or biological exposure. This article discusses emerging fields of nanotoxicology and nanomonitoring including the challenges of characterizing engineered nanomaterials and the potentials of combining existing analytical techniques with conventional cytotoxicity methods. Two case studies are provided for development of Category II nanosensors for fullerene nanoparticles and quantum dots. One highlights the uniqueness of a portable, dissolved oxygen electrochemical sensor arrays capable of detecting the ENMs as well as provide rapid nanotoxicological information. This review has shown that addressing the complex and critical issues surrounding the environmental transformation and toxicity of ENMs must be accompanied by the creation of new approaches or further developments of existing instrumentation. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,carbon nanotube; cosmetic; dendrimer; fullerene derivative; nanomaterial; nanoparticle; quantum dot; analytic method; cost control; cytotoxicity; electrochemical analysis; electronics; energy consumption; environmental monitoring; human; imaging system; measurement; nanoengineering; nanotechnology; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; review; risk assessment; sensor; toxicity testing; weight; Animals; Engineering; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Risk Assessment,
Methodological considerations in the development of HPLC-MS methods for the analysis of rodent plasma for metabonomic studies,"Lai L., Michopoulos F., Gika H., Theodoridis G., Wilkinson R.W., Odedra R., Wingate J., Bonner R., Tate S., Wilson I.D.",2009,Molecular BioSystems,"A study of the factors involved in obtaining valid global metabolite profiles from the HPLC-MS of rat or mouse plasma for the purposes of metabonomic analysis has been undertaken. Plasma proteins were precipitated with three volumes of either methanol or acetonitrile. Chromatographic separations were performed on a C18-bonded stationary phase using 3.5 and 5 μm particles packed into 2.1 and 4.6 mm i.d. formats, respectively, and on a C8 phase using 3.5 μm particles and a 2.1 mm i.d. column. Three reversed-phase gradient solvent systems, based on acidified water-acetonitrile, acidified water-methanol and acidified water-methanol-acetonitrile mixtures, were investigated. The column eluent was analysed with both positive and negative electrospray ionisation using a quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer. These studies revealed that while accurate classification of sample type can be made, there are a number of methodological problems associated with the analysis of plasma with respect to factors such as repeatability and column longevity. In particular, special care has to be taken to ensure that the analytical system is properly ""conditioned"" by the repeated injection of matrix samples. The use of biological quality control (QC) samples provided an important means of monitoring method performance.

The clinical application of non-genetic biomarkers for differential diagnosis monogenic diabetes,"Owen K.R., Skupien J., Malecki M.T.",2009,Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice,"Diabetes mellitus is not a single disorder but rather a heterogeneous group of diseases that differ in respect to pathogenesis, the clinical picture and the response to dietary and pharmacological treatments. Thus, the differential diagnosis of various types and forms of diabetes is of great practical importance. This is particularly true for monogenic disease forms where some spectacular applications of pharmacogenetics have recently been described. Unfortunately, most patients with monogenic diabetes such as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) or neonatal diabetes have not undergone diagnostic molecular testing, so they can not benefit from the progress seen in this field. The reasons for this include the complexity and cost of molecular diagnostics. One of ways to change this situation is to find an efficient and cheap test to screen thousands of patients for specific forms of monogenic diabetes. These tests can be based on biomarkers discovered by one of two general strategies: a candidate approach or a systematic search based on metabonomics or proteonomics. This review summarizes recent advances in the search for putative biomarkers and the perspectives of the future progress. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Simultaneous analysis of diazepam and its metabolites in rat plasma and brain tissue by HPLC-UV and SPE,"Mercolini L., Mandrioli R., Iannello C., Matrisciano F., Nicoletti F., Raggi M.A.",2009,Talanta,"Diazepam is frequently used as an adjuvant during antidepressant therapy. Recently, some studies have suggested that the treatment with benzodiazepines could have different efficacy in depressed patients as opposed to non-depressed ones. To clarify the matter, a study is currently underway, regarding the drug metabolism in rats. In order to obtain a more complete and significant set of data, the main diazepam metabolites have also been considered, namely: nordiazepam, temazepam and oxazepam. A feasible and reliable HPLC method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of these compounds in plasma and brain tissue of rats. The method has been applied to ""normal"" rats and to genetic rat models of depression in order to estimate drug metabolism in different breeds. Analyte separation was achieved on a C8 reversed phase column using an acidic phosphate buffer/acetonitrile mixture as the mobile phase. The detection wavelength was 238 nm. An original sample pre-treatment, based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) was developed in order to eliminate endogenous interference, using only 250 μL of matrix (brain homogenate or plasma) for a complete analysis. The method has been validated with good results in terms of precision, extraction yield, sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy on both matrices and has been successfully applied to samples from some rats subjected to the preliminary study. The obtained data will hopefully contribute to the clarification of possible differences between depressed and non-depressed subjects with respect to benzodiazepine biotransformation. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Perfluoroalkyl sulfonic and carboxylic acids: A critical review of physicochemical properties, levels and patterns in waters and wastewaters, and treatment methods","Rayne S., Forest K.",2009,Journal of Environmental Science and Health - Part A Toxic/Hazardous Substances and Environmental Engineering,"Perfluorinated acids (PFAs) are an emerging class of environmental contaminants present in various environmental and biological matrices. Two major PFA subclasses are the perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) and carboxylic acids (PFCAs). The physicochemical properties and partitioning behavior for the linear PFA members are poorly understood and widely debated. Even less is known about the numerous branched congeners with varying perfluoroalkyl chain lengths, leading to confounding issues around attempts to constrain the properties of PFAs. Current computational methods are not adequate for reliable multimedia modeling efforts and risk assessments. These compounds are widely present in surface, ground, marine, and drinking waters at concentrations that vary from pg L- 1 to g L- 1. Concentration gradients of up to several orders of magnitude are observed in all types of aquatic systems and reflect proximity to known industrial sources concentrated near populated regions. Some wastewaters contain PFAs at mg L- 1 to low g L- 1 levels, or up to 10 orders of magnitude higher than present in more pristine receiving waters. With the exception of trifluoroacetic acid, which is thought to have both significant natural and anthropogenic sources, all PFSAs and PFCAs are believed to arise from human activities. Filtration and sorption technologies offer the most promising existing removal methods for PFAs in aqueous waste streams, although sonochemical approaches hold promise. Additional studies need to be conducted to better define opportunities from evaporative, extractive, thermal, advanced oxidative, direct and catalyzed photochemical, reductive, and biodegradation methods.

Environmental chemicals and thyroid function: An update,"Boas M., Main K.M., Feldt-Rasmussen U.",2009,"Current Opinion in Endocrinology, Diabetes and Obesity","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To overview the effects of endocrine disrupters on thyroid function. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies in recent years have revealed thyroid-disrupting properties of many environmentally abundant chemicals. Of special concern is the exposure of pregnant women and infants, as thyroid disruption of the developing fetus may have deleterious effects on neurological outcome. Evidence is reviewed for the following groups of chemicals: polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, flame retardants, pesticides, perfluorinated chemicals, phthalates, bisphenol A and ultraviolet filters. Chemicals may exert thyroid effects through a variety of mechanisms of action, and some publications have focused on elucidating the mechanisms of specific (groups of) chemicals. SUMMARY: A large variety of ubiquitous chemicals have been shown to have thyroid-disrupting properties, and the combination of mechanistic, epidemiological and exposure studies indicates that the ubiquitous human and environmental exposure to industrial chemicals may impose a serious threat to human and wildlife thyroid homeostasis. Currently, available evidence suggests that authorities need to regulate exposure to thyroid-disrupting chemicals of pregnant women, neonates and small children in order to avoid potential impairment of brain development. Future studies will indicate whether adults also are at risk of thyroid damage due to these chemicals. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",Brain development; Endocrine disrupters; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Thyroid; Thyroxine,"1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; 4 methoxycinnamic acid 2 ethylhexyl ester; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; chlorphenotane; dioxin; endocrine disruptor; environmental chemical; flame retardant; hexachlorobenzene; industrial chemical; liothyronine; nonylphenol; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pesticide; phthalic acid derivative; phthalic acid dibutyl ester; polybrominated biphenyl; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; tetrabromobisphenol A; thyroid hormone; thyroid hormone receptor; thyroid peroxidase antibody; thyrotropin; thyroxine; brain development; developmental disorder; environmental exposure; fetus development; free thyroxine index; homeostasis; human; intelligence quotient; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; retinol deficiency; review; thyroid function; thyrotoxicosis; toxicology; ultraviolet radiation; wildlife; Animals; Dioxins; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Pollutants; Flame Retardants; Humans; Pesticides; Phenols; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Sunscreening Agents; Thyroid Gland",
A semi-automated solid-phase extraction liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method for the analysis of tetrahydrocannabinol and metabolites in whole blood,"Jagerdeo E., Schaff J.E., Montgomery M.A., LeBeau M.A.",2009,Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry,"Marijuana is one of the most commonly abused illicit substances in the USA, making cannabinoids important to detect in clinical and forensic toxicology laboratories. Historically, cannabinoids in biological fluids have been derivatized and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/ MS). There has been a gradual shift in many laboratories towards liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) for this analysis due to its improved sensitivity and reduced sample preparation compared with GC/MS procedures. This paper reports a validated method for the analysis of Δ9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its two main metabolites, 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) and 11-hydroxy- Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-OH), in whole blood samples. The method has also been validated for cannabinol (CBD) and cannabidiol (CDN), two cannabinoids that were shown not to interfere with the method. This method has been successfully applied to samples both from living people and from deceased individuals obtained during autopsy. This method utilizes online solid-phase extraction (SPE) with LC/MS. Pretreatment of samples involves protein precipitation, sample concentration, ultracentrifugation, and reconstitution. The online SPE procedure was developed using Hysphere C8-EC sorbent. A chromatographic gradient with an Xterra MS C18 column was used for the separation. Four multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions were monitored for each analyte and internal standard. Linearity generally fell between 2 and 200ng/mL. The limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 0.5 to 3ng/mL and the limits of quantitation (LOQs) ranged from 2 to 8 ng/mL. The bias and imprecision were determined using a simple analysis of variance (ANOVA: single factor). The results demonstrate bias as &lt;7%, and imprecision as &lt;9%, for all components at each quantity control level.

"Non-metal elemental analysis by a compact low-energy, high-repetition rate laser-induced-breakdown spectrometer","Wagner C., Ewald J., Ankerhold G., Kohns P.",2009,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"A compact laser-induced-breakdown-spectroscopy (LIBS) system for surface elemental analysis using a low-energy, high-repetition rate Nd:YAG laser as excitation source has been developed. Elemental analyses were performed on various samples including non-metallic compounds and metal alloys. Fluorine and chlorine could be detected well qualitatively in different organic materials like Teflon FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene) or PVC (polyvinyl chloride). Furthermore, low concentrations of silicon, magnesium and copper in aluminum have been measured and could be backed up by EDX and XPS analysis. Results were confirmed with a conventional LIBS system using a high-energy, low-repetition rate Nd:YAG SHG laser operating at 10 Hz with a pulse energy of 200 mJ. Especially the results with fluorine containing samples are very promising and show that LIBS measurements of non-metallic samples are possible even at very low pulse energies with a manageable trade-off in signal strength. © 2009 SPIE.",Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy; LIBS; Material analysis,Compact lasers; Elemental analysis; Excitation sources; Fluorinated ethylene propylene; High energy; High repetition rate; Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy; LIBS; Low concentrations; Low energies; Low pulse energy; Material analysis; Metal alloys; ND : YAG lasers; Nd: YAG; Non-metallic; Nonmetallic compounds; Organic materials; Pulse energies; Repetition rate; Signal strengths; Surface elemental analysis; Teflon FEP; XPS analysis; Alumina; Chlorine; Chlorine compounds; Ethylene; Fluorine; Laser damage; Laser excitation; Laser pulses; Laser spectroscopy; Lasers; Magnesium; Metal analysis; Metallic compounds; Neodymium; Optical data processing; Optical testing; Optical variables measurement; Polymethyl methacrylates; Polyvinyl chlorides; Propylene; Pulsed laser applications; Spectroscopic analysis; Spectrum analysis; Neodymium lasers,
Trace analysis of released metallic ions in static immersion test for characterization of metallic biomaterials,"Ashino T., Ohtsu N., Wagatsuma K.",2009,Nippon Kinzoku Gakkaishi/Journal of the Japan Institute of Metals,"For characterization of corrosion resistance of metallic biomaterials, determination of trace amounts of metallic ions released from the materials in static immersion into simulated body fluids were investigated. In a pre-treatment method by sulfuric acid, sensitive, precise and accurate determination of the trace metallic elements in simulated body fluids could be performed by an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. For accurate analysis, it was necessary to employ a matrix-matched solution for the calibration. Moreover, usage of a vessel made of tetrafluoro ethylene-perfluoro alkylvinyl ether copolymer in the static immersion test was recommended for the prevention of contamination. Thus, it was possible to determine μg dm -3 order of elements in simulated body fluids and evaluate nano-gram order of the released metallic ions. © 2009 The Japan Institute of Metals.",Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry; Metallic biomaterials; Simulated body fluid; Static immersion test,Accurate analysis; Immersion tests; Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry; matrix; Metallic biomaterials; Metallic elements; Metallic ions; Pretreatment methods; Simulated body fluid; Simulated body fluids; Static immersion test; Trace amounts; Bioceramics; Body fluids; Corrosion resistance; Ethers; Ethylene; Fluids; Inductively coupled plasma; Ions; Leakage (fluid); Light emission; Metallic compounds; Optical emission spectroscopy; Photoresists; Prosthetics; Spectrometry; Sulfuric acid; Trace analysis; Trace elements; Plasma diagnostics,
Direct electrosynthesis and characterization of a new soluble polyfluorene derivative containing carboxyl group in boron trifluoride diethyl etherate,"Nie G., Guo Q., Zhang Y., Zhang S.",2009,European Polymer Journal,"High-quality poly(fluorene-9-acetic acid) (PFAA), a new soluble polyfluorene derivative, was synthesized electrochemically by direct anodic oxidation of fluorene-9-acetic acid (FAA) in boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BFEE) containing a certain amount of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). This electrolyte enables facile anodic oxidation of FAA monomer at lower potential (1.05 V vs. SCE). PFAA films with conductivity of 0.53 S cm-1 obtained from this medium showed better redox activity and thermal stability in relation to unsoluble poly(fluorene-9-carboxylic acid). Fluorescent spectral studies indicate that PFAA film with high fluorescence quantum yields and photochemical stability is a good blue-light emitter.

Innate immunity in the nervous system,"Ramaglia V., Baas F.",2009,Progress in Brain Research,"The complement (C) system plays a central role in innate immunity and bridges innate and adaptive immune responses. A fine balance of C activation and regulation mediates the elimination of invading pathogens and the protection of the host from excessive C deposition on healthy tissues.

Influence of production progress on the heavy metal content in flax fibers,"Szynkowska M.I., Rybicki E., Leśniewska E., Pawlaczyk A., Paryjczak T., Matyjas-Zgondek E.",2009,Chemical Papers,"The aim of this work was to determine the content of selected heavy metals in flax materials depending on the stage of fiber manufacturing. Non-treated natural fiber composition was compared with that of fibers processed. Changes in the composition of yarn before and after the following scutching, hackling, washing, and bleaching were also investigated. Analysis of heavy metals was performed applying inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Flax material was mineralized in closed Teflon vials with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid which were then placed in a microwave oven system. Analytical quality of the obtained results was checked by the determination of elements in the Certificate Reference Materials of IAEA-V-10. The acquired results proved that the content of metals in flax clearly varies depending on the treatment process applied (bleaching, washing, coloration). Significant differences were also connected with the dye used. © 2009 Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.",Bleaching; Dyeing; Flax fibers; ICP-QMS,,

The E23K variation in the KCNJ11 gene is associated with type 2 diabetes in Chinese and East Asian population,"Zhou D., Zhang D., Liu Y., Zhao T., Chen Z., Liu Z., Yu L., Zhang Z., Xu H., He L.",2009,Journal of Human Genetics,"The genes (ABCC8 and KCNJ11) have a key role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and thus have always been considered as excellent susceptibility candidates for involvement in type 2 diabetes. Common polymorphisms (KCNJ11 E23K and ABCC8 exon16-3t/c) in these genes have been reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes in various European-descent populations. However, there were inconsistent results in previous studies in East Asian populations and no large case-control studies have been carried out in the Chinese Han population. In this study, these two variants were genotyped in about 4000 Chinese by using TaqMan technology on an ABI7900 system. A meta-analysis was also used to assess the results of association between the two variants and type 2 diabetes in East Asian populations. Our investigation confirmed the association between the KCNJ11 E23K variant and type 2 diabetes under a recessive model (KK vs EKEE) in the Chinese Han population (odds ratio (OR)1.25, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.04-1.50, P0.017). The meta-analysis of East Asian populations also showed a strong significant association of the K allele with diabetes (OR1.15, P3 × 10 9), whereas the exon16-3t/c variant (rs1799854) in ABCC8 showed no significant association. Thus, the common E23K variant is considered as a strong candidate for type 2 diabetes susceptibility across different ethnicities. © 2009 The Japan Society of Human Genetics.",Association study; Chinese population; KCNJ11; Meta-analysis; Type 2 diabetes,"ABC transporter; ABC transporter C8; inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir6.2; unclassified drug; article; Asian; Chinese; controlled study; ethnic difference; exon; gene frequency; genetic risk; human; major clinical study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; single nucleotide polymorphism; Amino Acid Substitution; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; China; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Far East; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying",
Patent foramen ovale in cryptogenic stroke: Incidental or pathogenic?,"Alsheikh-Ali A.A., Thaler D.E., Kent D.M.",2009,Stroke,"Background and Purpose-Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is significantly associated with cryptogenic stroke (CS). However, even in patients with CS, a PFO can be an incidental finding. We sought to estimate the probability that a PFO in a patient with CS is incidental. Methods-A systematic search identified 23 case-control studies examining the prevalence of PFO in patients with CS versus control subjects with stroke of known cause. Using simple assumptions and Bayes' theorem, we calculated the probability a PFO is incidental in patients with CS. Random effects meta-analyses estimated the odds ratio (OR) of a PFO in CS versus control subjects in different age populations, with or without atrial septal aneurysms, and were used to summarize across studies the probability that a PFO in CS is incidental. Results-The summary OR (95% CIs) for PFO in CS versus control subjects was 2.9 (CI, 2.1 to 4.0). The corresponding ORs for young and old patients (< or >55 years) were 5.1 (3.3 to 7.8) and 2.0 (>1.0 to 3.7), respectively. The corresponding probabilities that a PFO in patients with CS is incidental were 33% (28% to 39%) in age-inclusive studies, 20% (16% to 25%) in younger patients, and 48% (34% to 66%) in older patients. These probabilities were much lower when an atrial septal aneurysm was present. Conclusions-In patients with otherwise CS, approximately one third of discovered PFOs are likely to be incidental and hence not benefit from closure. This probability is sensitive to patient characteristics such as age and the presence of an atrial septal aneurysm, suggesting the importance of patient selection in therapeutic decision-making. © 2009 American Heart Association Inc.",Patent foramen ovale; Risk factors for stroke; Secondary stroke prevention,"article; Bayes theorem; cerebrovascular accident; disease association; groups by age; human; patent foramen ovale; pathogenesis; prevalence; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; stroke; Age Factors; Bayes Theorem; Case-Control Studies; Foramen Ovale, Patent; Humans; Incidental Findings; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Stroke",
Optimization of parameters of the chemic kinetic model by improved genetic algorithms,"Rui-Feng H., Yu-Li Y., Yong-Kui Z.",2009,"Proceedings - 2nd International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology and Security Informatics, IITSI 2009","Detailed kinetic model is one of the most important basic research items that the chemic synthesis techniques will have been commercialized from laboratory.

As an unlimited algorithm, LM algorithm often makes an erroreous conclusion because of parameters exceeding limit. Its computation deeply depends on the initial point, and easily falls into non-global optima. It is a new attempt to apply GA(Genetic Algorithm) to the solutions of optimization problems of FTS(Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis) parameters.

Evidence for the involvement of xenobiotic-responsive nuclear receptors in transcriptional effects upon perfluoroalkyl acid exposure in diverse species,"Ren H., Vallanat B., Nelson D.M., Yeung L.W.Y., Guruge K.S., Lam P.K.S., Lehman-McKeeman L.D., Corton J.C.",2009,Reproductive Toxicology,"Humans and ecological species have been found to have detectable body burdens of a number of perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAA) including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). In mouse and rat liver these compounds elicit transcriptional and phenotypic effects similar to peroxisome proliferator chemicals (PPC) that work through the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Recent studies indicate that along with PPARα other nuclear receptors are required for transcriptional changes in the mouse liver after PFOA exposure including the constitutive activated receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) that regulate xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XME). To determine the potential role of CAR/PXR in mediating effects of PFAAs in rat liver, we performed a meta-analysis of transcript profiles from published studies in which rats were exposed to PFOA or PFOS. We compared the profiles to those produced by exposure to prototypical activators of CAR, (phenobarbital (PB)), PXR (pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN)), or PPARα (WY-14,643 (WY)). As expected, PFOA and PFOS elicited transcript profile signatures that included many known PPARα target genes. Numerous XME genes were also altered by PFOA and PFOS but not WY. These genes exhibited expression changes shared with PB or PCN. Reexamination of the transcript profiles from the livers of chicken or fish exposed to PFAAs indicated that PPARα, CAR, and PXR orthologs were not activated. Our results indicate that PFAAs under these experimental conditions activate PPARα, CAR, and PXR in rats but not chicken and fish.

Provision of LCI data in the European aluminium industry Methods and examples,Leroy C.,2009,International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,"Background, aim, and scope: The development of robust and up-to-date generic life cycle inventory data for materials is absolutely crucial for the LCA community since many LCA studies rely on these generic data about materials. LCA databases and software usually include within their package such generic LCI datasets. However, in many cases, the quality of these data is poor while the methodology and the models used for their development are rarely accessible or transparent. This paper presents the development of robust European LCI datasets for the production of primary and recycled aluminium ingots and for the transformation of aluminium ingot into semi-finished products, i.e. sheet, foil and extrusion. Materials and methods: The environmental data have been collected through an extensive environmental survey, organised among the European aluminium industry, focusing on the year 2005 and covering EU27 countries as well as EFTA countries (Norway, Iceland and Switzerland). From this survey, European averages, i.e. foreground data, have been calculated for the direct inputs and outputs of the various aluminium processes. Using the GaBi software, the foreground data have been combined within LCI models integrating background LCI data on energy supply systems, ancillary processes and materials. For the primary aluminium production (smelters), a specific model for the electricity production has been developed. The methodology for the data consolidation and for the development of the various models is explained as well as the main differences between the new modelling approach and LCI models used in the past. An independent expert has critically reviewed the entire LCI project including data collection, models development, calculation of LCI data and associated environmental indicators. Results: As confirmed by the critical review, the new LCI datasets for aluminium ingot production and transformation into semi-finished products have been developed though a robust methodology in full accordance with ISO 14040 and 14044. Most significant environmental data and LCI results are reported in this paper with an emphasis on energy use and the major emissions to air. The full environmental report, including the critical review report and the calculation of environmental indicators for a pre-set of impact categories, is available on the website of the European Aluminium Association (EAA 2008). Whenever possible, the updated European averages and the new LCI data are compared with previous results developed from two past European surveys covering respectively the years 2002 and 1998. For the aluminium processes related to primary production, European averages are also benchmarked against global averages calculated from two worldwide surveys covering the years 2000 and 2005. Discussion: While some data evolutions are directly attributed to the variation of foreground data, e.g. raw materials consumption or energy use within the aluminium processes, modifications related to the system boundaries, the background data and the modelling hypotheses can also influence significantly the LCI results. For primary aluminium production, the evolution of the foreground data is dominated by the strong decrease of PFC (perfluorocarbon) emissions (about 70% since 1998). In addition, the electricity structure calculated from the refined electricity model shows significant differences compared to previous models. In the 2005 electricity model, the hydropower share reaches 58% while coal contributes to 15% only of the electricity production. In 1998, the respective share of coal-based and hydro-electricity were respectively calculated to 25% and 52%. As a result, the electricity background LCI data are then significantly affected and influence also positively the environmental profile of primary aluminium in Europe. For the semi-production processes, the reduction of process scrap production, especially for extrusion and foil, demonstrates the increase of process efficiency from 1998. In parallel, a significant reduction of energy use is observed between 1998 and 2005. However, this positive trend is not fully reflected within LCI data due to the significant contribution of the background electricity data. The choice of the electricity model plays also a critical role for these transformation processes since electricity production contributes to about 2/3 of the consumption of the non-renewable energy and to about the same level of the air emissions. In such a case, the move from the UCPTE electricity model used in the past towards the EU25 electricity model used for the development of the updated LCI data has a detrimental effect on the environmental profile of the three LCI datasets respectively related to sheet, foil and extrusion. In addition to energy and process scrap reduction, the reduction of the VOC (volatile organic compounds) emission is also a major trend in foil production. Finally, for old aluminium scrap recycling, the new LCI data show a dramatic improvement regarding energy efficiency, reinforcing the environmental soundness of promoting and supporting aluminium recycling within the aluminium product life cycles. Conclusions: This paper shows the development of generic LCI data about aluminium production and transformation processes which are based on robust data, methodologies and models in full accordance with ISO 14040 and 14044 standards, as confirmed by the critical review. The publishing of these LCI datasets definitely shows the commitment of the European aluminium industry to contribute in a transparent, fair and scientifically sound manner to product sustainability in a life cycle thinking perspective. Recommendations and perspectives: Software houses and LCA practitioners are invited to update their generic European data on aluminium with the herewith datasets. Even if the quality and the completeness of these LCI data reach a high standard, some areas for data improvements have been identified, as described within the review report. Land use, water use and solid waste treatment appear as three priority areas for data refining and improvement. The land use dimension, particularly meaningful for bauxite mining, is not covered in the current LCI data while it is now integrated within many LCA studies. Up to now, the reporting of meaningful and robust data on water origins and use have not been possible due to the huge discrepancies between the surveyed sites combined with the difficulty to report coherent input and output water mass flows. The development of water data, only focussing on water-stressed areas, will most probably make more sense in the future. Finally, collecting more qualitative information about solid waste processing and treatment will help to include such operations within the system boundaries and to model their associated air, water and soil emissions. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Aluminium; Europe; Extrusion; Foil; Generic LCI data; Primary production; Recycling; Sheet,alloy; aluminum; aluminum oxide; carbon; aluminum factory; aluminum foil; article; combustion; electricity; electrolysis; environmental economics; life cycle assessment; priority journal; recycling,
Surface characteristics of indium tin oxide deposited by facing target sputtering and its effect on the performance of organic light emitting diode,"Yoon C., Kim S.-H.",2009,Current Applied Physics,"A new facing target sputtering (FTS) method that has two facing targets and substrate locates vertically to the targets was used for ITO anode deposition in OLED. The ITO different from it by a conventional DC or RF magnetron sputtering was optimized in crystallinity, grain morphology, surface roughness and oxygen content by plasma treatment, and the effect on the OLED I-V characteristic was identified. Crystallinity of ITO was improved with a short plasma treatment time less than 15 min. The grains were an equi-axed as deposited state and changed to columnar grains when the plasma treatment time was exceeded above 20 min. The surface roughness was maintained within the targeted 1.8-2.0 nm range with plasma treatment from 5 to 20 min. Oxygen content measured using XPS analysis was increased with 15 min plasma treatment during the ITO grains maintained an equi-axed, but it was decreased again with 25 min plasma treatment. The I-V characteristic of OLED was relatively good with 15 min plasma treatment. It was considered because the ITO anode can contain higher oxygen in equi-axed grains, and can have better crystallinity and relevant surface roughness by 15 min plasma treatment. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.",Facing target sputtering; ITO; OLED; Oxygen content; Plasma treatment; Surface roughness,Facing target sputtering; ITO; OLED; Oxygen content; Plasma treatment; Descaling; Facings; Helmet mounted displays; Light emitting diodes; Magnetron sputtering; Metal analysis; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED); Oxygen; Physical optics; Plasma applications; Plasma diagnostics; Plasmas; Surface morphology; Surface properties; Surface roughness; Targets; Tin; Surface treatment,
"Chemical analysis and quality control of Ginkgo biloba leaves, extracts, and phytopharmaceuticals","van Beek T.A., Montoro P.",2009,Journal of Chromatography A,"The chemical analysis and quality control of Ginkgo leaves, extracts, phytopharmaceuticals and some herbal supplements is comprehensively reviewed. The review is an update of a similar, earlier review in this journal [T.A. van Beek, J. Chromatogr. A 967 (2002) 21-55]. Since 2001 over 3000 papers on Ginkgo biloba have appeared, and about 400 of them pertain to chemical analysis in a broad sense and are cited herein. The more important ones are discussed and, where relevant, compared with the best methods published prior to 2002. In the same period over 2500 patents were filed on Ginkgo and the very few related to analysis are mentioned as well. Important constituents include terpene trilactones, i.e. ginkgolide A, B, C, J and bilobalide, flavonol glycosides, biflavones, proanthocyanidins, alkylphenols, simple phenolic acids, 6-hydroxykynurenic acid, 4-O-methylpyridoxine and polyprenols. In the most common so-called ""standardised"" Ginkgo extracts and phytopharmaceuticals several of these classes are no longer present. About 130 new papers deal with the analysis of the terpene trilactones. They are mostly extracted with methanol or water or mixtures thereof. Supercritical fluid extraction and pressurised water extraction are also possible. Sample clean-up is mostly by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate although no sample clean-up at all in combination with LC/MS/MS is gaining in importance. Separation and detection can be routinely carried out by RP-HPLC with ELSD, RI or MS, or by GC/FID or GC/MS after silylation. Hydrolysis followed by LC/MS allows the simultaneous analysis of terpene trilactones and flavonol aglycones. No quantitative procedure for all major flavonol glycosides has yet been published because they are not commercially available. The quantitation of a few available glycosides has been carried out but does not serve a real purpose. After acidic hydrolysis to the aglycones quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin and separation by HPLC, quantitation is straightforward and yields by recalculation an estimation of the original total flavonol glycoside content. A profile of the genuine flavonol glycosides can detect poor storage or adulteration. Although the toxicity of Ginkgo alkylphenols upon oral administration has never been undoubtedly proven, most suppliers limit their content in extracts to 5 ppm and dozens of papers on their analysis were published. One procedure in which a methanolic extract is directly injected on a C8 HPLC column appears superior in terms of sensitivity (<5 ppm), separation, simplicity and validation and will be incorporated in the European Pharmacopoeia. Alternatively GC/MS and ELISA methods can be used. A sharp contrast to the plethora of papers on terpene trilactones, flavonol glycosides, and ginkgolic acids forms the low number of papers on biflavones, proanthocyanidins, simple phenolics, simple acids, and other constituents that make up the remaining 70% of Ginkgo standardised extracts. More research in this direction is clearly needed. For the analysis of Ginkgo proanthocyanidins (7%) for instance, no reliable assays are yet existing. Finally the growing literature on pharmacokinetic and fingerprinting studies of Ginkgo is briefly summarised. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Recent insights into the role of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPIV) and aminopeptidase N (APN) families in immune functions,"Ansorge S., Bank U., Heimburg A., Helmuth M., Koch G., Tadje J., Lendeckel U., Wolke C., Neubert K., Faust J., Fuchs P., Reinhold D., Thielitz A., Täger M.",2009,Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine,"Background: In the past, different research groups could show that treatment of immune cells with inhibitors of post-proline splitting dipeptidyl aminopeptidases leads to functional changes in the immune system consistent with immunosuppression. This is due to the inhibition of proliferation of lymphocytes and the production of inflammatory cytokines of the TH1, TH2, and TH17 cells as well as the induction of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and interleukin (IL)-1RA. Until recently, most of the effects of these inhibitors on immune functions were attributed to the inhibition of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPIV/CD26). With the identification of new peptidases of the DPIV family (DASH) with the same or similar substrate specificity [fibroblast activation protein (FAP), DP8/9], the question arose whether and to what extent the inhibition of intracellularly localized enzymes, DP8 and DP9, contribute to the observed immunosuppression. In addition, members of the aminopeptidase N (APN) family are also involved in the regulation of immune functions. Hence, the concept of a combined targeting of both families of peptidases for treatment of inflammatory diseases is a promising strategy. Results/Conclusions: Summarizing data obtained from the usage of different non-selective and selective inhibitors of DPIV, DP8/9, FAP, and DPII, this review provides evidence that in addition to DPIV, DP8/9 also regulate the immune response via modulation of cell cycle progression and cytokine production. The strongest and most consistent effects in vitro were, however, observed with non-selective inhibitors for the suppression of DNA synthesis and cytokine production. Similar effects were provoked by APN inhibitors, which were also found to suppress DNA synthesis and the production of inflammatory cytokines in vitro. However, different mechanisms and signaling pathways appear to mediate the cellular effects resulting from the inhibition of either APN or DPIV family members. In particular, members of the APN family uniquely influence the function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cells. Consequently, the concomitant inhibition of both APN and DPIV enzyme families by means of two separate inhibitors or by binary inhibitors with specificity for both enzyme families (PETIR™, peptidase targeted immunoregulation) synergistically affects immune cells on the level of cell cycle regulation, suppression of TH1, TH2, and TH17 cytokines as well as the activation of regulatory T-cells. Besides leukocytes, dermal cells as sebocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts are also targeted by these inhibitors. This strongly suggests a broad potential of the multiple anti-inflammatory effects of PETIR™ in treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, allergies, and transplant rejections, as well as of inflammatory skin diseases, such as acne, psoriasis, rosacea or atopic dermatitis. The first active dual inhibitor, IP10.C8, has been developed by IMTM for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases and has just entered the first phase II study. © 2009 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin New York.",Aminopeptidase N (APN); Cytokines; Dermal diseases; Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV); DPIV-like enzymes; Immune system; Inflammatory diseases; PETIR™,"dipeptidyl peptidase; dipeptidyl peptidase 8; dipeptidyl peptidase 9; dipeptidyl peptidase IV; fibroblast activation protein; interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; microsomal aminopeptidase; serine proteinase; transforming growth factor beta1; unclassified drug; CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocyte; cell cycle progression; cell proliferation; cytokine production; DNA synthesis; enzyme inhibition; enzyme localization; enzyme specificity; fibroblast; immune response; inflammatory disease; keratinocyte; lymphocyte; nonhuman; priority journal; review; signal transduction; skin inflammation; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; tissue distribution; Animals; Antigens, CD13; Antigens, CD26; Humans; Protease Inhibitors; Skin Diseases",
Characterization of two soil metagenome-derived lipases with high specificity for p-nitrophenyl palmitate,"Wei P., Bai L., Song W., Hao G.",2009,Archives of Microbiology,"Two novel genes (pwtsB and pwtsC) encoding lipases were isolated by screening the soil metagenomic library. Sequence analysis revealed that pwtsB encodes a protein of 301 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 33 kDa, and pwtsC encodes a protein of 323 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 35 kDa. Furthermore, both genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using pET expression system. The expressed recombinant enzymes were purified by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and characterized by spectrophotometric with different p-nitrophenyl esters. The results showed that PWTSB displayed a high degree of activity and stability at 20°C with an optimal pH of around 8.0, and PWTSC at 40°C with an optimal pH of around 7.0. P-nitrophenyl palmitate (p-NPP) was identified as the best substrate of PWTSB and PWTSC. The specific activities of PWTSB and PWTSC were 150 and 166 U/mg, respectively toward p-NPP at 30°C, about 20-fold higher than that toward p-nitrophenyl butyrate (C4) and caprylate (C8). In conclusion, our results suggest that PWTSB is a cold adapt lipase and PWTSC is a thermostable lipase to long-chain p-nitrophenyl esters. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Lipase; Metagenomic library; PWTSB; PWTSC,"bacterial DNA; bacterial enzyme; benzene derivative; butyric acid derivative; esterase; metal ion; octanoic acid derivative; palmitic acid 4 nitrophenyl ester; recombinant enzyme; triacylglycerol lipase; unclassified drug; 4-nitrophenyl palmitate; bacterial DNA; palmitic acid 4 nitrophenyl ester; palmitic acid derivative; recombinant protein; article; DNA library; DNA sequence; enzyme activity; enzyme specificity; enzyme stability; Escherichia coli; gene; gene overexpression; metagenomics; molecular cloning; Moraxella; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; pH; priority journal; Psychrobacter immobilis; pwtsB gene; pwtsC gene; Streptomyces coelicolor; thermostability; amino acid sequence; bacterial genome; gene library; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; molecular genetics; sequence alignment; temperature; Amino Acid Sequence; DNA, Bacterial; Enzyme Stability; Escherichia coli; Gene Library; Genome, Bacterial; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Lipase; Molecular Sequence Data; Palmitates; Recombinant Proteins; Sequence Alignment; Soil Microbiology; Substrate Specificity; Temperature; Escherichia coli",
Air at hydrophobic surfaces and kinetics of three phase contact formation,"Krasowska M., Zawala J., Malysa K.",2009,Advances in Colloid and Interface Science,"This review focuses on the importance of air presence at hydrophobic solid surfaces for wetting film rupture and kinetics of three phase contact formation. Affinity to air is a typical feature of hydrophobic surfaces, but it has been often either overlooked or not taken into consideration. When the hydrophobic surface, contacted earlier with air, is immersed into water then air can stay attached to the surface. The origin of long range hydrophobic forces and data showing that these interactions were due to the bridging of nanobubbles attached to the hydrophobic surfaces are discussed. A major part of the review is devoted to the description and analysis of data showing that air (nano-, micro-bubbles and/or air film) present at a hydrophobic surface facilitated rupture of the liquid film and three phase contact formation during bubble collisions with flat Teflon plates of different surface roughness. Although all Teflon plates were highly hydrophobic (contact angles ca. 100°-130°) the time of the three phase contact (TPC) formation and attachment of the colliding bubble was strongly affected by the plate surface roughness. The time of the TPC formation was shortened from over 80 down to 2-3 ms when the roughness was increased from below 1 μm to over 50 μm. Higher surface roughness means that larger amounts of air was entrapped during the Teflon plates' immersion in water. Additional experimental evidence is given, showing that facilitation of the TPC formation and the bubble attachment was due to air presence and re-distribution over the Teflon surfaces: i) prolonging the plate immersion time resulted in quicker attachment; ii) irregular and disappearing air pockets were recorded at a Teflon surface; iii) a satellite bubble left at a Teflon surface during the first collision facilitated the attachment; iv) attachment always occurred during the first collision in the case of a very rough ""Teflon V"" surface, but in highly concentrated n-octanol and n-heptanol solutions there was bouncing and attachment occurred during the second collision, moreover; v) the degree of bubble kinetic energy transferred into surface energy was significantly smaller during collisions with hydrophobic (Teflon) surfaces than with the hydrophilic ones. The mechanism of air entrapment and redistribution over Teflon plates immersed in water is presented. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Investigation of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs in fish from the southern Baltic Sea during the 2002-2006 period,"Szlinder-Richert J., Barska I., Usydus Z., Ruczyńska W., Grabic R.",2009,Chemosphere,"Concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) in the southern Baltic herring (Clupea harengus), sprat (Sprattus sprattus), and salmon (Salmo salar) are reported. The significant interspecies and season-specific differences in PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs concentrations were observed. The contribution of dl-PCBs to the total toxicity equivalents (TEQs) ranged between 50% and 70%, dependently on fish species. In all samples, concentrations of PCDF were higher in comparison with that of PCDD. The permissible limits of the content of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs (8 pg g-1 fresh weight for the sum of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs, and 4 pg g-1 fresh weight for the PCDD/Fs) were exceeded mainly in salmon samples (in 80% of salmon samples studied). The elevated levels of PCDD/F and dl-PCB were observed only in two of seventy two herring samples, and in ten of 62 sprat samples. The multiple regression analysis revealed that fish lipid content, and concentration of PCB 153, used simultaneously, might be useful in the prediction of TEQ values of fish samples. These two variables explained more than 80% of total variance. For all fish species studied, the correlation coefficients obtained with the multiple regression analysis were higher than that obtained with the regression analysis involving total TEQ values, and only one independent variable: fish lipid content. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of pre-treatment on physico-chemical properties and stability of carbon nanotubes supported iron Fischer-Tropsch catalysts,"Malek Abbaslou R.M., Tavasoli A., Dalai A.K.",2009,Applied Catalysis A: General,"This paper presents the effects of acid treatment on the activity, product selectivity and life span of iron Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysts supported on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Two different types of CNTs with low surface area (∼25 m2/g) and high surface area (∼170 m2/g) were prepared and treated with 35 wt% HNO3 at 25 °C and 110 °C for 16 h. Fe/CNTs were prepared using incipient wetness impregnation method with iron loading of 10 wt%. The CNT supports and catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption, ICP, TPR, XRD, SEM, TEM and Raman spectroscopy. The acid treatments at 25 °C and 110 °C increased the BET surface area by 18% and 31%. The results of Raman analysis revealed that the acid treatment increased the number of defects which are considered as anchoring site for metal particles. TEM analysis showed that the major parts of the iron particles were homogenously distributed inside the acid treated nanotubes. According to the XRD analysis, the acid treatment on both families of CNTs resulted in decrease in metal particle sizes. The FT synthesis was carried out in a fixed-bed microreactor (275 °C, 2 MPa, CO/H2 = 2) for 120 h. Among the catalysts studied, Fe catalyst supported on pre-treated CNTs at 110 °C was stable and active while, the other catalysts experienced rapid deactivations. The Fe catalyst supported on CNTs low surface area and larger diameter showed much lower CH4 and higher C5+ selectivities. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Adsorbed serum albumin is permissive to macrophage attachment to perfluorocarbon polymer surfaces in culture,"Godek M.L., Michel R., Chamberlain L.M., Castner D.G., Grainger D.W.",2009,Journal of Biomedical Materials Research - Part A,"Monocyte/macrophage adhesion to biomaterials, correlated with foreign body response, occurs through protein-mediated surface interactions. Albumin-selective perfluorocarbon (FC) biomaterials are generally poorly cell-conducive because of insufficient receptor-mediated surface interactions, but macrophages bind to albumin-coated substrates and also preferentially to highly hydrophobic fluorinated surfaces. Bone marrow macrophages (BMMO) and IC-21, RAW 264.7, and J774A.1 monocyte/macrophage cells were cultured on FC surfaces. Protein deposition onto two distinct FC surfaces from complex and single-component solutions was tracked using fluorescence and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) methods. Cell adhesion and growth on protein pretreated substrates were compared by light microscopy. Flow cytometry and integrin-directed antibody receptor blocking were used to assess integrins critical for monocyte/macrophage adhesion in vitro. Albumin predominantly adsorbs onto both FC surfaces from 10% serum. In cultures preadsorbed with albumin or serum-dilutions, BMMO responded similar to IC-21 at early time points. Compared with Teflon® AF, plasma-polymerized FC was less permissive to extended cell proliferation. The β2 integrins play major roles in macrophage adhesion to FC surfaces: antibody blocking significantly disrupted cell adhesion. Albumin-mediated cell adhesion mechanisms to FC surfaces could not be clarified. Primary BMMO and secondary IC-21 macrophages behave similarly on FC surfaces, regardless of preadsorbed protein biasing, with respect to adhesion, cell morphology, motility, and proliferation. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Cell line; Foreign body reaction; Integrin blocking; Perfluorocarbon; Serum proteins,"Cell line; Foreign body reaction; Integrin blocking; Perfluorocarbon; Serum proteins; Adhesion; Biological materials; Body fluids; Cell adhesion; Cell growth; Cell proliferation; Clarification; Flow cytometry; Flow interactions; Glycoproteins; High performance liquid chromatography; Inductively coupled plasma; Macrophages; Mass spectrometry; Proteins; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Cell culture; beta2 integrin; fluorocarbon; serum albumin; adsorption; animal cell; article; cell adhesion; cell culture; cell growth; cell motility; cell proliferation; cell structure; comparative study; controlled study; dilution; enzyme substrate; flow cytometry; fluorescence; in vitro study; macrophage; mass spectrometry; microscopy; monocyte; mouse; nonhuman; surface property; systematic review; time of flight mass spectrometry; Adsorption; Animals; Biocompatible Materials; Bone Marrow Cells; Cell Adhesion; Cell Proliferation; Cell Shape; Cells, Cultured; Fibronectins; Fluorocarbons; Integrins; Macrophages; Mass Spectrometry; Materials Testing; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Polymers; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Principal Component Analysis; Serum Albumin",
Influence of silicone surface roughness and hydrophobicity on adhesion and colonization of Staphylococcus epidermidis,"Tang H., Cao T., Liang X., Wang A., Salley S.O., McAllister II J., Ng K.Y.S.",2009,Journal of Biomedical Materials Research - Part A,"Bacterial adhesion and colonization are complicated processes that depend on many factors, including surface chemistry, hydrophobicity, and surface roughness. The contribution of each of these factors has not been fully elucidated because most previous studies used different polymeric surfaces to achieve differences in properties. The objective of this study was to modify hydrophobicity and roughness on one polymeric surface, eliminating the confounding contribution of surface chemistry. Mechanically assembled monolayer (MAM) preparation methods (both one- and two-dimensional) were used to impart different degrees of hydrophobicity on fluoroalkylsilane (FAS)-coated silicone. Surface roughness was varied by casting the silicone to templates prepared with different abrasives. Surface hydrophobicity was determined by contact angle measurement, whereas surface roughness was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Bacterial adhesion and colonization were analyzed using a direct colony-counting method and SEM images. Hydrophobicity increased as a function of stretched length or width (Δx or Δy); it reached a maximum at Δx = 60% with one-dimensional MAM and decreased as Δx further increased to 80 and 100%. The same trend was observed for the two-dimensional MAM. After 12-h incubation, all the FAS/silicone surfaces had significantly reduced adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis by 42-89%, compared to untreated silicone, and the degree of which is inversely related to surface hydrophobicity. On the other hand, surface roughness had a significant effect on bacterial adhesion and colonization only when the root-mean-square roughness was higher than 200 nm. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Bacterial adhesion; Roughness; Silicone; Surface hydrophobicity,Atomic forces; Bacterial adhesion; Fluoroalkylsilane; Polymeric surfaces; Preparation methods; Roughness; SEM images; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Surface hydrophobicity; Adhesion; Angle measurement; Bacteriology; Capillarity; Contact angle; Friction; Hydrophobicity; Metal analysis; Monolayers; Photoresists; Scanning electron microscopy; Silicones; Surface chemistry; Surface roughness; Two dimensional; Surface properties; fluoroalkylsilane; silane derivative; silicone; unclassified drug; article; atomic force microscopy; bacterial colonization; bacterial count; bacterium adherence; comparative study; controlled study; hydrophobicity; incubation time; material coating; measurement; scanning electron microscopy; Staphylococcus epidermidis; stretching; surface property; Bacterial Adhesion; Biocompatible Materials; Biofilms; Hydrophobicity; Materials Testing; Polymers; Silicones; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Surface Properties,
Supraclavicular brachial plexus block: A comparative clinical study between bupivacaine and levobupivacaine [Bloqueio do plexo braquial por via supraclavicular: Estudo clínico comparativo entre bupivacaína e levobupivacaína],"Pedro J.R.P., Mathias L.A.S.T., Gozzani J.L., Pedro F.S.D.S.P., Rittes J.C.",2009,Revista Brasileira de Anestesiologia,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Brachial plexus block is used in surgical procedures of the upper limbs. The brachial plexus is a potential territory for absorption of local anesthetics. Studies on bupivacaine isomers have shown reduced cardiovascular toxicity of its levorotatory form (levobupivacaine). However, the anesthetic efficacy (sensorial and motor blockades) of levobupivacaine in neuroaxis blocks has been debated. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the anesthetic efficacy of levobupivacaine in brachial plexus block, using the perivascular subclavian approach, by comparing it to racemic bupivacaine. METHODS: Fifty adult patients of both genders, ASA I and II, underwent subclavian perivascular brachial plexus block, with the aid of a peripheral neurostimulator, for orthopedic surgeries of the upper limbs. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: GBUPI - racemic bupivacaine, and GLEVO - levobupivacaine, and they received 30 mL of the 0.5% solution. Sensorial blockade was evaluated by pinprick stimulation from C 5 to C8 metameres; and the motor blockade was assessed 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes after the administration of the local anesthetic or until blockade of fingers, hand, forearm, and arm movements was observed. RESULTS: Statistical differences in latency, failure rate, and degree of the motor blockade, and failure of the sensorial blockade between both groups were not observed, but the latency of the sensorial blockade in all metameres analyzed showed statistically significant differences. Adverse events inherent to the administration of local anesthetics were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: The anesthetic efficacy of levobupivacaine in brachial plexus block was similar to that of the racemic solution commonly used.","Anesthetic technique, regional: brachial plexus block; Anesthetics, local: bupivacaine, levobupivacaine",bupivacaine; levobupivacaine; midazolam; adult; anesthesia induction; anthropometry; article; bone lesion; brachial plexus anesthesia; classification; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical study; controlled study; drug efficacy; female; human; male; nerve stimulation; orthopedic surgery; outcome assessment; patient monitoring; patient positioning; shoulder surgery; soft tissue injury,Elsevier Editora Ltda
Metal Extraction from Water and Organic Solvents into Fluorous Solvents by Fluorinated β-Diketone and Its Application to the Colorimetric Analysis of Metal Ions,"Nakashima K., Maruyama T., Kubota F., Goto M.",2009,Analytical Sciences,"A metal extraction system using fluorous solvents has been developed. Perfluorinated β-diketone, 1,1,1,5,5,6,6,6-octafluoro-2,4-hexanedione (C6F8βDK) dissolves in the fluorous solvent FC-72 and can extract transition metal ions from water into FC-72. The extraction efficiency in the FC-72 system is comparable to that of chloroform. By using the immiscibility of FC-72 with conventional organic solvents, metal extraction was also achieved from acetonitrile and dioxane. Metal ions extracted into FC-72 can be readily stripped using 1 M nitric acid. We succeeded in a colorimetric assay of metal ion concentration in water and in organic solvents by contacting each solvent with FC-72 containing C6F8βDK. Iron ions with different concentrations (0 - 0.1 mM) in water or acetonitrile are completely extracted into FC-72 to form a Fe3+-C6F8βDK complex, which can be detected by spectrophotometry due to its absorption in the UV-vis region. We have demonstrated that fluorous solvents would be promising candidates for a novel separation and analytical medium for metal ions. © 2008 The Japan Society for Analytical Science",,Acetonitrile; Chlorine compounds; Colorimetric analysis; Colorimetry; Ketones; Metal ions; Nitric acid; Organic solvents; Solvent extraction; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Water absorption; Colorimetric assays; Diketones; Extraction efficiencies; Fluorous solvents; Iron ions; ITS applications; Metal extractions; Metal ion concentration; Chemicals removal (water treatment),Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry
Wastewater treatment and emerging pollutants in the environment,"Gilbride K.A., Levinson L.",2008,Water Resources Research Progress,"This review will present clear evidence that the presence of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and hormones in municipal wastewaters is a valid topic of concern, and that great efforts should continue to be made to investigate this realm of scientific thought. Many compounds are excreted by humans and animals, entering the environment after some form of treatment usually through a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Recent monitoring studies have found low-levels of contaminants throughout municipal wastewater treatment processes, beginning with influent wastewater, straight though to receiving waters in the proximity of effluent discharge points. Moreover, the effects and potential risks associated with the persistence of such compounds have been identified in the aquatic environment and beyond. What to do with this information is a complex concern and whether or not alarm bells should be sounding, awakening a silent emergency, is on the forefront of the issue. The evidence presented here will attempt to inspire the position that it would be unscientific, careless and irresponsible to rest on the assumption that the low levels of chemical containments currently present in the environment require little or no action from the community. Can we look to environmental impact studies for some answers? Will documenting the detrimental effects of certain compounds on various aquatic organisms help to defend or vilify this reasoning? The difficulty of this issue is that no clear answers can be made in the face of such simple and clear questions. The truth of the matter is that at this point in time, although the literature is growing and insights are being made, there is purely not enough valuable data available. This review will document the growing literature with respect to the detection and abundance of anthropogenic compounds that enter the environment and the potential risks associated with their eventual presence in drinking water and food products. It will also become evident that extrapolating the effects of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP's) on exposed laboratory animals to humans appears to be inappropriate. It is clear that despite the perceived low priority of many of these compounds, further investigations should be performed in order to better understand the neurological and reproductive modes of actions associated with several of them. Whatever roles the various emerging pollutants in the environment play needs to be firmly established. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.",,,"Nova Science Publishers, Inc."
Fire performance and environmental impact evaluations of communication cable installations with unexpected infrastructure fire-safety implications,"James H., Fred D., Todd K., Steve B., Gary G., Wilmington D.",2008,Proceedings of the AEI 2008 Conference - AEI 2008: Building Integration Solutions,"Changing environmental interests in the wire and cable industry (WCI) have generated studies into the eco-performance of various data and communication cabling system alternatives for computers and local area networks (LAN). To accurately assess the various alternatives, the installed electronic functionality and fire safety performance requirements of the various end-use product options must be equivalent. In buildings, high fire performance (HFP) based polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheathed and perfluoropolymer (PFP) insulated (CMP or PVC/PFP) cables can be routed directly in concealed plenum spaces without the use of additional metal conduit fire protection. Products that do not meet specific high fire-performance criteria, such as low-smoke zero-halogen (LSZH/PE) cables or riser-rated cables (CMR or PVC/PE), often must be protected inside other structures, typically metal EMT conduit or trunking. Life cycle analysis (LCA) via ISO 14040 methodology is used to evaluate cabling alternatives using an appropriate functional unit. Copper wire is identified as a significant contributor to all impact categories, and the major contributor for human toxicity. The burdens for steel conduits dominate all other impact categories studied for systems requiring steel for fire performance code compliance. The additional fire safety and installation advantages provided by the CMP cables offset the environmental burdens associated with the initial manufacture of just the cable. Thus, CMP cables provide superior overall fire safety, environmental performance, and economic benefits versus LSZH/PE and CMR cables installed in metal conduits for U.S. plenum cable installations. During the writing of this paper, new fire safety research became available indicating that EMT die cast conduit-couplings can begin to weaken, melt and fail to fire-protect in less than 4 minutes at or less than 400°C (images to be shown). This finding is not consistent with previous beliefs that the fire performance of CMR or LSZH cable in EMT conduit was equal to the performance of CMP cable. © 2008 ASCE.",CMP; CMR; Communication Cables; Conduit Couplings; EMT; Environmental Burden; HDPE; High Fire Performance Cabling (HFP-Cables); ISO; LAN Cabling; LCA; Life Cycle Analysis; LSZH; PFP; Plenum; PVC; Steel Conduit,CMP; CMR; Conduit Couplings; EMT; Environmental Burden; HDPE; High Fire Performance Cabling (HFP-Cables); ISO; LAN Cabling; LCA; Life Cycle Analysis; LSZH; PFP; Plenum; PVC; Cables; Chlorine compounds; Communication; Computer science; Couplings; Environmental impact; Fires; Installation; Life cycle; Local area networks; Metal analysis; Nanotechnology; Polyvinyl chlorides; Smelting; Steel; Structural metals; Telecommunication cables; Tropical engineering; Wire; Fire protection,

Data acquired by TANSO-FTS (Fourier Transform Spectrometer) and TANSO-CAI (Cloud and Aerosol Imager) on GOSAT (TANSO stands for Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observation) will be collected at Tsukuba Space Center @ JAXA. The level 1A and IB data of FTS (interferogram and spectra, respectively) and the level 1A of CAI (uncorrected data) will be generated at JAXA and will be transferred to GOSAT Data Handling facility (DHF) at NIES for further processing. Radiometric and geometric correction will be applied to CAI L1A data to generate CAI LIB data. From CAI LIB data, cloud coverage and aerosol information (CAI Level 2 data) will be estimated. The FTS data that is recognized to have ""low cloud coverage"" by CAI will be processed to generate column concentration of carbon dioxide CO2 and methane CH4 (FTS Level 2 data). Level 3 data will be ""global map column concentration"" of green house gases averaged in time and space.

A meta-analysis of the impact of the two-layer method of preservation on human pancreatic islet transplantation,"Agrawal A., Gurusamy K., Powis S., Gray D.W., Fuller B., Davidson B.R.",2008,Cell Transplantation,"There are conflicting reports about the effectiveness of perfluorocarbons used in the two-layer method (TLM) of pancreas preservation for human islet transplantation. The mechanism of action is unclear and the optimal role of this method uncertain. The study design was a meta-analysis of the evidence that TLM improves islet isolation outcomes. Pubmed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, and BIOSIS were searched electronically in January 2008. After selecting the relevant human trials for meta-analysis data relating to donor variables, study design, primary and secondary islet isolation outcomes were extracted. Electronic searches identified eight unique citations, describing 11 human studies that were eligible for the meta-analysis. When comparing TLM with preservation in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution, there was a statistically significant higher islet yield [WMD 711.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 140.03-1283.07] in the TLM group. The proportion of transplantable preparations obtained was not significantly different (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.89-1.88) between the two groups. The rate of successful islet isolations for marginal organs was higher in the TLM group (OR 6.69, 95% CI 1.80-24.87). Improved oxygenation and preservation of cellular bioengertics is thought to be the main underlying mechanism, although no single mechanism has yet been confirmed. There is currently no clear evidence that the TLM is beneficial in human islet transplantation. It may improve the preservation of marginal organs. Copyright © 2008 Cognizant Comm.

Meta-iodobenzylguanidine and analogues: Chemistry and biology,Vaidyanathan G.,2008,Quarterly Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging,"Meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a structural analogue of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) and is taken up by cells rich in sympathetic neurons by an active uptake process mediated by the NE transporter, which is referred to as uptake-1. It is a valuable agent in the diagnosis of myocardial abnormalities as well as that of several neuroendocrine tumors such as neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma and carcinoid tumors. MIBG labeled with 131I also is used extensively in the therapy of several neuroendocrine tumors. Over the years, a substantial amount of work has been undertaken to improve its clinical utility. Currently, radio-iodinated MIBG used in the clinic is prepared by an exchange radio-iodination method and, thus, is of low specific activity. For possible better targeting and to ward off pharmacological effects, its preparation at a no-carrier-added level both by solution-phase and solid-phase synthesis has been developed. For potential use in the treatment of micrometastatic diseases, synthesis of an analogue labeled with the a emitter 211At was devised. Development of analogues labeled with positron emitting radionuclides such as 124I, 18F, and 76Br has been reported. Further, efforts have been put in to improve its pharmacokinetic properties by structural modifications.

Detection of ketamine and its metabolites in urine by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry,"Parkin M.C., Turfus S.C., Smith N.W., Halket J.M., Braithwaite R.A., Elliott S.P., Osselton M.D., Cowan D.A., Kicman A.T.",2008,Journal of Chromatography B: Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical and Life Sciences,"Current analytical methods used for screening drugs and their metabolites in biological samples from victims of drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) or other vulnerable groups can lack sufficient sensitivity. The application of liquid chromatography, employing small particle sizes, with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is likely to offer the sensitivity required for detecting candidate drugs and/or their metabolites in urine, as demonstrated here for ketamine. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was performed following extraction of urine (4 mL) using mixed-mode (cation and C8) solid-phase cartridges. Only 20 μL of the 250 μL extract was injected, leaving sufficient volume for other assays important in DFSA cases. Three ion transitions were chosen for confirmatory purposes. As ketamine and norketamine (including their stable isotopes) are available as reference standards, the assay was additionally validated for quantification purposes to study elimination of the drug and primary metabolite following a small oral dose of ketamine (50 mg) in 6 volunteers. Dehydronorketamine, a secondary metabolite, was also analyzed qualitatively to determine whether monitoring could improve retrospective detection of administration. The detection limit for ketamine and norketamine was 0.03 ng/mL and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively, and these compounds could be confirmed in urine for up to 5 and 6 days, respectively. Dehydronorketamine was confirmed up to 10 days, providing a very broad window of detection. © 2008.",Drug facilitated sexual assault; Ketamine; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites,"Amines; Assays; Biomolecules; Body fluids; Chromatographic analysis; Chromatography; High performance liquid chromatography; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometers; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; Organic polymers; Solvent extraction; Spectrometers; Spectrometry; Spectrum analysis; Analytical methods; Biological samples; Candidate drugs; Dehydronorketamine; Detection limits; Drug facilitated sexual assault; Ion transitions; Ketamine; Norketamine; Oral doses; Reference standards; Secondary metabolites; Sexual assaults; Small particle sizes; Stable isotopes; Tandem mass spectrometries; Ultra high pressures; High pressure liquid chromatography; dehydronorketamine; ketamine; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor blocking agent; norketamine; stable isotope; unclassified drug; adult; analytic method; article; controlled study; drug blood level; drug determination; drug elimination; drug excretion; drug structure; female; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human experiment; male; normal human; priority journal; quantitative analysis; solid phase extraction; tandem mass spectrometry; urine; Adult; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Female; Humans; Ketamine; Male; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",
"Materials, fluid dynamics, and solid mechanics aspects of coronary artery stents: A state-of-the-art review",Lewis G.,2008,Journal of Biomedical Materials Research - Part B Applied Biomaterials,"It is well known that, across all populations (based on geographic location, race, ethnicity, age, and sex), coronary artery disease (CAD) is the single most common cause of death. The commonly performed revascularization procedures for the treatment of symptomatic CAD are percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) by itself or followed by the deployment of either a bare-metal stent (BMS) or a drug-eluting stent (DES). In the latter type, a drug that is either embedded in polymeric or nonpolymeric coating(s) on the stent surface or directly attached to the stent surface elutes into the blood stream at a controlled rate over a period of time, typically 14-30 days. Over the years, there has been a steady decline in the use of PTCA and a concomitant sharp increase in the use of stents, with DESs being the predominant choice in the last 3 years. The present contribution represents a critical review of the literature on the materials, fluid dynamics, and solid mechanics aspects of both BMSs and DESs, with special reference to in-stent restenosis and in-stent thrombosis, these being risks that present commonly. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Cardiovascular; Computational fluid dynamics; Finite element analysis; Vascular stents,"Chemotherapy; Cladding (coating); Drug delivery; Drug dosage; Dynamics; Fluid dynamics; Fluid mechanics; Metals; Speed; Blood streams; Coronary artery (CA); Coronary artery disease (CAD); Critical review; Drug-eluting stent; Geographic locations; In-stent restenosis (ISR); Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA); Revascularization; Sharp increase; Solid mechanics; Mechanics; abciximab; acetylsalicylic acid; angiopeptin; biolimus; clopidogrel; dexamethasone; echinomycin; everolimus; fluindostatin; genistein; heparin; hirudin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; immunosuppressive agent; matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor; mycophenolic acid; paclitaxel; pimecrolimus; rapamycin; tacrolimus; thienopyridine derivative; tirofiban; zotarolimus; bare metal stent; coronary stent; drug eluting stent; encapsulation; human; nonhuman; restenosis; review; risk; stent; thrombosis; Angioplasty, Transluminal, Percutaneous Coronary; Coronary Artery Disease; Drug-Eluting Stents; Humans; Stents",
"Detection of Cd, Pb, and Cu in non-pretreated natural waters and urine with thiol functionalized mesoporous silica and Nafion composite electrodes","Yantasee W., Charnhattakorn B., Fryxell G.E., Lin Y., Timchalk C., Addleman R.S.",2008,Analytica Chimica Acta,"Electrochemical sensors have great potential for environmental monitoring of toxic metal ions in waters due to their portability, field-deployability and excellent detection limits. However, electrochemical sensors employing mercury-free approaches typically suffer from binding competition for metal ions and fouling by organic substances and surfactants in natural waters, making sample pretreatments such as wet ashing necessary. In this work, we have developed mercury-free sensors by coating a composite of thiol self-assembled monolayers on mesoporous supports (SH-SAMMS™) and Nafion on glassy-carbon electrodes. With the combined benefit of SH-SAMMS™ as an outstanding metal preconcentrator and Nafion as an antifouling binder, the sensors could detect 0.5 ppb of Pb and 2.5 ppb of Cd in river water, Hanford groundwater, and seawater with a minimal amount of preconcentration time (few minutes) and without any sample pretreatment. The sensor could also detect 2.5 ppb of Cd, Pb, and Cu simultaneously. The electrodes have long service times and excellent single and inter-electrode reproducibility (5% R.S.D. after 8 consecutive measurements). Unlike SAMMS™-carbon paste electrodes, the SAMMS™-Nafion electrodes were not fouled in samples containing albumin and successfully detected Cd in human urine. Other potentially confounding factors affecting metal detection at SAMMS™-Nafion electrodes were studied, including pH effect, transport resistance of metal ions, and detection interference. With the ability to reliably detect low metal concentration ranges without sample pretreatment and fouling, SAMMS™-Nafion composite sensors have the potential to become the next-generation metal analyzers for environmental and bio-monitoring of toxic metals. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.",Cd; Cu; Electrochemical sensor; Nafion; Natural water; Pb; Self-assembled monolayers on mesoporous supports; Thiol; Urine,"Alcohols; Composite materials; Electrochemical sensors; Electrodes; Self assembled monolayers; Mesoporous supports; Nafion; Thiol; Water analysis; albumin; antifouling agent; cadmium; carbon; copper; ground water; lead; mercury; nafion; river water; sea water; silicon dioxide; thiol; article; electrochemical analysis; electrode; priority journal; reliability; reproducibility; sensor; urinalysis; water pollutant; Cadmium; Copper; Electrodes; Fluorocarbon Polymers; Lead; Metals, Heavy; Porosity; Silicon Dioxide; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Water",
Comparison of PFC emission rates for operating and newly started pots at a horizontal stud soderberg smelter,"Dando N., Xu W., Nichols R., Rusche S., Nemier M.",2008,TMS Light Metals,"At many point feed prebake smelters, the definition of an anode effect is ""all time above 8 volts"" (T>8V). In this scenario, all pot operating time in excess of 8 volts is integrated and used to estimate perfluorocarbon (PFC) gas emissions using plant-specific or Tier 2 default PFC coefficients. This definition assumes that all ""T >8V"" is due to actual PFC generating anode effects. In Soderberg potlines, at least two additional scenarios occur that cause long-term (several hour long) pot operations above 8 volts: 1) a sustained rise to 8-10 volts due largely to atypical anode bottom profiles and (2) the ""cut-in"" process when a Soderberg pot is restarted (or newly started) wherein liquid bath is added and the reduction cell is energized. Continuous PFC monitoring was performed on two horizontal stud Soderberg ""cut-in"" pots using either a self-baked anode (from a prior shutdown) or a furnace baked anode. PFCs were generated in significant amounts only during pot operating voltage spikes at the early stages of pot ""cut-in"". No significant PFC emissions were observed at later stages of the ""cut-in"" when pot operating voltage was evolving from 10 volts to normal range (4-6 volts). This data suggests that Soderberg pot cut-ins or operating instabilities could cause overestimation of PFC emissions if included in the anode effect inventory, depending upon plantspecific anode effect duration recording practices. The data observed in this study support a Soderberg anode effect definition of ""time above 9.5 volts,"" or that includes an analysis of the voltage slope term to verify that a true (ore starvation based) anode effect event has actually occurred.",Cut-in; Emissions; Horzontal stud Soderberg; PFC; Pot start; Soderberg,"Air pollution; Aluminum; Aluminum metallography; Containers; Data recording; Electric potential; Functional electric stimulation; Gas emissions; Leakage (fluid); Light metals; Metal analysis; Metals; Microfluidics; Ore analysis; Ores; Photoacoustic effect; Plant shutdowns; Smelting; Studs (structural members); (8 hydroxy quinoline) aluminum; (e ,3e) process; Annual meetings; Anode effect (AE); Early stages; Emission rates (ER); Emissions (asphalt); Liquid baths; Operating time; Operating voltages; Perfluorocarbon (PFC); Perfluorocarbon (PFC) emissions; Potlines; Prebake; reduction cells; Soderberg; Technical sessions; AC generator motors",

Estimated time to complete this activity: 1 hour. The failure of echocardiography to give diagnostically useful information in a significant proportion of patients has led to the development of specific contrast agents to enhance imaging. Suitable contrast media must have the ability to modify ultrasound characteristics, be capable of crossing the pulmonary capillary bed, show stability over the duration of a procedure, offer low blood solubility with low toxicity and be rapidly eliminated. The current generation of ultrasound contrast agents comprises microbubbles of a high molecular-weight gas encapsulated in a shell of phospholipid or protein. A review of the clinical evidence shows that these agents are clinically effective in enhancing echocardiographic imaging. They enable the rescue of failed procedures, often sparing patients from invasive tests, but appear not to add to the burden of side effects. Indeed, the benefits of using contrast agents in stress echocardiography have been recommended in recently published American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. Myocardial contrast echocardiography has now developed to the stage where assessment of myocardial perfusion for the detection of coronary artery disease is possible with the same diagnostic accuracy as radionuclide imaging. However, in comparison with the latter technique, it is less expensive, is more portable, and avoids the use of ionizing radiation. It is precisely the ability of myocardial contrast echocardiography to simultaneously assess function and perfusion at the bedside that has given it a unique role in clinical practice. This review provides an overview of the clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of contrast echocardiography in the assessment of myocardial structure, function, and perfusion. © 2008 American Society of Echocardiography.",Contrast; Echocardiography; Imaging; Microbubbles; Perfusion,albunex; contrast medium; echovist; perfluoropentane; perflutren; sonovue; acute coronary syndrome; angiocardiography; contrast echocardiography; contrast enhancement; coronary artery disease; cost control; diagnostic procedure; diagnostic value; heart function; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle volume; heart muscle; heart perfusion; human; image enhancement; patient safety; practice guideline; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; review; sensitivity analysis; single photon emission computer tomography; stress echocardiography; ultrasound; Clinical Trials as Topic; Contrast Media; Echocardiography; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Image Enhancement,
The role of blood transfusion in the management of upper and lower intestinal tract bleeding,"Hearnshaw S., Travis S., Murphy M.",2008,Best Practice and Research: Clinical Gastroenterology,"Patients with gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage use 13.8% of all red blood cell transfusions in England.

It reviews the indications for transfusion in GI bleeding, the haematological consequences of massive blood loss and massive transfusion, and the importance of managing coagulopathy in bleeding patients. It also looks at the safety and risks of blood transfusion, and provides clinicians with evidence to reduce unnecessary transfusion. Large controlled clinical trials of blood transfusion specifically in GI bleeding are required, along with further research into the use of adjuvant therapies such as recombinant activated factor VIIa.

Are PFCAs bioaccumulative? A critical review and comparison with regulatory criteria and persistent lipophilic compounds,"Conder J.M., Hoke R.A., De Wolf W., Russell M.H., Buck R.C.",2008,Environmental Science and Technology,"Perfluorinated acids, including perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs), and perfluorinated sulfonates (PFASs), are environmentally persistent and have been detected in a variety of wildlife across the globe. The most commonly detected PFAS, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), has been classified as a persistent and bioaccumulative substance. Similarities in chemical structure and environmental behavior of PFOS and the PFCAs that have been detected in wildlife have generated concerns about the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs. Differences between partitioning behavior of perfluorinated acids and persistent lipophilic compounds complicate the understanding of PFCA bioaccumulation and the subsequent classification of the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs according to existing regulatory criteria. Based on available research on the bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids, five key points are highlighted in this review: (1) bioconcentration and bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids are directly related to the length of each compound's fluorinated carbon chain; (2) PFASs are more bioaccumulative than PFCAs of the same fluorinated carbon chain length; (3) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (perfluorooctanoate (PFO) and shorter PFCAs) are not considered bioaccumulative according to the range of promulgated bioaccumulation, ""B"", regulatory criteria of 1000-5000 L/kg; (4) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less have low biomagnification potential in food webs, and (5) more research is necessary to fully characterize the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains (>7 fluorinated carbons), as PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains may exhibit partitioning behavior similar to or greater than PFOS. The bioaccumulation potential of perfluorinated acids with seven fluorinated carbons or less appears to be several orders of magnitude lower than ""legacy"" persistent lipophilic compounds classified as bioaccumulative. Thus, although many PFCAs are environmentally persistent and can be present at detectable concentrations in wildlife, it is clear that PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (including PFO) are not bioaccumulative according to regulatory criteria. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,Bioaccumulation; Biomagnetism; Structure (composition); Lipophilic compounds; Perfluorinated acids; Esters; carbon; carboxylic acid derivative; organic compound; organic matter; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; sulfonic acid derivative; Bioaccumulation; Biomagnetism; Esters; Structure (composition); bioaccumulation; comparative study; environmental legislation; fluorocarbon; food web; organic sulfur compound; partitioning; persistence; wild population; aquatic species; bioaccumulation; chemical structure; fluorination; food web; organic pollution; review; trophic cascade; wildlife; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Fluorocarbons,

Evaluation of a protocol for metabolic profiling studies on human blood plasma by combined ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry: From extraction to data analysis,"Bruce S.J., Jonsson P., Antti H., Cloarec O., Trygg J., Marklund S.L., Moritz T.",2008,Analytical Biochemistry,"The investigation presented here describes a protocol designed to perform high-throughput metabolic profiling analysis on human blood plasma by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS). To address whether a previous extraction protocol for gas chromatography (GC)/MS-based metabolic profiling of plasma could be used for UPLC/MS-based analysis, the original protocol was compared with similar methods for extraction of low-molecular-weight compounds from plasma via protein precipitation. Differences between extraction methods could be observed, but the previously published extraction method was considered the best. UPLC columns with three different stationary phases (C8, C18, and phenyl) were used in identical experimental runs consisting of a total of 60 injections of extracted male and female plasma samples. The C8 column was determined to be the best for metabolic profiling analysis on plasma. The acquired UPLC/MS data of extracted male and female plasma samples was subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Furthermore, a strategy for compound identification was applied here, demonstrating the strength of high-mass-accuracy time-of-flight (TOF)/MS analysis in metabolic profiling. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

"Shoot calcium and magnesium concentrations differ between subtaxa, are highly heritable, and associate with potentially pleiotropic loci in Brassica oleracea","Broadley M.R., Hammond J.P., King G.J., Astley D., Bowen H.C., Meacham M.C., Mead A., Pink D.A.C., Teakle G.R., Hayden R.M., Spracklen W.P., White P.J.",2008,Plant Physiology,"Calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) are the most abundant group II elements in both plants and animals. Genetic variation in shoot Ca and shoot Mg concentration (shoot Ca and Mg) in plants can be exploited to biofortify food crops and thereby increase dietary Ca and Mg intake for humans and livestock. We present a comprehensive analysis of within-species genetic variation for shoot Ca and Mg, demonstrating that shoot mineral concentration differs significantly between subtaxa (varietas). We established a structured diversity foundation set of 376 accessions to capture a high proportion of species-wide allelic diversity within domesticated Brassica oleracea, including representation of wild relatives (C genome, 1n = 9) from natural populations. These accessions and 74 modern F1 hybrid cultivars were grown in glasshouse and field environments. Shoot Ca and Mg varied 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively, and was typically not inversely correlated with shoot biomass, within most subtaxa. The closely related capitata (cabbage) and sabauda (Savoy cabbage) subtaxa consistently had the highest mean shoot Ca and Mg. Shoot Ca and Mg in glasshouse-grownplants was highly correlated with data from the field. To understand and dissect the genetic basis of variation in shoot Ca and Mg, we studied homozygous lines from a segregating B. oleracea mapping population. Shoot Ca and Mg was highly heritable (up to 40%). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for shoot Ca and Mg were detected on chromosomes C2, C6, C7, C8, and, in particular, C9, where QTL accounted for 14% to 55% of the total genetic variance. The presence of QTL on C9 was substantiated by scoring recurrent backcross substitution lines, derived from the same parents. This also greatly increased the map resolution, with strong evidence that a 4-cM region on C9 influences shoot Ca. This region corresponds to a 0.41-Mb region on Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) chromosome 5 that includes 106 genes. There is also evidence that pleiotropic loci on C8 and C9 affect shoot Ca and Mg. Map-based cloning of these loci will reveal how shoot-level phenotypes relate to Ca 2+ and Mg2+ uptake and homeostasis at the molecular level. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Animalia; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Brassica oleracea; Brassica oleracea var. capitata; Capitata; calcium; magnesium; article; biomass; Brassica; gene; genetic linkage; genetics; metabolism; plant; quantitative trait locus; Biomass; Brassica; Calcium; Genes, Plant; Linkage (Genetics); Magnesium; Plant Shoots; Quantitative Trait Loci",American Society of Plant Biologists
New fire hazard and environmental burden evaluations of electrical cable installations utilizing ISO 14040 environmental methodologies,"Krieger T., Barr S., Hoover J., Dawson F.",2007,"56th IWCS Conference - Proceedings of the International Wire and Cable Symposium, Inc., IWCS 2007","Changing environmental interests and new fire safety performance concerns in the wire and cable industry (WCI) have generated studies into the fire hazard and eco-performance of various data and communication cabling system altenatives for computers and local area networks (LAN). To accurately assess the various alternatives, the installed electronic functionality and fire safety performance requirements of the various end-use product options must be equivalent. For high fire performance communication cables (HFP-cables), many existing local and national regulations differentiate between end product performance options and building fire protection needs. High fire-performance, high societal-value based PVC sheathed and perfluoropolymer (PFP) insulated (PVC/PFP) cables can be routed directly in concealed plenum spaces in buildings, while products that do not meet specific high fire performance criteria, such as low-smoke zero-halogen (LSZH/PE) cables or riser-rated cables (CMR or PVC/PE), often must be protected inside other structures that do meet these building fire standards, typically using steel conduit or trunking. However, some low fire performance LAN cables, even fire-protected inside steel conduits, failed to meet the minimum flame spread and smoke criteria that HFP-cables must meet in real-scale cable fire tests at BRE/FRS and Underwriters Laboratories (when tested as a cable in steel conduit system) [10]. Life cycle analysis (LCA) via ISO 14040 methodology is used to evaluate the various cabling alternatives using an appropriate functional unit; a CAT 6 communication LAN cabling system in a typical office building, including cable, steel conduit, couplings and supports as required per building codes for the installation. Key environmental impact assessments for energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and human toxicity are all shown to favor the PVC/PFP systems once the steel conduit is included in the analysis to fire-protect the LSZH/PE or PVC/PE cables. The additional fire safety and installation advantages provided by the PVC/PFP cables more than offsets for the environmental burdens associated with the initial manufacture of just the cable, thereby providing superior overall fire safety, environmental performance, and economic benefits versus LSZH/PE and PVC/PE cables in steel conduits.",CMP; CMR; Communication cables; Environmental burden; HDPE; High fire performance cabling (HFP-cables); LAN cabling; Life cycle analysis; LSZH; PFP; PVC; Steel conduit,CMP; CMR; Environmental burden; HDPE; High fire performance cabling (HFP-cables); LAN cabling; Life cycle analysis; LSZH; PFP; PVC; Building codes; Buildings; Cables; Computer science; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Fire hazards; Fireproofing; Fires; Firing (of materials); Flammability testing; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Installation; Leakage (fluid); Life cycle; Local area networks; Metal analysis; Office buildings; Plastic products; Smoke; Steel; Telecommunication cables; Tropical engineering; Wire; Fire protection,
Development of GOSAT ground data system at NIES and data processing strategy,"Watanabe H., Ishihara H., Ninomiya K., Hiraki K., Matsunaga T., Yokota T.",2007,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"GOSAT Project is a joint project of MOE (Ministry of the Environment), JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and NIES (National Institute for Environmental Studies). Data acquired by TANSO-FTS (Fourier Transform Spectrometer) and TANSO-CAI (Cloud and Aerosol Imager) on GOSAT will be collected at Tsukuba Space Center at JAXA. The level 1A and 1B data of FTS (interferogram and spectra, respectively) and the level 1A of CAI (uncorrected data) will be generated at JAXA and will be transferred to GOSAT Data Handling facility (DHF) at NIES for further processing. Radiometric and geometric correction will be applied to CAI L1A data to generate CAI L1B data. From CAI L1B data, cloud coverage and aerosol information (CAI Level 2 data) will be estimated. The FTS data that is recognized to have ""low cloud coverage"" by CAI will be processed to generate column amount of carbon dioxide CO2 and methane CH4 (FTS Level 2 data). Level 3 data will be ""global map column amount"" of green house gases averaged in time and space. Level 4 data will be global distribution of carbon source/sink model and re-calculated forward model estimated by inverse model. Major data flow will be also described. The Critical Design Review of the DHF was completed in the end of July of 2007 to prepare the scheduled launch of GOSAT in December 2008.

Fluorinated liquid crystals – properties and applications,Hird M.,2007,Chemical Society Reviews,"This critical review begins with a brief, but essential, introduction to the special nature of liquid crystal materials, their peculiar properties, and their commercial applications, followed by an introductory insight into the remarkable nature of the fluoro substituent, and its fascinating influence on the properties of organic compounds. However, the main focus of the review is to discuss the enormous amount of exciting research on fluorinated liquid crystals that has been reported. The small size of the fluoro substituent enables its incorporation into all types of liquid crystal, including calamitic, discotic, banana, lyotropic, and polymers, without ruining the liquid crystalline nature of the material. However the fluoro substituent is larger than hydrogen, and hence causes a significant steric effect, which combined with the high polarity, confers many fascinating, and often remarkable, modifications to melting point, mesophase morphology and transition temperatures, and the many other very important physical properties, such as dielectric anisotropy, optical anisotropy, and visco-elastic properties. There are many different positions within a liquid crystal structure where a fluoro substituent can be located, including (i) a terminal position, (ii) within a terminal chain, as a semi-fluorinated or as a perfluorinated chain, or as one fluoro substituent at a chiral centre, (iii) as part of a linking group, and (iv) a lateral position in the core section. Such variety enables the interesting and advantageous tailoring of properties, both for the fundamental purposes of establishing structure–property relationships, and for materials targeted towards commercially-successful liquid crystal display applications. © 2007 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,
Investigation of biofilm formation in clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus,"Cassat J.E., Lee C.Y., Smeltzer M.S.",2007,Methods in Molecular Biology,"As with many other bacterial species, the most commonly used method to assess staphylococcal biofilm formation in vitro is the microtiter plate assay. This assay is particularly useful for comparison of multiple strains including large-scale screens of mutant libraries. When such screens are applied to the coagulase-negative staphylococci in general, and Staphylococcus epidermidis in particular, they are relatively straightforward by comparison with microtiter plate assays used to assess biofilm formation in other bacterial species. However, in the case of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, we have found it necessary to employ specific modifications including precoating of the wells of the microtiter plate with plasma proteins and supplementation of the medium with both salt and glucose. In this chapter, we describe the microtiter plate assay in the specific context of clinical isolates of S. aureus and the use of these modifications. A second in vitro method, which also is generally dependent on coating with plasma proteins and supplementation of the growth medium, is the use of flow cells. In this method, bacteria are allowed to attach to a surface and then monitored with respect to their ability to remain attached to the substrate and differentiate into mature biofilms under the constant pressure of fluid shear force. Although flow cells are not applicable to large-scale screens, we have found that they provide a more reproducible and accurate assessment of the capacity of S. aureus clinical isolates to form a biofilm. They also provide a means of analyzing structural differences in biofilm architecture and isolating bacteria and/or spent media for analysis of physiological and metabolic changes associated with the adaptive response to growth in a biofilm. While a primary focus of this chapter is on the use of in vitro assays to assess biofilm formation in clinical isolates of 5'. aureus, it is important to emphasize two additional considerations. First, it has become increasingly evident that biofilm formation in S. epiderimidis and S. aureus is not equivalent. Additionally, to date, most studies with S. aureus have been done with a very limited number of strains, almost all of which are derived from the NCTC strain designated 8325, and we have found that these strains are not representative of the most relevant clinical isolates. As with the specific elements of our flow cell system, we have written this chapter to reflect our focus on clinical isolates of S. aureus and the specific methods that we have found most reliable in that context. Second, as is often the case, in vitro methods do not necessarily reflect events that occur in vivo. Several in vivo methods to assess biofilm, formation have been described, and these generally fall into one of two categories. The first focuses directly on staphylococcal diseases that are generally thought to include a biofilm component (e.g., endocarditis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis). A discussion of these models is also beyond the scope of this chapter, but examples are easily found in the staphylococcal literature. The second approach uses some form of implanted device in an attempt to focus more directly on implant-associated biofilms. We use a model in which a small piece of Teflon catheter is implanted subcutaneously in mice and used as a substrate for colonization. We have the advantage of using bioluminescent derivatives of S. aureus clinical isolates and the IVIS® imaging system. However, because this system, is not generally available, we restrict technical comments in this chapter to our use of an implanted catheter model evaluated by direct microbiological analysis of explanted catheters (2). © Humana Press Inc.",Flow cell; Implant-associated biofilm; Microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules; Poly-N-acetyl glucosamine; Polysaccharide intercellular adhesin,"animal; article; bacterium adherence; biofilm; growth, development and aging; human; instrumentation; isolation and purification; methodology; microbiological examination; microbiology; mouse; pathogenicity; physiology; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus infection; Animals; Bacterial Adhesion; Bacteriological Techniques; Biofilms; Humans; Mice; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus aureus; Bacteria (microorganisms); Mus; Staphylococcus; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus epidermidis",
Particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) from different areas of Puerto Rico,"Gioda A., Peréz U., Rosa Z., Jimenez-Velez B.D.",2007,Fresenius Environmental Bulletin,"Fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10) particles were characterized in different sites of Puerto Rico during 2000 to 2003. The sites were established in urban areas (Guaynabo, Salinas and Vieques) and in a reference site (Fajardo) at the east coast. Particulate matter (PM) samples were collected in Teflon and quartz filters then weighed and processed. PM mass concentrations in Teflon filter were determined gravimetrically and estimated for quartz. Samples were digested for metal analyses with appropriate field blanks. Seven to eight metals (Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, V and Zn) plus arsenic (As) were analyzed in each sample by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. Average PM10 levels were around 25 μg m-3 in all sites being, lower than the limits established by USEPA (50 μg m-3). The annual average level of PM2.5 in Guaynabo was 11.6 μg m-3 versus 8.5 μg m-3 in Fajardo. Most of the metals were present at higher levels in the urban sites (Guaynabo, Vieques and Salinas) than at the reference site (Fajardo). All species analyzed in PM2.5, except Fe, were significantly higher at Guaynabo when compared to Fajardo. Ni and V exhibited the highest metal concentrations (Ni = 17 ng m-3 and V = 40 ng m-3) in Guaynabo. Fe showed stronger relationships between PM at each site suggesting their release from similar sources at that particular location, probably due to Sahara dust. © by PSP 2007.",Air pollution; Arsenic; Heavy metal; Respiratory uptake; Sahara dust,atmospheric pollution; chemical analysis; concentration (composition); dust; filter; metal; particulate matter; urban area; Africa; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Islands; Fajardo; Greater Antilles; Guaynabo; Puerto Rico; Sahara; Salinas [Puerto Rico]; Vieques,
Purification and three-dimensional electron microscopy structure of the neisseria meningitidis type IV Pilus biogenesis protein PilG,"Collins R.F., Saleem M., Derrick J.P.",2007,Journal of Bacteriology,"Type IV pili are surface-exposed retractable fibers which play a key role in the pathogenesis of Neisseria meningitidis and other gram-negative pathogens. PilG is an integral inner membrane protein and a component of the type IV pilus biogenesis system. It is related by sequence to the extensive GspF family of secretory proteins, which are involved in type II secretion processes. PilG was overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli membranes by detergent extraction and metal ion affinity chromatography. Analysis of the purified protein by perfluoro-octanoic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that PilG formed dimers and tetramers. A three-dimensional (3-D) electron microscopy structure of the PilG multimer was determined using single-particle averaging applied to samples visualized by negative staining. Symmetry analysis of the unsymmetrized 3-D volume provided further evidence that the PilG multimer is a tetramer. The reconstruction also revealed an asymmetric bilobed structure approximately 125 Å in length and 80 Å in width. The larger lobe within the structure was identified as the N terminus by location of Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid nanogold particles to the N-terminal polyhistidine tag. We propose that the smaller lobe corresponds to the periplasmic domain of the protein, with the narrower ""waist"" region being the transmembrane section. This constitutes the first report of a 3-D structure of a member of the GspF family and suggests a physical basis for the role of the protein in linking cytoplasmic and periplasmic protein components of the type II secretion and type IV pilus biogenesis systems.

Contrast-enhanced versus systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate cancer detection: An overview of techniques and a systematic review,"Heijmink S.W.T.P.J., Barentsz J.O.",2007,European Journal of Radiology,"An overview is given of the current conventional and contrast-specific transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) techniques for prostate imaging that may be used for guiding biopsy. Subsequently, a systematic literature search resulted in inclusion of four studies that directly compared systematic and contrast-enhanced-targeted TRUS-guided biopsy of the prostate. All four studies revealed that contrast-enhanced-targeted TRUS-guided biopsy significantly improved the positive biopsy core rate. In the largest study, the mean Gleason score of the contrast-enhanced-targeted TRUS-guided biopsies was significantly higher than that of the systematic biopsies. Future randomized clinical trials, preferably in a non-academic multi-institutional set-up, will have to be performed to confirm the value of contrast-enhanced-targeted TRUS-guided biopsy in regular clinical practice. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Malignant distal biliary obstruction: A systematic review and meta-analysis of endoscopic and surgical bypass results,"Moss A.C., Morris E., Leyden J., MacMathuna P.",2007,Cancer Treatment Reviews,"Background: Surgical bypass and endoscopic stents are available for palliative bypass of malignant distal biliary obstruction. Aim: Comparison of reported outcomes in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which included surgery, endoscopic plastic stents or endoscopic metal stents in palliative relief of malignant distal biliary obstruction. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature and conference proceedings review to June 2006. Results: We found 24 studies, containing 2436 patients, which met our inclusion criteria. Endoscopic stenting with plastic stents (three studies) is associated with a lower risk of complications (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45-0.81), but a higher risk of recurrent biliary obstruction (RR 18.59, 95% CI 5.33 -64.86) than traditional surgical bypass. Self-expanding metal stents (seven studies) are associated with a significantly reduced risk of recurrent biliary obstruction at 4 months (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.3, 0.63), or prior to death or end of study (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39-0.69), but are not superior to plastic stents in terms of technical success, therapeutic success, mortality or complications. Cost-effectiveness outcomes were not suitable for meta-analysis. No other plastic stent designs have been demonstrated to be superior to polyethylene stents (12 studies). Conclusions: Endoscopic metal stents are the intervention of choice in patients with malignant distal biliary obstruction, producing similar outcomes to plastic stents, but with improved patency rates. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

"Behaviour of palladium(II), platinum(IV), and rhodium(III) in artificial and natural waters: Influence of reactor surface and geochemistry on metal recovery","Cobelo-Garcia A., Turner A., Millward G.E., Couceiro F.",2007,Analytica Chimica Acta,"The recovery of dissolved platinum group elements (PGE: Pd(II), Pt(IV) and Rh(III)) added to Milli-Q® water, artificial freshwater and seawater and filtered natural waters has been studied, as a function of pH and PGE concentration, in containers of varying synthetic composition. The least adsorptive and/or precipitative loss was obtained for borosilicate glass under most of the conditions employed, whereas the greatest loss was obtained for low-density polyethylene. Of the polymeric materials tested, the adsorptive and/or precipitative loss of PGE was lowest for fluorinated ethylene propylene (Teflon®). The loss of Pd(II) in freshwater was significant due to its affinity for surface adsorption and its relatively low solubility. The presence of natural dissolved organic matter increases the recovery of Pd(II) but enhances the loss of Pt(IV). The loss of Rh(III) in seawater was significant and was mainly due to precipitation, whereas Pd(II) recovery was enhanced, compared to freshwater, because of its complexation with chloride. The results have important implications regarding protocols employed for sample preservation and controlled laboratory experiments used in the study of the speciation and biogeochemical behaviour of PGE. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Molecular imaging with targeted contrast ultrasound,"Kaufmann B.A., Lindner J.R.",2007,Current Opinion in Biotechnology,"Molecular imaging with contrast ultrasound relies on the detection of targeted microbubbles or other acoustically active nanoparticles. These microbubbles are retained in diseased tissue where they produce an acoustic signal because of their resonant properties in the ultrasound field. Targeting is accomplished either through manipulating the chemical properties of the microbubble shell or through conjugation of disease-specific ligands for the targeted molecule to the microbubble surface. As microbubbles cannot leave the intravascular space, the disease process must be characterized by molecular changes in the vascular compartment to be imaged. Inflammation, angiogenesis and thrombus formation are central pathophysiologic processes in many disease states and produce phenotypic changes in the vascular compartment. Thus, targeted contrast ultrasound in the future could aid in the diagnosis of such diverse diseases as atherosclerosis, transplant rejection and tumor-related angiogenesis. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Fabrication and impedance studies of DMFC anode incorporated with CNT-supported high-metal-content electrocatalyst,"Jeng K.-T., Chien C.-C., Hsu N.-Y., Huang W.-M., Chiou S.-D., Lin S.-H.",2007,Journal of Power Sources,"In this study, the fabrication of a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) anode with the incorporation of a multiwalled carbon nanotube (CNT)-supported high-metal-content Pt/Ru electrocatalyst, i.e., 40 wt%Pt-20 wt%Ru/CNT, using a novel approach and the resultant DMFC performances were investigated. Employing a vacuum filtration method, we were able to successfully fabricate the DMFC anode with a good electrode structure using an in-house prepared Pt-Ru/CNT electrocatalyst. The catalyst layer was formed directly on a Teflon-treated carbon cloth having a buckypaper texture with a catalyst loading of 4.0 mg cm-2. From single-cell tests, excellent cell performances were obtained. At 80 °C, the power density was found to be as high as &gt;100 mW cm-2. This can be attributed to a thinner catalyst layer formed with a more efficient utilization of the catalyst than that using a low-metal-content counterpart, i.e., 20 wt%Pt-10 wt%Ru/CNT, as reported in an earlier study. However, the Nafion® ionomer content in the catalyst layer played a key role in the anode fabrication to obtain a good cell performance. In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with a constant phase element (CPE)-based equivalent-circuit model was employed to analyze the fabricated anode. It distinctively revealed some specific characteristics in the resistances and the interface properties. Overall, the obtained impedance results are somewhat different from those of a conventional DMFC anode with the catalyst layer coated onto a porous gas diffusion layer (GDL) on a carbon backing material. Based on the experimental results and the impedance analyses, the high-metal-content Pt-Ru/CNT catalyst was found to be much more favorable and suitable for use as a DMFC anode catalyst. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

"Chapter Five Materials for State-of-the-Art PEM Fuel Cells, and Their Suitability for Operation Above 100°C","de Bruijn F.A., Makkus R.C., Mallant R.K.A.M., Janssen G.J.M.",2007,Advances in Fuel Cells,"This review gives an overview of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells on the materials level. Materials for proton conducting membranes, electrodes and bipolar plates are described from the perspective of their suitability for longterm operation in automotive and stationary applications. The state-of-the-art PEM fuel cells consisting of perfluorosulfonic acid membranes, platinum-based electrodes and graphite(-composite)-based bipolar plates are in a well advanced state of development. Although the main constituents are in use for many years, impressive improvements in performance and lifetime have been realized, leading to cost reduction, size reduction, improved robustness and mass manufacturing. For the sake of system simplification, increasing the temperature of operation of the proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) would be beneficial. New materials are needed to enable operation at higher tem- peratures, and not less important, lower relative humidities. The suitability of present state-of-the-art materials for operation above 100°C is discussed, as well as a critical review of the suitability of emerging concepts. No alternative material that combines the virtues of the present materials with the ability of operation above 100°C has been developed so far. Therefore, the first commercial introduction of PEM fuel cells is likely to be based on the components that are at present in use, making use of perfluorosulfonic acid membranes. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Periurethral injection therapy for urinary incontinence in women,"Keegan P.E., Atiemo K., Cody J., McClinton S., Pickard R.",2007,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,"Background: Periurethral or transurethral injection of bulking agents is a surgical procedure most often used for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence a common, troublesome symptom amongst adult women. Objectives: To assess the effects of periurethral/transurethral injection therapy in the treatment of urinary incontinence in women. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (28 February 2007), MEDLINE (January 1996 to March 2007, PREMEDLINE (7 February 2007) and the reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of treatment for urinary incontinence, in which at least one management arm involved periurethral/transurethral injection therapy. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality of each study using explicit criteria. Data extraction was undertaken independently using a standard form and clarification concerning possible unreported data sought directly from the investigators. Main results: We identified twelve trials including 1318 women that met the inclusion criteria. The limited data available were not suitable for meta-analysis. Injection of autologous fat was compared to placebo in a study of 68 women which was terminated early because of safety concerns. No differences in subjective or objective outcome were found in the two groups. No studies were found comparing injection therapy with conservative treatment. Two studies that compared injection with surgical management found significantly better objective outcome in the surgical group. Eight studies compared different agents - all results had wide confidence intervals. Silicone particles, calcium hydroxylapatite, ethylene vinyl alcohol and carbon spheres gave improvements equivalent to collagen. Porcine dermal implant gave improvements comparable to silicone at six months. A comparison of periurethral and transurethral methods of delivery of the bulking agent found similar outcome but a higher rate of early complications in the periurethral group. Authors' conclusions: Despite five additional trials, this updated review is still an unsatisfactory basis for practice. The trials were small and generally of moderate quality. The only evidence of benefit comes for within-group short-term changes following injection. The finding that placebo saline injection was followed by a similar symptomatic improvement questions the mechanism of any effects. There were no trials in comparison with pelvic floor muscle training -the obvious non-surgical comparator. Greater symptomatic improvement was observed after surgery, although these advantages need to be set against likely higher risks. No clear-cut conclusions could be drawn from trials comparing alternative agents; one small trial suggests that periurethral injection may carry more risks than transurethral injection. The single trial of autologous fat provides a reminder that periurethral injections can occasionally cause serious side-effects. Pending further evidence, injection therapymay represent a useful option for short-term symptomatic relief amongst selected women with co-morbidity that precludes anaesthesia - two or three injections are likely to be required to achieve a satisfactory result.

Determining aluminum dissolution when cooking food in aluminium cans [Determinação da dissolução de alumínio durante cozimento de alimentos em panelas de alumínio],"Dantas S.T., Saron E.S., Dantas F.B.H., Yamashita D.M., Kiyataka P.H.M.",2007,Ciencia e Tecnologia de Alimentos,"Aluminum is associated with neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer by some authors. Although this has never been confirmed, there is evidence of an accumulation in kidneys of people with renal problems. This present work was carried out to address this subject by evaluating the occurrence of significant aluminum migration from cooking utensils during food preparation. Eight types of food cooked in different ways and three distinct types of pans (a saucepan, pressure cooker and frying pan), with and without teflon coating, were evaluated. The metal analysis was conducted in an Optical Emission Spectrometer with Inductively Coupled Plasma. The results showed insignificant transference of aluminum in some food products. The main transference occurred when tomato sauce was prepared, which has a low pH, in the pan without teflon coating. The menu prepared with all the foods for two meals in a day showed that the aluminum mass incorporated by the food corresponded to 2% of the daily consumption limit of aluminum for a 60 kg person (1 mg.kg-1 of body weight per day). Thus, the use of aluminum pans in food cooking practically does not interfere in the total consumption of aluminum allowed for people.",Aluminum cooking utensils; Aluminum migration; Cooking; Foods,Lycopersicon esculentum,"Sociedade Brasileira de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Alimentos, SBCTA"

Striking similarities between OTA-induced porcine nephropathy in pigs and BEN in humans are observed. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified OTA as a possible human carcinogen (group 2B). Currently, the mode of carcinogenic action by OTA is unknown. OTA is genotoxic following oxidative metabolism. This activity is thought to play a central role in OTA-mediated carcinogenesis and may be divided into direct (covalent DNA adduction) and indirect (oxidative DNA damage) mechanisms of action. Evidence for a direct mode of genotoxicity has been derived from the sensitive 32P-postlabelling assay. OTA facilitates guanine-specific DNA adducts in vitro and in rat and pig kidney orally dosed, one adduct comigrates with a synthetic carbon (C)-bonded C8-dG OTA adduct standard. In this paper, our current understanding of OTA toxicity and carcinogenicity are reviewed. The available evidence suggests that OTA is a genotoxic carcinogen by induction of oxidative DNA lesions coupled with direct DNA adducts via quinone formation. This mechanism of action should be used to establish acceptable intake levels of OTA from human food sources. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Influence of surface roughness and hydrophobicity on bacterial adhesion and colonization,"Tang H., Liang X., Cao T., Salley S.O., McAllister II J.P., Ng K.Y.S.",2006,"AIChE Annual Meeting, Conference Proceedings","Introduction: Bacterial adhesion and colonization are complicated processes that involve many factors, including surface chemistry, hydrophobicity, and surface roughness, but the roles of these factors are not clear. The objective of this study was to modify hydrophobicity and roughness on one polymeric surface, and measure the corresponding bacterial adhesion and colonization changes. Methods: One- and two-dimensional mechanically-assembled (stretched) monolayer (MAM) methods were used to enhance hydrophobicity of fluoroalkylsilane (FAS) coatings on silicone. Surface roughness was varied with different abrasives. Surface hydrophobicity and roughness were determined by contact angle measurement and atomic force microscopy, respectively. Bacterial adhesion and colonization were quantified using scanning electron microscopy and direct colony-counting. Results: Hydrophobicity increased as a function of stretched length or width (Δx); it reached a maximum at Δx = 60% with one- and two-dimensional MAM and decreased as Δx increased to 80% and 100%. After 12 hr incubation, all of FAS/silicone surfaces significantly reduced the adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis from 42% to 88% compared to untreated silicone. Moreover, bacterial adhesion as function of Δx had an opposite trend, i.e. when hydrophobicity increased bacterial adhesion decreased and vice versa. Surface roughness had a significant effect on bacterial adhesion and colonization when the root-mean-square roughness was higher than 200nm. Conclusion: On FAS/silicone surfaces, bacterial adhesion was reduced significantly, and was inversely related to surface hydrophobicity. Moreover, a rougher surface promoted bacterial adhesion and colonization; however, there is a certain threshold (below 200nm) below which there was no significant decrease in bacterial adhesion and colonization.",,Atomic forces; Bacterial adhesions; Fluoroalkylsilane; Opposite trends; Polymeric surfaces; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Surface hydrophobicities; Adhesion; Angle measurement; Bacteriology; Contact angle; Friction; Hydrophobicity; Metal analysis; Monolayers; Photoresists; Polymers; Probability density function; Silicone coatings; Silicones; Surface chemistry; Surface properties; Surface roughness; Two dimensional,
Investigation of doppler ultrasound velocity-based indices for carotid plaque ulcerations using In Vitro flow models,"Wong E.Y., Thorne M.L., Nikolov H.N., Poepping T.L., Rankin R.N., Holdsworth D.W.",2006,Proceedings - IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium,"Previous studies have shown that the presence of surface irregularities, known as ulcerations, in carotid plaque is an independent risk factor for stroke. Doppler ultrasound (DUS) has not been implemented as a diagnostic tool for carotid plaque ulcerations. We employed carotid bifurcation flow models that differed only with respect to the presence of ulceration to study the sole effect of surface roughness on Doppler-derived flow parameters. A pair of in vitro flow models were fabricated, each based on an idealized carotid bifurcation geometry of 50% eccentric stenosis. For one of these models, a 2-mm diameter hemi-spherical ulcer was incorporated at the level of the apex on the non-flow divider wall. DUS measurements were acquired using a 4-MHz probe and 1.0-mm sample volume, delivering 4-D Doppler velocity data sets with 11.7-ms temporal resolution and 1.3-cm s-1 velocity resolution. Velocity data was analyzed for several indices. Teflon flow phantom facilitated both the direct machining of realistic vessel geometries with varying surface roughness (± 0.05-mm) and compatibility with Doppler ultrasound. The small 2-mm hemi-spherical ulcer did not introduce any significant differences in downstream velocity patterns, as indicated by turbulence intensity, peak velocity, or mean velocity. We have developed a DUS technique to characterize carotid plaque ulceration, and have shown that DUS velocity-based measurements of turbulence intensity are feasible with conventional systems. This approach will allow us to extend our paired comparison studies to other ulcer shapes and sizes. © 2006 IEEE.",Blood-flow velocity; Carotid plaque ulceration; Doppler ultrasound; In vitro; Plaque surface roughness; Stroke risk; Turbulence intensity,Carotid plaques; Doppler ultrasound; In-vitro; Plaque surface roughness; Stroke risk; Turbulence intensity; Bifurcation (mathematics); Blood; Dermatology; Diseases; Flow velocity; Metal analysis; Non Newtonian flow; Surface properties; Turbulence; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonics; Velocity; Surface roughness,
The influence of occupational exposure on male reproductive function,"Jensen T.K., Bonde J.P., Joffe M.",2006,Occupational Medicine,"Recently, many studies have found a decrease in semen quality which has increased the focus on male reproductive health. Occupational hazards are by far the best documented in reproductive epidemiological research. Generally, occupational exposures have been divided into physical exposures (heat and radiation), chemical exposures (solvents and pesticides), psychological exposures (distress), exposure to metals and welding. The recent and/or most important epidemiological studies exploring the effect of occupational exposures on semen quality and fecundity, the ability to conceive, are reviewed. The evidence for an adverse effect on male reproduction of several occupational and environmental exposures and toxicants, such as heat, ionizing radiation, inorganic lead, dibromochloropropane, ethylene dibromide, some ethylene glycol ethers, carbon disulfide and welding operations, is strongly supported in well-designed epidemiological studies. For other agents, the association is only suspected or suggested and needs further evaluation before conclusions can be drawn. It is also important to bear in mind that many workers in the non-Western world still are exposed to substances that are banned in the Western world, sometimes in high concentrations. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",Males; Occupational exposure; Reproductive health; Semen quality,"1,2 dibromoethane; 2 ethoxyethanol; 2 methoxyethanol; acetic acid; acetone; alachlor; androgen; atrazine; carbaril; carbon disulfide; chemical agent; chlordecone; dibromochloropropane; dimpylate; ethylene glycol; herbicide; lead; metal; organic solvent; organohalogen derivative; pesticide; solvent; tetrachloroethylene; trichloroethylene; vinclozolin; age; androgen release; azoospermia; body posture; burnout; childhood cancer; congenital disorder; dietary intake; drug use; environmental exposure; evidence based medicine; health behavior; human; ionizing radiation; job stress; Leydig cell; life event; lifestyle; long term exposure; male; male fertility; male genital system; male infertility; medical research; occupation; occupational exposure; occupational hazard; oligospermia; priority journal; psychological aspect; radiation exposure; reproduction; reproductive health; review; semen analysis; Sertoli cell; sexual behavior; smoking habit; sperm; spermatogenesis; spermatozoon count; spontaneous abortion; thermal exposure; welding; Fertilization; Humans; Lead; Male; Metallurgy; Occupational Exposure; Paternal Exposure; Pesticides; Posture; Semen; Solvents; Stress, Psychological; Time Factors",
A critical analysis of the cyclic and open alternatives of the transmetalation step in the stille cross-coupling reaction,"Nova A., Ujaque G., Maseras F., Lledós A., Espinet P.",2006,Journal of the American Chemical Society,"The transmetalation step of the Stille cross-coupling reaction catalyzed by PdL2 (L = PH3, AsH3) has been analyzed by means of DFT methods for PhBr as the electrophile and CH2=CHSnMe 3 as the nucleophile. Both experimentally proposed mechanisms (cyclic and open) were theoretically studied. For the case of the cyclic mechanism, the associative and dissociative ligand substitution alternatives were both analyzed. For the case of the open mechanism, the cis and the trans pathways were evaluated. All the reaction pathways were also studied taking into account the solvent effects by means of continuum models, for THF and PhCl as solvents. In selected cases, explicit solvent molecules were introduced to account for their potential role as ligands. Theoretical analysis indicates that the open reaction mechanism is preferred for organotriflate systems, whereas the cyclic mechanism is favored for the reaction with organohalide systems. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,Dissociation; Mathematical models; Metal analysis; Probability density function; Substitution reactions; Ligands; Organotriflate systems; Stille cross coupling reaction; Transmetalation; Reaction kinetics; arsine derivative; bromine derivative; chlorobenzene; ligand; organohalogen derivative; palladium; phosphine; solvent; tetrahydrofuran; tin derivative; trifluoromethanesulfonic acid; triphenylarsine; unclassified drug; article; catalysis; chemical reaction; cis trans isomerism; cyclization; density functional theory; dissociation; ligand binding; model; reaction analysis; solvent effect; Stille reaction; transmetalation,

Cellular effects and metabolic stability of N1-cyclic inosine diphosphoribose and its derivatives,"Kirchberger T., Wagner G., Xu J., Cordiglieri C., Wang P., Gasser A., Fliegert R., Bruhn S., Flügel A., Lund F.E., Zhang L.-H., Potter B.V.L., Guse A.H.",2006,British Journal of Pharmacology,"Background and purpose: Recently, a number of mimics of the second messenger cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) with replacement of adenosine by inosine were introduced. In addition, various alterations in the molecule ranging from substitutions at C8 of the base up to full replacement of the ribose moieties still retained biological activity. However, nothing is known about the metabolic stability and cellular effects of these novel analogues. Experimental approach: cADPR and the inosine-based analogues were incubated with CD38, ADP-ribosyl cyclase and NAD-glycohydrolase and metabolism was analysed by RP-HPLC. Furthermore, the effect of the analogues on cytokine expression and proliferation was investigated in primary T-lymphocytes and T-lymphoma cells. Key results: Incubation of cADPR with CD38 resulted in degradation to adenosine diphosphoribose. ADP-ribosyl cyclase weakly catabolised cADPR whereas NAD-glycohydrolase showed no such activity. In contrast, N1-cyclic inosine 5′-diphosphoribose (N1-cIDPR) was not hydrolyzed by CD38. Three additional N1-cIDPR analogues showed a similar stability. Proliferation of Jurkat T-lymphoma cells was inhibited by N1-cIDPR, N1-[(phosphoryl-O-ethoxy)-methyl]- N9-[(phosphoryl-O-ethoxy)-methyl]-hypoxanthine-cyclic pyrophosphate (N1-cIDP-DE) and N1-ethoxymethyl-cIDPR (N1-cIDPRE). In contrast, in primary T cells neither proliferation nor cytokine expression was affected by these compounds. Conclusions and Implications:The metabolic stability of N1-cIDPR and its analogues provides an advantage for the development of novel pharmaceutical compounds interfering with cADPR mediated Ca 2+ signalling pathways. The differential effects of N1-cIDPR and N1-cIDPRE on proliferation and cytokine expression in primary T cells versus T-lymphoma cells may constitute a starting point for novel anti-tumor drugs. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.

Oxygen therapeutics: Oxygen delivery without blood,"Stollings J.L., Oyen L.J.",2006,Pharmacotherapy,"Nearly 14 million units of packed red blood cells are transfused in the United States each year. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in 1999, 6% of hospitals reported a shortage of blood, resulting in the cancellation or postponement of surgical procedures. The many limitations and risks of transfusions of packed red blood cells in critically ill patients have facilitated interest in developing alternative agents for oxygen delivery. Over the past few decades, safe and effective substitutes have been in development. However, no currently approved agent provides both oxygen transport and volume in place of packed red blood cells. Oxygen therapeutic products have several advantages compared with packed red blood cells, including a prolonged shelf-life, lack of a cross-matching requirement, and minimal infectious risks or concerns about immunogenicity Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers and perfluorocarbons are being developed. Two products are undergoing clinical trials. Polyheme is undergoing a phase III study in trauma patients, and Hemopure is being evaluated in a phase II study in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. A third product (Hemolink) was being evaluated in a phase III study in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery; however, the trial was suspended. In addition, several other hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers are in the preclinical stages. Oxygen therapeutics have several potential clinical applications in the management of perioperative blood loss, trauma, acute normovolemic hemodilution, traumatic brain injury, and blood requirements in patients who refuse or have contraindications to transfusions of red blood cells.",Blood; Blood substitutes; HBOCs; Hemoglobin; Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers; Oxygen therapeutics; Perfluorocarbons; PFCs; Red blood cells; Transfusions,"2,3 diphosphoglyceric acid; acid citrate dextrose; blood substitute; diaspirin crosslinked hemoglobin; fluorocarbon; fluosol da; hboc 301; hemoglobin; hemospan; methemoglobin reductase; nitric oxide; nitric oxide synthase; oxyglobin; perfluorooctyl bromide; politef; polymerized hemoglobin; abdominal discomfort; adult respiratory distress syndrome; anemia; autooxidation; backache; bacteremia; bleeding; blood compatibility; blood transfusion; cardiopulmonary bypass; cost; Creutzfeldt Jakob disease; critically ill patient; erythrocyte concentrate; esophagus motility; fever; flu like syndrome; flushing; food and drug administration; heart infarction; hemodilution; hemorrhagic shock; Hepatitis A virus; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis C virus; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; hypertension; hypotension; hypovolemia; immunogenicity; infection risk; jaundice; Jehovah's witness; malaise; mortality; multiple organ failure; oxygen affinity; oxygen dissociation curve; patient safety; perioperative period; reticuloendothelial system; review; septic shock; shelf life; sickle cell anemia; stroke; systematic review; thrombocytopenia; transfusion related acute lung injury; traumatic brain injury; United States; virus transmission; West Nile flavivirus; Blood Substitutes; Blood Transfusion; Erythrocytes; Fluorocarbons; Hemoglobins; Humans; Oxygen; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Oxyhemoglobins; Risk Assessment",
LC-MS in metabonomics: Optimization of experimental conditions for the analysis of metabolites in human urine,"Waybright T.J., Van Q.N., Muschik G.M., Conrads T.P., Veenstra T.D., Issaq H.J.",2006,Journal of Liquid Chromatography and Related Technologies,"The analysis of metabolic pathways for dysfunction has been used for many years in the scientific and medical community to determine overall health. Metabonomics (metabolomics), the global profiling of metabolites, has experienced a rekindling of interest due, in part, to advances in analytical instrumentation for conducting measurements and informatics available for interpretation of the data acquired in this area of biomedical research. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) based approaches are two primary analytical methods of choice for conducting metabonomic measurements. To overcome the complexity and wide dynamic range of concentrations of metabolites present in biological samples, a common practice is to couple online an analytical separation, typically high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), with the mass spectrometer. Hence, of critical importance are not only the MS acquisition parameters, but also optimization of those variables that impact the analytical HPLC separation as well. A systematic investigation of a number of variables related to HPLC, such as mobile phase composition and flow rate, gradient time, column dimensions, and packing material properties has been conducted. The results of this study show that 10 cm long × 1 mm inner diameter (i.d.), C18 reversed-phase columns provide higher resolution than C8 or C4 columns for the analysis of urine samples. The results also show that longer columns and extended mobile phase gradients allowed detection of a greater number of metabolites. As expected, MS analysis of the same urine sample using positive and negative ionization modes resulted in detection of a different ensemble of metabolites. Though prior dilution of rat and mouse urine is a common practice in conducting HPLC-MS metabonomic analyses, our results suggest that a greater number of species may be observed using undiluted urine. The matrix (composition) of urine collected from different individuals affected the reproducibility of retention times. The variability in metabolite retention times using internal standards, although improved, was not completely corrected.

Determination of degradation compounds derived from Lewisite by high performance liquid chromatography/inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry,"Kinoshita K., Shikino O., Seto Y., Kaise T.",2006,Applied Organometallic Chemistry,"A method for determination of 2-chlorovinylarsenous acid (CVAA) and 2-chlorovinylarsonic acid (CVAOA), which are degradation compounds of the chemical warfare agent Lewisite, was examined by high-performance liquid chromatography/inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (HPLC/ICP-MS). Inertsil C8 was suitable as the column and the mobile phase was consisted of 0.1% formic acid-acetonitrile (80:20). These compounds were detected sensitively in a short time and separated from inorganic arsenicals and diphenylarsinic acid (DPAA) and phenylarsonic acid (PAA), which are degradation compounds of diphenylchloroarsine and phenyldichloroarsine, respectively. The detection limits of CVAA and CVAOA were 0.2 and 0.1 ngAs/ml, respectively. In addition, a dynamic reaction cell and oxygen as the reaction gas were applied, and then arsenic was detected as AsO+ (m/z 91) in order to prevent interference by ArCl+ (m/z 75). This method was applied to the analysis of urine obtained from a CVAA-administered mouse and CVAOA was detected as the main metabolite. Thus, the speciation analysis of arsenic compounds derived from chemical warfare agents was achieved by HPLC/ICP-MS.

Weak noncovalent Si⋯F-C interactions stabilized fluoroalkylated rod-like polysilanes as ultrasensitive chemosensors,"Saxena A., Rai R., Kim S.-Y., Fujiki M., Naito M., Okoshi K., Kwak G.",2006,"Journal of Polymer Science, Part A: Polymer Chemistry","Noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, and π-π stacking, are increasingly being utilized to develop well-ordered and self-organized supramolecular materials. Recently, new types of nonclassical weak interactions, such as C-H∞π, C-H∞F-C, and C-H∞O, have been exploited in stabilizing the specific conformations of molecules and molecular assemblies in the solid state. These noncovalent interactions play an important role in materials comprised of polymer chains, because cooperative effects from a large number of weak interactions can lead to drastic changes in its conformation, several properties, and functionalities. The programmed design of synthetic helical polymer with well-defined molecular conformation has been the main subject in modern polymer science and engineering. Silicon-catenated polysilane is an ideal helical silicon quantum wire and polymers with unique photophysical properties. The present review highlights the spectroscopic evidences for through-space weak Si∞F-C interaction in poly(methyl-3,3,3-trifluoropropylsilane) (1) in noncoordinating and coordinating solvents by means of NMR (29Si and 19F) and IR spectroscopies, and viscometric measurement.

"Evaluation of D-isomers of O-18F-fluoromethyl, O- 18F-fluoroethyl and O-18F-fluoropropyl tyrosine as tumour imaging agents in mice","Tsukada H., Sato K., Fukumoto D., Kakiuchi T.",2006,European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the properties of the D-amino acid isomers O-18F-fluoromethyl tyrosine (18F-FMT), O- 18F-fluoroethyl tyrosine (18F-FET) and O- 18F-fluoropropyl tyrosine (18F-FPT) as tumour-detecting agents with PET in comparison with the corresponding L-isomers. L- or D- 18F-FMT, 18F-FET or 18F-FPT, prepared by 18F-fluoromethylation, 18F-fluoroethylation or 18F-fluoropropylation of L- and D-tyrosine, was intravenously injected into BALB/cA Jcl-nu mice bearing HeLa tumour cells. At 5, 15, 30 and 60 min post intravenous administration, the uptake of each compound in normal abdominal organs and xenotransplanted HeLa cells was determined using the tissue dissection method. Metabolic stability analyses of these compounds in the plasma were performed with the thin-layer chromatography method. In the plasma fraction, although L- and D-isomers of 18F-FMT, 18F-FET and 18F-FPT provided comparable metabolic stability, D-isomers of these labelled compounds revealed a faster elimination rate than their L-isomers, with a higher peak uptake in the blood and kidney 5 min post administration. Compared with natural amino acid ligands, such as L- 11C-methionine, the uptake of L-isomers of these labelled compounds was relatively low and stable in the abdominal organs, while D-isomers revealed much lower and faster clearance rates compared with the corresponding L-isomers. Among the abdominal organs, the pancreas showed relatively high uptake of all the labelled compounds used here, and the uptake of D-isomers was much lower than that of the L-isomers. Although tumour uptake levels of D-isomers of 18F-FMT, 18F-FET and 18F-FPT were almost 95%, 43% and 39% of the uptake levels of each of the L-isomers 60 min post administration, the tumour-to-blood ratios of these D-isomers were 181%, 137% and 101% of the ratios of the corresponding L-isomers. D-isomers of 18F-FMT and 18F-FET indicated improved tumour-to-liver ratios compared with the corresponding L-isomers, and D-18F-FPT showed the highest tumour-to-pancreas ratio among all the other compounds assayed here. These results suggest that D-isomers of 18F-fluoroalkyl tyrosine analogues are potential tracers for tumour imaging with PET. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",D-Amino acids; HeLa cell; O-18F- fluoroethyl tyrosine; O-18F-fluoromethyl tyrosine; O-18F-fluoropropyl tyrosine,"dextro amino acid; fluorine 18; ligand; methionine c 11; o fluoroethyltyrosine f 18; o fluoromethyltyrosine f 18; o fluoropropyltyrosine f 18; tyrosine; tyrosine derivative; unclassified drug; abdomen; amino acid analysis; amino acid blood level; amino acid metabolism; amino acid transport; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; drug distribution; drug elimination; drug stability; drug tissue level; drug uptake; HeLa cell; human; human cell; internalization; isomer; isomerism; isotope labeling; kidney; liver; molecular imaging; mouse; mouse strain; nonhuman; pancreas; positron emission tomography; thin layer chromatography; tumor diagnosis; xenotransplantation; Animals; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Female; Fluorine Radioisotopes; Hela Cells; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Neoplasms, Experimental; Positron-Emission Tomography; Radiopharmaceuticals; Stereoisomerism; Tissue Distribution; Tyrosine",
Vesicoureteric Reflux in Children,"Ismaili K., Avni F.E., Piepsz A., Collier F., Schulman C., Hall M.",2006,EAU-EBU Update Series,"Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is a common finding in pediatric practice that occurs in about 1% of children and is often familial, with several genetical loci probably involved. The majority of low-grade cases have a tendency to resolve spontaneously during childhood. However, VUR has been identified as a risk factor for the development of urinary tract infections (UTI) and is present in a third of young children presenting with this problem. In addition, some children with high-grade VUR have already renal lesions before the advent of any UTI. In a subset of affected individuals, these renal parenchymal lesions are associated with systemic hypertension and chronic renal failure but this risk is considerably smaller than previously assumed. In randomized trials of primary VUR diagnosed after urinary infection, prophylactic antibiotics are equivalent to anti-reflux surgery when subsequent renal lesions and UTIs relapses are used as endpoints.

"Synthesis, analgesic and antipyretic activity of 2-(antipyrin-4-yl) hydrazones of 1,2,3-triketones and their derivatives","Shchegol'kov E.V., Khudina O.G., Anikina L.V., Burgart Ya.V., Saloutin V.I.",2006,Pharmaceutical Chemistry Journal,"1,2,3-Triketone 2-(antipyrin-4-yl)hydrazones were synthesized via the azo-coupling reactions of 1,3-diketones with 2-(antipyrin-4-yl)diazonium chloride. The fluoroalkyl-containing hetarylhydrazone enters into cyclocondensation with hydrazines at the 1,3-dicarbonyl fragment to yield 3-tetrafluoroethyl derivatives of pyrazole. It was found that 1,2,3-triketone 2-(antipyrin-4-yl)hydrazones and N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-substituted pyrazole exhibit analgesic activity comparable with that of their structural analog analgin (metamizole sodium), but do not possess antipyretic properties. In contrast, N-phenyl-substituted pyrazole did not exhibit analgesic properties but produced a certain antipyretic effect four hours after pyrogenic administration.

Nafion-Coated Bismuth Film and Nafion-Coated Mercury Film Electrodes for Anodic Stripping Voltammetry Combined On-Line with ICP-Mass Spectrometry,"Cao G.X., Jimenez O., Zhou F., Xu M.",2006,Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry,"Nafion-coated bismuth film electrodes (NCBFEs) and Nafion-coated mercury film electrodes (NCMFEs) were used to electrochemically preconcentrate metal analytes for subsequent analysis by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Either type of electrodes is part of a thin-layer electrochemical flow cell that is positioned upstream of a microconcentric nebulizer for the ICP-MS. Performances of these electrodes were compared in terms of the analytical ""figures of merit"" (e.g., dynamic ranges, reproducibility, hydrodynamic stability, and elimination of matrix effects detrimental to ICP-MS). The coupled technique (ASV-ICP-MS) is found to possess a wide dynamic range (at least 4 to 5 orders of magnitude) and to be reproducible. Both electrodes are much more stable than the thin mercury film electrode (TMFE) traditionally used for ASV-ICP-MS, with the lifetime of the NCBFE exceeding 8 h. Adopting these electrodes for ASV-ICP-MS overcomes the problems associated with a TMFE, the erosion of which decreases the sample throughput, affects the analysis precision, and contaminates conventional glass nebulizers and spray chambers of the spectrometer. The medium exchange procedure inherent in ASV is successfully implemented with a two-valve flow injection system for the accumulation of trace Cd2+ into the electrode from a certified seawater sample, followed by stripping Cd into a solution that is compatible to the ICP-MS operation. © 2006 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.",,"Anodic Stripping Voltammetry; Glass nebulizers; Nafion-coated bismuth film electrodes (NCBFE); Nafion-coated mercury film electrodes (NCMFE); Thin mercury film electrode (TMFE); Bismuth; Cadmium; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrochemistry; Inductively coupled plasma; Mass spectrometry; Mercury (metal); Thin films; Electrochemical electrodes; bismuth; cadmium; mercury; sea water; accuracy; anodic stripping potentiometry; article; atomic emission spectrometry; electrochemistry; electrode; erosion; film coating; flow injection analysis; hydrodynamics; material coating; nebulizer; reproducibility; spectrometer; Adsorption; Algorithms; Bismuth; Electrodes; Electroplating; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Fluorocarbon Polymers; Membranes, Artificial; Mercury; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization",
High frequency oscillation and liquid ventilation,Greenough A.,2006,Paediatric Respiratory Reviews,"During high frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV) small tidal volumes are delivered at fast frequencies, usually between 10 and 15 Hz. Meta-analysis of randomised trials of prophylactic HFOV versus conventional ventilation have demonstrated only a modest reduction in BPD amongst survivors in the HFOV groups. Similarly, no long term advantages of HFOV have been highlighted when it is used as rescue mode, but there have been few randomised studies. During liquid ventilation, the lungs are filled with perfluorocarbon, which, compared to water, has low surface tension and a high solubility for respiratory gases. Clinical experience of liquid ventilation is limited, but improvements in oxygenation and lung function have been shown in short term studies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of liquid ventilation in the treatment of acute respiratory failure in children - A systematic review [O papel da Ventilação Líquida no tratamento da insuficiência respiratória aguda em crianças - Uma revisão sistemática],"Góes P.F., Troster E.J.",2006,Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,"BACKGROUND. Liquid Ventilation consists of partially or completely filling the lungs with a fluid (perfluorcarbon). This brings about elimination of the air-liquid interface and reduction of the surface tension in lungs with surfactant deficiency. This article focuses on the role of liquid ventilation in the treatment of acute respiratory failure in children. METHODS. A systematic review of literature was conducted using MEDLINE, LILACS and COCHRANE LIBRARY databases and references of articles. Match terms were: Liquid Ventilation, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Meconium Aspiration Syndrome, Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Randomized clinical trials, cohort studies and case control studies were searched for. Blood oxygenation, respiratory mechanics and survival were the outcomes evaluated. RESULTS. Two hundred eighty four publications related to liquid ventilation were selected during the study period: 19 (7.5%) were clinical trials and only six of them focused on the use of Liquid Ventilation in children. All six publications were characterized as phase I and II clinical trials and analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS. Upon analysis of these trials it was concluded that, because of the lack of controlled and randomized clinical trials, liquid ventilation cannot be recommended as a therapy for children with acute respiratory failure.",Artificial ventilation; Children; Fluorocarbons; Pulmonary alveolii; Respiratory failure,"acute disease; adolescent; article; child; clinical trial; clinical trial (topic); human; liquid ventilation; methodology; newborn; respiratory failure; Acute Disease; Adolescent; Child; Clinical Trials; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Liquid Ventilation; Respiratory Insufficiency",
Abatement of PFCs from semiconductor manufacturing processes by nonthermal plasma technologies: A critical review,"Chang M.B., Chang J.-S.",2006,Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research,"Emission of various hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and greenhouse gases including perfluorocompounds (PFCs) from semiconductor industries, which individually may cause great impact on human health and the global environment, has attracted much public attention. In this paper, a potential application of nonthermal plasma technologies as an integrated approach for abating the emission of these gaseous pollutants is critically reviewed. Relevant studies indicate that direct electron impact with PFC molecules to form PFC fragment radicals is the first step leading to the destruction of PFCs in nonthermal plasmas (NTPs) and that further reactions of PFC fragments with radicals are essential for the effective removal of PFCs. Previous studies demonstrate that nonthermal plasma combined with catalyst or adsorbent has a good potential to be used as an integrated technology for abating PFCs frojn complicated gas streams of semiconductor manufacturing processes. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,Air pollution; Environmental impact; Gaseous effluents; Greenhouse effect; Industrial emissions; Plasma applications; Semiconductor materials; Gaseous pollutants; Nonthermal plasmas (NTP); Perfluorocompounds (PFC); Semiconductor manufacturing processes; Pollution control; Air pollution; Environmental impact; Gaseous effluents; Greenhouse effect; Industrial emissions; Plasma applications; Pollution control; Semiconductor materials,
A cost-effective fabrication method for ionic polymer-metal composites,"Siripong M., Fredholm S., Nguyen Q.A., Shih B., Itescu J., Stolk J.",2006,Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings,"To date, many processes have been used for the preparation of ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) artificial muscle membranes from conductive metals and perfluorosulfonic polymers such as Nafion. The most widely used of these methods is the platinum plating process, which involves chemical reduction of ionic salt solutions. Although these chemical electroding techniques produce IPMCs with outstanding surface electrodes and excellent performance characteristics, they are relatively costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we describe a novel fabrication process for fast preparation of low-cost Ni-Au-Nafion IPMCs. The process involves the formation of an adherent surface layer on prepared Nafion through DC sputter deposition of a fine-grained gold film, followed by electroplating of a thin and ductile nickel layer in a solution of aqueous nickel salts and boric acid. Preliminary results indicate that the Nafion-117-based IPMCs produced using this technique exhibit good surface conductivity and promising actuation performance, with 20 mg, 11.5 mm × 4.7 mm cantilever bending samples showing high displacements and tip forces up to 4 grams at 4 V. Our current research efforts are focused on achieving repeatable synthesis techniques and evaluating the properties and performance characteristics of the Au-Ni-Nafion IPMCs, especially in comparison to the popular platinum IPMCs. © 2006 Materials Research Society.",,Artificial muscle membranes; Conductive metals; Ionic polymer-metal composites; Perfluorosulfonic polymers; Bending (deformation); Chemical reactions; Composite materials; Electric conductivity; Electrodes; Metal analysis; Polymers,
"Direct comparison of capillary electrophoresis and capillary liquid chromatography hyphenated to collision-cell inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for the investigation of Cd-, Cu- and Zn-containing metalloproteins","Montes-Bayon M., Pröfrock D., Sanz-Medel A., Prange A.",2006,Journal of Chromatography A,"Capillary liquid chromatography (cLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) have been critically compared for the separation of metalloproteins when using collision-cell inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-CC-MS) as detection system. For cLC separation, the selected column was a C8 (0.3 mm I.D.) and the separation conditions involved a gradient up to 80% methanol in 10 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.4). The low flow rate used (3 μL min-1) permitted the utilization of a high methanol content maintaining the sensitivity along the whole chromatographic run. For this purpose, a new low-flow interface has been developed based on a total consumption nebulizer. Similarly, CE has been studied as separation technique using a 75 μm I.D. fused silica capillary and a running buffer of 20 mM Tris-HNO3 (pH 7.4) and working at 30 kV. Metallothionein (mixture of MT-I and -II) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) have been used as protein models in order to evaluate the separation/detection capabilities using the same injection volumes in both systems (20 nL). For both hybrid systems, separation parameters such as retention factor, numbers of theoretical plates, tailing factor and resolution have been critically compared. Also, the analytical performance characteristics of both hybrid systems have been evaluated and tested by analyzing the Cu-, Zn-species present in red blood cell extracts in order to explore more adequate separation methodology for the analysis of metalloproteins in complex matrices. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Lubrication of advanced metal evaporated tape using novel perfluoropolyether lubricants,"Bhushan B., Tao Z.",2006,Microsystem Technologies,"In order to reduce the failure of advanced metal evaporated (AME) tape, novel perfluoropolyether (PFPE) lubricants, Z-TETRAOL and A20H, were deposited on an unlubricated AME tape. The degradation mechanisms of the PFPE lubricants applied on AME tape were studied using a mass spectrometer in high vacuum. The durability of various lubricants was compared using pin-on-disk experiments in high vacuum and using an accelerated tape tester in ambient air. It was found that PFPE lubricants were mainly degraded by tribochemical reaction and mechanical shear. The durability of Z-TETRAOL and A20H are higher than conventional PFPE lubricant and lubricant on experimental tape. By using ultraviolet light treatment and by applying a stearic acid overcoat, the durability of PFPE lubricants could be improved.",,Deposition; Durability; Evaporation; Lubrication; Mass spectrometers; Metal analysis; Advanced metal evaporated (AME) tapes; Mechanical shear; Pin-on-disk experiments; Tribochemical reaction; Tapes,
Palliative biliary stents for obstructing pancreatic carcinoma,"Moss A.C., Morris E., MacMathuna P.",2006,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,"Background: Palliative endoscopic stents or surgical by-pass are often required for inoperable pancreatic carcinoma to relieve obstruction of the distal biliary tree. The optimal method of intervention remains unknown. Objectives: To compare surgery, metal endoscopic stents and plastic endoscopic stents in the relief of distal biliary obstruction in patients with inoperable pancreatic carcinoma. Search methods: We searched the databases of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Group specialised register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CancerLit, Current Concepts Database and BIDS (September 2002 to September 2004). The searches were re-run in December 2005 and November 2008. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing surgery to endoscopic stenting, endoscopic metal stents to plastic stents, and different types of endoscopic plastic and metal stents, used to relieve obstruction of the distal bile duct in patients with inoperable pancreatic carcinoma. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials. Main results: Twenty-nine trials, that enrolled over 1,700 participants with pancreatic carcinoma, were included. Three eligible studies compared plastic stents to surgery. Endoscopic stenting with plastic stents was associated with a reduced risk of complications (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 - 0.81), but with higher risk of recurrent biliary obstruction prior to death (RR 18.59, 95% CI 5.33 - 64.86) when compared with surgery. There was a trend towards lower risk of 30-day mortality with plastic stents (p=0.07, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32, 1.04). One published study compared metal stents to surgery and reported lower costs and better quality-of-life with metal stents. &#x2028; &#x2028; Nine studies compared metal to plastic stents. Metal stents were associated with a lower risk of recurrent biliary obstruction than plastic stents (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.38 - 0.62). There was no significant difference in risk of technical failure, therapeutic failure, complications or 30-day mortality by meta-analysis. &#x2028; &#x2028; When different types of plastic stents were compared to polyethylene stents, only perflouro alkoxy plastic stents had superior outcomes in one trial. The addition of an anti-reflux valve improved the patency of Teflon stents. Authors' conclusions: Endoscopic metal stents are the intervention of choice at present in patients with malignant distal obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic carcinoma. In patients with short predicted survival, their patency benefits over plastic stents may not be realised. Further RCTs are needed to determine the optimal stent type for these patients.

Management of birth brachial plexus palsy,"O'Brien D.F., Park T.S., Noetzel M.J., Weatherly T.",2006,Child's Nervous System,"Introduction: The indications for surgical repair of congenital brachial plexus palsy are controversial. Our objective was to determine the results of early brachial plexus surgery following obstetric-induced brachial plexus palsy. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the outcome of 58 cases of brachial plexus surgery. The indication for operation consisted of the presence of less than antigravity strength in the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscle groups at 6 months of age. Data gathered prospectively, previously, showed the likelihood of improvement with less than antigravity strength in these cases to be poor. Results: Follow-up data were obtained on 52 of the 58 cases. Overall mean follow-up was 2 years. Twelve patients had more than 3 years follow-up (mean 5.5 years, range 3-11.5 years). Significant improvement was seen in all injury patterns i.e., C5-C6, C5-C7, and C5-C8, T1. Greater than antigravity strength in the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscle groups was seen in the majority of cases at follow-up. Conclusions: Repair of obstetrical brachial plexus palsy in children at 6 months of age that is based on less than antigravity strength in the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscle groups produces improvement in functional capabilities. Children with obstetrical brachial plexus palsy should be referred soon after birth to a center that specializes in the treatment of this type of palsy. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",Birth brachial plexus palsy; Erb's palsy; Klumpke's palsy; Sural nerve graft; Surgical treatment,biceps brachii muscle; birth injury; brachial plexus injury; cervical spine injury; clinical feature; deltoid muscle; female; follow up; functional assessment; functional status; human; infant; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; nerve graft; nerve transplantation; neurolysis; neuroma; preschool child; priority journal; retrospective study; review; sural nerve; surgical anatomy; surgical approach; surgical technique; treatment indication; treatment outcome; triceps brachii muscle; Brachial Plexus Neuropathies; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Meta-Analysis; Microsurgery; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome,
Efficient decomposition of environmentally persistent perfluorooctanesulfonate and related fluorochemicals using zerovalent iron in subcritical water,"Hori H., Nagaoka Y., Yamamoto A., Sano T., Yamashita N., Taniyasu S., Kutsuna S., Osaka I., Arakawa R.",2006,Environmental Science and Technology,"Decomposition of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and related chemicals in subcritical water was investigated. Although PFOS demonstrated little reactivity in pure subcritical water, addition of zerovalent metals to the reaction system enhanced the PFOS decomposition to form F- ions, with an increasing order of activity of no metal ≈ A1 &lt; Cu &lt; Zn ≪ Fe. Use of iron led to the most efficient PFOS decomposition: When iron powder was added to an aqueous solution of PFOS (93-372 μpM) and the mixture was heated at 350 °C for 6 h, PFOS concentration in the reaction solution fell below 2.2 μM (detection limit of HPLC with conductometric detection), with formation of F- ions with yields [i.e., (moles of F- formed)/(moles of fluorine content in initial PFOS) × 100] of 46.2-51.4% and without any formation of perfluorocarboxylic acids. A small amount of CHF3 was detected in the gas phase with a yield [i.e., (moles of CHF3)/(moles of carbon content in initial PFOS) × 100] of 0.7%, after the reaction of PFOS (372 μM) with iron at 350 °C for 6 h. Spectroscopic measurements indicated that PFOS in water markedly adsorbed on the iron surface even at room temperature, and the adsorbed fluorinated species on the iron surface decomposed with rising temperature, with prominent release of F- ions to the solution phase above 250 °C. This method was also effective in decomposing other perfluoroalkylsulfonates bearing shorter chain (C2-C 6) perfluoroalkyl groups and was successfully applied to the decomposition of PFOS contained in an antireflective coating agent used in semiconductor manufacturing. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,Derivatives; Environmental protection; Fluorocarbons; Iron; Metal analysis; Paraffins; Sulfur compounds; Fluorinated species; Reaction solution; Semiconductor manufacturing; Subcritical water; Decomposition; alkyl group; aluminum; carbon; copper; fluorine; iron; metal; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; water; zinc; Decomposition; Derivatives; Environmental protection; Fluorocarbons; Iron; Metal analysis; Paraffins; Sulfur compounds; wastewater; article; conductometry; decomposition; electrospray mass spectrometry; gas chromatography; high performance liquid chromatography; ion exclusion chromatography; mass spectrometry; reaction analysis; spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Iron; Oxidation-Reduction; Semiconductors; Water,
Investigation of perfluorinated compounds as physical solvents for selective CO2 capture at elevated pressures and temperatures,"Heintz Y.J., Lemoine R.O., Sehabiague L., Morsi B.I., Jones K.L., Pennline H.W.",2005,"22nd Annual International Pittsburgh Coal Conference 2005, PCC 2005","The objective of this study is to investigate the potential use of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) as physical solvents for selective CO 2 capture from post water-gas-shift reactor streams under elevated pressures and temperatures. A comprehensive literature review to select potential PFCs was conducted, and the equilibrium gas solubility, and the hydrodynamic and mass transfer parameters (gas holdup, Sauter mean bubble diameter, and volumetric mass transfer coefficient) for CO2 and N2 in three different PFCs, namely Perfluoro-perhydrofluorene (C 13F22), Perfluoro-perhydrophenanthrene (C 14F24), and Perfluoro-cyclohexylmethyldecalin (C 17F30), known as PP10, PP11, and PP25, respectively, were measured in a 4-liter gas-inducing agitated reactor. The transient physical gas absorption technique was employed to measure the volumetric mass transfer coefficient; and the gas solubility was determined when the thermodynamic equilibrium was reached in the reactor. The expanded liquid height method and a photographic method were used to obtain the gas holdup and the Sauter mean bubble diameter, respectively. The data were statistically designed and obtained in a gas-inducing, 4-liter Zipper- Clave agitated reactor, equipped with sight-windows in wide ranges of operating conditions: Pressures (6 - 30 bar), temperatures (300 - 500 K), mixing speeds (10 - 20 Hz), and liquid heights (0.14 - 0.22 m). The literature review revealed that the PFCs have low reactivity and high chemical stability due to the high energy of their C-F bonds. They have high boiling points and low vapor pressures because of the strength of the C-F bond and the high molecular weight. They also have no dipole and very low molecular interactions due to the repulsive tendency of fluorine atoms. The equilibrium solubilities (x*) of CO2 and N2 in PP10, PP11, and PP25, expressed in mole fraction, were found to increase with pressure at constant temperatures. The solubilities for both gases were greater in PP25 than in the other two PFCs due to its larger molecular weight when compared with those of the other two PFCs. Under similar operating conditions, the solubility of CO2 in the three PFCs appeared to be about 4 times that of N2, which was attributed to the closeness of the solubility parameter of CO2 to those of the PFCs when compared with that of N2. The results showed that CO2 is more soluble in the Selexol solvent than in the PFCs only at low temperatures (≤ 333 K). The Selexol process, however, is customarily operating at temperatures of about 312 K, indicating that the Selexol solvent would not be effective at high temperatures typifying those at the exit of the gasifier system. This study proved the thermal and chemical stability and the ability of the PFCs to selectively absorb CO2 at temperatures up to 500 K and pressures as high as 30 bar. The volumetric mass transfer coefficients (kLa) of CO 2 and N2 in PP10, PP11, and PP25, increased with increasing mixing speed, pressure, and temperature due to the increase of the gas-liquid interfacial area (a) and the liquid-side mass transfer coefficient (kL). The increase of the gas-liquid interfacial area with these operating variables was attributed to the increase of the gas holdup (εG) and the decrease of the Sauter mean bubble diameters (dS). The volumetric mass transfer coefficients of CO2 and N2 in the three PFCs, however, decreased with increasing liquid height above the impeller due to the decrease of the gas holdup and increase of the Sauter mean bubble diameter, which led to the decrease of the gas-liquid interfacial area. The volumetric mass transfer coefficients of CO2 in the three PFCs were found to be always smaller than those of N2 due to the smaller gas-liquid interfacial areas (smaller gas holdup and larger Sauter mean bubble diameter) of CO2 when compared with those of N2 under similar operating conditions. The volumetric mass transfer coefficients for CO2 and N2 in PP25 were smaller than those in PP11, and both were smaller than those in PP10, indicating that the volumetric mass transfer coefficients decrease with increasing the PFCs viscosity. Also, under the operating conditions investigated, the gas-liquid interfacial areas of CO2 and N2 in the three PFCs appeared to control the behavior of the volumetric mass transfer coefficients in the gas-inducing reactor (GIR) used.

The volumetric mass transfer coefficients of CO2 and N2 in the three PFCs, however, decreased with increasing liquid height above the impeller due to the decrease of the gas holdup and increase of the Sauter mean bubble diameter, which led to the decrease of the gas-liquid interfacial area. The volumetric mass transfer coefficients of CO2 in the three PFCs were found to be always smaller than those of N2 due to the smaller gas-liquid interfacial areas (smaller gas holdup and larger Sauter mean bubble diameter) of CO2 when compared with those of N2 under similar operating conditions. The volumetric mass transfer coefficients for CO2 and N2 in PP25 were smaller than those in PP11, and both were smaller than those in PP10, indicating that the volumetric mass transfer coefficients decrease with increasing the PFCs viscosity. Also, under the operating conditions investigated, the gas-liquid interfacial areas of CO2 and N2 in the three PFCs appeared to control the behavior of the volumetric mass transfer coefficients in the gas-inducing reactor (GIR) used. © (2005) by the International Pittsburgh Coal Conference.",,Equilibrium solubilities; Gas-liquid interfacial areas; Liquid-side mass transfer coefficients; Mass transfer parameters; Perfluorinated compound (PFCs); Perfluorinated compounds; Thermal and chemical stabilities; Volumetric mass transfer coefficient; Gas absorption; Gases; High temperature operations; Liquids; Mass transfer; Molecular weight; Solubility; Solvents; Temperature; Volumetric analysis; Carbon dioxide,
Quantitative analysis of potentially toxic metals in alginates for dental use,"Braga A.S., Catirse A.B.C.E.B., Vaz L.G., Spadaro A.C.C.",2005,Revista de Ciencias Farmaceuticas Basica e Aplicada,"Alginate is one the materials most employed in practice to make dental impressions. Substances like zinc, cadmium and lead silicate, which are included in several alginate brands with the aim of improving their physical, chemical and mechanical properties, are a source of serious concern as regards their toxicity. The most serious chronic effect of oral exposure to cadmium is renal toxicity. Assimilation of lead has deleterious effects on the gastrointestinal tract, hematopoietic system, cardiovascular system, central and peripheral nervous systems, kidneys, immune system, and reproductive system. Chronic oral exposures to zinc have resulted in hypochromic and microcyte anemia in some individuals. The aim of the present study was to measure the cadmium, lead and zinc contents of seven brands of alginate for dental use on sale in Brazil. The samples were weighed and placed in the Teflon cups of a closed-system microwave oven. Aqua regia (4mL concentrated HCI:HNO3, 3:1 v/v) and hydrofluoric acid (2mL concentrated HF) were added to the samples, which were then subjected to heating. The samples were then cooled to room temperature and diluted to 25 mL in deionized water in a volumetric glass flask. The samples were diluted in duplicate and analyzed against a reagent blank. The analyses were performed in an atomic absorption flame spectrophotometer. Neither lead nor cadmium was detected. Zinc contents ranged from 0.001% to 1.36% by weight. The alginates exhibited low contents of the metals under study and gave no cause for concern regarding toxicity; even so, it is advisable to monitor potentially toxic materials continually and to analyze their plasmatic levels in the professionals working with them.",Alginates; Cadmium; Intoxication; Irreversible hydrocolloid; Sead; Zinc,alginic acid; cadmium; hydrofluoric acid; lead; zinc; anemia; article; atomic absorption spectrometry; intoxication; nephrotoxicity; quantitative analysis,
"3-Nitrobenzanthrone, a potential human cancer hazard in diesel exhaust and urban air pollution: A review of the evidence",Arlt V.M.,2005,Mutagenesis,"Epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to diesel exhaust and urban air pollution is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. 3-Nitrobenzanthrone [3-nitro-7H-benz[de]anthracen-7-one (3-NBA)] is an extremely potent mutagen and suspected human carcinogen identified in diesel exhaust and ambient air particulate matter. The main metabolite of 3-NBA, 3-aminobenzanthrone (3-ABA), was found in the urine of salt mine workers occupationally exposed to diesel emissions, indicating that human exposure to 3-NBA due to diesel emissions can be significant and is detectable. There is clear evidence that 3-NBA is a genotoxic mutagen forming DNA adducts after metabolic activation through simple reduction of the nitro group. Several human enzymes have been shown to activate 3-NBA and its metabolites in vitro and in cells to form electrophilic arylnitrenium and rearranged carbenium ions, leading to the formation of purine adducts at the C8 and N2 position of guanine and at the C8 and N6 position of adenine. The predominant DNA adducts in vivo, 2-(2′-deoxyguanosin-N2-yl)-3- aminobenzanthrone and N-(2′-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-3-aminobenzanthrone are also the most persistent adducts in target tissue in rodents, and are most probably responsible for the induction of GC→TA transversion mutations observed in vivo. It is concluded that these adducts not only represent premutagenic lesions in DNA but are of primary importance for the initiation of the carcinogenic process and subsequent tumour formation in target tissue. Indeed, 3-NBA is carcinogenic in rats after intratracheal instillation, inducing mainly squamous cell carcinoma in lung. The intention of this article is to provide a critical review on the potential genotoxic effects of 3-NBA on human health. However, in general, there is a need for more mechanistic studies that relate 3-NBA to all processes that are considered to orchestrate tumour development and of studies on the ability of particles to promote 3-NBA genotoxicity. Because of its widespread environmental presence, 3-NBA may represent not only an occupational health hazard but also a hazard for larger sections of the general population. For an accurate risk assessment more epidemiological studies on 3-NBA-exposed individuals and a broader monitoring of environmental levels of 3-NBA are required. © The Author 2005.

"Studies on intercorrelation between selected persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and ions in sea water from the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea, Gdańsk Bay region","Polkowska Z., Astel A., Namieśnik J.",2005,Polish Journal of Environmental Studies,"The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed brackish sea with only limited water exchange with the North Sea and, thus, the North Atlantic. This salty water reservoir with water residence time of approximately 25 years is contaminated with many inorganic and organic pollutants: VOCI (Volatile Organohalogen Compounds), HC (Petroleum Hydrocarbons), OPNP (Organophosphorus and Organonitrogenous Pesticides), OCP (Organochlorine Pesticides), PAH (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) and heavy metals. Our paper presents monitoring results and sea environmental pollution assessment of the Southern Baltic coastal zone- the area of the Gdańsk Bay, based on the analysis of sea water samples. A set of various analytes were determined: PAH (16 analytes), VOCI (6 analytes), HC (9 analytes), OPNP (8 analytes), OCP (5 analytes), heavy metals (Zn, Cd, Pb, Cu). The results were subjected to full statistical evaluation. An assessment of sea environment contamination was made by characterization of pollution sources and the definition of intercorrelations between them. The characterization of major statistically important correlations between 45 variables was performed with the use of principal component analysis technique. From the performed PCA it arose that the factor configuration was similar for all sampling points and in all cases 5 factors explain over 60% of the data variance, and the statistically significant loading factors are higher than 0.7 (with p=0.05). Additionally, analysis of variance and time series analysis were applied to define important differences between chemical species' concentration levels in time and in accordance with sampling points' geographical location. As a result of time series analyses carried through with consideration to sampling points, there were no statistically important differences discovered in trends of changes from 1996 up to 1999 for any of examined groups of compounds.",Baltic Sea; Correlations; Heavy metals; Persistent organic pollutants; Sea water; Time series analysis; Volatile compounds,,
Preventing neural tube defects in Europe: A missed opportunity,"Busby A., Armstrong B., Dolk H., Armstrong N., Haeusler M., Berghold A., Gillerot Y., Baguette A., Gjergja R., Barisic I., Christiansen M., Goujard J., Steinbicker V., Rösch C., McDonnell R., Scarano G., Calzolari E., Neville A., Cocchi G., Bianca S., Gatt M., Walle H.D., Braz P., Latos-Bielenska A., Gener B., Portillo I., Addor M.-C., Abramsky L., Ritvanen A., Robert-Gnansia E., Daltveit A.K., Aneren G., Olars B., Edwards G.",2005,Reproductive Toxicology,"Each year, more than 4500 pregnancies in the European Union are affected by neural tube defects (NTD). Unambiguous evidence of the effectiveness of periconceptional folic acid in preventing the majority of neural tube defects has been available since 1991. We report on trends in the total prevalence of neural tube defects up to 2002, in the context of a survey in 18 European countries of periconceptional folic acid supplementation (PFAS) policies and their implementation. EUROCAT is a network of population-based registries in Europe collaborating in the epidemiological surveillance of congenital anomalies. Representatives from 18 participating countries provided information about policy, health education campaigns and surveys of PFAS uptake. The yearly total prevalence of neural tube defects including livebirths, stillbirths and terminations of pregnancy was calculated from 1980 to 2002 for 34 registries, with UK and Ireland estimated separately from the rest of Europe. A meta-analysis of changes in NTD total prevalence between 1989-1991 and 2000-2002 according to PFAS policy was undertaken for 24 registries. By 2005, 13 countries had a government recommendation that women planning a pregnancy should take 0.4 mg folic acid supplement daily, accompanied in 7 countries by government-led health education initiatives. In the UK and Ireland, countries with PFAS policy, there was a 30% decline in NTD total prevalence (95% CI 16-42%) but it was difficult to distinguish this from the pre-existing strong decline. In other European countries with PFAS policy, there was virtually no decline in NTD total prevalence whether a policy was in place by 1999 (2%, 95% CI 28% reduction to 32% increase) or not (8%, 95% CI 26% reduction to 16% increase). The potential for preventing NTDs by periconceptional folic acid supplementation is still far from being fulfilled in Europe. Only a public health policy including folic acid fortification of staple foods is likely to result in large-scale prevention of NTDs. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The top-level instrument calibration requirement is to measure brightness temperature to better than 1 K (3 sigma) over a broad range of atmospheric brightness temperatures, with a reproducibility of ±0.2 K. For in-flight radiometric calibration, GIFTS uses views of two on-board blackbody sources (290 K and 255 K) along with cold space, sequenced at regular programmable intervals. The blackbody references are cavities that follow the UW Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI) design, scaled to the GIFTS beam size. The cavity spectral emissivity is better than 0.998 with an absolute uncertainty of less than 0.001. Absolute blackbody temperature uncertainties are estimated at 0.07 K. This paper describes the detailed design of the GIFTS on-board calibration system that recently underwent its Critical Design Review. The blackbody cavities use ultra-stable thermistors to measure temperature, and are coated with high emissivity black paint. Monte Carlo modeling has been performed to calculate the cavity emissivity. Both absolute temperature and emissivity measurements are traceable to NIST, and detailed uncertainty budgets have been developed and used to show the overall system meets accuracy requirements. The blackbody controller is housed on a single electronics board and provides precise selectable set point temperature control, thermistor resistance measurement, and the digital interface to the GIFTS instrument. Plans for the NIST traceable ground calibration of the on-board blackbody system have also been developed and are presented in this paper.",Blackbody; Calibration; FTS (Fourier Transform Spectrometer); Imaging; Radiometric; Remote Sensing,Blackbody; Fourier Transform Spectrometers (FTS); Geosynchronous imaging fourier transform spectrometer (GIFTS); Radiometric; Calibration; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Spectrometers; Telescopes; Thermistors; Imaging systems,

Endobiliary stents for palliation in patients with malignant obstructive jaundice,Hammarström L.-E.,2005,Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology,"Background: Endobiliary drainage for malignant obstructive jaundice presents a viable palliative alternative. Its role and efficacy depend on factors related to the stent, procedure, and patient. Goals: To review the evidence in the literature in which settings plastic or metal stents are cost-effective, and whether adjuvant measures or patient-related factors affect duration of stent patency. Study: Using databases a literature search was performed for papers published from 1979 to April 2004. All retrieved papers reporting experimental or clinical observations were rated according to strength of evidence, and carefully analyzed. Results and Conclusions: Metal stents (Wallstent) stay patent longer than plastic stents (large-bore polyethylene with side-holes), overall median 250 and 110 days, respectively, and seem cost-effective in patients with longer than about 6 months survival, which cannot be accurately predicted. Antibiotics or choleretic agents do not prolong stent patency in clinical settings. In case of stent occlusion, indicated stent exchanges and insertion of a plastic stent, respectively, seem cost-effective in patients initially treated with plastic and metal stents.

"Modern and historical fluxes of halogenated organic contaminants to a lake in the Canadian arctic, as determined from annually laminated sediment cores","Stern G.A., Braekevelt E., Helm P.A., Bidleman T.F., Outridge P.M., Lockhart W.L., McNeeley R., Rosenberg B., Ikonomou M.G., Hamilton P., Tomy G.T., Wilkinson P.",2005,Science of the Total Environment,"Two annually laminated cores collected from Lake DV09 on Devon Island in May 1999 were dated using 210Pb and 137Cs, and analyzed for a variety of halogenated organic contaminants (HOCs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, short-chain polychlorinated n-alkanes (sPCAs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Dry weight HOC concentrations in Lake DV09 sediments were generally similar to other remote Arctic lakes. Maximum HOC fluxes often agreed well with production maxima, although many compound groups exhibited maxima at or near the sediment surface, much later than peak production. The lower than expected HOC concentrations in older sediment slices may be due to anaerobic degradation and possibly to dilution resulting from a temporary increase in sedimentation rate observed between the mid-1960s and 1970s. Indeed, temporal trends were more readily apparent for those compound classes when anaerobic metabolites were also analyzed, such as for DDT and toxaphene. However, it is postulated here for the first time that the maximum or increasing HOC surface fluxes observed for many of the major compound classes in DV09 sediments may be influenced by climate variation and the resulting increase in algal primary productivity which could drive an increasing rate of HOC scavenging from the water column. Both the fraction (FTC) and enantiomer fraction (EF) of trans-chlordane (TC) decreased significantly between 1957 and 1997, suggesting that recent inputs to the lake are from weathered chlordane sources. PCDD/Fs showed a change in sources from pentachlorophenol (PeCP) in the 1950s and 1960s to combustion sources into the 1990s. Improvements in combustion technology may be responsible for the reducing the proportion of TCDF relative to OCDD in the most recent slice. Crown Copyright © 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Heliox administration in the pediatric intensive care unit: An evidence-based review,"Gupta V.K., Cheifetz I.M.",2005,Pediatric Critical Care Medicine,"Objective: To provide a comprehensive, evidence-based review of helium-oxygen gas mixtures (heliox) in the management of pediatric respiratory diseases. Data source: A thorough, computerized bibliographic search of the preclinical and clinical literature regarding the properties of helium and its application in pediatric respiratory disease states. Data synthesis: After an overview of the potential benefits and technical aspects of helium- oxygen gas mixtures, the role of heliox is addressed for asthma, aerosolized medication delivery, upper airway obstruction, postextubation stridor, croup, bronchiolitis, and high-frequency ventilation. The available data are objectively classified based on the value of the therapy or intervention as determined by the study design from which the data are obtained. Conclusions: Heliox administration is most effective during conditions involving density-dependent increases in airway resistance, especially when used early in an acute disease process. Any beneficial effect of heliox should become evident in a relatively short period of time. The medical literature supports the use of heliox to relieve respiratory distress, decrease the work of breathing, and improve gas exchange. No adverse effects of heliox have been reported. However, heliox must be administered with vigilance and continuous monitoring to avoid technical complications.

Traditional suburethral sling operations for urinary incontinence in women.,"Bezerra C.A., Bruschini H., Cody D.J.",2005,Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online),"BACKGROUND: Traditional suburethral slings are surgical operations used to treat women with symptoms of stress urinary incontinence. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of traditional suburethral slings on stress incontinence alone or stress with other types of urinary (mixed) incontinence in comparison with other management options. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 22 December 2004), The UK National Research Register (Issue 1, 2001) and the reference lists of relevant articles. We hand searched the proceedings of the Brazilian Congress of Urology from 1991 to 2003, inclusive. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials that included traditional suburethral slings for the treatment of stress or mixed urinary incontinence. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All three reviewers independently extracted data from included trials onto a standard form and assessed trial methodological quality. The data abstracted were relevant to predetermined outcome measures. Where appropriate, a summary statistic was calculated: a relative risk for dichotomous data and a weighted mean difference for continuous data. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen trials were identified including 760 women of whom 627 were treated with suburethral slings. Five compared suburethral slings with open abdominal retropubic colposuspension (Burch/Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz) and one compared suburethral slings with needle suspension (Stamey). In six trials, different types of suburethral sling were compared with each other. Nine types of slings were included (Teflon, polytetrafluoroethylene, prolene used for transvaginal tape (TVT), porcine dermis, lyophilised dura mater, fascia lata, vaginal wall, autologous dermis and rectus fascia). There were no comparisons of suburethral sling with anterior repair, laparoscopic retropubic suspension, peri-urethral injections or artificial sphincters. One trial compared surgery (including slings) with anticholinergic medication.There were no statistically significant differences between traditional slings and other types of continence surgery, or between one type of traditional sling and another sling. Confidence intervals around the estimates were wide, reflecting the few data available, and so clinically important differences could not be ruled out. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The data on sub urethral sling operations remain too few to address the effects of this type of surgical treatment. Few trials are reported by authors in a complete fashion and most information came from abstracts presented in annual meetings. The broader effects of suburethral slings could not be established since trials did not include appropriate outcome measures such as general health status, health economics, pad testing, third party analysis and time to return to normal activity level. Data obtained from thirteen trials did not provide reliable estimates because of their sizes, and heterogeneity of designs, populations studied, and types of comparisons made.Reliable evidence on which to judge whether or not suburethral slings are better or worse than other surgical or conservative management is currently not available.",,"politef; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; female; human; meta analysis; methodology; randomized controlled trial; review; stress incontinence; urethra; urologic surgery; Female; Humans; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Randomized Controlled Trials; Urethra; Urinary Incontinence, Stress; Urologic Surgical Procedures",
A systematic review of contact dermatitis treatment and prevention,"Saary J., Qureshi R., Palda V., DeKoven J., Pratt M., Skotnicki-Grant S., Holness L.",2005,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,"Background: Contact dermatitis (CD) is a common occupational disease. There have been no systematic reviews of CD treatment or prevention. Methods: Multiple databases were systematically searched. Using independent double review and published quality review criteria, articles were rated as good, fair, or poor. Treatment benefit data were tabulated and conclusions were based on the rated strength of published evidence. Results: In all, 49 studies met inclusion criteria. Barrier creams containing dimethicone or perfluoropolyethers, cotton liners, and softened fabrics prevent irritant CD. Lipid-rich moisturizers both prevent and treat irritant CD. Topical skin protectant and quaternium 18 bentonite (organoclay) prevent rhus dermatitis. Diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (chelator) cream prevents nickel, chrome, and copper dermatitis. Potent or moderately potent steroids effectively treat allergic CD. There were no macrolide immunomodulator trials that met inclusion criteria. This review did not include studies of children, animals, or non-English language publications. Conclusions: A limited number of interventions effectively prevent or treat irritant and allergic CD, but well-controlled, outcome-blinded studies, particularly in the area of allergic CD prevention are needed. © 2005 by the American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.",,acetic acid derivative; azathioprine; betamethasone sodium phosphate; betamethasone valerate; bufexamac; chelating agent; chromium; clobetasol propionate; clobetasone butyrate; copper; cyclosporin; dermalex; desonide; dimeticone; doxepin; ether derivative; flumetasone pivalate; fluticasone; fluticasone propionate; hydrocortisone; immunomodulating agent; indometacin; lipid; macrolide; mometasone furoate; nickel; pentoxifylline; perfluoropolyether; steroid; tacrolimus; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; allergy; clinical trial; contact dermatitis; data base; human; humidifier; priority journal; review; systematic review,Mosby Inc.
Long-term integrity of teflon felt-supported suture lines in aortic surgery,"Strauch J.T., Spielvogel D., Lansman S.L., Lauten A.L., Bodian C., Griepp R.B.",2005,Annals of Thoracic Surgery,"Background. Although the ultimate success of aortic operations depends upon the integrity of graft-to-aorta anastomoses, little is known about different techniques used to assure their longevity. We report the incidence of reoperation for suture line disruptions arising from anastomoses using reinforcement with Teflon felt. Methods. Since 1987, 1475 patients underwent 2281 anastomoses in the thoracic aorta (mean 1.55/anastomoses per patient). All patients were followed with at least yearly computed tomographic scans, for a total follow-up of 6483.8 patient-years. Those requiring reoperation were reviewed retrospectively for evidence of suture line disruption. Results. Only 34 patients, with a mean age of 55.1 years old (range 26-85 years old) underwent reoperation for suture-line disruptions following vascular graft-to-aorta anastomosis using Teflon felt. The previous operation was a Bentall procedure in 15 (44%); ascending aorta replacement in 9 (26%); total arch replacement in 6 (18%); descending aorta replacement in 2 (6%); thoracoabdominal repair in 1 (3%); and sinus of Valsalva repair in 1 (3%). The incidence of suture line disruption was 0.0052 per patient-year, and 0.0034 per anastomosis-year. The mean interval between operations was 55.9 months (range 4-180 months). In 21%, the pseudoaneurysm originated from the proximal anastomosis; in 71% from the distal anastomosis; in 3% from both; in 3% from the innominate artery; and in 3% from a sinus of Valsalva repair. In only 1 patient was there evidence of infection. Reoperation involved ascending aorta replacement in 11 patients, and total arch replacement in 13 patients. Adverse outcome, such as hospital death or permanent stroke, occurred in 8% (3 patients). Conclusions. Use of Teflon felt to support aortic suture lines yields a very low incidence of suture line disruptions: 1 per 191 patient-years, or 1 per 296 anastomosis-years. Teflon felt reinforcement provides a secure, long-lasting graft-to-aorta anastomosis with minimal risk of infection. © 2005 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",,adult; aged; aorta sinus; aorta surgery; article; ascending aorta; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; confidence interval; controlled study; false aneurysm; human; longevity; priority journal; retrospective study; surgical technique; suturing method; thoracic aorta,Elsevier USA
Spreading and dewetting in nanoscale lubrication,"Karis T.E., Kim W.T., Jhon M.S.",2005,Tribology Letters,"This article critically reviews the fundamental scientific tools, as well as constructs cohesive schemes for potential applications, relevant to the molecularly-thin liquid film technology. Our focus is to understand the nanoscale dynamic behavior of thin lubricant films, relevant to the emerging field of nanotechnology, especially for achieving durability and reliability in the nanoscale devices. Our goal is to present a unified and hybrid description of perfluoropolyether (PFPE) experiment, mesoscopic interpretation, microscopic simulation tools, and molecular design tools available up to now. The experimentation and theory for the physicochemical properties of ultra-thin PFPE films are used to examine liquid film in the sub-monolayer to multilayer regime. Methods for extracting spreading properties from the scanning microellipsometry (SME) for various PFPE/solid surface pairs and the surface rheological characterization of PFPEs are examined. The interrelationships among SME spreading profiles, rheology, surface,energy, and tribology, are given. Mesoscopic theories, including thermodynamics of evaporation and flow, stability analysis, microscale mass transfer, and capillary waves are introduced to describe thin PFPE film dynamics. Estimation of thin film viscosity enhancement from vapor pressure suppression by dispersion force is reviewed. The method for experimental derivation of lubricant spreading profiles from contact angles is summarized. The implications of capillary waves, or thermal fluctuations, at the surface of polymeric lubricant films are also discussed. The lattice-based, simple reactive sphere Monte Carlo (MC) technique for examining the fundamentals of PFPE dynamics is illustrated. An off-lattice based bead-spring MC model is also introduced to capture a detailed internal structure of the PFPE molecules, and the molecular dynamics method is implemented for a full-scale nanostructural analysis of PFPE ultra-thin films. By systematically tuning the endgroup strengths of PFPE, we examined the physicochemical properties for thin liquid films of the various PFPE/ solid surface pairings. These tools accurately describe the static and dynamic behavior of ultra-thin liquid films consistent with experimental findings and thus are suitable for examining the fundamental mechanisms of lubrication in nanoscale devices.

Role of oxidative stress in peroxisome proliferator-mediated carcinogenesis,"O'Brien M.L., Spear B.T., Glauert H.P.",2005,Critical Reviews in Toxicology,"In this review, the evidence about the role of oxidative stress in the induction of hepatocellular carcinomas by peroxisome proliferators is examined. The activation of PPAR-α by peroxisome proliferators in rats and mice may produce oxidative stress, due to the induction of enzymes like fatty acyl coenzyme A (CoA) oxidase (AOX) and cytochrome P-450 4A1. The effect of peroxisome proliferators on the antioxidant defense system is reviewed, as is the effect on endpoints resulting from oxidative stress that may be important in carcinogenesis, such as lipid peroxidation, oxidative DNA damage, and transcription factor activation. Peroxisome proliferators clearly inhibit several enzymes in the antioxidant defense system, but studies examining effects on lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage are conflicting. There is a profound species difference in the induction of hepatocellular carcinomas by peroxisome proliferators, with rats and mice being sensitive, whereas species such as nonhuman primates and guinea pigs are not susceptible to the effects of peroxisome proliferators. The possible role of oxidative stress in these species differences is also reviewed. Overall, peroxisome proliferators produce changes in oxidative stress, but whether these changes are important in the carcinogenic process is not clear at this time.",Antioxidants; Lipid peroxidation; Oxidative DNA damage; Transcription factors,"1 mono (carboxymethylthio)tetradecane; acetylsalicylic acid; acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; antioxidant; bezafibrate; ciprofibrate; clofibrate; clofibric acid; cytochrome P450 4A1; dicamba; fenofibrate; fenoprop; fibric acid derivative; gemfibrozil; glutathione; methylclofenapate; nafenopin; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; phthalic acid dibutyl ester; pirinixic acid; pirinixil; prasterone; retinoid X receptor alpha; simfibrate; transcription factor; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; antioxidant activity; carcinogenesis; DNA damage; DNA responsive element; drug metabolism; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme induction; hepatomegaly; human; lipid peroxidation; liver cell carcinoma; nonhuman; oxidative stress; protein induction; review; species difference; Animals; Antioxidants; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; DNA Damage; Humans; Lipid Peroxidation; Liver Neoplasms; Oxidative Stress; Peroxisome Proliferators; Transcription Factors; Cavia; Primates",

"Elemental composition of springtime aerosol in Chillán, Chile","Carvacho O.F., Trzepla-Nabaglo K., Ashbaugh L.L., Flocchini R.G., Melín P., Celis J.",2004,Atmospheric Environment,"An aerosol monitoring study was established to measure ambient aerosol composition and study air pollution for one sampling site located at the University of Concepción, Chillán Campus. Chillán, a typical agricultural city in the central valley, is located in the southern Bio Bío Region of Chile. The Chillán Campus is located approximately 4 km north of the city's downtown. The aerosol monitor operated on the campus from 9 October to 9 December, 1998. The study employed an IMPROVE sampler with an Anderson PM10 inlet at 3 m collecting PM10 on 25 mm Teflon membrane filters. The filters were weighed before and after sampling to obtain mass concentration, then proton induced X-ray emission and X-ray fluorescence analysis were used to measure the concentration of 22 elements to levels below 0.68ng/m3. Moderate aerosol concentration was observed (up to 116μg/m3). The main aerosol particle source in Chillán is resuspended soil dust, which accounts for 55% of the PM10 aerosol. The presence of Br, Pb and V and other heavy metals in analyzed samples points to traffic emissions in the city. Aerosol associated with transportation activities accounts for 11% of the PM10 mass. Non-transportation organics, associated with hydrogen measured by proton elastic scattering analysis, are an important component accounting for 19% of the PM10 mass. Sulfate particles account for 3%. In addition, presence of several trace metals, including Mn, Zn, Cu, Ga, As, and Sr in our samples suggests the presence of industrial emissions in the city. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"Distribution and fractionation of heavy metals in solid waste from selected sites in the industrial belt of Delhi, India","Moturi M.C.Z., Rawat M., Subramanian V.",2004,Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,"Solid waste samples were collected from five small-scale industrial sites in the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi. These industrial sites represent the regional spread of the industrial belt in the NCT of Delhi. Solid waste samples were digested using aqua-regia and HF in air tight teflon bombs for the quantitative analysis of heavy metals (Hg, Pb, Cd, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu and Zn) by GBC model 902 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Hg was analysed using hydrid generator attachment. Beside this sequential extraction was used to fractionate five heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cd, Cu and Zn) into six operationally defined phases, viz. water soluble, exchangeable, carbonate-bound, Fe-Mn oxides, organic-bound and residual fractions to ascertain the relative mobility of these metals. The result obtained showed metal concentration to be in the range of Hg 0.42-2.3; Pb 23-530; Cd 0.14-224; Mn 494-19 964; Fe 35 684-233 119; Ni 192-1534; Cu 3065-10 144 and Zn 116-23 321 (all units in mg kg-1) in all the industrial areas studied. The fractionated toxic metals like Pb, Ni and Cd were observed to be in the range of 25-35, 15-50 and 40-50%, respectively, in mobile or bio-available fractions of solid waste. As this waste is often disposed-off by the roadsides, low lying areas, abandoned quarries or in landfill sites which are often not properly planned, thus posing potential risk to ground and surface water quality to millions of people living downstream. © Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Fractionation; Heavy metals; Small-scale; Solid waste,"Fractionation; Heavy metals; Land fill; Spectrophotometers; Water quality; Atomic absorption spectrophotometer; Toxic metals; Solid wastes; cadmium; carbonic acid; copper; heavy metal; iron; iron oxide; lead; manganese; manganese oxide; mercury; nickel; surface water; zinc; environmental risk; fractionation; heavy metal; industrial waste; solid waste; waste disposal; article; atomic absorption spectrometry; concentration (parameters); controlled study; downstream processing; environmental impact assessment; extraction; fractionation; generator; geography; India; industrialization; landfill; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; solid waste; solubility; water quality; Environmental Monitoring; India; Industrial Waste; Metals, Heavy; Refuse Disposal; Soil Pollutants; Asia; Delhi; Eurasia; India; South Asia; Hydrida",
Comparison of samplers for the biological characterization of the sea surface microlayer,"Agogué H., Casamayor E.O., Joux F., Obernosterer I., Dupuy C., Lantoine F., Catala P., Weinbauer M.G., Reinthaler T., Herndl G.J., Lebaron P.",2004,Limnology and Oceanography: Methods,"The surface film of the hydrosphere covers more than 70% of the world's surface. The sea surface microlayer (SML) or ""skin"" of the ocean is a sink for natural and anthropogenic material originating from the atmosphere and the water column. Organisms living in this SML are called ""neuston."" Our knowledge of the biology of the SML is still in its infancy. Research of the sea surface microlayer requires the use of appropriate sampling techniques and strategies, and the question of what is the most suitable device has not yet been answered. In the present study, we have compared the efficiency of the Harvey glass plate (GP) and the Garrett metal screen (MS) to analyze a wide range of microbiological parameters in SML samples collected at two coastal stations in the NW Mediterranean Sea. Two types of membranes (Teflon and polycarbonate) were also used to collect bacterioneuston. The MS was the most appropriate technique for most biological parameters providing higher enrichment factors as compared to the GP and, therefore, the highest enrichment factors compared with underlying waters (UW). Control experiments with UW demonstrated that the enrichment reported for the MS was not biased by any selectivity of the sampler itself. Therefore, we recommend the use of the MS when the aim is to compare different biological parameters. In contrast, there is clear evidence that hydrophobic and hydrophilic membranes have an important drawback and should not be used for quantification purposes. © 2014, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography.",,,American Society of Limnology and Oceanography Inc.

"Development of a New Radioligand, N-(5-Fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[ 18F]fluoroethyl-5-methoxybenzyl)acetamide, for PET Imaging of Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptor in Primate Brain","Zhang M.-R., Maeda J., Ogawa M., Noguchi J., Ito T., Yoshida Y., Okauchi T., Obayashi S., Suhara T., Suzuki K.",2004,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry,"To develop a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for imaging the 'peripheral benzodiazepine receptor' (PBR) in brain and elucidating the relationship between PBR and brain diseases, four analogues (4-7) of N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide (2) were synthesized and evaluated as ligands for PBR. Of these compounds, fluoromethyl (4) and fluoroethyl (5) analogues had similar or higher affinities for PBR than the parent compound 2 (Ki = 0.16 nM for PBR in rat brain sections). Iodomethyl analogue 6 displayed a moderate affinity, whereas tosyloxyethyl analogue 7 had weak affinity. Radiolabeling was performed for the fluoroalkyl analogues 4 and 5 using fluorine-18 (18F, β+; 96.7%, T1/2 = 109.8 min). Ligands [18F] 4 and [18F] 5 were respectively synthesized by the alkylation of desmethyl precursor 3 with [18F]fluoromethyl iodide ([18F]8) and 2-[18F] fluoroethyl bromide ([18F]9). The distribution patterns of [ 18F]4 and [18F]5 in mice were consistent with the known distribution of PBR. However, compared with [18F]5, [18F] 4 displayed a high uptake in the bone of mice. The PET image of [ 18F]4 for monkey brain also showed significant radioactivity in the bone, suggesting that this ligand was unstable for in vivo defluorination and was not a useful PET ligand. Ligand [18F]5 displayed a high uptake in monkey brain especially in the occipital cortex, a region with richer PBR than the other regions in the brain. The radioactivity level of [ 18F]5 in monkey brain was 1.5 times higher than that of [ 11C]2, and 6 times higher than that of (R)-(1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-[11C]methyl,N-(1-methylpropyl)isoquinoline ([11C]1). Moreover, the in vivo binding of [18F]5 was significantly inhibited by PBR-selective 2 or 1, indicating that the binding of [18F]5 in the monkey brain was mainly due to PBR. Metabolite analysis revealed that [18F]4 was rapidly metabolized by defluorination to [18F] F- in the plasma and brain of mice, whereas [18F]5 was metabolized by debenzylation to a polar product [ 18F]13 only in the plasma. No radioactive metabolite of [ 18F]5 was detected in the mouse brain. The biological data indicate that [18F]5 is a useful PET ligand for PBR and is currently used for imaging PBR in human brain.",,"1 (2 chlorophenyl) n methyl n (1 methylpropyl)isoquinoline c 11; benzodiazepine receptor; n (5 fluoro 2 phenoxyphenyl) n (2 fluoroethyl 5 methoxybenzyl)acetamide; n (5 fluoro 2 phenoxyphenyl) n (2 fluoroethyl 5 methoxybenzyl)acetamide f 18; n (5 fluoro 2 phenoxyphenyl) n (2 fluoromethyl 5 methoxybenzyl)acetamide; n (5 fluoro 2 phenoxyphenyl) n (2 iodomethyl 5 methoxybenzyl)acetamide; n (5 fluoro 2 phenoxyphenyl) n (5 methoxy 2 tosyloxyethylbenzyl)acetamide; radioligand; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; binding affinity; brain disease; controlled study; defluoridation; diagnostic imaging; drug binding; drug distribution; drug metabolism; drug uptake; in vivo study; isotope labeling; mouse; nonhuman; occipital cortex; positron emission tomography; primate; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; Acetamides; Animals; Brain; Fluorine Radioisotopes; Isotope Labeling; Ligands; Macaca mulatta; Male; Mice; Radioligand Assay; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, GABA-A; Tissue Distribution; Tomography, Emission-Computed",

Transcriptional Analysis of spo0A Overexpression in Clostridium acetobutylicum and Its Effect on the Cell's Response to Butanol Stress,"Alsaker K.V., Spitzer T.R., Papoutsakis E.T.",2004,Journal of Bacteriology,"Spo0A is the regulator of stationary-phase events and is required for transcription of solvent formation genes in Clostridium acetobutylicum. In order to elucidate the role of spo0A in differentiation, we performed transcriptional analysis of 824(pMSPOA) (a spo0A-overexpressing C. acetobutylicum strain with enhanced sporulation) against a plasmid control strain. DNA microarray data were contrasted to data from a spo0A knockout strain (SKO1) that neither sporulates nor produces solvents. Transcripts of fatty acid metabolism genes, motility and chemotaxis genes, heat shock protein genes, and genes encoding the Fts family of cell division proteins were differentially expressed in the two strains, suggesting that these genes play roles in sporulation and the solvent stress response. 824(pMSPOA) alone showed significant downregulation of many glycolytic genes in stationary phase, which is consistent with metabolic flux analysis data. Surprisingly, spo0A overexpression resulted in only nominal transcriptional changes of regulatory genes (abrB and sigF) whose expression was significantly altered in SKO1. Overexpression of spo0A imparted increased tolerance and prolonged metabolism in response to butanol stress. While most of the differentially expressed genes appear to be part of a general stress response (similar to patterns in two plasmid control strains and a groESL-overexpressing strain), several genes were expressed at higher levels at early time points after butanol challenge only in 824(pMSPOA). Most of these genes were related to butyryl coenzyme A and butyrate formation and/or assimilation, but they also included the cell division gene ftsX, the gyrase subunit-encoding genes gyrB and gyrA, DNA synthesis and repair genes, and fatty acid synthesis genes, all of which might play a role in the immediate butanol stress response, and thus in enhanced butanol tolerance.",,"butanol; butyric acid; DNA; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing) A; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing) B; fatty acid; solvent; article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; cell differentiation; cell division; cell motility; chemotaxis; Clostridium acetobutylicum; DNA microarray; DNA repair; DNA synthesis; fatty acid metabolism; gene control; gene expression; gene overexpression; genetic transcription; glycolysis; metabolism; nonhuman; plasmid; priority journal; regulator gene; spoOA gene; sporogenesis; stress; Bacterial Proteins; Butanols; Clostridium; Culture Media; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Heat-Shock Response; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Spores, Bacterial; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic; Bacteria (microorganisms); Clostridium; Clostridium acetobutylicum; Posibacteria; Prokaryota",

A critical overview of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in cervical cancer,"Sardi J.E., Boixadera M.A., Sardi J.J.",2004,Current Oncology Reports,"In February 1999, the National Cancer Institute of the US National Institutes of Health issued a communication stating that concurrent chemoradiotherapy should be considered as standard treatment for cervical cancer. This statement was based on the publication of five randomized prospective trials. On the basis of a critical review of these papers and others that identified different results, questions, doubts, and concerns have arisen about this therapeutic method. We analyzed the quality of the control groups managed with the standard treatment, noting data that may have altered these results, as well as analyzing the quality of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and treatment compliance. In light of this analysis, we believe that further trials should be carried out with fairly balanced prognostic factors to demonstrate beyond a doubt that concurrent chemoradiotherapy is superior to radiotherapy alone. In developing countries where resources are scarce, this type of tumor is found frequently. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy would involve increased costs and supportive care, taking away resources from other vital areas.

Respiratory distress syndrome is a potential complication for any patient that has suffered damage to the lungs. It continues to carry a significantly high mortality rate, in spite of multiple conventional treatments currently in use. The latest clinical research has led to the development of a new treatment for the syndrome called liquid ventilation, whereby chemicals called perfluorocarbons are used as a medium to transport vital respiratory gases into and out of the lungs.

This review article describes the problems of using cultured epithelial autograft and the advantages of using preconfluent keratinocytes. Despite the numerous delivery systems that have been reported, most studies are limited to animal wound bed models. There are a few small clinical studies that have demonstrated enhanced healing using mainly subjective methods.

Ligand-Exchange Detection of Phosphorylated Peptides Using Liquid Chromatography Electrospray Mass Spectrometry,"Krabbe J.G., Lingeman H., Niessen W.M.A., Irth H.",2003,Analytical Chemistry,"Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is used to selectively detect analytes with a high affinity for metal ions. The detection method is based on the selective monitoring of a competing ligand at its specific m/z value that is released during the ligand-exchange reaction of a metal-ligand complex with analyte(s) eluting from a reversed-phase liquid chromatography column. The ligand-exchange reaction proceeds in a postcolumn reaction detection system placed prior to the inlet of the electrospray MS interface. The feasibility of metal affinity detection by ESI-MS is demonstrated using phosphorylated peptides and iron(III)methylcalcein blue as reactant, as a model system. Methylcalcein blue (MCB) released upon interaction with phosphorylated peptides is detected at m/z 278. The ligand-exchange detection is coupled to a C8 reversed-phase column to separate several nonphosphorylated enkephalins and the phosphorylated peptides pp60 c-src (P) and M2170. Detection limits of 2 μM were obtained for pp60 c-src (P) and M2170. The linearity of the detection method is tested in the range of 2-80 μmol/L phosphorylated compounds (r2 = 0.9996), and a relative standard deviation of less than 8% (n = 3) for all MCB responses of the different concentrations of phosphorylated compounds was obtained. The presented method showed specificity for phosphorylated peptides and may prove a useful tool for studying other ligand-exchange reactions and metal-protein interactions.",,"Electrospray ionization; Ionization; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Phosphorus; enkephalin; iron complex; iron methylcalcein blue; ligand; metal ion; peptide; unclassified drug; article; binding affinity; chemical reaction; concentration (parameters); ligand exchange; linear system; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; molecular interaction; protein phosphorylation; reversed phase liquid chromatography; sensitivity and specificity; Chromatography, Liquid; Feasibility Studies; Ligands; Phosphopeptides; Phosphorylation; Sensitivity and Specificity; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization",
Liquid chromatographic determination of oxaliplatin in blood using post-column derivatization in a microwave field followed by photometric detection,"Ehrsson H., Wallin I.",2003,Journal of Chromatography B: Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical and Life Sciences,"Oxaliplatin ([(1R,2R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine-N,N′ ]oxalato(2-)-O,O′-platinum) is the first platinum drug with significant activity for metastatic colon cancer. The analysis of oxaliplatin has previously almost exclusively been based on the determination of the platinum content in plasma or ultrafiltrate using flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). A new method for quantitative determination of the free fraction of the intact drug in blood ultrafiltrate is presented here. Blood was ultrafiltrated centripetally at 4°C and the ultrafiltrate was analyzed by liquid chromatography. Oxaliplatin was separated on a Hypercarb column using a mobile phase of methanol/succinic acid buffer pH 7.0 (9/1, v/v). Post-column derivatization was performed by adding N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate in methanol and with microwave heating of a Teflon tubing. The derivative was quantified by photometric detection at 344nm. The coefficient of variation of standard blood samples was 4.9 and 2.5% at 0.100 and 1.00μg/ml, respectively.

Inhibitors of the complement system currently in development for cardiovascular disease,"Pugsley M.K., Abramova M., Cole T., Yang X., Ammons W.S.",2003,Cardiovascular Toxicology,"Controlled activation of the complement system is critical to the host-defense response of the immune system. Activated complement is responsible for the stimulation of a localized protective inflammatory response to either invading microorganisms or foreign molecules (toxins). However, the autologous activation of the complement system can have devastating consequences on many organ systems. This review discusses the various pathways involved in the activation of the complement system and the multiple levels of control established within the body to regulate activation. It also focuses on the role of complement activation in cardiovascular disease, especially myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury as well as in cardiopulmonary bypass procedures. Lastly, this review also provides a comprehensive overview of both biologically derived proteins and chemically developed inhibitors of the complement system that range from those that are currently in the discovery stage to those that are in clinical development as novel therapeutic agents.",BCX-1470; CAB-2; K-76; Myocardial infarction; Nafamostat; Pexelizumab; TP-10,"apt 070; bcx 1470; berinert p; CD59 antigen; classical complement pathway C3 C5 convertase; cobrotoxin; complement component C1; complement component C1q; complement component C1r; complement component C1s; complement component C1s inhibitor; complement component C3; complement component C3a; complement component C3b receptor; complement component C3d receptor; complement component C4; complement component C4b; complement component C5a receptor; complement component C5b; complement component C8; complement inhibitor; complement membrane attack complex; compstatin; gt 4086; k 76; lectin; nafamstat mesilate; pexelizumab; serine proteinase; tp 10; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; cardiopulmonary bypass; cardiovascular disease; clinical trial; complement activation; complement alternative pathway; complement inhibition; drug research; heart muscle ischemia; human; immunomodulation; nonhuman; pathophysiology; priority journal; reperfusion injury; review; signal transduction; Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; Complement Inactivator Proteins; Complement Membrane Attack Complex; Complement Pathway, Classical; Complement System Proteins; Drug Design; Humans; Lectins",

Erythropoietin in the critically ill,"Shen J., Tan I.K.S.",2003,Critical Care and Shock,"Introduction: Erythropoietin (EPO) is a recombinant human glycoprotein hormone that stimulates erythropoiesis. There is increasing experience in its use in management of anemia in the critically ill. Methods: This review focuses on clinical, experimental papers regarding erythropoietin usage in the critically ill from the Medline database. Data from our intensive care unit (ICU) were also included. Results: Anemia occurs commonly in the critically ill during ICU stay. Erythropoietin responses are blunted in MODS. EPO is an effective means of increasing haemoglobin and reduces blood transfusion. High doses 300-600U/kg of EPO produce erythropoietic responses within 6 days. For the general critical care patient, studies to date have not shown any increase in adverse events, nor any mortality benefit. Conclusion: Clinical indications include those in whom transfusion is difficult, such as Jehovah's witnesses, or patients with antibodies. Data in the critically ill support the use of 600U/kg subcutaneously weekly for 4 weeks, with adjuvant therapy of oral iron 300mg/day, vitamin C 100mg/day, folate 5mg/day and possibly vitamin E. We recommend commencing when Hct is less than 30% in patients likely to remain in the ICU beyond one week. Patients should be monitored for hypertension and haemoglobin response. Erythropoietin use is now established as an efficacious, easy to use and safe method of treating anemia in the critically ill.",,alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; blood group antibody; diaspirin crosslinked hemoglobin; folic acid; hemoglobin; iron; oxygen; perfluorooctyl bromide; recombinant erythropoietin; anaphylaxis; anemia; blood clotting disorder; blood transfusion; clinical trial; confusion; convulsion; critical illness; disease exacerbation; drug bioavailability; drug blood level; drug efficacy; drug fatality; drug half life; drug hypersensitivity; drug indication; drug megadose; drug response; drug safety; drug use; flu like syndrome; hallucination; headache; hematocrit; hemoglobin determination; human; hyperbaric oxygen; hypertension; intensive care unit; length of stay; medical literature; MEDLINE; nonhuman; pruritus; rash; religion; review; spleen infarction; thrombocytosis; thromboembolism; thrombosis; urticaria,
The use of synthetic mesh in pelvic floor defect repair,"Migliari R., De Angelis M., Pistolesi D.",2003,Urodinamica,"Utilization of synthetic materials in pelvic organ prolapse surgery, in order to achieve a tension-free repair, has become increasingly popular. Generally, the use of synthetic prosthesis, including those which are completely absorbable, such as polyglicolic acid (Dexon) and Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl), or non absorbable like Polypropilene (Marlex, Prolene), Teflon, Polytetrafluoroethylene terephtalate (Mersilene), and expanded Polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE or Goretex) has resulted in a significant reduction in post-operative pain, length of recovery period, and rate of post-operative recurrence. However, complications and results differ according to the mesh composition (monofilament vs multifilament), pore size, tensile strength and flexibility. We comprehensively reviewed the literature on the use of synthetic mesh in pelvic floor defect repair, using Medline. The conclusion is that the ideal material still has to be developed; in fact, synthetic mesh can provide durable, permanent support in pelvic floor reconstructive surgery, but the urogynaecologist must weigh the risk of complications when choosing to abandon the traditional surgical techniques that, though they are based on the use of weakened and/or damaged autologous tissue, withstand the test of time. ©2003, Editrice Kurtis.",,marlex; mersilene; politef; polyester; polyglactin; polyglycolic acid; polypropylene; bladder surgery; controlled study; cystocele; female; follow up; human; incontinence; intestine; major clinical study; materials; pelvic organ prolapse; pelvis floor; rectocele; review; surgical equipment; surgical technique; treatment outcome; urologic surgery; vagina,
High-performance liquid chromatographic assay with fluorescence detection for the simultaneous measurement of carboxylate and lactone forms of irinotecan and three metabolites in human plasma,"Owens T.S., Dodds H., Fricke K., Hanna S.K., Crews K.R.",2003,Journal of Chromatography B: Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical and Life Sciences,"Irinotecan (CPT-11), a camptothecin analog, is metabolized to SN-38, an active topoisomerase I inhibitor, and inactive metabolites, including APC and SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G). A high-performance liquid chromatographic assay method to simultaneously measure the lactone and carboxylate forms of CPT-11, SN-38, SN-38G, and APC in human plasma was developed. Chromatography was accomplished with a reversed-phase C8 column and fluorescence detection. A gradient mobile phase system was used. The buffer for mobile phase A consisted of 0.75 M ammonium acetate, 5 mM tetrabutylammonium phosphate (pH 6.0), and acetonitrile (86:14, v/v). The buffer for mobile phase B was identical to mobile phase A with the exception of the concentration (50:50, v/v). Precipitation of plasma proteins was performed with cold methanol. The linear range of detection of the lactone and carboxylate forms of SN-38, SN-38G, and APC was 2-25 ng/ml, and 5-300 ng/ml for CPT-11. The limit of quantitation for the analytes ranged from 0.5 to 5 ng/ml. Analysis of patients' plasma samples obtained before and after CPT-11 administration showed that the assay is suitable for measuring lactone and carboxylate forms of CPT-11, SN-38, SN-38G, and APC in clinical studies. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Recent advances on radical nucleophilic substitution reactions,"Rossi R.A., Postigo A.",2003,Current Organic Chemistry,"The radical nucleophilic substitution mechanism or SRN1 is a chain process, in which radicals and radical anions are intermediates. This process has been extensively used to effect substitution on a wide variety of substrates. The SRN1 reaction has been studied from both mechanistic and synthetic standpoints. The SRN1 mechanism requires an initiation step. Spontaneous electron transfer (ET) from the nucleophile to the substrate has been observed in a few systems; light stimulation, electrodes, alkali metals or inorganic salt-mediation is used otherwise. There are systems that are totally inert or undergo rather slow substitutions by classical polar mechanisms. Their lack of reactivity is usually due to strain (cycloalkyl and polycycloalkyl halides), steric (cycloalkyl, polycycloalkyl and neopentyl halides), or electronic factors (unactivated aromatic, vinyl halides and perfluoroalkyl halides). For these families of compounds, the nucleophilic substitution can be accomplished by the SRN1 mechanism. Conversely, there is a class of substrates, for which substitution can be achieved through both polar and ET mechanisms; however, the ET pathway is favored in some systems (i.e.: alkyl halides with EWG). We propose to undertake a compilation and critical review on SRN1 reactions dealing with substitutions on aromatic substrates, cycloalkyl, bridgehead, neopentyl, vinyl halides, perfluoroalkyl iodides, aliphatic substrates with EWG in the α position and N,N-dialkyl-p-toluenesulfonamides. With this aim in mind, we expect to cover recent SRN1 substitutions, with an emphasis on the scope of the process in terms of synthetic capability and target applications.",,aliphatic compound; amide; aromatic compound; ergot alkaloid; halide; indole derivative; toluenesulfonamide derivative; chemical structure; coupling factor; drug synthesis; electrode; electron transport; experimentation; methodology; polarization; radical reaction; review; substitution reaction,
Simultaneous determination of nine antiretroviral compounds in human plasma using liquid chromatography,"Turner M.L., Reed-Walker K., King J.R., Acosta E.P.",2003,Journal of Chromatography B: Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical and Life Sciences,"A rapid, sensitive and specific high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method using UV detection was developed for the determination of nine antiretroviral compounds commonly found in plasma from patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Analytes include indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, amprenavir, lopinavir, delavirdine, efavirenz, nelfinavir and its M8 metabolite. Analytes were isolated from plasma using tert.-butyl methyl ether and separation achieved via reversed-phase liquid chromatography on a C8 column with a gradient mobile phase. Detection at 210 nm provided adequate sensitivity. Limit of quantification is 50 ng/ml and all analytes demonstrated linearity across 50-10 000 ng/ml from a single 200-μl plasma sample. Recovery from plasma was consistently high (&gt;80%).

Systematic review of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of tension-free vaginal tape for treatment of urinary stress incontinence,"Cody J., Wyness L., Wallace S., Glazener C., Kilonzo M., Stearns S., McCormack K., Vale L., Grant A.",2003,Health Technology Assessment,"Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) in comparison with the standard surgical interventions currently used. Data sources: Literature searches were carried out on electronic databases and websites for data covering the period 1966-2002. Other sources included references lists of relevant articles; selected experts in the field; abstracts of a limited number of conference proceedings titles; and the Internet. Review methods: A systematic review of studies including comparisons of TVT with any of the comparators was conducted. Alternative treatments considered were abdominal retropubic colposuspension (including both open and laparoscopic colposuspension), traditional suburethral sling procedures and injectable agents (periurethral bulking agents). The identified studies were critically appraised and their results summarised. A Markov model comparing TVT with the comparators was developed using the results of the review of effectiveness and data on resource use and costs from previously conducted studies. The Markov model was used to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life-years for up to 10 years following surgery and it incorporated a probabilistic analysis and also sensitivity analysis around key assumptions of the model. Results: Based on limited data from direct comparisons with TVT and from systematic reviews, laparoscopic colposuspension and traditional slings have broadly similar cure rates to TVT and open colposuspension, whereas injectable agents appear to have lower cure rates. TVT is less invasive than colposuspension and traditional sling procedures, and is also usually performed under regional or local anaesthesia. The principal operative complication is bladder perforation. There are currently no randomised controlled trial (RCT) data beyond 2 years post-surgery, and long-term effects are therefore currently not known reliably. TVT was more likely to be considered cost-effective compared with the other surgical procedures. Increasing the absolute probability of cure following TVT reduced the likelihood that TVT would be considered cost-effective. Conclusions: The long-term performance of TVT in terms of both continence and unanticipated adverse effects is not known reliably at the moment. Despite relatively few robust comparative data, it appears that in the short to medium term TVT's effectiveness approaches that of alternative procedures currently available, and is of lower cost. As TVT is a less invasive procedure, it is possible that some women who would currently be managed non-surgically will be considered eligible for TVT. Increased adoption of TVT will require additional surgeons proficient in the technique. It is likely that some of the higher rates of complications, e.g. bladder perforation, reported for TVT are associated with a 'learning curve'. Appropriate training will therefore be needed for surgeons new to the operation, in respect of both the technical aspects of the procedure and the choice of women suitable for the operation. Further research suggestions include unbiased assessments of longer term performance from follow-up of controlled trials or population-based registries; more data from methodologically sound RCTs using standard outcome measures; a surveillance system to detect longer term complications, if any, associated with the use of tape; and rigorous evaluation before extending the use of TVT to women who are currently managed non-surgically.",,"alpha adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; biomaterial; bulking agent; cholinergic receptor blocking agent; collagen; estrogen; politef; silicon; urinary tract spasmolytic agent; bladder perforation; clinical trial; colposuspension; comparative study; health care cost; hematoma; human; laparoscopic surgery; medical literature; minimally invasive surgery; national health service; postoperative complication; probability; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; review; side effect; statistical model; statistical parameters; stress incontinence; surgical equipment; surgical technique; tension free vaginal tape; urethra surgery; urologic surgery; vagina disease; vagina reconstruction; biomedical technology assessment; colposcopy; cost benefit analysis; economics; female; methodology; prostheses and orthoses; stress incontinence; treatment outcome; urethra; vagina; Colposcopy; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Humans; Prostheses and Implants; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Technology Assessment, Biomedical; Treatment Outcome; Urethra; Urinary Incontinence, Stress; Urologic Surgical Procedures; Vagina",National Co-ordinating Centre for HTA
An update on organohalogen metabolites produced by Basidiomycetes,"Field J.A., Wijnberg J.B.P.A.",2003,Handbook of Environmental Chemistry,"Basidiomycetes are an ecologically important group of higher fungi known for their widespread capacity to produce organohalogen metabolites. To date, 100 different organohalogen metabolites (mostly chlorinated) have been identified from strains in 70 genera of Basidiomycetes. This manuscript provides an update of newly discovered chlorinated metabolites described since 1997. Additionally, the biosynthesis, physiological role, environmental fate and significance of Basidiomycete organohalogen metabolites are reviewed. Novel metabolites include chlorinated methoxybenzene azoxyformamide, pterulones (chlorinated1-benzoxepins),chlorinated anisylpropanoids, tri- and tetrachlorinated phenols. Chlorinated p-anisyl metabolites (CAM) are the most ubiquitous and ecologically significant natural organohalogens produced by higher fungi. Evidence is presented indicating their synthesis from phenylalanine via the phenylpropanoid pathway. They are estimated to be produced at a rate of 300 g ha-1 year-1 in European forests inhabited by the common occurring mushroom, Hypholoma fasciculare. Organohalogen metabolites have several purposeful physiological functions ranging from antibiotic properties, metabolites involved in lignin degradation and synthons for biosynthesis. © 2003 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Basidiomycete; Biohalogenation; Chlorinated metabolites; Fungi; Halometabolites; Organohalogen; Secondary metabolites,,Springer Verlag

Effect of perfluoropolyether oils on tribological properties of a sintered alloy,"Miyasaka M., Momono T.",2003,Toraibarojisuto/Journal of Japanese Society of Tribologists,"The tribological properties of three types of PFPE oils for a bronze-based sintered bearing alloy were examined by using the Falex tester. PFPE oils exhibited a low friction coefficient and a low wear rate compared to a hydrocarbon oil. The friction coefficient of three types of PFPE oils at the initial stage was in the following order, FM15 < DS65 < BJ60, and after 3.6ks this order did not change much. The initial results can be explained by the high reactivity of FM15 with the alloy surface.

Atomization and vaporization of lead from a blood matrix using rhodium-coated tungsten filaments with pseudo-simultaneous electrothermal atomic absorption and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric measurements,"Parsons P.J., Zhou Y., Palmer C.D., Aldous K.M., Brockman P.",2003,Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry,"In an effort to understand the pyrolysis and atomization behavior of Pb in a dilute blood matrix when determined using a tungsten filament electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometer (W-filament ETAAS), we directly coupled a W-filament ETAAS instrument (J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 2001, 16, 82) to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). The W-filament instrument was operated both as an electrothermal atomizer (ETA) and as an electrothermal vaporizer (ETV). The experimental arrangement was used to monitor simultaneously the analyte (208Pb), the permanent modifier (103Rh) coating the W surface, a surrogate for the organic components of the blood matrix (40Ar12C), and the metal atomizer (180W, 183W and 184W16O), while also measuring Pb by AAS pseudo-simultaneously. Electrothermal parameters used in the ETV/ETA experiments were precisely the same as those described previously (Spectrochim. Acta, Part B, 2002, 57, 727) for ETAAS work. This was necessary in order that the ICP-MS data could be used to observe the vaporization of analyte, matrix, modifier, and metallic atomizer throughout the electrothermal cycle. The purge gas used to transport vaporized material from the atomization cell to the ICP was Ar containing 6% H2. Pseudo-simultaneous ETAAS and ETV-ICP-MS measurements of Pb in blood were achieved using this experimental arrangement, with the MS signals appearing roughly 2 s after those by AAS, consistent with the delay caused by the 15 cm long Teflon transfer line connecting the two instruments. During pyrolysis, a strong signal observed at mass 52 is shown to be due to 40Ar12C; this signal increases as filament power for pyrolysis increases. When plotted, the data show the effective removal of much of the carbon-based matrix during pyrolysis, but without significant loss of analyte. In contrast, the pre-coated permanent modifier, Rh, is only lost during the final cleaning stage of the program in which maximum power is necessary to remove the carbonaceous matrix. However, when Rh is added to the diluent, it is lost even during pyrolysis, and at a much lower temperature. This explains why addition of Rh directly to the diluent yields no modification benefits, and why periodic re-coating of the filament surface for the analysis is necessary.",,Absorption; Atomization; Blood; Coatings; Inductively coupled plasma; Mass spectrometry; Purging; Pyrolysis; Vaporization; Electrothermal atomic absorption; Lead,
Practice and theory of enantioselective complexation gas chromatography,Schurig V.,2002,Journal of Chromatography A,"The practice and theory of enantioselective complexation GC is comprehensively reviewed for the first time. A multitude of racemic oxygen-, nitrogen- and sulfur-containing selectands can be separated without prior derivatization into enantiomers by complexation GC on optically active metal(II) bis[3-(perfluoroacyl)-(1R)-camphorate] selectors. Peak inversion is obtained when the selectors with opposite configuration are employed. Applications pertain to chiral analysis in asymmetric synthesis, enzymatic reactions, pheromone and flavour chemistry. Although the use of enantioselective complexation GC has diminished recently with the advent of modified cyclodextrins in enantioselective GC, the inherent principles of enantiorecognition together with other enantioselective phenomena can be elucidated easily by complexation GC. Using the concept of the retention-increment R′ which allows the distinction between non-enantioselective and enantioselective contributions to retention, concise thermodynamic parameters of enantioselectivity -ΔD,L(ΔG) are accessible. The enantiomerization of configurationally labile enantiomers can be investigated and quantified by complexation GC. Four distinct enantioselective processes and four different coalescence phenomena have been discerned in complexation GC. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",Chiral non-racemic metal β-diketonates; Enantiomeric separation; Enantiorecognition; Enantioselective complexation; Enantioselectivity; Isoenantioselective temperature; Reviews,"Coalescence; Derivatives; Enzymes; Gas chromatography; Nitrogen; Sulfur; Synthesis (chemical); Thermodynamics; Enantioselective complexation; Chromatographic analysis; bis[3 (perfluoroacyl)camphorate]; camphor derivative; cyclodextrin derivative; ketone derivative; metal; nitrogen; oxygen; pheromone; sulfur; unclassified drug; analytical error; asymmetric synthesis; chemical modification; chirality; complex formation; derivatization; enantiomer; enantioselectivity; enzyme mechanism; flavor; gas chromatography; intermethod comparison; kinetics; nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; quantitative analysis; racemic mixture; review; supercritical fluid chromatography; temperature dependence; theory; methodology; stereoisomerism; Chromatography, Gas; Stereoisomerism; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Stereoisomerism",

Perivascular and close intra-arterial administration of N-SMase, C2-, C8-, and C16-ceramide, but not either phosphorylcholine, C6-ceramide, nervonic (C24:1) ceramide, lignoceric (C24:0) ceramide, C8-ceramide-1-phosphate, glucosylceramide or 1-0-acylceramide, resulted in potent, concentration-dependent constriction (and spasm) of cortical venules, followed by increased leukocyte rolling, decreased leukocyte velocities, increased leukocyte-endothelial wall adhesion, increased venular wall permeability, postcapillary venule rupture and, often, micro-hemorrhaging at high concentrations; angiotensin II, serotonin and PGF2α didn't demonstrate these characteristics. Pretreatment with either one of three different antioxidants, including inhibitors of NF-κB activation, or two different Ca2+ channel blockers either prevented or attenuated the adverse venular effects of N-SMase and the ceramides. Likewise, pretreatment with either a PKCα-β antagonist or a MAP kinase antagonist also attenuated the adverse venular effects. These results suggest that N-SMase and several ceramides can result in potent venular cerebrovasospasm, leukocyte-endothelial chemoattraction, and microvessel wall permeability changes in the intact rat brain. These proinflammatory-like actions suggest that N-SMase and ceramides could produce brain-vascular damage by reperfusion injury triggering lipid peroxidation, release of reactive oxygen species and activation of diverse signaling pathways: PKCα-β isozymes, MAP kinase and NF-κB. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Use of cycloalkylcarbonyl derivatives for the determination of amino acid methyl esters by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry,"Zaikin V.G., Luzhnov V.V.",2002,Journal of Analytical Chemistry,"Cycloalkylcarbonyl (cycloalkyl = cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl) derivatives were proposed for the determination of amino acid methyl esters by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Although these derivatives exhibit lower chromatographic mobility than acetyl or perfluoroacyl derivatives, they form symmetric peaks.

Fast screening method for the determination of angiotensin II receptor antagonists in human plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection,"González L., López J.A., Alonso R.M., Jiménez R.M.",2002,Journal of Chromatography A,"A selective, accurate and precise high-performance liquid chromatographic assay coupled to fluorescence detection was developed for the detection of some angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARA II): Losartan, Irbesartan, Valsartan, Candesartan cilexetil and its metabolite Candesartan M1. The analytes and the internal standard (bumetanide, a high-ceiling diuretic) were extracted from plasma under acidic conditions by means of solid-phase extraction using C8 cartridges. This procedure allowed recoveries close to 80% for all these drugs excluding Candesartan cilexetil (70%) which presented adsorption processes on glass and plastic walls. The analytes and potential interferences were separated on a reversed-phase column, μBondapak C18, at room temperature. A gradient elution mode was used to carry out the separation, the optimal mobile phase being composed of acetonitrile-5 mM acetate buffer, pH 4, at variable flow-rates (from 1.0 to 1.2 ml/min). Fluorescence detector was set at an excitation wavelength of 250 nm and an emission wavelength of 375 nm. Intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations for all the compounds were lower than 8% except for Losartan (12%) and the method assesses a quite good accuracy (percentage of relative error ∼6% in most of the cases). The limit of quantitation for these compounds was 3 ng/ml for Candesartan cilexetil and M1, 16 ng/ml for Losartan and 50 ng/ml for Irbesartan and Valsartan, which allows their determination at expected plasma concentration levels. This assay method has been successfully applied to plasma samples obtained from hypertensive patients under clinical studies after oral administration of a therapeutic dose of some of these ARA II compounds. © 2002 Elsevier, Science B.V.

Development of environmental control technologies for 157 nm lithography at ASET,"Fukuda Y., Takeuchi S., Aoki T., Nagasaka H., Owa S., Yoshida F., Kawasa Y., Egawa K., Watanabe T., Uchino I., Sumitani A., Nakao K.",2002,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"Purging and reduction of out-gassing are very important issues that need to be treated in order to realize F2 laser lithography system. Several methods of purging are tried and out-gases from metals, O-rings, lubricants, and an adhesive are analyzed. Metal surfaces mainly release oxygen and water independent of surface roughness, Ni plating, or elements. Other substances are not detected by API-MS or GC-MS. Since O-rings are indispensable to make gas-tight structures, several kinds of O-rings made of fluoro-compounds are tested. Black fluoro-rubber o-ring, O-ting F, is recommended from the view of organic out-gassing but Teflon-based fluoro-elastomer, O-ring A, is a good candidate in terms of the water out-gassing. Greases emit a large amount of out-gases even when the samples are not irradiated by 157 nm laser. As an adhesive, Adhesive A is recommended because of the fact that it does not release as much organic and inorganic compounds which may absorb 157 nm laser light.

Hydroxylated PCB metabolites and PCBs in serum from pregnant faroese women,"Fängström B., Athanasiadou M., Grandjean P., Weihe P., Bergman Å.",2002,Environmental Health Perspectives,"In the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic, the traditional diet includes pilot whale meat and blubber and other marine food. Fatty fish and blubber of mammals may contain high concentrations of organohalogen substances (OHSs). Elevated levels of OHSs have been reported from the Faroe Islands, first documented in breast milk samples obtained in 1987. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in serum samples from pregnant Faroese women known to differ in their dietary habits. High concentrations of OH-PCBs and PCBs were found in part of the human serum samples analyzed, and the relative OH-PCB and PCB congener distributions were similar to those observed elsewhere. There was a wide span between the lowest and highest OH-PCB and PCB concentrations in the serum samples analyzed, with ranges of 19-1,800 ng/g lipid weight (lw) and 150-22,000 ng/g lw, respectively. The ratio of ∑OH-PCB/∑PCB averaged about 10% and varied little. 4-Hydroxy-2,2′,3,4′,5,5′,6-heptachlorobiphenyl was the most abundant OH-PCB metabolite in all samples analyzed, with four other OH-PCB congeners as dominating metabolites in the serum. More than 25 additional OH-PCBs were indicated.

Purification of sodium borate by continuous solvent extraction with a Teflon phase separator,"Watanabe K., Narita Y., Itagaki M.",2002,Bunseki Kagaku,"A continuous extraction method was investigated to remove MnII, FeIII, CoII and CuII from sodium borate as a pH buffer reagent. The removal of impurities in a reagent is very important to decrease the reagent blank value, which would determine mainly the limit of detection in analyses of metals. 5,7-Diiodooxine (HR) was used as an extraction reagent because it has a high distribution constant between the aqueous phase and chloroform. The extractabilities of metal ions by the proposed method {aqueous phase (100 cm3) and chloroform (40 cm3)} were estimated based on the metal concentration in a sodium borate solution determined by graphite-furnace AAS. In the present method, the HR concentration in chloroform was 1.0 × 10-3 M and the pH of the borate solution as a sample was 9.2. The organic phase containing the reagent and its metal chelates was transferred to a distillation vessel at a rate of 2.0 cm 3 min-1 after separation from the aqueous phase by a Teflon phase separator in an extraction vessel under high-speed stirring. The concentration of HR in the extraction vessel was then maintained constant by the addition of a fresh HR chloroform solution at a rate of 2.0 cm3 min-1. Above 99% of the metals as impurity could be removed after 40 min of extraction. The experimental behavior of the removal of the impurity by the present method agreed with theoretical curves calculated by using an equation derived in this study. The present method was applied to sodium borate to be reagent grade. The sodium borate obtained by the purification was used as a pH buffer reagent to determine zinc by a chemiluminescence method. Furthermore, the effect of purified sodium borate on the blank value was examined by a catalytic analysis. As a result, very low values of the reagent blank were observed by each method.","5,7-diiodooxine; Continuous solvent extraction method; Impurity; Purification; Sodium borate","5,7 diiodooxine; borate sodium; buffer; chelating agent; chloroform; cobalt; copper; ferric ion; graphite; iodine derivative; manganese; metal; metal ion; politef; reagent; solvent; unclassified drug; zinc; apparatus; article; calculation; catalysis; chemical analysis; chemical composition; chemoluminescence; concentration (parameters); distillation; experiment; furnace; liquid; pH; phase separation; purification; sample; separation technique; solvent extraction; technique; theoretical study; time; velocity",Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry

Crystal structures and thermal analysis of nedocromil bivalent metal salt hydrates,"Zhu H., Young Jr. V.G., Grant D.J.W.",2001,Journal of Chemical Crystallography,"Two transition metal salts (manganese and cobalt) of the nedocromil were prepared, and their crystal structures were elucidated in an attempt to study the influence of the nature of the bivalent cation on the structure, water interactions, and molecular packing. Crystal data: nedocromil manganese pentahydrate (NMn), triclinic, P1̄, a = 7.5351(4) Å, b = 10.3210(6) Å, c = 13.9664(8) Å, α = 86.640(1)°, β = 80.880(1)°, γ = 77.498(1)°, Z = 2; nedocromil cobalt heptahydrate (NCo), monoclinic.

Both Mn2+ and Co2+ have octahedral coordination, but the coordination environments of the cations and the bonding environments of the water molecules differ. In NMn, Mn2+ is octahedrally coordinated to two carboxylate oxygens, one in a syn orientation and the other in an anti orientation in a different asymmetric unit, and to four water molecules. In NCo, Co2+ is octahedrally coordinated to the carbonyl oxygen of the pyridone ring and to five water molecules. In NMn and NCo, the molecular conformations of the nedocromil anion are similar, with the carboxylate group on C2 almost in the same plane as the tricyclic ring, whereas the group on C8 is twisted out of the tricyclic plane. Thermal analytical data for NMn show that the water molecules in this hydrate are lost in two steps, of 4 mol and 1 mol of water, respectively. NCo also gave two dehydration steps but of about 6 mol of water and 1 mol of water, respectively.",Cobalt ion coordination; Hydrate; Manganese ion coordination; Nedocromil; Thermal analysis; Thermal dehydration; Water molecule channel,,
Design of ligands for the extraction of PtCl62- into liquid CO2,"Powell C.J., Beckman E.J.",2001,Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research,"The current solvent extraction method for refining platinum group metals (PGMs) creates contact between aqueous and organic phases and thus leads to cross-contamination. We have therefore endeavored to employ liquid carbon dioxide as the organic phase in such extractions to eliminate the waste stream deriving from organic contamination of the aqueous phase. Whereas traditional metal-binding ligands dissolve in CO2 at moderate pressures, the resulting complexes [(LH+)2MClx2-] exhibit negligible solubility in CO2 at pressures up to 400 atm. Consequently, we have designed and synthesized a series of highly CO2-soluble analogues to the metal-binding ligands currently used by the PGM-refining industry. We have measured equilibrium efficiency factors for various ligands and ligands bound to platinum. We have found that the structure of the CO2-philic component of the ligand affects the binding constant and hence that fluoroalkyls are better extractants of platinum than fluoroethers. Finally, we have noted that the phase behavior of the ligand-metal complex is a function of both the ligand structure and the identity of the metal, opening the possibility for separations based on both pressure and ligand selectivity.",,Contamination; Metals; Platinum compounds; Refining; Solvent extraction; Binding constants; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; chlorine derivative; ether derivative; ligand; platinum derivative; Carbon dioxide; liquid-liquid extraction; Platinum; refinery; Solubility; Solvent extraction; aqueous solution; article; chemical structure; extraction; metal binding; pressure; solubility,American Chemical Society
High-performance liquid chromatographic determination of bradykinin in saliva: A critical review and a new method,"Vickers E.R., Goebel C., Mather L.E., Mackay L., Wells R.J.",2001,Journal of Chromatography B: Biomedical Sciences and Applications,"Because of difficulties or dubious results with previously published methodologies, a new semi-automated HPLC method with UV absorbance detection was developed and applied to the determination of bradykinin (BK) in human saliva. The new method consisted of an uncomplicated sample preparation involving the addition to saliva of an equal volume of 0.1 M orthophosphoric acid to stabilize BK, vortex-mixing, centrifugation, and separation, followed by chromatography of the supernatant phase on a C8, 150×3.9-mm (I.D.) stainless steel column. The mobile phase was composed of 19% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at flow-rate of 0.4 ml/min. Using UV detection at 220 nm, the detection limit was 1 ng/ml for the BK standard, and 7 ng/ml for the assay of endogenous salivary BK. The orthophosphoric acid initially added to the saliva allowed BK to be stabilized from enzymic degradation at 20°C for 5 days and at 4°C for 60 days. Assignment made to the peak with the chromatographic properties of salivary BK was confirmed by HPLC-MS with an electrospray interface. This paper presents a new method that is reproducible, reliable and allows kinetic studies of salivary BK to be performed for clinical investigations. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Bradykinin,"Acetonitrile; Assays; Centrifugation; Degradation; High performance liquid chromatography; Phosphoric acid; Stainless steel; Enzymic degradation; Human saliva; Biomedical engineering; acetonitrile; benzoin; bradykinin receptor; mercaptoethanol; phosphoric acid; trifluoroacetic acid; accuracy; adult; article; centrifugation; clinical article; controlled study; drug determination; enzyme degradation; female; flow rate; high performance liquid chromatography; human; light absorption; male; mass spectrometry; normal human; pH; priority journal; reliability; reproducibility; saliva analysis; ultraviolet radiation; Acetonitriles; Bradykinin; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Mass Spectrometry; Periodontal Diseases; Reproducibility of Results; Saliva; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet",
"Effects of acid treatment on the trace metal content of chromatographic silica: Bulk analysis, surface analysis and chromatographic performance of bonded phases","Barrett D.A., Brown V.A., Watson R.C., Davies M.C., Shaw P.N., Ritchie H.J., Ross P.",2001,Journal of Chromatography A,"A series of studies has been carried out on the effect of refluxing silica chromatography particles for 0.5 h and 18 h in water, dilute hydrochloric acid and dilute hydrofluoric acid. The bulk and surface trace metal concentrations were measured by inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SSIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to determine changes in 'isolated' and 'bonded' silanol groups. The chromatographic behaviour of a series of weakly basic analytes was investigated on C8 and C18 bonded phases manufactured from the acid-treated silicas. The different reflux treatments all resulted in a reduction in the numbers of isolated silanols compared with the untreated silica and SSIMS analysis suggested that the HF-treated silicas had undergone a more efficient surface rehydroxylation. Bulk trace metals were removed most effectively by the HF treatment, with the multivalent elements (Ti and Al) being the most difficult to remove. Surface specific analysis suggested that trace metals were removed more rapidly from the surface of the silica compared to the bulk matrix and that the acid treatments resulted in halide contamination of the silica surface. Evidence is presented to suggest that the bulk metal content of the silica is not representative of the concentration of metals at the chromatographic surface. The chromatographic investigations showed that the HF-treated silica gave substantially better performance towards weak bases than the HCl-treated silicas.

Flow injection analysis of cationic metal chelate ions by an on-line concentration method using a Teflon capillary tube,"Iburaim A., Itagaki M., Watanabe K.",2001,Bunseki Kagaku,"The spectrophotometric determination of trace amounts of iron and cobalt was investigated for flow injection analysis. Cationic or polarized metal chelates were concentrated on a Teflon surface, which was treated with a 2 M NaOH solution for 3 hours. Then, the metal chelates adsorbed in the Teflon capillary tube were eluted with a solvent mixture of ethanol and 0.1 M HNO3, and determined by on-line by spectrophotometry. Cobalt(III) reacted with tridentate ligands to form stable chelate complexes, which have cationic charge in the complexes. 2-(5-Bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-[N-n-propyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl)amino]aniline, sodium salt (5-Br-PSAA) and 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphtol (PAN) were used to form cationic complexes as tridentate and mono valence ligands. The composition of the complexes obtained under the standard conditions was metal : ligand = 1 : 2. The metal complexes were concentrated for 10 min with 2.9 ml/min as the flow rate of the sample solution. As a result, the apparent molar absorption coefficients of the complexes were enhanced to 100 times as compared to each of there molar absorption coefficients. The optimum conditions were as follows: chelate complex preparation pH, 4.7; concentration pH, 8.9; eluent flow rate, 0.7 ml/min; measurement wavelength, 602 nm (Co-5-Br-PSAA), 554 nm (Fe-5-Br-PSAA), and 585 nm (Co-PAN), concentration tube length, 6 m. The cobalt was determined over the range 0.6∼50 ppb with PAN and 0.3∼10 ppb with 5-Br-PSAA; iron(III) was 0.1∼10 ppb with 5-Br-PSAA. The result of determination of iron (III) in tap water showed good agreement with the values obtained by ICP-AES. © 2001 The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry.",5-Br-PSAA; Cationic metal chelate ion; On-line concentration; PAN,,Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry
"Metabolism of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]-quinoxaline in human hepatocytes: 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline-8-carboxylic acid is a major detoxication pathway catalyzed by cytochrome P450 1A2","Langouët S., Welti D.H., Kerriguy N., Fay L.B., Huynh-Ba T., Markovic J., Guengerich F.P., Guillouzo A., Turesky R.J.",2001,Chemical Research in Toxicology,"Metabolic pathways of the mutagen 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) remain incompletely characterized in humans. In this study, the metabolism of MeIQx was investigated in primary human hepatocytes. Six metabolites were characterized by UV and mass spectroscopy. Novel metabolites were additionally characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The carcinogenic metabolite, 2-(hydroxyamino)-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, which is formed by cytochrome P450 1A2 (P450 1A2), was found to be transformed into the N2-glucuronide conjugate, N2-(β-1-glucosiduronyl)-2-(hydroxyamino)-3,8-dimethylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoxaline. The phase II conjugates N2-(3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxalin-2-yl)sulfamic acid and N2-(β-1-glucosiduronyl)-2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoxaline, as well as the 7-oxo derivatives of MeIQx and N-desmethyl-MeIQx, 2-amino-3,8-dimethyl-6-hydro-7H-imidazo-[4,5-f]quinoxalin-7-one (7-oxo-MeIQx), and 2-amino-6-hydro-8-methyl-7H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxalin-7-one (N-desmethyl-7-oxe-MeIQx), thought to be formed exclusively by the intestinal flora, were also identified. A novel metabolite was characterized as 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline-8-carboxylic acid (IQx-8-COOH), and it was the predominant metabolite formed in hepatocytes exposed to MeIQx at levels approaching human exposure. IQx-8-COOH formation is catalyzed by P450 1A2. This metabolite is a detoxication product and does not induce umuC gene expression in Salmonella typhimurium strain NM2009. IQx-8-COOH is also the principal oxidation product of MeIQx excreted in human urine [Turesky, R., et al. (1998) Chem. Res. Toxicol. 11, 217-225]. Thus, P450 1A2 is involved in both the metabolic activation and detoxication of this procarcinogen in humans. Analogous metabolism experiments were conducted with hepatocytes of untreated rats and rats pretreated with the P450 inducer 3-methycholanthrene. Unlike human hepatocytes, the rat cell preparations did not produce IQx-8-COOH but catalyzed the formation of 2-amino-3,8-dimethyl-5-hydroxyimidazo[4,5-f]-quinoxaline as a major P450-mediated detoxication product. In conclusion, our results provide evidence of a novel MeIQx metabolism pathway in humans through P450 1A2-mediated C8-oxidation of MeIQx to form IQx-8-COOH. This biotransformation pathway has not been detected in experimental animal species. Considerable interspecies differences exist in the metabolism of MeIQx by P450s, which may affect the biological activity of this mutagen and must be considered when assessing human health risk.",,"2 amino 3 methylimidazo[4,5 f]quinoline; 2 amino 3,8 dimethylimidazo[4,5 f]quinoxaline; carboxylic acid; carcinogen; cytochrome P450 1A2; mutagenic agent; animal cell; article; biotransformation; catalysis; controlled study; detoxification; exposure; gene expression; human; human cell; liver cell; metabolism; mutagen testing; nonhuman; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; rat; Salmonella typhimurium; Animalia; Salmonella typhimurium; Typhimurium",American Chemical Society
Chemical composition of fugitive dust emitters in Mexico City,"Vega E., Mugica V., Reyes E., Sánchez G., Chow J.C., Watson J.G.",2001,Atmospheric Environment,"The gravimetric and chemical composition of fugitive dust emitters of Mexico City were analyzed to determine the particulate matter source profiles. Samples of geological material, unpaved and paved roads, agricultural soil, dried lake, asphalt, cement plants, landfill, gravel, and tezontle soil, were collected directly from the ground using a broom and a dustpan. These were dried, sieved and taken through a laboratory resuspension chamber to emulate the natural wind-blown processes of bulk soils and also to provide a uniform deposit on Teflon membrane and quartz fiber filters for further gravimetric and chemical analyses of PM2.5 and PM10 size fractions. Chemical analyses of the filters included X-ray fluorescence for elemental composition, ion chromatography for water soluble anions, atomic absorption for water soluble metals, automated colorimetric analysis for ammonium and thermal/optical reflectance analysis for carbon species. The data show that most fugitive emitters are composed of 20-30% PM2.5, which is relatively less than the reported contribution by fossil fuels and biomass (40-60%).

Measurement of endocrine disruptors (environmental hormones) - Endocrine-disrupting effects and chemical analysis of hydroxylated PCBs metabolites,Kuroki H.,2001,Zairyo to Kankyo/ Corrosion Engineering,"The persistent organic pollutants and some other chemical compounds in the environment which exhibit endocrine modulating effects has attracted much attention recently. These chemicals are referred to as endocrine disruptors or environmental hormones, and a variety of chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, pesticides such as DDT, plastic additives such as bisphenol A, detergent additives such as alkylphenols are listed as the endocrine disruptors. It has also been shown that specific hydroxylated PCBs interact with the estrogen hormone and thyroid hormone systems. Several hydroxylated PCBs metabolites, which structure is resemble to that of thyroid hormone, thyroxine (T4), are determined in human blood. These observations indicate the significance of hydroxylated PCBs metabolites as potential endocrine disruptors in human.

Metabolic profiling of valproic acid by cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 enzymes using negative-ion chemical ionization gas chromatography-mass spectrometry,"Anari M.R., Burton R.W., Gopaul S., Abbott F.S.",2000,Journal of Chromatography B: Biomedical Sciences and Applications,"A sensitive negative ion chemical ionization (NCI) gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) method was modified for the quantitation of valproic acid (VPA) metabolites generated from in vitro cDNA-expressed human microsomal cytochrome P450 incubations. The use of the inherent soft ionization nature of electron-capture NCI to achieve high sensitivity enabled us to conduct kinetic studies using small amounts of recombinant human P450 enzymes. The assay is based on the selective ion monitoring of the intense [M-181] fragments of pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) esters in the NCI mode, and has the following features: (1) a micro-extraction procedure to isolate VPA metabolites from small incubation volumes (100 μl); (2) a second step derivatization with tert.-butyldimethylsilylating reagents to enhance sensitivity for hydroxylated metabolites; (3) a short run-time (&lt;30 min) while maintaining full separation of 15 VPA metabolites by using a narrow-bore non-polar DB-1 column plus a new temperature gradient; and (4) good reproducibility and accuracy (intra- and inter-assay RSDs &lt;15%, bias &lt;15%) by using seven deuterated derivatives of analytes as internal standards. The derivatives of mono- and diunsaturated metabolites, like the parent drug, produced abundant [M-181]- ions while the hydroxylated metabolites gave an ion at m/z of 273, corresponding to the [M-181]- ion of the tert.-butyldimethylsilyl ethers. In conclusion, the GC-NCI-MS analysis of valproate metabolites provided us with a high resolution and sensitivity necessary to conduct metabolic and kinetic studies of valproic acid in small volume samples typical of the in vitro cDNA-expressed micro-incubation enzymatic systems. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",Cytochrome P450; Enzymes; Valproic acid,"complementary DNA; cytochrome P450; drug metabolite; valproic acid; article; derivatization; drug metabolism; gas chromatography; human; human tissue; ion monitoring; mass spectrometry; priority journal; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; DNA, Complementary; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Humans; Kinetics; Microsomes; Reference Standards; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Valproic Acid",

Partial liquid ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome,Wiedemann H.P.,2000,Clinics in Chest Medicine,"PLV represents an intriguing alternative paradigm in the approach to the patient with ALI. Within the past decade, substantial information has become available regarding this technique. Clearly, PLV is feasible in patients with ALI and ARDS, and it appears to be safe with respect to short-term effects on hemodynamics and lung physiology, as well as long-term toxicity (although further research in this area is warranted). Although PLV has not yet been proven to be superior to traditional mechanical ventilation for patients with ALI or ARDS, PLV possesses an intriguing combination of physical, physiologic, and biologic effects: 'Liquid PEEP' effect - e.g., more effective recruitment of dependent lung zones than achieved by gas ventilation Anti-inflammatory effects Lavage of alveolar debris Mitigation of ventilator-induced lung injury Direct anti-inflammatory effects - e.g., decreased macrophage release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, etc. Prevention of nosocomial pneumonia Combination with other modalities - e.g., exogenous surfactant replacement, inhaled NO, prone position Enhanced delivery of drugs or gene vectors into the lung The results of ongoing and future clinical trials will be necessary to establish whether PLV improves clinical outcomes in patients with ALI or ARDS, or specific subgroups of such patients. Significant work also remains to be done to define the optimum dose level of PLV and the most appropriate ventilatory strategies.",,fc 77; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctyl bromide; acute respiratory tract disease; adult; animal cell; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; artificial ventilation; clinical trial; dose response; human; human cell; human tissue; infant; lamb; lung compliance; meta analysis; nonhuman; physical chemistry; pneumonia; priority journal; review,W.B.

Endoscopy in skull base surgery: ent-aspects,Magnan J.,1999,Skull Base Surgery,"The basic interest of endoscopy in skull base surgery is to reach deep and delicate areas with minimal morbidity, and to get a more comprehensive ""mapping"" of the neurovascular components running through them. Endoscopes are sterilized by autoclaving and the endoscopie procedure is monitored on a screen. Using a keyhole retrosigmoid approach the endoscopy is used in combination with the operating microscope and can be applied in various circumstances. Over the last 5 years, the distribution of disorders in 405 patients has been as follows: Acoustic neuroma (171), hemifacial spasm (182), trigeminal neuralgia (72), tinnitus (15). Endoscopie assisted microsurgical tumour removal offers an unobstructed panoramic view and allows ""looking around the corner"" and beyond the tumour. After tumour removal, it allows a safe and sure control of the internal auditory canal and of any bleeding. Endoscopie assisted microvascular decompression offers an atraumatic and precise guidance to the site of pathology, without excessive brain stem retraction, keeping intact the neurovascular relationships. Again at the end of surgery it allows a control of the efficiency of the microsurgical decompression without disturbing to the correct position of the Teflon pad.",,,
The dynamic behavior of thin-film lubricants,"Jhon M.S., Phillips D.M., Vinay S.J., Messe C.T.",1999,IEEE Transactions on Magnetics,"The dynamic behavior of thin perfluoropolyether (PFPE) films is critically reviewed. A methodology for extracting spreading information from scanning microellipsometry (SME) experiments to investigate the replenishment characteristics of various PFPEs on silica and carbon surfaces is presented. Furthermore, the relationship among SME measurements, surface energy (or disjoining pressure), rheology, and tribology is discussed. Maxwell's equal area construction is introduced into the disjoining pressure-height isotherm to correlate surface energy with the SME profile. There is a qualitative correlation at small height (h), which becomes inconsistent as h becomes large.

Heavy metals in atmospheric surrogate dry deposition,"Morselli L., Cecchini M., Grandi E., Iannuccilli A., Barilli L., Olivieri P.",1999,Chemosphere,"This paper describes a methodological approach for the assessment of the amount of surrogate dry deposition of several toxic heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) associated with atmospheric particulate matter at ground level. The objectives of the study were twofold: i) the evaluation of several techniques for the digestion of dry deposition samples for trace metal analysis; ii) the comparison of the results from two samplers with different collecting surfaces. A dry solid surface sampler (DRY sampler, Andersen - USA) and a water layer surface sampler (DAS sampler - MTX Italy) were employed. The samples were collected over a one-year period in an urban site of Bologna (northern Italy). A description is given of the complete procedure, from sampling to data elaboration, including sample storage, digestion and analytical methods. According to the results obtained with three different digestion techniques (Teflon bomb, microwave digester and Teflon flask with vapour cooling system), the highest recovery rate was achieved by the Teflon bomb procedure employing an NBS 1648 Standard Reference Material; 90-95% of the elements considered were recovered by dissolution in a pressurized Teflon bomb with an HNO3-HF mixture. Given these results, the technique was adopted for dry deposition sample digestion. On the basis of the amount of heavy metals measured as monthly deposition fluxes (μg/m2), the collecting efficiency of the DAS sampler for a number of elements was found to be as much as two to three times greater than that of the DRY sampler.",,heavy metal; analytical method; atmospheric deposition; dry deposition; heavy metal; sampling; air monitoring; air pollution; air sampling; airborne particle; article; dry deposition; Italy; methodology,
Development of a maintenance free self-lubricating ball joint,"Shuster M., Maughan G., Arnold R.",1999,SAE Technical Papers,"Vehicular suspension ball joints can be categorized in the family of tribological systems which can reduce useful service or working capacity through malfunction or breakdown. Detailed metallurgical analysis of the friction and wear mechanisms on typical ball joint bearing surfaces point to a Teflon-based woven fabric, self-lubricating liner as the best bearing material for the joint. Laboratory functional testing was conducted on modern, 4-axis test equipment simulating the applicable loading and motion conditions typically encountered in use. The self-lubricated bearing liner woven with Teflon thread demonstrated higher sustained load capacity, less rotating friction, excellent torque retention qualities and extended life in comparison to existing components utilizing greased metal-on-metal and/or ""plastic"" bearing materials. This paper describes how the advanced Fiberglide® liner technology and redesigned suspension ball joint provides superior performance and maintenance-free operation at attractive costs for mass-produced vehicle applications.

Dynamic workplans and field analytics: Metals assessment by inductively coupled plasma/optical emission spectroscopy,"Simpson R.L., III, Bock C.L., Robbat A., Jr.",1999,Remediation,"Hazardous waste site investigations were carried out at the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) in Yuma, Arizona and at Hanscom Air Force Base (HAFB) in Bedford, Massachusetts. The purpose of the first was to determine the location and extent of metals contamination throughout the base. The objective of the second was to evaluate the risk of metals contamination to groundwater from soil at three locations within the airfield. Dynamic workplans were developed and an adaptive sampling and analysis plan carried out with the data produced in the field used to support the goals of each project. An inductively coupled plasma/optical emission spectrometer (ICP/OES) was modified for field operation. A more efficient microwave digestion method and pressurized Teflon filtration system were developed for the HAFB project. Results were comparable to standard Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) methods, which must rely on two digestion procedures to recover EPA-targeted metals within the prescribed recovery range.

Reversed micellar mediated chemiluminescence reaction of luminol with metal complexes and its analytical approach,Kyaw T.,1999,Bunseki Kagaku,"The chemiluminescence (CL) reactions of luminol with complexes of bis(acetylacetonato)oxovanadium (IV) and tris(8-quinolinolato) iron (III) in a reversed micellar medium of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) have been investigated in order to develop a flow CL method for vanadium (IV) and iron(III) determinations based on the coupling of solvent extraction with reversed micellar-mediated CL detection. First, an enhancement of the CL emission was observed upon mixing the VO(acac)2 complex in chloroform with the CTAC reversed micellar solution of luminol, even when hydrogen peroxide was absent. The free VO(IV) ion produced transiently from decomposition of the complex at the reversed micellar interface is considered to catalyze the CL oxidation of luminol by dissolved oxygen. Secondly, the CL detection based on the luminoi-hydrogen peroxide CL emission, enhanced by the Fe(oxine)3 complex in reverse micelles, was combined with on-line extraction through the formation of the complex, followed by separation through a microporous Teflon membrane. In a sample solution containing Fe(II) and Fe(III), the addition of a reaction process using hydrogen peroxide to oxidize Fe(II) to Fe(III) prior to the extraction in this flow system provides for the determination of total iron, Fe(II) + Fe(III), while only Fe(III) can be determined by the absence of hydrogen peroxide.",Bis(acetylacetonato)oxovanadium(iv); Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride; Chemiluminescence; Luminol; Reversed micellar medium; Solvent extraction; Tris(8-quinolinolato)iron(iii),,Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry
Kinetics and Selectivity of the Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis: A Literature Review,"Van Der Laan G.P., Beenackers A.A.C.M.",1999,Catalysis Reviews - Science and Engineering,"A critical review of the kinetics and selectivity of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is given. The focus is on reaction mechanisms and kinetics of the water-gas shift and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactions. New developments in the product selectivity as well as the overall kinetics are reviewed. It is concluded that the development of rate equations for the FTS should be based on realistic mechanistic schemes. Qualitatively, there is agreement that the product distribution is affected by the occurrence of secondary reactions (hydrogenation, isomerization, reinsertion, and hydrogenolysis). At high CO and H2O pressures, the most important secondary reaction is readsorption of olefins, resulting in initiation of chain growth processes. Secondary hydrogenation of α-olefins may occur and depends on the catalytic system and the process conditions. The rates of the secondary reactions increase exponentially with chain length. Much controversy exists about whether these chain-length dependencies stem from differences in physisorption, solubility, or diffusivity. Preferential physisorption of longer hydrocarbons and increase of the solubility with chain length influences the product distribution and results in a decreasing olefin-to-paraffin ratio with increasing chain length. Process development and reactor design should be based on reliable kinetic expressions and detailed selectivity models.",Carbon monoxide hydrogenation; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Kinetic modeling; Product distribution; Water-gas shift,,Marcel Dekker Inc.

The enzymatic activity of this column has been previously demonstrated . This study reports on the application of the immobilized β-glucuronidase column to the analysis of glucuronide metabolites in the urine. The system utilized in this work was composed of an internal-surface reversed-phase (ISRP) column (50x4.6 mm) containing a hydrophobic inner phase and a hydrophilic outer phase, a β-glucuronidase immobilized enzyme reactor (BG-IMER) column (50x4.6 mm) and a C8 reversed-phase column (150x4.6 mm). The columns were connected with three six-port switching valves. A coupled-column procedure was developed for urine samples containing chloramphenicol-β-d-glucuronides (0.07-1.1 mM/injection). Urine samples were injected into the ISRP column where the glucuronides were separated from the biological matrix, with matrix contaminants eluting off-line to waste. Eluent from the ISRP column containing the glucuronides was then transferred on-line to the β-glucuronidase column for deconjugation and passed directly on-line to the C8 column.

Contrast echocardiographic digital analysis using HDI lab,"Cardon L.A., Odabashian J.A., Jaber W.A., Prior D.L., Vaughn S.E., Thomas J.D.",1998,Computers in Cardiology,"Echocardiographic image interpretation is predominantly a subjective process, generally performed using the 'eyeball' technique and thus critically dependent on the reviewer's experience. In the past, software packages for digital image analysis have been limited. Recently, Advanced Technology Laboratories (ATL) has introduced HDI Lab for the analysis of digital images from the A TL HDI 5000 CV ultrasound machine. The purpose of this study was to apply HDI Lab to characterize the normal patterns of echocardiographic contrast uptake into the myocardium. Only by understanding the spatial variation in contrast uptake with normal perfusion can this technique be applied to patients with coronary artery disease. Digital images were obtained from 7 normal volunteers pre and post injection of Optison, microbubbles of albumin containing perfluorocarbon gas. Apical 4 and 2 chamber images were obtained in pulse-inversion harmonic mode, gated to end-diastole of every fourth beat, and stored to either a 3.5″ magneto-optical disk (MOD) on the echo machine or to a remote PC via a network connection. Images were stored in a polar format containing data from individual scan lines and echo density quantified from regions of interest in the basal, mid and apical regions of the inferior, septal, anterior and lateral walls. Multifactorial analysis of variance demonstrated highly significant (p<0.001) increase in echogenicity of all walls indicating definite contrast presence in the myocardium. However, there was considerable variability in contrast effect with a strong (p<0.004) gradient from the base (least intense) to the apex (most intense), perhaps due to attenuation from overlying structures. Such heterogeneity of effect will have to be considered as contrast echocardiography is applied to patients with coronary artery disease.",,,
Contact stress at articular surfaces in total joint replacements.

Hence, a plethora of methods have been used by many workers not only to determine or estimate this stress but also to identify the main influencing factors. This literature is critically reviewed in the present study, which is in two parts. In this first part, the focus is on experimental methods. Two main recommendations emerge from this review.

"Fatty acids stimulate cholecystokinin secretion via an acyl chain length-specific, Ca2+-dependent mechanism in the enteroendocrine cell line STC-1","McLaughlin J.T., Lomax R.B., Hall L., Dockray G.J., Thompson D.G., Warhurst G.",1998,Journal of Physiology,"1. The present study has investigated whether fatty acids directly influence peptide release from enteroendocrine cells using STC-1, a mouse intestinal endocrine tumour cell line, previously shown to release cholecystokinin (CCK) in response to other physiological stimuli. 2. Fatty acids elicited a chain length- and dose-dependent stimulation of CCK secretion. Dodecanoic acid (C12) was most effective, producing up to a 5-fold increase in CCK secretion. Fatty acids with less than ten carbon atoms did not increase secretion. The chain length dependence of these effects mimics closely fatty acid-induced CCK secretion previously observed in humans in vivo. 3. Esterification of C12 abolished CCK secretion, indicating a critical role for a free carboxyl group in eliciting secretion. In contrast, modification of the methyl terminus had no effect on C12-induced secretion. The non-metabolizable C12 analogue 2-bromododecanoic acid was equally effective. 4. C12 elicited a marked increase in intracellular calcium levels (200-300 nM) in STC-1 cells which was abolished by the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist nicardipine.

Sample Storage Artifacts Affecting the Measurement of Dissolved Copper in Sulfidic Waters,"Simpson S.L., Apte S.C., Batley G.E.",1998,Analytical Chemistry,Sample preservation and storage procedures (acidification with HNO3 and storage in plastic bottles) normally employed prior to the determination of dissolved Cu in sulfidic waters were compared with sample preservation involving the initial oxidation of sulfide with H2O2 or S2O52- followed by acidification. Acidification alone was demonstrated to be inadequate and resulted in a significant underestimation of dissolved Cu (losses ranging from 50% to &gt;90%). Similar losses were observed in both polyethylene and Teflon storage bottles. Experiments suggest that losses of copper occur following sample acidification owing to the formation of stable copper sulfide phases which adsorb onto container surfaces. It is therefore recommended that an oxidative pretreatment step is carried out prior to the acidification of porewaters collected for metal analysis. The results of this study suggest that much of the previous data reporting dissolved Cu concentrations in sulfidic waters and porewaters may be in error.,,,American Chemical Society
"Procedure for the sample preparation and handling for the determination of amino acids, monoamines and metabolites from microdissected brain regions of the rat","Soblosky J.S., Colgin L.L., Parrish C.M., Davidson J.F., Carey M.E.",1998,Journal of Chromatography B: Biomedical Applications,"A method is described for the analysis of amino acids, monoamines and metabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED) from individual brain areas. The chromatographic separations were achieved using microbore columns. For amino acids we used a 100x1 mm I.D. C8, 5 μm column. A binary mobile phases was used: mobile phase A consisted of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.8)-methanol- dimethylacetamide (69:24:7, v/v) and mobile phase B consisted of sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.8)-methanol=dimethylacetamide (15:45:40, v/v). The flow- rate was maintained at 150 μl/min. For monoamines and metabolites we used a 150x1 mm I.D. C18 5 μm reversed-phase column. The mobile phase consisted of 25 mM monobasic sodium phosphate, 50 mM sodium citrate, 27 μM reversed- phase column. The mobile phase consisted of 25 mM monobasic sodium phosphate, 50 mM sodium citrate, 27 μM disodium EDTA, 10 mM diethylamine, 2.2 mM octane sulfonic acid and 10 mM sodium chloride with 3% methanol and 2.2% dimethylacetamide. The potential was +700 mV versus Ag/AgCI reference electrode for both the amino acids and the biogenic amines and metabolites. Ten rat brain regions, including various cortical areas, the cerebellum, hippocampus, substantia nigra, red nucleus and locus coeruleus were microdissected or micropunched from frozen 300-μm tissue slices. Tissue samples were homogenized in 50 or 100 μl of 0.05 M perchloric acid. The precise handling and processing of the tissue samples and tissue homogenates are described in detail, since care must be exercised in processing such small volumes while preventing sample degradation. An aliquot of the sample was derivatized to form that tert-butylthiol derivatives of the amino acids and γ-aminobutyric acid.

Genetic polymorphism of drug metabolizing enzymes: New mutations in CYP2D6 and CYP2A6 genes in Japanese,"Yokoi T., Kamataki T.",1998,Folia Pharmacologica Japonica,"Interindividual variation of drug effects in humans can be attributed to many factors. Among the factors, the rate of drug metabolism has been regarded as the most important one. A genetic defect of enzymes involved in drug metabolism, particularly cytochrome P450 (CYP), has been believed to be one of the important causal factors of adverse drug reactions. There are multiple gene mutations for CYP causing the poor metabolizer phenotype. The occurrence of genetic polymorphism has been seen in genes for CYP1A1, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A5. Among them, the molecular mechanisms of genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 (debrisoquine/sparteine type) and CYP2A6 (coumarin type) in Japanese have been the focus of investigations. Only 20 - 30% of the Japanese population that shows the CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotype can be diagnosed by gene analysis. By other means, we found two new mutations, CYP2D6/J9 and CYP2D6/C8, in Japanese. With regard to CYP2A6, we discovered SM-12502, a new probe drug in addition to coumarin, that is currently under development; this drug is mainly metabolized by CYP2A6. Using this drug as a probe, we found poor metabolizers and analyzed the genes for CYP2A6. We found a new mutation (CYP2A6 whole deletion) responsible for the poor metabolizer phenotype. These results should contribute to the selection of an effective drug prescription and a reduced incidence of adverse effects.",Adverse effect; Cytochrome P450; Drug metabolism; Genotype; Pharmacogenetics,"3,5 dimethyl 2 (3 pyridyl) 4 thiazolidinone; coumarin; cytochrome P450; debrisoquine; DNA; sparteine; chromosome 19; DNA polymorphism; drug metabolism; enzyme inactivation; gene mutation; human; Japan; leukocyte; pharmacogenetics; phenotype; restriction fragment length polymorphism; review",Japanese Pharmacological Society
Gender wage discrimination bias? A meta-regression analysis,"Stanley T.D., Jarrell S.B.",1998,Journal of Human Resources,"This study provides a quantitative review of the empirical literature on gender wage discrimination. Although there is considerable agreement that gender wage discrimination exists, estimates of its magnitude vary widely. Our meta-regression analysis (MRA) reveals that the estimated gender gap has been steadily declining and the wage rate calculation to be crucial. Large biases are likely when researchers omit experience or fail to correct for selection bias. Finally, there appears to be significant gender bias in gender research. However, it is a virtuous variety where researchers tend to compensate for potential bias implicit in their gender membership.

Ellipsometric determination of the structure of surface-stabilized bilayer lipid membranes on silver metal,"Chiang K.-L., Krull U.J., Nikolelis D.P.",1997,Analytica Chimica Acta,"There has been substantial interest in the use of bilayer lipid membranes as the basis for development of biosensors, but limitations in the physical stability of such membranes have prevented practical applications. The reliability and reproducibility of surface-stabilized bilayer lipid membranes (sBLMs), that have been reported to spontaneously form on metallic electrodes, may offer an attractive approach to development of a practical method of device fabrication. An important question which has been raised about sBLMs is whether the membranes an actually of a thickness of a bilayer lipid membrane. The physical structure of sBLMs have been studied indirectly by electrochemical methods, and the results show some differences from those obtained from freely suspended planar BLMs. In this present work, we report direct ellipsometric studies of the thickness of lipid films that spontaneously thin on silver metal. Silver metal was vacuum deposited on polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) polymer. Such surfaces are analogous to metal wire which is encapsulated by Teflon, as is typically used in experiments for sBLM formation. Ellipsometry of surfaces was done using a closed solution cell that allowed for hydration of lipid films. Silver surfaces that were coated with dry phospholipid, and with phospholipid in hexane:ethanol solvent, both showed that spontaneous thinning of lipid films to monolayer, bilayer and trilayer thicknesses occurred in a few minutes. There was no dependence of membrane thickness or thinning rates on the diameter of the silver metal support over the range of 3.5 to 7.5 mm used in these studies. Immobilization of silver metal onto a chromium layer that was first applied to the PVDF was important in establishing increased speed of thinning and the physical stability of the system.",Bilayer lipid membrane; Biosensors; Electrochemistry; Ellipsometry; sBLM; Silver electrode,silver; article; bilayer membrane; biosensor; controlled study; electrochemistry; electrode; lipid bilayer; lipid membrane; nonhuman; priority journal,
"2,3,7,8-Tetrafluorodibenzo-p-dioxin: A potent agonist of the murine dioxin receptor","Schmitz H.-J., Weber R., Hagenmaier A., Hagenmaier H., Poellinger L., Schrenk D.",1997,Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology,"2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons exert a pattern of toxicity related to their binding to a common receptor, the Ah (aryl hydrocarbon) or dioxin receptor. No information is available, however, on the toxicological properties of 2,3,7,8-tetrafluorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TFDD). In our experiments, TFDD was found to act as a highly potent dioxin receptor agonist leading to a transient induction of cytochrome P450(CYP)1A1 mRNA and protein in receptor-proficient mouse Hepa-1 hepatoma cells treated with 10-10 M TFDD. However, no significant induction of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity was observable in TFDD-treated Hepa-1 cells or mouse hepatocytes in primary culture, suggesting an interference with the catalytic activity of CYP1A1. Parallel experiments with 10-10 M TCDD showed a sustained induction of CYP1A1 mRNA and protein, and of EROD activity. When a reporter gene construct comprising a xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE) in 5'-position was transfected in Hepa-1c-1c-7 cells, 5 x 10-8 M TFDD and 5 x 10-9 M TCDD induced transcription to a comparable extent. Both inducers were inactive when a mutant XRE with a guanine replaced by thymine was transfected. In metabolism studies in mouse liver homogenate, TFDD was rapidly degraded in the presence of an NADPH-regenerating system, and metabolism was enhanced in liver homogenate from β-naphthoflavone-pretreated mice indicating that TFDD is metabolized in a CYP-catalyzed pathway. The open ring products dihydroxytetrafluororbiphenyl ether, and 1,2-difluoro-o-benzoquinone, probably derived from 1,2-difluorocatechol, were identified by GC-MS analysis of the incubation mixtures, whereas no phenolic metabolites and/or metabolites with an intact dioxin ring could be found. It is concluded that TFDD, in contrast to its chlorinated analogue, is metabolically unstable, and thus currently does not fulfill the criteria for the recommendation of a TCDD or toxicity equivalency factor (TEF).","2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; 2,3,7,8-Tetrafluorodibenzo-p-dioxin; Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Cytochrome P4501A1 promoter; Mouse hepatocytes","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; cytochrome p450 isoenzyme; organohalogen derivative; agonist; animal cell; animal experiment; article; controlled study; enzyme induction; hepatoma cell; liver homogenate; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; receptor binding; xenobiotic metabolism",

Endoscopic treatment of reflux by subureteric collagen injection: Critical review of 5 years' experience,"Frankenschmidt A., Katzenwadel A., Zimmerhackl L.B., Sommerkamp H.",1997,Journal of Endourology,"In the past decade, subureteric endoscopic injection of Teflon or collagen has been propagated as a safe and successful treatment for vesicoureteral reflux. In our center, from 1990 through 1995, 118 children and 5 adults with reflux and recurrent urinary tract infections were injected with cross-linked bovine collagen in an open, prospective study. Efficacy and safety were assessed 6 and 12 months after injection, and long-term (≤ 3 years) results were available in 78 cases. The overall success rate was 58% (64% of ureteral units) free from reflux at 12 months and 54% (58%) after 3 years. Analysis of anatomic, urodynamic, and technical features showed the grade of reflux to be the best predictor of success or failure. When only primary low- and middle-grade reflux, without concomitant anatomic disorders, is considered, the long-term success rate rose to 69% (74% of ureteral units). In conclusion, subureteric collagen injection cannot ultimately replace the highly effective surgical reimplantation. However, the procedure offers a minimally invasive alternative in selected cases of mild reflux when conservative management is inadequate.",,collagen; adolescent; adult; anatomy; article; child; clinical trial; conservative treatment; endoscopy; female; human; infant; major clinical study; male; minimally invasive surgery; priority journal; prospective study; reimplantation; safety; treatment outcome; urinary tract infection; urodynamics; vesicoureteral reflux,Mary Ann Liebert Inc.
Chemistry of Bifunctional Photoprobes. 1.

Selective functionalization of perfluoroaryl azides by versatile phosphorus hydrazide ligating systems 2 and 3 for the complexation of transition metals and analogous radiometals form the basis for these new agents. The utility of the photogenerated precursors from these bifunctional agents to form covalent attachments is demonstrated through examination of C-H bond insertion on cyclohexane. Representative amide-coupled phosphorus hydrazides 5 and 6 provide &gt;78% insertion of the probe into unactivated C-H bonds of cyclohexane with short photolysis times. Photoconjugation of the photoactivable heterobifunctional chelating agent 6 and its Pd metalated analog 7 with HSA is also evaluated. The uncomplexed chelate appears to add to HSA with high efficiency, consistent with the observed 82% bond insertion into model solvents. Covalent attachment of 7, evaluated through the use of 109Pd, was estimated to be between 49% and 74% with the uncertainty arising because of prephotolysis association of the 109Pd complex with HSA. The application of in situ 19F NMR to distinguish between bond insertion and noninsertion processes is demonstrated. These results suggest that functionalized perfluoroaryl azido phosphorus hydrazides may find utility as heterobifunctional photolabeling agents for attaching radionuclides to proteins and antibodies.",,chelating agent; fluorine 18; hydrazine derivative; article; drug synthesis; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,American Chemical Society
Accurate mass determination: Sensitive and volatile references for positive-ion chemical ionization and negative-ion electrospray mass spectrometry,"Fujiwara H., Chott R.C., Nadeau R.G.",1997,Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry,"Accurate mass analysis at high resolution can be used to determine elemental compositions and is often essential for conclusive metabolite identification. Reference standards can play an important role in the success of the analysis. We have discovered that perfluorinated acid anhydride/fluorinated alkylalcohol (PF-anh/F-alc) derivatives of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid are sensitively analysed by negative-ion electrospray ionization (ESI) and by positive-ion chemical ionization (CI). Based upon these results, PF-anh/F-alc derivatives of amino acids and PF-anh derivatives of primary amines were prepared, greatly expanding our collection of reference standards for accurate mass measurements. Sample ions are not suppressed since the reference standards can be selected based upon a narrow mass range of interest. They are volatile and, due to the degree of fluorination, have accurate masses favourably dose to nominal mass. They are adequately soluble in reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography solvents, making them particularly useful for ESI. Several examples of positive-ion CI and negative-ion electrospray MS accurate mass analyses of metabolites, obtained using the PF-anh/F-alc derivatives, are described.",,,

To ensure that the reactor continues to operate safely and effectively, Atomic Energy Of Canada Limited (AECL) commissioned a team in 1989 to conduct a systematic review and assessment of the reactor condition. The outcome of the study indicated that the overall condition of the reactor is good and that it is being operated safely. The study also produced recommendations as to where safety can be improved. These recommendations are the basis of the upgrade program currently being implemented in the reactor. The Second Trip System (STS) is part of the upgrade program. It is a stand alone seismically qualified trip system that operates independently from the existing first trip system (FTS) to shutdown the reactor.

Extracts of microsomal assays contained a matrix which interferes with these type of measurements. The matrix was hard to remove completely with solid phase adsorption chromatography. To overcome the problem of the interfering compounds, clean-up properties of a gel permeation chromatography system were studied for this specific matrix. The clean-up was firstly studied with model compounds and two different mobile phases. Thereupon the most appropriate mobile phase was applied to the extracts of a microsomal assay. Acetone and cyclohexane-dichloromethane (CH-DCM, 1:1, v/v) were compared as mobile phases. The elution profiles of several lipids and some organohalogen compounds (OHCs) were determined.

The amount of HF used was approximately twice the stoichiometric requirement for 33% silicon contained in the samples, assuming all silicon exists as silica. The amount of boric acid used was the stoichiometric requirement for the HF added. With a sample dilution factor of 2000 (v/m), the end solution contained ≤0.17% total dissolved solids for ICP-MS analysis.

The procedures for the flow spectrophotometric determination of Cd, Co, Cu and Fe(III) in the range 8 × 10-8 -3 × 10-5 M with on-line preconcentration are suggested. The preconcentration factors are up to 9 for the microcolumns and up to 19 for the capillary tubes. The throughput of the system is 19 samples per hour. The method of simultaneous determination of two metals in the mixture (Cu(II) and Co(II), Co(II) and Fe(III), Fe(III) and Zn, Mn(II) and Pb(II)) in the range 1 × 10-6 -7 × 10-5 M at 30-60 samples per hour is developed. © 1995.",Coated capillary tubes; Flow analysis; Metals; Spectrophotometry,cadmium; cobalt; iron; lead; manganese; metal; zinc; conference paper; drug determination; flow injection analysis; priority journal; spectrophotometry,
The effect of varying halogen substituent patterns on the cytochrome P450 catalysed dehalogenation of 4-halogenated anilines to 4-aminophenol metabolites,"Cnubben N.H.P., Vervoort J., Boersma M.G., Rietjens I.M.C.M.",1995,Biochemical Pharmacology,"The cytochrome P450 catalysed biotransformation of 4-halogenated anilines was studied in vitro with special emphasis on the dehalogenation to 4-aminophenol metabolites. The results demonstrated that a fluorine substituent at the C4 position was more easily eliminated from the aromatic ring than a chloro-, bromo- or iodo-substituent. HPLC analysis of in vitro biotransformation patterns revealed that the dehalogenation of the C4-position was accompanied by formation of non-halogenated 4-aminophenol, without formation of NIH-shifted metabolites. Changes in the apparent Vmaxfor the microsomal oxidative dehalogenation appeared to correlate with the electronegativity of the halogen substituent at C4, the fluorine substituent being the one most easily eliminated. A similar decrease in the rate of dehalogenation from a fluoro- to a chloro- to a bromo- to an iodo-substituent was observed in a system with purified reconstituted cytochrome P450 IIB1, in a tertiair butyl hydroperoxide supported microsomal cytochrome P450 system as well as in a system with microperoxidase 8. This microperoxidase 8 is a haem-based mini-enzyme without a substrate binding site, capable of catalysing cytochrome P450-like reaction chemistry. Together, these results excluded the possibility that the difference in the rate of dehalogenation with a varying C4-halogen substituent arose from a change in the contribution of cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in oxidative dehalogenation with a change in the halogen substituent. Rather, they strongly suggested that the difference was indeed due to an intrinsic electronic parameter of the various C4 halogenated anilines dependent on the type of halogen substituent. Additional in vitro experiments with polyfluorinated anilines demonstrated that elimination of the C4-fluorine substituent became more difficult upon the introduction of additional electron withdrawing fluorine substituents in the aniline-ring. 19F-NMR analysis of the metabolite patterns showed that the observed decrease in 4-aminophenol formation was accompanied by a metabolic switch to 2-aminophenols and N-hydroxyanilines, while products resulting from NIH-type mechanisms were not observed. For a C4chloro-, bromo-, or iodo-substituted 2-fluoroaniline the Vmax for the oxidative dehalogenation was reduced by the additional electron withdrawing fluorine substituent at the C2 position in a similar way. In conclusion, the results of the present study strongly indicate that the possibilities for cytochrome P450 mediated dehalogenation of 4-halogenated anilines to 4-aminophenol metabolites are dependent on: (i) the characteristics of the halogen that has to be eliminated, the most electronegative and smallest halogen being the one most easily eliminated, and (ii) the electron-withdrawing capacities of other substituents in the aromatic ring, electron-withdrawing substituents decreasing the relative rate of the reaction. Together these data lead to the conclusion that the halogen is eliminated as a halogen anion. © 1995.",aromatic hydroxylation; cytochrome P450; halogenated anilines; microperoxidase 8; N-hydroxylation; oxidative dehalogenation,"4 aminophenol; 4 bromoaniline; 4 chloroaniline; 4 fluoroaniline; 4 iodoaniline; aniline; aniline derivative; cytochrome p450 isoenzyme; halogen; unclassified drug; aerobic metabolism; animal tissue; article; biotransformation; controlled study; dehalogenation; high performance liquid chromatography; liver microsome; male; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; rat; Aminophenols; Aniline Compounds; Animal; Comparative Study; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Halogens; Kinetics; Male; Microsomes, Liver; Oxidation-Reduction; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Safrole; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
Novel reactions of perfluoroalkylphenyl sulfides with organolithium reagents,"Munavalli S., Hassner A., Rossman D.I., Singh S., Rohrbaugh D.K., Ferguson C.P.",1995,Journal of Fluorine Chemistry,"The reaction of anisole with organolithium reagents, commonly known as ortho-directed metallation, is of considerable synthetic utility in organic chemistry and as such has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Over the past 50 years, several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the observed regioselective metallation. For the first time, the reaction of perfluoroalkylphenyl sulfides with organolithium reagents has been investigated and found to furnish products resulting from the replacement of the perfluoroalkyl moieties with alkyl groups derived from the metallating agents. Phenyltrifluoromethyl ether, the anisole analog, failed to undergo metallation. A rationalization for the formation of unusual products via mediation of a single-electron-transfer process is presented in this paper together with the spectral data of the products. © 1995.",Mass spectrometry; NMR spectroscopy; Organolithium reagents; Orthometallation; Perfluoroalkylphenyl sulfides; Reactions,,
Regional brain uptake and pharmacokinetics of [123I]N-ω -fluoroalkyl-2β-carboxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane esters in baboons,"Baldwin R.M., Zea-Ponce Y., Al-Tikriti M.S., Zoghbi S.S., Seibyl J.P., Charney D.S., Hoffer P.B., Wang S., Milius R.A., Neumeyer J.L., Innis R.B.",1995,Nuclear Medicine and Biology,"Four N-ω-fluoroalkyl-2β-carboxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane esters [N-fluoroethyl, methyl ester (β-CIT-FE), N-fluoropropyl, methyl ester (β-CIT-FP), N-fluoroethyl, isopropyl ester (IP-β-CIT-FE), and N-fluoropropyl, isopropyl ester (IP-β-CIT-FP)] were labeled with123I and evaluated in baboons by dynamic SPECT regional brain imaging, measurement of pharmacokinetics in arterial plasma, and whole body imaging. The labeled tracers were prepared by iododestannylation of the corresponding 4-(trimethylstannyl) phenyl compounds in radiochemical yield 63-96% and radiochemical purity &gt; 96%. Regional SPECT brain imaging was carried out over a period of 5 h with a Strichman 810X Brain Imager to assess regional uptake in the striatum and midbrain compared to reference regions in the occipital cortex and cerebellum; arterial blood samples were taken for analysis of metabolites by solvent extraction and HPLC. The methyl esters showed higher total and specific peak uptake in the striatum than the isopropyl esters. Midbrain uptake was uniformly lower than striatal uptake and washed out more rapidly. β-CIT-FE had more rapid striatal kinetics than β-CIT-FP, with specific striatal washout rates of 10-14 vs 4-6% peak/h. Biodistribution of [123I]β-CIT-FE and [123I]β-CIT-FP measured by whole body conjugate imaging demonstrated major uptake in the brain, liver, and GI tract, with excretion occurring through both the renal and hepatobiliary routes. Absorbed radiation dose estimates based on the MIRD schema indicated highest dose rates to the urinary bladder wall and lower large intestine wall (0.7 and 0.6 rad/mCi for [123I]β-CTT-FE and 0.7 and 0.9 rad/mCi for [123I]β-CIT-FP, respectively). The high uptake in the striatum and the relative specificity with respect to cortical, midbrain, and cerebellar areas, suggest that [123I](β-CIT-FE and [123I]β-CIT-FP may be valuable tracers for studying the dopamine system in vivo by tomographic imaging. © 1995 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"dopamine transporter; iodine 123; n omega fluoroalkyl 2beta carboxy 3beta (4 iodophenyl)nortropane ester; unclassified drug; animal experiment; article; baboon; brain; controlled study; isotope labeling; pharmacokinetics; single photon emission computer tomography; Animal; Biological Transport; Brain; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Comparative Study; Iodine Radioisotopes; Male; Molecular Structure; Nortropanes; Organ Specificity; Papio; Structure-Activity Relationship; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Time Factors; Tissue Distribution; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",
Sampling and analytical methods for the determination of trace metals in surface seawater,"Nolting R.F., de Jong J.T.M.",1994,International Journal of Environmental Analytical Chemistry,"New recently implemented techniques and sample strategies for the determination of trace metals in seawater are discussed. It is shown that only with the highest precautions to prevent contamination, reliable results can be obtained. These precautions start already with the preparation of the sample bottles and sampling equipment in the laboratory. A rubber boat, Go-Flo samplers and a specially designed teflon-coated winch with Kevlar rope is used to collect the samples. At sea, the prevention of contamination of the samples is the highest priority. This implicates the use of a clean air van or at least a laminary flow bench. Acids have to be subboiling distilled in a quartz still and stored in teflon bottles. Preconcentration of the samples on board or in the home laboratory has to be done in clean rooms. This paper gives an account of current procedures used for sampling and analysing seawater for trace metal determinations. © 1994 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association)",Atlantic Ocean; Sea water sampling; trace metals,,

Cardiovascular applications of fluorocarbons in regional ischemia/reperfusion,"Kloner R.A., Hale S.",1994,"Artificial Cells, Blood Substitutes, and Biotechnology","Potential cardiovascular therapeutic uses for perfluorochemicals include oxygen delivery distal to an occluding balloon during high risk coronary angioplasties, treatment for acute myocardial infarction with or without concomitant reperfusion, cardioplegia, and preservation of donor hearts for transplant. Infusions of oxygenated perfluorochemicals during brief coronary occlusions, as occurs with angioplasties, preserves cardiac ultrastructure and cardiac function. Fluosol is currently approved in the U.S. for angioplasty procedures. Experimental studies have suggested that perfluorochemicals reduce myocardial infarct size during permanent coronary occlusion or temporary coronary occlusion. One school of thought suggests that these agents work by reducing reperfusion injury. By inhibiting neutrophil function, including adherence to endothelial cells and release of toxic substances, perfluorochemicals may preserve the endothelium and prevent no-reflow. However, one might argue that any agent which reduces infarct size by any mechanism would result in less neutrophil infiltration and smaller no-reflow areas. One pilot study suggested that intracoronary Fluosol administered at the time of reperfusion, reduced infarct size and improved regional ventricular function in patients. However, preliminary results of a large multicenter study in which this agent was given along with thrombolysis, were largely negative.Whether perfluorochemicals will become an important adjunctive agent along with reperfusion for acute myocardial infarction remains to be determined. © 1994, Informa UK Ltd.

Membrane defence against complement lysis: The structure and biological properties of CD59,"Davies A., Lachmann P.J.",1993,Immunologic Research,"The complement system is an important branch of the innate immune response, constituting a first line of defence against invading microorganisms which activate complement via both antibody-dependent and-independent mechanisms. Activation of complement leads to (a) a direct attack upon the activating cell surface by assembly of the pore-forming membrane attack complex (MAC), and (b) the generation of inflammatory mediators which target and recruit other branches of the immune system. However, uncontrolled complement activation can lead to widespread tissue damage in the host, since certain of the activation products, notably the fragment C3b and the C5b-7 complex, can bind nonspecifically to any nearby cell membranes. Therefore it is important that complement activation is tightly regulated. Our own cells express a number of membrane-bound control proteins which limit complement activation at the cell surface and prevent accidental complement-mediated damage. These include decay-accelerating factor, complement receptor 1 and membrane cofactor protein, all of which are active at the level of C3/C5 convertase formation. Until recently, cell surface control of MAC assembly had been attributed to a single 65-kD membrane protein called homologous restriction factor (alternatively named C8-binding protein and MAC-inhibiting protein). However a second MAC-inhibiting protein has since been discovered and it is now clear that this protein plays a major role in the control of membrane attack. This review charts the rapid progress made in elucidating the protein and gene structure, and the mechanism of action of this most recently discovered complement inhibitor, CD59. © 1993 Humana Press Inc.",CD59; Complement control proteins; Homologous restriction; Membrane attack complex,"cd59 antigen; complement membrane attack complex; complement receptor; autoimmunity; complement activation; etiology; human; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; priority journal; review; tissue distribution; tissue injury; Animal; Antigens, CD; Antigens, CD59; Complement Activation; Complement Inactivators; Complement Membrane Attack Complex; Human; Immunologic Diseases; Membrane Glycoproteins; T-Lymphocytes; Tissue Distribution",Humana Press
Analytical related problems in metal and trace elements determination in industrial waste landfill leachates,"Gallorini M., Pesavento M., Profumo A., Riolo C.",1993,"Science of the Total Environment, The","The periodic analytical control of waste landfill leachate is of fundamental importance not only to check the presence of possible toxic substances, but also to assess changes in concentration levels and behaviour with time. This work identifies some of the difficulties which arise during the analysis of some heavy metals and trace elements in leachate samples from a controlled industrial wastes landfill located in north Italy. The analytical problems encountered using both electro-thermal atomic absorption spectroscopy (ETAAS) and neutron activation analysis (NAA) for the determination of a series of elements, Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni, Mn, V, As, Se, Sb, Th, Sn, Cs, W, Cr, with concentration often at nanogram levels, are presented and evaluated. To solve these problems two selective chemical procedures have been developed to separate and to eliminate the matrix interfering compounds or elements (i.e., organic matter, complexing agents, Cl-, Br-, S2-, Na+) which reduce and in some cases impair the sensitivity of the technique. For the analyses by ETAAS a preliminary preconcentration and separation procedure, based on the ion exchange resin Chelex-100 has been developed to determine Pb, Cd, Co, Cu, Ni and Sn. In the case of NAA a specific radiochemical separation had to be studied for the analysis of Sn, V, W, Mn, Cr, As, Sb, Se, Th in presence of high bromine and sodium concentrations. Procedures blanks and yields have been controlled and evaluated and quality assurance measurements have been carried out analyzing, with the proposed methods, standard reference materials from BCR and NIST. Furthermore, different mineralization procedures using both microwave and Teflon bomb have been compared and evaluated. © 1993.",atomic absorption spectroscopy; landfill; metals and trace elements; neutron activation analysis; precipitation; waste,atomic absorption spectroscopy; heavy metals; landfill; leachate; monitoring; neutron activation analysis; Italy; article; atomic absorption spectrometry; controlled study; landfill; neutron activation analysis; pollution; waste disposal,
Study on Adhesion and Removal of Metallic Impurities on a Perfluoroalkoxy Resin Surface,"Ohtani K., Ohmi T.",1993,Journal of the Electrochemical Society,"The adhesion and removal behavior of metallic impurities on a PFA sheet surface was examined with TRXRF analysis. Metals such as Fe and Cu are strongly adhered, and they can be removed to some extent by SPM or FPM cleaning. The surface metallic concentration of PFA sheets did not increase when they were dipped into UPW or chemicals contaminated with metals, therefore it is assumed that metallic impurities do not adhere to the PFA surface from liquids. Moreover the metallic transfer tests showed that a cleaned PFA sheet did not contaminate Si wafers but an uncleaned sheet polluted the wafer strongly with metallic impurities. Therefore, when PFA molded parts such as wafer carriers and tubes are used in wet processing in semiconductor manufacturing, they must be cleaned by SPM or FPM cleaning. © 1993, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

Determination of metal ions as EDTA complexes by reversed-phase ion-pair liquid chromatography,"Jen J.-F., Chen C.-S.",1992,Analytica Chimica Acta,"A reversed-phase ion-pair liquid chromatographic method was developed for the determination of metal ions in aqueous solution. Metal ions were first chelated with EDTA, followed by injection into the chromatographic system. A reversed-phase C8 column was used to separate the chelate ions with an eluent consisting of acetonitrile-water mixture (8 + 92, v/v) containing 0.002 M tetrabutylammonium as the counter ion. UV detection at 242 nm was applied. Factors affecting the ion-pair formation and the chromatographic separation were studied. This method can be applied to the determination of metal ions such as Pb, Ni, Cd, Fe and Cu. The linear dynamic range is larger than two orders of magnitude, the detection limit is at the ng ml-1 level and the R.S.D. is ca. 3% at mid-calibration range. The method has been successfully used in metal analysis of electroplating waste water. The results are comparable to those of atomic absorption spectrometry. © 1992.",EDTA complexes; Ion chromatography; Liquid chromatography; Metal ions,chromium; cobalt; copper; edetic acid; iron; lead; metal ion; nickel; article; complex formation; ion pair chromatography; liquid chromatography; reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; waste water; water analysis,

"The semipermeable surface, a new restricted access medium","Glunz L.J., Invergo B., Glunz P.W., Szczerba T.J., Rateike J.D.",1992,Journal of Liquid Chromatography,"The Internal Surface Reversed Phase (ISRP)–an elegant invention of Dr. Thomas C. Pinkerton–was the first example of a Restricted Access Medium (RAM). These materials allow the determination of small molecules in the presence of large biomolecules, for instance the direct injection of serum into an HPLC column without requiring prior removal of protein. A new RAM is the SemiPermeable Surface (SPS), based on the doctoral research of Carla Desilets under Dr. Fred Regnier at Purdue University, developed to its present form at the Regis Chemical Company. The SPS has two phases: an outer and an inner, each independently synthesized, each covalently bound to the silica surface of the packing particle. The outer is a hydrophilic polyoxyethylene polymer; the inner is any of several common hydrophobic reversed phases (at present, C8, C18, nitrile, phenyl). The outer phase forms a semipermeable surface that prevents large biopolymers from reaching the inner phase. Small molecules, however, can and do interact with either the outer or the inner phase. They are retained by a unique mechanism–a combination of hydrogen bonding at the outer polyoxyethylene surface and hydrophobic interaction at the inner reversed phase. Aside from its experimentally variable selectivity-a completely new property-SPS also shows excellent chromatographic efficiency and roughly twice the retentivity of comparable RAM materials. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The specific materials tested were: i)CP Titanium Screen ii) 304L Stainless Steel Screen iii) CP Titanium Frame (Foil) attached to CP Titanium Screen iv) CP Titanium Frame (Foil) attached to 304L Stainless Steel Screen v) Tltan1um-6AL-4V Tubing vi) 304L Stainless Steel Tubing vii) Titanium-6Al-4V Tubing attached to 304L Stainless Steel Tubing Portions of an analysed stock MON-3 were utilised for conventional exposure and electrochemical corrosion tests with select material specimens. Inert (glass/TefIon) vessels were used for the exposure tests. A.C. impedance equipment was used for the electrochemical tests. The more useful data were obtained from the imersion tests. In these, ""blanks"" (no test specimens) were Included to provide baseline data. The S/V (Surface-of-metal-to- Volume-of-liquid) ratios employed are stipulated. All tests were carried out at 90°F (32°C). Tests of three different durations, 44, 90 and 180 days, ware conducted for each MON-3/Metal combination. Data for 0 days exposure were obtained fros test specimen “blanks” (no MON-3 exposure). The parameters defined reasonable values for S/V, temperature and time in terms of the intended application, communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit for minimum of seven years. In all cases, precisely the same techniques were employed by the same anatyst, for the pre and post test analyses.Construction of the test vessels, by design, was such as to allow prefiltration of propellant post test to a degree used In commercial production, 10-40 microns. This allowed separation of propellant from metal for analyses of effects on the metal by contact with the propellant, and vice versa. The propellant was filtered through stack of three, tared Teflon membranes. The top membrane had a pore tile rating of 5 microns. The underlying membrane pore sizes were in the colloid size range of 0.2 micron. Weight changes of the separate membranes provided data concerning the size of particles generated during test and the presence of colloids. Optical microscopic analyses, at x4G, of the particles retained by the 5 micron membrane, coupled with files of “knowns” and supplemented with analyses of particles of questionable composition, allowed identification of specific corrosion products and their likely source. Atomic absorption analyses of filtrates allowed monitoring of corrosion of given element from a given alloy, as a function of time. In search of accelerating, galvanic effects.Test specimens were subjected, systematically, to metallurgical and electron spectroscopy analyses. Optical microscopy, supported principally by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), was utilised in a study of surfaces for the presence of grain structure, intergranuler attack, pits, stress corrosion cracking, overlying films and their behaviour upon exposure to MON-3, as a function of time. Extensive electron spectroscopy analyses were performed utilising XPS (X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy), alternatively referred to as ESCA (Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy). XPS, was used to elucidate the elemental composition but also the “chemistry” of the surface, I.e., the combinations (compounds) in which the elements existed. AES allowed a cross-check on the elemental composition of a metal surface end provided additional information when repeated after subjecting the surface to IBM (Ion Beam Milling). Subsequent AES analyses provided data concerning the underlying layers. Repetition of the IBM/AES cycle, until base metal composition was reached, allowed deduction of the history of processing steps to which the specimens had been exposed, identification of surface films and their thickness. Taken together, the analyses demonstrated that the materials selected for the INTELSAT VII Propulsion System were satisfactory for the mission intended. © 1992 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. lnc.

A comparison of methods for collecting interstitial water for trace organic compounds and metals analyses,"Schults D.W., Ferraro S.P., Smith L.M., Roberts F.A., Poindexter C.K.",1992,Water Research,"Several common materials and methods used to collect interstitial water (IW) were evaluated to determine their effect on the accuracy and precision of measured concentrations of selected organic compounds and metals. We compared the concentration of pollutants in dosed seawater before and after exposure to stainless steel and Teflon centrifuge tubes, glass fiber and Nuclepore filters, cellulose dialysis membranes and fritted glass tubes. Exposure to most hardware materials did not significantly affect the concentration of four metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb) but there was significant loss (up to 79%) of two organic compounds (fluoranthene, p,p′-DDE) to almost all the hardware materials tested. Of five commonly used IW collection methods (centrifuging, centrifugal drainage or basal cup, squeezing, vacuum filtration and dialysis) investigated, the centrifuge method was judged the most accurate and precise for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and PCBs.

Anodic stripping voltammetry in highly‐resistive media by electrodes supported on ion‐exchange membranes,"Schiavon G., Zotti G., Toniolo R., Bontempelli G.",1991,Electroanalysis,"An electroanalytical device is described that is suitable for trace metal analysis by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) in highly‐resistive media in the absence of supporting electrolytes. It consists of a thin mercury film electrodeposited at the glassy carbon‐ion‐exchange membrane interface obtained by clamping a glassy carbon ring to one surface of a perfluorinated ion‐exchange membrane (cationic, Nafion 117, or anionic, Tosflex IE SA48). The inner surface of the membrane is in contact with an electrolyte solution (0.01 M HClO4), containing the counter and reference electrodes. The ion‐exchange membrane replaces a conventional supporting electrolyte dissolved in the analyte sample and can be regarded as a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) confined to the near neighborhood of the working electrode. This device has been used to perform differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetric (DPASV) analyses of electrolyte‐free aqueous synthetic samples containing copper and lead ions. Better results are found at glassy carbon‐supported mercury electrodes facing anionic Tosflex membranes, since similar devices assembled with cationic Nafion membranes experience a memory effect associated with blockage of metal ions, due to cation‐exchange processes that occur during the stripping redissolution step, even though these processes are able, at the same time, to lead to an increase of DPASV peaks due to metal ion accumulation near the electrode surface. Approximate detection limits of 3.5 × 10−10 M (0.02 ppb) for Cu2+ and 3 × 10−10 M (0.05 ppb) for Pb2+ are estimated at Tosflex‐equipped devices for a signal‐to‐noise ratio of 3. Possible modifications aimed at improving the performance of such a device are discussed. Copyright © 1991 VCH Publishers, Inc.",,,
Enantiospecific quantification of hexobarbital and its metabolites in biological fluids by gas chromatography/electron capture negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry,"Prakash C., Adedoyin A., Wilkinson G.R., Blair I.A.",1991,Biological Mass Spectrometry,"A highly sensitive and specific assay based on gas chromatography/electron capture negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry has been developed for the analysis of the enantiomers of hexobarbital and its major metabolites in human urine and plasma. S‐(+)‐(5‐2H3)hexobarbital and R‐(−)‐(5‐2H3)hexobarbital were synthesized for clinical studies along with (±)‐(1,5‐2H6)hexobarbital and the deuterated major metabolites for use as internal and reference standards. Hexobarbital enantiomers and their metabolites were analyzed after pentafluorobenzyl and trimethylsilyl derivatization, following solid‐phase extraction from plasma and urine. Intense negative ion spectra were observed for all of the derivatives. The base peak in the spectra corresponded to the M ‐ penta‐fluorobenzyl anion [M  PFB]− except for 1,5‐dimethylbarbituric acid, where M−· was the most abundant ion. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by following the plasma concentration‐time profiles and urinary excretion in a male extensive metabolizer of mephenytoin who was given a pseudoracemic oral dose of hexobarbital containing equal 50 mg amounts of S‐(+)‐2(H0)hexobarbital and R‐(−)‐(2H3)hexobarbital. Marked stereoselective disposition was observed, with the R‐(−)‐enantiomer being more efficiently metabolized, primarily by alicyclic oxidation and ring cleavage.

"Is heparin really necessary in the lock and, if so, how much?",Weber D.R.,1991,Annals of Pharmacotherapy,"The literature on the issue of whether heparin is necessary in an intermittent peripheral venous access device (lock) is critically reviewed. Issues explored include loss of patency, development of phlebitis, duration of lock placement, type of cannula material, sample size, risk of toxicity with heparin flush solutions, risk of clot embolism, and physical or chemical incompatibilities. Available studies indicate that heparin is not necessary to maintain fluoroethylenepropylene (FEP-Teflon) peripheral venous access devices unless the lock is used to obtain blood specimens. Considering the benefit-to-risk ratio for the use of heparin, it is advisable to maintain FEP-Teflon locks with normal saline alone. When locks are used to obtain blood specimens, as in a pharmacokinetic study, then a dilute heparin flush solution should be used. Whether heparin is necessary for the maintenance of locks composed of other materials is uncertain. Newer, less thrombogenic materials such as ethylene tetrafluoroethylene may also obviate the need for heparin, but comparative trials in a larger number of patients are needed for confirmation. When heparin is used, an effort should be made to avoid systemic toxicities by using the lowest known effective concentration (10 units/mL) pending further studies. © 1991, SAGE Publications.

"Differential Pulse Voltammetric Determination of Cobalt with a Perfluorinated Sulfonated Polymer-2,2-Bipyridyl Modified Carbon Paste Electrode","Gao Z., Wang G., Li P., Zhao Z.",1991,Analytical Chemistry,"A highly selective method for the determination of cobalt with a chemically modified carbon paste electrode Is proposed. It Is based on the chemical reactivity of an Immobilized modifier, 2,2-bipyrldyl, toward cobaH(II) Ion to yield the corresponding cation complex ((Bpy)3Co)2+, which Is taken up by another modifier, perfluorinated sulfonated polymer (Nation). Differential pulse voltammetry Is employed, and the oxidation of the complex, at +0.1 V vs SCE, Is observed. For a 5-mln preconcentration period, a linear calibration curve Is obtained for cobalt concentrations ranging from 7 × 10-7 to 1 × 10-5 mol/L, and the detection limit Is 3 × 10-7 mol/L. A lower detection limit can be obtained for longer preconcentration times. For eight preconcentratlon/determlnation/renewal cycles, the differential pulse voltammetric response could be reproduced with 4.3% relative standard deviation. Rapid and convenient acid renewal allows the use of an individual modified electrode surface In multiple analytical quantitations. Many coexisting metal Ions have little or no effect on the determination of cobalt. The procedure was applied to the determination of cobalt for four standard reference materials with relative standard deviation of 4.0-5.2%. © 1991, American Chemical Society.

Carcinogenic aromatic amine metabolism and DNA adduct detection in humans.,Kadlubar F.F.,1990,Princess Takamatsu symposia,"Human exposure to carcinogenic aromatic amines can occur from a variety of sources, including cigarette smoke and cooked foods. Initial metabolism occurs primarily in the liver and involves N-hydroxylation by cytochrome P-450IA2 and N-acetylation by acetyltransferase, which serve as competing activation and detoxification reactions, respectively. Both enzymes are polymorphic in humans and individual phenotype can be readily assessed using caffeine ingested in coffee followed by urinary metabolite analysis. N-hydroxy arylamines can then be transported through the blood where they can form protein adducts with hemoglobin or undergo renal filtration into the urinary bladder lumen where, at acidic pH, they can react covalently with urothelial DNA. Carcinogen-DNA adduct levels in human bladder are smoking-related and the C8-deoxyguanosine derivative of 4-amino-biphenyl (ABP) is a major product. Alternatively, N-hydroxy arylamines can be conjugated in the liver by glucuronyl transferases which provides a mechanism for biliary transport to the colon lumen where beta-glucuronidases can regenerate the aglycone. In the colon mucosa, acetyltransferases can further activate the N-hydroxy metabolite by O-acetylation; and persons with the rapid acetylation phenotype are known to be at higher risk for colorectal cancer. Detection of specific arylamine-DNA adducts in human colon should provide direct evidence for the role of these carcinogens in the etiology of this disease.",,acyltransferase; amine; cytochrome P450; DNA; bladder tumor; chemically induced disorder; colorectal tumor; DNA damage; drug effect; enzymology; human; intestine; liver; metabolism; physiology; review; smoking; Acetyltransferases; Amines; Colorectal Neoplasms; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; DNA; DNA Damage; Humans; Intestines; Liver; Smoking; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,
Stereochemical studies on algal pheromone biosynthesis: A model study with the flowering plant Senecio isatideus (Asteraceae),"NEUMANN C., BOLAND W.",1990,European Journal of Biochemistry,"Unsaturated C8 and C11 hydrocarbons act as chemical signals (chemotaxis) during sexual reproduction of many marine brown algae. One of these compounds, namely (+)‐(6S)‐6‐(1Z‐butenyl)cyclohepta‐1,4‐diene (=ectocarpene) is also formed as a major hydrocarbon by the flowering plant Senecio isatideus (Asteraceae). On administration of enantiospecifically labelled (8R)‐ or (8S)‐[7,8‐2H2]trideca‐3,6,9‐trienoic acid instead of the natural precursor dodeca‐3,6,9‐trienoic acid to this plant, the artificial C12 analogue of ectocarpene is formed. Mass spectroscopic analysis of the metabolites revealed this process to be enantiospecific for the C(8)‐HRe atom of the precursor acid. The stereochemical course of the overall reaction is in agreement with a precise, U‐shaped embedding of the trienoic acid into the active center of the enzyme(s) and Re‐attack onto a hydrogen at the C(8) methylene group of this precursor. The reactive intermediate cyclizes by π‐orbital interaction between C(4) and C(6) of the acid and is accompanied by decarboxylation. The first product is a thermally unstable (S,2R)‐cis‐1‐(1E3Z‐hexadienyl)‐2‐vinylcyclopropane, which immediately rearranges to (+)‐(6S)‐ectocarpene (homo‐Cope rearrangement). The present work provides first experimental evidence for a homo‐Cope rearrangement as a naturally occurring electrocyclic reaction. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell.

Structural and conformational analysis of metal-containing peptides by one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy - The case of thymulin,Laussac J.-P.,1990,Molecular and Chemical Neuropathology,"Thymulin (formerly called FTS) is a well-defined nonapeptide hormone produced by thymic epithelial cells. Its biological activity and antigenicity depend on the presence of the metal zinc in the molecule. The interaction between this metal ion and thymulin has been investigated by means of one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments. These experiments were performed in dimethyl-d6 sulfoxide solution and in aqueous medium with different metal: peptide ratios. The results are compared with those obtained for complexes of thymulin with other metal ions (Cu2+ and Al3+) and for the [Ala4]- and [Ala8]-analogs in terms of biological activity. These comparative studies suggest that the 1:1 complex is the only conformation recognized by the antibodies. From the NOESY data, a spatial conformation has been proposed for this complex. This conformation should be the physiological one and could lead to a better insight into the conformation requirements at receptor sites. © 1990 Humana Press Inc.",1D- and 2D-NMR experiments; conformational study; metal ion complexes; Thymulin; zinc-metallohormone,"metal; peptide; thymulin; zinc; animal model; animal tissue; article; central nervous system; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; review; Amino Acid Sequence; Dimethyl Sulfoxide; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Metals; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Conformation; Solutions; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Thymic Factor, Circulating; Water; Zinc; Animalia",

Monoterpenes and microbial metabolites in the soil,Jüttner F.,1990,Environmental Pollution,"Volatile microbial metabolites were analysed in the soil beneath 15 H year-old Picea abies which had been fumigated for 5 consecutive years with charcoal-filtered air enriched with ozone and sulphur dioxide. Major compounds which could be attributed to the metabolism of basidiomycete fungi were oct-1-en-3-ol, oct-1-en-3-one and 1,3-octadiene. They were accompanied by other C8-compounds. The lower amounts of C8-compounds observed in the soil of the sulphur dioxide and ozone treatment chambers indicate a reduced development of basidiomycetes. The higher amounts of geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol found in the soil of the ozone treatment chamber indicate an increase in actinomycete populations. The differences of the monoterpene patterns in the particular soils were not large enough to recognize trends unequivocally. © 1990.",,,

Nitroxide radicals as probes for water mobility in perfluorinated membrane,"Martini G., Ottaviani M.F., Ristori S., Visca M.",1989,Journal of Colloid And Interface Science,"In this paper the properties of water and of large organic ions or neutral molecules confined within the perfluorinated membrane Nafion are studied by electron spin resonance of nitroxide probes. The membrane was used in conditions of full hydration and after exchange with mono- and di-positive ions. The analysis was mainly based on the ESR lineshapes and the correlation times for the motion of positive, neutral, and negative radicals. The dependence of the lineshape on the charge of the probe and on the charge of metal ions was analyzed as a function of temperature. The behavior of adsorbed water was similar to that observed in other systems in which the liquid was finely dispersed. The decreased polarity of sorbed water as a consequence of the lower strength of the hydrogen bond, suggested by A. Falk (Canad. J. Chem. 58, 1495 (1980)) was confirmed from the AN values of nitroxides. These were located in ionic clusters and were exposed to the interactions with pendant fluorocarbon chains. The extent of these interactions depended on the charge of either the nitroxides or the exchanged metal ion. The ESR patterns invariantly arose from the superposition of many absorptions due to radicals showing different motional rates and in slow exchange among different sites. This indicated the presence of ionic clusters of variable sizes in which water moved with different diffusion coefficients. The comparison between the ESR results and the previously reported NMR results confirmed the nonuniformities in the membrane structure. © 1989.",,,
Solvent influence on trifluoromethylation reactions with Cd(CF3)2: One-pot synthesis of trifluoromethyl iron complexes,"Dukat W., Naumann D.",1989,"Journal of the Chemical Society, Dalton Transactions","Bis(trifluoromethyl)cadmium complexes Cd(CF3)2·L (L = 2CH3CN or CH3OCH2CH2OCH3) react as perfluoroalkyl Grignard reagents with carbonyl-iron halides in a one-pot reaction to yield Fe-CF3compounds easily. A strong solvent influence is observed. The dependence of the direction of the reactions, either as a trifluoromethylation or a fluorination, is discussed. In the presence of CH3CN a ligand-exchange reaction is observed, yielding trifluoromethyl iron acetonitrile complexes, while carbonyl complexes are obtained in ethers. The compound [Fe(CO)4(CF3)2] has been prepared in 65% yield, and its 19F n.m.r., i.r., Raman, mass, and Mössbauer spectra recorded. The advantage of observing the 13C satellites in the 19F n.m.r. spectra for the analysis of trifluoromethyl metal compounds is established. If the appropriate reaction conditions are used, Cd(CF3)2 complexes react as fluorination reagents and CF2 sources. Thus, on reaction of the trifluoromethyl cadmium reagents with tetracarbonyliron halides in CH3CN, diamagnetic fluoroiron acetonitrile complexes are formed.",,,

"SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF 12kh18N10T STEEL FOIL, WIRE, AND LIGHTWEIGHT ARTICLES.","Rezchkikov V.G., Usova V.A.",1986,Industrial laboratory,"The direct atomic-emission analysis of metals and alloys requires the sample to weigh no less than 30 g and to have a sparking area diameter of 10-12 mm. These requirements are not always satisfied where the sample is in the form of foil, wire, turnings, or a lightweight article. This study developed a spectral method of analyzing 12Kh18N10T steel for Ni, Cr, Mn, and Si with a relative standard deviation of 0. 02-0. 05. The samples weighed less than equivalent to 0. 3 g and contained, in %: 14-24 Cr, 5-14 Ni, 0. 5-3. 0 Mn, and 0. 4-1. 2 Si.

Analysis of single crystals of metal-borides by ICP-AES after acid-dissolution,"Takahashi Y., Higashi I., Okada S.",1986,BUNSEKI KAGAKU,"A method for microanalysis of single crystals of metal-borides grown by aluminum flux method was developed by using ICP-AES. Selected single crystals (1 to 5 mg) were dissolved with a mixture of 1 ml nitric acid (1+1) and 0.05 ml sulfuric acid (1+1) in a Teflon-lined bomb by heating at 150°C for 3 h. Some borides (e.g. i-, Cr-, Nb- and Ta-borides) were found to be insoluble or partly soluble in the mixture. For complete dissolution of the borides, an addition of 0.2 ml hydrofluoric acid (1+1) was necessary. Tests for recovery of pure crystalline boron showed that the leakage of boron from the bomb was negligible in the presence of hydrofluoric acid. When the sample solutions containing the acid were sprayed into the ICP through a borosilicate glass sample introduction system (a nebulizer and a spray chamber), the background intensity of boron increased and seriously interfered the determination of the element. The difficulty was overcome by the use of a quartz or a commercial Teflon sample introduction system, the former system being superior to the latter both in simplicity of construction and in repeatability of measurements. Owing to the lack of certified and homogeneous standards, it was difficult to determine precision and accuracy of the method. But tentative standard deviations of boron/metal atomic ratio were obtained for TiB2 and ZrB2 as follows: B/Ti=1.92±0.04, B/Zr=1.99±0.044. © 1986, The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry.

Recommendations for analytical methods of heavy metals in bird eggs and feathers with atomic-absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) [Empfehlungen zur Analysenmethode von Schwermetallen in Vogeleiern und Federn mit Hilfe der Atomabsorptionsspektroskopie (AAS)],Kooiker G.,1986,Journal of Ornithology,"Theoretical and practical hints for the detection of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb und Zn) in bird eggs and feathers with the help of AAS (Flame and Grapite-Furnace), are given. Before starting the metal analysis with AAS, great errors are possible, especially when preparing and digesting the samples. Therefore great care and accuracy is necessary. In order to keep digestion system free of contamination, tightly closed quartzglass flasks and acid digestion bombs (Teflon) must be used. Addition of slight quantities of acids are recommended as well. The concentration of Fe and Zn in the matrices are high enough being determined by the flame atomic absorption. If the concentrations of Cd, Cu and Pb are high enough, they can be determined with this technique as well. However, they are normally analysed by means of the rather complicated flameless operation (Graphite-Tube). The sample solution cannot be measured directly in the graphite cuvette, since chemical and physical interferences do arise. Many matrix effects can be eliminated by using a proper dilution with double dest. water. If the results obtained are not reproducible the ""addition method"" must be used. The difficulties of trace element analysis (Cd, Cu and Pb) in eggshells is especially mentioned, and a procedure of extraction with methyl isobutyl ketone/ammonium pyrollidine dithiocarbamate (MIBK/APDC) is indicated. © 1986 Verlag der Deutschen Ornithologen-Gesellschaft.",,,Springer-Verlag
Simultaneous multielement analysis of certified reference material “Hair” by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry,"Ghen G.J., Hasegawa T., Haragughi H., Nojiri Y.",1985,BUNSEKI KAGAKU,"Simultaneous multielement analysis of certified reference material “Hair”, which was issued from the National Institute for Environmental Studies, has been investigated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (IGP-AES). The hair sample was dried at 85 °G for 4 h, and cooled for 30 min in a desiccator. The sample (ca. 250 mg) was digested with HNO3-HF-HCIO4 or ashed at 450-600 °C. The acid digestion was performed in a sealed Teflon vessel at 140 °C for 4 h. The ashed sample was treated with HGl and HF to dissolve the sample. The digested or ashed sample was finally diluted to 25 ml. The spectral interference and analytical figures of merit were examined to evaluate the analytical feasibilities of IGP-AES for hair analysis. Trace metals (Al, As, Ba, Ga, Gr, Gu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Sr, Ti, and Zn) were detected in the hair sample, and the analytical results were compared with the reported values. The measured values for most elements were reasonable, although the concentrations of Ca, Al, Fe, and Ti were very high probably because of the contamination in the preparation procedure of the certified ard reference material. © 1985, The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry.

The procedure utilizes the ion‐pairing reagent, bis(2‐ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid, which frees the amines from most contaminants and permits the efficient extraction of the amphoteric compounds (as acetates) from the aqueous solution. Amines I and III and acetylated amines II and IV were perfluoro‐acetylated prior to GC‐EC analysis. Metabolism of I, II, and III in the rat brain was studied. Results indicate that both in vivo and in vitro amines I and III are p‐hydroxylated to II and IV, respectively, and II is β‐hydroxylated to give IV.

The N6- and C8-substituted analogs of cyclic AMP (10-100 μM) were not cleared as rapidly as exogenous cyclic AMP and were metabolized: N6- and C8-substituted analogs of adenosine accumulated in perfusate and urine. All analogs exhibited net transtubular secretion, i.e. their urinary excretion rate > glomerular filtration rate. Probenecid (0.9 mM) included in the perfusate abolished transtubular secretion and inhibited the metabolism of PCPT-cyclic AMP, suggesting that cyclic AMP analogs, like cyclic AMP itself, penetrate the renal cell at the peritubular membrane by an organic acid transport system. The phosphorothioate diastereomers of cyclic AMP: cAMPS(Sp) and cAMPS(Rp) were cleared as rapidly from the perfusate as cyclic AMP, were extensively secreted (urinary excretion/ glomerular filtration ≧100) and exhibited no metabolism. The latter analog would seem most suitable as an intracellular agonist for cyclic AMP-mediated phenomena in the rat kidney. © 1983.",,"adenosine 3',5' phosphorothioate; cyclic amp derivative; inulin; probenecid; radioisotope; animal cell; drug metabolism; kidney; kidney cell; kidney perfusion; macrogol h 3; nonhuman; rat; Animal; Biological Transport; Cyclic AMP; Kidney; Male; Perfusion; Protein Kinases; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Thionucleotides",

The behavior of three different types of materials in vitro and in the dynamic physiological environment: review and analyses of critical parameters,Bruck S.D.,1979,International Journal of Artificial Organs,"A comparative analysis of smooth-surfaced synthetic materials, gels, especially those based on polyacrylamide, and polyester flocked surfaces indicate profound differences between these three types of materials when in contact with blood. Although many smooth-surfaced materials adsorb fibrinogen in vitro, several of these perform well in vivo without polymerization of fibrinogen to fibrin leading to clot-formation apparently because of enzymatic reactions in the physiological environment. Polyacrylamide hydrogels adsorb little plasma proteins, show negligible platelet adhesion and activation. In contrast, polyester flocked (fibril) surfaces deposit large quantities of fibrinogen that polymerize to fibrin with entrapped formed blood elements (clot). The thickness of this layer is difficult to control and the build-up continues to a thickness up to approximately 400 to 600 μm depending on the species. The danger of clot-fragmentation and flock-detachment especially during flexing makes these rough surfaces inferior in blood-contacting applications, in comparison to the best current synthetic smooth-surfaced biomaterials, hydrogels, and chemically modified natural tissue components.",,albumin; biomaterial; elastomer; fibrinogen; immunoglobulin; polyacrylamide; polyetherurethan; polypropylene; polyvinylchloride; radioisotope; analyzer; animal experiment; blood and hemopoietic system; blood compatibility; dog; drug comparison; drug interaction; ethylcellulose perfluorobutyrate; gel; human cell; in vitro study; pharmacokinetics; polyalkylsulfone; polyester resin; prosthesis; protein i 125; survey; tetramethyldisiloxane polymer; theoretical study; thrombocyte adhesiveness; thrombosis; Acrylamides; Adsorption; Biocompatible Materials; Blood; Blood Proteins; Fibrinogen; Gels; Human; In Vitro; Polyesters; Polymers; Polyurethanes; Surface Properties; Thromboembolism; Thrombosis,

Improved sodium and PAH transport in the isolated fluorocarbon-perfused rat kidney,"Franke H., Malyusz M., Runge D.",1978,Nephron,"The effect of an artificial O2 carrier (emulsion of the perfluorochemical FC43® with Pluronic-F-108®) on the functional capability of the isolated perfused rat kidney was tested. In control series hydroxyethyl starch (HES) instead of fluorocarbon was used. Improving O2 supply in FC 43 experiments raised Na reabsorption to 149 μmol/g x min compared to 84.1 μmol/g x min in HES experiments. In the presence of PAH, however, Na reabsorption in FC 43 experiments was only 115 μmol/g x min. In both series, perfusion flow, calculated on the basis of C(PAH), remained below the directly measured flow rate, unless analysis included all metabolites of PAH. N-acetylated metabolites of PAH were released at a 5 times higher rate by kidneys perfused with FC 43 than by HES-perfused organs. These results demonstrate that sufficient O2 supply is critical both for reabsorption of Na+ and for handling of PAH. Increased tubular Na reabsorption in the absence of PAH indicates that even during perfusion with O2 43 Ob2 supply is marginal.",,4 aminohippuric acid; fluorocarbon; inulin c 14; oxygen; perfluorotributylamine; pluronic f 108; radioisotope; sodium; unclassified drug; animal experiment; article; controlled study; drug absorption; kidney; kidney perfusion; rat; regional perfusion,
Analysis of unconjugated steroids in plasma by liquid-gel chromatography and glass capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry,"Axelson M., Sjövall J.",1977,Journal of Steroid Biochemistry,"A method is described for analysis of metabolic profiles of unconjugated steroids in plasma. After extraction by Amberlite XAD-2 at 64°, the steroids are purified by filtration through a 0.5 g column of sulphoethyl Sephadex LH-20 in methanol, and by chromatography on a 0.5 g column of triethyl-aminohydroxypropyl-hydroxyalkyl Sephadex LH-20. The latter column is used in a reversed-phase system which separates neutral steroids as a group from less polar lipids, and yields phenolic steroids in a separate fraction. The neutral steroids are converted into MO-TMS derivatives which are purified by rapid filtration through a 0.25 g column of Lipidex 5000 in hexane containing pyridine, hexameth-yidisilazane and dimethoxypropane to prevent hydrolysis of TMS ethers. Estrogens are converted into TMS ethers. The recoveries of added [3H]-labelled neutral steroids and estrogens are about 85%. Sample sizes corresponding to 1-2 ml plasma can be injected onto glass capillary columns. The derivatives are analyzed by repetitive scanning GC-MS using a glass capillary column connected via a single-stage adjustable jet separator. Metal surfaces are deactivated with water glass and benzyltri-phenylphosphonium chloride, and a Teflon coupling device is used for glass-glass capillary connections. Characterization and quantitation of steroids is based on computer construction of fragment ion current chromatograms. When the method was applied to the analysis of unconjugated steroids in plasma from pregnant women, 27 steroids in the concentration range 1-300 ng/ml could be identified.

Measurements of the airborne mass of lead, zinc and cadmium indicated 17%, 32% and 37% in the size range greater than 10 μm (aerodynamic diameter) respectively. Calculations based on these data showed about 70% of the total mass deposition for each metal was due to sedimentation of these large particles. The bulk of the airborne mass of these metals, in particles much smaller than 10 μm, played only a minor role in the deposition process. © 1977.",,METAL ANALYSIS; TRACE METALS; AIR POLLUTION,

Atomic Absorption Procedure for Analysis of Metals in Atmospheric Particulate Matter,"Ranweiler L.E., Moyers J.L.",1974,Environmental Science and Technology,"A procedure has been developed for the multielement analysis of atmospheric particulate matter by atomic absorption spectrometry. Atmospheric particulate samples are collected on polystyrene filters using hi-vol samplers. The filters are dry ashed at 400–425°C and the residue is dissolved with a mixture of HF, HCl, and HNO3 in Teflon acid digestion bombs. With the appropriate dilutions and matrix corrections, it is possible quantitatively to measure 22 metals in atmospheric particulate matter. The elements measured by this procedure are Si, Al, Ca, Fe, K, Na, Mg, Pb, Cu, Ti, Zn, Sr, Ni, V, Mn, Cr, Rb, Li, Bi, Co, Cs, and Be. Although it is possible to observe Cd in samples collected and prepared by this technique, it is probable that Cd is partially volatilized during ashing of the sample. Recovery data for the ashing and dissolution of synthetic samples added to the filter material are presented. Data are also presented for the atmospheric concentration of elements in particulate samples analyzed by this procedure. © 1974, American Chemical Society.

Nondestructive analysis for trace amounts of hydrogen,"Cohen B.L., Fink C.L., Degnan J.H.",1972,Journal of Applied Physics,"A method is described and demonstrated for a nondestructive determination of the hydrogen content inside materials in sheet form by measurement of the energy-loss distribution from proton-proton scattering events. The method is absolutely specific for hydrogen, and has a sensitivity of 1 ppm (atomic), or better. Materials analyzed (with ppm of hydrogen in parentheses) were: Ti (4200), Zr (5000), Al (20), Fe (∼ 10), C (13000), and Teflon (220). In the titanium and zirconium samples, the hydrogen content drops off near the surfaces. The method also detects oil or moisture on surfaces for thicknesses down to about 1 Å; all materials studied had such surface films several hundred Å thick. © 1972 The American Institute of Physics.",,NONDESTRUCTIVE ANALYSIS; NUCLEAR SCATTERING; METAL ANALYSIS,
Origin of organic matter in early solar system-V. Further studies of meteoritic hydrocarbons and a discussion of their origin,"H. Studier M., Hayatsu R., Anders E.",1972,Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta,"The Murchison meteorite contains aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons similar to those made in static Fischer-Tropsch-type syntheses. Principal compound classes above C8 are n-alkanes, mono- and dimethylalkanes, alkenes, alkylbenzenes and -naphthalenes. Below C8, n-alkanes are virtually absent; instead, benzene, toluene, branched alkanes dominate. The CH4/C2H6 ratio is greater than 30, possibly greater than 700. Isoprenoids from C17 to C20 occur in a surface rinse but not in subsequent extracts and appear to be terrestrial contaminants. Thiophenes, porphyrin-like pigments and chlorobenzenes were also found; the latter appear to be contaminants. In the Allende meteorite, only methane, benzene, toluene and an aromatic polymer seem to be indigenous. A comprehensive review of current evidence shows that Fischer-Tropsch-type reactions can account for most principal features of meteorite organic matter: hydrocarbons, nitrogen bases, amino acids, carbon-isotope fractionations and possibly pigments. Some features (aromatic hydrocarbons) require a reheating stage; others such as S- and Cl-compounds and the aromatic 'polymer' remain unexplained and need to be investigated. No other process is known at present that accounts for an equally wide range of evidence. © 1972.",,,
Nature of carbon-halogen bonds,Mikhailov B.M.,1971,Russian Chemical Reviews,"This paper is a critical review of the literature on the problem of the nature of carbon-halogen bonds. It examines the various physical properties of halogen-containing organic compounds which are useful in discussing the problem of the chemical bond (infrared spectra, dipole moments, interatomic distances, nuclear quadrupole interaction constants, nuclear magnetic resonance). Special attention is paid to results from nuclear magnetic resonance, which show the uselessness of treating the properties of organohalogen compounds from the position of mesomerism-resonance theory. The correlation between the chemical shifts of nuclear magnetic resonance and the ff-constants of the substituents in various organohalogen compounds is considered. Attention is paid to the hybridisation of the orbitals of the carbon and halogen atoms and to the associated electronic displacements in unsaturated and aromatic systems. © 1971 American Mathematical Society.",,,
Lesions due to complement in lipid membranes,"Hesketh T.R., Dourmashkin R.R., Payne S.N., Humphrey J.H., Lachmann P.J.",1971,Nature,"WHEN cells are lysed by antibody and complement (C), uniform bubbles or ""holes"" revealed by negative staining in the electron microscope appear at the surface. These lesions are probably due to micelle formation in the surface lipid layer (evidence reviewed in ref. 1). C activated by antibody through C8 has also been shown to damage liposomes containing Forssman antigen in their lipid membranes2,3, though not to make holes in them 4. C activated in the ""reactive lysis"" system (involving attachment to erythrocyte membranes or other hydrophobic surfaces of an unstable C&amp;567bar; complex which in turn interacts with C8 and C95) causes typical lesions in erythrocyte membranes6 and in lecithin liposomes7. © 1971 Nature Publishing Group.",,"complement; hapten; lipid; animal; antigen antibody reaction; article; cell membrane; electron microscopy; erythrocyte; guinea pig; hemolysis; human; isolation and purification; membrane; rabbit; sheep; Animal; Antigen-Antibody Reactions; Cell Membrane; Complement; Erythrocytes; Guinea Pigs; Haptens; Hemolysis; Human; Lipids; Membranes; Microscopy, Electron; Rabbits; Sheep",
Polarographic Studies in Aqueous Hydrofluoric Acid Using AC and DC Rapid Techniques,"Bond A.M., O'Donnell T.A.",1969,Analytical Chemistry,"Conventional polarographic procedures cannot be used in hydrofluoric acid solutions because of etching of the glass capillary of the DME. However, very rapid polarographic techniques with both ac and dc polarography have been shown to be effective because insignificant glass attack occurs in the short scan time. The necessity of constructing a DME from Teflon (Du Pont) or other hydrofluoric acid resistant material is therefore removed. The method has been applied to the systems Cd(ll), Tl(l), Pb(ll), Sn(ll), Bi(lll), Mo(VI) and U(VI) in 5 to 40% hydrofluoric acid solutions. The polarographic characteristics of most electrode reactions studied in aqueous hydrofluoric acid are consistent with those expected in a solution containing a weak acid. Analytically, the most significant feature is that, for any particular concentration of metal, the value obtained in most cases is independent of wide variations in the hydrofluoric acid concentration. This simplifies analysis of mineralogical and metallurgical samples which must be dissolved in hydrofluoric acid. © 1969, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.",,,
DESIGN OF EXPANDER AND PISTON RINGS IN NONLUBRICATED COMPRESSOR PACKINGS,SLAVIN IYU,1969,Chem & Petroleum Eng (English translation of Khimicheskoe i Neftyanoe Mashinostroenie),"Piston compressors working without cylinder and stuffing box lubrication, in the chemical industry, can be efficiently operated only if the maximum allowable wear of the piston rings is correctly determined. The preliminary pressing of a Teflon ring against the surface is ensured by a metal expander ring. An analysis of the forces acting on the expander ring, and the interaction between the elastic forces of the expander ring and the forces produced in the piston ring, is presented, and design nomograms are developed. As a rule, the maximum allowable radial wear, determined from the condition of minimum specificpressure, is greater than that determined from the strength condition of the slot cut projection, particularly when the pressure drops acting on the piston ring are substantial. Consequently, for h-p piston seals, for which typically there is a considerable pressure drop across the rings, piston rings with an overlapping slot cut are unsuitable if the seal is not absolutely perfect.",,Seals,
Perturbation Measurement of Transverse R/Q in Iris-Loaded Waveguides,"Hahn H., Halama H.J.",1968,IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques,"The measurement of transverse R/Q in iris-loaded waveguides by perturbation techniques is described. The underlying perturbation theory for resonant cavities is reviewed, and formulas for metallic needles, a sapphire rod, and a teflon bead are given. A calibration of the perturbing objects in TM010 and TM110 cavities shows good agreement with theory. Conventional oscillator and transmission methods are compared, and a systematic error of the oscillator method is explained. A more sensitive null method is described. A definition of the transverse R/ Q is given, from which it follows that the knowledge of the longitudinal electric field component is sufficient to determine the deflecting properties of a structure. The accuracy of perturbation measurements was tested on a cavity for which the R/Q was known from computer calculations and deflection tests. It was found that the various values agree to within 20 percent. Perturbation measurements of deflectors with small coupling holes showed the theoretically predicted interaction parameters. Values close to 2.2 kΩ/m at 2.856 GHz were measured on a ¾r wave structure with about a 2-cm beam hole. Copyright © 1968 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.",,,
The Crystal and Molecular Structure of Racemic Iodocarbonyl-π-cyclopentadienyl-pentafluoroethylrhodium,Churchill M.R.,1965,Inorganic Chemistry,"Iodocarbonyl-π-cyclopentadienyl-pentafluoroethylrhodium, π-C5H5Rh(CO)(C2F6)I, crystallizes as an ordered racemate in space group P21/c, with a = 12.410 ± 0.010, b = 7.823 ± 0.008, c = 12.632 ± 0.010 Å.; β = 109.86 ± 0.05°. A three-dimensional single-crystal X-ray analysis, based on 960 independent reflections, using conventional Patterson, Fourier, and least-squares refinement techniques has led to the location of all atoms except hydrogens, with estimated standard deviations ranging from 0.003 Å. for the rhodium-iodine vector to 0.04 Å. for carbon-carbon distances. The final value for the discrepancy index, R1, is 6.98%. An interesting result of the analysis is that the rhodium-carbon bond distance for the perfluoroethyl group is only 0.11 Å. longer than the rhodium-carbonyl bond length. On allowing for the 0.07 Å. difference in the radii of sp3 and sp hybridized carbon atoms, the effective difference in rhodium-carbon bond lengths decreases to only 0.04 Å. (~1.3σ). This, coupled with the distortion of the α carbon atom of the perfluoroethyl group from a regular tetrahedral environment, gives some weight to the proposal that the perfluoroethyl group participates in metal-ligand (dπ-σ∗) back donation. A comparison with known metal-carbon bond lengths suggests that for certain transition metal complexes, the metal-perfluoroalkyl linkage may be some 0.2-0.3 Å. shorter than the metal-carbon bond in an analogous nonfluorinated metal-alkyl. © 1965, American Chemical Society.

Polarization effect in positon backscattering,"Bisi A., Fiorentini A., Zappa L.",1965,Nuclear Physics,"The polarization of positons from a β+ emitter just prior to capture in a positonium atom was measured in Teflon with different metal backings, by analysing the time annihilation spectra in the presence of a magnetic field. It was found that the polarization decreases with increasing atomic number Z of the backing. In the limit of very low Z it attains a value compatible with what would be expected in the extreme assumption of absence of any depolarizing processes. At high Z the polarization of the backscattered beam appears to be reversed if compared with what of the direct beam. © 1965.",measured β-polarization before and after backscattering; RADIOACTIVITY 22Na,,
